Preface 
Volume 39 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels contains 
their letters to each other and to third persons from 1852 to 1855. 
The letters in this volume give us a glimpse of the creative 
methods of Marx and Engels, the background to their theoretical 
writings from 1852 to 1855, and of the genesis of many of their 
theories. These letters cover the period of political reaction that 
descended on Europe with the defeat of the 1848-49 revolution. 
From 1852 to 1855 fairly substantial changes took place in the 
world's economic and political life. The economic boom that had 
begun at the end of the 1840s in Europe proved unstable. There 
were already signs, in 1853, of another economic crisis that came 
to a head in 1857 and reached world dimensions for the first time. 
The Crimean War broke out in 1853, and this substantially 
changed the distribution of political forces on the Continent and 
influenced the internal development of a number of leading 
European powers. 
The economic and political processes that took place in this 
period did much to determine the nature of the scientific and 
practical activities undertaken by Marx and Engels. From 1851 
their main objectives were the further development of economic 
theory and research. Marx's scientific studies in this field were 
temporarily interrupted in 1852, when he and Engels concen­
trated on the theoretical generalisation of the results of the 
revolution, on the struggle against police persecution of 
members of the Communist League, and on the unmasking of the 
divisive activities of the sectarian elements in the League and the

XVIII Preface 
pseudo-revolutionary pronouncements of various petty-bourgeois 
refugee groups. From 1853 to 1855, Marx and Engels followed 
with intense and unflagging interest the development of the 
conflict over the so-called Eastern Question and the course of the 
Crimean War. Throughout all these years, as in the previous 
period, they were both still principally concerned with the 
struggle for the proletarian party, for the organisational and 
ideological unity and education of the proletarian revolutionaries, 
and for the preservation and development of the proletariat's 
international connections. 
In the personal lives of Marx and Engels, these years were 
among the most difficult. The harsh privations of life in 
emigration cost Marx and his wife Jenny the lives of two of their 
children, the one-year-old Franziska and the eight-year-old Edgar. 
Extremely difficult conditions constantly undermined Marx's 
health. Engels at this period was forced to give much of his time 
to commerce, which compelled him to renounce many research 
plans;  however, this work provided a living not only for  himself, 
but for the Marx family. In addition, as we see from many of their 
letters, Marx and Engels were preoccupied throughout these years 
with their comrades and sympathisers living in poverty in 
emigration or languishing in German prisons. 
The letters in this volume, as in Volume 38, reflect the 
enormous amount of work done by Marx and Engels on the 
theoretical analysis of the experience of the 1848-49 revolution. 
During the first months of 1852, Marx wrote one of his 
outstanding works, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see 
present edition, Vol. 11). The material in this volume makes it 
possible to trace clearly the story of the publication as well as of 
the writing of this work, set down immediately after the 
counter-revolutionary coup in France on 2 December 1851. In 
addition, the letters contain an analysis of the processes at work 
after The Eighteenth Brumaire was written, at a time when Louis 
Bonaparte had consolidated his regime and was preparing to 
proclaim the Empire (see Engels to Weydemeyer on 30 January, 
Engels to Marx on 18 March, and Marx to Engels on 23 
September 1852). 
Marx's letter to Weydemeyer of 5 March 1852 is a very 
important document that seems directly to continue the theoretical 
generalisation of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. In it, 
Marx briefly outlined the substance of his revolutionary deduc-

tions about the world historical role of the proletariat, the 
innovation that he introduced into the theory of the classes and 
the class struggle. 'Now as for  myself,  I do not claim to have 
discovered either the existence of classes in modern society or the 
struggle between them. Long before me, bourgeois historians had 
described the historical development of this struggle between the 
classes, as had bourgeois economists their economic anatomy. My 
own contribution was 1. to show that the existence of classes is 
merely bound up with certain historical phases in the development of 
production; 2. that the class struggle necessarily leads to the 
dictatorship of the proletariat; 3. that this dictatorship itself 
constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes 
and to a classless society' (see this volume, pp. 62-65). Noting the 
enormous theoretical value of this letter, Lenin wrote: 'In these 
words, Marx succeeded in expressing with striking clarity, first, the 
chief and radical difference between his theory and that of the 
foremost and most profound thinkers of the bourgeoisie; and, 
secondly, the essence of his theory of the state' (V. I. Lenin, 
Collected Works, Vol. 25, p. 411). 
The correspondence contains much interesting information 
about the writing- of Engels' work, Revolution and Counter-
Revolution in Germany (see present edition, Vol. 11), in which 
Engels examines the prerequisites, nature and motive forces of the 
1848-49 revolution in the German states from the standpoint of 
historical materialism. The letters in this volume show clearly how 
much creative contact there was between Marx and Engels in the 
composition of this work (see, for instance, Engels' letters to Marx 
of 29 January and 29 April, and Marx's letter to Engels of 18 
February 1852). 
A large part in the life of Marx and Engels in 1852 and the first 
half of 1853 was taken up by practical revolutionary activity. In an 
atmosphere reflecting the general decline of the revolutionary 
movement, Marx and Engels had to wage an intensive struggle 
against ideas alien to the working class and against revolutionary 
adventurism; they also had to overcome the pusillanimity, apathy 
and ignorance of certain members of the movement. 
Of particular interest in this connection is the correspondence 
with Weydemeyer and Cluss, Communist League members who 
had emigrated to the USA. Marx and Engels supported in every 
way the aspirations of these two men to organise the publication in 
the USA of a German-language weekly, Die Revolution. Marx's The 
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and Engels' article 'England' 
(see present edition, Vol. 11) were specially written for it. Seeing

XX Preface 
contributions to the magazine as an important party task, Marx, as 
his wife Jenny wrote to Weydemeyer on 13 February 1852, had 
'commandeered on your behalf pretty well all available communist 
quills',  that is to say, Wilhelm  Wolff,  Georg Wecth, Ferdinand 
Wolff,  Ernest Jones, Wilhelm Pieper, Johann Eccarius and 
Ferdinand Freiligrath (p. 35). 
For nearly three years, Cluss and Weydemeyer drew on letters 
from Marx and Engels when writing their own articles, which were 
printed in the American and German-American democratic press, 
and especially in the newspaper Die Reform, published in New 
York (see Marx's letters to Cluss of 17 April, about 14 June, 18 
October, mid-November 1853, and others). 
In England, Marx and Engels actively assisted and supported 
the proletarian publications being brought out by Ernest Jones, 
leader of the Left-wing Chartists. In Ernest Jones's Notes to  the People, 
Marx wrote, 'you will find all the day-to-day history of the English 
proletariat' (see this volume, p. 42). They contributed to The  People's 
Paper themselves and induced others to contribute likewise 
(Eccarius, Pieper, Cluss and their associates), and took part in the 
actual editorial work (see Marx's letters to Engels of 2 September and 
23 September 1852 and 23 November 1853). 
The advanced development of capitalist industry in England 
and its huge working class, together with the revolutionary 
traditions of Chartism, gave Marx and Engels grounds to assume 
that conditions existed there for the creation of a mass proletarian 
party. As their letters show, Marx and Engels helped Jones and 
other Left-wing Chartist leaders during these years to reorganise 
the National Charter Association, believing that the struggle for 
the rebirth of the Chartist movement was vital for the political 
unification of the proletariat in England. It was only natural that 
they constantly followed the progress of the strike movement of 
the English working class (see, for example, Marx's letter to Engels 
of 30 September 1853). 
The struggle for the independence of the working-class 
movement and its freedom from other class influences was a 
matter of constant concern to Marx and Engels. They condemned 
in the strongest terms the shift towards bourgeois radicalism on 
the part of George Julian Harney, the former Chartist leader, and 
had a high opinion of the revolutionary firmness of Ernest Jones, 
who opposed the efforts of the reformists. 'Jones is moving in 
quite the right direction,' wrote Engels to Marx on 18 March 1852, 
'and we may well say that, without our doctrine, he would not 
have taken the right path' (see this volume, p. 68). When Jones

later began vacillating and seemed inclined to make concessions to 
the petty-bourgeois democrats, Marx reacted with much disap­
proval (see Marx's letter to Engels of 13 February 1855). 
The correspondence reflects the fierce ideological battle fought 
by Marx and Engels against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois 
democrats who were trying to divert the proletarian rev­
olutionaries from the real objectives of the class struggle. Mazzini, 
Kossuth, Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc were all criticised for 
ignoring the objective economic laws and for their subjectivist 
approach to crucial decisions, as well as for their extremely limited 
social programmes and their Bonapartist illusions. Moreover, 
Marx and Engels firmly rejected the conspiratorial tactics of 
Mazzini and his adherents (see, in particular, Engels' letter to 
Marx of 11 February and Marx's letter to Engels of 23 February 
1853). 
Marx and Engels were implacably hostile to the internal 
squabbles of the various petty-bourgeois refugee organisations 
which were turning political activity into careerism and intrigue 
and were threatening to discredit the revolutionary movement. 
The letters reveal the background to their joint authorship of the 
richly comic satirical pamphlet, The Great Men of the Exile (see 
present edition, Vol. 11) in which they denounced the fatuous 
self-importance and the futile activities of the leaders of the 
German petty-bourgeois emigration (Kinkel, Rüge, Heinzen, 
Struve and others). 
The founders of Marxism saw a particular danger at this time in 
the activities of the Willich-Schapper separatist group which had 
caused a split in the Communist League in 1850. Its pseudo-
revolutionary catch-phrases and adventurism brought down police 
repression on many League members, especially the German 
workers. Marx wrote angrily to Engels on 30 August 1852: '...from 
a secure hiding-place, they are playing into the hands of the 
German governments, especially the Prussian, for the purpose of 
pseudo-agitation and self-aggrandisement' (p. 169). 
The adventurism of the Willich-Schapper group took a particu­
larly dangerous turn, since in 1852 there began in Cologne a trial 
trumped up by the Prussian police against the communists. This 
volume (and Volume 38) illustrates Marx's and Engels' struggle, 
from the very start of the investigation (in May 1851), against the 
provocatory nature of its preparation and conduct, and against the 
inhuman treatment of the detainees. Through press agitation and 
publicity they did all they could to protect the communists from 
slander and treachery and to unmask the forgeries and irregularities

of the Prussian police and court authorities (see, for example, the 
letters of Marx to Engels of 24 January, Engels to Marx of 28 
January, and Marx to Cluss of 7 and about 15 May 1852). 
Marx and Engels were particularly active during the trial itself 
in October and November 1852, when they virtually handled the 
defence of the accused, supplying the lawyers with the necessary 
material. A picture of the tremendous work done at the time by 
Marx, Engels and their comrades in the Communist League is 
given by a letter from Jenny Marx to Cluss of 30 October 1852, 
published in the Appendices to this volume. The outstanding 
contribution to the struggle to expose the Cologne communist trial 
was Marx's pamphlet, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in 
Cologne (see present edition, Vol. 11), the background to which 
can be traced in the letters in this volume. Attributing great 
importance to the publication and distribution of this work, which 
denounced the entire Prussian governmental system, Marx wrote 
to Cluss on 25 March 1853: '...at the present moment, we could 
deal our beloved Prussians no more telling blow' (p. 299). 
After sentence had been passed in Cologne on the Communist 
League members, Marx organised, through Cluss, the collection in 
the USA of money for assistance to the condemned men and their 
families. On 7 December 1852, sending Cluss a written appeal for 
the collection of money, Marx wrote: 'Here it is a matter of ... a 
definite party aim whose fulfilment is demanded by the honour of 
the workers' party' (p. 260). 
After the Cologne trial, it became clear that it would be 
inadvisable to continue, under conditions of reaction, the activities 
of the Communist League as a relatively narrow illegal organisa­
tion. On 19 November 1852, Marx informed Engels that, at his 
suggestion, a resolution had been passed by the London District of 
the Communist League on the disbanding of the organisation. 
After the League had been dissolved, Marx, Engels and their 
associates continued, in other forms, their activities in welding 
together the ranks of the proletariat so that the best revolutionary 
and internationalist traditions of the Communist League should be 
absorbed and spread by successive generations of participants in 
the proletarian struggle. Their correspondence, in particular, 
shows that even during the years after the Communist League 
ceased to exist, Marx and Engels maintained contact with 
representatives of the proletarian movement in various countries. 
As if summing up what had been achieved, and setting up the 
targets for the proletarian revolutionaries in the period of reaction 
and the movement's temporary decline, Engels wrote to

Preface XXIII 
Weydemeyer on 12 April 1853: '...German communism ... has 
passed its matriculation' (see this volume, p. 308). Engels noted the 
heightened ideological level of Marx's adherents and their 
preparedness for new revolutionary battles: '...the Marx party does 
do a good deal of swotting, and one only has to look at the way the 
other émigré jackasses snap up this or that new catchword, thereby 
becoming more bemused than ever, to realise that our party's 
superiority has increased both absolutely and relatively. As indeed it 
must, for la besogne sera rude [it will be a tough business]' (p. 309). 
Engels' letter, marking out the line of conduct for the proletarian 
revolutionaries under the conditions of an expected upsurge in the 
movement, was an extremely important example of how to decide 
the tactics of the proletarian party in the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution. 
After the close of the Cologne trial and the publication of 
Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, Marx and 
Engels once again concentrated their main efforts on theoretical 
research. Their letters from 1853 to 1855 testify to the scope and 
variety of their scientific interests. Apart from the works and 
articles published during these years, several dozen of Marx's 
notebooks have been preserved with plans, copied passages and 
notes concerned primarily with economic problems and also with 
the history of Europe, the Orient and Ancient Rome, the 
problems of the colonial policy pursued by England and other 
capitalist states, and so on. Engels began studying the theory of 
war more intensively, and also world history, philology and other 
sciences. 
The urgent theoretical elaboration of the problems of economics 
and the criticism of bourgeois political economy were not dictated 
by scientific interest alone, as Marx had already shown by the 
mid-40s, but also by the objective demands of arming the 
revolutionary proletariat ideologically. Economic theory was to 
introduce the maximum clarity into the understanding of the 
relationship between labour and capital. Consequently, Engels 
regarded the completion of Marx's economic research as most 
urgent. 'You ought to finish your Economy,' he wrote to Marx on 
11 March 1853, 'later on, as soon as we have a newspaper, we 
could bring it out in WEEKLY NUMBERS... This would provide all our 
by then restored associations with a basis for debate' (p. 293). 
In the first half of the 1850s, Marx made important progress in 
preparing the ground for a revolution in the science of 
economics—the discovery of the tendencies underlying the

capitalist mode of production. However, as is shown by the 
above-quoted letter from Engels, and also by Marx's letter to Cluss 
of 15 September 1853 (p. 367), neither Engels nor Marx himself yet 
realised how much ground had to be covered before the appearance 
of the first volume of Capital. 
Meanwhile, the letters in this volume are convincing testimony 
that certain propositions of Marx's political economy had become 
known even before the appearance of the first part of A 
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy and Capital. Marx 
frequently expounded his economic views in his letters to Engels, 
Lassalle, and also Cluss and Weydemeyer. He endeavoured in this 
way to arm his associates for the battle of ideas with the 
petty-bourgeois democrats and their ideologues. For example, in 
his letter to Weydemeyer of 5 March 1852, already quoted above, 
in his letter to Engels of 14 June 1853 and in the letters to Cluss 
of 5 and 18 October 1853, Marx severely criticised the vulgar 
bourgeois economist Henry Charles Carey, whose views on the 
'harmony of classes' in the USA had become fairly widespread by 
this time. Marx dwelt on certain peculiarities in the development 
of capitalism in the USA, on its place in the general system of 
capitalist relations, and on its competitive struggle with English 
capital and the resulting specific nature of development of 
American economic thought. Carey's views, wrote Marx, show 
that 'in the United States bourgeois society is still far too 
immature for the class struggle to be made perceptible and 
comprehensible' (p. 62). 
Marx notes in his letters the decline of bourgeois political 
economy, and the marked tendency among the epigones of the 
English classical school of economists to distort and vulgarise the 
teachings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Comparing the 
views of Ricardo and Carey on rent and wages, Marx stressed that 
Carey's attacks on English political economy in the person of 
Ricardo expressed only Carey's desire to gloss over the contradic­
tions of capitalist production or to prove the possibility of 
abolishing those contradictions while preserving the foundations of 
bourgeois society. 
Revealing the groundlessness of Carey's claims about the 
harmony and co-operation of the classes in American society, Marx 
wrote: 'It is par trop [altogether too] naive to suggest that, 
if the  total  product of  labour  rises, the three classes among whom it is to 
be shared will share equally in that growth. If profit were to rise by 
20%,  the workers would have to strike to obtain a 2% rise in  WAGES'  (p. 
384). 

=====第23页=====
Preface XXV 
Marx's critique of Carey's views in his letters was published by 
Cluss as an article ('The "Best Paper in the Union" and Its "Best 
Men" and Political Economists') in the newspaper Die Reform (see 
present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 623-32). It thus became available to a 
certain section of the American readership. This material of 
1852-53 subsequently served Marx as the basis for a more 
substantial critique of Carey's views and vulgar bourgeois political 
economy in the Economic Manuscripts of 1857-1858 and in Capital. 
Marx invariably passed on to Engels the results of his economic 
research. Their letters show how closely they followed the 
economic development of the European countries and America, 
and how carefully they analysed the statistical material confirming 
the antagonistic and cyclic nature of capitalist production's 
development. The elaboration of the problem of crises was of 
special interest to them, since they associated a new revolutionary 
upsurge with the end of the prosperous phase and with an 
inevitable economic decline (see Engels' letter to Marx about this 
on 24 August 1852 and Marx's letter to Lassalle of 23 January 
1855). 
From the analysis mainly of English trade and industry, they 
detected the symptoms of an imminent and inevitable economic 
crisis which could, under prevailing conditions, serve as a powerful 
stimulus to the revolutionary movement in Europe (see Engels to 
Weydemeyer on 27 February 1852, Marx to Engels on 29 
January 1853, Engels to Weydemeyer on 12 April 1853, Marx to 
Cluss on 15 September 1853, and Engels to Marx on 29 
September 1853). 
Marx and Engels paid great attention to the problems of history. 
They were stimulated to take up historical research by the desire 
for a deeper understanding of the processes of social develop­
ment, especially during the capitalist period, and in order to 
comprehend the historical factors behind the events and 
phenomena of their own times. This was important for the 
development of the correct revolutionary tactics. The letters in the 
present volume give an idea not only of the range of historical 
subjects in which Marx and Engels were interested, but of their 
conclusions and generalisations. 
The study of world history enabled Marx and Engels to 
elucidate certain characteristics in the development of capitalism 
and also of precapitalist social-economic formations. Thus, dealing 
with the history of Ancient Rome, Marx disclosed the material 
causes of the class struggle in ancient society. In his letter to 
Engels of 8 March 1855, he wrote: 'Internal history resolves itself

PLAINLY into the struggle between small and large landed property, 
specifically modified, of course, by slavery relations' (p. 527). In his 
letter to Engels of 27 July 1854, analysing the distinguished French 
historian Thierry's Essai sur l'histoire de la formation et du progrès du 
tiers état he traces how the elements of the future capitalist system 
emerged and developed in the bowels of feudalism, and he notes the 
part played by the struggle of the Third Estate against the feudal 
aristocracy during the period of transition from feudalism to 
capitalism. While acknowledging Thierry's merits, Marx points out 
the limitations of his views, and his inability to understand the 
material roots of class contradictions or the nature and character of 
class antagonisms under capitalism. 'Had Mr Thierry read our  stuff, 
he would know that the decisive opposition between bourgeoisie and 
peuple does not, of course, crystallise until the former ceases, as 
tiers-état, to oppose the clergé and the noblesse'(p. 474). This letter of 
Marx's is of fundamental importance for pinpointing the general 
methodological shortcomings in the views common to French 
bourgeois historians during the Restoration and to bourgeois 
historiographers in general. 
The letter also contains an important formulation on the 
decisive significance of the alliance between the bourgeoisie and 
the peasantry in the struggle against feudalism. Lenin laid special 
emphasis on this idea of Marx's:'The French bourgeoisie won when 
it decided to go with the peasants' ('Conspectus of "The 
Correspondence of K. Marx and F. Engels. 1844-1883'", Moscow, 
1968,  Russian edition, p. 7). 
In connection with the revolutionary events in Spain in 1854, 
Marx studied the history of the revolutionary movement of the 
Spanish people in order to 'discover exactly the springs behind 
developments' (p. 480). 
On the eve of the Crimean War, when inter-state contradictions 
became suddenly prominent in Asia Minor and the Balkans, Marx 
and Engels devoted special attention to analysing the history of 
Turkey, Persia and the countries of the Arabian peninsula, especially 
their social and political development, the role of communal 
landownership, their way of life, culture and religious trends (see 
Engels to Marx on about 26 May, Marx to Engels on 2 and 14 June, 
and Engels to Marx on 6 June 1853). These letters illustrate the 
formation of Marx's and Engels' materialist interpretation of 
religious movements in the East, showing their connection with the 
material conditions of life as a result of the transition from the 
nomadic to the settled life, the changes in trade routes, and so on. 
The letters in this volume also show the special attention Marx

Preface XXVII 
devoted at this time to India, then Great Britain's most important 
imperial possession. 
Studying the history of these countries enabled Marx and Engels 
to bring out the salient characteristics of their social development. 
'The absence of landed property is indeed the key to the whole of 
the East. Therein lies its political and religious history,' remarked 
Engels in a letter to Marx of 6 June 1853 (p. 339). In the same 
letter, he disclosed the reasons for the weak development of 
private landownership in all the Eastern countries, especially 
during the Middle Ages: the natural conditions in these countries 
necessitated the building and maintenance of irrigation works, and 
this was only possible within the scope of the central authority. 'In 
the East, the government has always consisted of 3 departments 
only: Finance (pillage at home), War (pillage at home and abroad), 
and travaux publics [public works], provision for reproduction' 
(p. 339). Marx used this idea and developed it in his article 'The 
British Rule in India' (see present edition, Vol. 12). The 
concentration of considerable means of production in the hands of 
despotic governments, the closed and isolated position of the village 
commune, the chief economic and social unit of Asiatic societies— 
these, concluded Marx and Engels, were behind the more retarded 
historical development of the Eastern countries when the transition 
from feudalism to capitalism was being accomplished in the 
West. 
Marx and Engels sharply denounced England's system of 
colonial domination in India, underlining its destructive conse­
quences. By preserving the worst features of Eastern despotism in 
the conquered countries, the English had ceased to worry about 
maintaining irrigation, as a result of which, Engels pointed out, 
'Indian agriculture is going to wrack and ruin' (p. 340). 
The process by which the colonial and dependent countries 
were drawn into the orbit of world capitalism led Marx and Engels 
to the conclusion that there was a deep mutual relationship and 
mutual dependence between the destiny of the capitalist countries 
and that of the colonial world. They became increasingly 
convinced that the proletarian movement in the metropolitan 
countries could find its own natural ally in the maturing national 
liberation movement. 
During these years, Engels' gifts as military theoretician of the 
proletarian party came to the fore. He gave great attention to the 
history of the revolutionary wars of 1848-49, intending to write a 
book on the subject. 'I should like to have time before the next 
revolution,' he wrote to Weydemeyer on 12 April 1853, 'to study and

describe thoroughly at least the campaigns of 1848 and 1849 in Italy 
and Hungary' (p. 309). He did not carry out this intention, and this 
gives all the more significance to his letters to Marx of 6 July 1852, 10 
June 1854, and a number of others in which he gives a critical 
analysis of the military operations of the revolutionary armies in 
1848 and 1849. A number of letters contain fundamental 
observations by Engels on military and military-historical science and 
its theoreticians, Clausewitz, Napier, Jomini, Willisen, and about the 
generalship of Napoleon, Wellington and others. Engels outlined his 
approach to the analysis of military operations and military science in 
a letter to the editor of The Daily  News,  30 March 1854. His extensive 
knowledge of military history and his use of dialectical materialist 
methodology were demonstrated in his articles for the New-York 
Daily Tribune during the Crimean War. 'Your military articles,' 
wrote Marx to Engels on 5 January 1854, 'have created a great stir. A 
rumour is circulating in New York that they were written by General 
Scott' (p. 407). 
Philological studies were always among the scientific interests 
pursued by Marx and Engels. During these years Marx studied 
Spanish, reading Calderon and Cervantes in the original. Engels 
studied the Slavonic (including Russian) and Oriental languages, 
especially Persian, showing outstanding linguistic abilities. Of 
considerable interest is Engels' outline of the principles of 
translation when he was analysing a translation of the first chapter 
of Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte done from 
German into English by Wilhelm Pieper (see Engels' letter to Marx 
of 23 September 1852). 
The period from 1852 to 1855 was one of intensive political 
journalism on the part of Marx and Engels. Their articles provide 
rich and often witty insights into and valuable analyses of the 
capitalist world of their times. Their journalistic activity was closely 
bound up with their theoretical studies. Research helped them to 
understand the underlying causes of current events, and important 
theoretical generalisations frequently emerged from articles on 
specific subjects. This mutual interaction of the various sides of 
their work is clearly reflected in their correspondence. 
A recurrent idea in the letters of Marx and Engels is that of the 
necessity for using any opportunity during the years of reaction to 
promote the revolutionary point of view on the most important 
political questions in order to influence public opinion in the 
interests of the working class. 'We are not doing our enemies a 
favour by writting for them. Tout au contraire [Quite the contrary].

Preface XXIX 
We could hardly play them a worse trick..." wrote Marx to Cluss 
on 14 June 1853 (p. 350). 
Marx and Engels, who began contributing to the New-York Daily 
Tribune in 1851, continued writing for it in 1852-55. Marx was the 
official correspondent for the newspaper, but many articles were 
written at Marx's request by Engels. At first, as can be seen from the 
letters in this volume, Marx wrote his articles in German and sent 
them to Engels in Manchester for translation. In January 1853, 
Marx himself began writing in English. This enabled him to keep 
his work as correspondent very much up-to-date. From 1853 to 
1855,  Marx sent to New York nearly every week or twice weekly 
his own or Engels' articles, devoted to the most topical and varied 
problems of the time. 
The articles by Marx and Engels for this bourgeois newspaper 
are a model combination of sober analysis and high principles. 
Frequently, Marx and Engels even managed to publicise ideas 
opposed to the views of the newspaper's editors (see Marx's letters 
to Engels about this on 14 June 1853 and 3 May 1854). The 
articles aroused great interest among the reading public and 
Marx's services were frequently acknowledged by the newspaper 
itself (see, for example, Marx's letter to Engels of 26 April 1853). 
However, writing for this newspaper, for all its progressiveness, 
was not easy. The editors treated the articles with scant ceremony, 
arbitrary interpolations were frequently allowed, and many articles 
were printed as unsigned leaders. Marx wrote to Engels on 14 
December 1853: 'Needless to say, the Tribune is making a great 
splash with your articles, POOR Dana, no doubt, being regarded as 
their author. At the same time they have appropriated "Palmerston" 
[Marx's work 'Lord Palmerston'], which means that, for 8 weeks past, 
Marx-Engels have virtually constituted the EDITORIAL STAFF of the 
Tribune' (see this volume, p. 404). Marx frequently protested against 
these irregularities (see Marx to Engels on 2 November 1853, 
5 January, and 22 April 1854). 
From the end of December 1854, a great deal of Marx's 
journalistic writing went on contributions to the German Neue 
Oder-Zeitung, one of the few German opposition papers to 
continue appearing during the years of the reaction. The 
invitation to contribute to this newspaper gave Marx and Engels 
the chance of direct contact with the German public, including the 
proletarian readership. A description of the Neue Oder-Zeitung is 
contained in Marx's letter to Moritz Eisner, the editor, on 11 
September 1855: 'Considering the difficult circumstances and the 
limited space at your disposal, your paper is, in my opinion, edited

with great skill and tact, and in such a way that the intelligent 
reader may read between the lines' (p. 553). 
The letters show the extent of Marx's and Engels' creative 
rapport and day-to-day collaboration. For instance, the details on 
the activities of the Aberdeen coalition cabinet as given in Marx's 
letter to Engels of 31 January 1855, were used by Engels for his 
article 'The Late British Government' (see present edition, 
Vol. 13). They often edited each other's articles. Engels frequently 
wrote dispatches instead of Marx, who was busy with urgent party 
matters (for instance, during the period of the Cologne trial) or 
was unable to work owing to illness or domestic problems. 
In their letters, Marx and Engels paid much attention to 
England's economic and political position, to describing the 
various classes of English society and to the struggle of the 
political parties. Acknowledging that the English political system 
was at that time more progressive than those of other European 
countries, Marx nevertheless unmasked the myth of England as a 
bulwark of constitutional freedoms and civic equality. He tried to 
show the real class nature of the English constitutional monar­
chy—the oligarchic domination, tricked out in parliamentary 
forms,  of the landed aristocracy and the bourgeoisie. In a series of 
letters, Marx stressed the anti-democratic nature of the English 
electoral system, which deprived the majority of the people of 
voting rights (see, for example, Marx's letter to Cluss of 20 July 
1852). 
As far back as 1852, Marx had detected signs of crisis in the 
English oligarchic system of government—a system which helped 
the ruling classes give their domination the semblance of free 
rivalry between two political parties, the Whigs and the Tories. 
From the formation of the Aberdeen coalition government at the 
end of 1852 until its fall in 1855, Marx and Engels observed the 
disintegration of these old bourgeois-aristocratic parties of the 
ruling oligarchy. Marx's letter to Cluss on 20 July 1852 and one 
from Engels to Weydemeyer on 12 April 1853 developed the idea 
that the reform of the state system had become urgently necessary 
and that the crisis of the existing political parties could be 
overcome only 'from without by the pressure of the masses' and 
that it would 'no longer be possible to govern England without 
considerably extending the pays légal [franchise]' (pp. 136 and 
306-07). In this way, Marx and Engels drew attention to the fact that 
the English working class, despite the decline of its political 
activities in the first half of the 1850s in comparison with the 
period of Chartism at its height, was stepping into the arena of the

country's political life as a force without whose participation no 
progressive changes would be possible. 
Marx and Engels showed great interest in the economic and 
political development of France because they set great store by the 
revolutionary traditions of the French people and the French 
working class and did not lose their faith in its vigour and 
heroism. They foresaw the dangerous consequences for the 
French and for the whole European proletariat in the consolida­
tion of the Bonapartist dictatorship. The letters disclose the 
essence of the anti-popular regime of the Second Empire and note 
the most characteristic feature of Bonapartism—the combination 
of the traditional policy of crude police and military terror 
towards the oppressed classes with broad demagogy in social and 
national questions both in home and foreign policy. The 
correspondence gives a vivid picture of the stock exchange 
machinations and speculative ventures of the bourgeoisie during 
the Second Empire, the corruption and adventurism in the 
country's economic life as well as in government circles. In 1853, 
Marx and Engels had already predicted a short life for French 
industrial 'prosperity', stressing that the government's policy would 
inevitably plunge the French economy into chaos. They noted with 
delight the awakening dissatisfaction with the Bonapartist regime 
on the part of the broad masses and forecast the inevitable 
collapse of Napoleon Ill's empire (see Engels to Weydemeyer on 
12 April and to Marx on 26 April 1853; Marx to Engels on 
12 October 1853 and to Eisner on 8 November 1855). 
The main power which was destined to play a decisive role in 
the struggle with the Bonapartist regime was, in the opinion of 
Marx and Engels, the French proletariat. 'So you can see,' wrote 
Marx to Cluss on 25 March 1853, 'that the proletarian lion isn't 
dead'—thus drawing attention to the mass anti-Bonapartist de­
monstration at the funeral of Madame Raspail, wife of the famous 
revolutionary (this volume, p. 300). At the same time, they also bore 
in mind the demoralising influence on the workers of Bonapartism's 
social demagogy. 'They will have to be severely chastened by crises if 
they are to be good for anything again  soon,'  wrote Engels to Marx on 
24 September 1852 (pp. 196-97). 
As a result of the preparations for and outbreak of the Crimean 
War, there was a considerable widening of the range of questions 
with which Marx and Engels were concerned. Above all, they 
became aware of the need to study seriously the foreign policy of 
the ruling classes. Marx wrote to Engels on 2 November 1853: 'I 
am glad that chance should have led me to take a closer look at

XXXIV Preface 
1853 and 18 May 1855). It was very much under the influence of 
Herzen's books that Marx and Engels arrived at the opinion that 
internal contradictions in Russia were growing and resistance to the 
Tsarist regime was stiffening in that country. On 12 April 1853, 
Engels wrote to Weydemeyer that should a European revolutionary 
war break out against Tsarism, 'an aristocratic-bourgeois revolution 
in Petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior is a possibility' 
(pp. 305-06). The letters also contain a number of critical comments 
on Herzen's conception of 'Russian socialism', which was based on 
the Utopian idea of the 'rejuvenation' of Europe by means of the 
Russian peasant commune (see, for instance, this volume, p. 523). 
At the same time, Marx and Engels clarified their position 
concerning the plans of certain circles of the Polish emigration to 
wrest Byelorussian and Ukrainian lands from Russia. The 
above-mentioned letter by Engels to Weydemeyer contains the 
following: 'As to the former Polish provinces on this side of the 
Dvina and Dnieper, I want to hear nothing more of them, 
knowing as I do that the peasants there are all Ukrainians, only 
the aristocracy and some of the people in the towns being Polish, and 
that to the peasant there ... the restoration of Poland is synonymous 
with the restoration of the old ruling aristocracy, its powers 
unimpaired' (p. 306). 
The period 1852-55 was one of the most difficult in the lives of 
Marx and Engels, and their letters to each other clearly show how 
they were helped to survive their tribulations by the friendship 
which they maintained throughout their lives. This was expressed 
very touchingly by Marx at a moment of great personal loss: 
'Amid all the fearful torments I have recently had to endure, the 
thought of you and your friendship has always sustained me, as 
has the hope that there is still something sensible for us to do 
together in the world' (p. 533).

Volume 39 contains, printed in chronological order, 293 letters 
written by Marx and Engels from 1852 to 1855. By no means all 
their letters have been preserved, in particular, Engels' letters for 
1855,  of which only one survives. The letters were written mainly 
in German, apart from three in English. Twelve were written in 
two languages—German and English, German and French, and 
German and Italian. The overwhelming majority are being 
published in English for the first time. Only 43 letters (of which 39

Preface XXXV 
in incomplete form) have been published before in English. All 
these publications are indicated in the notes. The text of former 
English publications has been checked and improved where 
necessary. 
The Appendices contain letters written by Jenny Marx on her 
husband's instructions, and also extracts from the letters of Cluss 
to Weydemeyer giving the contents of a number of letters from 
Marx to Cluss which have not come down to us. Most of the 
material in the Appendices is also being published in English for 
the first time. 
In the course of work on this volume, the earlier dating of 
certain letters has been corrected. The letter from Marx to Cluss 
of 3 September 1852, previously published as a single document, 
has been divided in this volume into two, dated 3 September and 
[after 5 September] 1852. 
Study of the correspondence for 1852-55 has made it possible to 
attribute certain articles to Marx and Engels, and also to date the 
writing of certain already known articles of that period more 
accurately. All such attributions and details of dates are mentioned 
in the notes. 
The authors' own contraction of proper and geographical names 
and of certain words have been reproduced vh full. Obvious errors 
and inaccuracies have been corrected. Defects in the manuscripts, 
when the text is missing or illegible, are indicated by three dots in 
square brackets. If the context allows a presumable reconstruction 
to be made of the missing or illegible words, these words are also 
in square brackets. Passages struck out by the authors have, as a 
rule,  not been reproduced, except where they represent variant 
readings which are given in the footnotes. 
Foreign words and expressions have been retained in the 
original language and are given in italics; if they were underlined 
by the authors they are set in spaced italics. 
In the letters written in German, words used by Marx and 
Engels in English are printed in small caps. Longer passages 
written in English in the original are placed in asterisks. If a fact 
or event is referred to in several letters, the same note number is 
used every time. 
The volume was compiled, the texts of the letters and

relevant notes written by Velta Pospelova; the texts of the letters

been interrupted not only by events coming one on top of another 
but to an even greater extent by private affairs. Henceforward, I

Lupusb has fallen seriously ill and hence has not yet been able 
to send anything. Red Wolff'sc article seemed to me unusable, 
hence I did not send it  off. 3 
If, which I hope will not happen, your undertakingd has to be 
postponed for any length of time on financial grounds, let Dana 
have the article so that he may translate it into English for his 
paper.4 However, I hope this will not be necessary. 
Give Dana my regards. Tell him I have received his newspapers 
and his letter and shall be sending him a new WORK next week.5 
As for the Revues,e since they are not ready to hand but have to 
be obtained at some expense and trouble from Hamburg, please 
let me know roughly how many sales you think I can count on in 
America.6 
I shall be sending you from here Notes to the People by our

Dear Marx, 
BY THIS TIME, you will, I trust, have completely recovered from 
your afflictions; I also hope that your wife will no longer be angry 
with me about the coup d'état which plunged you for two days 
into such depths of melancholy. 7 At any rate, please give her and 
your children my kindest regards. 
I shall get an article done for Weydemeyer in time for next 
Friday's steamer and hope you will let me have something topical 
for the Tribune, which I shall at once translate. It's really not a 
paper that calls for any serious exertion. Barnum stalks its 
columns large as life, and the English is ghastly—but this apart, it 
has some good qualities which, however, have nothing at all to do 
with our  UNE. If you can see that it reaches me by Thursday— 
even by the 2nd post—you shall have the translation back in 
London in time for Saturday's steamer, i.e. by the 2nd post 
arriving there on Friday. Then, next week, I shall set to work on 
the articles on Germany and shall soon be done with them. b

Counter-Revolution in Germany.

The lack of originality with which the Austrians have aped Louis 
Napoleon and promptly abolished their constitution is certainly 
deplorable. Now there'll be a fine how-d'ye-do in Prussia— 
there's no doubt that Prussia has been betrayed and sold by 
Austria and, if it does not likewise abolish its constitution,8 may 
very well be crushed by a Russian-Austrian-French alliance. 
In 1851 the English cotton industry consumed 32,000 bales a 
week as against 29,000 bales in 1850.a The entire surplus, and a 
good deal more, went to the East Indies and China; at present 
Manchester is almost wholly dependent on deliveries to these two 
markets and to the HOME TRADE, since very little is going to the 
Continent. This cannot last much longer. They are sailing very 
near the wind here, and the fact that, e.g., cotton prices are 
soaring, despite an exceptionally heavy crop, merely in the 
expectation of even heavier demand, is of itself significant enough. 
Weerth dropped me a few lines today from Bradford inquiring 
about the insufferable Lüders who has written to him. If you can 
tell me whether and to what extent this old jackass has been 
involved in the intrigues there, I should be grateful and it might 
come in handy. Otherwise, nothing else to report,  BUSINESS  WITH US

had to keep amused for a whole week, certainly no light task here 
in Manchester. There could, of course, be no question of work 
during that time, and only now can I turn my mind to what may 
be done before next Friday's STEAMER. At all events, either this 
evening or tomorrow evening something will be ready for the 
Tribune, nor will Father Weydemeyer go empty-handed. In the 
meantime I have heard and seen nothing from the latter—I hope 
that today will have brought you a letter from him telling us about 
the prospects for the New Year, since the letters that arrived by 
yesterday's STEAMER were dated up to 1 January. 
I trust that in the meantime the paterfamilias3  will have arisen 
from his bed of pain and penance, and only hope that the Library 
will not entirely drive the Tribune from his mind. The information 
about the honourable Lüders was conveyed forthwith to Weerth, 
likewise as much as was necessary concerning the worthy Kinkel. 
The lambastings received by the great Willich are most pleasing 
so far as we are concerned, while for him there would appear to 
be an excellent prospect of repeated applications. Once the spell of 
inviolability and invincibility cast around himself by the great war­
rior has been broken by a bonne volée, c not one blackguard of an 
émigré, right down to the last Conrad, 9 will rest until he has repeat­
ed the experiment and wreaked upon the noble fellow tangible 
vengeance for his private GRIEVANCES. The great man's courage 
malheureuxd may then console itself with the thought that those who 
did the thrashing were all of them 'men of principle'. Thrashings 
he may have had, but they were 'principled thrashings'. 
I return Cluss' letter herewith." As an agent, the fellow's 
beyond compare. When the business of Willich's mystification10 
comes out, there'll be a fine how-d'ye-do! The philistines will no 
longer dare to write letters for fear of their falling into our hands. 
How scurrilously hypocritical it was on Kinkel's part to maintain 
that he had written to London, telling them to get in touch with 
us! This fact only goes to show that he has been constantly and 
most disagreeably 'challenged' on our account in America and 
that, among the democratic rabble there, we too have a SET of 
adherents who swear by us, as do the others by Kinkel or Heinzen 
or Hecker, heaven knows why; these must be adherents à la 
Magnus Gross, Wilhelmi, etc., people who would only have to 
spend a short time in our company to be better informed both 
about us and themselves, and to return to the common fold where 
they belong.

I must say, Louis Napoleon grows daily more amusing. While 
not a single one of those great measures for the abolition of 
pauperism, etc., has yet managed to see the light of day, the little 
fellow contrives to provoke all philistines in the world by measures 
which are merely intended to ensure a temporary consolidation of 
his authority.11  No longer does any non-French paper dare speak 
up for him, even the Sun and the Kölnische remain silent, and 
only the good-for-nothing correspondent of the Globe continues to 
deposit his daily scurrilities in the corner allotted to him for the 
purpose. On top of that, Louis Napoleon has aroused universal 
suspicion, the whole of Europe resounds with war and rumours of 
war, 3 and even the peaceable Daily News has nolens volens0 to join 
in the call for  NATIONAL  DEFENCES.  Along with the side of his character 
which has been most in evidence since 2 December—the 
GAMBLER—the  fellow is gradually beginning to develop another, that 
of the mad pretender who regards himself as a predestined world 
redeemer and who swears by his star. And when the time was 
come, God sent the nephew that he might redeem the world from 
the bondage of the devil and from the hell of socialism. Luckily 
parliament will be meeting shortly, which always introduces a little 
variety into the humbug of politics.

serious one. Hence, even with the best will in the world, I could 
not send you No. Ill of my article on Bonaparte" this week. 
Instead, you will find enclosed a poem1S  and a personal letter 
from Freiligrath. I beseech you now to: 1. See that the poem is 
carefully printed, with adequate intervals between the verses and 
allowing plenty of space for the whole. A great deal is lost if 
poems are too closely printed and over-compressed. 2. Write 
Freiligrath a friendly letter. Nor need you be over-fearful of 
paying him compliments, for poets, even the best of them, are all 
plus au moins des courtisanes b and il faut les cajoler, pour les faire 
chanter." In private life our Freiligrath is the most amiable, least 
pretentious of men who conceals beneath a genuine bonhomie un 
esprit très fin et très railleur 6 and whose passion is 'authentic', yet 
does not render him either 'uncritical' or 'superstitious'. He is a 
true revolutionary and a man of honour to the marrow, a 
compliment I would pay to only a very few. Nevertheless a poet, 
whatever he may be as an homme, c needs applause and ADMIRATION. 
This is, I believe, peculiar to the genre as such. I am only telling 
you all this to remind you not to lose sight, when corresponding 
with Freiligrath, of the distinction between the 'poet' and the 
'critic'.  It is, by the by, very nice of him to address his poetical 
letter directly to you. I think that this will be helpful to you in 
New York. 
I do not know whether I shall manage to send you another 
article today. Pieper had promised me to write an article for you. 
Up till this moment he has not yet turned up and when he does, 
the article will have, to be put to the test—i.e. whether it is 
consigned to the flames, or is considered worthy of crossing the 
ocean. I am trop faible encore 1 to go on writing. More today week.

Dear Engels, 
Only since yesterday have I been up and about again and it was 
not until today that I again took up my pen. 
Since I was unable to go out and visit Chapman as I had 
planned, Pieper, with the enthusiasm he habitually displays in the 
first ten minutes, offered to discount the bill for me. The other 
evening he brought me the money, only to declare that he would 
send you the bill so that you could have it discounted in 
Manchester. I, as well as my wife, told him that we knew you 
couldn't do so. But he had already written his letter and, since he 
made it pretty clear that I appeared, for reasons of my own, to be 
putting obstacles in his way, I gave him his head and be damned 
to it, feeling sure that you would return the stuff to him. Now, 
when he informs me of this fait? it turns out that he was not in 
such a hurry after all, but was merely seeking to give himself airs. 
For me, it was a nasty business, since you might have thought I 
had been guilty of an indiscretion.

may come up to London in a week or a fortnight's time since, out 
of sheer impatience, he is once again champing at the bit. 
The Pacific having arrived from New York yesterday, there's a 
chance that tomorrow might bring the numbers3 promised me by 
Weydemeyer—but I am not counting on this since he may have 
waited for the regular English  MAIL  STEAMER. By the way, he should 
not send so many, 50 copies is too much and will probably cost a 
mint of money, and who are they all to be sent to? I will find out 
what the charges are and if needs be—that is, if he can't arrange 
the business more cheaply through parcels consignment agen­
cies—10 copies would be quite sufficient; for he cannot after all 
count on subscribers in Europe. A few in London, perhaps; 
otherwise maybe only in Hamburg. And that would also call for an 
agency, which would not pay for  itself. 
I trust you'll soon be sending me an article to translate for the 
Tribune. 
Jones has written to me asking for contributions. I shall do my 
best and have given him my word.19 All this means that any spare 
time I might have for swotting is frittered away piecemeal, and 
that's bad. I must see how I can arrange things and diddle the 
office. Jones mentions a dirty trick Harney played on him20 and 
says he was cheated out of £15, concerning which you would be 
able to tell me more—what is all this? He was, of course,  VERY  BUSY 
and his letter consists largely of unfinished sentences and 
exclamation marks. 
As to Pieper's  DODGE  in the matter of the bill, the whole 
stratagem was, of course, perfectly plain to me, and Monsieur le bel 
homme h will have realised that he needs rather more cunning to 
conjure eight pounds out of my pocket. Being well aware how he 
stood financially on 2 January, I chaffed him about his supposed 
shortage of money, warned him against dishonest and unsound 
bill-brokers in London, declared that the bill must be dispatched 
as quickly as possible, and finally advised him to have it cashed 
through Weydemeyer—in which case, it would again pass through 
your hands and, upon the arrival of the notification of payment, 
which would, of course, come to you or me, it would quite 
spontaneously give rise to a further discounting transaction with 
this youthful trading house. I owe him 2 pounds, for which he 
also asked; this I also promised to repay, but not before the 
beginning of February.

probably pick a quarrel with England. This would have its good 
and its bad aspects. The French notion that they could conquer 
London and England in 5 hours is a very harmless one. But what 
they can do now, is carry out sudden raids with 20, or at the most 
30 thousand men, which, however, would nowhere be very 
effective. Brighton is the one town seriously threatened; South­
ampton, etc., are safeguarded, not so much by fortifications as by 
their situation on deep inlets navigable only at high tide and with 
the help of local pilots. The greatest EFEECT a French landing could 
hope to achieve would be the destruction of Woolwich, but even 
then they would have to take damned good care not to advance on 
London. In the case of any serious invasion, the combined forces 
of the Continent would inevitably give the English at least  A YEARS 
NOTICE, whereas 6 months would suffice to place England in a state 
of readiness against any attack. The present alarums are being 
deliberately exaggerated—with the greatest help from the Whigs. 
All the English have to do to safeguard themselves for the time 
being is to recall a dozen ships of the line and STEAMERS, fit out 
another dozen of both kinds which are lying in port half 
completed, recruit 25,000 more troops, organise volunteer rifle 
battalions equipped with Minié rifles and, in addition, some militia 
and some training for the YEOMANRY. But the alarums serve a very 
good purpose; the government had really excelled itself in 
allowing things to go to wrack and ruin and this will cease. And 
then, if it comes to the point, they will be so well armed that they 
will be able to repulse any attempt at a landing and at once 
retaliate. 
Otherwise, so far as I can see, there are only 2 prospects open 
to Louis Napoleon if he wants to start a war: 1. against Austria, 
i.e. against the entire Holy Alliance, or 2. against Prussia, if the 
latter is dropped by Russia and Austria. However, the second is 
very doubtful and, as for his picking a quarrel with the Holy 
Alliance, this is most questionable. Neither England nor the Holy 
Alliance will abandon Piedmont, Switzerland and Belgium to him. 
The business is becoming so prettily entangled that in the end 
pure chance must decide. 
And à l'intérieur, what splendid goings-on! Attempted assassina­
tions almost a daily occurrence and the measures taken ever 
prettier. If only Mr de Morny, who still to some degree plays a 
virtuous hero, were at last thrown out, and if only the noble one 3 
were to confiscate the property of the Orleans.2

MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 
IN NEW YORK 
[London,] 23 January 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
Unfortunately my indisposition has up till now prevented me 
from writing to you this week, i.e. for your paper.3 With much 
effort I concocted an article for Dana,b who had received nothing 
from me for six weeks or more. For years, nothing has so pulled 
me down as this damned haemorrhoidal complaint, not even the 
last French fiasco.0  Enfin, 6 I shall be all the better for having been 
forcibly kept away from the library e for 4 weeks, hard though this 
was. 
You will be getting two more articles about the 18th Brumaire/ 
of which the first will be dispatched, come what may, on Friday 
next and the other immediately afterwards, if not at the same 
time. 
Enclosed Pieper's article.22 
As for Lupus, I have been chivvying him a great deal and he 
seems to have made up his mind to take a retrospective look at 
Kossuth's Hungarian carrière 9 for your paper. You have made two 
mistakes, first in failing to name Lupus along with ourselves in 
your announcement, 28 and secondly in not approaching him direct 
Make good the second with a letter which you may enclose in one

to myself and in which you urge him to write. No one else among 
us all has his popular style. He is extrêmement  modeste.  All the more 
must one avoid giving the impression that his cooperation is 
regarded as superfluous. 
Because I live some distance from Freiligrath and because I 
received Pieper's article only just before the post left, we have 
today been compelled to send you two letters instead of one.' This 
will be avoided next time. 
Enclosed another statement from my friend Pfänder (Bauer no 
longer belongs to our League). You will have to publish it, since 
the Windmill Streeters' statement against him appeared in both 
the American and the European papers. 24 It would be a good idea 
if, beneath this statement, you were to print the comment that it 
contains only what could be published under present police 
conditions (the accounts between Bauer and Pfänder on the one 
hand and the former League on the other, further, the control 
exercised by the Central Authority over the administration of those 
monies, we being in the majority on the C.A.—none of these 
things can, of course, be published yet); that, counting on the 
political precautions we, for our part, have to take in Germany, 
Arnold Winkelried Ruge, b that old gossip and 'Confusius' 0 of 
European democracy, made an allusion to those matters (i.e. those 
of Pfänder and Bauer) about which he himself knew only from 
hearsay at 3rd or 4th hand, in the hope of incriminating myself 
and Engels in the eyes of the public, although the business was no 
concern of ours, d in just the same way as the jackass suggested that 
it was the Windmill Streeters who threw us out when it was we 
who had broken with that society,' as Pfänder's letter also implies. 
You might also announce that a new workers' society has been 
formed in London under Stechan's chairmanship,25 which will keep 
aloof from 'Emigration', 'Agitation'26 and Great Windmill Street 
alike, and pursue a serious line. 
Tu comprends, mon  cher,1  that this society belongs to us, although 
we only send our younger people there; I refer to our 'heducated g 
people' not to our workers. They all go there.

Stechan has about him something of the solidity of a guild 
brother and the fickleness of a small master-artisan, but he is 
educatable and has considerable influence in Northern Germany. 
That is why I have also called on him to provide contributions for 
you.a  We have  BY AND  BY pushed him into the foreground, which he 
likes to shun, and into contradiction, which he likes to gloss over. 
Willich had asked him to guarantee Kinkel's loan 27 but he refused. 
At first enthusiastically welcomed by Schapper and Willich, and set 
against us by them, he was soon enabled by his better nature to 
see through the shabbiness and hollowness of these fellows and 
their following. And so (with a little help from Lochner and other 
assistants with whom we had provided him incognito) he openly 
broke with the rabble. 
Is A. Hentze our Hentze from Hamm? If so, I would write to 
him, for as it is Willich has done everything to blacken me in his 
eyes.  L'infâme! b

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 12 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 23 January 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
I hope that in the meantime you will have received my first 
letter, which I posted on 18 or 19 December in time for the 
STEAMER Africa.0 It contained an article written in haste and a letter, 
a See this volume, pp. 19-20. - b The scoundrel! - c Notes to the  People  - d This 
letter has not been found.

likewise written in haste. You should have had it long before the 
5th, but it may have only gone with the next STEAMER. Meanwhile, 
last week I sent you by the Niagara an article unaccompanied by a 
letter,29  but doubt whether I posted it in time; if it was too late, it 
will arrive with this one, by the Europa, in which case you will have 
some material in hand. You'll have already had several things 
from Marx, an anti-Kinkel poem from Freiligrath 3 and also, 
perhaps, something from Lupus and Pieper. Weerth is very busy 
just now and has not really settled down in Bradford (Yorkshire); 
however, he has promised me he will send something by the next 
STEAMER. I shall probably see him here tomorrow and prod him yet 
again to make him keep his promise. Unfortunately Marx has 
been seriously ill for the past fortnight as a result of an almighty 
binge when I was in London over the New Year, and I was 
prevented from working until last week, partly because of the 
fortnight spent in London and partly because of various snags that 
subsequently cropped up. However, I think I shall be able to send 
you something regularly each week now, and shortly, perhaps, 
something for a feuilleton by way of a change. 
I am setded here in Manchester for the present, luckily in a 
position which, besides much independence, affords me various 
advantages; Marx and other friends occasionally come up from 
London to see me and, so long as Weerth is in Bradford, we 
arrange a regular shuttle-service between here and there, as the 
railway journey only takes 2  V2 hours. But now he will probably 
leave; he cannot abide that beastly hole, Bradford, and he's never 
happy anywhere if he has to spend more than a year sitting on his 
backside in the same place. I am considering a trip to the STATES, 
either next summer or, if there are no political changes in the 
meantime, the summer after that; to the STATES, New York, and 
particularly New Orleans. But this depends on my old man,b not 
me, and also on how things go in the cotton market. 
Fifty copies of the Revolution is too much and the cost will 
probably be enormous, i.e. four shillings or more each time. In 
view of the wholesale arrests, dispersion, etc., and the German 
press laws, we can count on only a few subscribers here and, in 
Germany, only one or two at most in Hamburg, hence specimen 
numbers will be of no use to us. Newspapers, one or more to a 
wrapper, open at the sides, cost Id (2 cents) per sheet. So send 4 
to me and 6-8 direct to London, for otherwise I have to restamp

them from here to London and I can hardly saddle the business 
with these massive postal charges. Ten to twelve copies will suffice 
for us and, if there seems to be any prospect of subscribers here, 
we can organise a regular agency in London to which the back 
numbers can be sent all at one time and under the same cover to 
complete the series. I shall discuss the matter with the people in 
London and see what can be done. 
In France, things are going splendidly. Yesterday evening the 
Patrie reported that the creation of a Police Ministry for de 
Maupas would be announced in today's Moniteur. 1' De Morny who, 
along with Fould and a few others, represents the material 
interests of the bourgeoisie (but not their participation in political 
power) in the Cabinet, will be thrown out, and the reign of those 
died-in-the-wool adventurers Maupas, Persigny and Co. will begin. 
That will be the start of imperial true socialism 30; the first socialist 
measure will be the confiscation of Louis Philippe's property,b  for 
the Act of 6 August 1830, by which he left his property to his 
children instead of to the State as ancient custom demanded, is 
invalid. The portion of the Condé estates inherited by Aumale is 
also to be seized. The news might even arrive by next 
Saturday's STEAMER if things develop quickly enough. In the 
southern départements, the insurgents are still being hunted like 
game. 31 
The English Press is now the only reliable one for French news, 
and occasionally too, the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung. The paper 
in which you will find the best news about France is the London 
Daily News, which I therefore specially commend to you. The 
Tribune takes it, and you will certainly also be able to lay hands on 
it elsewhere, it being far too expensive to take. You will, I am 
sure,  have no difficulty in finding it in the coffee houses of the 
CITY'S commercial quarter. 
Dronke may soon be paying you a visit; I hear that anyone who 
has to leave Switzerland is sent via France only to America, not to 
England. But now he will be compelled to leave; as we have heard 
nothing whatever from him he must be in hiding.

on the same ship as Heinzen, is a sterling fellow. With them went

you can get from Cluss (away in the Alleghenies), will exert 
himself on behalf of the Revolution. Please send him my kind 
regards, which may be done through Cluss. 
Below, a few supplementary notes on my remarks concerning 
the prospects for an invasion of England,32 which will explain 
things to you: 
1. Any landing west of Portsmouth runs the risk of being forced 
into the wedge formed by Cornwall—hence impracticable. 
2. Any landing too far north of, or too close to, Dover faces the 
same hazard between Thames and sea. 
3. London and Woolwich—the first buts d'opération. 3 Detach­
ments to be sent against Portsmouth and Sheerness (Chatham). 
Strong occupation force in London, strong guard posts between 
the coast and London. Out of a landing force 150,000 strong, at 
least 60,000 needed for this purpose (and that not enough). Thus 
continuation of operations could proceed with 90,000 men. 
4. Birmingham the second objective (on account of the arms 
factories). Secure the area south of the Bristol Channel and the 
Wash, i.e. a line from Gloucester to King's Lynn; in addition, a 
strong spearhead aimed at Birmingham. However weak and 
broken the opposing army might be, I consider this impossible 
with the 90,000 men available. But assuming it succeeds, no 
tenable defence position will have been won, particularly if the 
English Navy bestirs  itself.  The line will be too long and too weak. 
Hence it will be necessary to resume the advance. 
5. Manchester the third objective; all country south of Mersey 
(or Ribble) and Aire (Humber) to be secured and this line to be 
held. It is shorter and more tenable, but here again the forces 
greatly weakened by the need to detach troops. Hence, since the 
defenders still have room and resources enough to reorganise, 
either the advance must continue, or else there must be an early 
retreat. 
6. The first tenable line in the relatively narrow part of 
northern England, either the Tees or even better the Tyne (the 
line of the Roman wall against the Picts33) from Carlisle to 
Newcastle. But then the agricultural, industrial and commercial 
resources of the Scottish Lowlands still remain in the hands of the 
defenders.

7. The conquest of England proper can be regarded as complete, 
and then only for a time, only after the capture of Glasgow and 
Edinburgh, the retreat of the defenders into the Highlands, and 
the occupation of the admirably short strong line between Clyde 
and Firth of Forth, having an extensive railway system to the rear. 
Only after the conquest, however, would the difficulty, and an 
unavoidable one, be felt—that of consolidating once communica­
tions with France have been cut. 
In such circumstances, how many men are needed to conquer 
and hold the entire country from Dover to the Clyde, and to 
present a decent front on the Clyde? 
To my mind, 400,000 would not be too many. 
These CONSIDERATIONS are much too detailed for your paper and I 
lay them before you as a PROFESSIONAL  MAN.  Take a look at a map of 
England and tell me what you think. It is an aspect of the matter 
that is totally neglected by the English.

impairs the effect of the whole.38 D'abord,c  is Kinkel a 'German

poet? I and a great many other bons gens' 1 venture modestly to 
express some doubt upon this point. Then: will it not detract from 
the significant contrast between the 'German poet' and the 
'commercial' Babylon to deal yet again with the contrast between 
the 'free' and the 'servile' poet? The more so as the relationship of 
the puffed-up man of letters to the world that confronts the 'poet' 
is already depicted exhaustively in Andersen.39  Since, as I see it, 
there is no intrinsic need to bring in Kinkel at this point, your 
verse would only provide our opponents with the opportunity of 
coming down on it as the expression of personal pique or rivalry. 
But as it is so felicitous and ought not to be wasted, you will—if 
you agree with my view in other respects—certainly have a chance 
of using it in a different context, in one of the later poetical 
letters. For the sketch is delicious. 
Since Engels-Weerth have not returned the copy of your first 
poemb which I sent them, all I had to offer red  Wolff c yesterday 
were the few bits I knew by heart which, however, sufficed to 
bring on one of his fits of enthusiasm. 
Quant à notre ami d Ebner, 40 he has undoubtedly had letters from 
Pieper, the best proof being that Pieper possesses a reply from 
him. Besides, he wrote him another long letter quite recently, 
excusing my silence on the grounds of my indisposition. 
I have had a letter from Bermbach consisting of some 30 lines. 
He asks why he has not heard from me for so long. The answer is 
quite simple. I send about half a sheet to Cologne and, after a 
very long delay, receive in return a few lines, none of which ever 
answers my questions. For instance, never a word about Daniels' 
state of health and the like. You will get this letter as soon as it 
comes back from Manchester. Engels is going to use it for articles 
for the English papers.' There is nothing of importance in the 
scrawl save the following: The Board of indicting magistrates, 
remarquez le bien, 1 in view of the fact 'that there was no actual 
evidence of an indictable offence', rules that the investigation must 
start all over again. First then, on the basis of some stupid 
presumption, you have to spend 9 months in jug. Next, it 
transpires that there are no legal grounds for your being in jug. 
Conclusion: You must remain in jug until the examining 
magistrate finds himself à même 9 to present 'actual evidence of an 
indictable offence' and, if the 'actual evidence' is not forthcoming, 
in gaol you remain until you rot.

Such shameless poltroonery is unbelievable. The main fault lies 
with the wretched 'Press' which utters not a word. A few articles in 
the Kölnische Zeitung, the National-Zeitung and the Breslauer 
Zeitung —and the Cologne Board of indicting magistrates would 
never have dared do anything of the sort. But the liberals and 
democrats, like the curs they are, rejoice at the removal of their 
communist rivals. Did we not stand up for the Temmes and every 
imaginable variety of democratic riff-raff whenever they found 
themselves in conflict with the police and the courts?" Not once 
does Kinkel, for whom Becker was a hearth and Bürgers a haven, b 
render them any thanks in the Lithographische Korrespondenz which 
he sustains with American funds. Les canailles! 
If I knew of a safe bourgeois address in Cologne, I would write 
to Mrs Daniels and endeavour to reassure her to some extent 
about political conditions. From what Pieper tells me, it would 
seem that every counter-revolutionary advance is exploited by the 
'worthy citizens' to alarm and vex her.

ENGELS TO MARX

Manchester, 28 January 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Enclosed the thing for The Times!1 All you have to write is:* Sir, 
I believe the publication of the scandalous facts contained in the 
annexed letter will contribute to throw some light upon the state 
of things on the Continent. The correctness of these facts I 
guarantee,* etc. Name and address. 
Mine to The Daily News will be going off this evening by the 
second post; if you arrange matters similarly, both letters will 
arrive at the respective OFFICES at almost the same time and thus 
may appear in Friday's issue.42 But post the letter in Charing  Cross; 
there is too much delay at the branch OFFICES. 
I return herewith the two letters from Cluss and Bermbach. The 
seal on your Saturday's letter was once again in a sorry state; I 
enclose it herewith. What can be afoot? 
In The Daily News I shall simply sign myself A GERMAN MERCHANT. 
Write soon.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 29 January 1852 
Dear Marx, 
How annoying that one cannot rely on anything being done 
unless one does it  oneself.  Owing to our messenger's stupidity, my 
letter to The Daily News did not go off yesterday; now it's too late. 
So all I can do is to keep it in abeyance until I see whether yours 
is in tomorrow's or Saturday's Times. If not, it will go off at once. 
In the meantime there's one thing to consider: whether Freiligrath 
is not the right man for The D. News. Were he to write to them, I 
could try The Weekly Press and The Sun. We 2 have been 
cold-shouldered by The D. N. once already.42 
Enclosed another article for Dana.a It might, perhaps, be 
divided into two at the point where the Polish business ends— 
though it would be better to keep it entire. If you split it up, you 
can send both halves by the same STEAMER, since there is not another 
sailing before tomorrow week. I will now see that I get on fairly 
quickly,  SAY,  2 articles a week, so as to have done with the SUBJECT. 
There will be 15-16 articles in all.43 
No copiesb received from Weydemeyer. No letter either. This 
surprises me. I shall finish another article0 for him this evening. 
The French are real jackasses. Madier approached me about an 
industrial matter and, since my brother-in-law,d  who knows the 
DODGE, happened to be here, I gave him some very useful hints and 
advice. Now the dolt writes to say that, as a result of silly chatter 
by some crapaud' who knows nothing of this matter, he intends to 
go about it in a different and  MOST  UNBUSINESSLIKE way, and I am to 
obtain, not for him, but for his associate, a man whom I have 
never seen, letters of introduction from my brother-in-law (who, 
fortunately, is on the Continent)! You will recall that Madier 
introduced us to a calico printer who was bound for Manchester. 
The fellow calls on me, I go to immense pains to be helpful, do

Revolution - c  F. Engels, 'England', II. •- d Emil Blank - e philistine (literally: toad)

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 1 
IN NEW YORK 
[Manchester,] Friday, 30 January 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
I sent you by last Saturday's STEAMER (the Europa, I think) an 
article together with a letter. 3 Herewith a few more lines. The 
issues of the Revolution you promised have not yet turned up, 
although your last letter of 5 Jan. gave good reason to believe that 
they would come by the next  STEAMER,  and since then 1 Southamp­
ton and 3 Liverpool STEAMERS have arrived here with mails from 
New York dated up to 17 Jan. I hope no snags have arisen to 
prevent publication. At all events, I expect to hear from you by 
the next  STEAMER,  the Cambria (out of Boston 21 Jan.), which is due 
here on Monday 2 Feb. 
My anticipations regarding the confiscation of Louis Philippe's 
fortune and a Persigny Ministry0 have been confirmed sooner 
than I could have hoped; given a reasonably well-organised 
service, news of it must have arrived in New York by way of the 
Liverpool newspapers at the same time as my letter; hardly was 
my letter in the post when the telegraphic dispatch about it 
likewise arrived here. So much the better. The thing's going 
splendidly and there's better still to come. 
Weerth is on his travels again, will be visiting Holland, France, 
Switzerland, etc., and must at this moment be in London. I have 
written and told Marx that he should again chivvy him a little 
about sending you a few things, although he will hardly have the 
peace and quiet to do so. When one has spent the whole day 
tramping round calling on Dutch Jews with samples of wool and 
linen yarn, one feels small inclination to spend the evening at the 
hotel in writing that sort of thing. However, if anything is to be 
extracted from him, Marx is the man to do it. 
The sudden lull in the émigrés' tittle-tattle brought about by the 
new turn of events in France is truly comical. Not a whisper do I 
hear about the whole caboodle. 
The prisoners in Cologne are in a serious position. Since there is

no charge whatever against them, the Board of indicting 
magistrates has neither released them nor brought them before 
the Court of Assizes but—has referred the matter back to the first 
examining magistrate for a fresh investigation! In other words, 
they will remain provisionally in clink without books, without 
letters, without being able to communicate either with one another 
or with the outside world, until the new state tribunal is ready.3

Dear Marx, 
Do you recall a refugee by the name of Richter from Torgau 
(Prussian Saxony), a saddler and upholsterer—who used to be in 
London? This man, whom I recall having seen in London—tall, 
fair, the manners of a refugee—suddenly calls on me here, 
ostensibly having returned from Barmen where, he maintains, he 
worked for a time without papers; he brings greetings from 
Hühnerbein, etc. I can call to mind absolutely nothing about him 
except that I have seen him before. At all events, our register of 
refugees and Pfänder's or Rings' good memory should be able to

tell us more particulars about him. I rather suspect the fellow is a 
member of Willich's clique46—in which case I shall chuck him out 
at once. The man has already found work here. 
So far, I've been able to discover nothing in The Times about 
the business of our people in Cologne.3  I am only awaiting your 
reply to write immediately, s'il y a lieu, to The Daily News. The

Dear Engels, 
Weerth left this morning for Holland. Where will he go from 
there? I do not know and neither does Weerth himself perhaps. 
He was as always very much disgruntled at his lot and, as for ours, 
the only disagreeable thing about it seemed to him our being 
forced to remain here in London instead of Cadiz, Saragossa, or 
some other confounded place in Spain. Indeed, since he ls been 
living in Yorkshire again, Weerth has been saying that the time 
spent in Spain was the best in his life. He maintains that he can't 
stand the English climate and may therefore find that of Holland 
very COMFORTABLE. Let us wish him le bon voyage and wait and see 
whether he keeps his word and remembers about Weydemeyer.

My LETTER  TO THE  EDITOR-  was sent to The Times last Thursday,3  il 
y a donc presque  une  semaine^  It would seem that this paper,  now 
that it makes  a métier  of polemicising against Bonaparte, deems  it 
necessary  to spare Prussia.  So you  must approach  The  Daily News. 
If that,  too,  misfires, which  I doubt, there still remains  The 
Spectator.  Il est  presque sûr. c 
Yesterday  G. J. Harney sent  me the  first issue  of his  resuscitated 
and somewhat enlarged Friend  of the  People. 47 If that's what  he 
withdrew from  the  world  for 8  months  and  buried himself  in 
melancholy Scotland for...!  But un seul passage suffira pour  te faire 
goûter  ce  fruit délicieux^: 
*'Justice —Immutable,  Universal,  Eternal—proclaims  the  sublime principle which 
will be, at  once,  our  guiding star,  the  rule  of our  conduct,  and the  test, etc.'* e 
En voilà assez!1  Bonaparte, however,  he has  adequately chastised 
by calling him 'Louis THE  BASE'. 
I do not  know whether  our  EXDEAR  sent  me his  little paper  in 
order  to wring  our  hearts  or whether,  out of  spite towards  us, he 
has become even more tritely democratic than  we  would have 
believed possible.  By the by,  alongside  the  platitudes  and the 
JUSTICE IMMUTABLE-  there are barefaced tricks played by the  TRADING 
DEMAGOGUE.  Against Jones—via the  'SPIRIT  OF FREEDOM',8  via that  SPOUTER 
Massey, secretary  of the  Tailors' Association  of  Castle Street, 
lickspittle  to the  clerics  who  keep this  SHOP.  Herald,  à tort et à  travers 
of the  petits grands hommes h whom  the  Continent  has  spewed  out, 
calumniator  of Jones, married  to a saltimbanque'  who has  duped 
him into believing that  she is  clairvoyant—he gets this Massey  to 
have  an apologia published  for the  associations  in general  and the 
AMALGAMATED SOCIETY  in particular, a piece which threatens to 
extend over numerous issues. 4W And  Rhadamanthus Harney  had 
told Jones  in person that  au fond'  he shared  his  views  on the 
Associations. At the same time he announces:  'KOSSUTHS RECEPTION 
AND PROGRESS  IN AMERICA', k although in a letter to Jones he described 
Kossuth as a  HUMBUG.  That is what the gentlemen of  SUBLIME PRINCIPLE-
are like.  Je ne  sais que  c'est  que des  principes, sinon  des  règles qu'on 
a See  this volume,  p. 24. - b i.e.  nearly  a week  ago - c It is  almost  a certainty.  -

present aux autres pour soi? Harney retired for a while, allowing 
Jones,  with his tempérament fougueux, h to spoil the broth of 
popularity and then drink it  himself.  But even though he may 
harm Jones, he himself will achieve nothing. The fellow's 
completely done for as a writer and also, according to Lupus who 
heard him spEECH-making in Jones Street, 4 as a speaker, but above 
all as a man. May the devil take these popular 'movements, more 
especially when they are pacifiques. In the course of this Chartist 
agitation O'Connor has gone mad (have you read about his latest 
scene in court?), 3" Harney has gone stale and Jones bankrupt. 
Voilà le dernier but de la vie dans tous les mouvements populaires.' 
Yesterday 'Colonel Bangya' came to see me. Amongst other 
things he said: 'Kossuth made the following speecb to the 
Hungarian refugees who had foregathered with him in London: 
"I will take care of you all but I demand that you all remain loyal, 
devoted and attached to me. I am not such a fool as to sustain 
people who intrigue with my opponents. I demand that everyone 
declare himself unconditionally."' Thus the  HUMBLE  Kossuth behind 
the scenes. I further learned from Bangya that Szemere, Kasimir 
Batthyâny and Perczel {le general) are coming to London and will 
set up an anti-Kossuth committee. Lastly, the master mind behind 
the whole  DODGE  is Signore Mazzini. He is using Kossuth as a 
mouthpiece and, in his cabinet, regards himself as something of a 
Machiavelli. It is he who pulls the strings. But this gentleman is 
unaware that the puppets he causes to dance are heroes only in 
his own eyes and in no one else's. Thus he wrote and told Kossuth 
to get on intimate terms with Kinkel, saying that he personally had 
been unable to do so because he already had the other lot of 
German bigwigs sur le bras d; Kossuth must now really make friends 
with Kinkel and Kinkel must write in all his letters about his 
worthy, his eminent friend and "equal", Kossuth. As for Kossuth, 
however, his idea is to lean on Germany's dictator, Kinkel, on the 
one hand, and on Italy's dictator, Mazzini, on the other, and to 
secure his rear with his ally, the dictator of France, Ledru-Rollin. 
The poor devil has sunk low. 
A Frenchman, Massol by name, has paid me a visit. For a short 
spell he was on the Réforme under Lamennais. Formerly one of 
the civilisateurs'' whom Mohammed Ali had summoned from 
Gaul, 51 he is also one of the few hommes d'esprit* still to be found

among the French. According to him, Sasonow's stay in Paris 
(which, by the way he must now leave) is wholly attributable to his 
possession of a very reliable false passport and to his connections 
with a few femmes galantes 3 who have INFLUENCE in the top circles. 
You will like Massol. 
In addition I have seen les citoyens h Vallières (former Barbèsiste 
and officer at the barricades), Bianchi and Sabatier. Though very 
refined, the latter is en general not above the usual run. 
Dronke, I hear, is in Savoy. 
Bangya has suggested that Szemere and Perczel should write for 
Weydemeyer. What are the main points in the Hungarian business 
(military or otherwise) upon which elucidation should be sought 
from these gentlemen? It goes without saying that they must not 
write under their own names, for we do not want to identify 
ourselves with any coterie. But Perczel is du moins bon républicain^ 
and very knowledgeable. 
Be so good—and mind you don't forget—as to send me the 
Tribunes. Johnson — Freiligrath's friend — wants to read the articles 
on Germany.d Lupus wants to write an anti-Kossuth piece for 
Weydemeyer. 
As for the commercial business, I can no longer make head or 
tail of it. At one moment crisis seems imminent and the CITY 
prostrated, the next everything is set fair. I know that none of this 
will have any impact on the catastrophe. But at the present 
moment London is not the place in which to observe the current 
tendency.

Signore Mazzini. But it is high time that we had some copies of your 
paper." After all, to be able to write for a journal one needs to see it, 
and the zeal of my colleagues is stimulated by seeing their things in 
print. 
Herewith a note, which you should turn into an article, about the 
position of our imprisoned friends in Cologne. 
These people have now been in jug getting on for ten months. 
In November the case went through the Ratskammer, and was 
referred to the Court of Assizes. Next the case came up before the 
Board of indicting magistrates which, before Christmas, delivered 
a verdict, which was motivated as follows: 'In consideration of the 
fact that there is no actual evidence of an indictable offence and 
hence no grounds for sustaining the charge...' (but that, in view of 
the importance attached to the matter by the government, we fear 
for our posts if we drop the case against these people) 'we 
accordingly refer the case back to the first magistrate for 
instruction on various points.' The chief reason for this procrasti­
nation is the government's conviction that, before a jury, it would 
fail ignominiously. Meanwhile it hopes to see the creation of a 
High Court for high treason, or at least the withdrawal of JURIES in 
all cases of political offences, to which end a petition has already 
been laid before the First Prussian Chamber. Our friends are 
locked up in cells, cut off from one another and from the world, 
may receive neither letters nor visits nor even books—things that 
are never denied common criminals in Prussia. 
The Board could never have pronounced such an outrageous 
verdict had the Press evinced the least concern for the case. But 
liberal papers such as the Kölnische remained silent out of 
cowardice and 'democratic' ones (including the Lithographische 
Korrespondenz, published by Kinkel with the help of American 
money) out of hatred for the communists, out of fear of forfeiting 
some of their own importance, out of rivalry towards 'new' 
martyrs. 34 Such is the gratitude shown by these curs to the 
N.Rh.Z., which always stood up for the democratic rabble 
whenever they clashed with the government (e.g. Temme et al). 
Such is the gratitude shown by Mr Kinkel to the Westdeutsche 
Zeitung, in which Becker was his hearth and Bürgers his haven. b

[From Jenny Marx] 
We all of us long to hear from you, dear Mr Weydemeyer, but alas, one ship 
after another comes in without bringing news of you, your dear wife,3 your 
children, your paper, etc., etc. I trust you have safely received all the help sent 
from London. My husband has commandeered on your behalf pretty well all 
available communist quills (and has also turned to Germany), and some of these 
pieces, for instance Freiligrath's poem,b will assuredly secure circulation for your 
paper. If you could somehow contrive to publish pamphlets, I would beg you to 
think it over. We are in a very sad plight here, there being no more hope for us in 
Europe. My husband believes that his articles on France, which will run to two 
more,1 are of the greatest topical interest and would thus provide the most suitable 
material for a small pamphlet, if only as a sequel to his Revue articles.d If a New 
York bookseller were able to establish contact with Germany, he could count on not 
inconsiderable sales there. In any case the thing is written for Europe rather than 
America. However, we shall, of course, leave this to your own discretion. My 
husband further asks that you urge Dana to give us the name of a business house 
here in London where we can collect the fees with the minimum of delay. At this 
distance, Karl could not possibly give Dana any real idea of our circumstances or 
the urgency of the matter, since the situation was quite different when Dana knew 
us in Cologne and such a comfortably situated American has no idea how 
everything hangs in the balance here, and how ten shillings, coming at the right 
moment, can often rescue one from a horrifying situation. Sometime or other you 
may, perhaps, find an opportunity of telling him this personally. With kindest 
regards and warm greetings to your wife

work and COMMERCE. Voici les faits": 1. Charles b has gone to 
Germany and has left me not only with all his own work, but also 
with a nice little residue of tasks left undone at the year's end; 
2. Last year's balance sheet shows a definite loss for my old man 
which may be a good lesson for him, but means that I am 
inundated with an unholy mass of vexations, calculations, and jobs 
of various kinds; 3. One of the Ermensc has given notice of

dence which that brings in its train. Enough: this evening I shall 
be stuck in the office until 8 and, instead of being able to write to

take it to the  POST  OFFICE before twelve o'clock tonight; tomorrow 
evening I must do something for Jonesd and the day after 
tomorrow I shall see to it that I finish an article for the Tribune." 
For the present there can be no thought of spare time before 7 or 
8 in the evening, and the worst of it is that, for some time to 
come, I shall have to devote my whole attention to filthy 
commerce, otherwise everything will go wrong here and my old 
man will cut off my SUPPLIES.

I shall write to you at length on Saturday. Only a few lines today. 
I have not yet received the money that was promised me from 
home and so have not yet been able to hand over your £2 to 
Pieper, but have told him I have had a few lines from you in 
which you informed me that I should be receiving money for him 
from you. I hope I shall be able to pay him before the-week is out. 
If your time is very much taken up, you would certainly do 
better to write for Dana than for Jones. The enclosed letter from 
Weydemeyer55 will show you even more plainly how essential it is 
not to interrupt these articles.a What must be done now is to 
redouble our attacks in the Tribune on the Frankfurt Left,56 
especially when you come to the 'March Association'.57 To help 
you, I am today sending you Bauer's book* in which at least a few 
facts are to be found. 
I again pray you to send me the issues of the 'Tribune' by return, since

Manchester, 19 February 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Despite tremendous efforts—your letter only arrived this 
morning—I have still not finished the article for Danab and it is 
now 11 o'clock at night. I have received the Bauerc—it is coming 
in very useful. In return, and whatever happens, you will receive 2 
articles for Dana for next Tuesday's STEAMER. Since your letters 
reach Weydemeyer and mine don't, I'd be glad if you would 
forthwith dispatch the enclosed note to W.d  in one of your own. 
It's an altogether curious business. It seems that two or three of 
my letters to my old man have also failed to reach him. Cela n'est 
pas clair." 
Tell Jones he will be getting something from me next week, or 
write him a note to that effect. God knows why so many snags 
should crop up all at once and prevent me from getting down to 
anything. But on Saturday and Sunday I shall shut myself away, 
and then I hope to get something done. 19

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 19 February 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
To my intense surprise I see from your letter of 6 Feb. per the 
Arctic that not one of my letters to you has arrived. I have sent 
you 4, if not 5, articles on England 17  and only desisted a fortnight 
ago because I had heard absolutely nothing from you: my last 
article went by the STEAMER which left on Saturday 31 Jan. from 
Liverpool, and concerned the REFORM BILL to be anticipated from 
little Russell. The first 2 letters were addressed to 
Mr J. Weydemeyer, Deutsche Vereinsbuchhandlung, William 
Street, New York; the others to Mr J. W., 7 Chambers' Street, 
New York (City). Since this matter requires investigation, I am 
sending you this through Marx whose letters, it seems, are 
reaching you; I would ask you, 1. to go to the above places and see 
whether the letters were presented there; 2. if not, to go and in­
quire at the N. Y. CITY POST OFFICE. If they are not to be found 
there, advise me by the first Liverpool STEAMER and I shall see what 
further steps can be taken here; I can easily get the thing into the 
newspapers over here if the local postmaster fails to give me a 
satisfactory answer. I posted several of the letters  myself,  the rest 
went with the business mail, and that proves that they were 
a L. Simon's 'Movements of the German Political Exiles', New-York Daily Tribune, 
No. 3369, 4 February 1852. See also this volume, p. 37.

properly attended to, since all our business letters have arrived. 
Take these steps, I beg you, without delay, for otherwise there is 
little point in my sending you any more articles when the 
Revolution comes to life again. 
Make sure you send us L. Simon's Tribune article,3 either a 
cutting—giving the date of the issue—or the whole issue in a 
wrapper, since that sort of thing is always good reading.

MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER ,2 
IN NEW YORK 
[London,] 20 February 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
I can send you nothing this week for the simple reason that for 
a week or more I have been so beset by money troubles that I 
have not even been able to' pursue my studies at the Library,6 let 
alone write articles. 
However, I think that by Tuesday (the 24th) and Friday (the 
27th) I shall be able to send you Nos. 5 and 6 of my article/ which 
are the concluding ones. 
I received your letter, along with Cluss' concluding remarks on 
18 February. You have been particularly unfortunate in two 
respects: 1. unemployment in New York; 2. the raging westerlies, 
which have driven vessels bound from London to America off 
course. For, with the exception of the early days, contributions 
have been sent you from England (by me, Engels, Freiligrath, 
a See this volume, p. 39. - b of the British Museum - c  K. Marx, The Eighteenth 
Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.

Eccarius, etc.) as regularly as any newspaper could hope for. 
However, the people here have begun to flag because no news has 
arrived from America, albeit a multitude of ships. I did not think 
fit to inform anyone other than Engels and Lupus of the 
suspension of your paper. 3 It would only make people more 
dilatory. 
If, by the by, you wish to receive regular support from here, 
you will have to fulfil the following conditions: 
1. Write every week and give the date of the letters you have 
received from us. 
2. Keep us fully au courant with everything over there and 
regularly supplied with relevant documents, etc., newspaper 
cuttings, etc. 
You will realise, mon cher, h how difficult it is to contribute to a 
paper on the other side of the ocean without any knowledge of its 
readers, etc. But if you fulfil the above conditions I can guarantee 
you the necessary contributions. I am here at their backs, WHIP in 
hand, and shall have no difficulty in keeping their noses to the 
grindstone. From Germany, too, I have received promises on your 
behalf of contributions and collaboration. If I only knew that the 
paper would survive, I would have someone in Paris who is READY 
to send you a weekly contribution gratis. I shall write to the man, c 
who is one of my best and most intelligent friends. The worst of it 
is that no one likes to work pour le roi de Prusse, d and daily reports 
lose all value if not published immediately on arrival. Since, then, 
you are unable to make any payment, it is all the more necessary 
to convince people that they are doing real party work and that 
their letters are not being pigeonholed. 
It seems to me that you are making a mistake in having your 
letters delivered instead of doing what every newspaper must do, 
that is, advise the Post Office that you will have them collected 
regularly on the arrival of a vessel. In this way misunderstandings 
and delays are more easily avoided. 
Apropos. Do not print Hirsch's statement14 if you have not 
already done so. 
A mass of blackguards is leaving here for New York (amongst 
them tailor Lehmann and tailor Joseph Meyer). Some of them will 
approach you in my name. But don't trust anyone who does not 
bring with him a few lines in my writing. The fellows will serve

well enough to answer questions about Willich, etc. Lehmann and 
Meyer are devotees of Jesus Willich. 
As for Dana, I think it was foolish of him to accept articles from 
Simon.a  If my money-box allowed, I should immediately refuse to 
send him any further contributions. Let him publish attacks on 
myself and Engels but not by such an impertinent nincompoop. 
It's sheer stupidity to permit Agitation and Emigration, 26 those 
twin fictions which exist only on newspaper pages, to be presented 
to the American public as historical realities by a vain fellow who 
has imposed upon Germany the Prussian Emperor,58 the March 
Associations5V  and the Imperial Regent, Vogt, and now, with his 
bankrupt accomplices, would like to impose himself afresh upon 
the people, along with Parliament and a somewhat modified 
Imperial constitution. Rien de plus ridicule que ce gredin-là qui du 
haut des Alpes laisse tomber des paroles d'homme d'état! 1 I should have 
credited Dana with more tact. Ludwig Simon —von Trier! When 
will this fellow drop his patent of parliamentary nobility? 
Here in London, you know, all these fellows have completely 
drifted apart. The only thing that keeps them in any way together 
is the prospect of being redeemed by Gottfried Christ Kinkel's 
money. On the other hand we have that idiot Ruge, together with 
Ronge and two or 3 other jackasses, who conceal their lazy still-life 
by calling it 'agitation', just as a stagnant swamp might be dubbed 
'open sea'. 
Europe, of course, is now busying itself with other troubles than 
these. Ledru-Rollin himself has collapsed here like a punctured 
balloon since 2 Decemberc and the arrival of new revolutionary 
elements from France. Mazzini is making ultra-reactionary 
speeches, one of which I shall shortly analyse for you. 
As regards Ernest Jones' Notes to the People, in which you will 
find all the day-to-day history of the English proletariat, I shall 
send you it as soon as my financial circumstances permit. I have to 
pay 8 shillings every time I send a parcel to America. 
Give Cluss my warm regards. We are eagerly awaiting his letters. 
Why haven't you sent us his statement60? 
I, together with my wife, Freiligrath and wife,d and Lupus, all 
send our heart-felt greetings to your wife, whom please assure of

compelled thus to cry his wares by competition from Harney who 
has got hold of some money, the devil knows where from, and has

I shall search out and send you the issue of the Tribune in 
which Mr Simon blows his own trumpet.55  The incompetent 
nincompoop! He still goes on signing himself 'Simon von Trier'. 
The fellow can't make up his mind to dispense with his 
parliamentary nobility title. Seiler has read the translation of the 
crap in the Staatszeitung. You know how garbled his accounts 
always are. So far as I could gather it went something like this: 
Ludwig Simon von Trier, speaking on behalf of the Swiss émigrés, 
treats the great controversy between 'Agitation' (the name used by 
Ruge and Co. to conceal the dullness of their still-life) and 
'Emigration', 26 with the most prodigious pomposity, as Europe's 
question brûlante* from his 'Alpine height'. At this juncture—and 
here Willich is also cited as a man of the utmost importance, all 
manner of diffuse reflections being proffered concerning the 
acquisition of this hero—he comes to the third of the dangerous 
parties in London, 'the party of imposition', the leaders of which are 
Engels and Marx. For we seek to impose 'liberty' on the peoples by 
force. We are worse tyrants than the Emperor of Russia. We were 
the first to treat 'universal franchise', etc., with 'scorn and 
contumely'. And even before that, we ruined everything with our 
'lust for imposition'. Le pauvre garçon! b Did we impose the Prussian 
Emperor, 58 the 'March Associations'57  or the Imperial Regent Vogt, 
on the Germans 59? On him we shall impose a coup de piea\ c So far 
as these jackasses are concerned, Bonaparte has lived in vain. 
They still go on believing in 'universal franchise', and are solely 
preoccupied with paltry calculations as to how they can again 
impose their rotten personalities on the German people. One can 
hardly believe one's ears when one hears the fellows indefatigably 
bawling out the same old tune again. They are proper blockheads, 
incorrigible blockheads. As to how the vain little rogue found his 
way into the Tribune, I am in no doubt. Le citoyen Fröbel aura été 
l'homme intermédiaire. 0 He has long been connected with Dana. 
Enclosed a letter from Reinhardt, which contains some pretty 
cancans. e 
Russell has been overthrown in the drollest possible manner.62 I 
can ask nothing more than that Derby should take the helm.

victory, e.g. the BALLOT,64  is a concession which, of course, they 
make to the workers only en cas d'urgence.* 
Yesterday I was talking to a French MERCHANT just come from 
Paris.  Business wretched. And do you know what the jackass said? 
Bonaparte fait pire que la république. Les affaires allaient mieux. b It is 
truly fortunate that the French bourgeois should always hold their 
government responsible for commercial crises. No doubt 
Bonaparte is also to blame for the unemployment in New York 
and the bankruptcies in London. 
Another very interesting piece of information (tu sens ici 
l'influence de l'illustre Seiler c) about Bonaparte. Bangya, as I have 
already told you, is connected with Szemere and Batthyâny. d He is 
an agent of the latter's. He confided to me that Batthyâny and 
Czartoryski are in collusion with Bonaparte and see him nearly 
every day. He wants to secure allies behind the backs of Russia 
and Austria amongst the aristocratic émigrés and those streaming 
in from Poland and Hungary and has, moreover, definitely told 
them that, in spite of Nicholas and all the rest, he is going to 
invade Belgium and perhaps Baden as well, and this in the near 
future. 
Ewerbeck has sent me 12 copies of his bulky work, L'Allemagne 
et les Allemands. One for you. Nothing quite like it has ever been 
seen or heard of before. The historical part, which begins ab ovo, e 
is copied from out-dated primers. You may judge how competent 
he is as regards more recent history from the following 
particulars: F. List introduced the doctrine of Free Trade, and 
Ruge that of social science, into Germany. Hegel has immortalised 
himself by (literally) enlightening the Germans on the categories of 
quality, quantity, etc., and Feuerbach has proved that men cannot 
extend their knowledge beyond the range of human understand­
ing. Pedro Düsar (brother of the Struve woman) is one of the 
greatest German men of liberty, and Freiligrath made his name as 
a collaborateur on the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. On top of that a 
style à pouffer de rire, 1 e.g. how Jason's warriors grew from 
dragon's teeth, which is why the German tribes are perpetually at 
odds with one another. Romulus Augustulus était un jeune homme 
doux et agréable^ and for three hundred years Germans have been

Dear Lassalle, 
I should greatly like to know whether my second letter65 
similarly failed to arrive. Knowing how punctilious you are about 
answering, I can only attribute the delay in hearing from you to 
some accident. 
Since I last wrote my state of health has again improved, 
although I am still having much trouble with my eyes. My social 
circumstances, on the other hand, have deteriorated. I have had a 
definite refusb from the publisher in respect of my Economy45 ; my 
anti-Proudhon manuscript/ which for the past year has been 
wandering around Germany, has likewise failed to find a berth; 
the financial crisis has finally reached a level comparable only to 
the commercial crisis now making itself felt in New York and 
London. Unlike the gentlemen of commerce, I cannot, alas, even 
have recourse to bankruptcy. Mr Bonaparte was in similar straits 
when he chanced his coup d'état.

As to this Mr Bonaparte, I feel I can do no better than give you 
extracts from a letter conveyed to me by a friend in Paris,3  un ami 
qui est très sceptique et qui ne partage pas les opinions les plus favorables 
sur le peuple. Maintenant, écoutez h: 
'All in all, the mood of the Parisian public has experienced a noticeable change 
and, even though it has as yet not gone beyond resignation, this last is felt all the 
more genuinely and grimly, and far more generally. The main reason for this, 
among the middle and lower classes, is that trade and hence employment, despite 
initial favourable appearances, simply cannot be got going, whereas those same 
classes had sacrificed all other considerations to the hope that these things would 
improve. And then the slow-witted majority of the less advanced workers —which 
places more hope in the Republic than in the monarchies of long and bitter 
memory—has, as a result of Napoleon's decrees, gradually come to realise that the 
President is in no way concerned with the preservation of the Republic; and he has 
done himself great harm in the eyes of property owners by confiscating the 
Orleans' estates, a measure which, after all, sets a dangerous official example. 
Chaps such as Fould, de Morny and Dupin—for reasons of private interest of 
course—have even refused to subscribe to this measure, a fact all the more striking 
on account of their spotless antecedents, which are more or less common 
knowledge. As for Dupin, the President of the defunct National Assembly, it has 
since been learnt that his last pretty move was to suppress, on the morning of 2 
December and with the connivance of Bonaparte, a letter from the Archbishop of 
Paris inviting the representatives to assemble in the church of Notre Dame while he 
himself intended to stand in the porch to protect them, in their capacity as the 
representatives of popular sovereignty, against the soldiers of the usurper. This might 
have given quite a different turn to the whole thing, the more so since the haute cour de 
justice' had assembled at the same time and had already begun to register a protest 
against the coup d'état. 
'As for de Morny, the minister who resigned with Dupin, he was known as the 
escroc d of his mistress' (Countess Lehon's) husband, a circumstance which caused 
Emile de Girardin's wife to say that while it was not unprecedented for 
governments to be in the hands of men who were governed by their wives, none 
had ever been known to be in the hands of hommes  entretenus.?  Well, at present this 
same Countess Lehon holds a salon where she is one of Bonaparte's most 
vociferous opponents and it was she who, on the occasion of the confiscation of the 
Orleans' estates, let fall the well-known witticism: "C'est le premier vol de l'aigle." f 
Because of this remark of his wife's, Emile de Girardin was expelled. Rémusat's 
expulsion is attributed to a similar cause. The latter is said to have arrived one 
morning at the Ministry of the Interior where Morny had installed young Lehon as 
Chef de Bureau; upon catching sight of Rémusat, Lehon rudely asked him his 
name, whereat R. replied: "Monsieur, dans ma famille on porte le nom de son père, c'est 
pourquoi je me nomme de Rémusat." s At much the same time Lehon is said to have 
a Reinhardt - b a friend who is very sceptical and does not have the highest 
opinion of the people. Now, listen: - c High Court of Justice - d swindler - e kept 
men - f  'It is the first flight (theft) of the eagle.' (This witticism and Madame de 
Girardin's remark cited above are used by Marx in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte, see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 196-97.) - s 'In my family, sir, we bear 
our father's name. That's why I am called de Rémusat.'

had another row, on this occasion in Ham. When he gave General Le Flô official 
notification of expulsion, the general threw him out, shouting: "Comment, c'est vous, 
gredin, qui osez venir m'annoncer mon  exil?"  a In such circumstances, it is not difficult 
to assess how much respect a fledgling government will continue to command, even 
from the most mediocre of honnêtes gens. b A lady known to me personally, a ward 
of Napoleon's, who had been in close contact with him ever since she was a child, 
told him on 2 December that she would have nothing more to do with him, adding 
that he and his associates were a gouvernement de voleurs et d'assassins. c True, the 
real plutocrats continue to adhere to Napoleon as being the only possible 
expression of authority just now and the last bulwark of existing society, but their 
faith in the possible durability of his régime has been much undermined by his 
measures, with the result that, after a brief interval, they have again begun to hug 
their money, as is evident from the stagnant Bourse and the check to the revival of 
trade. Thus the President's only real following consists of those who are bound to 
him by the most blatant self-interest, along with the privileged clerical clique and 
the army, although considerable dissatisfaction and a feeling of uncertainty and 
irresolution has crept into the latter as a result of the many dismissals of Orleanist 
officers, a state of affairs which enormously impairs its power. Moreover, 
personally and in private, the President is said to be most anxious and downcast. 
Indeed, in this changed climate of opinion, all that is needed is the removal of his 
sorry person and everything would be thrown into chaos again without any effort. 
Little or no attempt would be made at resistance. In this connection the remark by 
the experienced Guizot, on learning of the successful coup d'état, is worthy of note: 
"C'est le triomphe complet et définitif du socialisme!" d 
'Having both before and after fallen out with every party without exception, 
Bonaparte is seeking a counterbalance by means of this or that popular 
measure—vast expansion of public works, prospects of a general amnesty for the 
participants of 2 December, etc.—just as he will soon attempt something similar by 
means of this or that measure in favour of this or that class, and all without 
consistency of purpose. And what matters most of all is his failure to win back the 
masses, since he is unable to give them bread, i.e. any source of labour for their 
livelihood, and has actually deprived them of their favourite pastime, the innocent 
consolation they derived from the trees of liberty and the republican inscriptions in 
the streets; similarly they can no longer while away an hour in the wine and coffee 
shops,  since all political discourse is strictly prohibited there. The peaceable 
bourgeois are angered by the loss of their hobby-horse, the National Guard... Nor 
do they fancy those aristocratic routs, the state balls, from which they stay away; 
thus,  apart from foreigners and two or three Parisian exceptions, the only people 
to attend the last, splendide, Tuileries ball were ladies of doubtful virtue. The 
reckless squandering that goes on is a source of disquiet to the thrifty citizens, who 
look ahead to the day when the Orleans funds will be exhausted. 
'What particularly offends all who have a modicum of intelligence is the 
destruction of the Press. 
'Again, die organisation of the resuscitated Police Ministry and the spy system 
associated with it generates bad blood throughout the départements. The Parisian 
salons are again full of distinguished, unsuspected informers, just as in the days of

one way or another, arbitrarily grant or withdraw concessions for railways, etc., the 
instructions about which they alone had knowledge of, and upon which they 
speculate the previous day. It was believed that a secret college of Jesuits, headed 
by Montalembert, who had always been on terms of some intimacy with the 
President, exerted direct and immediate influence on his decisions; but as for 
Montalembert, it soon emerged that, after availing himself of his advice, Bonaparte 
suddenly dismissed him from his presence never to receive him again, so that ever 
since they have been the bitterest of enemies, and M., personally no less miserable, 
used the Orleans decree merely as a pretext for dissociating himself officially with 
honour. Now there is talk of nothing but B.'s craving for conquest. It will be his 
complete undoing.' 
So much for my ami. 
The important news from here is that the Tories have replaced 
the Whigs, and formed a ministry headed by the Earl of Derby 
(Lord Stanley).62  This événement is splendid. In England our 
movement can progress only under the Tories. The Whigs 
conciliate all over the place and lull everyone to sleep. On top of 
that there is the commercial crisis, which is looming ever closer 
and whose early symptoms are erupting on every hand. Les choses

promise, I have still heard nothing from my mater." Nor has there 
as yet been any reply to my letters to acquaintances in Germany. A 
week ago I reached the pleasant point where I am unable to go 
out for want of the coats I have in pawn, and can no longer eat 
meat for want of credit. Piffling it all may be, but I'm afraid that 
one day it might blow up into a scandal. The only good news 
comes from my ministerial sister-in-law,b namely the news that my 
wife's indestructible unclec is ill. If the cur dies now I shall be out 
of this pickle. 
I shall not be writing at length today, being busy with the 
dictation of an article for Weydemeyerd and the dispatch and 
correction of the other contributions for him. 
I see from the Augsburg paper (through the humble offices of 
Seiler) that Mr Stirner has produced a 'history of the counter­
revolution'. e He tries to prove that the revolution collapsed 
because it was 'sacrosanct' whereas the counter-revolution pre­
vailed because of its 'egoistical' stance. 
On 25 February the French held a February banquet, or rather 
a dry MEETING accompanied by tea and sandwiches. I and wife were 
invited. The rest of the public had to pay 1 franc to go in. Since I 
neither could nor wished to attend, I sent my wife there with a 
FRENCHMAN. Ledru, Pyat, Thoré, Martin Bernard, etc., in short the 
whole Rollinist clique by whom the affair had been mooted, failed 
to appear because they considered the entrée, 1 for the benefit of 
the refugees, to be beneath their dignity. L. Blanc had also cried 
off. Only the lowest dregs of the emigration were there, most of 
whom style themselves Blanquists. But the little pseudo-Corsican g 
was waiting in some near-by parlour; after being assured by his 
spies of the absence of Ledru and Co., he appeared and, in view 
of the total lack of talent and authority, his natty, steel-blue 
tail-coat was received with RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE. His speech, after 
which he immediately departed, sent his enemies into transports. 
Enchanted them. Vanquished them. And what did THAT LITTLE MAN 
say, that Johnny Russell of socialism? That here abroad, people 
were wondering at the strange events in France, that he believed 
more firmly than ever in the star de la patrie. h And why? Je veux,

La France est une nation militaire." She has her élans and her 
catastrophes. Quod erat demonstrandum. What she wanted she has 
always achieved, feudalism banished in 1789, the monarchy in 
1830.  Whom did she wish to overthrow in 1848? The bourgeoisie,

French nation will overcome la misère in the new revolution and

his speech contained three whole jokes. He called Bonaparte 1. un

novelty threw those present into a veritable St. Vitus' dance. Qu'en

whole, their story is epigrammatic, a genuine dramatic work of art, 
but the fellows themselves! Mon dieu! Mr Blanc's sally reminds me 
of a joke I was told by Massol. By midnight Bonaparte is 
invariably befuddled, in the company .of the mâles and femelettes b

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 12 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 27 Feb. 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
I am glad to see that some of my letters have at last arrived and 
hence that no further obstacles stand in the way of our 
correspondence.66  The first two were addressed to J. W., Deutsche 
Vereinsbuchhandlung, William Str., New York. The copies of the 
Revolution and the Demokrat have arrived safely and are being 
forwarded to London today. Mr Heinzen will be delighted by your 
riposte. 11 You summed him up very neatly. Send all further 
consignments of printed matter in the same way, open at both 
ends;  the postage costs very little. 
Of my articles, you could at very most include only the one on 
the invasion67 in any future miscellany. The others are unsuitable 
and have already been overtaken by events. 
As for confrère Standau, the fellow's an erstwhile conspirator 
who fits exactly into the category we depicted in the Revue, in the 
critique of Chenu h—very useful in certain respects, very prone to 
idleness, not always reliable and something of a Rodomonte. 
Anyhow, give him my regards. 
Schmidt of Löwenberg is conducting a crusade against the 
Jesuits in the neighbourhood of St. Louis and has for chief ally 
the ex-trickster and agent of Duchâtel, Mr Börnstein of Parisian 
fame. What else he is up to I do not know. That Dr Maas is a 
supporter of the Marx clique is news to me. I know him only as an 
ex-Palatinate ranter. Fischer, the editor of the New Orleans 
Deutsche Zeitung, is an acquaintance of mine and was a member of 
my bodyguard in Kaiserslautern, 68 but this day-dreamer has since 
become infernally corrupted and Kinkelified, and if Kinkel 
himself has been in New Orleans, he will have done a great deal 
of mischief since he will have met with no opposition.

28. Engels to Weydemeyer. 27 February 1852 53 
So far as the question of a war against England is concerned,3 
just now it interests me primarily as a military problem which one 
tries to elucidate and solve in just the same way as an exercise in 
geometry. But I do not regard a coalition war of this kind as out 
of the question although for the time being, so long as Derby 
remains at the helm, it will certainly be deferred. The gentlemen 
of the Holy Alliance69 assess their forces today no less incorrectly 
than was done in the various coalitions from 1792 to 1807. And as 
for Russia's dependence on England, 1. one cannot expect the 
Tsarb to be sensible of it, and secondly, a suspension of trade, 
while it would result in stagnation, poverty and the spoiling of 
produce, could, after all, be endured for 2-3 years just as could a 
commercial crisis of the same duration. Bear in mind that in 
Russia virtually no money circulates in the country among the 
peasantry, the vast majority, and that these barbarians' every 
household necessity can be produced in any village. True, the 
cities and the aristocracy would suffer, but the Russian Empire is 
founded on peasants and on petty country gentry. An uprising 
on the Continent instigated by England presents great difficulties; 
Spain was helped by her terrain, her great size and sparse popu­
lation, and the lack of provisions, and also the fact of being sur­
rounded on nearly all sides by the sea. But Hungary and Poland 
are land-locked countries while Italy, save for the islands, could 
hardly be held by the English and the insurgents against the superior 
forces of the coalition. Furthermore, England is not now in a 
position, and will not be so a year after the outbreak of war, to 
muster an army like the one sent to Wellington in Spain.70  But 
ships without a landing forcé can never gain a foothold. 
It's a real stroke of luck that the Tories should have taken the 
helm. As a result of the continual victories in the field of com­
mercial policy and the long era of prosperity, the manufacturers 
had grown thoroughly indolent. Parliamentary reform, even when 
more far-reaching than Russell's paltry Bill,71 failed to arouse 
the slightest interest. Now, with the devil hard on their heels, they 
are already scared out of their wits, the more so since every one of 
the new ministers represents, and most brazenly, some aspect or 
other of protectionism. The Anti-Corn Law League72 is being re­
vived here. Parliamentary reform, the extension of the franchise, 
the equalisation of constituencies, secret ballot, have all become 
questions of vital moment to the industrial bourgeoisie, whereas before

they were of immediate interest only to the philistines. Derby must 
announce a dissolution and will probably do so as soon as the 
Army Act and the taxes for the coming year have been voted. In 
May we shall doubtless have another election. The Protectionists 
will gain a few votes and in exchange throw out a few Peelites.73 
But they are still in the minority and, should Derby dare to 
propose the immediate introduction of protective tariffs, he will 
unquestionably take a tumble. But he may be cunning enough to 
defer this. At any rate the movement is now FAIRLY under way in 
England. With Palmerston's dismissal-74 the fun began, as it was 
bound to do after the endless ministerial defeats of the previous 
session. Derby is the second act. Dissolution will be the third. As 
for England's foreign policy under Derby it too, of course, will be 
reactionary; but little that is decisive will happen; maybe a few 
prosecutions of refugees, in which the government will fail, 
attempts to introduce Aliens Bills,75 which will likewise fail, 
perhaps support for attempts to form an anti-Louis Napoleon 
coalition, which will also come to nothing. The Tories are 
frightfully circumscribed in England and, unless they attempt to 
restore the Sidmouth-Castlereagh despotism of  1815-21,  whereby 
they could burn their fingers devilish badly for, within the law and 
on behalf of FREE TRADE, your English bourgeois fights like a 
tiger—the conservative gentlemen will make sorry fools of 
themselves. But Derby (formerly, in his father's lifetime, Lord 
Stanley) is a hot-head and may well have recourse to extreme, if 
not illegal, measures. 
All that is lacking now is a commercial crisis and, with Derby up, 
I rather suspect that it will soon be upon us. The rapid succession 
' of English  FREE  TRADE  measures, followed by the opening up of the 
Dutch colonies, the lowering of tariffs in Spain, Sardinia, etc., etc., 
and the fall in cotton prices (since Sept. 1850 down to half their 
former value), are keeping prosperity going longer than might 
have been expected. But, given the state of the Indian and to 
some extent the American markets (appreciably fewer manufactures 
were exported to the United States last month than in the same 
period last year), the thing cannot be expected to last much longer. 
If, as seems hardly probable, the crisis comes as early as May, then 
the fun will begin. But it will hardly be here before September or 
October. 
My regards to your wife.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 2 March 1852 
Dear Marx, 
By now you will have received the £5 I sent off yesterday, half 
of it direct to you and half under cover to Lupus. My 
congratulations on the news of the illness of the old Brunswick 
inheritance-thwarter3; I trust the catastrophe will at last come to 
pass. 
According to the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung, Stirner's Geschich­
te der Reaktion is a wretched compilation, or rather a patchwork of 
gleanings from what he has read and from his own published and 
unpublished newspaper articles—'rejected leaves and blossoms' on 
everything in the world and somewhat more—2 volumes which 
conclude with the threat that the third will contain 'the ground­
work and the system'. b Far from aspiring to sacrosanctity, his own 
glosses seem rather to be destined for higher schools for young 
ladies. 
Little Simon von Trier must inevitably make an absolute ass of 
himself in Dana's eyes by attributing such ludicrous nonsense to 
us, when Dana can see for himself that our articles contain 
ANYTHING BUT THAT.C It is preposterous of Dana not to send us the 
Tribune or you the money; I think the best plan would be to set 
Weydemeyer onto him, he at least would be able to send us the 
Tribune and at the same time settle the money question by word

of mouth. Whether he advises you of a business house in London 
or sends a bill of exchange is immaterial. My article, which was to 
have gone by the Southampton STEAMER, missed it since I had 
miscalculated its departure by one day. Now you will be getting it 
on Friday, along with another which will bring the thing up to the 
end of 1848.a These will be followed by the Prussian Chambers, 
the campaign for the Imperial Constitution77  and, finally, the 
Prusso-Austrian squabbles of  1850/51,  lastly the conclusion— 
altogether the whole may, perhaps, run to another six-8 articles, 
summa summarum 17-20 articles. 
Charlesb will be back here in a fortnight, when I shall have 
more time. Until then Jones will have to be patient. 
So Mr Derby declares outright that, à la Sir James Graham, he 
will again help the Austrians and Co. to lay their hands on any 
likely bandieras. 78 Hence once again letters will be broken open en 
masse. The main sufferers will be Mazzini and the Hungarians. We 
ourselves will be little inconvenienced. 
But what effrontery on Derby's part! 'I hereby declare that 
given a suitable opportunity, I shall impose a tax on corn. Just 
when that will be is for me alone to decide. But if you, the 
majority in the House of Commons, do not wish to be  des factieux, c 
you must leave me in peace until I have so far consolidated my 
position and so far toryfied the land that I can undo unperturbed 
all that has been accomplished during the past twenty years."1 
Poor HOUSE  OF COMMONS! In place of a ministry that found itself in a 
relative minority, they now have one that is in absolute and 
permanent minority; and they are not even permitted to oppose it. 
But those milksops, the  FREE  TRADERS,  have got no more than their 
deserts. The fellows won a battle, captured a new strategic line, 
and failed to occupy and fortify it, failed, indeed, to profit by their 
victory and even merely to pursue the enemy. Now they must 
again join battle on the same ground. The Tory avènement, e 
however, has suddenly made these questions abundantly plain to 
the fellows. Parliamentary reform, taken to the point at which 
Tories and Whigs, at least in their unadulterated form, are for 
ever precluded from power and a majority of industrialists in the 
Cabinet and in Parliament is assured, has now become a vital 
question to the manufacturers. Here these GENTLEMEN are again very 
active. At this moment the Anti-Corn Law League72 is meeting 
and discussing whether to reorganise  itself.  Cobden, Bright,

Milner Gibson, etc., are here. No doubt they will at least piece 
together again the bare bones of the organisation. But not until 
the dissolution will the real fun begin. The dissolution, however, 
cannot be long in coming for, despite Derby's honied words and 
his pacific and conciliatory intentions, clashes are unavoidable. 
Unfortunately there is little prospect of the commercial crisis 
coinciding with the dissolution. Business here continues splendid. 
The news from America is exceedingly favourable. What is staving 
off the crisis, and may continue to stave it off for a little while 
longer, is 1. California, both the TRADE it provides and the masses 
of gold coming into circulation, as well as emigration thither, in 
short, all the stimulus that California exerts upon the whole of the 
United States; 2. the curb imposed by the high cotton prices of 
1849 and 1850 upon the cotton industry which did not expe­
rience brisk progress until the spring of 1851; 3. the enormous 
fall in cotton prices—almost 50%—during the past eighteen 
months. In New Orleans the price of cotton  (MIDDLING—the  average 
kind) on 1 Sept. 1850 was 13  V2 cents=73/4d in Liverpool; today 
the price of MIDDLING in New Orleans is 75/s cents=47/8d in 
Liverpool, and for a time it stood at .7 cents. Obviously this is 
bound to bring about a considerable increase in consumption. Last 
year — Jan. and Feb.—here in the cotton district, 29,000 bales 
were consumed weekly, this year 33,000 and that solely American; 
in addition there is Surat, Egyptian, etc.3 —If things continue thus, 
England will consume 800-850 million pounds of cotton this year; 
4. the general timidity to speculate and to launch.with any 
persistent enthusiasm even into gold mines and steamships. From 
everything I see I should say that another 6 months of such 
intensive production as at présent would suffice to inundate the 
whole world; if another 4 months or so be allowed for the goods 
to reach their destination and positive news of over-supply to 
come back, as also for an interim period of reflection before 
people are seized by panic,—then the most likely time for the 
onset of the crisis will be somewhere between Nov. 1852 and Feb. 
1853.  But all this is GUESS-WORK and we could just as well have it in 
September. It should, though, be a fine how-d'ye-do, for never 
before has such a mass of goods of all descriptions been pushed 
onto the market, nor have there ever been such colossal means of 
production. The foolish ENGINEERS' strike 9 will hold it up for at least 
a month; virtually no machines are being made now and they are

very much in demand. Hibbert, Piatt and Sons have hundreds of 
orders from both here and abroad, not one of which they can, of 
course, execute. And when this commercial thunderstorm 
moreover breaks over Mr Derby's head, it will be bad for him! 
The last balance sheet made my old man really hopping mad 
for it shows him as having lost money, despite the general 
prosperity, and he is likely to give notice of termination (i.e. of his 
corporate contract with the Ermens). In which case this business 
will probably shut down as early as next year. The chaos arising 
out of all these goings-on has now reached a peak, and is partly 
why I have such a mass of things to do.

With regard to Weydemeyer's anti-Heinzen article/ Jones has

Heinzen avec un dédain suprème d and enlightens him on the  'WAR  OF 
CLASSES'. 82 The day before yesterday the National Reform League83 
held a big meeting with an audience of at least 2,000. Jones 
subjected Messrs Hume, Walmsley and Co. to some rough 
treatment and scored a real triumph. London and Manchester 
now seem to divide the work between them in such a way that the 
bourgeois there tend to launch political attacks, and those here 
commercial ones. 
A few days ago a manifesto by Signore Mazzini written in 
Italian fell into my hands. He is the holy bourgeois quand même' 
and fumes at the 'profane' French bourgeois. He shifts the 
initiative from Paris to Rome. 'II materialismo' and 'il egoismo' have 
ruined France. The workers have inherited both vices from the 
bourgeoisie. Since 1815 France has no longer been the country of 
initiative. Italy and Hungary are now the chosen countries. 
While 'signore Mazzini', as Peter the Hermit, castigates the 
wicked French, he licks the boots of the English FREE TRADERS who 
doubtless personify 'le dévouement' and 'la foi'. L'imbécile! 1

MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 84 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 5 March 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Weywy, 
I am afraid there has been a bit of a muddle because, HAVING 
MISUNDERSTOOD THY LAST LETTER, I addressed the last 2 packages to: 
Office of the Revolution, 7 Chambers' Street, Box 1817. What 
caused the confusion was that damned 'Box 1817', since you had 
written telling me to append this to the 'old address' without 
drawing any distinction between the first address and the second. 
But I hope the matter will have resolved itself before this letter 
arrives, the more so since last Friday's letter3 contained the very 
detailed fifth instalment of my article. This week I was prevented 
from finishing the sixth, which is also the last one.85 If your paper 
is appearing again, this delay will not prove an obstacle since you 
have an ample supply of material. 
Your article against Heinzen, unfortunately sent to me too late 
by Engels, is very good, at once coarse and fine, and this is the 
right combination for any polemic worthy of the name. I have 
shown this article to Ernest Jones and enclosed you will find a 
letter from him addressed to you, intended for publication. 82 Since 
Jones writes very illegibly and with abbreviations, and since I 
assume that you are not yet an OUT-AND-OUT Englishman, I am 
sending you, along with the original, a copy made by my wife, 
together with the German translation; you should print them both, 
the original and the translation, side by side. Below Jones' letter 
you might add the following comment: As to  George  Julian Harney, 
likewise one of Mr Heinzen's authorities, he published our

words  of 'wisdom brushed aside'  by Heinzen, namely  my articles  on 
the French Revolution from  the  Revue  der N. Rh. Z.,a and in a 
paper  on  Louis Blanc  he refers  his  readers  to these articles  as 
being  the  'true critical examination'  of the  French affair.b  By the 
way,  in England there  is no  need  to have recourse only  to 
'extremists'.  If, in  England,  a Member  of Parliament becomes  a 
minister,  he must have himself re-elected. Thus Disraeli,  the new 
Chancellor,  LORD OF THE EXCHEQUER,  writes to his constituents on 
1 March: 
* 'We  shall endeavour  to terminate that strife  of classes  which,  of late years,  has 
exercised  so pernicious  in influence over  the  welfare  of this kingdom.*0 
Whereupon  The  Times  of 2  March comments: 
* 'If anything would ever divide classes  in this country beyond reconciliation, 
and leave  no chance  of a  just  and  honourable peace,  it would  be a tax on  foreign 
corn.'  * 
And lest some ignorant  'man of  character"1 like Heinzen should 
suppose that  the  iristocrats  are for and the  bourgeois against  the 
Corn Laws72 because  the  former want 'monopoly'  and the  latter 
'freedom'—your worthy citizen sees opposites only  in this ideologi­
cal form—we shall content ourselves with saying that,  in England, 
in the  eighteenth century,  the  aristocrats were  for  'freedom'  (of 
trade)  and the  bourgeois  for  'monopoly',—precisely  the  same 
attitude  as is  adopted  by the two  classes  in present-day 'Prussia' 
towards  the  'Corn Laws'.  6 There  is no  more rabid FREETRADER than 
the Neue  Pr. Z. 
Finally,  if I  were  you, I  should tell  the  democratic gents  en 
general that viiey would  do  better  to acquaint themselves with 
bourgeois literature before they venture  to yap at its  opponents. 
For instance they should study  the  historical works  of Thierry, 
Guizot, John Wade  and so  forth,  in order  to enlighten themselves 
as to the  past 'history  of the  classes'. They should acquaint 
a K. Marx,  The  Class Struggles  in France,  1848 to 1850.  Published  in the  Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue.  By the  English translation  of this 
work Marx means Engels' review  of the  first chapter published under  the  tide 'Two 
Years  of a  Revolution;  1848 and 1849' in The  Democratic Review, April-June 
1850.  - b [G. J.  Harney,] Review  of Louis Blanc's Historic Pages from  the  French 
Revolution  of  February  1848 in The  Democratic Review,  May 1850, pp. 465-
66. - c Here  and  below Marx quotes from Disraeli's 'Address  to His  Constituents' 
published under  the  date-line: 'London, Tuesday,  2 March 1852',  The  Times, 
No. 21052,  2 March  1852. - d  Presumably  an allusion  to Heine's satirical poem

themselves with the fundamentals of political economy before 
attempting to criticise the critique of political economy. For 
example, one need only open Ricardo's magnum opus to find, on 
the first page, the words with which he begins his preface: 
* 'The produce of the earth—all that is derived from its surface by the united 
application of labour, machinery, and capital, is divided among three  classes  of the 
community; namely the proprietor of the land, the owner of the stock or capital 
necessary for its cultivation, and the labourers by whose industry it is cultivated.'*a 
Now, in the United States bourgeois society is still far too 
immature for the class struggle to be made perceptible and 
comprehensible; striking proof of this is provided by C. H. Carey 
(of Philadelphia),1 " the only North American economist of any 
note.  He attacks Ricardo, the most classic representative c of the 
bourgeoisie and the most stoical opponent of the proletariat, as a 
man whose works are an arsenal for anarchists and socialists, for 
all enemies of the bourgeois order.d He accuses not only him, but 
also Malthus, Mill, Say, Torrens, Wakefield, MacCulloch, Senior, 
Whately, R. Jones, etc.—those who lead the economic dance in 
Europe—of tearing society apart, and of paving the way for civil 
war by showing that the economic bases of the various classes are 
such that they will inevitably give rise to a necessary and 
ever-growing antagonism between the latter. He tries to refute 
them, not, it is true, like the fatuous Heinzen, by relating the 
existence of classes to the existence of political privileges and 
monopolies, but by seeking to demonstrate that economic conditions: 
rent (landed property), profit (capital) and wages (wage labour),' 
rather than being conditions of struggle and antagonism, are 
conditions of association and harmony. All he proves, of course, 
is that the 'undeveloped' relations in the United States are, to him, 
'normal relations'. 
Now as for  myself,  I do not claim to have discovered either the 
existence of classes in modern society or the struggle between 
them. Long before me, bourgeois historians had described the 
historical development of this struggle between the classes, as had 
bourgeois economists their economic anatomy. My own contribu­
tion was 1. to show that the existence of  classes  is merely bound up 
with certain historical phases in the development of production; 2. that 
the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the

proletariat; 3. that this dictatorship itself constitutes no more than a 
transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society. 
Ignorant louts such as Heinzen, who deny not only the struggle 
but the very existence of classes, only demonstrate that, for all 
their bloodthirsty, mock-humanist yelping, they regard the social 
conditions in which the bourgeoisie is dominant as the final 
product, the non plus ultra* of history, and that they themselves are 
simply the servants of the bourgeoisie, a servitude which is the 
more revolting, the less capable are the louts of grasping the very 
greatness and transient necessity of the bourgeois regime  itself. 
Select from the above notes whatever you think fit.88 By the way, 
Heinzen has adopted our 'centralisation' in place of his 'federative 
republic', etc.89 When the views on classes we are now disseminat­
ing have become familiar objects of 'sound common sense',b then 
the scoundrel will proclaim them aloud as the latest product of his 
'own sagacity' and yap his opposition to our onward progress. Thus, 
in the light of his 'own sagacity', he yapped at Hegelian philosophyc 
so long as it was progressive. Now he feeds on its stale scraps, spat out 
undigested by Ruge. 
Herewith also the end of the Hungarian article.*1 It is all the 
more essential that you should try to make some use of

ENGELS TO MARX 92 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 18 March 1852 
Dear Marx, 
I return herewith Pixie's3  letter. I am pour le moment entièrement 
dépourvu 0 and would not be able to raise the £2—at least this 
month; moreover, his letter is dated the 5th and there is absolutely 
no knowing whether the money would still reach him. And then 
it's always a ticklish business sending money to Ewerbeck; the 
fellow is capable of making superannuated claims for God only 
knows what old postal expenses, and of pocketing the whole 
amount or the best part of it. For all these reasons I am unable 
just now to help the little sprite, 3 doubtful though I am that he 
will be able to extract more than five sous at one go from 
Monsieur Ewerbeck. Meanwhile, the piccolo* has left Geneva for 
Paris and thus will no doubt also come to London, if at the cost of 
some 'toil and trouble'; and then we shall know just how much his 
dunning letters mean.

If the little man1 does come, you will have some difficulty in 
restraining his pugnacious temperament, surely much exacerbated 
by prolonged 'toil and trouble'; in this country fisticuffs and 
brawls cost too much money for him to be permitted to indulge in 
them.93  It would be best if you entrusted him to Pieper so that the 
latter could instruct him in political economy. What you told me 
about Massol b is very interesting, and if he stays over there I 
should very much like to meet him. 
I am delighted by what you tell me about Jones 0—just now I 
have damnably little time, otherwise I would send him more 
articles. But Charlesd is not yet back from Germany and then, 
after toiling all day in the office, it would really be too much to 
write a regular weekly article for him and/or Weydemeyer on top 
of the article for the Tribune and the weekly report for my old 
man. Moreover, I must at long last get to grips with the Slav 
business.94  In my previous dilettante fashion, I achieved nothing 
for a whole year and, having at least made a start and got too far 
to abandon the thing, I must now regularly devote some time to it. 
For the past fortnight I have been swotting hard at Russian and 
have now got the grammar pretty well licked; in another 2-3 
months I shall have acquired the necessary vocabulary, and then I 
shall be able to tackle something else. I must be done with the 
Slavonic languages this year and au jond c they are not so very 
difficult. Apart from the linguistic interest I derive from the thing, 
there is the further consideration that, come the next big political 
drama, at least one of us should be familiar with the languages, 
history, literature and the minutiae of the social institutions of 
those particular nations with which we shall immediately find 
ourselves in conflict. In effect, Bakunin only came to anything 
because no one knew Russian. And a great deal is going to be 
made of the old pan-Slavic DODGE of transmogrifying the old Slav 
system of communal property into communism and depicting the 
Russian peasants as born communists. 
Now that old O'Connor has definitely gone mad, Jones is 
perfectly right to crowd on all sail. This is his chance and if, in 
addition, CITIZEN Hip-hip-hurrahf gives up, his cause is won. From 
all that I see, the Chartists are in such a state of complete 
dissolution and disintegration, and at the same time are so lacking 
in able people, that either they must disband altogether and break 
up into cliques, i.e. in effect become a mere appendage of the

FINANCIALS,28  or else be reconstructed on a new basis by some 
competent fellow. Jones is moving in quite the right direction and 
we may well say that, without our doctrine, he would not have 
taken the right path and would never have discovered how, on the 
one hand, one can not only maintain the only possible basis for 
the reconstruction of the Chartist party—the instinctive class 
hatred of the workers for the industrial bourgeoisie—but also 
enlarge and develop it, so laying the foundations for enlightening 
propaganda, and how, on the other, one can still be progressive 
and resist the workers' reactionary appetites and their prejudices. 
MASTER  Harney, by the way, is in for a surprise if he continues as 
he is; the group of enthusiasts which supports him will very soon 
kick him out, and not even the portraits of Kosciuszko and other 
'patriots'95 that adorn his bumf will save him. 
Quoad Napoleonem* did the man not tell L. Blanc when he went 
to France: 'Quand je serai président, je mettrai en pratique vos idées' b} 
And now we see how a financial predicament may drive even a 
true socialist like L. N. to financial measures of an impeccably 
bourgeois kind, such as the conversion of bonds. 96 Your 
SHOPKEEPER  and small industrialist is prepared to overlook twenty 
socialist capers in return for this one saving of 18 millions, and 
The Daily News admires the measure. Anything more stupid or 
more abject than the Débats' comments on this topic would be 
hard to imagine/ The same old story: postal reform=socialism! 
Conversion of bonds=socialism! FREE  TRADE=socialism!  My only fear 
is that Mynheer Napoleon who, for all that he proceeds very 
diffidently when it comes to his genuinely socialist undertakings and 
goes no further in the matter of mortgages than the bourgeois 
Prussian credit institutions, may, in the end, be compelled, by force 
of circumstances, to transform all his socialist inclinations into simple 
bourgeois reforms, and then nothing can deliver us but the 
inevitable financial predicament. The Daily News is right, conversion 
of bonds is a mesure éminemment pacifique 6 as well as being a most 
ominous indication that L. N. is tending to fall into the ways of 
bourgeois  COMMON  SENSE.  But when, I ask you, has it ever been possible 
to rule France with COMMON SENSE, and what a hotch-potch of 
circumstances would be required to bring together a L. N. and 
COMMON  SENSE!  At all events the climate on the Continent does not seem

very revolutionary  to me,  although  the  little sprite will bring quite 
different news. 
I do not  think that Derby will obtain  a majority although this 
place, where unanimity reigns when  it comes  to the  Corn Laws,72 
is a poor point d'observation. However,  I should like  him to  obtain 
one, for  then things must come about  as you say. He is, by the 
way,  a fool  for not  dissolving Parliament  at once.  The  longer  he 
procrastinates,  the  greater  the  risk of the  election coinciding with  a 
commercial crisis,  and  then he'll  get  fanatical Tories  in Parliament 
who are too  rabid even  for him, and  determined, rapacious 
MANCHESTER MEN  6S under threat  of bankruptcy, these latter probably 
in the  majority  and  hence  the  determining element. 
Our  CONCERN  here seems likely  to collapse within  the  year.  In 
which case, while  the  liquidation  is under way,  I shall  at first enjoy 
far more liberty  and be  less tied down  by the  regular routine  of 
the office. Later,  my old man  writes,  he might  be able  to find  me a 
better position—I suspect that  he  will fall  in with  my old  plan  to 
remove  to Liverpool  and buy  cotton  for him  there. That would  be 
splendid  and, if it  comes  off and you  have completed your 
preliminary work  on  economics,45  you and  your whole family must 
come  up for 6  months—we would live  by the sea at New 
Brighton,  and you  would, besides, save money.  At all  events,  I 
shall  get  myself  a rise—there's  no  doubt about that. 
Today, unfortunately,  I shall  not  have  a quiet moment  in which 
to do the  Tribune article,  but an  American  STEAMER  sails next 
Wednesday,  so you  shall have  it by  Monday  or Tuesday,  and  then

Dear Weydemeyer, 
Good luck to the new world citizen! There is no more splendid 
time to enter this world than the present. Come the day when 
people can travel from London to Calcutta in a week, both our 
heads will long since have rolled or started to loll. And Australia 
and California and the Pacific Ocean! The new world citizens will 
be unable to comprehend how small our world once was. 
If you did not receive the final instalment3 enclosed herewith a 
week ago, your total silence is to blame. 
Now in the pamphlet,97  too, I would like my article to be divided 
up as it was sent to you, under headings I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII. 
These figures serve as sign-posts for the reader. They take the 
place of titles. At the end of V, add the following words: 'But 
Bonaparte answered the Party of Order as Agesilaus did King 
Agis:  "J seem to thee an ant, but one day I shall be a lion.'" 98 But the 
thing must, of course, be brought out now all at once in its 
entirety. 
Where my wife has failed to leave space enough to indicate the 
paragraphs, I have marked them with a T . 
Cluss'  statement60 is splendid. 
Why not—it strikes me as a good idea—include Ernest Jones' 
letter in your first issue?82 A couple of introductory words would 
suffice to explain it. 
Maintenant: Cluss will already have told you about the Szemere 
business." First a publisher will have to be contacted through me 
and arrangements made for his pamphlet—some 10 sheets—on 
Kossuth, L. Batthyâny and Görgey —to be brought out in German 
and later in English. You might, if it can be managed, publish the 
German original as your second instalment without, of course, any 
other additions. But the publisher must pay for the thing if you 
don't publish it  yourself.

When this has been arranged—and perhaps even before 
that—the Revolution will receive 500 dollars from this source, on 
condition that Bangya comes in as co-editor, i.e. only in the sense 
that part of the paper is allotted to the Hungarians and run by 
Bangya, Szemere's agent. But you'll have no difficulty in getting 
on with him, car il est bon homme. 3 
I am very glad to hear that you have found employment as a 
surveyor. You will be able to operate with greater confidence and 
peace of mind. 
One of these days I shall be starting on Mazzini. Whereas Mr 
Kinkel, whose wisdom, by his own admission, derives from nursery 
tales,  now chooses to see nothing but unity among the 'great men', 
he finds on his return the battle raging optima forma. h For Ledru 
and Mazzini have bought the Brussels daily La Nation for 10,000 
fr. drawn from the Italian loan. Mais voilà que' il Signore Mazzini 
looses off an opening article, in which he vents all his infamous 
anti-French, anti-socialist inanities about the initiative lost by 
France, d and this so wildly that Ledru now feels compelled—and 
has, it seems, made up his mind—to take issue with him 
personally. On the other hand, the socialists L. Blanc, Pierre 
Leroux, Cabet, Mallarmet, etc., have joined forces and published a 
venomous retort composed by dear little L. Blanc. At the same 
time the majority of the French émigrés are violently incensed 
against Ledru, whom they rightly hold responsible for Mazzini's 
stupidities. Fire has broken out in the very midst of their camp. 
Should you happen to get hold of Der Tag ist angebrochen, a 
book by that miserable cleric, Dulon, who fancies himself as a 
Lamennais, mind you give the cur a good dusting. 
Dronke has been arrested in Paris where he lingered too long 
on his way here from Switzerland instead of hurrying through. 
I like your selection very much. Pieper's article6 might do well 
enough for a newspaper. For a pamphlet it was dashed off too 
hastily and perfunctorily. 
Can you not get news of Edgarf  from Braunfels? We have 
heard nothing from the lazybones and this is causing his mother g 
great anxiety. A crazy lad!

All sorts of things have been happening here. Gottfried Christ 
Kinkel is dispatching, or rather has dispatched, the student Schurz 
and Schimmelpfennig to drum together people from Switzerland, 
Paris,  Germany and Belgium for a congress to be held in London 
in mid-April, the purpose being to guarantee the revolutionary 
loan 2 and to lay down definitive regulations for the administra­
tion of this exchequer and of the democratic government in 
partibus. But you must let me have the trash back by Saturday. 
Kossuth, exposed in America by Szemere102 and completely at 
odds with the committee he left behind him in London, 03 will be 
surprised to learn by what schisms the democratic clerics has 
meanwhile been rent. 
For Mr Mazzini, who for the past 2 years has been pope of the 
democratic church in partibus, thought the time at last ripe to 
discharge his venom in the French tongue against socialism and 
France, to wit in the Brussels Nation which, with Ledru's 
connivance, he had acquired for 10,000 fr. drawn from the Italian 
fund. In it he blamed the socialists for the 2nd December, the 
capture of Rome,104  in short for the counter-revolution generally 
and, in his high-flown Dominican style, thundered against heretics, 
sects,  materialism, scepticism, the Romance Babylon, with the same 
single-mindedness he displays when licking the arse of the English 
liberal bourgeoisie. France, he said, had lost the revolutionary 
initiative. The peuple-roi* no longer existed. Now it was the turn of 
other nations, etc. In short a veritable bull of excommunication 
which was done the honour of being taken up by the Patrie and 
the Constitutionnel. This was altogether too much for the French. 
Little L. Blanc, who further saw in it an opportunity to rehabilitate 
himself and thrust himself to the fore, drummed up Cabet, Pierre 
Leroux, Bianchi, Nadaud and Vasbenter (Proudhonian). In The 
Morning Advertiser they attacked Mr Mazzini in crudest fashion. 
The theoretical part of their retort is almost as weak as Mazzini's 
attack. The personal part, for which Massol gave Leroux the 
material, annihilates the arrogant theopompos. h 
Ledru, for his part, felt it incumbent upon him to resign from 
the European Central Committee in order not to lose all influence. 
He too has replied in the Nation to the attacks on France. Pitiful. 
An article with neither head nor tail. Upholds 'France's revolution­
ary initiative', but in what fashion!  C'est  pour faire pitié! c Ledru, it 
is said, now intends to go to the United States.

fawned like a dog on his rival Kossuth—sees the general 
'confusion', i.e. fusion of all democratic pretenders under the 
banner of the now stale catchwords of 1848, e.g. 'democratic 
republic', 'universal franchise', etc., dissipating. Thus the worthy 
Willich is drawn into the conflict as a 'communist'. 
Meanwhile each week the English government is shipping the 
French émigré mob in crowds out to America at public expense. 
The wretched LITTLE Blanc proposes to exploit a quite fortuitous 
general demonstration against Mazzini to set himself up as the 
visible head of the ecclesia pressa.* In order to thwart his little 
intrigues, I shall get Massol to egg on Pierre Leroux. Finally, to 
complete the confusion, Proudhon is coming here. 
How low the official bigwigs sink, you may see from the fact 
that the delectable Félix Pyat, cet homme artiste 11—an expression 
used by the French to gloss over an individual's every weakness, 
his lack of character and intelligence—has written a melodrama 
on the December days. He has found an English impresario and 
together they will put on the trash in New York, etc., the murder 
scenes, expulsions, deportations, etc., etc. Could anyone seek to 
profit by the misfortunes of his country in a more despicable 
manner? And the jackass regards this prostitution of France's 
misfortune as a patriotic act. 
Tripotage" is the secret key to the historical drama staged by 
émigré politicians here; thus Siegwart d-Kinkel has acted as 
procurer between the student Schurz and Mrs Ronge's sister, who 
is said to be rich. 
The only misfortune is that by their boastful intrigues these 
jackasses provide the police with a continuous supply of fresh 
material and make things worse for our friends in Germany.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 1 April 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Got your letter this morning, actually intact. The new address 
seems to do some good. 
The mirth-provoking émigré documents will be returned to you 
tomorrow. I shall extract some notes from them. 
Little Dronke seems to have got himself properly caught in 
Paris,  otherwise we should probably have heard from him. Do you 
suppose that some people belonging to 'the Marxian sect' really 
foregathered at the Café D., a as the Kölnische Zeitung alleges? b I 
don't know where these remnants could have come from. In any 
case it would have been unpardonable of Dronke to have gone to 
the café and associated  publiquement" 1 with these people. But if he is 
still at liberty and there is any possibility of corresponding with 
him, we must certainly do everything we can now to bring him 
over to London—he is under an expulsion order and the fellows 
are quite capable of sending him to Algiers for rupture de ban. à So 
if we can find out more particulars, I shall see to it that I get hold 
of the £2, for we must certainly bring the little chap to safety. 
Write and tell me if you hear anything about him. 
I am going home now to finish another article for Dana which, 
if it is ready, will go off to you by the second post. Last week I had a 
terrible cold and still have it, so that for several evenings I have 
been capable of absolutely nothing. Otherwise, more would have 
been done. 
Tell Jones that he will be getting sorrfething from me next 
week,e—all my articles for him have, alas, been wretched, since the 
brevity of each and the negligible room available make me 
regularly forget what I wrote the week before—in addition, I have 
to write quickly and cursorily, and have no time whatever to 
collect and arrange material on the latest happenings in France. 
This constant improvisation becomes demoralising.

Should I not finish the article for Dana this evening, it will be 
chiefly because I still have to go through the better part of the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung for April and March 1849, a for on this 
occasion the Frankfurtersb must be given a thorough lambasting.

Dear Frederic, 
Enclosed a further consignment from Cluss105 which I must 
have back by Wednesday (the day of the Leagued meeting). 
The other day, just after you returned his first letter, Dronke 
wrote to Freiligrath from prison; I had forgotten to tell you. 
Freiligrath at once sent the letter to Lassalle for the latter to send 
some money to Paris for him, which could doubtless be done with 
all the more dispatch since Lassalle could use the letter to touch all 
the liberal bourgeois of Düsseldorf. Unfortunately, according to 
the Patrie, compromising letters were found on Dronke. Can he 
have been stupid enough to carry around testimonia of his fatuous 
Lyonnais' and other connections? 
As I foresaw, Louis Blanc is trying to exploit the joint statement 
against Mazzini to create a new 'réseau d'action' { and to thrust

himself to the fore as head of the revolutionary party. He has 
even sought to draw me into his fusion of all 'French' socialists 
and sent me an invitation to meet him. I did not, of course, even 
deign to answer and instead conveyed to his intermédiaire my 
amazement at such importunity. Since Proudhon is coming here, 
an alliance with me just now would have been very convenient for 
the little man. 
Dana has written at last and paid £9 according to the number of 
articles published.' As the presidential elections will for the present 
be taking up every column in the paper, he asks me at the same 
time to conden'se the remainder into 5-6 articles and, more 
especially, to discuss in the last one the  PROSPECTS  OF REVOLUTIONARY 
GERMANY, This will provide a splendid chance to castigate the émigrés 
and in a later letter I shall write to you at length about my views on 
the matter. 
Szemere is sending me, in 3-4 batches, his (German) manuscript 
on 'Kossuth, Görgey and Louis Batthyâny'. Weydemeyer is to 
publish it in America, 99 which means excellent business for him, 
the more so since he will, in addition, probably receive 500 dollars 
for his paperb from that quarter. 
But before the thing goes off to America in German, it must be 
translated into English here so that, after it has appeared in 
German in America, it can be brought out as a pamphlet for 
readers over here. You will hardly have the time for this task, 
even if you neglect Dana for a while. In which case I shall have to 
give it to Jones. The payment for translation is £1 per sheet. 
Here I have made the acquaintance of Colonel Szerelmey, who 
is a very cultivated man. In Hungary he took part in 17 battles. 
Since he is also a first-rate painter, he is now bringing out a 
magnificent work, with battle reports in the text, and battle 
illustrations. He himself did the sketches, which were finished off 
by leading French painters. He has promised me a copy. Each will 
cost £10. So you will receive an addition to your military library.

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 12 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 16 April 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
Yesterday received your letter of 30 (?) March, together with the 
account of the revolutionary assembly.106  I note that you have 
begun to stamp your letters, which is nonsensical; this CONCERN, id 
est Messieurs Ermen & Engels, can pay the postage. The things 
have been sent on to Marx. 
The day before yesterday I arrived back here from London, 
where I had spent Easter. Marx's youngest child" was very ill and, 
as I now learn from him,b has since died—the second already in 
London. As you can imagine, his wife is greatly afflicted by it. 
There has also been some illness in Freiligrath's family, but things 
are going better there. 
Dronke, as you will know, was arrested on his way through 
Paris.  It was partly his own fault for, despite his earlier expulsion, 
the little man had lingered there for 3 weeks. Now he writes to say 
that he has been removed from the Mazas prison and taken back 
to the Préfecture de Police, to be sent to Boulogne and England 
on Good Friday evening. But up till now we have heard nothing 
more of him. The little man shows a remarkable talent for 
constantly getting  INTO  MISCHIEF,  but no doubt he will turn up one of 
these days. Then the whole of the N. Rh. Z. will be in England, 
for Weerth, though he is in Hamburg again just now, still has 
connection with Bradford and, no matter how he struggles, will 
always find himself cast up there again. 
It seems probable that our Cologne friends0 will appear before 
the Court of Assizes in May, since the Board of indicting 
magistrates was expected to have decided their case by Monday, 
5 April, and will certainly not have discharged them. This is just 
as well; the public prosecutor would immediately have appealed 
against an acquittal. If a certain Hansen of Cologne, a working 
man, should arrive in New York, treat him according to his 
deserts. The fellow, a member of the League since 1848,

administered, i.e. drank, the monies collected for the prisoners 
before absconding to America. 
In the camp of the National Loaners there is considerable 
dissatisfaction with Reichenbach, the treasurer, for keeping so 
tight a hold on the purse-strings, since in any case more money 
has already been spent than can decently be accounted for and, as 
a well-to-do and respectable citizen, he is faced with the ominous 
prospect of the forthcoming audit. Hence Kinkel and Willich are 
furious, but to no effect: Kinkel must return to his tutoring and 
now, as in the past, Willich is begging and borrowing with an 
impudence hitherto found only among Polish patriots. Thus, 
throughout the noble émigré alliance, the most glorious confusion 
reigns and, if the Guarantors' Congress takes place, or has already 
taken place, things will come to a very pretty pass. Löwe of Calbe 
and the rest of the Frankfurters 3 are now also at daggers 
drawn with Kinkel, 'a chap with whom one can but compromise 
oneself. 
Has Teilering got his statement into any of the papers? 107 Voilà 
ce qu'il nous importe de savoir b for, if so, Marx can attack it. We 
would, by the way, be very glad if Dana would send us copies of 
Marx's articles 0; we have only had the first 6 and should be glad to 
have the following ones. If Dana pleads too much work, the best 
thing would be for you to get hold of them yourself and send 
them here. Marx has long been meaning to write to you about 
this, but just now is probably not in a state to turn his thoughts 
to it. See what you can do, for we must have a complete set 
here;  later on that sort of thing will also be important as a docu­
ment. 
My strategical articled is no longer any good and is all the less 
suitable for a collection 108 as the essentials were not really in it, but 
in my letter to you.e So do not hesitate to file it away. As soon as I 
have time to work undisturbed and some prospect of publication, 
I shall send you articles on the development of commerce and on 
the present state of the English industrial bourgeoisie.17 For the 
present I must spend the next fortnight or 3 weeks exclusively on 
the study of Russian and Sanscrit, in which I am now engaged'; 
later, when my material arrives from Germany, I shall turn to 
a former deputies to the Frankfurt National Assembly of 1848-49 - b That is what

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 20 April 1852 
Dear Marx, 
I was grieved to see that my fears concerning your little 
daughter have been all too soon confirmed. If only there were 
some means by which you and your family could move into a 
more salubrious district and more spacious lodgings! 
I would gladly have sent you some money, but while in 
London109  I spent so much more than I had anticipated that I 
shall be pretty short myself until the end of the month, and next 
month I shall have to pay out at once £12 in bills and for books 
ordered from Germany. But I shall see if I can get hold of 
something for you by the beginning of May. I wish I had known 
beforehand how things stood in London, for in that case I should 
have foregone what was au fond'  a quite superfluous trip there, 
and my hands would not have been quite so tied. 
Pindar is here, having failed to find employment in Liverpool. 
He is looking for a position or for private lessons and I shall, of 
course, do what I can for him. As a token that I am well disposed 
towards him I have been taking Russian lessons from him. But if I 
am to recommend him here, I must know something more about 
him, and since such intelligence can only be dragged out of him 
with the utmost difficulty, I should be glad if you would write and 
tell me what you know about him and his circumstances, how you

became acquainted with him, etc., etc. With his taciturn manner, 
by the way, it doesn't seem to me as though he'll be lucky here. 
In considering the present state of commerce, particularly as 
regards India, there is one point that should not be overlooked.11 
Despite 3 years of colossal and ever-increasing imports of English 
industrial goods into India, the news from there has for some time 
been moderately good again, stocks are gradually being sold and 
are fetching higher prices. The reason for this can only be that, in 
the provinces most lately conquered by the English, Sind, the 
Punjab, etc., etc., where native handicrafts have hitherto almost 
exclusively predominated, these are now finally being crushed by 
English competition, either because the manufacturers here have 
only recently come round to producing materials suitable for these 
markets, or because the NATIVES have finally sacrificed their 
preference for local cloths in favour of the cheaper price of the 
English materials usually exported to India. The last Indian crisis 
of 1847 and the concomitant sharp DEPRECIATION of English products 
in India may have contributed greatly to this; and it is already 
clear from old Gülich that even the parts of India occupied by 
the English in his day had not for a long time completely 
abandoned their traditional domestic manufactures. b This is the 
only explanation for the fact that the 1847 affair has not long 
since recurred in more acute form in Calcutta and Bombay. But 
all this will be changed once the 3,000,000 bales of cotton from 
the last crop have come onto the market, been processed and con­
signed as finished goods, predominantly to India. The cotton 
industry is now so flourishing that, despite this season's crop, 
which is 300,000 bales more than that of 1848/49, cotton prices 
are rising both here and in America, that American manufactur­
ers have already bought 250,000 bales more than last year (when 
they used in all only 418,000 bales), and that manufacturers here 
are already beginning to maintain that even a crop of 3 million 
bales would be insufficient for their needs. Up till now, America 
has exported 174,000 bales more to England, 56,000 more to 
France and 27,000 more to the rest of the Continent than she did 
last year. (Each season runs from 1 Sept. to 7 April.)c And, given 
prosperity of this order, it is of course easy to explain how Louis 
Napoleon can prepare at leisure for his bas-empireno; the surplus

of direct cotton imports into France between 1850 and 1852 now 
amounts to 110,000 bales (302,000 against 192,000), i.e. more than 
33%. 
According to all the rules the crisis should come this year and 
will, indeed, probably do so; but if one takes into consideration the 
present quite unexpected resilience of the Indian market, the 
confusion created by California and Australia, the cheapness of 
most raw materials, which also means cheap industrial manufac­
tures,  and the absence of any heavy speculation, one is almost 
tempted to forecast that the present period of prosperity will be of 
exceptionally long duration. At any rate it may well be that the 
thing will last until the spring. But WITHIN  SIX MONTHS  MORE  OR LESS it is, 
after all, safest to stick to the old rule.

... The chief industry, the cotton industry, is doing more 
splendidly than ever.3  Despite the fact that the present cotton crop 
exceeds that of 1848/49 by 300,000 bales, cotton prices are rising 
both here and in America, so that American manufacturers have

one hand this prosperity explains how Louis Bonaparte can 
prepare at leisure for his bas-empire. The surplus of direct cotton 
imports into France between 1850 and 1852 now amounts to 
110,000 bales—302,000 against 192,000, i.e. more than 33%. On 
the other hand, it explains the flaccid condition of politics in this 
country. Given such prosperity, the Tories cannot, for their part, 
compete with the 'blessings of  FREE  TRADE', even though they are at 
the helm, while the FREE TRADERS for their part refrain from 
provoking political agitation because, so long as business is 
flourishing, the manufacturers do not want political upheavals and 
disturbances. The thriving state of the cotton industry is due 
chiefly to the Indian market, whence there has been good news 
for some time past—despite continuing colossal imports from 
England. This may be explained by the fact that in the territories 
most lately conquered by the English, Sind, the Punjab, etc., where 
native handicrafts have hitherto almost exclusively predominated, 
these are now finally being crushed by English competition. The 
last Indian crisis of 1847 and the concomitant sharp  DEPRECIATION  of 
English products in India may have contributed to this. This 
unexpected resilience of the Indian market, California, Australia, 
as well as the cheapness of most raw materials in the absence of 
any heavy speculation, give reason to suppose that the period of 
prosperity will be of exceptionally long duration. It may well be

You cannot imagine what a wretched time I had last week. On the

some French neighbours in order to pay the English vultures. And

revelations about 'the armies' will make you laugh. If you are 
going to send me articles for Dana now, wait until you have 
several so that I can send them all off at once. 
Mr Tellering is publishing a monthly or weekly in New York; 
the cur himself sent me the first issue—unadulterated third-form 
drivel. 
Heise (of the Hornisse) is now an intimate of Willich's. They are 
as thick as thieves. What can he see in the fellow? Once again they 
are bragging about a proposed coup in Germany. 
Dronke is a real imbécile. His appetite whetted by the £4 we got 
for him from the Rhineland, he went to Coblenz in the hopes 
of extorting some more. It never occurred to the jackass that 
he would be providing fresh ammunition for use against the 
people in Cologne. 3 The fellow's behaviour is really too dis­
graceful. 
Apropos. Do not forget to send immédiatement two notes to 
London as follows: 1. for Liebknecht, empowering him to obtain 
the £1 from Hain. 2. Write a brief note yourself to Hain, telling 
your 'good friend' in a couple of lines that, having heard he was 
doing well, you had referred Liebknecht to him re the £1. We 
must be careful not to make an enemy of him. 
The fact is that one of our acquaintances, who has hither­
to found shelter for the night at Liebknecht's lodgings, was 
thrown out by the latter's landlords, and not one of us has 
been able to raise a penny for the poor devil. Accordingly I 
yesterday sent Liebknecht a note in which I told him you had 
referred him to Hain re the £1. Mr Hain appeared somewhat in­
credulous and told Liebknecht he must first see it in your hand­

an astonished world that the continental armies are there to 
maintain internal peace. Mr Bruno still represents the Hegelian 
dialectic in its deepest stagnation. At this stage of development, his 
concept of history goes no deeper than providing circumstantial 
proof of the most banal platitudes by an ample display of 
solemnity and pseudo-logical development, and then dishing them 
up as the brand-new findings of zealous research. All this is 
tolerable in the case of the distant past, but to be thus bamboozled 
about the immediate present is really too much and any fool 
should be able to see that there's nothing at all at the bottom of it. 
And as for the profound truth that governments are right vis-à-
vis revolutions because the latter are still immature, but 
revolutions are also right vis-à-vis governments because 
they represent the ideas of the future, admittedly in embryonic 
and immature form, but nevertheless [...] to a substantial 
degree—that is an old Hegelian joke whose novelty has certainly 
worn off even in America! And then the eternal 'ill-temper', 
'peevishness', 'fundamental indifference' of the 'bourgeois'. 'In 
some countries, classes war against classes, in others nations 
against nations.' Strictly speaking, this prodigiously clever sentence 
is all that Bruno has learnt from the revolution.

Unless you know positively that Dronke went to Germany of his 
own free will, I would think it more probable that, having been 
already once expelled from France, he was this time transported 
not to any frontier but to the German frontier. But once safely in 
Nassau, why did the silly fool go to Coblenz when he'd have done 
far better to go to Hamburg, where no one knows him and he 
would have found Weerth and Strohn, hence also cash, and from 
there to England! But Coblenz being so close, he was obviously 
drawn there from Nassau by the prospect of money, and if he had 
managed to get through safely, would certainly have gone on to 
Cologne. At all events, it is fortunate for the Cologne people that 
they have already been dealt with by the Board of indicting 
magistrates, otherwise Dronke's arrest would have provided 
occasion for another six months' examination. But very soon 
they'll take him to Cologne and maybe attempt to produce him as 
a witness before the Court of Assizes. This time it serves him 
perfectly right. He could certainly have found such money as he 
needed in Frankfurt, or have got Lassalle to send it to him 
somewhere, but no, the little chap must needs go to Coblenz 
where he's known to every gendarme and every dog in town. En 
attendant il est sûrement logé. 3

Voilà donc3  Moses Hess, in the Kölnische Zeitung, with a warrant 
out against him for high treason. b I'll be hanged if this hasn't

shortly be dispatched to London— est-ce que nous n'échapperons

extremely awkward again for the poor devils in Cologne and

Manchester, 29 April 1852 
D. M., 
Herewith another letter from Weydemeyer. I have not received 
the newspapers; but the Atlantic was reported by telegraph this 
morning, and they will probably arrive tomorrow morning. 
Weydemeyer appears to have misunderstood one or two practical 
hints I gave him on how to pack and dispatch his things in such a 
way as not to pay unnecessarily high postal charges; however, I 
have already pointed out his mistake. 3 
So the Coblenz story about the piccolo b was a pure fabrication 
and, if the Kölner Zeitung is to be believed, Father Dronke must 
already be in London, his adventures have achieved a purpose. 
Tant mieux pour lui. c But this makes the business of Moses'd 
warrant even more inexplicable. Anyhow, it would seem to imply 
further vexations for the Cologne people. God knows what sort of 
scrawl the police have picked up this time. Pauvre* Moses, fancy 
becoming so EGREGIOUSLY and post festum* a martyr in partibus 
infideliuml 
Next week I shall write several articles in succession for Dana, 118 
and make sure that I take the thing up to the end of the Imperial 
Constitutional campaign. In order that we may be able to conclude 
directly, it would be a good idea if you could provide me with a 
short memorandum for the final  articles—THE  REVOLUTIONARY  PROS­
PECTS  OF GERMANY, and our party's situation during and after the 
revolution. It is precisely these concluding pieces which are 
important, and moreover a memorandum of this kind would 
enable me to write these articles not only better but far more 
quickly. In this way I could, if I tried hard enough, finish all the 
5-6 outstanding articles within a fortnight and meanwhile you 
could get in touch with Dana about a new series on a subject of 
greater actualité, soit la France, soit l'Angleterre. 9 Since Weydemeyer's 
pamphlet will probably be coming out soon, it will no longer be

possible to sell Dana the 18th Brumaire, even in a different guise; 
for he will then be able to have it FOR NOTHING and translate it 
himself.  But you could still ask Dana whether he would like to 
have a modified version in translation, one suitable for the 
Anglo-American public. In this case the events leading up to 
2 December '51 would for the most part be excised and the thing 
finally brought right up to date, so that successive weekly or 
fortnightly reports on France would follow straight on.

IN MANCHESTER 
London, 30 April 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
You will receive at the same time as this letter a colossal parcel 
from America. Today I have also had a letter from Cluss, of which 
I give excerpts below, as I shall be needing it until next week. 
Dronke has arrived here sain et  sauf*  I like him better than I 
had feared. He has grown taller and has broadened out as well. 
This has also made him more self-possessed. For the present he 
hob-nobs with Anschütz, who welcomed him with open arms. He 
is going to start up a small business, having contracted in Paris to 
sell cigar cases and purses over here. 10% commission. And, 
through Anschütz, he will at once acquire the necessary connec­
tions for this TRADE. 
He tells me that the 'worthy' Techow has sent character sketches 
of us to Switzerland in which he roundly inveighs against us and 
a safe and sound

you in particular. You have aroused the professional jealousy of 
the military, et je pense* that one day you will justify leurs 
pressentiments^ Further: from Geneva, Schily demanded that the 
gentlemen come to terms with us. This elicited an authoritative 
statement signed by Willich, Techow, Schapper and Schim­
melpfennig in which, inter alia, it was pointed out that 1. there 
had been a complete break with this wholly impotent party; 
2. there are police spies in our midst who have been reporting 
everything to the Prussian government. 
I don't know whether I have already told you, or whether you 
heard during your stay here,119  that Messrs Kinkel et Co. possess a 
mere 3,000 dollars in cash all  told,  that all respectable people such 
as Löwe of Calbe have all withdrawn, that relations between 
Willich on the one hand and Kinkel and Reichenbach on the other 
are very strained, and that the whole dungheap is in process of 
disintegration. 
You will receive the memorandum on Germany." 
Yesterday the curs held a meeting of guarantors here and 
elected a definitive committee. Mr Ruge wrote a letter of protest. 
Willich was not present. From the start Reichenbach refused to 
have anything more to do with the filthy business. The committee 
will be paid. Those elected are Kinkel, Willich (doubtful that he'll 
accept), Löwe of Calbe (will in any case refuse), Fickler, Ronge, 
Schütz of Mainz and one other. They will make up the total from 
out of their own midst. In his letter, Ruge attacks Kinkel as an 
agent of the Prince of Prussia d and a freemason. 
Here is a passage from CIuss' letter: 
Huzel (not to be confused with Huzzelwitt), Cluss' friend, 
[present as a guarantor] at Kinkel's Cincinnati congress60 writes 
and tells Cluss inter alia: 
'Kinkel tried to floor me with vulgar invective against Marx and Engels. I 
succeeded in doing what I wanted, namely in cornering him so effectively that I 
shall have him at my mercy for some time to come. He tried to cover himself by 
obtaining my word of honour not to say anything about the incident or to write 
anything that would get him "into a stink"... In a letter to Anneke a certain 
Teilering scolds like a fishwife at Marx...'. 
Cluss himself goes on: 
'In New York, at the inimitable meeting which I reported in my last letter, the 
numerous gymnastic clubs 120 constituted themselves a separate body and declared 
a and I think - b their presentiments - c See this volume, p. 90. - d  Cf. this 
volume, p. 573.

their support for my protest3 and for Weydemeyer's article against Kinkel's 
memorandum!121 
Apropos. I gave Bangya a few pen-sketches of the great German 
men in London for him to pass on to Szemere.122  This letter, I 
know not how, has been read to a German publisher without my 
name being mentioned. He is now asking for 'character sketches' 
of these gentlemen and, according to Bangya, is prepared to pay 
£25 for a few sheets. Anonymous or pseudonymous, of course. 
Well, qu'en penses-tu7 c We would really have to do a humorous 
piece of this kind together. I have some doubts. If you think I 
should take this crap on, you will have to make a compilation from 
my letters and anything else you have which may contain 
fragments on the peculiarities of these curs. At all events you 
would have to send me a few notes about Willich 'in action' 123 and 
'in Switzerland'. 
Among the things I am sending you, you will find the draft of 
an advertisement for an illustrated book of battle reports by old 
Szerelmey. He wants it gingered up a little and done into English 
as an advertisement, in return for which he promises each of us a 
copy of his work. Je crois que ça vaut la peine de faire un petit  puff. d 
As soon as I set eyes on Mr Carey's first work in print 6 I 
foresaw that he would bring out an economic work on the 
'harmony of interests'.' 
Mais que dis-tu, mon cher,e  to the fact that, in the Janus we sent 
you, Ruge seeks—and how he seeks, mon Dieu! —to appropriate 
communism as the latest product of his 'humanist thought'. 
Have you read the cock-fight between Harney and Jones? U6 If 
not, I shall send you their mutual philippics.11 Both of them, the 
one voluntarily, the other involuntarily, descend to the level of 
German emigre polemics.

Have you ever read more egregious nonsense than B. Bauer's 
article in the Tribune: 'The Decline of England'? The passage most 
characteristic of the incorrigible old theologian runs as follows: 
'While the English Parliament has hitherto persecuted the Romish policy, and 
availed itself of the popular impulses for the establishment of its sovereignty— 
while, in the old Romish spirit, it has taken advantage of internal domestic differences, 
as for example, the differences of High Church, of  Scotch  Presbyterianism, and of Irish 
Catholicism, for the formation and development of its aristocratic art of 
Government, [...] it has now become a party to the Continental struggle between 
the peoples and the Governments, and it appears as the advocate for Con­
stitutionalism at the very moment when that is approaching its undeniable 
downfall.' 
If that's not champion drivel, I don't know what is.

MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER12

London, 30 April 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
The news of the printing is very welcome.124 You must not take 
Lupus' letter125  so much au sérieux? In our very straitened 
circumstances there is, you know, inevitably a surplus of irritation 
which must always be 'discounted' if one is to strike a right 
balance. 
Neither I nor Engels has received your anti-Kinkel article in the 
Turn-Zeitung}' I await it with keen interest since your anti-Heinzen 
polemic was a model of its kind. c 
I am horrified to learn that Pfänder's statements are appearing 
in the pamphlet. 126 That sort of thing is all very well for a weekly 
where what crops up today is submerged tomorrow in the welter 
of time. In a pamphlet, on the other hand, it acquires altogether

too much permanence, looks too much like a party manifesto and, 
if we want to attack the swine, there are, of course, better and 
different ways of doing so than in Pfänder's statement. Unfortu­
nately this will arrive too late.— Just now I am negotiating with a 
bookseller here who is to get your Revolution sent to Germany. 
More about this next week. 
As regards the newly invented lacquer varnish about which I 
and Bangya wrote to you,127 you must not let the thing out of your 
own hands. It might set you up in funds at one stroke. Write and 
tell me when the EXHIBITION opens in New York,128  and all you know 
about it. You can make use of the opportunity both to strike up 
acquaintances and to establish all the connections with foreign 
businessmen necessary to a forwarding agency. Write to me at 
once,  giving full details of the expenses you thereby incur. We 
must, of course, let you have these en avance. In the first place you 
will need a fellow to keep a constant eye on the stuff at the 
Exhibition, since you yourself cannot spend the whole day in the 
building for the sake of it. Secondly, you will need money for 
advertisements and announcements in the newspapers. So let us 
have a detailed estimate of expenses. 
As to Szemere, his pamphlet3 will soon be READY. But since I 
cannot, as he asks, send him a 'bundle' of copies of the Revolution, 
and since our enemies may have whispered in his ear that your 
paper has appeared only twice before submerging again, I cannot 
just now get any money from that quarter, for the confidence of 
these people has been shaken. But he is coming here in person and 
I shall then straighten everything out. 
It would be a pity if your anti-Kinkel polemic were not to 
appear in the very first number. The fellow is going utterly to pot. 
A Dane by the name of Goldschmidt lampooned him splendidly in 
the feuilleton of the Kölner Zeitung, recounting his meeting with 
him and Schurz in London. b Dronke, finally released from custody 
in Paris, has arrived here and is saying that in private friend 
Schurz declares Kinkel a jackass whom he only intends to exploit. 
This man, Kinkel's 'modest liberator', has smuggled an article into 
the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung" in which he proclaims himself

'the only important man among the London émigrés', declares 
Kinkel and Ruge to be 'out-moded' and, in proof of his own 
greatness, cites the fact that he is marrying a 'rich' girl, Ronge's 
sister-in-law, and that, after completion of the nuptials, he will 
remove to America. Quel grand homme! Quant à Tellering" keep me 
au fait about this individual. As soon as I think fit, I can destroy 
him, not only in the eyes of our party, but in the eyes of all 
parties. 1" 
Yesterday, then, Mr Kinkel held his Guarantors' Congress. c Mr 
Willich did not appear; he is very embittered with Kinkel as a 
result of the news which we conveyed to him by a roundabout 
route (we had had it from Cluss). Mr Ruge sent a letter in which 
he declared Kinkel to be an agent of the 'King of Prussia'/ and 
gave himself superior airs. Mr Reichenbach declared that he 
wanted to have nothing more to do with the filthy business. Thus 
a definitive committee was elected, seven in number—of the 
alleged communists only Willich, who is unlikely to accept. In 
addition, Löwe of Calbe, who has already refused. Next, Kinkel, 
Schütz of Mainz, Fickler. I do not know who the other two are. 
According to some reports, the curs have 3,000 dollars in cash 
and, according to others, 9,000. They immediately resolved that 
the 7 members of the provisional government should receive payment, 
a fact you must report in the Turn-Zeitung. 129 For the rest, the 
whole dungheap is disintegrating. 
Keep at least some of the copies of the Revolution READY for 
Germany until you receive my order. 
I have forwarded your letter to Jones. He cannot possibly pay 
anything. He is as dépourvu* as ourselves, and we all write for him 
gratis.  Cluss will have told you about the battle between Jones and 
Harney. I have sent him details of it. 130 However, the things must 
be kept from the American Press for as long as possible. 
Big business and industry are now doing better than ever in 
England and hence on the Continent. As a result of the 
exceptional circumstances—California, Australia, England's com­
mercial penetration of the Punjab, Sind and other only recently 
conquered parts of India, it may well be that the crisis will be 
postponed until 1853. But then its eruption will be appalling. And 
until that time there can be no thought of revolutionary 
convulsions.

Enclosed a 30/- POST OFFICE ORDER, which is all I can spare for the 
moment. True, you will not be able to cash the thing tomorrow, 
on account of its being Sunday, but at least you know that you've 
got it. Should I find myself able to send off more of the same later

idea for an alphabetically arranged collection of such biographies, 
which could continually be added to and kept in readiness for the 
great moment 'when it all starts', and then they could all at once be 
precipitated into the world. As for the publisher's offer, £25 is not 
to be sneezed at, but we must not forget that, however great the 
ano-  and pseudonymity, everyone will realise de quel côté  ces flèches 
viennent* and the responsibility would be laid at both our doors. If 
published in Germany under the present regime, the thing would 
seem to be supporting the reactionaries, and not even prefaces 
expressing the most irreproachable views in the world would make 
it seem otherwise. And that is always fatal. If the affair were 
restricted to a few—say, a dozen—of the more noteworthy 
jackasses, Kinkel, Hecker, Struve, Willich, Vogt and so forth, it 
might be more feasible, for the omission of our own names would 
not then matter very much and the things could be taken as 
issuing direct from the reactionaries. At any rate we ought, if 
possible, to write it together. 131 So decide what you think is best

is no parcel for me. Either you didn't send the thing off or, if by 
post, perhaps not in the prescribed manner, or else something has 
happened to it. So try and find out what has become of the thing. 
I shall be having a visit from my respected pater here this week, 
when the whole bloody matter of the firm will be settled and my 
position, too, will be further regulated. Either the contract will be 
renewed and the firm will continue as it is, which is not very

Liverpool or God knows what. This will probably be decided

I can acquaint myself with both sides and observe Father Harney 
in his new role. The industrious Jones will soon drive this indolent 
cur from the field if only he can hang on for a while. And he will 
certainly be able to raise the circulation3 to 4,000 a week, which 
alone means a profit (3,600 covers costs). 
The arrival of my old man will, of course, put back my Dana 
plans b by a week or a fortnight. On the other hand you could 
meanwhile continue, through Szemere, to negotiate with the 
publisher over the sketches, to look through your correspondence 
and the JV. Rh. Z. (especially votes and speeches in the National 
Assembly) apropos the heroes to be depicted and, if the matter 
reaches a favourable conclusion, you could come up here for a 
week and we'd have a go at the thing. c I really think it could be 
done in such a way that no one will discover its paternité, 0 and even 
if they did, little harm would be done.

28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
The parcel didn't go off to you because Pickford's demanded 
2/6d from my wife. And the whole lot put together isn't worth 
that much. 
The strange note enclosed herewith is a hastily made copy of a 
circular sent out by Messrs Kinkel and Willich to their affiliates. 132 
The funniest thing about it is that one of their heads of sections 
invariably carries these scraps to Hebeler, the Prussian Consul-
General, who pays him for them. The Prussian government, of 
course, no less than Kinkel-Willich, possesses the key to these

portentous mysteries. Indeed Willich, for all his principles and 
scruples, has after all accepted a position on the definitive 
committee. Where the money is, there you will find Willich. 
A coup quelconque3  is intended, so much is certain. General 
Klapka has already left for Malta, in his pocket a commission 
signed by Kossuth and Mazzini appointing him general command­
ing the Italo-Hungarian army. I believe a start is to be made in 
Sicily. Unless these gentlemen suffer defeat and receive a 
drubbing twice a year, they feel ill at ease. That world history 
continues to unfold without their help, without their intervention, 
and without, indeed, official intervention, is something they refuse 
to admit. If things go wrong, as they are sure to do, Mr Mazzini 
will have a renewed opportunity for self-assertion in outraged 
letters to a Graham quelconque^ 133 Nor will his digestion suffer in 
consequence. 
I am now correcting Bangya's translation of Szemere's character-
sketches' written in Hungarian. While the original must be 
splendid, it has to be laboriously reconstructed from the wretched 
and often almost incomprehensible translation which is constantly 
at loggerheads with the rules of grammar and the consecutio 
temporum? This much is clear: the deposition of the Austrian 
dynasty which, at the time of its proclamation, was unpolitical and 
pernicious, was engineered by Mr Lajos Kossuth so as to secure 
for himself the post of governor, for he feared that, if he 
hesitated, he would later see it devolve unopposed on the 
victorious Görgey. Lajos was also responsible for the mistake of 
storming Ofen instead of marching on Vienna, since he was 
itching to celebrate with his family his triumphant entry into the 
capital. 134 
Apropos. I have just received a letter from Bangya. The 
publisher in Berlin has now made a definite offer: £25 for 5-6 
sheets of character-sketches, 24 free copies. I shall receive the 
money from Bangya as soon as I deliver the manuscript to him. 
But the man wants it quickly. 
My plan is as follows: for the time being I shall do a brouillon" 
with Dronke, which will plus ou moins 1 obliterate my style. So it 
might be possible for you and me to get the thing g READY  in a

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 7 May 1852 
Dear Marx, 
I return Cluss' letter herewith. In this connection it has occurred 
to me that now that Mr Dana is in touch with B. Bauer and Simon 
of Trier and is, at the same time, restricting your space on account 
of the presidential election, it would certainly not be out of place 
to give Mr Dana a taste of Yankee medicine. Cluss and a number 
of others should write to Mr Dana from various quarters inquiring 
why it is that these INCOMPARABLE articles should appear so rarely 
and irregularly and expressing the hope that the fault does not lie 
with the editorial board which, rather, might be expected to 
correct this situation and find it possible to publish articles by 
K. M. more frequently, etc., etc. Weydemeyer could very easily 
organise this; the only reason we need to give him is that Dana 
wants to restrict your soace and hence a demonstration of this 
a Willich's service in the Baden-Palatinate insurgent army in the spring of 
1849.  - b The issue of Die Revolution, in which Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte appeared.

A Barnum, Barnum et demi. 7" If you agree, I can put this to 
Weydemeyer per the next STEAMER. 
The circular sent out by the convention to the sections is 
exquisite. I'll be hanged if the St Petersburg, Warsaw, Berlin, 
Rome, etc., sections are situated more than 4 miles from Charing 
Cross.  This carbonari-like, self-important, bustling, order-of-the-
dayish attitude again betrays how mistaken these gentlemen are as 
to their ostensibly organised forces. To propose a coup just now is 
a bêtise b and a dirty trick. But truly, 'something has got to happen, 
something has got to be done'. It would be desirable for the 
supposed leaders of the thing to be all of them captured and shot; 
but needless to say the great men will make sure this doesn't 
happen and the heroic Willich will stay quietly in London so long 
as there is still money in the cashbox, credit at Schärttner's and 
free coats and boots ad libitum at the 'tailor's and shoemaker's'. 
That is what Mr Willich means by supplies for the army! 
As for the matter of the character-sketches,0  so far so good. The 
thing can be ready in a month's time. But mind you find someone 
reliable to make a fair copy, so that it goes out in a completely 
unknown hand. When you come up, bring the Americana, the 
complete run of the JV. Rh. Z. and the necessary manuscript 
documents. My old man arrives tomorrow and is unlikely to be 
able to stay here for longer than 8-10 days. 
I've at last received my stuff on military science from Germany. 
So far I have been able to read only little of it. At this stage, I 
should say that Mr Gustav von Hoffstetter, of wide renown, is not 
exactly a Napoleon but rather a thoroughly reliable commander of 
a battalion or so in a minor engagement. But I haven't yet finished 
reading his thing/ 1 Not unpleasing, on the other hand, is a booklet 
on new fortifications in general by Küntzel, a Prussian captain of 
engineers e—both better history and more materialist than any­
thing I have so far read in militaribus.1 
Now as for Mr Willisen, be it said here that the victory at 
Idstedt135  was won, not by the Danes over the Schleswig-
Holsteiners, but rather by the usual tactics of common sense over

Hegelian speculation. Willisen's book3  should really be called the 
philosophy of great wars. This in itself would indicate that it 
contains more philosophising than military science, that the most 
self-evident things are construed a priori with the most profound 
and exhaustive thoroughness and that, sandwiched between these, 
are the most methodical discourses on simplicity and multiplicity 
and such-like opposites. What can one say about military science 
which begins with the concept of art en general, then goes on to 
demonstrate that the art of cookery is also an art, expatiates on 
the relationship of art to science and finally subsumes all the rules, 
relationships, potentialities, etc., etc., of the art of war under the 
one, absolute axiom: the stronger always overcomes the weaker. 
Every now and again there are some nice aperçus h and some useful 
reductions to basic principles; it would indeed be bad if there were 
not. As to its practical application, I haven't yet got to that, but it 
doesn't say much for Willisen that every one of Napoleon's 
greatest victories was achieved in defiance of Willisen's elementary 
rules,  a result that your orthodox Hegelian can, of course, readily 
explain away without the least violence being done to those rules. 
I see that Görgey's memoirs have just come out r—but since they 
cost 6 talers, I doubt that I can buy them just now. With these, the 
material on the military aspect of the Hungarian war may be 
regarded as complete for the time being. At any rate, I shall do 
something on the Hungarian war, and possibly on all the wars of 
1848/49. ' 6 As soon as I am clear in my mind about earlier military 
history, I shall look round for a publisher onto whom I can then 
shift most of the expenditure on sources.

IN WASHINGTON 
[London, 7 and about 15 May 1852] 
... Herewith you will find a wrapper, in which the contemptible, 
craven, half-crazed Teilering mailed his defamatory opus. (Ad­
dress:) CHARLES MARX, THE FUTURE DICTATOR OF GERMANY. 1 8 Now I ask 
you, what is to be done with the cur? To start a public row with a 
lunatic of this sort would be doing him too much honour and is 
the whole object of his manoeuvre. Could you not send the 
MANIACS wrapper to the New York postal service in my name? Or 
might not a sound thrashing be the simplest course? I leave the 
whole thing to you. Naturally any packages of the kind will in 
future be returned. But by indulging in this sort of gutter-snipe's 
trick, the cur also brings me to the notice of the English police, 
which, under the Tories, is far from pleasant... 
Ad vocem* Szemere: I am not by nature inclined to be unduly 
trusting, least of all when it comes to the official great men of 
1848/49. But in Szemere's case, it's quite a different matter. I am 
correcting the German translation—for he originally wrote in 
Hungarian—of his 'character-sketches'.11  Every line betrays a 
superior intellect, and the rage of the democrats may be attributed 
to the CONTEMPT AND MOCKERY-SYSTEM which he employs with supreme 
skill. Although, of course, in accordance with the Hungarian line, 
he places, as in Antiquity, 'the fatherland and the citizen' above all 
else,  his writing is imbued with a fundamentally critical spirit. A 
man who thinks and writes in this way is no Austrian agent. As for 
the 'DEAR COLONEL WEBB', he was negotiating with him without 
knowing who he was, but broke off as soon as he was informed 
what was afoot. The story of his fortune is very simple. Szemere 
himself does not possess a centime. But his wife is the daughter of 
a (now deceased) Austrian 'Hof-agent' (as the Austrian Procureurs 
du roic are called in Hungary); her old man possessed a fortune of 
a million. Throughout the 1848/49 revolution Mrs Szemere lived 
in Vienna with her mother. He had even ordered her to refrain 
from writing to him and to sever all ties with him until the old

woman's death, when she could collect her fortune. His old 
mother-in-law died at the end of 1849 and Mrs Szemere, who was, 
of course, in no way suspect, surreptitiously sold all her 
worldly goods and turned them into CASH. In this she was 
aided by the minister, Bach, her father's lawyer, who seized on this 
opportunity and surreptitiously took his cut. Once her fortune was 
liquid, Mrs Szemere converted it into bills on London and English 
STOCKS, obtained a passport authorising her to visit the water-cure 
doctor, Priessnitz, in Prussia, but instead travelled to London and 
thence to her husband in Paris. Those Austrians, however, could 
lay their hands on nothing with which to gladden their Exchequer. 
Well, what does all this prove? That Szemere is much too astute to 
make his enemies a present of a million. I have written to Sz. 
himself,  telling him that, without mentioning Kossuth, he should 
make a statement about his personal circumstances which I shall 
get into the New-York Tribune for him. 
The Austrian spies are in Kossuth's immediate entourage, 
notably Madame Pulszky. This Count Pulszky is a Galician Jew by 
origin. Madame Pulszky, daughter of an ultra-reactionary Jewish 
banker in Vienna, writes to her mater each week, and from this 
source the Austrian government finds out anything it wants. It 
may even be asked whether Count and Countess Pulszky (The 
Times regularly derided both these individuals for the ASSUMPTION 
of their title)a have not promised to lure Mr Kossuth into the 
snare in the hope that they may thereby retrieve their confiscated 
land. It is known for a fact that as a student, Pulszky denounced 
his comrades' demagogic activities 139 to the Austrian government... 
Enclosed you will find General Klapka's declaration of princi­
ples, 140 from which you will see that he, too, is starting to rebel 
against Kossuth. The last part of the document means nothing 
more than that Klapka is going to participate in Mazzini's 
projected coup. I have, if I am not mistaken, already written to 
you about the plans for a coup hatched by Messrs Mazzini, 
Kossuth, etc. Nothing could be more welcome to the great powers, 
especially Bonaparte, and nothing more damaging to ourselves. 
I have just received a letter from Cologne, dated 3 May.b  They 
are asking for 200 or 250 copies of the Brumaire. So pray ask 
Weydemeyer to send me forthwith 300 copies via Engels. At the 
same time, he should advise me of the selling price. I take it that 
he has already dispatched the 50 copies as promised... 141

'Recently Mrs Daniels was favoured yet again with a domiciliary visit in the 
certain expectation that it would yield a letter from you. The Prussian police seem

for over two months, the files have been back in the possession of the local public 
prosecutor at the Court of Appeal where, however, they seem incapable of 
deciding upon the wording of a petition to the Board of indicting magistrates. It is 
generally rumoured that the thing will be dealt with before a special Court of 
Assizes in June.* 
Apropos. Ask Weydemeyer if he has yet been to see Dana, who 
is waiting for him to pass on the information I sent him about the 
situation of the Cologne prisoners and the conduct of the Prussian 
government, before writing a LEADER on the subject.d He mustn't

Manchester, 19 May 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Les affaires vont bien. 3 Tomorrow or the day after my old man 
will be leaving again, very satisfied with his affairs. The business 
here is to be completely reorganised and will be run on a new 
basis.  I have succeeded in obtaining a rise and, as soon as the 
contracts have been signed and my old man is out of the way, the 
banknote I promised you will materialise. The best thing about all 
this is that I am signing nothing at all; my old man was wise 
enough not to trust me entirely on the political score, thus 
perhaps safeguarding himself against becoming involved through 
me in any further unpleasantness. Moreover, in this case, and 
providing certain proprieties are observed, I can arrange to be 
replaced by one of my brothers in such a way that my old man 
would lose nothing by my departure save, perhaps, a few illusions, 
and it would be I, not he, who would be making the sacrifice. Let 
me know by return how your character-sketches 1" are going. All 
these changes are going to saddle me with a fair amount of work 
for a while, so that there would seem to be no immediate prospect 
of our doing very much together, and yet I should like very much 
to see you here as soon as possible. It would therefore be good if 
you and Dronke could complete the things so far as you are able, 
after which we could polish them off here in a few evenings. And 
before you come up I would make the necessary extracts about the 
people in question (whose names you must give me) from the 
documents up here, thereby enabling us to get on quickly. It has 
just occurred to me that it would be best for you to come at 
Whitsun, i.e. on the previous Friday—the day after tomorrow 
week—when there are general HOLIDAYS here. If the weather is fine 
we can go to the Isle of Man or somewhere, and if bad we shall 
work. But mind you come on your own. I should be very glad to 
see Dronkius later on, but I have no use for him just now, and he 
would only disturb our work. 
By the way, the best thing about the new arrangement is that, as

Dear Marx, 
I am writing to you today simply to make sure you know that 
yesterday I sent direct to you by the first post 1/2 a £10 note, and 
that the 2nd half went off at the same time under cover to Lupus 
for transmission to you. I trust you have received it all right. 
There is now great ELECTIONEERING  ACTIVITY  here—two of the WHIG 
FREE TRADERS3 were put up by the Tories with the intention of 
ousting Bright and Gibson, and nothing goes on here but 
canvassing and boozing. Of course the fellows don't stand a 
chance, but it's going to cost them a mint of money. 
Three weeks ago, as I anticipated, there was a flush of 
speculation on the cotton market; but since opportunities are not 
yet sufficiently pronounced and the spinners and merchants here 
were operating against it, the thing momentarily subsided again. 
However, it will recur before very long, as soon as the whole 
weight of the American crop has been delivered. Wool, too,— 
because of the sudden ruin of the Australian sheep-farmers— 
lends itself splendidly to speculation and, all things considered, 
there is every prospect that by the autumn speculation will be in 
full spate. Railway stocks, etc., etc., are again beginning to 
rise—the better ones continue to yield more than the 1 to  1 xl%% 
now still to be had from the banks in respect of deposits. In 
America, speculation in cotton has been well under way for the 
past six weeks, and the proliferation of strange new joint-stock

Dear Frederic, 
The first half of the 10-pound note arrived this morning. 
I intend to leave here on Friday,b this time by ship to Liverpool 
and thence to Manchester. 
Apropos. Citizen Schramm0 is travelling to America via Liver­
pool. Well, the fellow proposes, or so he confides to us, to descend 
upon you on Wednesday or Thursday. You must see if you can 
give him the slip. 
Willich has had a rather nice adventure. Mrs von Brüningk, who 
provided him with free board, used to enjoy flirting with this old 
he-goat, as with the other ex-lieutenants. One day the blood 
rushes to the head of our ascetic, he makes a brutally brutish 
assault upon madame, and is ejected from the house with éclat. 
No more love! No more free board! Nous ne voulons plus de 
jouisseurs."* 
Cherval, about whose heroism before the Paris Assizes in the 
matter of the Complot allemand-français* 14S you will have heard,

manner—as it later transpired, with the connivance of the police 
to whom he betrayed everything he knew. Even the Great 
Windmillers 144 were forced to throw out the hero with whom they 
had been parading round London. 
The Cologne people have at last been referred by the Board of 
indicting magistrates to the Court of Assizes. Unless a special 
Court of Assizes is appointed, they will not appear before July.16

Dear Marx, 
If you intend to wait till Friday before leaving by boat for 
Liverpool, you won't be here till Monday evening, perhaps not till 
Tuesday morning. If you are absolutely intent on coming by sea, 
arrange to come via Hull—a boat leaves the CITY three or four 
times a week at 8 o'clock in the morning and the journey doesn't 
take so long—you would have to leave on Wednesday morning, or 
Thursday morning at the latest, the FARE to Hull being 6/6d, and 
from Hull to" here 3rd class, some seven or eight shillings. You 
must be here by Friday afternoon, so that we can leave for 
Liverpool at about 6 o'clock the same evening. The PARLIAMENTARY 
TRAIN 14° direct from London leaves too late to be any good to you on 
Friday. You can take the sea-route from Liverpool on the return 
journey.

MARX AND ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 28 May 1852 
Dear Weiwei, 
I am staying with Engels for a few days and have found your 
letter here. Today you must be content with a few lines. 
The main purpose of this letter is to inform you about three 
individuals who will be arriving in America: 
1. Heise (of the Kassel Hornisse), Willich's agent (who, unbe­
known to Kinkel with whom he is on bad terms, is seeking to 
spread Willich's renown). Apropos. Mr Willich was among the 
cavalière servante h of Baroness von Brüningk who, once a week, 
provided him, Techow, Schimmelpfennig, etc., with free board. 
The Brüningk woman is a flirtatious little woman and it amuses 
her to tease the old he-goat, who plays the ascetic. One day he 
made a direct carnal attaque upon her and was ignominiously 
shown the door. Keep an eye on Heise and don't trust him out of 
your sight. 
a whatever you do, you must be here by Friday, at four o'clock in the 
afternoon - b knights in attendance

2. Schütz from Mainz. Kinkelian. Member of the Committee for 
the Administration of the European-American National Loan. 27 
3. Conrad Schramm. He has in his hands a credential from us, so 
worded that without you he cannot take a step. In his relations with 
his brother2  and the latter' s other friends, his conduct has not 
always been beyond reproach. The confidence you accord him 
should not be unconditional but rather tempered with caution. In the 
adverse circumstances here he has, furthermore, gone very much 
downhill, is quite unreliable and not over-scrupulous in money-
matters, tends to swagger and boast like a commis voyageur b and 
hence may well compromise those in his surroundings. On the 
other hand he has a number of good qualities. I feel it my duty to 
put you au fait in advance. You should also pass on this 
information to Cluss. 
As to Lupus' letter, you should not take it too literally. Wolff 
wrote in a moment of agitation and is very well aware of the many 
obstacles that stood in your way.c 
Don't forget to send me in your next a detailed report on 
'Willich's Corps'147 in New York. 
My warm regards to your wife. I hope that, 'for all that',d your 
affairs will yet progress. 
Dana has written to say he wants to do an essay on the Cologne 
people" as soon as you provide him with the necessary informa­
tion. So go and see him. The Cologne people are to appear before 
a special Court of Assizes in June. Daniels is said to have 
consumption and Becker' to be half blind. Mind you settle the 
matter quickly with Dana and send me the article. It will provide 
consolation for Mrs Daniels.

Dear Heart, 
I was very pleased to get your letter. By the way, you must 
never have any qualms about telling me all. If you, my poor little 
wretch, have to endure bitter reality, it is only fair that I should 
share that torment, at least in my thoughts. In any case, I know 
how unendingly resilient you are and how the slightest encourage­
ment is enough to revive your spirits. I hope that the other £5 will 
reach you this week or on Monday at the latest.

unconscionable time to do one sheet. His paper is 3 x worse than 
the American, and his type likewise, this being clearly quite worn 
out. But you have managed the business splendidly.

stupidity! Be so kind as to cut Engels' article on Heinzen out of the 
Briisseler-Zeitung h and send it to us,— and that very soon. If the

Engels has further pointed out that whereas, tfiroughout the 
pamphlet, I always deliberately write 'Louis Bonaparte', Mr 
Weydemeyer has entitled it 'Louis Napoleon'. 149 
P.S. 
Dear Jenny, be so kind as to tell Eccarius that he should write a 
short postscript to his 'Mechanics' Strike',44 since Weydemeyer is 
'considering' publishing it. We should agree to this, if only on 
Cluss'  account. 
Dear Heart, send Jones the 2 enclosed pieces, 'Chevalier 
Hiilsemann's Farewell' and 'John Barney and the French Minister0', 
together with the short cutting about 'Cayenne'—preferably by 
post, unless he comes to see you.150  I beg you not to bother Mr 
Pieper with such errands. To him, everything provides occasion 
for rodomontade and I don't want Jones—who, by the way, was 
responsible for making him so uppish—to regard him as my alter 
ego. Since Pieper believes the letters are written for 'the party', he 
must not henceforward set eyes on any more of them.

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 11 June 1852 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
We have received the first issue of the Revolution,3 but we had 
imagined you would contrive to include Freiligrath's poem about 
Kinkel,b  which would not after all have increased the cost very 
much. While the closeness of the print and the large format were 
unavoidable due to lack of funds, it is a great pity that this should 
have made it so difficult to read, particularly when misprints 
distort the meaning. But what surprises us is the difficulty you 
seem to have about dispatching the 300 copies we ordered other 
than by post. Your friends over there, Helmich and  Korff,  must 
be colossal asses indeed if they can't so much as tell you that the 
mail steamers also carry parcels and even heavy bales of 
merchandise, and that all details concerning freight, etc., etc. can 
be obtained at the steamship offices—not, of course, at the post 
office. The location of these steamship offices may be found in 
any newspaper announcement, beneath which there is always the 
name of a local business house. Moreover there are any number of 
forwarding agents concerned with handling such things, for 
example Edwards, Sandford & Co. of Liverpool and London, who 
also have an office in New York. You simply address the parcel as 
follows: 
(at the top) per ... Steamer 
care of Messrs Edwards, Sandford Sc Co., 
Liverpool 
(underneath) F. E. 
care of Messrs Ermen & Engels 
Manchester 
Printed books, not  bound. 
a containing K. Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte - b F. Freiligrath, 'An 
Joseph Weydemeyer', I and II. 

=====第151页=====
61. Engels to Weydemeyer. 11 June 1852 119 
That's all, and sent in this way it costs only a few shillings which 
Ermen & Engels can stand. But it's really too bad that people like 
Helmich and  Korff,  who have been in New York so long and who, 
moreover, also do a certain amount of business, should be 
ignorant of matters with which any child over here is familiar. 
The copies of the Turn-Zeitung have not yet arrived, either here 
or in London; you should make inquiries at your post office. 
The printing costs are colossal; for £5 per sheet—scarcely more 
than you have had to pay—we could get the thing similarly 
printed in London. Paper should, after all, be cheaper over there, 
since here it carries a duty of 1 '^d (3 cents) per lb. Perhaps you 
could inquire about the price from the local wholesale paper 
merchants and let us know what it is. 
Just send here anything destined for Europe. Marx has a 
German bookseller in London who is reliable and upon whom, 
moreover, he can keep an eye; this man will see to distribution 
both here, and in Germany, Switzerland, etc., etc., in return for a 
modest percentage. If, then, when you receive this letter you have 
not yet sent off the parcel with the 50 copies for London and 250 
for Cologne, take the opportunity of including in it as many as 
you think appropriate, or can spare, for the German bookseller to 
dispose of. But should it already have gone, send nothing more 
until we ask for it. We shall, of course, charge a higher price here, 
if only to defray our costs and the bookseller's commission. 15 
silver groschen is well within the means of the German philistine. 
Since the second issue is to be devoted exclusively to Freilig-
rath's poems, it is presumably already in print. These things, 
particularly the Kinkel poem, should not be held back a moment 
longer than is unavoidable. This should really have been published 
in one way or another ls after Kinkel's return to New York; but 
the longer it lingers, the more it loses in topicality and, even for 
things which are largely written with an eye to immortality, there 
is a certain period during which they are especially rewarding and 
at their most topical. But since I deliberately write, not with an eye 
to immortality, but rather for the immediate present, my article on 
the English bourgeoisie3 may well be somewhat long-drawn-out, 
especially since a work of this kind lends itself very well to 
piecemeal publication amongst other material in a newspaper or 
weekly; in a review, however, where because of its very length it 
takes up most of the space, it would not be topical or interesting 
enough for the American-German public. Besides, Mr Derby may

very well topple before August, and that's a ticklish sort of thing 
to prognosticate. 
While beholden to Korff for his goodwill, Dronke has no inten­
tion of going to America since he has just started a wholesale bus­
iness in cigar cases, etc., etc., as agent for a Parisian house. For that 
matter, neither Dronke nor any of the rest of us is on the same 
easy terms with Korff as during the first months of the N. Rh. Z.; 
we still remember all too clearly die circumstances of Korff s 
dismissal from the newspaper 151 and how subsequently, in New 
York, he published my Hungarian articles under his own name.152. 
He may be of some use to you in small ways, but you would be 
well advised not to trust him out of sight, and Marx is particularly 
anxious that Korff should not come butting in between himself 
and Dana, having, it seems, already caused some sort of ruction in 
this respect. In your letter you say that Marx will have been able 
to see for himself from Dana's letter how unresponsive the 
Tribune is to our cause; this passage we find totally incomprehen­
sible since Dana had written Marx a most cordial letter in which 
he requested, not only further instalments of the German article,3 
but other contributions as well. It would certainly not suit us if 
Korff were in any way to thrust himself forward as the 
representative or CHAMPION of either of us in personal matters. 
Since there is so much delay over the American exhibition,128 it 
would be better if vou were to take no further steps in respect of 
the leather businessb until you have again heard from us about it. 
Marx is up here just now and hence cannot for the time being 
speak to the Hungarian.0 For he and I are now engaged in a most 
interesting and amusing piece of workd which is to be published 
directly. As soon as we receive the first copies we shall send you 
one, then we shall also be able to discuss to what extent you can 
use the thing and, perhaps, make money out of it towards the 
production of new pamphlets, for this time it's going to be 
something that will indubitably sell. 
Eccarius has been written to about his final instalment6; he will 
have little to add, the workers—as was to be expected—having 
been beaten. 
Our dear, worthy Willich has suffered a grave misfortune. Once 
a week Baroness Brüningk used to invite the Prussian lieutenants 
in London and other such great men to her table, when it was her 
a Engels' series of articles, Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany. - b See this

custom to flirt with these gallant knights. This, it seems, caused 
the blood to rush violently to the head of our virtuous Willich, 
who,  finding himself one day tête-à-tête with the young lady, was 
suddenly overwhelmed by a fit of uncontrollable lust and, quite 
without warning, made a somewhat brutish attack upon her. But 
this had in no way been madame's intention, and she ordered our 
paragon of knightly virtue to be thrown out of the house sans 
façon? 
'Blessed is he that virtue loves, 
Woe to him that's lost it... 
A wretched stripling, here am I 
Chucked out into the street ' 
and the morally pure stoic, who as a rule felt a far greater 
sympathy for fair-haired young tailor's apprentices than for pretty 
young women, may thank his stars that he did not in the end find 
himself back 'in the guardroom at Kassel'c  as a result of this 
involuntary, instinctive outbreak of his physical ego so long kept 
enchained. The thing has been noted and circulated with great 
glee throughout London. There is, by the way, some prospect that 
you may have this gallant fellow in New York before too long. 
Over here the man 'who enjoyed the respect of all parties and 
even of his enemies', is daily losing more ground. He maintains 
relations with Kinkel and Schapper, his right and left hand props, 
only with reluctance (and in Kinkel's case on pecuniary grounds), 
for he hates them both and they him; he has several times 
received rough treatment at the hands of the inferior refugees, 
since when he has given them up. After this latest business he will 
never again be allowed into houses where there are young women, 
in addition to which he has now lost his aura of virtue. On the 
other hand he hears talk of how the men of Willich's Corps in 
New York stick together and he has the gallant Weitling 
there—hence, and more particularly when the flow of money 
from the loan fund 27 begins to dry up, he will probably make 
himself scarce. Indeed, he has already sent out an apostle in the 
shape of Heise from Kassel —this fellow forms part of his personal 
entourage. In addition he is now dispatching another harbinger, 
poor old Mirbach, who fell into his clutches through sheer, bitter 
necessity and, as a result of his total ignorance of the emigration's 
antecedents and his theoretical confusion, was naturally dazzled by 
a without further ado - b  Heine, 'Klagelied eines altdeutschen Jünglings'

such fine airs. He is au fond*  a very good fellow, a political 
nonentity, but otherwise honourable and, militarily speaking, I find 
him 10 times preferable to all the London great men. He used to 
call on Marx, but never unchaperoned by that lout Imandt and 
that philistine jackass Schily, so that it was never possible to talk to 
him frankly. 
In America our Willich would be in his element; the old crew in 
New York, which by now must have run completely wild and 
disintegrated into ROWDIES  AND  LOAFERS, would very soon grow sick of 
him and beat him black and blue—even over here his relationship 
with the swine finally degenerated into the low vulgarity of a mob 
of rogues bickering over plunder—while his friend, that experi­
enced trickster Weitling, would likewise ensure him a brilliant 
future. 
But I must close now. Marx sends his regards—many regards 
from us both to your wife.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 July 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
I am late, but I have come." How the delay came about, you will 
see from the tale recounted below: 
In London, the manuscript11 was copied out at once. By Monday 
noonc  it was all ready and complete. I dictated it by turns to my 
wife and Dronke. At midday on Wednesday I received the money. 
Bangya deducted the £7 about which you know. Add to that what 
was owed Dronke for his collaboration. This left an amount that 
did not even suffice for household needs. Strohn's CIRCUMSTANCES 
were such that he could not pay. And then came a run of 
exceptional ill-lück. 
Klose's wife, long ailing and wasting away in hospital, was 
discharged by the dirty dogs at the precise moment she was 
entering her final crisis, and died in his house three days ago. Not 
a centime available, funeral expenses, etc. Freiligrath could do 
nothing, having just bled all his acquaintances in order to help 
send Heilberg's wife and child back to Breslau, keep Heilberg 
himself alive and, finally, get him into hospital. Thus the thing 
devolved on me, and a vast amount of time and trouble it cost me 
before it was settled. Maintenant 0 all is peace and quiet again. 
The 'gang' are racking their brains over our pamphlet. Notably 
the Meyen-bug,e  who is in a cold sweat. He is 'quite unable to 
recall the least trespass against us'. Willich has had me sounded as 
to whether the Brüningk affair appears in it. The thought makes 
him exceedingly uneasy. 
'The true course' of this curious happening would now appear 
to be as follows: 
First, as you know, Willich denied it outright. His 2nd version 
ran: 'Mrs Brüningk has sought to corrupt him politically. Used Mr 
von Willich left and right, and other such means of corruption.' It 
a The German original is reminiscent of Schiller, Die Piccolomini, Act I, Scene 1.

was with 'moral intent', therefore, that he created a diversion in 
the region of her private parts. 
But now our partisan leader has put yet another construction on 
the case. 'The Brüningk woman (or so Imandt once told him) is a 
Russian spy. She tries to entrap young refugees. Old Willich stood 
in her way. Hence the anecdote intended to ruin him in the eyes 
of the émigrés. How political, deliberate and diabolical was this 
trumped-up "anecdote", emerges from the very fact of its having 
been Mrs Briiningk's own husband who circulated the rumour of 
the outrage for the sole purpose of discrediting Willich.' 
But that is not all. The chivalrous Schimmelpfennig maintains 
that Willich invented the spy story to conceal the insubordination 
of his 'cazzo'. a As things now stand, the issue remains undecided 
between these two worthies, and Willich, taking refuge in one lie 
after another, is well and truly compromising  himself. 
The cuckold Brüningk reminds me of a nice joke I found a few 
days ago in one of Machiavelli's commedia: 
Nicia (cuckold): Chi e San eu cu? 
Ligurio: E il più honorato santo che sia in Francia.^ 
Willich and Kinkel mightily worried about how best to effect a 
revolution on £1,200. Schurz, Schimmelpfennig, Strodtmann, etc., 
are drawing further and further away from Kinkel. 
Not even 100 horsepower could drag Willich away from the 
coffre-fort.c 
Kinkel, knowing that Imandt and I see each other, calls on 
Imandt a week ago and says, 'What a pity it was my Economy had 
not yet come out, so that one might at last have a positive basis to 
go on.' Imandt questions him about Freiligrath's poem.' 1 'Never 
read such things,' retorts Godofredus. 
The most ludicrous thing about it is that, having existed for 
years solely by abusing us the curs now declare it beneath 'our 
dignity' and 'station' to write such t-t-tittle-tattle. Les drôles!''

You will have read about the new arrests in Paris.155  The boobies 
(this time the Ruge clique) naturally had to come up with yet 
another pseudo-conspiracy. Their correspondent in Paris, as I was 
informed some considerable time ago, is one Engländer, a 
notorious police spy (in Paris) who, of course, immediately passes 
all their letters to the service. Not content with that, the French 
police have sent Simon Deutsch over here to pump Tausenau. 
Louis Napoleon must have a conspiracy, cost what it may. 
But he has got one on his hands about which as yet he seems to 
know nothing. That of the Orleans family, whose agent Mr 
Bangya (with the assent of the Hungarian 'radicals') has now 
become. The plan: Bonaparte is to be caught out one evening 
with his drab, to whom he goes slinking behind the Englishwo­
man's back. A senior police officer has been suborned. Two 
generals are said to have been won over. Nemours himself was in 
Paris a fortnight ago. Large sums paid out for the distribution of 
anti-Louis Napoleon pamphlets. 
What do you think of it? If one of the Orleans were again to 
visit Paris and we happened to know when, should we, d'une 
manière ou d'une autre, h denounce the 'vrai prince' to the 'faux 
prince'"? Let me have your views on the matter.

I am just tackling Mr Görgey. At that time, drawing on Austrian 
bulletins, we of the N. Rh. Z. made splendidly accurate guesses as 
to the course of the Hungarian war, and prognostications, if 
cautious, proved brilliantly correct. 3 Görgey's book b is truly 
wretched, nothing could be more pettily invidious, infamously 
mesquin c and mediocre. The military part is good, Görgey to the 
life,—  sudden transformation of talented ex-lieutenant into gener­
al, still bearing unmistakable traces of the company officer and 
tactical tyro. Hungarians who maintain that Görgey is incapable of 
having written this are jackasses. The genuine Görgeyesque and 
Austrian elements are as easily distinguishable here as are the two 
heterogeneous elements in Chenu. Dfi But otherwise the book 
may—with some caution—very well be used as a source. The 
fellow's malicious mediocrity is such that he cannot help making a 
fool of  himself,  witness the affair of the proclamation of 
Waitzen u7 in which he reproaches Kossuth for having been 
shrewder in practice than in his bombastic speeches, or again, the 
very inept descriptions which lead the author, always involuntarily, 
into compromising  himself.  This mediocrity never permits Görgey 
to draw a true portrait of any one chap, but the thing has some 
pleasant traits and individual comments on Kossuth and most of 
the others. Despite the mediocrity of his malice, Görgey —as is 
everywhere apparent—was after all superior to any of the 
others—so what must the others be like! 
At all events, I shall write about the Hungarian war.1S6 
Judging by the facts, the Paris plot1M  would seem more likely to 
have emanated from our carrément and crânement 6 sinister 
Barthélémy, etc.— the daring artillery preparation is something 
qui sent son Willich de vingt lieues. e It is more than likely that Ruge, 
etc., also had a finger in the pie, but those cannons fashioned out 
of gas pipes and draped with tarpaulins are of Hohenzollern 
origin.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 13 July 1852 
Dear Engels, 
There being no letter from you, I conclude that the worthy 
Weydemeyer must, for all that/ be still persevering with his 
'system'. The thing's becoming really incomprehensible and, quite 
aside from the pecuniary loss, which is just now very perceptible, 
is turning me for good measure into the laughing stock of the 
émigré vermin and of the booksellers whom I had approached 
about this unfortunate affair. 
I have not written an article on the elections because I feel it 
would be better to await the full results.159  From what I have seen 
so far, it seems to me that, apart from 5-6 more votes for the 
Whigs, the old Parliament will rise again unchanged. The fellows 
are in a cercle  vicieux d from which they cannot break out. The only 
ones to have suffered any significant losses so far are the 
Peelites. 73 Meanwhile, in an apologia for Graham, The Morning 
Chronicle declares that only one alternative remains, that Whigs 
are as incompetent as Tories, and that the only capable people, 
apart from Graham and his supporters, are Cobden, Bright and 
Co. And these should govern together. Curiously enough, the 
following day—as you may perhaps have seen,— The Times 
carried an article which likewise contained an apologia for 
Graham.''

The great Techow is emigrating to Australia next week, 
together with Madame Schmidt-Stirner. But—and this will wound 
you more deeply—even Damm is no less eager to turn his hand to 
AUSTRALIAN GOLD-DIGGING. Another few months of peace, and all our 
'world underminers' a will be busily mining for dirt in the dirt of 
Australia. Only Willich, firmly chained to the coffre-fort, h remains 
faithful to his motto: to live but BY NO MEANS work. 
Bangya is now on very close terms with the Orleanist intriguer, 
'de Rémusat'. Some Hungarian quelconque' warned him against the 
man who is said to have 'betrayed' the Germans during the complot 
allemand-français. 143 Rémusat has agents right in the Paris Prefec­
ture.  So, sans mot dire à M. Bangya'' he writes asking for a report 
on this gentleman. The reply, which was communicated to me, 
stated that Bangya was in no way suspect, that he had got out in 
time,  otherwise he too would have been arrested. The traitor was 
'un certain Cherval, nommé Frank, mais dont le véritable nom est 
Cramer.'" 
From the outset this Cherval is said to have been hand in glove 
with the police. What is more, Rémusat is receiving original letters 
written by Cherval to the Prussian Embassy, stating that, in 
accordance with promises made to him in the Mazas, 16 and now 
that he had professed the 'principe' of ordre, it was 'leur devoir' 1 to 
provide him with the necessary 'moyens'.* The Prussian Embassy, 
however, declared that since he was being paid as a spy by the 
French, and double emploi h was out of the question, he could have 
no claims on the Prussians. He was therefore sent to London to 
observe the German refugees and, in addition, to 'keep an eye on 
Claremont'.161  In the latter capacity he called on Rémusat and 
offered him his services as an agent. Rémusat, on instructions 
from Paris, pretended to agree and assigned to him a go-between 
in the person of a valet at Claremont; this man was now entrusted 
with the task of misinforming the Paris police through Cherval. 
So well organised is the Orleanist agitation that the fellows 
possess what amounts to a regular clandestine postal service by 
which one can send letters, parcels, and pamphlets to France as 
safely as innocuous matter by ordinary mail. 
My main concern in all this was to procure an original letter of 
Cherval's relating to his connections with the Prussian Embassy. 
a The original has Weltumwiihler by analogy with Wühler (agitators), the name the 
bourgeois constitutionalists in Germany in 1848-49 applied to republican demo­
crats.  - h safe - r or other -  <* without a word to Mr Bangya - e  a certain Cherval,

Such a pièce could topple the whole fabric of the bill of 
indictment. 16 
I have arranged with Bangya that, as soon as another copy has 
been made, you will receive Szemere's pamphlet in manuscript.3 It 
is a document that is indispensable to your workb  since it contains 
letters from Görgey, Kossuth, etc., which have not been published 
anywhere. 
My wife is very poorly, she has a cough and is losing weight.

try to discount with Johnson the £5 that will then become due 
from Dana. 
Apropos. The Domenichi 'Orlando Innamorato' riformato is an 
adaptation. The original is very rare and only to be had in large

withhold any further news from us. By the way, things cannot be 
going very well for him and, when all's said and done, he's got to 
earn his daily bread. 
Did you read the article 2-3 days ago in The Morning Herald on 
the various leading men in the Opposition? It could only have 
been written by Disraeli  himself.  The 'AND  NOW  STAND  FORTH,  THOU  MAN 
OF "UNADORNED ELOQUENCE", RICHARD COBDEN' is splendid. In it Master 
John Bright was rightly recognised as the only dangerous fellow, 
although the gentlemen are not free from illusions in regard to 
Graham. Precisely now this unscrupulous old ambitieux" constitutes 
a very real danger to the Tories. 
Bon voyage to the patriotic gold diggers! Thus the term 
'underminer' at last acquires a true meaning and content.1' 
The new connection with Mr Rémusat is excellent. A letter from 
Cherval to the Prussian Embassy would be a capital document in 
this trial. Don't fail to get hold of one. What a long face our old 
friend, le jeune," the self-important Saedt will pull, 69 if we thus 
reduce to chaff the fifty sheets of his bill of indictment which he 
has already announced to the world through the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung\ A Has Rémusat already got these letters? By the 
way, it would appear from the news in the papers, not only that 
Mr Manteuffel proposes to turn the Cologne trial into a 
magnificent political drama—with, of course, some sort of coup in 
the wings—but also, on the other hand, that there is absolutely no 
evidence, and that the weakness of the indictment has to be veiled 
in a cloud of rumour on the part of the police and lies on the part 
of their spies. Have you heard nothing more from Bangya? I 
return herewith the gallant fellow's letter, hitherto forgotten. 
But if you get hold of Cherval's letter, is there any way of 
attesting it, so that its authenticity is established? Otherwise a 
presiding judge of this ilk would be capable of prohibiting so 
much as a reading of the document. 
Since, as I hear, the trial is to take place on the 28th, it is 
important for us just now to have several reliable links with 
Cologne. If only we knew to what extent one can count on 
Bermbach's doing anything! Letters could be safely sent to him 
via Bradford. If we knew that Weerth was in Hamburg, the thing 
would be in order. I shall write to Strohn about it this very day. At 
the same time we might even make use of Naut, if needs be. For, 
contrary to all my expectations, the latter—who has left Em-

Bradford—obtained some military stuff for me from a second­
hand bookseller in Cologne with the utmost promptitude; the 
mystery will be cleared up when I tell you that he wants to become 
an agent for Ermen & Engels and has further asked me to secure 
him the agency for a local twist house. I have promised him all 
this and shall recommend him to my old man. We can, therefore, 
rely on his being punctilious for as long as these negotiations last. 
The military material obtained for me by Naut—clearly the 
library of a retired artillery officer—is coming in very handy, the 
more so since it is mainly concerned with the more elementary 
aspects of military science, the actual day-to-day routine, etc. That 
was just what was wanting. In addition, some splendid stuff on 
fortifications, etc., etc. I shall soon have got to the stage when I 
can venture to advance, even in public, an INDEPENDENT military 
opinion. 
The Szemere piece3 will be extremely  welcome;  but I cannot think 
of working it up as yet. 
Herewith the article for Dana.1' I shall now make haste to 
conclude the series; but you do something on England as well. If 
we can extract £3 a week out of the fellow, I'll be damned if we 
can't manage to send your wife into the country for a spell before 
the summer's over—that would do her more good than any 
amount of porter. At all events, I'm glad to hear that her 
indisposition is not serious. 
Just give me another year's military study, and the democratic 
lieutenants will get the surprise of their lives.

IN MANCHESTER 
London, 20 July 2 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
Dronke will be bringing you the manuscript on Görgey, b 
admittedly a wretched, muddled affair; likewise the Neveu de 
Rameau and Jacques le fataliste c in the original. 
Yesterday received a letter from Bermbach in Cologne, the gist 
of which is as follows: 
'Latterly they have been visiting all sorts of people in various places in an 
attempt to find correspondence from you which, they are convinced, was to be 
conveyed through the agency of these persons to democrats in the Rhineland. Your 
friends in Cologne are at last to be brought before the Court of Assizes. The bill of 
indictment, a most compendious work, has been drawn up, the date for the public 
hearing has been fixed for the 28th of this month, and the usual preliminaries are 
under way. They will be tried according to the Code pénal, since their offence 
antedates the new Prussian Statute Book. 164 As I understand the case they are, 
legally speaking, in an exceptionally good position but, as you will know, before a 
jury the moral standpoint is all important, and in this respect there can be no 
denying the danger for some of the accused. For the principal defendants, Röser, 
Bürgers, Nothjung and Reiff,  have given away far too much: they have admitted a 
connection with specific tendencies over a definite period; have talked of the 
enrolment of new members attended by certain formalities and pledges, and other 
such things, which in themselves do not constitute a crime, but may, depending on 
circumstances, have an adverse effect on the jurymen, most of whom have been 
chosen from the peasantry—particularly when there is such evident lack of respect 
for God and landed property. Grave difficulties will also arise in connection with 
the defence; the advocates know nothing about such matters, most are hostile on 
principle and dread the thought of the ten-day sitting fixed for the case. Freiligrath 
will be beheaded in contumaciam. 
'I have just read the bill of indictment which contains no less than 65-70 pages. 
If they're convicted, these people have only their own statements to blame. I doubt 
[there] can be any more consummate jackasses than these German working men: 
Reiff made some statements that were regular denunciations, and various others 
behaved no less ineptly. One sees what a dangerous business it is to establish 
connections with working men, when those connections are supposed to be kept 
secret. Small wonder that the fellows were so much harassed; the longer they were 
held in solitary confinement, the more satisfactory statements they made. That 
aside, facts don't come into it and, if the accused had not for the most part 
themselves talked so readily, there would be nothing whatever to go on. The bill of

the help of spies and intercepted letters, a fairly accurate knowledge has been

So much for Bermbach. 
Vis-à-vis Schimmelpfennig, Willich has retracted his statement 
about the B[rüningk] woman. Schimmelpfennig has now put it

A certain Cœurderoy (d'ailleurs très bon républicain). h who has 
already published a little pamphlet against Mazzini, Ledru,

Proudhon is publishing a new work.6 Religion, the State, etc., 
having become impossible, only 'individuals' remain, a discovery 
he has lifted from Stirner.f 
That jackass W[eydemeyer]'s impardonable procrastination has 
put me in such straits that today I can't even afford a  STAMP  for this 
letter.

constituents produce the same old Parliament. In that Parliament 
what have hitherto been the ruling parties are rotting from within, 
mutually offsetting and paralysing each other, so that they are 
compelled to appeal yet again to their constituents and so on, ad 
infinitum, until the circle is broken from without by the pressure 
of the masses, and that may soon be the case. At no previous 
election has the conflict between the real majority and the official 
majority of voters created by the electoral privileges been so 
glaringly in evidence. You should know that at every English 
election voting is done 1. by a SHOW OF HANDS when the whole 
population votes, and 2. by a POLL, the decisive one, in which only 
the enfranchised vote. Those NOMINATED by the  SHOW  OF HANDS  do not 
include a single Member of Parliament, while those returned by 
the POLL (i.e. really ELECTED), do not include anyone nominated by 
the SHOW OF HANDS. Take Halifax, for example, where Wood, the 
Whig Minister (Finance) was opposing E. Jones. At the SHOW OF 
HANDS,  Wood was hissed. Jones received 14,000 votes and was 
carried in triumph through the town. At the POLL, Wood was 
elected while Jones received only 36 votes. 
There is little new to report about émigré affairs. But for a few 
louts,  Willich stands more and more isolated, no one believing in 
his probity any longer. As I have told you, Reichenbach, though 
he resigned from the committee long ago, refuses to hand out a 
penny from the loan until a definitive committee has been formed. 
In his eyes, Willich and Kinkel are as unacceptable as the handful 
of blackguards who elected them. Reichenbach est un honnête 
bourgeois, qui prend sa responsabilité au sérieux? 
The French emigration has split into 3 camps: 1. Revolution 
(Ledru). 2. Delegation (the more progressive). 3. 1,500 opponents 
of both, the plebs or, as the aristocrats used to call them, the 
'populeart. A certain Cceurderoy {d'ailleurs très bon républicain)^ has 
published a pamphlet against Mazzini-Ledru and Cabet-Blanc and 
is shortly to bring out something else. You will receive both when 
they appear.

'P.S. I have just read the bill of indictment which contains no less than 65-70 
pages.  If they're convicted, these people have only their own statements to blame. I 
doubt there can be any more consummate jackasses than these working men: Reiff 
made statements that were almost regular denunciations, and various others 
behaved no less ineptly. Small wonder that the fellows were so much harassed; the 
longer they have been held in solitary confinement, the more satisfactory 
statements they made. That aside, facts don't come into it.'

have to be made with people such as these...

be able to avenge himself with impunity. 163 
Could you perhaps get hold of Cceurderoy's things for me? I.e. 
if they're worth the trouble, and contain anything more than mere 
rhetoric. 
Our Worcell, as I learn from Smitt,b really was a count and a 
protagonist of the Volhynian insurrection; he distinguished 
himself by being cut off and leading a kind of robber band in the 
woods for some 3-4 weeks, until taken off to Poland by Rozzycki; 
our Sznayde commanded some cavalry—from what I know so 
far—without distinction. A work by Mieroslawski on the Polish 
campaign, which came out in Berlin in 1847,c is very highly 
spoken of by Smitt.d This Mieroslawski is certainly the most 
eminent among Poles and is likely to make a name for  himself. 
Mind you don't forget the English article!e 
I am expecting Drunkel' this evening, together with a bag of

in the original. N'est-ce pas h very cunning? I am to have recourse 
to an English court on account of insults offered at Cincinnati. 
And how coolly everything is rejected that might smack of a duel 
and the like. 
Since I could only assume that the worthy Gottfried Kinkel, who 
drops the Johann when in public, would refuse to accept further 
letters bearing a Soho postmark, I hit upon the following ruse. I 
asked Ernest Jones to write the address and Lupus to post the 
letter itself in Windsor, where he had business. Inside the 
envelope, Gottfried found a second little billet-doux, its margin 
adorned with a posy of forget-me-nots and roses printed in colour 
and with the following content:

'with a letter, likewise before me, written at some time by Dr

This last was self-complacently pocketed by Mr 'Johann etc.' and 
is now circulating among the ranks of the emigres. But the cream 
of the jest will only become plain to Kinkel later on, with the 
appearance of the first instalment of The Great Men of the Exile. 
Namely, that, shortly before this fearsome attack on Gottfried, I 
diverted myself by doing him direct and personal injury, while at 
the same time justifying myself in the eyes of the émigré louts. To 
that end I needed something 'in black and white' from Johann etc. 
Now for greater matters.— Mazzini, no less, has for the past few 
days been dashing round like mad in an attempt to bring about an 
agreement between all those who officially make up the bourgeois 
emigration here. Also betook himself to Johann etc. And with the 
following result: Mazzini, Kossuth, Ledru-Rollin and Kinkel 
constitute Europe's Executive. Each member of this authority has 
the right to co-opt 2 subjects of his nationality. However, the 
decision as to these co-options rests with the majority among the 
four originals, i.e. Mazzini. Accordingly, co-opted among the 
Germans are A. Ruge and A. Goegg. Who among the other 
nationalities, I don't yet know. Kinkel, for his part, is said to have 
laid down 2 conditions: 1. a demand of 20,000 dollars for his loan. 
This I hold to be a fabrication. 2. The continued and independent 
existence of the Kinkel-Willich, etc. finance committee. This is no 
more than formal deference to Willich, for in fact it has already 
been decided to transfer the entire loan fund to A. Goegg. Finally, 
Kinkel & Co. will most humbly recognise the Revolutionary 
League in America. m This is the latest turn of events. How far 
they have progressed towards concluding this important treaty or 
whether they are still lingering over the preliminaries I do not 
know. In any case the thing must be noised abroad in America, with 
particular emphasis on the following. At the last guarantors' 
meeting in London, in May 1852, when the Kinkel-Willich 
committee was definitively elected, Kinkel most solemnly declared 
on his word of honour that if A. Ruge were elected to the 
committee, he himself would walk out, for he would never serve 
on the same committee as a man who had publicly described him 
as an agent of the Prince of Prussia. 3 
Secondly: What will Weitling & Co. say, if the dollars raised in 
America by Kinkel are expended by the Finance Minister, 
A. Goegg? For this is what is intended, in order to subsidise 
'K. Heinzen's' Janus and to put into circulation the immortal 
articles of Ruge, Heinzen, etc.

As for Mazzini, this wily enthusiast is steadily descending to the 
level of an Italian 'Gustav Struve' or some such. For the past 4 
years he has been shouting 'Action, action'. Now it so happens that 
the Austrian police in Italy are running in 600 Mazzinists whose 
correspondence is conducted on pocket handkerchiefs in invisible 
ink. But these people have no wish to be detained and their family 
connections are extensive. So Mr Mazzini has received from Italy a 
letter announcing their intention to take 'action' in real earnest 
and hit out. All at once, and  post  festum, a 'sober reason' stirs in the 
bosom of the bombastic man of action, and he adjures them for 
God's sake to lie low, since on their own they can do nothing, the 
country is swarming with foreign soldiers, and similar loci 
communesb  none of which are either more or less true now than 
they were in 1849. Action, action! Italia farà da sè!c 
A few days ago Lupus met an Italian member of Mazzini's 
committee and taxed him with most of these absurdities. What of 
it? retorts the Roman, more than 600 people are killed in a battle. 
However, since the Italians fear that in this way they will  BY AND  BY 
be caught, shot or locked up, and since this or that victim of his 
exhortations is sending relatives to London, our man of action is 
afraid that some misunderstanding may lead to his being stabbed 
by a deluded and frenzied fellow-countryman; so every night he 
changes his lodgings on the pretext of having to hide from the 
Austrians. Yet it is not Austrians but 'deluded' Italians from whom 
he abjectly slinks into hiding. Surely this antipope deserves the 
gallows? To harass, tease, wear down a nation in this way! The 
inevitable result, particularly in the case of a people like the 
Italians, is a state of appalling, passive dejection, of complete and 
utter collapse. 
Our people were to have appeared before the JURY in Cologne 
yesterday, but suddenly came the announcement of a further 
adjournment because one of the witnesses for the prosecution, 
Schulz, a police official in Berlin, had fallen ill. So if Mr Schulz 
were to die, the defendants might well remain under preliminary 
investigation until doomsday. In the meantime Becker is going 
blind and Daniels is getting consumption.  C'est  par trop infâme. d In 
all this, the bourgeois press is playing a most abominable role. 
I saw the notice of adjournment in the Kölnische Zeitung' A few 
days earlier I had received the following report from Cologne/ 
a after the event - b commonplaces - ' Italy will manage on her own! - d It's too 
iniquitous. - e  [Report from Cologne* of 26 July,] Kölnische Zeitung, No. 183, 27 
July 1852. - f Below is a passage from Bermbach's letter to Marx of mid-July 
1852. 

=====第175页=====
72. Marx to Cluss. 30 July 1852 143 
'When Becker was arrested the following letters from you were seized; those of 
8.2.51,  21.2.51 and  9.4.51.  From the latter the ensuing passages have been picked 
out by the prosecution as exceptionally incriminating: "Herewith the jolly scribble 
from the School of Kinkel. 15 shillings have accumulated here f.t.l. a 10 shillings are 
still outstanding, having been promised but not yet collected. I shall proceed in the 
manner you indicate. So debit me with £1. For owing to the reduced circumstances 
of the member who should pay it, five shillings cannot be collected." The 
prosecution makes out that the letters f.t.l. stand for "For the League", while 
Becker claims that they are an abbreviation indicating an arrangement made 
between him and yourself concerning the acquisition of cheaper literature for you 
in London. That passage constitutes one of the chief items in the indictment, since 
there is otherwise hardly any evidence, unless fabricated, against B. Again, the 
indictment, starting in the year 1831, traces the rise of the Communist League 
from an association of Germans in Paris which underwent various modifications 
under the names "League of Germans",174 "League of the Just",175 but continued 
uninterruptedly right up to the present society now appearing in the dock. This 
information apparently derives from data provided by the Hanoverian govern­
ment. The prosecution attaches no importance whatever to the split in London in 
1850 l5; in their opinion this was simply a personal squabble, the whole lot of them 
were, after all, pursuing the same criminal aims and shared the same views and 
would, moreover, act in concert at the hour of decision. Thus, besides the two 
addresses previously published in the press, a 3rd has been incorporated in the 
indictment; this address is said to be dated June or July 1850 17f> and to have been 
intercepted in Leipzig. 
'The only statements of any note are those of the witnesses Haupt, who gave a 
fairly detailed and comprehensive story, and Hentze, an ex-lieutenant, who to some 
extent attacked Becker. On Saturday Erhardt, a cashier with Stein, the banker, was 
arrested on the same charge. He is said to be slightly compromised by reason of 
the recommendation he gave to Nothjung and of a few letters discovered on the 
latter which seemed to indicate some understanding between the two... By the way, 
so nicely have the jurymen been selected that, if you consider the odds, the State 
could not be better placed.' 
The most important news politically is the treaty concluded 
between Prussia, Austria and Russia during the Czar'sb visit to 
Vienna.177 It was first announced in The Morning Chronicle the day 
before yesterday. Yesterday there was a reprint of it in The Times,c 
so you will be able to read it for  yourself.  Here the election results 
are such that the Tories, who will drop the Corn Law question, 
possess a large counter-revolutionary majority on all other issues 
and this Cabinet will, I believe, give way before nothing short of a 
more or less revolutionary manifestation. The bourgeois now 
realise what a blunder they made in failing to draw the political 
conclusions from their anti-Corn Law victory in 1846. Ils y 
penseront. d My list of printing errors for the Brumaire will soon

Dear Engels, 
Don't forget to let me have the rest of the thing6 by Tuesday. The 
section on the Tories is too short by  itself.  This time there is a 
twofold reason why the portions sent to Dana should not be too 
niggardly. 1. In Cincinnati that blackguard Heinzen is siding with

the Whigs against the Democrats, because he rightly believes this 
ELECTIONEERING TIME is the best moment at which to sell  himself. 
Greeley reported in the Tribune the speech Heinzen made there, 
and went on to praise the man." So storm clouds are threatening 
me from that quarter. 2. Having for weeks, and particularly for 
the past fortnight, been forced to spend 6 hours a day chasing 
after 6d for grub, on top of which I am again being pestered by 
my LANDLADY, I had no other alternative but to write to Johnson 
yesterday inquiring whether he would discount a bill on the 
Tribune for me. Should the man agree to do what I ask, which is 
still in dubio, b I shall have to inform Dana, and if we send him 
short articles, he will think he is being fleeced and will cast me out 
of the temple, since he now has such a plentiful SUPPLY from 
Heinzen, Ruge and B. Bauer. What is even more unfortunate, I 
see from today's Times that the Daily Tribune is protectionist^ So 
it's all VERY OMINOUS. We must send the fellow something as quickly 
as possible before he countermands. I can't yet send off my dispatchd 
since I have a frightful headache—not, however, from the effects 
Of PALE ALE. 
It's regrettable that Dronke will not be here on Saturday.6  Goegg 
has called a general meeting of refugees for that day and the little 
man's presence would have been very desirable. For Pieper isn't 
the right person. At all events, Dronke must see to it that he is 
here when the rabble arrives from Berlin, for I cannot cope with 
these blackguards all by  myself. 
I have all manner of stuff from Cluss, too, to send you, which

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] Friday, 6 August 1852 
Dear Marx, 
You will have got back the first half of the article" in English 
and German yesterday afternoon. The secondb you shall have on 
Tuesday morning. As for being thrown out of the Tribune, you 
need have no worries/ We are too firmly ensconced there. 
Furthermore, to the Yankees, this European politicising is mere 
dilettantism in which he who writes best and with the greatest 
esprit comes out on top. Heinzen can do us no harm; if he's 
bought by the Whigs, it means that he will obey them, not that he 
will give the orders. Ruge, Bauer, etc., etc., in addition to 
ourselves ensure that the Tribune has an 'all-round' character. As 
for protectionism, it does no harm. American Whigs are all 
industrial protectionists, but this by no means implies that they 
belong to the landed aristocracy, Derby variety. Nor are they- so 
stupid not to know just as well as does List that FREE TRADE suits 
English industry better than anything else. By the way, I could at a 
pinch insert a word here and there to that effect with the 
FREETRADERS, which you could cross out if not to your liking. But 
there's really no need for it. 
I thought you had long since settled the discounting affair with 
Johnson and very much hope something will come of it. As for 
me, I get deeper in the mire financially every day. While I much 
enjoy having Papa Dronke here, it is impossible to work of an 
evening, and so a fair amount of money is being frittered away; 
on top of that there are current DISBURSEMENTS besides £20 owing to 
the business, which make things very tight. Dronke intends to 
return next week (at the beginning), after which I shall do a spell 
of hard work, having sufficient material here, and then, by the 
end of September, I shall again have some money at my 
disposal—a few pounds in Septemberd for sure. Most unfortu­
nately, in an evil hour Mr Pindar also asked me for a loan. He is 
still keeping afloat on three lessons a week and seems to have

Moreover, towards the end of June I was unable, owing to all 
sorts of circumstances, to charge up to my old man a number of 
extras which have now been placed to my account. Meanwhile, we 
are busy with the balance sheet; actually it is no concern of mine, 
but it will at least give me some indication of how far I can go. If 
it turns out well—which I shall know in some 4-6 weeks' time, I 
might be able to chance something, in which case you will at once 
receive some money. Only this month, because of the £20 or £25 
I owe the business, I am absolutely stuck. 
I don't know how I can arrange to do an article on GERMANY for 
Dana behind Dronke's back—he knows nothing about the 
matter.181  At the office I have my hands completely full until 7 
o'clock in the evening, so I can't do it there. Cependant je verrai! 3

are no revolutionaries, they're a couple of blackguards who have 
been thrown out of public houses by the workers in London'.183 
Knowing my Gottfried, I began by sending him the following note 
in which I pretended to be not quite sure of the facts, thereby 
giving him fresh occasion for ambiguities: 
'5 Sutton Street, Soho, Office of The People's Paper, 
'22 July 1852 
'To Dr Johann Gottfried Kinkel 
'You are alleged, or so I am informed, to have ventured the 
following statement before Anneke or other Germans at Cincin­

Kinkel sent the following note by return: 
'To Dr Karl Marx 
Since the article about me was published under your auspices during my 
imprisonment, I have wanted to have nothing more to do with you. If you believe 
that you can, through the testimony of Anneke or other honourable men, rather

with a written statement, now before me, by your guarantor Huzel 
whom you cravenly required at Cincinnati to give his word of 
honour to keep silent about your mendacious gossip there, a 
promise which, however, was given only conditionally by Huzel; 
'with a letter, likewise before me, written some time earlier by Dr 
Gottfried Kinkel in his own hand to his ex-guarantor Cluss, in which

the same Kinkel boasts of his intention to enter into political 
relations with me: 
'your letter—and this is precisely why 'it was provoked — 
provides a new and striking proof that the said Kinkel is a cleric 
whose baseness is only equalled by his cowardice. 
Dr Karl Marx' 
This last was swallowed in silence by Mr Johann etc. who, since 
then, has carefully avoided letting us hear anything more from 
him. 
Kossuth's secret circular, which Cluss speaks of in his last letter, 
you will find in English in tomorrow's issue of Jones' PAPER.184 
Hence I am not enclosing it. 
The meeting of Kinkel's guarantors took place on Tuesday 
3 August. The chief item was the following: Reichenbach is 
guarding the exchequer like a Cerberus. The £200 so far spent by 
Kinkel and Willich was received from Gerstenberg, etc., against 
the revolutionary deposits. Statutorily, they may dispose of these 
only after at least 3 people have been nominated by the 
guarantors. And Reichenbach insists on observance of this 
formality. To remedy the inconvenience, Kinkel and Willich had 
decided to have Techow as the third nominee. True, Techow is 
sailing for Australia in 3 weeks' time. But, under the statutes of 
the loan, once the committee had its full complement of 3 
members, it could on its own authority propose two more. Hence, 
the sole purpose of Techow's nomination was 1. to make 
Reichenbach hand over the exchequer, 2. to enable them later on 
to bring in 2 men of straw in Techow's place. However, the 
meeting immediately decided against Techow on the grounds that 
he was only being used as a cover and was leaving for Australia. 
Kinkel and Willich were told that their conduct of affairs was 
unsatisfactory, that they inspired no confidence and that they must 
submit a detailed account concerning the expenditure of the £200 
before it could be ratified. This last and other decisions are to be 
SETTLED today, Friday the 6th, at a further guarantors' meeting. 
At the sitting on the 3rd, Reichenbach proposed that the £1,000 
be deposited in the Bank of England and left untouched until the 
outbreak of the revolution. Löwe (in alliance with Ruge) proposed 
that the money be handed over to the Revolutionary League in 
America. 173 
And although Kinkel himself stated, in the enclosed note to 
Huzel, that Ruge falsely suspected him of being an agent of Ü\e

Prince of Prussia,185  and although he, upon the strength of that, 
pledged his word at the guarantors' meeting last May that he would 
never sit on the same committee as Ruge, our Gottfried now 
declares himself ready, for the sake of the cause, to act in concert 
with Goegg, Ruge, etc. and to administer the money in concert 
with them, in order to get a hand in the administration at all. 
Willich, however, now convinced that the £1,000 will not, like the 
200 already spent, produce any further windfalls for him is said to 
have decided to emigrate to America, whither he has already been 
preceded by the trusty Gebert and Dietz. 
Last week Papa Goegg again convened his Agitation Club.26  An 
exact count revealed that it consisted of exactly 8 people, the place 
of Sigel and Fickler, who had disappeared, being taken by the 
newly-joined Oswald and Dralle. In addition it was found that, 
though Goegg had in the meantime acquired great fame as 
Kossuth's servant and has rendered 'sterling service' as an agitator 
for the Revolutionary League, he had otherwise not brought back 
even enough cash to cover the debts 'incurred to defray travelling 
expenses'. In these doubtful circumstances the agitators a felt 
compelled to attempt an alliance with Kinkel, in order that they 
might with decorum get at the £1,000. Kinkel likewise sees therein 
the last chance of avoiding an irreversible divorce from the 
£1,000. With the secret purpose of furthering this design, Goegg 
has convened a general meeting of refugees for tomorrow, the 7th, 
at Schärttner's. Ostensibly to report on his grands œuvres!' In fact, 
to be swept by general acclaim into an alliance with Kinkel and the 
£1,000. This may now not be accomplished. 
But a third complication arises now, whose immediate effect is 
to debar both sides, Kinkel and Goegg, from the 'exchequer'. To 
be precise, on the one  hand,  our Eduard Meyen is agitating for the money 
to be used to launch a big  LONDON  WEEKLY  PAPER.  And, on the other, the 
'critical' Edgar Bauer, who had barely heard of the predicament in 
which the £1,000 found  itself,  before he too crept forth and, 
taking up position behind Schily, Imandt, Schimmelpfennig, etc., 
also solicited a newspaper for  himself.  Imandt, etc., see this 
as the only means of rescuing the money from Kinkel and 
Goegg. Edgar Bauer adopts towards these people the appearance 
of a 'harmless humorist'. 
I shall obtain an exact account of today's sitting since Imandt is 
now an L.M.C To revert to the one of the 3rd, I would mention 
the following: After questions of high policy had been dealt with, 
a members of the Agitation Club - b great works - c Communist League member

the chivalrous Schimmelpfennig arose; certain persons had, he 
said, put it about that the Brüningk woman was a spy and he now 
declared them to be vile calumniators. Kinkel denied that he for 
his part had ever made any such assertion. (He had in fact made it 
to the whoreson Kamm of Bonn when the latter passed this way.) 
Willich, on whom all eyes were turned, sat tight and said nothing. 
Techow declared that it was even more vile when such suspicions 
were bandied about by persons who, for a whole year, had 
enjoyed the Brüningk woman's hospitality. It was their duty rather 
to refute such a talk whenever they got wind of it. 
All eyes were turned on Willich. Willich did not stir, but 
throughout the whole of this sitting, which saw the fading of so 
many 'golden' dreams, is said to have been the very personification 
of 'unhappy consciousness'. 
Well, enough of that crap for today/ 
I have just received the enclosed letter from Freiligrath, from 
which it appears that cur Johnson remains adamant.3 Hence I am 
utterly at a loss what to do and my position is becoming 
abominable. 
So honest Goegg has sent Freiligrath an invitation! He's one 
they can still never do without, but in the end they will have to.

[Manchester,] Monday evening [9 August 1852] 
Dear Marx, 
I've done a stupid thing. In its MAIL TABLE the Daily News does 
not mention any American STEAMER for Wednesday — so I suc­
cumbed to the Sunday indolence so natural to a commerçant? And 
today I see from a commercial circular that a STEAMER is in fact 
leaving the day after tomorrow. I have begun to work, b but 
nothing is ready. I have Pindar coming to see me this evening and 
even if I sent him away, I doubt whether I should get anything 
done in the few hours before the last post. Doncc you and I have 
been duped. But I shall never again make the mistake of believing 
the commercial intelligence provided by the organ of the 
bourgeoisie.

As to 1. Present: Kinkel, Willich, Reichenbach, Löwe of Calbe, 
Meyen, Schurz (not Techow this time), Schimmelpfennig, Imandt; 
I know of no others. Not forgetting Schärttner. 
Kinkel had had the indispensable third member (Techow) of the 
alliance 3 elected in America and Switzerland. There still remained 
the participation in the election of the 12-15 London guarantors. 
Here, as I told you, the election of Techow fell through and then 
he declared that he could not accept as he was leaving for 
Australia.b 
Kinkel proposed to proceed with a new election of the third 
man. Fell through again. 
Löwe of Calbe: First: 'The German loan has miscarried because 
the political circumstances (May 1852 186) in view of which it was 
undertaken are no longer present, and the presupposed amount 
of 20,000 dollars has not been raised.'  Second:  'The monies to be 
returned to the American committees.' 
The first part of this motion was carried, the second rejected. 
Imandt: 'If the majority of the remaining guarantors share my 
view, the money to hand should be used to publish a German 
newspaper in London.' 'Reichenbach will remain TRUSTEE of the 
money.' 'A committee is to be elected consisting of Reichenbach, 
Löwe and Schimmelpfennig, and Kinkel and Willich will hand 
over to it the lists of the guarantors in America and Switzerland; 
the previous committee has nothing more to do with the matter; 
the new committee will advise the guarantors abroad of the 
resolutions taken and will obtain their opinion.' 
Reichenbach supported Imandt's motions, all were carried. 
Kinkel and Willich protested on the grounds that the disposal of 
the money did not rest solely with the body of guarantors. Only 
the donors of the money, or respectively the finance committees 
set up in America, could exercise the right of disposal. 
Sic transit gloria? Willich is more determined than ever to go t'o 
America, provided he can raise the fare. 
As to 2. Meeting called by Finance Minister Goegg, back from 
America without finances. 
Present: In the chair: 'Damm' himself (not yet slipped off to 
Australia). Goegg. Ronge. Dr Strauss. Sigel, the other one. d Franck 
(from Vienna). Oswald. Dralle. (These all 'agitators'. 6) Kinkel.

date Hentze from Königsberg. Garthe. A stripling (unknown) from 
Vienna. 
Goegg opened the sitting, described his activity in America, 
owing to which birth was given to a revolutionary league,173 an act 
as a result of which the American Republic was supposed to be 
'tumbled' and hence birth to be given to a German-Baden 
republic—the victory of the American Democrats over the Whigs 
to be ensured, etc. The modest young man further asserted (an 
opinion attested by the newly arrived candidate of philosophy 
Hentze) that Germans in all provinces stood with their eyes fixed 
on London so that, at the crucial moment when those present at 
the meeting fell into each other's arms, they could let out a 
thunderous hurrah that would resound across the ocean a 
thousand times o'er. Hence he demanded that the meeting 
constitute itself a branch of the Revolutionary League and no 
longer leave their poor compatriots to languish in that attitude of 
expectancy. 
Imandt: Thanked Goegg for his information on American 
conditions. Suggested moreover that the meeting should disperse, 
since only a general and publicly convened meeting of refugees 
could take a decision. 
Damm ruled him out of order. 
Kinkel: (Already during Goegg's eloquent speech, this sensitive 
poet-martyr had, by rolling his eyes, signified his irrevocable 
determination to spread out his arms in reconciliation). He, too, 
was aware that Germany was looking to them. He was in a position 
to clasp the conciliatory hand. As a sacrifice to the cause, he would 
forget the grave injustice he had suffered. He, too, was aware that 
not only the liberation of Germany, but also the revolutionising of 
America, lay in their hands. None so great, said he, in an allusion 
to Ruge's 'agent of the Prince of Prussia', a as he who mastered 
himself.  However he, for his part, demanded that the Revolution­
ary League should also now guarantee his loan. Even though he 
and the 'honourable' Willich might not see eye to eye politically, 
nevertheless they would, he believed, have achieved great things 
together. 
Imandt: Respected the Christian humility of Kinkel who had 
forgotten that Ruge had called him an agent of the Prince of 
Prussia, who had, for sheer love of the revolution, had repressed 
the indignation in his burning breast which, 2 months earlier 
a See this volume, pp.  150-51. 

=====第188页=====
156 79. Marx to Engels. 10 August 1852 
(May),  had prompted, in the presence of the guarantors, the 
solemn declaration: 'as a good republican, he could only regard as 
injurious to his honour the suggestion that he should go with 
Ruge, his wicked detractor, and, rather than reconcile himself with 
the wicked Ruge, would retire from all political activity'. It was out 
of Christian humility that Kinkel had drained the bitter cup which 
Fickler had prepared for him with his horribly insulting letters (in 
one of those letters Fickler had described him as 'a turkey 
strutting on a dung-heap'); he had become, as indeed Goegg's 
friends maintained he had always been, simple of heart if he could 
bring himself to fall into the arms of his American rivals. The 
'union' between Messrs Kinkel and Goegg was a fine thing, for 
although it really had no other purpose than that the former with 
the help of the latter should strive to get the upper hand in the 
administration of the loan funds, and that the latter with the help 
of the former should seek to worm his way into that administra­
tion, yet a peace agreement between two men of such stature 
might nevertheless ensure that the political parties throughout the 
world similarly became reconciled, that the constitutionalist held 
out his hand to the republican and the socialist to the republican, 
that henceforward the proletarians would no longer be exploited 
by the bourgeois and, in short, that everyone would embrace every 
one else and shout hip-hip-hurray. For the fact of Kinkel's having 
said in America that he regarded the proletarians as cannon 
fodder (as once in Bonn and Cologne he had adulated Cavaignac) 
and this, despite his alliance with the 'honourable' Willich, did not 
affect the issue. There was at most one trifling matter outstanding: 
like all people who, instead of studying the difference between the 
various parties and championing their interests, indulged in 
scatter-brained folly about uniting opposing elements, Kinkel 
could be reproached with a total lack of principle, etc. He would 
further draw Kinkel's attention to the fact that he could at most 
conclude agreements on his  behalf,  but not on behalf of the body 
of guarantors. Finally, Imandt moved that the Revolutionary 
League in America be left to its own devices and that all should go 
home. Whereupon Imandt went. 
Incidents: Damm constantly interrupted Imandt and wanted to 
rule him out of order. As a Rhinelander, the tipsy Herweg felt 
obliged, so long as Imandt was present, to manifest approbation 
and, while Imandt was speaking of 'great men', he 'lorgnetted' the 
company with his pipe. During the passage about 'the 
proletarians', the painter, Franck, rose in indignation and said: 'I 
can't stand it any more. I grunt.' Imandt replied that this was 

=====第189页=====
80. Engels to Marx. 16 August 1852 157 
something he had in common with other animals, whereupon 
Franck decamped. Kinkel denied the 'cannon fodder'. Imandt told 
the whole story about Schnauffer and the Wecker, whereat Kinkel 
fell silent. At the word 'Cavaignac', he again broke in: 'Citizen 
Imandt, when did the Bonner Zeitung appear?' Imandt: It was all 
the same to him whether it had been before or after the June 
insurrection. He had read about the thing  himself. 
Conclusion: The sitting went on for 2 more hours. Goegg 
pleaded that they should join the Revolutionary League, at least 
temporarily. The afore-mentioned stripling from Vienna declared 
anyone who delayed in joining by so much as an hour to be a 
'traitor to his country'. Nevertheless, after the majority had 
rejected every, I repeat, every motion, the company went home 
without having founded a branch of the American-European-
Australian Revolutionary League.

Dear Marx, 
This evening I have been promised the £2 borrowed from me a 
short while ago; if I get it, I shall send you it at once tomorrow by 
P.O.  order and shall also write at great length. 
Since we've heard nothing further from Weydemeyer and, 
according to Cluss' letters, the things seem at last to have been 
sent off, a it might be advisable for us to inquire from Edwards, 
Sanford and Co. in Liverpool whether they have received any

packages. If you hear nothing more (last night the  STEAMER  had not 
yet arrived), I, at any rate, could do that. 
From your report it would seem that the resolutions of 
3 [August] have for the present snatched the money from Mr 
Kinkel's grasp.a  Mr Imandt does pretty well for himself after his 
own fashion.  C'est  drôle, quand un Schapper nous échappe, un Imandt 
est toujours sûr de revenir à nous. h But he is at any rate a deus 
minimorum gentium, canis domesticus communismi germanica and as 
such is useful, since we have now learnt to keep lesser folk of this 
kind on a short rein. 
The noble Willich's bosom must be much lacerated now that 
separation from the emigration's coffre-fort'1  has sprung the last 
band holding his noble consciousness together. He must, 
moreover, have notified his trusties over there long ago of his 
arrival since the latter, on the strength of an important letter from 
Willich, have already convened big extraordinary general meet­
ings.  Mr Willich will become head of the  LOAFERS  and  ROWDIES  there, 
and as such will have a rare opportunity of distinguishing  himself. 
What is more, he will also find his old enemy Schramm e there, 
and that will lead to some pretty rows. 
How delectable that Mr Kossuth has actually already caused 
companies to be drilled and Napoleon-Sigel is playing the 
instructor of the recruits. What an unspeakable swindler this 
Kossuth is; driving him out of America was one of the most 
splendid coups ever perpetrated by Cluss.184 
By the way I shall very soon be doing the Hungarian campaign' 
and shall write direct to Brockhaus this very week. If he has no 
faith in my military qualifications, I shall arrange previously to do 
one or two cogent articles for the Gegenwart so that he can see 
what there is to them. Dronke's connection with Brockhaus is very 
good and must be exploited. For Brockhaus is after all one of the 
more tractable booksellers. Nous allons voir? 
I was interrupted while writing the article for Danah last 
Thursday and shall, if possible, make up for it by doing 2 this 
week. I also expect something more from you on England.18 Last

Letters have arrived from Cluss which I shall send you as soon 
as I have shown them to Lupus and the little League.189 
As regards Weydemeyer, Cluss writes as follows3: 
'Not long ago, after some goading on my part, Weydemeyer wrote that he 
would have to put serious pressure on Korff who was supposed to have sent off the 
50 Brumaires. Weydemeyer has, I believe, small sums owing to him from Korff 
and will therefore have charged him with the dispatch, and/or payment of the 
postai costs. 
'The remaining 300 Brumaires ... not yet dispatched ... He claims that 500 
copies are still held at the printers as a security and he hasn't yet been able to 
redeem them, etc. ... Financially, for one thing I cannot under any circumstances 
intervene just now, and for another I would not wish to do so even if I could. For 
time and again I have been told that such and such a sum would resolve 
everything, and time and again such and such a sum has been provided and 
resolved nothing. When the Revolution began, we were told to have faith and send 
in advance-payments without delay. I at once sent subscriptions to the tune of 10 
dollars, which /, of course, subsequently lost... Later it was said that the periodical 
was being put on its feet again and I was to find 20 dollars to that end; 18 dollars 
went off forthwith, 15 dollars from me personally and 3 dollars subscriptions. 
Instead of being used to carry on the business, this went to pay for the same old stupid 
bag of tricks, i.e. for the first 2 issues which had been sent out at random. The 
Brumaire arrived. Weydemeyer in despair. I told him I would instantly contribute 
25-30 dollars if that would help, otherwise he was to send me the manuscript. Send 
me 25 dollars, he says; I do so. After a while it transpires that only 500 copies can 
be printed with the money available; no good, I tell him, how much more would it 
cost to print  1,000?  20 dollars, comes the reply, and the next day the money is 
already on its way. 
'Now the poemsc arrive; they are to be printed in New York; when I insist that 
the nonsense must cease and the printing begin, I get the poems back, it having 
unfortunately proved impossible to print them just now in New York. I-at once

have them printed and bound for some 15 dollars (400 copies2) and send the stuff 
off in all haste so that it can be disposed of at the choral festival just then taking 
place in New York. They were touted round by one solitary vendorb who is said to 
have actually disposed of 60 (!) copies. So the printing of the 2nd thousand (I had 
left the type set up), the money for which Weydemeyer had promised to provide as 
he had already informed me, was, of course, stopped; and in the same way, the 
whole business appears to have remained inert and lifeless in his hands ever since. 
'I shall write and tell Weydemeyer that, in so far as I am financially involved in 
this affair, I want you to use it in Europe for further publications in the interests of 
the party, or in any other way you yourself think fit, hence that so far as my share in 
all this is concerned, to send no money to America. In the case of the poems, I 
alone am involved, and so I alone have the final say in the matter. 
'I shall therefore stake everything on getting the stuff sent off.' 
Isn't that an exact replica of our Brussels-Westphalian aven­
ture} 190 Last week I wrote to F. Streit in Coburg about the printing 
of the Brumaire; he deals in articles of this kind. 191

Feuerbach-Stirner; and since the Revolutionary League173 is going 
to pot, the 'aristocrat of the intellect' proposes a 'humanist' union. 
In addition I have the following to report: 
On the 3rd, Kinkel and the coffre-fort d were duly divorced. 
Reichenbach deposited the money in the Bank of England in his 
own name. 
At this gathering Kinkel feigned ignorance of the meeting 
convoked by Goegg and hence challenged Imandt in public to 
read out in public the invitation he had received. On the 6th, 
however, Goegg, turning to Kinkel, remarked: 'in accordance with 
the arrangement I made with you at your house'. Willich was not 
present. 
Hentze, the candidate, endorsed all his own remarks by adding: 
'as a D. Phil. I ought to know'. 
Goegg explained how his Revolutionary League 1. provided a 
stay and support for Germans in America, 2. might, by 
influencing the elections, sway American policy and induce the 
United States to adopt a policy of intervention. On the material 
side,  too, a start had been made. Contributions of one cent per 
week.  BOXES  in all public houses. Gottfried declared himself in 
agreement with all this. Only, he opined, contributions of a dollar 
would be preferable to contributions of a cent, no one in America

Revolution in Germany, XV. - d strong-box

having sufficient patriotic devotion to count up the cents. He also 
came out against BOXES. 
Quoth the great Kinkel, staring hard at Imandt the while: 
'Despite all the calumnies that have been spread against'me, I can stand up with 
unruffled brow and say that I have never spoken ill of any exiled fellow 
citizen—not a single one.'* 
Consequence: Since Kinkel had no money, but only his esteemed 
person, to offer by way of dowry, the latter was spurned, despite 
all his boot-licking and self-humiliation. The eight dynasts 
organised themselves into a Revolutionary League off their own 
bat and without co-opting Kinkel. The malheureuxl b 
Schmölze, a born painter, is said to have done a rather nice set 
of cartoons, Kinkel as King Lear and Willich as the Fool. Also a 
cartoon in which Willich, as a sloth, squats in a fruit-tree while Mrs 
Schärttner on the ground shakes the tree to dislodge him. 
Willich has been stupid enough to extend his ostracism to the 
honourable and elderly Mr 'Schily' and to expel him from his little 
League 189 for all sorts of imaginary crimes. Schily is appealing to a 
general meeting. Today is the day of the ordeal. For his part 
Schily accuses Willich of 'unmistakable insanity', as a proof of which 
he will this evening produce a letter from Heise, Willich's alleged 
friend in Liverpool, wherein Heise describes Willich as mentally 
deranged. 
Last week friend Jones came within an ace of losing his 
newspaper/ Every week a deficit. At odds with the committee l92 
and with the 2 citizens who have so far been putting up the 
money. Sudden reprieve. MacGowan has taken over publication, 
will make good the weekly deficit, and Jones is now ensconced in 
the office of the old Northern Star. MacGowan has sacked Harney, 
and the idiot bought the old Star from him for £40. 
According to the Gazette Agricole, the next harvest in France will 
be Vs BEiow THE AVERAGE which in France, according to J. B. Say,=

already an outflow of gold from the Bank for corn purchases. At

Dear Sir, 
I am writing to you to ask whether you could use in your 
Gegenwart a paper on 'Recent Literature on the Economy in 
England, from 1830-1852'. So far as I am aware, no work of this 
kind has yet been published either in English or in German. It 
would cover 1. general works on political economy, 2. specialised 
writings which appeared during that period, in so far as they 
relate to really important controversies, for instance on popula­
tion, the colonies, the banking question, protective tariffs and free 
trade, etc. 
Should you feel inclined to fall in with this proposal, I should 
have to know the length prescribed for such a paper by the 
economics of your publication, since the subdivision of the whole 
would have to be arranged accordingly. 
Another paper which might perhaps be pertinent just now is 
'The Present State of the Parties', i.e. those that will confront each 
other in the next Parliament. Awaiting your reply, I am

Dear Marx, 
This evening I shall translate the final part of your article 193 and 
shall do the article on 'Germany'3 tomorrow or Thursday. 
Charlesb has gone away for a few days and I have a great deal to 
do in the office so that by evening my mind is often in a whirl. 
Thanks for the suggestions on military history.0 Could you 
sometime have a look in the British Museum to see if they have 
1. The Oesterreichische Militärische Zeitschrift from 1848 onwards, 
2. the Prussian Militär-Wochenblatt, the Berlin Wehr-Zeitung, 3. any 
other military periodicals, especially reviews, including French 
ones—from 1848 onwards? Also a set of the Augsburg Allg. Ztg., 
particularly from 1850. I need these things very badly and, if it 
could somehow be arranged, would find time to work through 
them there, when I have got to that stage. 
The excerpt from Cluss' letterd  shows up père" Weydemeyer in 
an even more Westphalian light !94 than we had ever expected. 
Bielefeld tout pur.1 It beats everything. 
Johann Gottfried's 8 end is pleasing indeed. All that is left to the 
noble fellow is the cold comfort of knowing that he has done his 
duty and swollen the STOCK OK BULLION in the Bank of England. 
Furthermore, in fixing a new date for the liberation of the world, 
he had based  himself,  not on vague trade crises, but on hard, 
ineluctable fact, namely a spurious document in The Morning 
Chronicle  ! 
The Willich-Schily farceh  must have been a hilarious perform­
ance.  Pauvre' Willich, how often during his harassment by the 
philistines must he have wished himself back in red Wolff's' 
company! 
So Harney's star of freedom has faded away? 195

show signs of being passable, and in places even good. Here the 
recent good weather has likewise borne fruit. But France is still in 
the soup, and that's enough to be going on with. 
The minor  PANIC  in the money market appears to be over, CONSOLS 
and RAILWAY SHARES are again rising merrily, MONEY IS EASIER, specula­
tion is still pretty evenly distributed over CORN, COTTON, STEAM BOATS, 
MINING OPERATIONS, etc., etc. But cotton has already become a very 
risky proposition; despite what is so far a very promising crop, 
prices are rising continuously, merely as a result of high 
consumption and the possibility of a brief cotton shortage before 
fresh imports can arrive. Anyway I don't believe that the crisis will 
this time be preceded by a regular rage for speculation; if 
circumstances are favourable in other respects, a few mails 
bringing bad news from India, a  PANIC:  in New York, etc., will very 
soon prove that many a virtuous citizen has been up to all kinds of 
sharp practice on the quiet. And these crucial ill-tidings from 
overstocked markets must surely come soon. Massive shipments 
continue to leave for China and India, and yet the advices are 
nothing out of the ordinary; indeed, Calcutta is DECIDEDLY OVER­
STOCKED, and here and there NATIVE DEALERS are going bankrupt. I 
don't believe that PROSPERITY will continue beyond October or 
November—even Peter Ermen is becoming worried. 
At all events, whether a revolution is immediately produced— 
immediately, i.e. in 6-8 months—very largely depends on the 
intensity of the crisis. The poor harvest in France makes it look as 
though something is going to happen there; but if the crisis 
becomes chronic and the harvest turns out after all a little better 
than expected, we might even have to wait until 1854. I admit that 
I should like another year in which to swot, having still a good 
deal of stuff to get through. 
Australia also does some harm. First, directly through her gold 
and the stoppage of all her other exports, as also through the 
correspondingly heavier imports of all COMMODITIES and the fact that 
she is draining off the  SURPLUS  POPULATION here  AT THE  RATE  OF 5,000  A WEEK. 
California and Australia are two cases which were not foreseen in 
the Manifesto3: creation of large new markets out of nothing. They 
will have to be included. Your

You will find enclosed: 
1. Letter from Massol to me. The man upon whom he exerts 
influence is Proudhon, and the book which he regards as the 
happy (!) fruit of that influence is the latter's most recent book on 
Louis Bonaparte/ I shall be writing about this in one of my next

5. and 6. "Draft of a treaty of union' between Kinkel, Willich 
and Goegg. A circular letter from the first-named gentlemen to 
their American committees and guarantors. 197 
The whole is a cry of distress from Kinkel-Willich. They wish 
1. to remove the inflexible Reichenbach from the proximity of the 
Holy Grail l98 so that they may use the funds 'with the utmost 
dispatch'. 
2. Now that Kinkel no longer has an army behind him he wants 
to join the so-called Revolutionary League with £1,000 behind 
him, expecting the said League to show its gratitude by electing 
him to its highest committee. 
3. Willich, hard-pressed and in an untenable position, wants-to 
go to America once he has, as he puts it, 'solved one more 
problem'. The problem is to feather a parasitical swindler's nest 
for himself in America by handing over the £1,000 to the 
Revolutionary League and by joining same. 
More next time. Salut!

MARX TO PETER IMANDT 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 27 August 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Imandt, 
2 truly memorable memoranda!197 If that's not champion 
drivel3 ... or however the saying goes. 
However, in your place I would reply to the lads™9 : 
At your guarantors' meeting you nominated a committee 
(provisional), consisting of Reichenbach, Löwe and Schurz, to 
settle matters. You were to await that committee's report. Kinkel 
and Willich were in no way empowered either to ask questions or 
to receive answers. Their threat that anyone in Europe failing to 
answer by 1 September (extremely short notice) would be held to 
be in agreement with them, is merely an attempt by them and Co., 
after their failure at the meeting, to take over the administration of 
the funds by stealth. You should protest against this procedure and 
say you will, if necessary, publish your protest with your full 
reasons for it. 
At the same time I would write to Reichenbach: 
Repeat the foregoing and declare that he must see to it that not 
a centime is paid out until the committee nominated by yourselves has 
submitted its report. Draw his attention to a few of the chief points 
of the document, but more especially to the following: 
'In order that we may make use of the funds if need arise, we propose that the 
guarantors in America accord us with the utmost dispatch the right to co-opt a 
third colleague. In which case we should elect either Goegg or some other local 
member of the Revolutionary League, etc' 20° 
I.e. what the gentlemen have in mind is to get the money out of 
Reichenbach's hands 'with the utmost dispatch' because great 'need 
has now arisen' for Willich and Co. to 'make use of the funds'. 
You could slip into both these letters a few jokes about the 
'treaty of union'.b

ich nicht, was besser ist.' - b See this volume, p. 166.

MARX TO ENGELS 182 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 30 August 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
You will have seen from the documents I sent you how 
Kinkel-Willich are manoeuvring.15  They are ignoring their deposi­
tion by the guarantors in their immediate vicinity and are 
endeavouring to obtain individual votes by stealth, which is partly 
why Schurz left for America immediately after the 12th. (A further 
object is to set up kindergartens there, of the Friends of Light. 201) 
What the gentlemen have in mind is at long last to play a real role 
in the administration of the funds, from which they threaten to 
resign if not given their way. The point d'argenf is this. The chaps 
have spent £200, which would hardly be ratified here. Hence the 
attempt to obtain from America, directly and 'with the utmost 
dispatch', authority to make use of the funds or to co-opt a third 
colleague so that they may act as a properly constituted body. 
They have, after their usual fashion, set about things very artfully. 
First, they sent the documents to America and Switzerland, behind 
the backs of the London guarantors. Then the letters were 
delivered to the latter on the 26th (although dated 11 and 12), 
with the remark that silence would be taken for consent.

But since there is a possibility that the majority of the 
guarantors, even in America and Switzerland, might vote against 
these gentlemen, they have, on the quiet, called a meeting of 
guarantors (friends of Kinkel) for 14 or 15 September in Antwerp, 
in order to safeguard themselves against all eventualities by means 
of an alleged congress resolution. 
The nature of their much-vaunted 'strong' organisations in 
Germany will be plain to you from the following. 
As you know, Gebert has allegedly left for America. Tout le 
monde le croit" But this is how things really stand. 
At the beginning of this month Kinkel-Willich sent an emissary 
to Germany, i.e. Gebert, the tipsy journeyman tailor. In Magdeburg 
he assembled a so-called communist community; for 3 consecutive 
days discussions were held, 26-30 members taking part; in the 
chair was one Hammel; during the debates Marx and Engels were 
attacked with much acrimony;—in addition to various administra­
tive and organisational questions there arose the question of how 
and in what manner a printing-house might be set up. They 
succeeded in finding an impoverished printer of books with a 
business in or near Magdeburg and concluded an agreement with 
him. He placed his office at their disposal for propaganda, the 
name of the firm being retained. In return he was paid 100 talers 
down and given a bill of exchange for 350 talers, maturing in a 
year's time reckoning from now. 
The police knew about everything, beginning with Gebert's 
departure, and had him followed everywhere. They had their 
informant at the loutish gathering in Magdeburg. They don't 
intend to pull him in until he has completed his mission and 
compromised as many people as possible. The affair is most 
unfortunate for our prisoners in Cologne. If Gebert is pulled in, 
etc., I think the time would be ripe to denounce the fellows 
publicly and to issue a warning about them, namely that, from a 
secure hiding-place, they are playing into the hands of the 
German governments, especially the Prussian, for the purpose of 
pseudo-agitation and self-aggrandisement. I notified Cologne 
immediately. I can tell you only by word of mouth how I found out 
about the business.202 Over here, too, secrecy of mails is somewhat 
problematic. 
Willich is quite gone to the dogs. He can no longer borrow from 
anyone on the strength of the imminence of 'the great day'. A few 
days ago his friend Schärttner told him coram publico* that 'free' 
a Everybody believes this. - b in public

grub and booze must now cease. He turned red as a turkey-cock 
and the implacable Schärttner, promptly suiting action to word, 
insisted on his paying cash for the pots he had just imbibed. 
However Willich still obtains some, if inadequate, sustenance by 
tumbling his old philistine of a landlady. That, too, has become 
notorious and no one any longer believes in the asceticism of this 
Sancho Panza. When, together with Johann, 3 etc., he writes, 'the 
time of the pen is past, the time of the sword has come', 203 this last 
should read IN PI.AIN GERMAN: 'The time of fencing has come.'b 
Techow, the revolutionary general, is only sailing for Australia 
in a few days, accompanied by Madame Stirnerc  and his fiancée. 
As you know, he has for some time been staying here with the 
Stirner woman. But then his fiancée arrives, a person of substance. 
Upon becoming aware of this, the Schmidt woman declares she 
will stand down. But now the fiancée, on learning that Techow has 
been living with the Schmidt woman, declares she no longer wants 
him and sends for her potential fiancé, an East Prussian farmer. 
Nevertheless he lives in the same house as  herself,  and the fiancé 
(the other one) an hour away from London. Poor Buridan-
Techow! 
A few days ago Pyat (Félix) called a reunion of his French 
adherents and laid before them a programme which is now to be 
published. Needless to say, 'God' had had a hand in it. One of 
those present objected to 'Cod' finding lodgment in a revolution­
ary programme. In conformity with gouvernement direct^ Pyat put 
it to the vote. 'God' got by with a majority of 7. L'être suprême est 
sauvé encore une fois. e God doth not forsake his own, as the saying 
used to go. Now it is: God's own do not forsake him. One good 
turn deserves another. 
For a long time General Vetter was not seen in London; no one 
knew where he had gone. The mystère has now been cleared up. 
Vetter was travelling on an American passport, in which he figures 
as a painter, accompanied by his mistress, a singer named 
Ferenczi. He passed for an artist. She gave concerts at all places of 
importance and thus he travelled from Genoa and Milan to Rome, 
Naples and Palermo. Mazzini-Kossuth had provided him with 
PASSWORDS and recommendations. This gave him access to clandes­
tine circles in Italy, while his ostensible TRADE introduced him into

the higher cercles? He came back here some time ago and 
submitted a report to the 'European' Central «Committee. 103 
(Notabene: Darasz died and was buried last week.) In  brief,  to the 
great mortification of the 'pious' Mazzini, L'Italie s'est tout à fait 
matérialisée. On n'y parle que commerce, affaires, soies, huiles et autres 
misères mondaines. Les bourgeois calculent d'une manière terriblement 
positive les pertes que la révolution de Mars les a fait subir et ne pensent 
qu'à se reprendre sur le présent. Quant à l'initiative insurrectionnelle ils 
sont heureux de la laisser aux Français, à ce peuple frivole et sensualiste. 
La seule  chose,  dont ils ont peur, c'est que les Français ne se hâtent trop. 
Tu penses bien, mon cher, quel coup de foudre pour l'archange 
Mazzini. Le général Vetter, nommé déjà comme commandant supérieur 
des forces Mazzini-Kossuthiennes leur a déclaré que les  choses  étant ainsi, 
il ne saurait mieux faire que de passer avec sa maîtresse en Amérique. 
Au bout du compte, le malheureux Mazzini est convenu avec Kossuth de 
vouloir bien laisser aux Français l'initiative insurrectionnelle! 3 
Not to the vile multitude,0 however, but to Bonaparte. 
I have had a letter from Paris'1 about this and other matters: 
'Kiss,  Kossuth's ambassador, has entered into relations here, not only with the 
Orleanists, but also with the Bonapartists. Kiss is acquainted with Jerome'se sons. 
On the strength of this formal acquaintanceship, he was able to bamboozle Kossuth 
into concluding with the French government an alliance favourable to Hungary. 
The whimsical agitator fell into the trap and to this end dispatched Kiss to Paris, 
provided with gulden. Kiss enjoys himself in coffee and other houses, from time to 
time appears in the antechamber of Pierre Bonaparte, pulls the wool over the 
latter's eyes, writes splendid reports to Kossuth, and Hungary's liberation is no 
longer in doubt. These revolutionaries par  excellence  send agents to conclude a life 
and death alliance with a "tyrant"'.' 
a circles - b Italy has grown wholly materialist. The sole topics of conversation 
there are commerce, business, silks, oils and other wretchedly mundane things. The 
bourgeois reckon in the most dreadfully positive way the losses they incurred as a 
result of the March revolution and think only how they may recoup them from the 
present. As for insurrectionary initiative, they are glad to leave this to that frivolous 
and sensual people, the French. Their only fear is that the French might be in too 
much hurry. 
You can imagine, my friend, what a thunderbolt this was to the Archangel 
Mazzini. General Vetter, already appointed commander-in-chief of the Mazzini-
Kossuthian forces, told them that in the circumstances he could do no better than 
betake himself to America with his mistress. In the final count, the unfortunate 
Mazzini agreed with Kossuth that insurrectionary initiative was best left to the 
French. - c These words were used by Thiers in his speech in the Legislative 
Assembly on 24 May 1850, Le Moniteur universel, No. 145, 25 May 1850. - d from

I have it from a reliable source that that old fool Lelewel and 
Thaddäus Gorzowski have been here on behalf of the Polish 
'Centralisation'. 204 They submitted to Kossuth-Mazzini an insurrec­
tionary plan of which Bonaparte's co-operation is the PIVOT. These 
old jackasses of conspirators are always putting their foot in it. 
They had, and continue to have, as agent here a certain Count 
Lanckoronski or some such. This lad (lives at 7 Harington Street,

plan was done the honour of being amended beforehand in

tion of the funds—which Reichenbach is withholding from 
them—are behaving as though they propose to withdraw from it 
now, unless allowed to do as they please. What they really want is 
to get at it. 
The point d'argent 3 is as follows: The chaps have spent £200, 
which would hardly be ratified here. By this coup, by the special 
powers they have received from the other guarantors, they hope 
to get the money out of Reichenbach's clutches and, above all, to 
make good the £200. This was their ploy: First, they send the 
documents of 11 and 12 August to America and Switzerland, 
behind the backs of the London guarantors. Then the letter was 
delivered to the latter on the 26th with the instruction that, if they 
failed to answer by 1 September, their silence would be taken for 
consent. 
What will Weitling say on learning that the money will now be 
indirectly finding its way to the worthy Heinzen? The gentlemen 
were likewise careful not to mention that, despite Kinkel's 
recommendation and Goegg's pleading, the Revolutionary 
League's attempt to establish itself over here was a lamentable 
failure. Not a man allowed himself to be moved by them. What 
they now call the Revolutionary League in London is Ruge's

intention to bring them the £1,000 by way of a dowry. Schärttner

Willich's league. Willich's position in London has become com­

for Australia with Madame Schmidt (Stirner's wife). He has been 
living with her in this country for some time. But along comes his

down. Then his affianced acquires another 'fiancé' and says she 
doesn't want Techow any more because of his having lived with 
the Schmidt woman, and that she is going to marry the other man. 
Nevertheless he lives in the same house as  herself,  and the fiancé 
(the other one) a few miles outside London. Poor Buridan-

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 2 September 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
From the enclosed pissabed letter from the great Weydemeyer, 
you will see how matters stand. With it the brute sent 10 copies.3 
I have not yet had an answer from Mr F. Streit, b ce qui est de très 
mauvais augure. c There is now some, if little, prospect of its being 
published in English by a London bookseller. For the time being I 
am to give him the first chapter by way of a sample. I have 
therefore had it translated by Pieper. The translation is swarming 
with mistakes and omissions. However, its correction will not be 
such an imposition on you as the boring task of translation. 11 I 
would like you to write an English preface of not more than 10 
lines,  saying that this paper originally appeared in the form of 
newspaper articles between the end of December and the 
beginning of February, that it was published as a pamphlet in New 
York on 1 May, that a 2nd edition is now to appear in Germany,209 
and that it was the first anti-Bonaparte paper to appear; the few 
details no longer of relevance may be accounted for by its date of 
origin. 
E. Jones is a thoroughly egotistical rascal. For 2 months he has 
been dangling before me the promise that he will do a translation 
(for his journale ). For my part, I have done him nothing but 
favours. In spite of my own money bothers I have spent days with 
him traipsing all over the place in connection with his paper's 
financial affairs. All the foreign intelligence exclusive to his pauvre 1 
little paper came from me. Whenever he got into a scrape with his 
1Q9 . . . 
committees, opponents, etc., he came running to me, and my 
advice invariably got him out of it. Finally, when his journal 
became altogether too deplorable, I gave him my EDITORIAL SUPPORT 
for several weeks, and indeed the wretched thing gained some 
100 additional subscribers in London.

He, for his part, does not even observe the common civilities. 
Help him concoct his journal today and he'll forget to send you a 
copy tomorrow, but this forgetfulness recurs every seven days since 
his paper does not come out twice a week. 
I have told him it's all very well to be an egotist but he should 
be so in a civilised way and not so inanely. Since, however, the 
paper is the only Chartist organ, I shall not break with him but  LET 
HIM SHIFT FOR HIMSELF for a few weeks.

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS210 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London, 3 September 1852] 
It has been put about here that Gebert, a bottle-loving 
journeyman tailor and a myrmidon of Willich's, had left for 
America. That is not so. At the beginning of August Kinkel and 
Willich sent him to Germany as their emissary. 
As these people harp on 'organisations' in their circular—the 
last one to the guarantors—and on the whole have no connections 
in Germany, the remnants of the Communist League there who 
for one reason or another have no contact with Cologne were to 
provide a semblance of, and pretext for, such 'organisations'.3  And 
then the gentlemen also had to account for the sum of £200. 
Hence a certain sum of money had to be spent in one quarter or 
another in such a manner that it could decently be described as 
'revolutionary expenditure'. They hoped the remainder of what 
had been spent could then be more easily passed off. Finally, 
Marx, Engels and co. were to be destroyed (sic) in the eyes of 
working men in Germany. Kinkel thought that, having begged 
a See this volume, p. 169.

and lied his way into the esteem of the remnants of the 
Communist League, he could palm off the latter on to his 
bourgeois guarantors as a bourgeois-democratic connection. Willich, 
the representative imposed upon the German workers by himself 
and Kinkel, at last saw a chance of creating for himself a real 
following of workers in Germany. 
To continue. In Magdeburg, Gebert assembled a so-called 
communist community; for 3 consecutive days discussions were 
held, 26-30 members taking part; in the chair was one Hammel 
(nomen omen*); during the debates Marx and Engels were attacked 
with much acrimony, the main task laid down being to destroy 
them, their influence and their 'doctrines'. (Brother Hammel may 
not find this last so easy.) In addition to various administrative and 
organisational questions, there arose the question of how and in 
what manner a printing-house might be set up. They succeeded in 
finding an impoverished printer of books with a business in or 
near Magdeburg and concluded an agreement with him. He 
placed his office at their disposal for propaganda, the name of the 
firm being retained as it was. In return he was paid 100 talers 
down and given a bill of exchange for 350 talers, which he is to 
receive after one year. 
Thus the revolutionary funds are to serve the purpose of 
propaganda for that creature, Kinkel-Willich, and of promoting 
intrigue to split up the 'organisations' in Germany. 
But the best is still to come. The Prussian police were informed of 
everything from the moment the innocuous Gebert left London, 
whereas everyone here imagined he had slipped off to America. 
The government had its informant at the loutish assembly at 
Magdeburg; he took down the entire debate in shorthand. Gebert, 
who has now gone to Berlin, had a Prussian policeman in train. 
He is not allowed out of sight for an instant. The government 
intend to allow him to fulfil his mission, by which time he will 
have compromised dozens of others besides  himself. 
I have this intelligence— Willich, too, has been bragging about 
his 'agents' in Germany—from a Prussian police headquarters in 
which I have planted a séid. b2n2 
Qu'en dis-tu?c  So these knaves are providing the Prussian 
government with an opportunity to introduce fresh complications 
into the Cologne trial, etc.

do you say to that?

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] Tuesday, 7 September 1852 
Dear Marx, 
I am having a great deal of trouble over Pieper's translation.2 
The beginning is particularly difficult to translate and l'aimable 
candidar Pieper seems to have given rein to charming 
lightheartedness. If possible, I'll let you have it on Thursday. 
Pindar has been involved in a romance up here. I don't know 
whether I have already told you this, but recently I went to his 
house and found his mother there,  A VERY  RESPECTABLE  OLD  ENGLISH LADY, 
with a young lady of very un-English appearance whom I took to 
be a Russian. Last Friday I asked Pindar whether this krasnàvitza 
{beauté) was his wife or his sister— ni l'un ni  l'autre, 11 was the reply. 
On Monday his mother comes to my house: her dear Edward had 
gone, vanished. I wasn't in but, hearing about it, at once went to 
see her. Je trouve la digne mère en pleurs d and am told the 
following: In Petersburg Pindar fell madly in love with a Swede 
(or Finn) with whom, it seems, he ran away after his father's 
death. He married her in England—'her' being the afore-said 
krasnàvitza. In London he makes the acquaintance of a Frenchwom­
an— an erstwhile Parisian whore and mistress of an English 
Grub Street dramatist by the name of Taylor, says his rriother 
who,  of course, makes her out to be a thoroughly bad lot. He gives 
her lessons, and the quiet candidate becomes amorously entangled 
with her. His wife discovers the affair (in the meantime his mother 
had come over from Kronstadt with some money and had made 
her peace with the Swedish woman) and, to wean Pindar from the 
Frenchwoman, the whole family moves to Liverpool. But again he 
sends for the lady of joy, and the Swede, evidently a woman of 
great patience and tenacity, finds out once more. Fresh migration 
to Manchester, where the mother finally establishes herself and 
even buys 2 houses (she is living on what remains, after her

fritterings, of the former Pindar fortune, made in the TIMBER AND 
BISCUIT TRADE). Here again, however, Pindar sends for his French­
woman—she has undoubtedly visited him three times, as I know 
from the fact that on each occasion he regularly touched me for a 
loan and as regularly paid me back afterwards. But last Saturday 
he brought things to a head by running away with her—as his 
mother maintains, to Australia, but either New York or simply 
Paris would seem more probable to me. He took from the FUNDS 
£190 belonging to him and promptly lost £20 in the omnibus (the 
waiter in the hotel where the Frenchwoman was staying thinks that 
she relieved him of it). The fellow had money enough, his mother 
kept him in everything and he had £100 pocket money. 
Yesterday the Swede followed him to Liverpool. I am curious to 
know what comes of it. 
For the rest of his life the poor devil will be plagued by this 
foolish early marriage to his Swedish ideal— voilà ce qui a toujours 
pesé sur lui." With a little more experience and savoir-faire, he could 
have kept his Frenchwoman very nicely here on his £100, but how 
is a fellow to gain experience if at 21 he falls madly in love with a 
Swede, runs away with her and enters into respectable wedlock! If 
the silly boy had only told me about the affair, it would have been 
easy enough to straighten things out. But to go and let himself in 
for a plus ou moins b enduring, at any rate serious, affair with a 
Frenchwoman à l'étranger, 0 and to run away with her—quelle bêtise! 
Elle lui en fera voir, ma foi, d especially if he has really gone to 
Australia. Besides, his mater is a terribly kind and soft-hearted 
person and God knows what he couldn't have got her to agree to. 
But just as Kinkel sees betrothal, e so Pindar would seem to see 
elopement, as the essence of every love affair. 
Your news about Vetter, etc. and the London people is 
splendid. I am returning Massol's letter f and also Weydemeyer's— 
Cluss'  I shall keep here jusqu'à nouvel ordre? What about the 
articles for Dana? Pindar's absence gives me more time; I am now 
doing Russian more con amore sine ira el studio, h and can already

Dear Engels, 
Your letter today found us in a state of great agitation. 
My wife is ill. Little Jenny is ill. Lenchen" has some sort of 
nervous fever. I could not and cannot call the doctor because I 
have no money to buy medicine. For the past 8-10 days I have 
been feeding the FAMILY solely on bread and potatoes, but whether 
I shall be able to get hold of any today is doubtful. Such a diet is 
not, of course, beneficial in present climatic conditions. I have not 
written any articles for Dana because I didn't have a  PENNY  to go and 
read the papers. By the way, as soon as you send No. XIX, I shall 
write and give you my views on No. XX, i.e. a résumé of the present 
dirty business. 14 
When I was with you 146 and you told me you would be able to 
find me a somewhat larger sum by the end of August, I wrote and 
told my wife that to reassure her. Your letter of 3-4 weeks agob 
hinted that there were no great prospects, but still left some. 
Accordingly I had put off all creditors—who, as you know, are

always paid  by  dribs  and  drabs—until  the  beginning  of Sep­
tember.  Now the  storm  is breaking  out on all  sides. 
I have tried everything,  but in  vain. First  I am  cheated  out of 
£15 by  that  cur  Weydemeyer.  I write  to Streit 3 in Germany 
(because  he had  written  to Dronke  in Switzerland).  The  brute does 
not deign  to answer.  I approach Brockhaus h and  offer  him an 
article  of entirely innocuous contents  for the  Gegenwart.  He sends 
a very polite letter  of refusal. Finally  I spend  the  whole  of last 
week trailing round with  an Englishman 0 who  said he would find 
someone  to discount  the  bills  on Dana  for me.  Pour  le roi de 
Prusse. d 
The best  and  most desirable thing that could happen would  be 
for the  LANDLADY  to throw  me out.  Then  I would  at least  be quit  of 
the sum of £22. But  such complaisance  is hardly  to be  expected  of 
her. On top of  that, debts  are  still outstanding  to the  baker,  the 
milkman,  the tea  chap,  the  GREENGROCER,  the  butcher.  How am I to 
get out of  this infernal mess? Finally,  and  this was  most hateful  of 
all, but  essential  if we  were  not to  kick  the  bucket,  I have, over  the 
last 8-10  days, touched some German types  for a few  shillings  and 
pence. 
You'll have seen from  my  letters that,  as usual, when  I myself 
am in the  shit  and not  just hearing about  it at  second-hand,  I 
plough through  it with complete indifference.  Yet,  que faire}'  My 
house  is a  hospital  and so  worrying  is the  crisis that  it compels  me 
to devote  all my  attention  to it. Que  faire? 
Meanwhile  Mr  Goegg  is again  on a  pleasure trip  to America,

Received, the £4 Sperlinge. 3

Besides, I have today made another attempt, which I trust will 
at long last succeed, to obtain the money on Dana, for I am very

The doctor has just been and prescribed something for the

condition is worst of all. 
You have no idea what a silly ass Pieper is! 
Every day he asks me whether you have sent the thingd back yet 
and what you had to say about his outstanding piece of work. Of 
course I couldn't tell him and now the clown imagines that out of 
envy I am withholding the praises you showered on him. 
Today, when I went out to call the doctor, I ran into the 
humbug. 'Has Engels written and sent the translation?' Not yet, I 
told him, to which Pieper replied: 'But he will, for I myself have 
written to him.' Should you reply you might point out to him that 
there is no call for him to have any say in my transactions with  31011.

[Manchester,] 14 September 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Pieper has written asking me to send him the corrected 
translation a by return of  post.  Cela me convenait bien. h I had a pain in 
the abdomen and was unfit for any kind of work. Tell him that if 
he wants answers to his letters, the least he can do is give his 
address; Pieper, Esq., is not as well known as all that in London, 
even if he has become a clerk at 25/-a week. Apart from that, 
there's no reason why he shouldn't go on with the translation, but 
he must take a little more trouble or, if he can't, at least leave 
blank spaces to be filled in by me, when he strikes a difficult 
patch, which is after all better than writing nonsense out of sheer 
carelessness. His pretext for writing to me, by the way, was simply 
that he didn't know whether I thought him capable of doing the 
thing at all. He shall have a detailed list of his principal mistakes, 
with comments.' 
I might be able to get the thing done tonight and tomorrow 
evening, as I am now feeling better. 
For the rest, his letter faithfully echoed everything he had heard 
at your house and which I, of course, already knew. 
I take it that Pindar has been to see you? He wrote to me from 
London and is on his way to Paris. I shall write to him this 
evening. I have also made the acquaintance of his Swede or Finn; 
c'est une oie, petite bourgeoise au plus haut degré, qui paraît s'être bientôt 
consolée du départ de son époux? He was right to give the creature 
the slip. I shall visit his mater once or twice more for appearances' 
sake and then drop the whole thing; c'est embêtant e to listen to the 
cold-blooded little witch maligning her husband. 
I hope the discounting affair turned out all right and that things 
at home are going a little better. I am now thinking up a new way 
of saving a few pounds; if it succeeds, I shall probably be able to

Physically, my wife is lower than ever before, i.e. sheer debility. 
On doctor's orders she has been taking a spoonful of brandy every

inasmuch as she has at least got up today. She has been in bed for 
a week. Little Laura is convalescent, the others  ALL  RIGHT.  I shall not 
be able to write at length before next week. This week has been 
wasted on abortive business errands and the most nauseous

Dear Marx, 
I didn't know that you were in such a hurry for the translation ' 
and let the thing slide for a bit because, as I said,d  I wasn't well, 
and also because I wanted to tease Pieper a little for having been 
so pressing. However, I immediately set to work yesterday and 
would have finished had not the aging Mr Schily e walked into my

Liverpool for the production of a purported patent soda which 
would yield 400-500 per cent clear profit and might, depending 
on circumstances, produce 4  Va million talers a year. He wanted to 
discuss this fantastic plan with me—and was all ready to fall for 
the swindle with a few thousand talers which his brother says he 
will procure for him. Mr Heise is in it too, but is investing nothing 
but his talents. After the dispassionate advice he has received here, 
the noble Schily will probably keep his hands off the thing and will 
take advantage of a possible opening as Liverpool human cargo 
agent for a fleecer of emigrants in Le Havre. Mr Heise once had a 
natty little plan whereby the funds of the National Loan were to 
be used for this soda swindle; the work was to be carried on 
democratically and the millions thus raked in a devoted to the 
liberation of Europe. It is a pity that nothing came of this scheme, 
which would seem to have foundered largely on the impossibility 
of mustering thirty refugees able to hold their tongues. 
I was, of course, under an obligation to get the noble Schily 
tipsy— il n'y avait pas moyen à y échapper! 1 It's some time since I 
encountered such an innocuous beast. The stupidity and ignor­
ance and thoughtlessness of such a man of principle has to be seen 
to be believed. "When he had become a little tipsy—I was engaged 
in an argument with a third German, Charles" cousin—he 
shouted incessantly, although very good-humouredly: Don't you 
believe that; Engels believes in nothing, there's nothing at all 
Engels believes in, none of the fellows of the JV. Rh. Z. believe in 
anything, no one can fathom them. There's nothing at all Engels 
believes in! I, of course, replied that the fellows of the N. Rh. Z. 
did not find it in the least difficult to fathom the likes of him. This 
morning the worthy fellow, after a sober handshake, set course for 
Liverpool' again, and by tonight the translation will be finished. 
But I get dreadfully held up over the thing since I have to make a 
new translation of all the more difficult bits without exception— 
Pieper makes shift with a literal translation in every case, the result 
being utter nonsense. There are, by the way, some bits which are 
almost impossible to translate. 
However, I will do my utmost to have finished by tonight so that 
you can have it tomorrow.

ENGELS TO MARX 22' 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester, 23 September 1852] 
Dear Marx, 
The day before yesterday I sent you the translation3 and a POST 
OFFICE order for a pound. A few more pounds will follow at the 
beginning of October—i.e. in 9-10 days. I should like to send yo'u 
more at a time because, then even though the total amount is the 
same in the end, it has the advantage of enabling you to plan your 
expenditure more methodically, but my own pecuniary cir­
cumstances are in such a muddle just now that I never know 
exactly how much I shall need for the month, and hence pounds 
only become available singly, so it seems best to send them to you 
straight away. Next month I shall put things on a business-like 
footing, after which I shall soon be able to make some rough 
estimates. 
From the enclosed memorandum you will see that Pieper has 
made a number of fairly bad howlers—I haven't, of course, 
enumerated his transgressions against grammar and Donatus, b cela 
n'aurait jamais fini c You may give it to him if you think it would 
do any good; otherwise, if it might lead him to abandon the 
translation, you had better keep it. Should he grumble over this or 
that correction, you can always use it as an opportunity to point 
out his imperfections. 
Individual bits are, by the way, almost untranslatable.

Incidentally, it might also be advisable for the bookseller to see 
the last chapter in particular; he would then be vastly more 
impressed; I suggest that Pieper might translate it and you send it 
straight on to me; having already looked at it with this in mind, I 
am not wholly unprepared and progress would therefore be rapid. 
Even if it can't be published now, the translation must be 
completed; the chap a will soon become Emperor,222 and that 
would provide another splendid opportunity for adding a 
postscript. 
I am going straight home to finish the article for the Tribuneb so 
that it catches the 2nd post and you can send it off by tomorrow's 
STEAMER. What prospect is there of a new English article for Dana?

Did you see the statistics from Horner, the FACTORY INSPECTOR, on 
the growth of the cotton industry in yesterday's Times and 
day-before-yesterday's Daily News?c 
Oct. 1850-Oct.  1851  — 
2,300 horsepower in newly built factories 
1,400 horsepower in extensions to existing factories 
3,700 horsepower increase in the Manchester district 
and the cotton industry alone.22s The following particulars reveal 
that during that period there were factories still under construc­
tion which would require some 4,000 horsepower and which will 
now have been completed. Since that time, work has undoubtedly 
begun on factories of 3,000-4,000 horsepower, more than half of 
which might be completed by the end of the year; if we assume 
that the increase between Jan. 1848 and Oct. 1850, i.e. 2  SU years, 
is no more than 4,000 horsepower, the steam-power of the 
Lancashire cotton industry will have risen between 1848 and the 
end of 1852 by 3,700+4,000+1,500+4,000=13,200 horsepower.

In 1842 the total steam-power of the cotton industry in 
Lancashire amounted to 30,000 and in 1845 (end) to 40,000 
horsepower; in 1846/47 there was little installed, hence almost 
55,000 horsepower, nearly twice that of 1842, will now be in use. 
On top of that there is hydraulic power—about 10,000 
horsepower (1842) which has barely increased, hydraulic energy 
having been fairly well exploited for some time past. From this it 
may be seen where prosperity's additional capital has gone. For 
that matter the crisis cannot be very far off, although here excess 
over-speculation is almost entirely confined to omnibuses. 
Memorandum on the Translation of the 1st Chapter 
Ad generalia": 
1. Pieper is evidently more used to writing English spontaneous­
ly than to translating. Hence, if he wants for a word, he should 
guard all the more against having recourse to that worst of all 
known aids, the dictionary, which, in 99 cases out of 100, will 
regularly provide him with the most inappropriate word and 
invariably gives rise to a disastrous jumbling of synonyms, 
examples of which follow. 
2. Pieper should study elementary English grammar, in which 
he makes a number of mistakes—especially as regards the use of 
the article. There are also spelling mistakes. 
3. Above all Pieper must guard against falling into the 
Cockney's petty-bourgeois floridity of style, of which there are 
some irritating examples. 
4. Pieper uses too many words of French derivation, which are, 
it is true, sometimes convenient because their vaguer, more 
abstract meaning is often of help in a quandary. But this 
emasculates the choicest turns of speech and often renders them 
completely incomprehensible to an Englishman. In almost every 
case,  where vivid, sensuous images occur in the original, there is a 
no less sensuous, vivid expression of Saxon derivation, which at 
once makes the thing plain to an Englishman. 
5. Where there are difficult bits, it would be better to leave 
blanks to be filled in, rather than—on the plea of literal 
translation — put in things which Pieper himself knows full well to 
be sheer nonsense. 
6. The main criticism of the translation, and which sums up 1-5, 
is gross carelessness. There are passages enough to prove that, if 
a In general 

=====第223页=====
97. Engels  to Marx.  23 September  1852 191 
he really tries, Pieper  is reasonably capable,  but  such superficiality, 
in the  first place, makes more work  for  himself  and  secondly twice 
as much  for me.  Some passages  are  quite admirable,  or could  be 
so, had he  tried  a little harder. 
Ad specialia*: 
schuldenbeladene Lieutnantsh: here  the  word lieutenant  can  only 
mean 'representative'.  In English  and  French  a lieutenant  is not,  as 
in German, primarily  a figure  of fun; 
unmittelbar gegebne, vorhandene  und  überlieferte Umstände'1 : CIR­
CUMSTANCES  IMMEDIATELY  GIVEN AND  DELIVERED.  Pieper himself was very well 
aware that this translation made nonsense,  'DELIVERED'  can  here only 
mean 'delivered  of a  child'; 
sich und die Dinge umzuwälzen  : THE  REVOLUTION OF THEIR OWN  PERSONS. 
This revolution  can be  nothing other than  a somersault; 
A NEW  LANGUAGE  (eine neue Sprache) means  a newly invented 
language. At most, A  LANGUAGE NEW  TO THEM. 
MIDDLE  CLASS  SOCIETY  for bürgerliche Gesellschaft is not strictly 
grammatical  or  logically correct;  it is as if one  were  to translate 
feudale Gesellschaft as NOBILITY SOCIETY.  An educated Englishman 
would not say this. One would have to say  BOURGEOIS SOCIETY  or, 
depending on circumstances,  COMMERCIAL  AND  INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY,  to 
which  one  might append  the  following note:  *By  Bourgeois 
Society,  we  understand that phase  of social development  in which 
the Bourgeoisie,  the  Middle Class,  the  class  of industrial  and 
commercial Capitalists,  is,  socially  and  politically,  the  ruling class; 
which  is now the  case more  or less in all the  civilized countries  of 
Europe  and  America.  By the  expressions: Bourgeois society,  and: 
industrial  and  commercial society,  we  therefore propose  to 
designate  the  same stage  of social development;  the  first expres­
sion referring, however, more  to the  fact of the  middle class being 
the ruling class,  in opposition either  to the  class whose rule  it 
superseded  (the  feudal nobility),  or to  those classes which  it 
succeeds  in keeping under  its  social  and  political dominion  (the 
proletariat  or industrial working class,  the  rural population,  etc., 
etc.)—while  the  designation  of commercial  and  industrial society 
more particularly bears upon  the  mode  of  production  and 
distribution characteristic  of this phase  of social history.* 
To ARRIVE  AT ITS  OWN CONTENTS  (bei ihrem eignen Inhalt anzukommen) 
can only mean: to arrive  AT THE  CONTENTS  OF ITS  OWN STOMACH. 
a In particular  - b debt-ridden lieutenants (this expression  was  omitted  in the 1869 
second German edition  of The  Eighteenth Brumaire  of Louis Bonaparte)  -
c circumstances immediately given, existing  and  handed down

192 97. Engels  to Marx.  23 September  1852 
OLD SOCIETY  (alte Gesellschaft) won't  do in  English  and at  most 
means feudal rather than bourgeois society. Owen's writings have 
been forgotten;  and  whenever  he  mentions  OLD SOCIETY,  it is  always 
accompanied  by a  plan  and  elevation  (if possible  in colour)  of the 
NEW SOCIETY,  SO  THAT THERE  CAN BE NO  MISTAKE; WHICH  IS NOT TO BE  EXPECTED 
NOW-A-DAYS. 
SET IN FIERY DIAMONDS  (in Feuerbrillanten gefassf) is nonsensical in 
English, since  in English usage  it is  diamonds themselves that  are 
set, and  FIERY DIAMONDS  is in any case something of a hyperbole. 
STORM  AND  PRESSURE PERIOD  does not translate Sturm- und Drang-
periode b224 but  Sturm-  und Drückperiode. 
A FUTURE THAT  WAS  TO  COME  (die Zukunft, die ihnen bevorsteht*) is 
nonsense, as Pieper himself knows  (EVERY FUTURE BEING  TO COME),  and 
altogether  in the  style  of Moses  &  Son, d as in an  earlier  bit  where 
'die Geister der Vergangenheit' ,e is rendered as  THE  SPIRITS OF THOSE THAT 
HAVE BEEN. 
THE CIRCLE SHOULD  BE INCREASED  (erweitert werden 1 p. 4, bottom). 8 Un 
cercle  est  élargi,  il  n'est  pas  AGRANDI. h 
THE GENERAL INDEX  (der allgemeine Inhalt der modernen Revolution') 
means  the  general list  of contents  of modern revolution!  Le citoyen 
Pieper  le savait,  du  reste, aussi bien  que moi) 
As IT COULD BUT BE,  wie es  nicht anders sein konnte —lapsus pennae; 
should read  'AS  IT COULD  NOT  BUT BE';  otherwise  it would mean:  wie es 
kaum sein konnte. 
UNWIELDINESS  (p. 5, top in the orig.) is Unbehülflichkeit in the 
passive sense, 'inertia'  in physics  but,  applied  to persons,  can  only 
mean that they cannot move  for fat.  Unbeholfenheit, used  of 
persons,  in the  active sense, means  CLUMSINESS.  This mistake  was 
suggested  to Pieper  by his  dictionary. 
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD  (die Nationalversammlung sollte die Resul­
tate der  Revolution  auf den  bürgerlichen Maßstab reduzieren 1"). C'est 
un peu  fort 1 that,  in order  to evade  the  difficulty  of  translating 
'bürgerlich', Citoyen Pieper should everywhere render  it as  'CONSTITU­
TIONAL'  because 'konstitutionelle Republik'  and  'bürgerliche Republik' 
are used synonymously.  Je demande  un  peu, m what does  CONSTITUTION-

SOCIETY.  C'est  assommant}' 
FOR EVER  AND THE  DURATION  (für die ganze Dauer des Zyklus c). Why not 
rather  FOR EVER AND  A DAY, as the  saying goes? 
UTOPIAN JUGGLES  (utopische Flausen).  JUGGLES  means legerdemain, 
not flights  of fancy. 
TRANSPORTED WITHOUT  JUDGMENT  means déporté contre le sens commun, 
transported  in defiance  of common sense  and  should read without 
TRIAL. 
To PASS  AS A  REAL EVENT  doesn't mean 'um überhaupt als ein Ereignis 
passieren  zu  können', 6 but to  pass  for  something that  has  really 
happened. 
FOUNDED  doesn't mean fonduc  but  fondé.  It has  nothing  to do  with 
the illogical  but  accepted term  CONFOUNDED  for  confondu. 
All these  are  things which Pieper,  if only  he  paid  a little 
attention, would know  as well  as I do but, as  already mentioned,  it 
is easier  to  translate difficult things oneself than  to  correct  a 
translation that  is carelessly thrown together  and  dodges  the 
difficulties.  If he  tried  a little harder,  he could translate quite well.

Weerth has been here since Sunday. On Saturday he leaves for 
Manchester where he will spend 3 or 4 weeks before disappearing 
to the West Indies, etc. 
Enclosed: 
1. A letter in Schurz's handwriting, found in the pocket of a 
waistcoat which Kinkel gave to a refugee of our acquaintance. 
2. Letter from Cluss. 
3. Two excerpts from the revelations about the émigrés, first 
published in the Karlsruher Zeitung and then reprinted by the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung, etc., a in case you haven't seen the 
things  yourself. 
Dr Piali (in Paris) writes inter alia: 
'Kossuth intends to go into action in October. From here, Kiss has been 
giving Kossuth all manner of assurances which probably belong to the realm of 
fable yet could, given the fabulous nature of circumstances here, actually be possible. 
Kossuth is said to have received a note from Bonaparte in his own hand summoning 
him to Paris. A word-for-word copy of this note is believed to be circulating 
throughout the counties of Hungary. Everything in Hungary is in readiness for an 
all-out blow by Kossuth. Even Royal and Imperial officials are involved in the great 
conspiracy...'225 
'Countess Kinski, née Zichy, has been arrested for infanticide. The child was 
fathered by Dr Chaises,' (our well-known shit b), 'a Polish Jew, etc. Madame 
Beckmann (wife of the police spy and newspaper correspondent) will figure as 
dame de compagnie 11 at the hearing before the Assizes.' 
As for the Kossuth affair, it is quite possible that Bonaparte is 
setting snares for him in order to curry favour with Austria. 
Piali has got Hafner to enter into correspondence with 
Ruge-Tausenau, so that now it is just as if we were corresponding 
with Mr Arnold direct. In this way we shall learn at first hand 
about the mystères des grands hommes. d 
The Volksverein, 226 8 man strong, (out of which, according to 
W's e letter to you, Ruge, with well-known virtuosity, formed 3 
committees) is now (Ronge and Dralle included) trailing round the 
City on the pretext of simultaneously founding a 'free community'. 
What the devil has that German-Catholic, Ronge, to do with 'free 
communities'? 227 A few German-Catholic and, in particular, Jewish 
merchants have put their names on the list, if only in the form of 
a 'Die deutsche revolutionäre Propaganda in London und die Revolutionsanleihe', 
Karlsruher Zeitung, Nos. 208-210, 212, 214, 217-220, 224; 3-22 September 1852.

envisaged. 
Willich,  for his  part,  now  makes  a public collection every 
Saturday  at the  Great Windmill Street Society, 24 ostensibly towards 
the cost  of correspondence. 
What  do you say to the  ovations accorded Bonaparte  in the 
provinces?228  The  French  are  indeed making ignominious fools  of 
themselves. 
The Customs Union220 seems  to me to be on the  brink  of 
certain collapse. Austrian bankruptcy shows itself still capable  of 
dealing with Prussian prosperity. 
I see  that Dana  has  accepted  the  article.*  The  Staatszeitung  (New 
York)  has  already published  an  excerpt  in German. 
Old Wellington's death came  at the  right time.  At a  moment  of 
crisis  the old  bull would still have commanded  an  authority grown 
legendary. With him and Peel the  COMMON  SENSE  OF OLD  ENGLAND  has 
been  DULY  buried. 
So our  'people'  are to  appear  on 4  October.16  Bürgers admits 
everything,  at least  so far as he  himself  is concerned.  In  keeping 
with his  profession,  he  will defend himself  'on  principle'. During

will have to be severely chastened by crises if they are to be good 
for anything again soon. Should the next crisis be a mild one, 
Bonaparte will be able to weather it. But it looks as though it is 
going to be damned serious. No crisis is worse than when 
over-speculation develops slowly in the sphere of production, so 
that its results take as many years to mature as they would months 
on the stock and commodity exchanges. And it was not just the 
COMMON SENSE of Old England that was buried along with old 
Wellington, but OLD ENGLAND  herself,  in the person of her sole 
surviving representative. All that remains are SPORTING CHARACTERS 
without a suite, 3 like Derby, and Jewish swindlers like Disraeli— 
who are caricatures of the old Tories in exactly the same way as is 
Monsieur Bonaparte of his uncle.b There'll be a merry dance here 
when the crisis comes, and one can only hope that it will last long 
enough to develop into a chronic condition with acute periods, as 
it did in 1837/42. From what is known of him, by the way, old 
Wellington would have been a truly formidable military leader in 
case of insurrection—the fellow studied diligently, read all the 
military treatises with the utmost zeal and was pretty well-versed in 
his subject. Nor would he have balked at extreme means. 
From what you tell me, the Cologne trial threatens to be terribly 
ennuyant? Unhappy Heinrich,* 1 with his defence 'on principle'! He 
will demand that his 30 sheets be read in court and, if he gets his 
way, will be perdu? The jury will never forgive him for having 
bored them so. The prosecution, by the way, seems to be out of 
luck. For Haupt is off to Brazil, the anonymous journeyman tailor 
has similarly vanished and seems unlike to reappear, and now the 
police official/ because of whose illness the whole affair was 
adjourned in July, must needs go and die on them. But what will 
such good fortune be worth if Heinrich elucidates the thing from 
the philosophical standpoint? 
So the gallant Schurz is carping at Kossuth for preaching the 
gospel of action, after he and Co. have for years eked out a bare 
living from this same gospel! IT IS ALL VERY WELL to try and settle 
Kossuth's hash because he takes the lion's share, but it's really very 
stupid to write things of that sort when the whole world knows 
better. 
That Kossuth will commit some folly seems most probable; what

MARX TO ENGELS 234 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 28 September 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
You have not had a letter from me for some time. The main 
cause of this is Weerth who—not I might say, to my unalloyed 
delight—has plus ou moins* monopolised my evenings which are 
usually given over to writing. As you know, I'm very fond of 
Weerth, mais h it's embarrassing, when one's up to one's neck in 
trouble, to have to face so fine a gentleman, auquel il faut cacher les 
parties trop  honteuses!"  Such a relationship creates twice as much gêne d 
and I hope he will leave for Manchester tomorrow and will on his 
return find me in circumstances that will enable me to consort with 
him franchement.' However, I don't believe that, aside from my wife's 
ill-health, he had any inkling of my predicament. 
I have given him a big parcel to take to you. It contains 
documents that belong in the archives216; some, if not most of 
them are already familiar to you. 
Enclosed the extract from a letter from Barthélémy to Willich. 
Barthélémy gave this letter to a Frenchman by the name of 
a more or less - b but - c from whom the most shameful aspects must be 
concealed - d embarrassment - e frankly

Durand to take to Willich. Durand, unable to read the signature, 
asked Dronke if he would see to it that Willich got the letter. 
Dronke of course agreed, came to my house, and Lupus, who is a 
great artist in this line, opened the letter most expertly. Dronke 
copied out all that was of note—the rest mere twaddle. Que 
penses-tu de ce brave Barthélémy, 'auquel il est impossible de se résigner à 
laisser Bonaparte jouir paisiblement de son triomphe'? Tremble, O 
Byzantium! b As to the alleged letter from Blanqui, this strikes me 
as a piece of melodramatic falsehood on the sinister Barthélemy's 
part. For what news does he give of Blanqui? That the situation of 
the prisonniers de Belle-Ile est bien triste? If that is all Blanqui 
had to divulge to him, he would have done better to keep his libri 
tristium a to himself.  Incidentally, Barthélemy's whole letter shows 
that he is completely out of touch with the French emigration and 
the French societies in France. 
In order that you, too, may 'adopt to some extent the standpoint 
of world history'6  I enclose an article from the Augsburg 
Allgemeine on the spy A. Majer who, here in London, was actually 
'chucked out of the house' by his bosom friends, Willich and 
Schapper. 
I have, I presume, already told you that Herzen is here and is 
sending round memoirs against Herwegh, 235 who has not only 
cuckolded him but has extorted 80,000 fr. from him. 
I have not yet been able to do any work on an article or even on 
the draft of the final instalment of the German article.214 So 
engrossed have I been by the incessant correspondence arising out 
of my domestic troubles that it is 3 weeks since I went to the 
library—which I also forbore from doing in order to sustain my 
wife during what was for her a ghastly time. 
Apropos! 
There is no doubt that the Orleanist conspiracy shows greater 
activity, scope and prospects every day. The gentlemen have 
coalesced with Cavaignac, Charras, Lamoricière, Bedeau. Of 
L. Bonaparte's aides-de-camp 3 have been bought, i.e. substantial 
sums have been deposited on their behalf in the Bank of England. 
The following contract has been entered into with the out-and-out 
a What do you think of the honest Barthélémy 'who finds it impossible to resign 
himself to allow Bonaparte to enjoy his triumph in peace'. - b Words from 
Donizetti's opera Belistxrio, libretto by S. Cammarano, Act II, Scene 3. - c  the 
prisoners on Belle-Ile is very sad. - d tale of woe (an allusion to Ovid's 
Tristia) - e From Jordan's speech in the Frankfurt National Assembly (July 1848) 
(see 'The Frankfurt Assembly Debates the Polish Question', present edition, Vol. 7, 
pp. 360-64).

republicans. Firstly: Formation of a provisional government 
consisting solely of generals. Secondly: By way of guarantee, 
Cavaignac is to receive Marseilles, Lamoricière Lyons, Charras 
Paris,  Bedeau Strasbourg. Thirdly: At the preliminary elections the 
people will be called on by the provisional government to decide 
whether they want the constitution of 1830 and the Orleans 
dynasty, or the constitution of 1848 and a president. In the latter 
case,  Joinville will come forward as a candidate. 
The Jew, Fould, is in constant touch with the Orleans. The 
undertaking has been tentatively fixed for the month of March, 
when Bonaparte will, if necessary, be assassinated by his aides-de­
camp.  But they would prefer Bonaparte to have become emperor 
first and done further damage to  himself. 
I myself have talked to the Orleanist agent3 who travels freely to 
and fro between Paris and London. The day before yesterday he 
and Bangya went to see the Due d'Aumale. 
I see from a letter of Piali's that, at a private audience in 
London, Lord Palmerston told a fugitive Italian noblewomanb  all 
manner of comforting things about Italy, and held out what was to 
him the no less 'comforting' prospect of becoming British prime 
minister within the space of a year. How addicted to lies and 
vanité is old age! Incidentally on one point at least Mr Palmerston 
did not mince his words. In case of insurrection Lombardy and 
Venice must, he said, at once unite with Piedmont. The 
pipe-dreams of an 'Italian republic' must be left to 'the future'. 236 
Dronke, inmate of the  MODEL  LODGING HOUSE, says he is sorry he has 
not written. 'He has his reasons.'

unsuccessful, was made to open my last envelope, which you

Have still not seen or heard anything of Weerth. Why the devil

quite well that you've been down on your luck for years and he 
also knows how things are now, if only from the fact that you're 
still stuck in those old lodgings. 
I have been removed, i.e. my old landlady has removed, and has

days there, as though the Finnish features and Scandinavian-
Germanic heart of his cold-blooded better half were as bewitching 
to me as they were and still are to him. By his evasion? Master 
Pindar had once more gone up a little in my estimation, but these 
letters bring him right down again. He is a Slav through and 
through, sentimental in his frivolity and even in his beastliness, 
servile and arrogant; and he has nothing of the Englishman save 
in exaggerated—being a Russian, he must exaggerate— 
taciturnity. Recently the fellow had grown somewhat more 
garrulous, yet when the long-closed sluice gates finally opened, 
nothing came out but fadaise! 1 On top of that the lovelorn Pindar 
has exceedingly unsavoury appetites and likes nothing better than 
to discuss unnatural discoveries. He's wholly uncultivated and 
withal pedantic, knowing absolutely nothing except a language or 
two; en matière de science^ even the most ordinary mathematics, 
physics and other school subjects, and especially in history of the 
most elementary kind, he is utterly ignorant. Ce n'est que son silence 
acharné qui ait pu faire croire qu'il soit profond." He is ni plus ni

Russian nobility, lazy, dilettante, soft-hearted, would-be blasé and 
at the same time, alas, a born pedagogue. For as long as I could, I 
tried to maintain a good opinion of the fellow, but it can't be 
done. What can one say of an individual who, on reading Balzac's 
fiction for the first time (and the Cabinet des antiques and Père 
Goriot at that) considers it infinitely beneath him and dismisses it 
with the utmost contempt as something commonplace and quite 
unoriginal, yet a week after running away, and apparently in all 
seriousness, writes from London to his deserted wife in the 
following platitudious terms: 'MY DEAREST IDA, APPEARANCES ARE AGAINST 
ME, BUT BELIEVE ME, MY HEART is STILL ENTIRELY YOURS!' There you have the 
fellow in a nutshell. Though the Swede may possess his heart, as is 
proved also by his letters to me, he intends that no one but the 
Frenchwoman shall be presented with his cock. So far as he is 
concerned, the real piquancy of the whole affair lies in this clash, 
this Slavonic, sentimental, vulgar contradiction. The Swede, 
however, has much more sense; she tells anyone who will listen 
that he can do what he likes with his heart provided he keeps his 
carnality at home. Besides, the fellow's lack of ideas and worldly 
wisdom contrast ludicrously with the spiritual pretensions he 
harbours as a Russian. He has understood neither the Manifesto 2 
nor Balzac; of that he has given me ample and frequent  proof.  He 
doesn't know German, no doubt of that, since he fails to 
understand the simplest things. I also greatly doubt whether he 
knows French. Once the mystère with which he held one's interest 
has gone, nothing remains but une existence manquée} Yet in his 
letters the fellow tries to spin out the mystère that has long since 
been unveiled; it's ridiculous. You'll see! Within three months 
gospodin c Pindar will be back again, bon fils, bon époux, bon bourgeois, 
plus taciturne que jamais, 0 and will continue as before to squander 
what remains of his mother's fortune without making the slightest 
attempt to set his hand to anything or study anything. And a 
fellow like that goes and runs away with an experienced 
Parisienne —she'll make him rue the day.

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 
IN WASHINGTON 
London, 5 October 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Cluss, 
Your letter of 16 September3 arrived very late today. I am 
therefore sending only a few lines in reply, since you ask for an 
answer by return. Next Friday a rather more substantial report 
will be going off to you.b  My information about the Brüningk 
woman (she's not a spy but corresponds with her aunt, the 
Princess Lieven, in Paris, who is notoriously one) came from 
Bangya. The latter, however, has very important reasons for not 
being named. If he were, he would forfeit many 'sources of 
information' which, being important to us, must be preserved. 
You can write and tell Schnauffer that he merely has to answer 
that no further authorities need be cited since his (Brüningk's) two 
friends, Kinkel and Willich, have themselves been spreading it about 
in London that Mrs von Brüningk has suspect political connec­
tions. 
That Willich has been saying things of this kind is so well 
known that Schimmelpfennig has taken him to task about it. If 
necessary, witnesses can be cited to support this. 
Kinkel voiced this suspicion outright, e.g. to his friend Kamm, 
a 26 September in the original. - b See next letter.

on his way to America. Kamm helped to spread it further.

until after she had dropped him.)

[London,] 8 October 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Cluss, 
So necessary have your weekly letters become to me that I am 
far from satisfied with your change of method and, out of 
vexation at your silence, have likewise remained silent. 
You'll have had my letter about Briiningk.a  We must— et nous 
sommes dans le vrai h—repay the shameless Gottfried0 in kind. 
According to Imandt's last report of the London guarantors' 
meeting,d  extracts of which appeared in the Wecker, Techow (now 
departed for Australia) rose and said: '...those in particular who 
had enjoyed Brüningk's hospitality should be ashamed of them­
selves for spreading calumnies about Mrs von Brüningk.' Kinkel, 
of the unashamedly unruffled brow, protested his innocence, 
although Imandt could have proved that he was lying. Willich sat 
as though nailed to his seat. 
As regards the second matter, that of remuneration,' I can do 
nothing further since my informant, Biskamp (whom I would beg

you not to name) has settled in France and I have no correspon­
dence with him. However, salary or no salary, this much is certain: 
1. that Kinkel and Willich spent £200 and failed adequately to 
account for it to the London guarantors' congress; 
2. Willich, on the pretext of meeting the cost of correspon­
dence, remunerated himself for as long as he could; 
3. that when Kinkel — proof of his purity in money matters— 
arrived in Paris after his escape 238 he immediately approached one 
of the leaders of the Slav-German etc. revolutionary committee 
there and informed him in confidence that it would be desirable if 
the German democrats in Paris were to give him a welcoming 
supper which he would then get the press to trumpet abroad. (As 
in fact later happened.) To the remark: where is the money coming 
from? Gottfried replied that it could be taken out of the 
revolutionary committee funds. To the further remark that there 
was no money in the exchequer but rather a considerable deficit, 
Gottfried opined that the member (Bangya) to whom he was 
speaking could advance it, he himself being so frightfully popular 
in Germany that money would come flowing in. Subsequently this 
same Kinkel got Bangya to advance him 500 fr. for his personal use 
on the account of the revolutionary committee. His reçu 3 is still in 
existence. He has not repaid it to this very day. 
I have seen the reçu. But Bangya insists on not being named, 
likewise Hafner, who was also present. These people are right. 
The object of Kinkel's policy is by means of bare-faced denials 
(that the man is lying is proved by the business with me b and with 
Dr Wiss, whom he forced to make a public statement by asserting 
that he had no connection with the 'loan in his name'. See 
New-Yorker Deutsche Zeitung and Wiss' own statement therein. 239 
Cite this last fact), his object, I say, is to compel me to show my 
hand and  BY AND  BY to discover whence I draw the information with 
which to catch him out. This, he thinks, would draw my sting. Ça 
ne va pas. c 
You'll be able to follow in the Kölnische Zeitung the proceedings 
against our friends that opened on the 4th of this month in the

Dear Marx,

of the manuscript. It's too maddening. We must at long last insist 
on being told the plain truth. The thing's getting more suspicious 
every day. I don't, and you certainly don't, want our joint work to 
fall into the wrong hands. We wrote it for the benefit of the 
public, and not for the private delectation of the police in Berlin 
or anywhere else, and if Bangya proves intractable, I intend to act 
off my own bat. Our clerk Charles," whom you know, is going to 
the Continent next week, via Hamburg and Berlin. I have asked 
him to inquire carefully into the matter in Berlin and, if the week 
he is spending there should not suffice, to enlist the help of our 
local agent. But I'll wager that we'll see what's at the bottom of this 
stink. What is all this about Eisermann or Eisenmann, the 
bookseller of whom there is no trace whatever in the directory of 
booksellers? But tracking down the 'editor of the former 
Constitutionelle Zeitung' should not prove difficult. If things 
aren't in order, it is absolutely essential that we make a public 
statement,  and that in all the more widely read German papers, so 
that the same trick won't be played on us as was played on Blanqui 
with the piice b Taschereau.243 As for Bangya's mystery-mongering, 
it is, in this instance at least, utterly uncalled-for, and having, for 
my part, had enough of  TERGIVERSATION,  I shall now take what steps 
I think fit. 
Papa Kinkel is coming up here to give German lectures under 
the auspices of third and fourth rate poetical Jews.  Cela sera  beau!"

2. A cutting from Weydemeyer's Lithographierte Correspondenz 
about the effect of this dangerous 'SOCIETY' on their League 
congress at Wheeling. 245 
3. An article for Dana.246 But the whole of it must go off, as I 
have a mass of political stuff for next time. I had a bad headache 
when I was scribbling the thing. So don't be afraid to deal with it 
FREELY in translating. 
You may have read the infamous article in yesterday's Times, a 
contribution dated Berlin.b  All the cur has done is to translate 
from the Neue Preussische Zeitung (the Cologne trial) and add one 
or two scurrilous comments from his own STOCK. 247

Dear Marx, 
It is physically impossible to translate the whole article for you. I 
received it this morning. Have been so busy at the office all day 
that I didn't know whether I was coming or going. This evening 
took tea at 7-8 and just glanced through the thing. Then got down 
to translating. Now—11.30—have done the part I am sending 
you,a up to the natural break in the article. At 12 o'clock it must 
be in the post. So, you see, you will get as much as can possibly be 
done. 
The restb will be translated directly—next week you can send it 
either via Southampton or on Friday.0 In the meantime finish off 
your next article; part of it might be able to go on Friday, if not, 
the following Tuesday, when there is another YANKEE  STEAMER.  So it 
doesn't really matter. But make sure I get the manuscript early; I 
am expecting Weerth any day and will then have to try to make 
best use of my time, since my days are more than fully taken up 
with business.

Dear Marx, 
Herewith the remainder of the recent3 article.b Yesterday I also 
received the next one.249 You can at once dispatch  VIA  LIVERPOOL  PER 
UNITED  STATES  MAIL  STEAMER  the piece I am posting you today; the Pacific 
sails on Wednesday morning. You will be getting some more on 
Friday.c 
You really must stop making your articles so long. Dana cannot 
possibly want more than 1-1V2 columns, it would be too much for 
one number. I shall again have to split this new article, but it's 
difficult to do and I don't yet know where. Five-7 pages in your 
wife's handwriting is quite enough and if you give more in one 
article, Dana won't even thank you for it. 
Bürgers and Röser, and perhaps Otto and Nothjung likewise, 
seem to me pretty well done for. There doesn't appear to be 
anything at all against Daniels, Becker d or Jacobi, and I hope that 
these at least will get off. Becker has extricated himself with great 
effrontery. The more these are exonerated the greater, I think, 
will be the zeal with which the judges and jury will set about the 
compromised men; the injured bourgeoisie and the injured State 
want their victims. 
The edges of the seals on all the letters I am getting from you 
show signs of having been gone over with a hot iron but, so far as 
I can judge, pour le roi de Prusse." The gum on the envelope 
prevents them from getting inside. 
Weerth is here, has brought me the parcel, and sends his 
regards to you all. Szemere's manuscript on Kossuth is far better 
than the one on Görgey —he's a match for Kossuth. I have not yet

27 September 1852, together with your statement. Since I, as one 
of the correspondents of A. Cluss in Washington, am directly 
involved in this matter, I would request you to appoint a 
meeting-place for Thursday or Friday (of this week). b I for my 
part shall bring a witness with me and would therefore request 
you to do likewise, but would point out in advance that the said 
witness may not be either Ruge, Ronge, Kinkel, or Willich, since 
these gentlemen are implicated in the matter now pending, nor can 
it be Mr Schimmelpfennig. When in Paris, that gentleman swore in 
so many words to 'destroy me by slander of every possible 
description'. While I do not believe in his destructive ability, I 
cannot, in view of this assertion, possibly consent to meet him.

today—he is pretty well-versed in a number of subjects, military 
included, and is the most interesting Hungarian I have met so far, 
but he is also a German-Austrian aristocrat. 
So we are now recognised by the State, and even by the police, 
as 'intelligent' people, testeb Stieber. A fine business. The way that 
stupid Stieber tries to shuffle off responsibility for his own spy, 
Cherval, onto our chaps!251 Have you any idea why Kothes and 
Bermbach have been arrested?0  Those two, of all people—it's 
ominous! But we shall discipline Haupt. 252 Weerth will find out 
where he is in South America and, on his arrival there, will 
unmask him. To that end we shall have to get hold of the

can write and tell you nothing I deem it inadvisable for the 
Prussian government to learn at this moment. 
Dana is treating me very badly. I wrote to him about 6 weeks 
ago, telling him exactly how things stood with me and that I must 
be paid by return for the articles I had sent. He has regularly 
published the articles but has not yet sent the money. I, of course, 
must continue punctiliously, notwithstanding. Otherwise it is I who 
will suffer in the end. 
Now, as much as 5 weeks ago, I mollified my LANDLORD with my 
prospects in America. Today the fellow calls and makes a fearful 
scene in front of me and the HOUSEKEEPER. Upon my finally resorting 
to the ultima ratio,3 i.e. abuse, he retired, threatening that if I 
didn't produce any money this week, he would throw me out into 
the street, but first would land me with a BROKER. 
4-5 days ago 130 copies of the Brumaire arrived from Cluss. As 
yet I have been unable to get them from the customs because this 
would mean paying 10/9d. As soon as I've got the stuff out, I'll 
send it to the place you know and at once draw a bill on the same. 
With this and the Dana business I now have over £30 outstanding, 
yet often have to lose an entire day for a shilling. I assure you 
that, when I consider my wife's sufferings and my own impotence, 
I feel like consigning myself to the devil. 
Kothes and Bermbach were arrested because I had sent the 
latter through the former a work necessary to the defence, which 
(despite thin paper and small pearl type) was somewhat bulky.254 
The government thought it had made a splendid catch. But on the 
closer examination jeuneb  Saedt raised heaven and earth to have 
the thing suppressed, for the document contained curious 
STRICTURES on the capability, etc., of jeune Saedt and could, if 
communicated to the juries, only help to acquit the  accusés." 
In the Neue Preussische Zeitung, 'G. Weerth' is said to be a 
member of the Central Authority in Cologne, and, indeed, this is 
cited from the bill of indictment. 
Tell Weerth that I have heard nothing from Duncker.255 
Your 
K. M. 
As soon as the trial is over, and whatever its outcome, we two 
must bring out one or two sheets, 'For the Enlightenment of the

Public'. No such favourable moment to address the nation en large" 
will ever recur. Furthermore, we must not tolerate any semblance 
of RIDICULE which not even the moral dignity and scientific 
profundity of the gentle Heinrich b are capable of dispelling. 
Cherval has himself written to the German Workers' Society in 
London24: saying that he 'is a spy, but in the noble sense of 
"Cooper's spy"'.0 I have conveyed the necessary explanation to 
one of the lawyers'1 by a safe route. 
We should already start casting about with a view to the 
publication on the 'Cologne trial' mooted above. I think it would 
be best if you were to write to Campe asking him to give you the 
name of a reliable agent, should he himself be too afraid. Since 
your credit is good, the agent can be told that he will receive the 
money in, say, 3 months' time (against a bill), if he has not in the 
meantime repaid himself from the sales (as he certainly will do). 
For that matter, the cost of printing this sort of stuff would 
amount at most to 25 talers. 
Vale!e And think the matter over. We cannot remain silent and 
if we don't see to the printing in good time, we shall again miss 
the boat. We should, of course, have to make sure that the agent is 
not downright dishonest, for the thing will even have 'commercial' 
value.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 27 October 1852 
D. M., 
When I wrote yesterday,237 I had only cursorily read Stieber's 
statements and was therefore most agreeably surprised today when 
your document3 gave a turn to the case which now no longer 
makes me despair of the acquittal of all the accused. En effet,b 
Stieber will be utterly discredited. I made a further copy of the 
thing and dispatched it to Cologne by 2 different and very good 
routes258; I also did what should already have been done in 
London, namely affixed the 2 notes in Hirsch's handwriting259 to 
the original with sealing-wax, at the same time recording the fact 
by appending my signature so that, if the worst comes to the 
worst, they cannot be detained unless the whole thing is detained. 
I have now discovered several more ways of communicating with 
Cologne and, although there is a 99% chance that the things will 
reach Schneider safely and on the same day by the first two routes 
(which, however, cannot be used again), it might be advisable for you 
to send me a 3rd copy, authenticated by you, with fresh samples of 
Hirsch's handwriting, which I could then send by yet another route. 
Anyway, the Prussians cannot detain this thing; it would mean 
criminal proceedings against those involved.

114. Engels to Marx. 27 October 1852 219 
Your letter received today had been tampered with, not all 4 
corners of the envelope being properly secured by the seal. 
Whether the one to St.a  had also been tampered with is difficult to 
say, for the firm had opened the outer cover. But it proved so 
easy to open that I am inclined to assume that here too someone 
had already been at it. So the Steinthal address is no longer any 
good either. Write to our old friend, James Belfield, Golden Lion, 
Deansgate, Manchester, with 'F. E.', no more, on the inside 
envelope. In the case of very important and dangerous things, do 
as I am now doing: Make up a parcel of anything with your letter 
inside it, and send it to my house per Pickford & Co.; 
alternatively, per Chaplin, Home & Carver, addressed to me at 
Ermen & Engels, unstamped. That is perfectly safe. But see that 
the addresses, particularly if sent by post, are written by turns in 
different hands and, when parcels are sent by carrier, don't have 
them always taken to the office from the same place by the same 
person. Then the latter way will be perfectly safe. So you must 
either give me a safe address in London to which I can send 
things in this way, or get someone with an unsuspicious landlord 
to assume a false name, à la Williams, or let me know whether 
Lupus is still at 4 Broad Street and Dronke at the Model Lodging 
House, and where any of our other reliable people live so that I 
can use different addresses. 
By employing all these methods alternately we shall achieve 
adequate security. In addition, to make it less conspicuous, you 
should send letters containing matters of no consequence direct by 
post, and I shall do the same. 
Copying out the document has made such demands on my time 
that I really don't know whether I shall be able to keep my word 
in the fullest sense as regards Dana and Friday'sb  STEAMER. At all 
events, something will be forthcoming. You might bear in mind 
that a lengthy spell of more or less uninterrupted chaste living is 
again causing me to burgeon like mad at a certain spot, and at 
times prevents me from sitting down; il faut que cela finisse? 
The statement made by old Justizrat Müller will have put 
Stieber into a blue funk over his original minutes. 260 It also reveals 
how incensed jurists over there must be by the infamies of the 
police which Stieber, in his old-Prussian ignorance of Rhenish law, 
judicial procedure and Rhenish public opinion, is so unashamedly

pamphlet of some 3 sheets.261 The thing cannot be lithographed 
now for two reasons: firstly, such an extensive lithograph would 
prove very expensive while yielding nothing, for one could not in 
all decency sell a lithographed circular of this kind. Secondly, 
nobody could read or be expected to read, a lithograph of 3 
printed sheets.

payment in advance. I would like you to discuss the matter with 
Weerth and Strohn. But not a day is to be lost. If the thing doesn't 
come out now, it will no longer be of any interest. My pamphlet is not 
a vindication of principles, but rather a denunciation of the Prussian

say, I myself am incapable of contributing so much as a centime to 
the thing. Yesterday I pawned a coat dating back to my Liverpool

222 116. Marx to Engels. 28 October 1852 
from me,26 the content of which is briefly as follows: 1. In 1847,264 
when I was in Brussels, Cherval was admitted into the League3 in 
London by Mr Schapper and at the latter's suggestion. Not, 
therefore, in 1848 by me in Cologne. 2. From the late spring of 
1848 to the summer of 1850 Cherval lived continuously in 
London, as his HOUSEKEEPERS can testify. Hence, he did not spend 
this period in Paris as a propagandist. 3. Not until the summer of 
1850 did he go to Paris. The papers found on him and the 
statements he made before the Paris Assizes prove that he was 
Schapper-Willich's agent and our enemy. 
That Cherval was a police spy is borne out by the following: 
1. His miraculous escape (along with Gipperich) from prison in Pa­
ris immediately after sentence. 2. His unmolested stay in London 
although a common criminal. 3. Mr de Rémusat (I have authorised 
Schneider to name him if necessary) tells me that Cherval offered 
him his services as an agent for the Prince of Orleans; thereupon 
he, Rémusat, wrote to Paris and was sent the following documents 
(to be kept for a few hours, so that copies might be made; these 
he showed me), from which it emerges that Cherval was first a 
Prussian police spy and is now a Bonapartist one. The Prussian 
police reject his demand for money on the grounds of 'double 
emploi' b and the fact that he is being paid by the French.265 
Finally, I provided Schneider with a few simple explanations on 
points of theory which will enable him to distinguish between the 
Schapper- Willich documents and our own and to show how they 
differ. 
Besides the letter to Schneider II sent off by you,c  the same 
document went via Frankfurt am Main (where it was posted by old 
Ebner who obtained a regu A) to the lawyer, von Hontheim; this 
was on Tuesday.6 The same package contained: 1. A letter from 
Becker to me, with both London and Cologne postmarks, from 
which it emerges that our correspondence was primarily con­
cerned with the book-trade.266 2. Two enclosures from Daniels to 
me in Becker's letter, which relate solely to his manuscript.267 
3. Two excerpts from Hirsch's minutes.268 4. An excerpt from The 
People's Paper in which by good fortune Cherval actually gives his 
address. 5. Letters from Mr Stieber (in his own hand) to me269  at 
the time of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung; see p. 3 of this letter. 
On Tuesday evening a letter from Schneider arrived with an 
occasional traveller; from this it transpires that his first, sent by

post, was intercepted. However, he received a registered letter 
from here, written to him at my request by Dronke, in which he 
was told that 6-8 weeks ago Hentze was over here at Willich's, that 
Willich was entertained by him and that Willich himself boasted 
that he had given Hentze instructions about how to proceed 
against us. Schneider writes that all the lawyers are convinced that 
the documents are bogus, and he urgently asks for proof of this 
and, in particular, of the fact that Mrs Daniels never wrote to me. 
For want of money nothing could have been done on 
Wednesday, but luckily your £2 arrived. I therefore went to the 
[Great] Marlborough Street POLICE COURT (BEFORE MR  WINGHAM,  MAGIS­
TRATE  OF THE  METROPOLITAN DISTRICT, who asked for an account of the 
affair and furieusement declared himself for us and against the 
Prussian government) where I had two things authenticated: 
1. The handwriting of Rings and Liebknecht; according to 
Schneider II's letter they signed nearly all Hirsch's minutes. As 
you know, Rings is barely able to write and as a taker of minutes 
was therefore a splendid choice on Hirsch's part. 259 
2. I got the landlord of the pub where we hold our meetings to

fellow knows), some 16-18 strong, has been regularly foregathering 
once a week and no more, namely on Wednesdays, and that neither 
he nor his WAITER[S] have ever seen us put pen to paper. The stuff 
about Wednesdays was also testified by a neighbour of his, a German 
baker and householder. 
Both documents, bearing the seal of the  POLICE  COURT,  have been 
written out in duplicate. The first copy of the same I sent via [...] to 
G. Jung who, by a stroke of good fortune, wrote to me 3 days ago 
saying that he was living in Frankfurt am Main, and giving his 
address. Jung will take the things to Cologne himself or send them 
by express delivery. The letter he received is addressed to 
Schneider II and contains, besides the documents mentioned and 
authenticated by the police court: a) A copy of the first letter to 
Schneider270 along with 2 more copies of excerpts from Hirsch's 
minutes, b) Excerpt from a letter from Becker to  myself,  the 
reverse side of which fortunately bears London and Cologne 
postmarks. To quote Becker's own words (the bit I have sent 
contains no more than this): 
'Willich  is sending me the funniest  letters;  I do not reply, but this does not 
prevent  him from describing his latest plans for a revolution. He has appointed me 
to revolutionise the Cologne garrison!!! The other day we laughed till the tears

as I have completed the revolution in Cologne he would have no objection to 
assuming the leadership for all subsequent operations. Very kind of him! Fraternal 
greetings. Your Becker."271 
c) Three letters from Bermbach to me which reveal the nature of 
our correspondence and one of which (that of March) also 
contains an answer to my letter272  about Hirsch, the denunciation 
of Mrs Daniels and the consequent searching of her house." This 
letter proves that she did not correspond with me. d) Copy of the 
letter from Stieber. e) Instructions to Schneider, in which I inform 
him among other things that the authenticated documents (or 
duplicate) will be sent on Thursday (28 October) by registered post 
from London direct to his address, and that he will at the same 
time receive the certificate of registration via Düsseldorf from W., 
the merchant. So if the government detain it this time, we can 
show that we have caught them au flagrant délit h while they, for 
their part, will have deprived the defence of nothing more than a 
duplicate. 
In the Advertiser next Saturday (30 October) you will find a 
short statement on the infamous articles in The Times" and The 
Daily News. It will be signed: 'F. Engels, F. Freiligrath, K. Marx,

This time, I think, the Prussian government will be discredited 
in a manner not even they have ever experienced, and will see for 
themselves that the people they are dealing with are not 
blundering democrats. Through Stieber's intervention they have 
saved our fellows. Even Bermbach's arrest is a stroke of luck. For 
otherwise his letters could not have been sent over there. He 
would have strenuously objected for fear of being placed in 
temporary custody. Now that he's in jug everything's ALL RIGHT. 
Père Barthélémy, born for the galleys, will make the acquain­
tance of Van Diemen's Land 27s this time for a change.274  One of 
this fellow's dirty tricks is his persistent refusal to admit the facts, 
thereby implicating the seconds yet further. However, 2 have 
already stated that they were Cournet's seconds. As the gallows 
loom larger, no doubt the 3rd will forswear his dévouement' and 
likewise admit to having been a second,

Meyen, Oppenheim. Reichenbach, and the rest along with him, 
resolved to return the money to the donors. Reichenbach stated 
that their main reason was as follows: 
'Willich and Kinkel are engaged in downright escroquerie. 3 Thousands of notes 
bearing his (Reichenbach's) signature are still circulating in America and they are 
disposing of them at a discount through their agents, pocketing the proceeds and 
using them for private purposes.' 
Only the winding up of the whole filthy business would provide 
him with the pretext for exposing in public the escroquerie being 
perpetrated in his name, and forestalling any further embezzle­
ment. You can see what those respectable citizens Willich and 
Kinkel have come to. Des escrocs ... voilà le dernier mot! 3

reported to the effect that being a police spy I went to Frankfurt to try to discover 
the murderers of Prince Lichnowski and General Auerswald. I was in fact in 
Frankfurt on the 21st but stayed only one day and as you can see from the 
accompanying certificate I was engaged in purely private business on behalf of a 
lady from here, Frau von Schwezler. I have long since returned to Berlin and 
resumed my work as defence counsel. I would refer you moreover to the official 
correction in this matter that has already appeared in No. 338 of the Frankfurter 
Oberpostamts-Zeitung of December 22 d and in No. 248 of the Berlin National-
Zeitung. I believe that I may expect from your respect for the truth that you will 
print the enclosed correction in your paper without delay and that you will also 
give me the name of your slanderous informant in accordance with your legal 
obligations, for I cannot possibly permit such a libel to go unpunished, otherwise I

while all the cowardly and contemptible fellows (the so-called democrats) had long 
since fled the field. When democratic organs treat me in this fashion it is scarcely 
an encouragement to me to make further efforts.

first by that notorious organ of reaction, the Neue Preussische Zeitung, in order to 
undermine ray activities as defence counsel that gave that paper such offence. The 
other Berlin papers have long since corrected this report. But the democratic 
papers are so inept that they parrot this stupid lie. If I had wished to go to 
Frankfurt as a spy it would certainly not be announced beforehand in every 
newspaper. And how could Prussia send a police official to Frankfurt which has 
enough competent officials of its own? Stupidity has always been the failing of the 
democrats and their opponents' cunning has always brought them to victory. 
'It is likewise a contemptible lie to say that years ago I was a police spy in Silesia. 
At that time I was openly employed as a police officer and as such I did my duty. 
Contemptible lies have been circulated about me. If anyone can prove that I 
insinuated my way into his favour let him come forth and do so. Anyone can make

bureau and handed over the papers to somebody, either Stieber or 
Schulz. The affair came out long before proceedings began in the 
Cologne Court of Assizes. For while under arrest in Hanover, 
Stechan was confronted by the examining magistrate with several 
letters he had written to Dietz in the latter's capacity as secretary 
to the refugee committee presided over by Schapper. 277 As 
everyone knows, Stechan then escaped from prison. Once in 
London, he wrote to Hanover demanding those letters so that he 
could proceed against Reuter in the English courts: 
'1. For forced entry and theft. 
'2. For false evidence. For he maintains that in his letter—which 
has now also been placed before the Cologne jurymen by 
Stieber—the words "530 talers, 500 for the leaders" are an 
interpolation for which the police were responsible. At the time, all 
he had sent to London was 30 talers, nor had he said a word 
about leaders. 
'Needless to say, the Hanoverian court did not accede to 
Stechan's demand. The said Reuter stole all the documents by 
breaking into Dietz's bureau. Dietz and the Schapper clique did 
not find out about the matter until Stechan arrived here.' 
I have this moment received your parcel, my dear Engels. So 
there is no need for you to copy out the above. I shall send it myself 
direct, in one of the envelopes I have received.

doesn't prefer the post of ambassador to Paris that was intended 
for him.278

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 28 October 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Yesterday I sent you a volume of Dureau de la Malle 3 and a 
letter per Carver & Co. b Enclosed herewith you will find various 
covers done up to look like commercial ones, and enclosed therein 
envelopes for Hontheim and Esser I, who are less likely than 
Schneider to arouse the suspicions of the philistines. If you think 
it advisable, you can always enclose a sealed envelope for 
Schneider. However, I don't see why you shouldn't every now and 
again write a line or two to the other defence counsel to make 
them feel that they are important. I also enclose a commercial 
seal; your old one bearing Weydemeyer's arms and the clumsy S 
are useless. When writing to Manchester also use any other old 
SIXPENNY seal. 
Every so often send Schneider a relatively unimportant letter by 
registered post so as to mislead the fellows and make them believe 
that we have dropped our clandestine methods for want of 
addresses. 
There can be no doubt that the citizens whose addresses you will 
find here will see to it that the letters reach their destination. 
You should draw counsel's attention to the obvious CRIMES and 
délits* committed by the police and make sure they enter a plea for 
Stieber's arrest on grounds of perjury and false evidence; the 
fellow has effectively committed PERJURY in the case of your letter to 
Kothes. 279

ENGELS TO MARX

Manchester, 28 October 1852 
By the 2nd post 
Dear Marx, 
Herewith 1 article for Dana—the thing couldn't be broken off 
at any other point.3 If I manage to finish the whole lot this 
evening, I shall take itb  to the post later. In the meantime this will 
do so that you may at least have something on time. For that 
matter, Dana will have to be content with  *U à 4/s of a column for 
a change, especially if he pays so slowly. 
It wouldn't surprise me at all if the Cologne trial were to last 
another month. There does not seem to have been a sitting on 
Monday, maybe because one of the accused or a couple of 
jurymen were unwell, or because everyone needed two consecutive 
days of rest. Especially with all the fine witnesses, none of whom 
can give any evidence. Mr Hentze has really been taken down a 
peg; Weerth met the gallant man in Hamburg, whereupon he 
railed against you most frightfully— cela t'acquitte de toute obligation 
envers lui. c Moreover, he admitted frankly that, if he was angry, it 
was for philistine reasons. 
So write direct—by REGISTERED  LETTER—to  one of the lawyers, 
pointing out that the prosecution has been taken completely out of 
the hands of Mr Saedt and put into those of Stieber, the police spy 
who,  with the Public Prosecutor's tacit consent, is advancing wholly 
novel legal theories, namely: 
1. that it is a crime if, from abroad, someone morally involved 
in the trial provides a lawyer with documents and other 
information for the benefit of the accused, and exposes for what 
they are the lies of the police told by a fellow like Stieber; that it is 
likewise a crime to receive such letters; 
2. that the police, on the other hand, have the right not only to 
permit themselves all manner of crimes, but actually to boast 
openly before the court and the public of: 
a K. Marx, 'Political Parties and Prospects'. - b K. Marx, 'Attempts to Form a New 
Opposition  Party'. - c that relieves you of any obligation towards him

a) Forced entry and theft—the breaking open of Dietz's bureau 
and the purloining of the documents therein. 
b) Incitement  thereto,  avowedly by offers of cash; likewise bribery. 
c) Theft of documents belonging to the defence, inasmuch as part 
of your memorandum to the lawyers was excised and detained; I 
won't even mention their tampering with letters, because after­
wards the fellows did at least try to give it a semblance of legality. 
d) False testimony and perjury, inasmuch as Mr Stieber deliberate­
ly represented the Cologne people as being the accomplices and 
associates of Cherval, etc., as he himself knew better and 
subsequently admitted it; notably inasmuch as he stated on oath 
that a letter sent through the post had not reached Cologne until 
19 October, when in fact it was already there on the 15th; 
inasmuch as he cooked up all those lies about the special courier, 
etc. 
e) Forgery, inasmuch as the alleged minutes were fabricated by 
the police themselves and submitted as genuine, whereas we were 
deprived of all means of providing the defence with counter-
evidence. 
And so on. 
If the lawyers conduct themselves boldly and adroitly, the case 
might end, not in a verdict against the Cologne people, but in the 
arrest of Mr Stieber for perjury and various other Prussian crimes 
against the godless French Code pénal. 164 
There was something else I wanted to write to you about but I 
forgot it completely when I started chatting with Weerth, who has 
just got home. 
I have just heard from him that Mrs Daniels has also been 
called as a witness for the defence— tant mieux! 1 The minutes will 
come to a glorious end. And ce pauvre b Bermbach would appear to 
have been unceremoniously bundled into the dock with the rest. 
What can they want of this poor, innocent devil?

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester, 31 October 1852] 
Dear Marx, 
The way the case has been opened, it can hardly go wrong. The 
letter from Stieber" is a discovery that's worth more than all the 
gold-mines in Australia. What luck that the malheureuxh  Nothjung 
kept these old N. Rh. Z. papers and sent them to London at the 
time!  I only hope the thing arrives; for not even the Chief Public 
Prosecutor would consider it a crime to suppress stuff of that 
kind. You'd have done better not to send this letter by registered 
mail but in some other way. There's still a possibility that 
something may go wrong between Frankfurt and Cologne and, 
even though the copy provides a fair amount of  proof,  the 
original is still all-important. Somebody should have taken it to 
Cologne, or else it should have gone by express delivery. However, 
I hope all will be well. 
The other documents are likewise admirable, and we shall now 
raise a really tremendous hullabaloo. 
Yesterday, for safety's sake, I sent a letter to v. Hontheim,280 for 
posting in Amsterdam, in which I gave him a summary of what 
you had written in the letter intended for Schneider,0 and told 
him about the non-arrival of Schneider's letter addressed to 
Dronke. 4 copies, then, and one summary. 
Today I shall send another copy of Stieber's letter to Cologne by 
a different route, likewise dispatch to the Rhine Province cuttings 
containing the article in Friday's Advertiser,0 and the statement in 
Saturday's,6 and shall in general throw at the bourgeoisie items of 
information about the crimes of the police. 
Now for some suggestions: 
1. In view of the highly equivocal—and, as it now behoves us to 
show, in passages unequivocal-—nature of the only incriminating 
pieces of evidence, your evidence and that of Lupus, Pieper, etc., 
etc., if given on oath and authenticated, is of great importance. It

does not matter what the Public Prosecutor says, the jury regards 
ourselves and the accused as GENTLEMEN. Now nothing could be 
easier than for 2 or 3 of you to go to Wingham and there record 
on oath those matters relating to London which all of you know 
about. For example: 
a) that to the best of your knowledge there is no such person as 
H. Liebknecht, but only a W. Liebknecht, and that you people 
have never known any H. L.; 
b) that you yourself never received a letter from Mrs Daniels; 
c) that, aside from the Wednesday meetings, you did not hold 
any other meetings—on Thursdays in any other pub,—and 
d) that you declare the evidence, contained in Hirsch's minutes 
as to speeches, lectures, etc., etc., allegedly given by yourselves, to 
be UTTERLY UNTRUE; 
e) that the scrap of paper found with the red catechism and 
regarded by the Public Prosecutor as being in your handwriting, 
did not emanate from you281 — 
and anything else in the latest proceedings and Stieber's first 
statements which seems untrue and worth refuting. 
When all this has been recorded on oath before Wingham, he 
will draw up an ordinary affidavit—you might as well take a draft 
in English along with you—and you should ask him to hand it to 
a POLICEMAN, who will accompany you to Hebeler, the Prussian 
consul in the City; the latter must certify Wingham's signature, 
otherwise he will forfeit his exequatur. 2 copies of this, drawn up as 
above, can then be dispatched to Cologne and cannot fail to have 
an effect. I regard this as extremely important, for it means that 
all the legal formalities have been complied with and that the 
thing is a legal document. Should Hebeler nonetheless refuse to 
sign, go to any NOTARY PUBLIC, who will certify it282 (the latter 
procedure was indicated to my old man in a similar case by the 
Prussian authorities). 
2. Yesterday I received a lengthy dissertation from Dronke 
about Bangya.283 I must confess that, in view of those wretched lies 
about our manuscript,3 in view of Duncker's letter sent you on 
Tuesday by Weerth, 84 and assuming that it is true he addressed 
the last letter but one to Kothes, I find no reason to doubt that he 
is a Prussian spy. The fact that he keeps in with the Hungarians is 
no proof of the contrary; if he refers us to the Hungarians, he will 
likewise refer the Hungarians to us. This matter must be 
a K. Marx and F. Engels, The Great Men of the Exile. 

=====第265页=====
119. Engels to Marx. 31 October 1852 233 
investigated without fail and as expeditiously as possible. And if, 
within vingt-quatre  heures,*  Mr Bangya fails to provide satisfactory 
information as to the whereabouts of the manuscript, the previous 
address of the alleged Eisermann, giving street and no., and about 
his highly questionable means of subsistence, I would strongly 
recommend that counsel in Cologne ask Stieber outright what he 
knows about a certain Colonel Bangya. After the revelations that 
have already been made, Mr Stieber will no longer dare to give 
false evidence, since he cannot know what will be coming next; at 
the same time Schneider should be informed about the business of 
the manuscript so that he can pass the story on to the court, after 
which no further statement need be made for the time being. 
3. A few people from Stechan's workers' society,25  committee 
members, etc., might also go to the magistrate, not with little scraps 
of paper, but with whole pages, or as large samples as possible, of 
Hirsch's handwriting, and declare on oath that these are in Hirsch's 
hand. Cela vaut infiniment mieux h than mere unauthenticated 
cuttings. 
On Monday we shall see that some more money is sent to you, 
so that none of you will get into difficulties. Your own affidavit 
could be dispatched last of all—which would have certain 
advantages; but we must ensure that everything arrives before the 
cross-examination of the witnesses is over. 
Don't forget to let me have a few safe addresses as soon as you 
can. 
Stechan's statement about the forgeryc  must also be sworn 
before a magistrate. Cela pourra avoir de brillants résultats. 6 
Kinkel has today been sneaking round the Exchange here, in 
tow of a RABBLE of local German Jews. However, we have been 
putting a few ideas in our people's heads and, here as in 
Bradford, Weerth will make things pretty hot for him. 
Could you not obtain direct evidence of Kinkel's escroquerie' 
from Reichenbach through Imandt or someone, and send copies 
of it to the Examiner and Times, the Guardian, or the Courier here, 
and also to the Bradford papers? Such direct evidence, of course, 
that the fellows need have no fear of a LIBEL action. You might also 
send it to Dr J. W. Hudson, secretary of the Manchester 
Athenaeum. 244 
Strohn is back in Bradford, somewhat indisposed, and will be 
coming here on Wednesday or Thursday. I am writing to him

today and will provide him with adequate instructions so that, 
when you send him things, you can count on his attending to 
them efficiently and in such a way as not to clash with »131 
arrangements. The main thing is that none of the commercial 
addresses should be used more than once. 
We must take things to such lengths that in future people will 
no longer talk about 'stealing' but 'stiebering'.* 
Then, too, there is the lawyer Schürmann, one of the defence 
counsel, whose address can be used for enclosures. Schneider is 
really too risky. 
There's another reason why the Bangya affair is important: 
Granted that the original minute-book was not in Hirsch's hand, 
but copied—what then? Stieber has sworn in any case that he 
doesn't know Hirsch. 
Should the Cologne people be sentenced after all, which I 
regard as exceedingly unlikely if we go on doing everything in our 
power to send over all available information and documents, we 
must write something without fail. If they are acquitted, I believe 
that this would merely soften down the government's defeat. 
Meanwhile we can only wait and see. Above all an exact copy must 
be taken of every document, affidavit, etc., all of them fully 
authenticated, etc., etc., for these things will provide a splendid 
series of pièces justificatives. 
Dronke has asked me for 10/- as he is ill and down on his luck. 
Let him have it, or perhaps a bit more, when the next lot of 
money arrives, i.e. on Tuesday. 
You had best send me the addresses per Pickford or Carver.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 2 November 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
Received your letter together with £5. 10/- given to Dronke. 
The time when we had to be coy about writing openly to each 
other's actual addresses is now past. On Saturday (30 October) the 
lawyers received the bulk of the documents, on Sunday, the 
second letter from Frankfurt, and yesterday my last letter with the 
DECLARATION before the magistrate." Today I have sent by registered 
post direct to Schneider II the declarationb which appeared in 
today's Morning Advertiser, not so much because there was still any 
necessity to do so, as to show the Prussian government that we 
possess the means to insist on the integrity of its mails or, failing 
that, to expose it before the London public. 
The lawyers received all they needed in good time, i.e. before the 
prosecution closed its case. At present I am of the opinion that, 
unless some incident should prolong the trial and thus necessitate 
renewed intervention on our part, nothing more should go off to 
Cologne. 
Herewith a letter from Imandt to Cluss, which contains more 
details about Kinkel's and Willich's  escroquerie. 0 Up till now I hadn't 
had time to read the letter and had done no more than have it 
copied out for you by Pieper. It went off to Washington last 
Friday. 0 
Fleury, a merchant in the CITY, says that he can bear witness that 
he and other businessmen have been invited by Kinkel and Willich 
to purchase Loan Notes. 
Just now that chevalier d'industrie," Willich, is living on the bounty 
of the Russian, Herzen. 
From what Freiligrath told me yesterday, it would appear that, 
before his departure for Manchester, Kinkel had been grovelling 
with renewed zeal before a crowd of CITY ALDERMEN, merchants, 
etc., in his role of fund-raiser, rhetorician and lesson-giver.

As for the scrap of paper wrongly attributed to me, all I still 
need is the address of Moses Hess, who is living in Liège. For I am 
going to write to him and say: 'Tell me who it was you gave the 
Catechism to and who hawked it round Germany. Otherwise I shall 
denounce you as a FORGER in the Indépendance.' Moses is bound to 
spill the beans, if it transpires that on this occasion it was not the 
police but Kinkel-Willich who imitated my handwriting, I shall 
have them up in court here for imitating another's hand. 
Don't forget to send me the last bit for Dana.a Parliament

The merchant, Fleury, further testifies that, almost every week, 
Willich extorts pounds from him and his English friends on the 
plea that he needs this for the refugees. Now, it can be proved 
that Willich-Kinkel rudely turn away all refugees with the remark 
that they have not a centime to spare for such purposes. Willich 
tells them that he hasn't enough himself for his daily bread; 
Kinkel points with emotion to his children, and at most gives away 
a waistcoat cast off by the late Julius, the absent Schurz or his own 
august person.

So the documents, including the original of Stieber's letter, 3 
arrived safely. Things will liven up once the gallant Public 
Prosecutor has done. One might strain one's faculties to the 
utmost, yet never succeed in producing inanities such as those 
uttered by Seckendorf. Because Engels has stated in print that the 
best communists made the most courageous soldiers, b it follows 
that Bürgers must be convicted of conspiracy. What the cross-
examination evidently implies is that the accused harboured the 
intent—suspect de suspicion d'incivisme c—hence that it is a matter of 
perfect indifference whether or not the accused belongs to the 
Leagued —in other words, Mr Seckendorf, despairing of a verdict 
against Daniels and Co., positively invites the jury to acquit 
Bürgers and Röser too! To have become so utterly addle-pated, 
the fellow must have been swilling strong BRANDY AND WATER every 
evening for at least a week. Nowhere in all this mummery is there 
a single word TO THE PURPOSE. Incidentally, ever since the presiding 
judge e released particulars of the cross-examination, I have not 
for a moment doubted Bürgers' and the others' acquittal. Neither 
his plaintive manifesto' nor his circular tour could possibly be 
transmogrified into an 'enterprise' whereby the constitution, etc. 289 
Or are the annals of history to read thus: 'In May 1851, at the 
time the Crystal Palace290  was opened in London, the tailor 
Nothjung travelled from Berlin to Leipzig in order to overthrow 
the Prussian constitution and start a civil war.' In any case, the 
minute book has been set aside and, from Strohn's account, some 
of the jurymen are quite decent, namely v. Rath, v. Bianca, Leven, 
Leiden, Herstadt and one other. 
I also believe that, in view of the way the case is turning out, we 
ought at all costs to publish something. But it would be advisable, 
if not essential, for Schneider and one of the accused to come over 
to London after the trial, in which case I should arrange to come 
up there for a Saturday and Sunday. Then, when all has been 
discussed, you could go back with me and the manuscript could be 
ready within a few days. Meanwhile, write to old Ebner, asking

him whether he couldn't place this little pamphlet with Löwen­
thal—so far as I am concerned, we could go halves with him, both as 
regards profits and losses. 
As for Bangya, the most immediate case against him necessarily 
falls to the ground if it is established that he did not address the 
last letter but one to Kothes.a  I was completely flabbergasted when 
Dronke said in his letter that it was Bangya who had addressed the 
last letter but one, i.e. the last letter to have arrived safely. How did 
the fiévreuse h little man come to invent such a story? But the 
Collmann business looks fishy too. 288 This letter of Collmann's is 
written in exactly the same hand as the earlier ones from 
Eisermann c; I shall send it back to you tomorrow, but it seems to 
me that we ought to hold on to it. Il y a là un faux? Before long we 
shall know through Weerth what is the matter with Collmann e; in 
the meantime you should ask Bangya to explain how Mr Collmann 
comes to be writing under a false name, etc., and why 'the man', 
and what man, died, and how it is that he has now suddenly come 
to life again. And find out from Mr Bangya the name of 'the 
commission agent' in London whom he 'knows' according to one 
of the letters. And, so that Dronke may also have something to do, 
get him to make inquiries with a German bookseller about 
Collmann. 
It is most odd that all the letters should arrive by carrier; there's 
never a postmark on them, and their tone is always so perfunctory 
and nonchalant that one can't help smelling a rat. This one again 
has been written from 'a friend's at an inn'. None of this seems at 
all BUSINESSLIKE,  any more than does the absurd evasion that it is his 
business when the manuscript' should be published. Enough. 
Even if in this instance Bangya is acting as honourably as can be 
expected of a mendacious Slav, it nevertheless seems to me that 
his friend in Berlin is an archscoundrel. Now, however, everything 
should be cleared up since Mr C. figures here as the immediate 
owner of the manuscript, and also as publisher. If there is no 
bookseller of this name, that clinches the matter. 
Anyway, the notion that a publisher can leave a manuscript 
lying in his drawer for years is a novel one and hardly smacks of 
the book-trade. To my mind, that story about the children's books 
is also a  DODGE;  in England such muck never comes out at Christmas 
time.  Moreover, it is written in such a vague and disjointed way

that Bangya could not possibly infer a firm order from it. Nor 
does one write at an inn on such rotten paper, which looks more 
likely to come from a Prussian government office. Enfin, nous 
verrons? 
However, J myself can't possibly write to Bangya at this point, 
since I have no details of what happened between you and him, 
what he said to you, what other letters he may have shown you, 
etc. But we've got him now. 
Saturday, 6 November 
For physical reasons I did not manage to send off the foregoing 
yesterday. Since then I have read another 'Stieberiad' in the 
Kölnische Zeitung. b So the original minute-book has been dropped 
and in its stead H. Liebknecht has risen from the dead in the 
shape of a cash receipt. Monsieur Hirsch and company—for there 
must be a number of them—seem to have well and truly done the 
stupid Prussian police out of a lot of money. // valait bien la peine, c 
their sending a police lieutenantd to London merely to find 
themselves imposed upon in this manner and, on top of that, 
fobbed off with the information about the most secret meeting at 
your house.291 
But what is all this about Dronke's friend, Fleury, whom we 
here find openly and unequivocally described as a police spy? This 
will deflect some of the little man's wrath from Bangya. It would 
also seem that someone has blabbed about Stieber's letter, not that 
it matters; the way Stieber himself is drawing attention to this 
document and speaking of 'infamous calumnies' can only serve to 
enhance its effect. 
Weerth is in Liverpool and will not be back for several hours so 
that I shall have to hold on to the letters from Schneider and 
Bangyae until tomorrow.

Don't forget to send me by return copies of Freiligrath's poems

ask him to read them aloud. 
Hirsch must still be here, at least, he was positivement 6 here last 
week, for I saw him at the Athenaeum. 244 Another chap who is the 
spit image of him was here as well and this confused me at first. 
Perhaps he has a post here, or is looking for one? By the way, 
when you were last here292  we met a fellow once in Broughton 
who cried 'Good morning, Marx', and we couldn't place him. It 
was Hirsch! So the fellow goes 'on tour'. As soon as the trial is

As far as Bangya is concerned, just hold on to Collmann's 
letter. Whenever he inquires after it, I shall say I kept forgetting 
to ask you to send it back. Had there been intentional deception 
on Bangya's part he would have supplied the incriminating 
evidence  himself.  So much is clear. Originally Bangya was accused 
of having betrayed the Paris conspiracyl4S and later of double-
dealing in the Cologne affair. In both instances the contrary has 
proved to be the case. According to Schneider's letter, Kothes' 
address" would appear to have been betrayed by one of Kothes' 
own acquaintances. ** Finally, as regards our pamphlet,b Weerth 
will by now have made inquiries about Collmann's address and the 
thing will inevitably be cleared up. I have given Bangya a letter to 
Collmann in which I point out that, though his publication date 
for the pamphlet is contractually agreed, there is no contractual 
agreement forbidding us to publish the original manuscript—still 
in our possession—in Brussels or New York, should we so desire. 
Nor is there any contractual agreement forbidding publication in a 
fortnight of the 2nd part by another bookseller under a separate 
title if it is ready and of itself constitutes a complete whole, etc.295 
Now for the Cologne affair. 
Had I been in Bürgers' etc. place, I should never have allowed 
Mr Becker 0 to flaunt himself so brazenly and at the expense of 
everyone else as l'homme supérieur? or to debase as he did the 
character of the whole proceedings, much to the delight of the 
democrats. To defend oneself is one thing but quite another to 
deliver an apologia for oneself at others' expense. Becker is one of 
the revolution's epigones, possessed of a great deal of cunning but 
little intelligence and well able to calculate just how he can trick 
his way up to become a great man. His talents remain those d'un 
infiniment petit." 
As you already know, the government has, out of sheer 
desperation, resorted to heroic means, namely Goldheim's retro­
spective report,291 only to find itself once again ensnared. 
Goldheim's testimony furnished 2 data: 'Greif and 'Fleury'. 
I therefore instituted inquiries about Greif (to which end I myself 
engaged a Prussian informer). In this way I obtained his address and 
found out that he lived at 17 Victoria Road, Kensington. This, 
however, is Mr Fleury's house. Hence it was established that Greif 
lives with Fleury. It further transpired that Greifs official position 
here is not that of 'police lieutenant' but of attaché to the Prussian

Embassy. Finally, that ü'n Saturday, 6 November, he left here for 
a few weeks. Probably to go to Cologne. By his own account, he 
left because he was afraid of the Marxians, because Fleury 
had swindled him, etc. 
So much was now clear: Greif was Fleury's superior and Fleury 
Hirsch's superior. And so, indeed, it has turned out. 
On the other hand, Imandt and Dronke called on Fleury on 
Friday, 5 November, Kölnische Zeitung in hand. He, of course, 
feigned surprise, said he knew no one by the name of  Greif, 
expressed his readiness to make any statement in the presence of a 
magistrate, but first wanted to consult his lawyer, made two 
appointments for Saturday, 6 November, one for 2 and the other 
for 4 o'clock, but took good care not to turn up and so gained for 
the police one more day on which we were unable to operate, 
apart from sending a few preliminary letters to Cologne. Finally, 
on Sunday, 7 November, Dronke and Imandt extracted from him 
a statement which you will see in the Kölnische? 96 I shall send you 
a copy but cannot at this moment lay hands on it. Having his 
statement safely in their pockets, they told him he was a spy, that 
Greif was living at his place, that we had known all about it and 
had been hoodwinking the police, whereas they had believed they 
were hoodwinking us. He, of course, continued to protest his 
innocence. 
Finally I sent round some fellows (among them the tipsy 
General Herweg) to track down Hirsch's lodgings. It transpired 
that he also lived in Kensington, not far from Fleury. 
One more thing before I go on. The whole of Goldheim's testimony 
becomes perfectly explicable if you consider that, 1. Goldheim was 
here on 30 October (Saturday) and, in company with Alberts, 
secretary at the Prussian Embassy, went to see Greif and Fleury; 2. 
that on the morning of that same 30 October our statement about the 
forthcoming revelations 3 appeared in 5 English papers; 3. that 
Fleury had arranged a rendez-vous with Imandt and Dronke for 
that same 30 October because Dronke was to take over French 
lesson for him instead of Imandt. 4. But that before Stieber made 
the revelations about London at his 2nd interrogation and 
immediately after his first interrogation on the subject of Cherval, 
etc., I had sent to the Kölnische Zeitung, the Frankfurter Journal and 
the National-Zeitung, a statement in which Stieber was already 
threatened with the disclosure of his letter to me. b Admittedly this 
a K. Marx and F. Engels, 'Public Statement to the Editors of the English 
Press'.  - b See this volume, pp. 225-26. 

=====第276页=====
244 123. Marx to Engels. 10 November 1852 
statement did not appear in any of the papers. But both post 
office and police had incontestably taken note of it.297 
This provides a highly prosaic explanation for Stieber's 'clair­
voyance' and the omniscience of his police agents in London. 
Everything else Goldheim said was Jabulae.* I have conveyed such 
information as is necessary about these things to Cologne by 
diverse channels, together with Fleury's statement. b 
But the best is yet to come. 
It was, of course, my intention to take out a WARRANT against 
Hirsch, for which purpose I made inquiries about his lodgings. 
But it was not till Saturday that I obtained the address. I felt sure 
that, if I could get the WARRANT against Hirsch, he would implicate 
Fleury, and Fleury  Greif. 
What happens? On Friday Willich, very secretively, betakes 
himself with Hirsch to the court in Bow Street where, in 
Schärttner's presence, he obtains from Hirsch what is purported to 
be a written confession in triplicate stating that some six months ago 
he and Fleury fabricated the spurious minutes, he then sends off the 
3 documents, 1. to Göbel, the presiding judge at the Assizes, 2. to 
Schneider, 3. to the Kölnische Zeitung —and gives Hirsch the 
money to escape, indeed, even has him accompanied to the 
steamer, ostensibly so that he can confess in person in Cologne. 
We all only heard of this through the inquiry we had set on foot 
about Hirsch, and partly, too, at Bow Street, where we went to 
take out the  WARRANT.  Schapper himself told Liebknecht that Willich 
had breathed not a word to him of all this. Thus, our intention of 
initiating proceedings of our own in London was thwarted by Mr 
Willich's sleight of hand. To what end? The answer is very simple 
if we reflect that for the past year he has been the merchant 
Fleury's homme entretenu 0 and that in any  case,  therefore, some highly 
compromising things must have emerged had we had Fleury apprehended. 
An instance, by the by, of the high esteem in which this man 
Fleury (I have never set eyes on him) is held by the democrats— 
Techow, leaving for Australia and already on board ship, wrote him a 
letter in which he commended him for having both heart and head in the 
right place. 
The money Hirsch was given for his journey by Willich had 
undoubtedly been handed to the latter for this purpose by Fleury. 
Hirsch has admitted that he tried to copy Liebknecht's writing 
and that he was working under the direction of the merchant 
Fleury (this cur is, besides, a man of  substance  and has married into 
a fabrication - b See this volume, p. 235. - c kept man

a very respectable English Quaker family), just as Fleury himself 
was under the direction of  Greif.  This confirms in every particular 
what I deduced straight away from the content and dates of the 
original minute-book published in the Kölnische Zeitung, and which 
none of the lawyers has hitherto duly exploited. 298 
To my mind there is no doubt that the Cologne accused will all, 
without exception, be acquitted. 
I should be grateful if you could write and tell Strohn that he 
would greatly oblige me if he could send me a few pounds 
forthwith. Of the £4.10/- received through you, nearly £3 has 
been spent on errands, informers, etc. Our impoverished League 
friends naturally took advantage of the many errands, appoint­
ments, etc., to tot up pretty substantial faux frais de production 3 
for beer, cigars, omnibuses, etc., which I, of course, had to make 
good. 
You will be receiving Freiligrath's poems.b

Dear Engels, 
Last Wednesday, a at my suggestion, the League hereb  disbanded; 
similarly the continued existence of the League on the Continent

of Bürgers-Röser, it had to all intents and purposes already ceased to

detailed account of the dirty tricks played by the police,' and also 
an appeal to America for money for the prisoners and their 
families. Treasurer Freiligrath. Signed by all our people.304 
The article for the Tribune? however, is dependent on the time

ENGELS TO MARIE BLANK 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 22 November 1852 
Dear Marie, 
I really must beg your pardon most humbly for not having 
already long since replied to your first letter. But at the office 
where I was formerly in the habit of dealing with my private 
correspondence, I now have so much to do that there can no 
longer be any question of that, and at home, mon Dieu," my 
writing materials are always in such poor shape (as, e.g., my 
calligraphic experiments at the beginning of this letter go to show) 
that I can hardly bring myself to grapple with them. Nevertheless, 
I am doing so this evening in the hope that you will marvel at my 
sense of duty and regard my bad handwriting as yet another 
token of my brotherly love. 
There was, besides, another reason that prevented me from 
writing to you. Namely the fact that, when you were in Germany, 
it occurred to me that there was something I wanted to ask you 
about; but when you came back I couldn't for the life of me 
remember what it was. You will understand that such lack of 
character, or rather such lack of memory, was bound to arouse 
considerable qualms of conscience in a self-respecting man. In all 
sincerity I must confess that I could not bring myself to write to 
you so long as I had not got to the bottom of this weighty matter. 
But your second letter, and the increased mental activity induced 
by a  WELSH  RABBIT and a few glasses of  SHERRY,  have at last brought me 
up to the mark again and I now recall what it was I wished to ask 
you. The matter in question is as follows: Did I, at Christmas or at 
Easter, leave two cotton shirts at your house? For these have long 
been missing from my wardrobe and if you have found them I 
should be quite glad, inasmuch as this would demonstrate that I 
am not at all a slipshod person. 
You ask me what my wishes are. Ma chère soeur, b it's some time 
since I indulged in wishes, for nothing comes of them. Besides 
which, I really have no talent for it, for if by chance I catch myself 
being weak enough to wish for anything, it always turns out to be 
a My God - b My dear sister 

=====第281页=====
126. Engels to Marie Blank. 22 November 1852 249 
something I can't have and it would therefore be better for me to 
get out of the habit of wishing altogether. As you see, even on this 
subject I cannot help relapsing into the moral tone of Ecclesiastes, 
so THE  LESS  WE SAY  ABOUT  IT, THE  BETTER  IT WILL  BE. If, therefore, you intend 
to put me under an obligation by providing yet another token of 
your love this Christmas, my bungling and untutored talent in the 
matter of wishing is unlikely to be of much assistance to you, 
though I console myself with the thought that you do not in fact 
require such assistance, à en juger par le passé? 
I am glad to hear that you are all flourishing. Apart from a 
couple of colds I, too, have been pretty well on the whole; in 
particular there was no recurrence of toothache with the change 
of season and I hope it's now a thing of the past. I am still living 
in Strangeways, though a few doors further away,b but am 
considering leaving this district next month and moving a bit 
closer to Little Germany305 ; it really is too lonesome here and this 
winter I shall, for a change, allow myself a little entertainment, in 
so far as such a thing is possible in this smoky place. For six 
months past I have not had a single opportunity to make use of 
my acknowledged gift for mixing a lobster salad—quelle horreur"; 
it makes one get quite rusty. Anyhow, I shall have to write another 
book next spring, probably in English, about the Hungarian war 136 
or the novels of Mr Balzac, lately deceased, or about something 
else.  This, however, is a great secret, otherwise I wouldn't breathe 
a word to you about it. 
What is Elise d up to? If she's a good cook, and can darn 
stockings, she might well come over here after Christmas and keep 
house for me. Now that Gottfried' (or is it Franz f?) the 
lute-player has set up house on his own, I am virtually under an 
obligation to follow suit to outshine him, which is very easy, for 
Elise would undoubtedly be able to do the honours of the house 
quite famously, while all your old stick-in-the-mud bachelor has is 
an ancient, crotchety, six-foot-tall, skin-and-bone, intimidating, 
snarling, blear-eyed, doddery, unkempt, ex-kitchen maid of a 
housekeeper, but never a wife, despite his gallantries at concerts, 
balls and suchlike; pauvre bonhomme que Dieu le bénisse!* 
Come to that, it's time I stopped, for I am beginning to say all 
manner of horrid things about my fellow-men, if not about a 
a to go by the past - b Strangeways, 48 Great Ducie Street. See this volume,

something to be gained by it, as the Quakers say. 
My greetings to Emil,a  Elise and the children and please give my 
kindest regards to Mr and Mrs Heilgers. The weather was too bad

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] Saturday, 27 November 1852 
Dear Marx, 
Assuming I can raise anything towards the cost of printing the 
pamphlet,c it will be at most £2-3—at the moment I am myself in 
a fix. But 3 printed sheets will cost between £10 and £12, and 
even more with stitching, etc., etc. Unless the thing is printed on 
the Continent for the account of, or at least in partnership with, a 
bookseller, it will not get round at all. On reaching Prussia, etc., 
etc., it will be confiscated, and we shall be cheated by the 
booksellers. So we shall have to regard the money as sacrificed on 
this business, for there certainly won't be any return in the way of 
£. s. d. The question now is whether we can spend this amount 
upon it; or at least, whether it might not be better to condense the 
thing into 1-1V2 sheets, so that the cost is rather more 
commensurate with our resources. December and January are for 
me the two most difficult months in the whole year; I can hardly

Communist Trial in Cologne.

consider making any further contribution to the cost before 
February. If we have it printed on credit, the printer will, as with 
Weydemeyer, end up by withholding copies until he has been 
paid.306 And whatever we do, we must begin by finding out what 
prospects there are of its being distributed; at the moment there 
would seem to be virtually none. 
Weerth is coming up to London tomorrow and sails from 
Southampton on 2 December. His OUTFIT cost him a great deal of 
money. Strohn, too, will shortly be travelling to London and 
thence to the Continent. The travelling expenses he must incur in 
establishing himself (on foreign capital to boot, or so I hear) are so 
heavy that we shall not be able to squeeze anything out of him 
either. So we are all of us in a fix. 
It is my opinion that, unless you have reasonably good channels 
of distribution through booksellers, the thing won't even be heard 
of, and, like all literature published by émigrés, will go before 
anyone in Germany has a chance to see it. And that is very 
bad—even worse, in some ways, than if nothing were done at all. 
For it would provide public proof that we are dependent on 
hole-and-corner German emigrant printing presses and are 
powerless to get anything done. We were able to disassociate 
ourselves from the fiasco of Bürgers' circular a by withdrawing into 
our literary sanctum, but even this could be compromised were we 
to admit literary impotence in such a way. The Prussian 
government would be delighted to see us reduced in matters of 
publicity to the same expedients as were available to the 
demagogues of 1831 during their exile,307 i.e. virtually zero. 
Lamentable though this is, it would, I think, be better, if we at 
least did not blazon it abroad. Furthermore, now that the new 
crime of treasonable correspondence [...] has been recognised by 
the jury, we could not send a single copy to the Rhine Province, 
which would be the chief market, without compromising hundreds 
of people. 
I shall send you the money on 1 or 2 December. Consider the 
matter once more and, if you still think it would be better to print 
the pamphlet in this way rather than not at all, you should at least 
try so to arrange things that we do not run into difficulties over 
payments for, as I have said, I can commit myself to nothing 
before February. 
Weerth may already have written and told you that Mr Chr.

experiment and see whether you get it in time for the STEAMER

he had pinned on Graham and Russell; the latter would appear 
to be giving him the cold shoulder. I can see no other explanation for 
his rage on Friday. 3 Not since 1844 has the fellow spoken with such 
fury. HE  IS A DISAPPOINTED  DEMAGOGUE  AGAIN  for as long as this continues. 
By the way, it's a good thing the Tories were in a majority, for now 
we shall get to hear about Disraeli's budget after all. If the chap's 
knowledge and intelligence were greater and his cunning and 
thieving propensities less, nothing would be easier than to arrange a 
FREE  TRADE  BUDGET  for the  FREE  TRADERS  that would make them see stars. If 
only the fellows hold out until the crisis comes! We are décidément in 
EXCITEMENT. Although even this is still going very piano piano But no 
matter. The six pages of JOINT-STOCK prospectuses in today's Daily 
News—on the strength of which it thinks to outshine The Times—are 
bound to have an effect, likewise the 50-80 or so foreign railway, 
gold mining, steamship, etc., etc., companies. Inevitably this will 
create a taste 'for more'. Fortunately the only circumstance which 
might have brought over-production in the cotton industry to a 
premature end has now been eliminated; the new crop will be far in 
excess  of 3 million  bales,  i.e. the biggest there has ever been, and cotton 
is again going down; so there'll be no shortage of raw material. Only 
let the corn harvest fail next year and we shall see a merry dance. 
But unless it does so, it is difficult to say whether anything decisive 
will happen as early as next year, given the abnormal conditions, 
given the mushroom growth of the markets in Australia and 
California where, as there are hardly any women and children, 
one individual consumes perhaps four times as much as elsewhere 
and gold is freely squandered in the towns, given the new market 
which the Calcutta houses are already exploiting in Burma, given 
the way Bombay and Karachi are expanding their trade with 
North-East India and the adjacent territories (particularly so in the 
case of the latter), etc.

MARX TO KARL EDUARD VEHSE 
IN DRESDEN 
[Rough copy] 
[London, end of November 1852] 
Sir, 
No doubt you thought it unusual that I, a stranger, should have 
written to you like an old friend.191  For this you must ascribe the 
blame to Weerth and Reinhardt. However, I realise that I was 
thoroughly mistaken. As an acquaintance of Campe's, that old 
usurer, parjure" and maid-wife-widower, you must have been 
aware that this individual is one of my mortal enemies, and hence 
you had no right to offer him my pamphlet, b thereby affording 
him the opportunity he desired of conveying his impertinences to 
me indirectly and at no risk to  himself.  I am not personally 
acquainted with the individual, although possessed of some 
specific information about him. The fact that I am engaged in a 
fight à mort c with the SHAM  LIBERALS  is enough to expose me to his 
intrigues which, il en peut être sûr, d I shall answer when the time is 
ripe. 
In the second place you had no right whatever, upon receiving 
an inquiry from me, to write to Mr Bangya. So far as I am aware, 
it was I who introduced you to Mr Bangya, but in no sense did I 
present him as my confident in private matters. And it is strange 
to have Campe's insolence conveyed to me through a 3rd party 
whom Mr Campe —I have this on the authority of Weerth here 
and shall inform Bangya accordingly—declares to be a spy. 
Should this letter cause you offence, you need only come to 
London; you know where I live and may be assured that you will 
always find me prepared to give you the satisfaction customary in 
such cases.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 3 December 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
You would long ago have had an answer to your letter 
(enclosing the article for Danaa), had I not been occupied with the 
dictation of the final version of my pamphlet,b  and then delayed 
by visits from Weerth, Strohn, Damm, etc. 
In all probability the pamphlet will be printed in Switzerland by 
Schabelitz JUNIOR, who has left his old man and set up his own 
bookshop. Moreover, if Cluss thinks he can recoup the cost of 
production, he can have the thing printed in Washington. Printed 
it must be, if only so that it may be available as a public document 
after the outbreak of the revolution. I have made some further, 
very interesting discoveries about the Cherval conspiracy, etc., 
which I hope you will be reading in print.309 
Weerth called on Sunday evening, and found me very busy^and 
not in the best of moods. He asked me 'what did I propose, 
actually, to write about the Cologne affair?'—and this in somewhat 
superior, nasal tones. I asked 'what did he propose to do in the 
West Indies?' and, after a quarter of an hour or so, he made off. 
On Tuesday evening he reappeared and said he. had not wished to 
come back, actually, but had yielded to Freiligrath's insistence. For 
on Sunday I had seemed to him very busy and out of temper. I 
took the liberty of pointing out to Mr Weerth that, for 9/10ths of 
the time I had known him, he had always been out of temper and 
MALCONTENT, which was something he couldn't say of me. After I 
had given him a piece of my mind, he pulled himself together and 
became ..the old Weerth again. He seems to me to have become 
damned bourgeoisified and to be taking his career too much 'au 
sérieux'. c Strohn at least is the same as ever, and pas trop fin?

Tomorrow we shall see what reply comes from Mr Bangya. 
Bonaparte is spending some glorious months honeymooning 
with his empire. The fellow has always lived on tick. Simply make 
loan institutions in France as universal and as accessible as possible 
to all classes of Frenchmen—and the whole world will believe that 
the millennium is here. On top of that, a bank of one's own, no 
less, for STOCKJOBBERY and RAILWAY HUMBUG.312  The fellow never 
changes. Not for one moment does the chevalier d'industrie 3 deny 
the pretender, or vice versa. If he doesn't go to war and that right 
soon, he'll founder on his finances. How good that Proudhon's 
plans for salvation should find realisation in the only form in 
which they are practicable—that of the credit racket and more or

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 3 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London,] 7 December 1852 
... Enclosed you will find: 1. A manuscript of mine: Revelations 
Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne. This manuscript went 
off to Switzerland yesterday to be printed there and thence 
pitched into Germany as  étrennes*  for the Prussian gentlemen. You 
should have it printed locally 315 if you believe that sales in 
America will enable you to recoup at least the production  costs,  if 
more, tant mieux!' In which case, advance notices should appear in 
the Press to whet people's curiosity. If the pamphlet does come 
out in America, it should be published anonymously, as in 
Switzerland. To appreciate to the full the humour of the thing, 
you must know that its author, for want of anything decent to 
wear on his backside and feet, is as good as interned and, 
moreover, is and continues to be threatened with truly ghastly 
misère' 1 engulfing his family at any moment. The trial dragged 
me even deeper into the mire, since for 5 weeks, instead of 
working for my livelihood, I had to work for the party against the 
government's machinations. On top of that, it has completely 
alienated the German booksellers with whom I had hoped to 
conclude a contract for my Economy. 45 Finally, Bermbach's arrest 
has deprived me of the prospect of making anything out of the 
Brumaires sent through you—300 had been ordered through him 
as long ago as May. So it's a pretty kettle of fish. d 
Here in London I have made it generally known that the 
pamphlet is to be printed in North America, if only so that we can 
make an incursion from Switzerland behind the Prussians' backs. 
They suspect that something is afoot and by now will have 
ordered the douaniers" and police in Hamburg, Bremen and 
Lübeck to be on the qui-vive.

a New Year's gifts - b so much the better - c poverty - d The original has 'Holland 
in Not' (Holland in distress)—an expression used by the Dutch during the struggle 
for independence (1572-1609), to call out their fellow-countrymen to pierce the 
dykes and drive away the Spanish invaders. - e customs men

and their families.11 See that it appears in various papers. It might 
also be a good idea for you to form committees over there. Here it 
is a matter of a party demonstration. You will observe that Ernest 
Jones actually appears as a party member. In an introductory 
note,  signed by you both, you might specially emphasise that this is 
not a case of begging for the revolution Kinkel-fashion, etc., but 
rather of a definite party aim whose fulfilment is demanded by the 
honour of the workers' party. 
A longish statement (signed by me, Lupus, Freiligrath and 
Engels) about the government's infamies at the Cologne trial has 
appeared in various London papers. b What especially riles the 
Prussian Embassy is the fact that the most distinguished and 
respectable London weeklies, the Spectator and the Examiner, have 
accepted this unvarnished denunciation of the Prussian govern­
ment. 
The Morning Advertiser did not print your letterc; can it have 
smelt a rat? 
The item from the Abendzeitung received from you today, 
according to which I, etc., the police, etc., is a scurrility on the part 
of Mr M. Gross, who has been put up to it by some Willichian or 
other in New York. You will see from my manuscript what kind of 
role this 'honourable' Willich plays in the Cologne trial. I have 
kept a good deal back, partly so as not to impair the literary 
scheme of the whole, and partly for use as fresh ammunition 
should the fellow—which I hardly dare hope—have the courage 
to reply. 
I am tickled by Fickler's letters. Blind, who is now living here 
with his wife, tells me that, during the industrial exhibition,316 
Fickler, good, honest Fickler, rented a large house and furnished 
it sumptuously for the purpose of reletting. The speculation 
misfired. Not only did Fickler make off to America to escape his 
creditors. He also made off without breathing a word of his plans 
to his marriageable daughter who lived with him, and without 
leaving her a single centime. She, of course, was thrown out of the 
house. What became of her after that, no one knows. Good, 
honest Fickler! 
As regards Proudhon, you are both right.317 Massol's delusions 
were due to the fact that Proudhon, with his usual industrial

quackery, adopted as his 'latest discoveries' some of my ideas, e.g., 
that there is no such thing as absolute knowledge, that everything is 
explicable in terms of material conditions, etc., etc. In his book on 
Louis Bonapartea  he openly admits what I had to deduce for 
myself first from his Philosophie de la Misère, namely, that his ideal 
is the petit bourgeois!' France, he says, consists of 3 classes: 
1. Bourgeoisie; 2. Middle class (petit bourgeois); 3. Proletariat. Now 
the purpose of history, and of revolution in particular, is to 
dissolve classes 1 and 3, the extremes, in class 2, the happy mean, 
this being effected by Proudhonian credit transactions, the final 
result of which is the abolition of interest in its various forms. 
General Vetter will be looking up Weydemeyer in New York and 
yourself in Washington. 
Ad vocemc Kossuth. When I learnt through what you sent about 
the initial scandal in the German-American Press over my 'PRIVATE 
CORRESPONDENCE' in the Tribune,d I sent a statement6 to the Tribune, 
signed 'YOUR PRIVATE CORRESPONDENT' of which herewith a summary': 
But to continue. On receiving from you the cutting in which one 
of Kossuth's secretaries describes me as an infamous calumniator, 
etc., and at the same time works for Pierre,g etc., I informed Mr 
Kossuth of the contents of my first statement to the Tribune and 
asked the gentleman for a definitive explanation. Whereupon 
Kossuth replied 1. on his word of honour, that he has no secretary; 
that possibly Benningsen in America, his one-time clerk of 
chancery, had arrogated this office to  himself;  and 2. that the first 
he had heard of the alleged statement had been through me (I 
having sent him the corpus delicti, the slip of paper contained in 
your letter); 3. that he was grateful for my 'WARNING' and would 
again invite me to meet him somewhere on neutral ground. 
Next Friday I shall convey points 1 and 2 to the Tribune again.11 
Keep me au fait with this affair. 
Ad vocem Kinkel. Well, Kinkel has been roving around lecturing 
on modern poetry, etc., in Bradford and Manchester where, like 
the clerical, aesthetic, liberal parasite he is, he paid court to the 
German Jews. People who attended his lectures have informed me

on his aesthetic derring-do as follows: he announces that he will be 
giving a lecture on Goethe's Faust in Bradford, admittance 3/- per 
head. Hall packed. Great expectations. And what does Gottfried 
do? Reads them Faust from cover to cover, and calls this a lecture 
on 'Faust'] Needless to say, Gottfried was wily enough to save up 
this piece of cheating for the very last lecture. In Manchester 
Gottfried declared: 
'Goethe is no poet, he rhymes "erbötig" with " Venedig"; but Immermann is the 
greatest of all German poets.' 
And again: 
'I would venture to say that, of the more recent German poets, 3 in particular 
have enjoyed the favour of the public—Herwegh, Freiligrath and—if I would 
venture to say—Gottfried Kinkel.' 
But easy-going Gottfried also lectured on politics, e.g. on the 
parties in North America. Here is what he said in Manchester and 
Bradford: 
'True,  I announced that I was going to speak about the American parties, e.g. 
Democrats, Whigs, Free Soilers, 318 etc. But in fact there are no more parties left in 
America, than there are in Europe. There remains only the one great party of the 
liberals, as would also become apparent in Germany, if only the defeated party were 
allowed to resume its former position.' 
Finally Gottfried spoke about the Mormons319 of whom, among 
other things, he declared: 
'He who wishes to be rid of all earthly cares should betake himself to the 
Mormons', etc. 
His pronouncements even led people in Bradford to believe that 
he was a Mormon agent. Be that as it may, Gottfried Kinkel left the 
two manufacturing towns profoundly convinced that he must never 
show his face there again. 
At the Assizes in Cologne Beckera has discredited both himself 
and the party. It had been mutually agreed from the outset that 
he would come forward as a non-Leagueb member, so as not to 
lose the good-will of the democratic petty bourgeoisie. But being 
very weak in theory and pretty strong in the matter of petty 
ambition, he was all of a sudden overcome by vertigo. He wanted 
to play the great man of democracy at the communists' expense. 
Not only did he want to get off scot-free, but also carry off in

person what laurels were to be won at the trial. He is not only as 
shameless as ever, he is growing despicable. 
In conclusion, a few words on France. Bonaparte, who has 
always lived on tick, believes that there is no better way of 
bringing about the golden age in France than by making loan 
institutions universal, and as accessible as possible to all classes.S12 
His transactions have a twofold advantage: They pave the way for 
an atrocious financial crisis, and demonstrate what results from 
Proudhon's credit manoeuvres when they are put into practice and 
not confined to theoretical day-dreams, namely a stock-jobbing 
swindle unparalleled since the days of John Law. 
The Orleanists—I know one of their agents3  very well—are 
tremendously active. Thiers is here at the moment. They have 
many allies in the army and in Bonaparte's immediate entourage. 
They intend to murder him (in January) in his bed. Nous verrons!' 
At all events, I shall be notified a fortnight before the attempt, and 
shall in turn notify the revolutionary proletarian party in Paris 
through the secret society of 'frères et amis" 1320 to which I belong. If 
the Orleanists pull the chestnuts out of the fire, they must in no 
case be allowed to eat them. 
Should Heinzen, etc., brag about Becker's performance in 
Cologne, thereby compromising us all, you must publish a 
statement signed with your name, to the effect that Becker was a 
member of the communist society0  and that shortly before his 
arrest, he invited me to write a paper against the democrats, but 
asked me not to reply to the attacks of Heinzen and Ruge, those 
wretched allies of Müller-Tellering. Of course, you should only 
make use of this weapon if absolutely  necessary.  In which case you 
declare outright that Becker took the stage as arranged, but 
grossly over-acted, did not play his part skilfully enough—which is 
all that he can be reproached with.

Dear Engels, 
Like you, I have been suffering all this while from piles. But this

they luckily occurred during the time of lean kine. If necessary 
you should use leeches.  C'est  le grand moyen* 
The money arrived a week ago yesterday. 
From the following copy of a letter from Schabelitz jnr. you will 
see how things stand with the Revelations Concerning the Communist 
Trial in Cologne. 
'Basle, 11 December 1852 
'Dear Marx, 
'I received the manuscript intact day before yesterday, and today am already 
going through the first sheet of proofs. The pamphlet is  SPLENDIDLY  set in a 
completely new type and will appear in 16mo. We shall get the proofs as best we 
can. The whole will amount to 70-80 printed pages and we could, I think, fix the 
price at 10 silver groschen per copy, since part at any rate of the edition (2,000 
copies) is likely to be confiscated. The main consignment will go to the Rhine 
Province. I feel sure the pamphlet will create a tremendous sensation, for it is a 
masterpiece. There were four of us reading through the manuscript, two highly 
competent and discriminating men' 
(do you suppose Schabelitz numbers himself among the 
'competent'?) 
'and we were all unanimous in our praise of it. It certainly constitutes a 
"memorial" to the Prussian government. 
'With kind regards to the Marx party. 
Yours

should take offence at the rough treatment meted out to the

2. You had all the less reason to stand on ceremony since 
Schimmelpfennig —Mrs von Brüningk's crony—had established 
the principle that Marx and Co. were to be calumniated. 
3. You might have issued a statement yourself had Brüningk

Ad vocemh E. Jones. Jones is now RISING rapidly. Harney's 
paper—and J.'s rival— The Star of  Freedom,  set some 3 weeks ago. 
Ad vocem Kinkel-Willich. The effrontery of these two fellows' 
anti-Reichenbach statement surpasses all bounds. 
1. Reichenbach acted too leniently in respect of these fellows in 
concealing the real reason which above all motivated his action. 323 
For in America Loan Notes bearing Reichenbach's signature still 
continue to circulate. Kinkel and Willich got their agents in 
America to convert them into silver, even at a discount, and send the 
proceeds direct to them, long after they had been disowned qua 
financial committee by the London guarantors; similarly, they 
hawked these notes round London. At no time have they accounted 
for the sums thus received. It was downright escroquerie^ and 
Reichenbach deemed a statement necessary in order to clear 
himself of all responsibility for it. 
2. The German papers applauded the resolution to return the 
money to America, Kinkel coming in for especial praise. The rascal 
received these bourgeois plaudits in silence—nor, in Bradford and 
Manchester, did he show any inclination whatever to confess his 
opposition to the said resolution. He seeks to appear respectable to 
bourgeoisie in Germany in order to make money, and poses as a 
believer in revolution before the revolutionary philistines in 
America in order to wrest from the clutches of the Cerberus 
Reichenbach the money he has swindled from them. 
3. Willich pins his faith to the distance between America and 
London. Over here the fellow is regarded by all the refugees as a 
proven spy and a rogue unmasked. He believes that in America he 
will still be able to play the treasurer of the revolution. 
Hirsch has told a working men's club in Blamich Street d that 
Willich is his accomplice. He  himself,  the sly Hirsch (!!!) says, is a 
spy in the interests of democracy, but Willich in the interests of 
the police, no less. Willich's society heard about this. Questions 
a That will be enough. - b re - c swindle - d In the original there is a question

visitors were not admitted, and to shift his own domicile to a remote 
corner of London. These two blackguards must now be unmasked in 
America as well. Here they are completely done for.

that he attended the Wheeling Congress,245  was in Strassburg at 
the time, getting together what remained of his fortune, £300.

MARX TO GUSTAV ZERFFI 
IN PARIS 
London, 28 December 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Friend, 
Sincerest thanks for your letter. 
There were two circumstances which enabled Bangya to 
hoodwink me for so long. Firstly, his acquaintanceship with 
Szemere, whom I instantly recognised as l'esprit fort" of Hungary 
from his manuscript on Görgey, Kossudi, etc., b also,, your 
friendship with Bangya, since you inspired me with complete 
a brains -  *> B. Szemere, Graf Ludwig Batthyâny, Arthur Görgei, Ludwig Kossuth... 

=====第300页=====
268 135. Marx to Zerffi. 28 December 1852 
confidence, despite the fact that we have known each other for so 
short a time. Secondly. So long as I was able, I attributed the 
inconsistencies, lies, etc., to Bangya's urge, which manifests itself at 
the slightest occasion, to shroud his activities in mystery and play 
at hide-and-seek not only with others but actually with  himself. 
At this very moment I am still inclined to believe that he is not a 
true spy; rather, as you rightly say, his function as 'intermediary" 
between the various parties and as political match-maker has led 
him into dubious ways. 
But first a point that is of particular concern to  yourself. 
Szirmay is certainly an agent of Kossuth's. His mission, or so I 
have gathered from some unguarded remarks, is to establish 
contact with Bonaparte through Mr de Maupas. A short time 
previously Kossuth had tried to raise a loan of  1 V2  million from 
the Orleanists through the agency of Bangya and Malingre, his 
correspondent in Paris, but had met with a  rebuff. 
To return to Bangya. 
I have with my own eyes seen a commission made out by Kossuth 
and countersigned by Szirmay, by which Bangya is appointed 
prefect of police in partibus, as it were, by Kossuth—as chief of an 
anti-government counterpolice force. On the one hand, my fears 
over otherwise suspect contacts and acquaintanceships of Bangya's 
were allayed by this commission, for it gave them an air of being 
official connections which, if exploited with skill, could be of use 
to our party; thus I myself have obtained from him some details 
of importance concerning the Prussian government. On the other 
hand, I asked him outright: 'How can you reconcile your 
relationship with Kossuth and your relationship with Szemere?' He 
replied very candidly that firstly he was acting in Szemere's 
interest,, and then the latter had authorised his relationship with 
Kossuth. I therefore never again alluded to the subject. 
Bangya several times invited me on Kossuth's behalf to visit the 
latter. I replied that I lived at such and such a place and that, if 
Mr Kossuth wished to speak to me, he need only take the trouble 
of coming to see me. Kossuth then suggested that we should meet 
on neutral ground.3 I left the matter pending. In the meantime, 
however, an article of mine appeared anonymously in the Tribune 
(New York), in which I attacked Kossuth, Mazzini, etc., with 
especial reference to the intrigues in Paris conducted through 
Kiss,  etc.b Frightful hullabaloo in the American Press! Kossuth 
a See this volume, p. 261. - b K. Marx, 'Movements of Mazzini and Kossuth.— 
League with Louis Napoleon.—Palmerston'. 

=====第301页=====
135. Marx to Zerffi. 28 December 1852 269 
contacting the tyrant! IMPOSSIBLE! Bangya, questioned by Szirmay, 
named me as the author, whereupon I personally told Mr Szirmay, 
that I was indeed the author. Also that, so far as I was aware, I 
was at complete liberty to write anything I chose about and against 
Mr Kossuth. Shortly afterwards I received from America newspa­
pers in which Kossuth had had me denounced 'as a calumniator' by 
a supposed 'private secretary' of Monsieur le Gouverneur. I then, 
via Bangya, requested Mr Kossuth to state whether this démenti 
had originated with him, in which case I would chastise him with 
scorpions, whereas hitherto I had merely touched him with a rod. a 
Kossuth replied, through Szirmay, 1. that he knew nothing about 
the statement, 2. that he had no private secretary, and repeated 
his invitation, which I ignored, to meet him on neutral ground. I, 
for my part, published in the Tribune Kossuth's statement to me,b 
and there, for the time being, the matter rests, although the entire 
inept and insipid German-American press is still buzzing with it. 
Nevertheless, the storm of indignation evoked by his article against 
me shows that Kossuth will be perduc the moment the fact of his 
alliance with Bonaparte is established. 
I am now wholly of the opinion that we should both of us 
observe the utmost discretion for, as soon as Bangya knows that we 
have seen through him, he could do you and Szemere harm, 
perhaps considerable harm, particularly as regards your remaining 
in Paris. Moreover, were Bangya to be in any way publicly 
unmasked before the manuscriptd appears, it could at best only 
make me look ridiculous. Finally, I believe it is important—until 
the point has been reached at which we can publicly unmask 
him—that a close watch be kept on Mr Bangya. This is 
particularly important while he remains in Paris. He is astounding-
ly indiscreet and, if only to retain your confidence, will keep you 
and Szemere informed of every move made by the various parties 
he serves. 
My attitude towards him, therefore, will be cool and reserved— 
as he can only expect after his latest coup—but I shall not let him 
know either the full extent of my suspicion or that I am 'secretly' 
corresponding with you. 
Bangya  himself,  in the note enclosed in his anonymous friend's 
letter, writes: 
'I think you are now at liberty to have the work published elsewhere.'

In giving this advice, which, by the by, is merely the echo of a 
threat I made him, a he is, I think, trying to cover his rear. 
However, I fully agree with Szemere and yourself that it is high 
time this was done. The only difficulty lies in the execution. A 
pamphlet of mine, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in 
Cologne has just been brought out by a Swiss bookseller.325  (I shall 
arrange for 2 copies to be sent to you and Szemere as soon as 
possible.) This same bookseller is busy with an edition of my 18th 
Brumaire for Germany. 326 There is no prospect of inducing him to 
embark on a third undertaking. No bookseller in Germany now 
dares to publish anything of mine. Hence my only recourse would 
be to print it at my own expense, which, in my present cir­
cumstances, is impossible. And yet the thing is vital. I shall 
consider what can be done. 
You will see from the Revelations that Greif is a thoroughly 
infamous creature. In December 1851 he visited Paris in connection 
with the Franco-German plot 143 and in order to establish a spurious 
connection between my friends in Cologne and the idiots in 
Paris. 327 
However, it is true that, while Greif was still here in London, 
Bangya received money from Berlin regularly on the 3rd or 4th of 
each month. Do you know from what sources he is drawing this 
money? 
Our watchword in this business should be: 'à Corsaire Corsaire et 
demi'}'  Should Bangya show signs of becoming 'dangerous', all we 
have to do is remind him that his connections with Malingre and 
the Orleanists have placed him at our mercy. 
Write soon, and assure Szemere that in me he has a sincere 
admirer. 
Yours

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 11 January 1853 
Dear Marx, 
I had hoped that I might have been able to call in on you again 
yesterday on my way to the station for, as a result of a somewhat 
unpleasantly outspoken letter about my prolonged absence313  and 
the work accumulating up here, I was compelled all of a sudden to 
pack my bags and hasten back to the office. Having scandalously 
neglected my business in the  CITY,  I had to settle it yesterday at 
the last moment. This held me up so long that I had no option 
but to set course recta via" if I was to appear today, as I needs 
must, AT  A DECENT HOUR at the office; anyhow, I would have turned 
up at your house at a time in the evening when all your disciples 
are wont to foregather there, in which case I couldn't have 
answered for the consequences, i.e. pots at Göhringer's, Zimmer-
mann's, Wood's and other night haunts. 
It would be best if you were to make a PARCEL of the letters from 
Cluss,  etc., etc., American newspapers and other such  stuff,  and 
send it per Pickford & Co., or Chaplin, Home & Co., addressed to 
me here at Ermen & Engels, so that the firm pays the carriage. 
Waiting for me here was a letter from Madier, in passable 
English, about a patent of his which might have some impact on 
our industry. Whether or not the thing is any good, he has 
all sorts of grand ideas; however, I'll see what I can do. If the 
invention is a good one, it will earn him a hefty sum, the market 
being almost unlimited. Should you happen to run into him, tell 
him I should have written to him one of these days, but I am 
again more than fully occupied.

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS329 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London,] 21 January 1853 
... Yesterday I read a letter from Heinzen to Bamberger. He 
complains of money troubles and says he has been forced to resign 
from the Janus. As regards Dr Kellner, he was for a time 
correspondent of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. You should see if 
you can't make contact with him d'une manière ou d'une  autre} 1 Once 
Weydemeyer has put out feelers, your first step might be to send 
him a 'pithy' article... The wretched Willich, who is done for here, 
sailed for America last week as Kinkel's agent; so it is important 
that at least those parts of the pamphlet 0 which relate to him 
should appear in the press. It would be best if you could arrange 
a A. Herzen, Du développement des idées révolutionnaires en Russie. - b in one way or 
another - c K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne.

for the pamphlet to be published in magazines; it has already 
come out in Switzerland, so it is no longer so important. Could not 
Börnstein, who wants to catch us with 'his bait', also be of some use 
in this matter? From what I know of him and his compagnon" 
Bernays, they will be much tickled by the account of the trickery 
of the police. I think it politic to establish contact with these 
people. I can assure you that if Bernays finds the means—and we 
must provide him with it—to re-establish contact with us, I could 
have these two chaps eating out of my hand. Have you heard 
nothing more from Schramm h or, on the other side, from 
Teilering}...

IN MANCHESTER 
London, 29 January 1853 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
Have received the £3 and the manuscript you returned. 
You must excuse me for not having written for so long, the 
explanation being PRESSURE FROM WITHOUT. 
About a fortnight ago Willich pushed off to America as Kinkel's 
agent. 
Mrs von Brüningk was buried a few days since. 
As a result of clumsy manoeuvring by the Parliamentarians 
Reichenbach and Löwe, and negligence on Imandt's part, the 
£1,000 have again fallen into the hands of Mr Kinkel in the sense 
that the money has been deposited in the Bank of England in his 
name and Reichenbach is to hand over the certificate of deposit to 
him in May, unless the guarantors should decide otherwise. Such 
decisions are, of course, now quite worthless.

276 139.  Marx  to Engels.  29 January  1853 
Since Bonaparte's last speecha  all the  talk in the  City  has  been  of 
war. I have also  had a  letter from  old  Ebner  in Frankfurt  in which 
he speaks  of the  terror inspired  in Germany's pampered puppets, 
especially  the  diplomats  in Frankfurt  am  Main,  by  Bonaparte's 
wedding speech.  The  doltishness  of our  compatriots  was  brought 
home  to me  yesterday  by,  inter alia,  the  Frankfurter Journal  in 
which  a correspondent writing from Heidelberg remarks that, 
what with  a propagandist  war in the  offing  and  Bonaparte 
throwing  in his lot  with 'democracy',  the  authorities must already 
be ruing their prosecution  of the  great Gervinus. 331 I fear that 
Crapulinskib will  be  hailed  as  'friend  and  saviour'  by  German 
peasants  and  philistines. Apparently  the  vocation  of this burlesque 
figure  is to  stand  all  traditional ranks  and  parties  on  their heads 
and turn them into  a laughing-stock. 
What  is the  effect  of a bad  harvest  on an  incipient war? 
Let me  know,  too,  what  the  position  is in the  MANUFACTURING 
DEPARTMENT,  particularly in cotton. 
Jones'  paper0  is again  en  ascendant? 
Cobden's pamphletc and the  MANCHESTER PEACE CONFERENCE  332 are, 
I feel, utterly nonsensical  at the  present time.  So now you  know, 
says Palmerston's journal,  The  Morning Post, these bourgeois 
parvenus  are  totally incapable  of  governing  a country; that's  a 
thing only  the  aristocracy  can do.f The  Morning Herald publishes  a 
letter addressed  to itself  and  written,  or so it  asserts,  at Bonaparte's 
own dictation,  in which  the  latter says  he would come  to England 
only if the  QUEEN  needed 200,000  of his  'heroes  of order'  to combat 
the perilous growth  of  democracy. Which democracy, says  the 
Herald,  is you, Mr  Cobden,  you and  associates. 
Concerning  The  Times,  I have been given  the  following, fairly 
reliable, particulars which  may be of  interest  to you:

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 11 February 1853 
Dear Marx, 
Well, here it is, the grande affaire" of Messrs Kossuth and 
Mazzini. 335 Our news up here is very incomplete but my own view 
is that tomorrow or on Monday we shall certainly hear that all is 
over. Milan is first-rate terrain for street-fighting, few straight 
streets, none connecting with the other, almost everywhere 
narrow, crooked alleys with tall, massive stone houses, each a 
fortress in  itself,  their walls often 3-5 feet or more thick and 
virtually impossible to breach, the rez-de-chaussée 1' windows 
provided with iron grills (almost invariably) as here and there in 
Cologne. But much good will all this do—they don't stand a 
chance. After 1849 Radetzky ordered the restoration of the old 
citadel's fortifications and, if the work is complete—and there has 
been time enough for this—Milan will belong to the Austrians so 
long as they occupy the citadel which is impregnable to insurgents 
unless abetted by a military insurrection. The fact that no further 
news is forthcoming from Bellinzona whence, from time im­
memorial, the Tessinese have inundated the world with lies in 
support of every Italian movement, 336 argues strongly against the 
spread of the insurrection in the surrounding region. 
I regard the whole business as very mal à propos" since its only 
point d'appui, apart from Austrian tyranny IN GENERAL, is the 
commotion in Montenegro 333 where also, après tout? Turkish 
'order' is bound to prevail over Homeric Czernogorzan barbarism. 
Thus these great dictators, having allowed themselves to be 
bamboozled, altogether à la Seiler, by the usual diplomatic 
melodramas, invoke the world-historical importance of the 'orien­
tal question'! They are obviously counting on some sort of WINDFALL

from Louis Napoleon but, unless everything turns out otherwise 
than expected, he will leave them to stew in their own juice and 
treat them as anarchists. It would further seem probable that, as 
with all insurrections organised in advance, the moment of 
outbreak is liable to be determined far more by the pettiest of 
local incidents than by crucial events. 
Mazzini does at least seem to be on the spot; it could hardly be 
otherwise. However stupid his bombastic proclamation, it may well 
prove something of a hit with the grandiloquent Italians. On the 
other hand we have Kossuth, that man of boundless activity! 
Celui-là est absolument mort, après cela? Such absurd pretensions 
cannot be trumpeted with impunity in the year of our Lord 
1853.  However preposterous Mazzini's abstract passion for insurrec­
tion may appear on this occasion, the man comes off splendidly when 
compared with the worthy Kossuth, who reassumes the role he 
played at Vidin 337 and, from the safety of the rear, decrees the 
liberation of the fatherland from nothing, with nothing, for 
nothing. The fellow really is a lâche and a misérable}" 
Now we shall see what the Italian peasants will do; even if, by 
some unheard of and incredible stroke of luck, père Mazzini, his 
bourgeois and his aristocrats, should succeed, they might still be in 
for something very unpleasant at their hands; and should the 
Austrians find an opportunity to unleash these same peasants 
against the aristocracy they will not hesitate to do so. 
The Austrians must still have 120,000 men in Italy; how, in the 
face of this, a rebellion can be staged unless there are mutinies 
among the troops, I cannot conceive. And I refuse to believe that 
there could be Honvedc mutinies in Italy, even on Kossuth's 
orders,*1 this would demand events of greater magnitude, while 3 
years of discipline and peace have enabled the Austrians to flog 
many an unyielding Honved posterior into tractability. 
The whole business is of importance, I think, only as a 
symptom; a reaction has set in against the state of oppression 
obtaining since '49 and, naturally, at the most sensitive spot. The 
thing has made a great impact here, and the philistines are 
beginning to agree that this year will not elapse without trouble.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 23 February 1853 
Dear Engels, 
I have been sérieusement indisposed; for the 'perfidious Prus­
sians'  have not permitted me either to stand, sit or lie down. 
Hence my long silence and my failure so much as to acknowledge 
the money. 
You will have seen that Kossuth, through an American 
filibuster, Captain Mayne Reid, has disavowed his alleged Milan 
proclamation.c339 Well, yesterday Szemere wrote to me from Paris, 
saying he knew for certain that the proclamation was authentic, as 
was evident in any case from its contents. The Leader (pro-
Mazzini) 
* 'deems it his duty to caution his readers, that this affair lies entirely between Mr 
Kossuth and Mr Mazzini and that the latter is absent from England'.*d

Kossuth.340  The par nobile fratrum* seems to have fallen out. 
Kossuth is as false as he is cowardly. 
You have rated Mazzini too high if you imagine he was present 
in person at Milan. At critical moments like these he absents 
himself from England so that he may be suspected of being in the 
theatre of war. 
Pitiable finale though the Milan business is to Mazzini's eternal 
plotting, and despite my conviction that he has done himself 
personal injury, I am sure that the revolutionary movement as a 
whole will benefit by what is happening. I.e., by the brutal manner 
in which the Austrians are exploiting [...]. Had Radetzky followed 
Strassoldo's example, had he praised the Milanese citizenry for 
their 'orderly conduct', had he described the whole thing as the 
wretched uprising of a few 'MISCREANTS' and, as a token of his 
confidence, appeared to loosen the reins a little, the revolutionary 
party would have been discredited in the eyes of the whole world. 
But as it is, by introducing a system of wholesale plunder, he is 
turning Italy into the 'revolutionary crater' which Mazzini, for all 
his declaiming, was unable to conjure into existence. 
And another thing. Could any one of us have believed that, 
after its 4 years of victory, military preparations and rodomontade, 
reaction should feel itself so infinitely weak that, at the first sign of 
a riot, it lets out a scream of genuine terror? The fellows' belief in 
revolution is unshakable. Once again they have testified to the 
whole world how insecure they feel. Whereas realiterh the 
'emigration' is totally bankrupt and impotent, they loudly proclaim 
its power through all government papers and encourage the belief 
that a net of conspiracy is closing in from all sides on the worthy 
citizens. 
Ad vocemc Bangya. Is presently in Paris. I now possess actual 
proof that the gallant fellow is an agent of the Austrian 
government. He bought his way back to France by accepting a 
clandestine post in the-French Police Ministry. At the same time 
he is in Paris as official agent for Kossuth, who wants money from 
Bonaparte. In Paris, by the by, the fellow has woven a net in 
which he himself will become ensnared. As to our manuscript,*1  he 
sold it to  Greif,  who was travelling under the name of 'Schulz'. 
Incidentally, both of them misled the government into believing 
that they had 'managed to procure'—note the professional 
term—this 'document' from the archives of a 'secret society'.

ENGELS TO MARX

[Manchester, 10 March 1853] 
Dear Marx, 
Yesterday I sent off one half of a fiver to you and, at the same 
time,  the other half under cover to Dronke. I'm really in a fix; in 
February I had to fork out some £50 to repay debts, etc., and 
there'll be another £30 or so to be paid out this month and next. 
Otherwise I'd have sent you more. A reform of my  PERSONAL  EXPENSES 
is urgently called for and, in a week or a fortnight's time, I shall 
move into cheaper LODGINGS and also resort to less potent liquor so 
as to prepare myself for the great moment when the balance is 
struck. Last year, thank God, I gobbled up half of my old man's 
profits from the business here. As soon as my old man's arrival 
becomes imminent, I shall remove to select LODGINGS, buy select 
cigars and wines, etc., so that we can impress him. Voilà la vie^

starting  a fracas with  the  cowardly murder  of individual soldiers, 
this being particularly abhorrent  to the  English.  It would  be 
difficult  to imagine anything more craven  and  blackguardly than 
these  two  letters  of Kossuth's  and  withal  the  constant pretension:  I 
AM A PLAIN, HONEST MAN.  The gentlemen should, by the way, beware: 
given  the  evidence,  ce cher* Aberdeen  is just  the  sort  of man to 
have them locked  up and  prosecuted without more  ado and 
whether, after  all this, they could  be quite  so sure  of an  acquittal,  I 
do not  know. 
The  MINISTRY  OF ALL THE  TALENTS343 TURNS  OUT A  COMPLETE HUMBUG. 
Johnny,1  more shrunken than ever;  the  great Gladstone,  a 
self-complacent know-all  à la Mevissen; Aberdeen, full  of diploma-
tic-toryistic reminiscences  and  consummate courtier;  the  late 
messiah Peel's apostle John, Sidney Herbert,  a wholly incompetent 
Secretary  at War,—they're  a fine  LOT.  At the  same time they  all 
feel somewhat  out of  place, except  for  shameless  old  Palmerston, 
who is at  home everywhere  and,  witness  the  Mazzini debate  in 
both Houses, 344 as MUTINOUS  as ever. Indeed, ever since  the  debate 
on Greece,345  the  Militia Bill62  and the  debate  on the  Address,346 
he has  been de facto  LEADER  OF THE  HOUSE  OF COMMONS,  and it is  bitterly 
ironical that,  for  form's sake, poor Johnny should  be given this 
post.  But  when,  in this capacity, Johnny goes  on to ask for a 
salary,  it is  carrying effrontery beyond  all bounds; however  a new 
post is, of  course,  a godsend  to both parties.  I shall  be curious  to 
see Master Gladstone's budget; what  he said about  the  ESTIMATES 
and Hume's Tariff motion 34 leads  one to  expect that  he will leave 
everything more  or less as it was,  which  is about  all that is likely  to 
resuk from this patriotic coalition ministry. Meanwhile,  the  tales  of 
corruption during  the  last election  are  really capital  and  will 
doubtless necessitate some sort  of Reform Bill during  the  next 
session.  If, by  then,  TRADE  has  deteriorated  and the  Continent 
bestirs  itself, we can  expect some fine goings-on. 
I now  have  at home  the  book  by Urquhart,c  the mad MP who 
denounces Palmerston  as  being  in the pay of  Russia.  The 
explanation  is a  simple  one: the  fellow's  a Celtic Scot with  a 
Saxon-Scottish upbringing,  by inclination  a Romantic,  by upbring­
ing a FREETRADER. This chap went  to Greece  as a  Philhellene  48 and, 
after  3 years  of fighting  the  Turks, proceeded  to Turkey  and  went 
into raptures about these self-same Turks.  He enthuses over Islam

Mohammedan'. Turks, particularly those of the Ottoman Empire 
in its heyday, are the most perfect nation on earth in every 
possible way. The Turkish language is the most perfect and 
melodious in the world. All the foolish talk of barbarism, cruelty 
and absurd barbaric arrogance stems solely from European 
ignorance of Turkey and from the biased calumnies of Greek 
dragomans. If a European is maltreated in Turkey, he has only 
himself to blame; your Turk hates neither the religion of the 
Frank, nor his character, but pnly his narrow trousers. Imitation 
of Turkish architecture, etiquette, etc. is strongly recommended. 
The author himself was several times kicked in the bottom by 
Turks,  but subsequently realised that he alone was to blame. 
Contact with Europeans, and attempts at civilisation, have only 
enervated and disorganised the Turks. The Turkish Constitution in 
its 'purity' is the finest there is, and is almost superior to the 
English. The Turk enjoys SELF-GOVERNMENT through customs going 
back a thousand years and through the Koran. The Sultan, far 
from being a 'despot', is more circumscribed than the  MOST  GRACIOUS 
QUEEN.3 Freedom of religion exists only in Turkey. In this paradise 
there are no class differences, class struggles or political parties, 
nor can there be, for in matters of internal politics all are of the 
same mind. Nowhere is there less centralisation than in Turkey. In 
short, only the Turk is a gentleman and freedom exists only in 
Turkey. 
The Czarb is now intriguing against this happy land through the 
agency of Greek clerics, and England has constantly allowed this 
same Czar to lead her by the nose. England must support Turkey, 
etc., etc., and other commonplaces as hoary as they are trivial. On 
the whole this book is highly entertaining. The really choice thing 
about it is that it forms the basis for the entire policy of the 
English, anti-Palmerston liberals, e.g. all the articles in The Daily 
News on the Turkish mummery are simply paraphrases of 
Urquhart who, qua  FREETRADER,  enjoys absolute confidence, al­
though he blames the English for destroying Thessaly's industry 
with their imports—but in a HIGHLANDER a certain licence may be 
permitted. 
There is one good aspect to it, namely that The Times, even 
though primarily in the Russian interest, is at long last attacking 
the old philistine nonsense about Turkey's integrity.0 The asinine 
Daily News which, in its blinkered bourgeois way, can see no

further than the end of its nose, is whining about betrayal but can 
offer nothing better to counter it than the same old diplomatic 
rubbish.2349 If the fun goes on much longer, the gentlemen will 
soon have to resort to other arguments and come round to the 
view that only a continental revolution can put an end to the mess. 
Surely even the most egregious philistines must in due course 
come to realise that, without one, absolutely nothing can be solved. 
The Austro-Prussian tariff business350  is the only step forward 
Germany has succeeded in making— et encore b\ The thing has so 
many strings attached, and so many vital issues have been left to 
later committees, while the actual tariff reductions are so minimal, 
that little will come of it. Come the great industrial crisis, and the 
whole trade agreement will vanish into thin air in the face of the 
general débâcle. 
Here all that happens is thieving, broken bones on the railways, 
and flying up in the air. The local philistines are quite 
dumbfounded by the extraordinary events of the past week. 
Fortunately cotton is going down, which is why nothing is 
happening on the Exchange and people can concern themselves to 
their heart's content with these momentous occurrences. The 
spinning mills and most of the weaving mills are still fully 
occupied, but in coarse calicoes (DOMESTICS) there is total stagnation 
and, as from Monday, all factories in this trade will be working 
only 3 days a week.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 10 March 1853 
Dear Engels, 
Received the £5. 
This week I was within an inch of kicking the bucket. From 
hepatitis, or something very similar. This is hereditary in my 
family. My old mana  died of it. During the 4 years I have been in 
England there hasn't been a sign of the thing and I thought it had 
gone for good. But now the worst is over and, what is more, sans 
médecin!' But I am still somewhat knocked up. 
Yesterday I received the following 'pleasing' letter from Basle: 
'Basle, 7 March 1853. 9 o'clock in the morning. 
Dear Marx, 
I have just heard that the whole consignment of Revelations,c  amounting to 2,000 
copies, which has been lying in a village on the other side of the border for the past 6 
weeks, was intercepted yesterday while being conveyed elsewhere. What will happen 
now, I do not know; first of all, a complaint lodged by the Baden government with the 
Federal Council, then, no doubt, my arrest or at least commitment for trial, etc. In 
either case, a terrific shindy! This briefly for your information; further 
communications, should I be prevented from making them  myself,  will reach you 
through a third party. When writing to me, address the envelope: "Mad. 
Brenner-Guéniard, magasin de modes, Basle" and, on the sealed enclosure for me, 
simply write "For Jacques". I shall deposit the manuscript on the coup d'état in a safe 
place. Adieu. Before long, I hope, I shall be able to tell you more than I now know. Let 
me have a safe address; yours and Bamberger's are probably known. 
Yours 
Jacques e 
Well, qu'en pensez-vous, mon cher maître renard? 1 Has the 'Suisse' 8 
sold me to the Prussian government for cash? 6 weeks in a village

about the copies still in Switzerland, not a copy sent here despite 
my insistence! 
It's enough to put one off writing altogether. This constant toil 
pour le roi de Prusse 3] 
Que faire?b  For the 'Suisse' must not be allowed to get away with it 
like this. 
Quant àc Dana, he has honoured my bill. Originally the 'worthy' 
Bamberger gave me £5 against it, but then kept me traipsing to 
and fro between here and the City for a fortnight, and it was not 
until this week that he finally paid out, after weeks of 'moaning' 
(literally) on the part of my landlady. Since then I have sent 7 
more articles to the Tribune and another one goes off tomor­
row. 351 I could now begin to see my way out of the wood but for 
the accursed dette consolidée 6 hanging round my neck. And even 
this would have been largely paid off had that wretched Swiss not 
precipitated me again into néant' 
To keep in with Dana I shall now be forced to write a somewhat 
longer article on haute politique! In other words, the détestable 
question orientale, regarding which a miserable YANKEE here is trying 
to compete with me in the Tribune.^ But this QUESTION is primarily 
military and geographical, hence outside my département So you 
must once more exécuter? What is to become of the Turkish 
Empire is something I have no clue about. I cannot therefore 
present a general perspective. 
However, for a newspaper article—in which, by the by, you 
must do your best to skirt the QUESTION as such in favour of its 
military, geographical and historical aspects—it seems to me that 
you should touch on the following basic points, which arise 
directly out of Montenegro333: 
1. Despite all the chicanery and the political twaddle in the 
Press,  the question orientale will never be the occasion for a 
European war. The diplomatists will keep quietly tinkering at it 
until here, too, a general hullabaloo puts an end to their tinkering. 
2. ENCROACHMENTS OF RUSSIA in Turkey. Austria's greed. France's 
ambitions. England's interests. Commercial and military signifi­
cance of this bone of contention. 
3. Should there be a general hullabaloo, Turkey will compel 
England to come in on the revolutionary side, an Anglo-Russian 
clash being inevitable in such a case.

4. Inevitable disintegration of Mussulman Empire. D'une manière 
ou de l'autre 3 will fall into the hands of European civilisation. 
At the present, you should dwell more particularly on the 
Montenegro affair, on the deplorable role England is now officially 
playing in it. The Sultan only yielded because France and England 
did not pledge their help. In this affair, both countries used the 
entente cordiale to mask their competing for the favours of the 
Holy Alliance. 353 You should point out that the ruling oligarchy in 
England is bound to fall if only because it has become incapable of 
performing its traditional role abroad, namely maintaining the 
pre-eminence of the English nation vis-à-vis the Continent. 4 
Tout ça est très pauvre, mais enfin, il me faut un ou deux articles sur 
cette question pour tuer mon concurrent}' 
Your 
K. M. 
Your translation of my Sutherland article c is splendid. I myself 
would seem to possess some talent for writing in English, if only I 
had a Flugel, d a grammar, and a better man than Mr Pieper to 
correct my work. 
Today I shall again write to the Continent. Should I succeed, 
now that there's nothing doing with Schabelitz, in scraping 
together at least enough money to ensure my wife's peace of mind 
until a second bill has been drawn on Dana and returned—this 
time I intend to get him up to £30—I might perhaps come and 
spend a few days with you in April, pour restituer mes forces' Then 
we could, for once, chat undisturbed about present conditions, 
which in my view must soon lead to an EARTHQUAKE. 
According to The Morning Post, manufacturers in Lancashire 
have put all their hands on SHORT TIME, PROSPERITY is drawing to an 
end, etc.f What is the situation in this respect?

With their idleness, lack of stamina and inability to sustain any 
PRESSURE  FROM  WITHOUT, they are absolutely hopeless. We must recruit 
our party entirely anew. Cluss is a good man. Reinhardt in Paris is 
hardworking. Lassalle, despite his many 'buts', is dur 3 and 
energetic. Pieper would not be without his uses if he possessed less 
childish vanité and more esprit de suite. h Imandt and Liebknecht 
are tenacious, and each is useful in his own way. But that doesn't 
add up to a party. Ex-lieutenant Steffen, ex- witness at the Cologne

I have received your last lines. You will have read Kossuth's 
various statements.d Even before Mazzini's statement" was pub­
lished I knew that he [Kossuth] had written a most embittered 
private letter about Kossuth to one of his friends here, an 
Englishman.' In connection with this I wrote the following to the 
Daily New-York Tribune: * 'As Mr Mazzini himself has now broken 
the ice I may as well state that Kossuth disowned his own 
document8 under the pressure of his Paris friends. This is not the 
first symptom, in Kossuth's past career, of vacillating weakness, 
inextricable contradictions and false duplicity. He possesses all the 
attractive virtues, but also all the feminine faults, of the Artist 
character. He is a great artist "en paroles".,h I recommend Mr

published in various English newspapers denied his participation in the Milan

anxious to form a matter-of-fact judgment.'*" I sign all my 
articles. Attacks will now follow, so I shall have an opportunity to 
go deeper en matière}' I should be obliged if you would communicate 
to me in good time any news you hear about the emigrants, 
particularly as regards the par nobile fratrum, c With a couple of 
pieces of such information I can always buy myself the right to 
deal with the matter itself in the Tribune. 
Quant <zd Zerffi, whom I have not seen for a fortnight, I told 
him at any rate that if I knew Kossuth personally I would have felt 
it was my duty to warn him against Bangya. It seems to me that 
Zerffi is talkative and somewhat indiscreet. But I do not by any 
means believe that he is to be placed on the same level as Bangya, 
but that he is much more honourable. 
2,000 copies of my Revelations Concerning the Cologne Trial (sent 
to Switzerland on 6 December 1852)e  were confiscated on the 
Baden border 3 months later. I am convinced that Bangya had 
something to do with that too.  C'est  un infâme qu'il faut écraser! 
Pulszky went to America about 4 weeks ago. I think Kossuth 
sent him there to restore the renown he has lost with the Press 
and to intrigue against his opponents. Pulszky will try to get me too 
a bad name with the New-York Tribune, but I prophesy no great 
success for him.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester, 11 March 1853] 
Dear Marx, 
You shall have the articles within a few daysa; I see that my 
CONSIDERATION of Urquhartb  was opportune. Unfortunately it's too 
late for tomorrow's STEAMER, since I can hardly have finished at the 
office before 8 o'clock and some preparation is, of course, still 
necessary. It's grand that père Dana is now paying £2 and 
promptly honouring bills; avec ça, c we shall at last be out of the 
wood. Incidentally, I would never have believed that you had sent 
off seven English articles in such a short space of time d; when you 
come up here, which I much look forward to, you will learn more 
English in a week than in 6 weeks with Mr Pieper. 
As for Monsieur Jacques," it is more than likely that the little 
man wants to imitate the trick played on the Baden government 
by Mr Tenni (whom he greatly resembles), namely sell part of the 
edition to the German governments, and afterwards do business 
so much the better with what is left. I don't believe he is so bad as 
to have sold the whole lot outright. Booksellers established in 
Basle may be justified in feeling nervous; the Basle government 
won't stand any nonsense and is on neighbourly terms with Baden. 
But mind you insist on his sending you forthwith per messagerie, 
i. e. by train, a packet of at least a few copies addressed direct to 
London or, if you like, to me,  CARE  OF Ermen & Engels, 
Manchester. Nobody would think of opening such a packet, and 
even were this to happen, the cat is in any case already out of the 
bag. It's fishy that he should so far have refused to let a single copy 
out of his hands. Surely he must know some manufacturer in 
Basle who sends ribbons, etc., etc., to London, and could include 
some in a consignment. 
There's nothing more to the Lancashire story in The Morning 
Post than what I told you in my yesterday's letter.g In answer to an 
inquiry of ours about prices, Houldsworth and Murray, the two

leading fine spinners in England, told us yesterday that it was 
useless to quote any prices since they were booked up a long way 
ahead and could not accept a single new order. Between them 
these two have about 150,000-200,000 mule spindles in operation. 
In coarse WATER-TWIST, on the other hand, No. 6/16, business is very 
slack precisely because of conditions in DOMESTICS which are sticking 
not only here but also in America and Germany. 
We must destroy the competing YANKEE3 with a great SHOW of 
omniscience. I shall take a look at a few more books on Turkey of 
which there are quite a  LOT  in the Athenaeum.244 
It is not very pleasant to hear about the DECLINE of our friends. 
Nor will it be pleasant if these citoyens" go into the next affair as 
wise as, but no wiser than, they emerged from the last one, though 
when it comes to the point, the 'best' of them will no doubt pull 
themselves together. After Cluss, Lassalle is by far the most useful 
of the lot, and will be all the more so from the moment où les biens 
du comte Hatzfeldt seront irrévocablement réunis au domaine public. cibb 
He may have his foibles, but he also has esprit de parti et ambition, 6 
and we are already aware that he will always make official business 
a pretext for indulging his lesser appetites and pursuing his own 
little private affairs. As for recruiting, that's the way it is; once we 
are back in Germany we shall, I think, find plenty of talented 
young fellows who have, in the meantime, and not without result, 
tasted the forbidden fruit. If we had had the means to conduct 
propaganda scientifically and steadily for the space of 2 or 3 years, 
writing books about n'importe quoi," as we did before 1848, we 
should have been appreciably better off. But that was impossible, 
and now the storm is already brewing. You ought to finish your 
Economy 45; later on, as soon as we have a newspaper, we could 
bring it out in WEEKLY NUMBERS, and what the populus* could not 
understand, the discipuli would expound tant bien que mal, mais 
cependant non sans effet? This would provide all our by then 
restored associations with a basis for debate. 
That Dana is paying £2 per article without demur is the best 
proof of how firmly ensconced you are at the Tribune. Anyway, 
there is a certain advantage in our being the only one of all the 
parties of European revolution to have expounded its ideas before 
the Eng/is/i-American public. The YANKEES know absolutely nothing

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 22[-23] March 1853 
Dear Engels, 
Your article on Turkey3 splendid. Sent off. 
I don't know if you have seen the following comments in a 
recent number of The Economist on the  'VALUE  OF TURKEY'. 
* 'While our commerce with Austria and Russia is either stationary or on the 
decline, with Turkey it is rapidly increasing. We are not able to state what 
proportion of our exports may find their way to Austria through Germany, but we 
believe it [is] only small. Our direct trade with Austria is absolutely insignificant. 
Our exports of British produces to her Adriatic ports (the only ones she has) were 
not given separately from those to the rest of Italy till 1846, when they reached 
£721,981.  In 1850 they had fallen to £607,755 and in 1851 had risen to £812,942. 
Our exports to Russia were on the average of 1840 and 1841: £l,605,000,in 1846 
and 1847, £1,785,000, and in 1850 and 1851, £1,372,000.' 'Our exports to the

Turkish dominions, including Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Moldavia  and  Wallachia, have 
progressed  as  follows: 
£ £ £ 
1840  1,440,592  1844  3,271,333  1848  3,626,241

1843  2,548,321  1847  3,530,589  1851  3,548,959 
Our exports  are  therefore threefold those  to Russia  and  nearly double those  to 
Russia  and  Austria together.' *  356 
So much  for The  Economist* 
There must  be a  considerable  row  going  on  about  the  'TURKISH 
QUESTION'  within  the  English Ministry  itself,  for the  tune being 
piped  by  Palmerston's journal,  The  Morning Post,  is altogether 
different from that  in The  Times. 
Disraeli  has  happily been deposed from  his  LEADERSHIP  of the 
'GREAT  CONSERVATIVE  PARTY'  and his place taken by Sir John Pakington, 
A MOURNFUL  MAN  OTHERWISE.  It is the first time since 1828 that the 
Tory party  has  possessed  a 'LEADER'  no  less mediocre than  its rank 
and file. 
You will have seen that during  the  last division  on the  Clergy 
Reserves Bill, when  the  worthy Russell himself  PROPOSED THE OMISSION 
OF THE 3RD  of his 3  original  CLAUSES,  it was  only  the  votes  of the 
conservative minority that secured victory  for the  Ministry.357  A 
bad sign, that. 
Mazzini  has  been here  for a few  days,  but for the  time being 
incognito. 
That the  'GOOD  ABERDEEN'11  is much inclined to pick on the 
refugees will  be evidenfeto  you  from  the  fact that last week  the 
English police took  a kind  of census  of refugees.  Two or  three 
detectives IN  PLAIN  CLOTHES  went from  SQUARE  to SQUARE  and from 
street  to street, jotting down information, most  of it  culled from 
neighbours  or  nearby ale-house keepers.  In  exceptional cases,

The estimable Barthélémy got away with 2 months' imprison­
ment. 274 The fellow had the effrontery to have Ledru-Rollin 
informed he would shoot him down like a dog. To this Ledru 
replied that he would never exchange shots with such a man. 
Barthélémy, for his part, retorted that, if he wanted to induce a 
man to exchange shots with him, he knew very well how to do 
it—tested methods being to box his ears in public, spit in his face, 
etc. Whereat Ledru sent word that, in such a case, Barthélémy 
would become acquainted with his stick and with an English 
MAGISTRATE. This Barthélémy seems intent on becoming the Rinaldo 
Rinaldini of the emigration. Some ambition! 
Père Willich has landed in New York. Friend Weitling organised 
a banquet for him attended by 300 persons, at which Willich 
appeared in a vast red sash, made a long speech to the effect that 
bread is worth more than liberty, and was presented by Weitling 
with a  sword.  Then Weitling took the floor and proceeded to prove 
that Jesus Christ was the first communist and his successor none 
other than the well-known Wilhelm Weitling. 
I have received a letter from Schabelitz, which I enclose and 
from which it emerges 1. that, though he has not betrayed us 
politically, he has behaved very stupidly indeed; 2. that he meant, 
and still means, to swindle me, at least commercially. Originally, 
and under the contract, he was to run off only 2,000 copies.3  From 
his letter it appears that he has run off more. How many, he has 
still not divulged. At the same time Dronke has received an answer 
from Dr Feddersen to whom he had written about the matter. 
Feddersen confirms Schabelitz's letter, but at the same time states 
that, in his opinion, nothing would come of a judicial inquiry 
concerning Schabelitz. The question is, what is to be done? The 
Prussian government wants to hush the whole thing up, so much 
so that the Foreign Minister 13 is looking for a Theory of Communism 
allegedly published by me in Basle. So even the title is to be kept 
from the public. Que faire?c 
Schabelitz sent me 2 copies, 1 direct to me and 1 to Freiligrath, 
which together cost me 15/-. A fine return! So far I have not been 
able to drag the copies away from the gang. But I think I might 
succeed in getting hold of one by Wednesday (tomorrow) and will 
send it with the parcel that has long been waiting to go off to you. 
Zerffi is here. He fled from Paris during the razzia on foreign 
correspondents. He believes that friend Bangya (who, by the by

and en passant, is said to be finding life difficult and intends to 
return here in May) had denounced him as the author of a 
number of articles in the Kölnische Zeitung compromising to the 
'Blonde Souveraine'.* Zerffi is a chatterbox, but his opinions on 
conditions in Hungary are more independent and accurate than 
any I have yet heard expressed by refugees from that country. 
This may be due to the fact that he is no Magyar born and bred, but a 
'Swabian', and not only a Swabian but the son of a Hanover Jew, 
whose name was probably Cerf and was magyarised as Zerffi. 
What wretchedly indolent dogs our people in Germany are! Not 
a word has come through from the fellows. By now they'll have 
seen from the newspapers that a pamphlet has been published 
about their case. But they don't so much as inquire about it. 
There's no responsiveness, no élan about the chaps. Old women— 
voilà tout. h 
A funny piece of news in La Nation will hardly have come your 
way in Manchester. That angel Montijo suffers, it seems, from a 
most indelicate complaint. She is passionately addicted to farting 
and is incapable, even in company, of suppressing it. At one time 
she resorted to horse-riding as a remedy. But this having now 
been forbidden her by Bonaparte, she 'vents'  herself.  Ce n'est qu'un

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 234 
IN WASHINGTON 
London, 25 March  1853 a 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Cluss, 
Your complaints about our (or at least my) laziness in the matter 
of writing are not WHOLLY justified. I used to write—save when 
ill—once a week. It was you who first replaced this with a 
different system, and often just sent newspapers in the interval 
instead of letters. There are  ALL  IN ALL 3 letters from you that have 
remained unanswered. Of those 3, two came on the same day, one 
enclosed with the money sent to Freiligrath, one direct to  myself. 
Hence, only 2 unanswered letters.358 If you go back to writing 
once every week, whether at length or briefly, I too will again 
adopt this regular MANNER. Or rather, I shall do so without waiting. 
But then I shall expect the same of you. 
Schabelitz has now written to me at length. He had printed the 
Revelations pamphlet 2 months ago and, for the space of 5 weeks, 
left it lying at Weil, a Baden village on the other side of the 
border. Instead of posting a reliable man there, the jackass went 
and left everything to the smuggler who, having gradually 
extracted from him a substantial sum of money, ended up by 
giving himself away to the Baden government. The rest you will 
have seen in the last issue of the Tribune? But you will be even 
more convinced of the interest taken by the Prussian government 
in this pamphlet, and hence of its importance to the 'Fatherland', 
when I tell you that the heroic Stieber has not only become 
police superintendent in Berlin but is co-opted onto every 
ministerial council concerned with precautionary measures against 
revolutionaries and revolutionary activities. I am almost beside 
myself with anger at the pamphlet's temporary suppression. You 
for your part would not appear to have handled matters on this 
occasion with your usual felicity. The Neu-England-Zeitung may 
take a year to get it out by thus printing it in dribs and drabs,3  9 
whereas it devotes whole columns to the 'figure de fouine" 2 of the 
wretched Ruge who, over here, has still not succeeded in acquiring

more than a 'strictly circumscribed train' of 5 persons. Why didn't 
you put the thing into the Demokrat, a much more widely read organ, 
to which you yourself contribute? Next time you write you must 
tell me frankly whether or not the thing can be produced as a 
pamphlet in America. It would be for European consumption and 
would be tossed into Prussia via Hamburg. If I were not utterly 
devoid of means I would arrange for it to be printed in Altona 
forthwith. It is not partiality to the little lampoon, but my perfect 
knowledge of conditions in Prussia which prompts me to say that, 
at the present moment, we could deal our beloved Prussians no 
more telling blow. 
Don't lose sight of that blackguard Willich. He is the most rabid 
of enemies and an idiot into the bargain. 
Pulszky has not come among you simply to engage in high 
politics. He has also been sent across the ocean for the purpose of 
appeasing General Vetter who, having become  DISAFFECTED,  is 
intriguing from America against the 'GREAT Kossuth'. To my 
amazement I see in the Daily Tribune, received from you today, 
that it has accepted my attacks upon Kossuth-Mazzini. a I had 
thought this highly improbable, the more so since Greeley's 
WHITE-RED-BLACK FRIEND, the Jew Pulszky,b is over there. 
Szemere wrote to me from Paris giving me the news I published 
in the Tribune, namely that there had been a lengthy conference 
between Kossuth and his Parisian PARTISANS about his now 'DISOWNED 
PROCLAMATION'0 and that they forced the miserable little man to 
make a disavowal. 
Barthélémy, Willich's friend, whom you will remember from his 
duel with Schramm 360 (the latter, by the by, lives in Cincinnati 
whence he has written once), has received a 2 months' sentence 
for fighting a duel on English soil in the course of which he killed 
Cournét. He got off so lightly, despite the sordid DISCLOSURES which 
were made during the trial, because according to English law, 
seconds are punished as severely as duellists and also because they 
didn't want to make the poor devil pay the full penalty for what 
he had done. The fellow had the effrontery when in prison to 
have a message sent to Ledru saying that as soon as he came out 
he would shoot him down like a dog. Ledru replied that he would

not exchange shots with such a scoundrel. Barthélémy: He was very 
well able to induce a man to exchange shots with him by boxing 
his ears in the open street, and other such tested methods. Ledru 
(riposte): That being so, he would regale him with his stick. 
The winsome warrior, Schimmelpfennig, has inherited £1,000

ant had appointed himself to the post of sycophant, nursery-maid, 
fan-bearer, political oracle, companion, admirer, boots, and any 
other agreeable function you may care to name. 
Reichenbach wants to go to America, as does—up to a point— 
Kalb of Löwe, b the first as a farmer, the second as a doctor. 
In the West, the most important, if least conspicuous event, has 
been the burial of Madame Raspail in Parisc. The unexpected 
turn-out of 20,000 proletarians  IN FULL DRESS  utterly dumbfounded 
the Bonapartists. So you can see that the proletarian lion isn't 
dead. For Ledru, too, the event was a most bitter pill. Raspail is 
his arch-enemy. 
One more  FACT.  Don't blame me if it is unaesthetic. The 'blonde 
souveraine', Montijo-Lola, d is subject to a most repellent constitu­
tional complaint—incessant farting. It is known as tympop-
tanomania. Formerly she used to combat the 'ACCIDENT' with 
energetic horse-riding which Bonaparte has now forbidden her on 
the grounds that it is beneath her station. Thus at several 'réunions' 
her 'détonations fortes'" have even brought blushes to the cheeks of 
braided Decembraillards/ And that is saying a great deal. Ce n'est

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] Sunday, 10 April [1853] 
Dear Marx, 
I return herewith Cluss' letter.361 And there, it seems, the matter 
will have to rest until we have before us the whole of Hirsch's 
document," and also his first statementb  which Weydemeyer has 
retained (do you know anything more about this?). The Bangya 
business isn't very nice; however, au bout du compte, c it is better to 
settle it»now than later. According to what you write you have full 
proof against Bangya to hand now, and, of course, there is also 
Zerffi to vouch for the Greif business. 0 Knowing as we do now 
what is coming, we have time to prepare a proper answer." I shall 
look out Bangya's and the fictitious Collmann's letters.' So far as I 
am concerned, the pamphlet8 can be printed in America. 
Some of the things in Hirsch's statement are perfectly correct, 
e.g. concerning your letter from Manchester.362  At the same time, 
of course, he does his fair share of lying and keeping things under 
his hat. For instance, he forgets to say that he followed you to 
Manchester, clearly not by accident, and that, meeting us one 
Sunday in the Bury New Road with another loafer, he called out 
quite loudly as he went by: 'Good morning, Marx!' You will recall 
that we wondered who it might be; ce fut notre cher Hirsche 
Likewise the affair of Mrs Daniels' letter and the domiciliary 
visit. 260 
It is curious how many spies à la Cooper 363 seem to be turning 
up just now. Chenu, Cherval, Hirsch. It's a good thing Hirsch now 
testifies that Bangya was never able to report anything about you 
except personal tittle-tatde. 
Inquiries must be made about the persons mentioned. Lan-
ckoronski is clearly none other than the 'Count L.' denounced by 
a W. Hirsch, 'Die Opfer der Moucharderie. Rechtfertigungsschrift', Belletristisches 
Journal und New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung, Nos. 3-6, 1, 8, 15 and 22 April 
1853.  - b W. Hirsch, 'Erklärung [of 12 January 1852]', Belletristisches Journal und 
New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung, No. 7, 29 April 1853. - c after all - d See this volume, 
pp. 242-45. - e K. Marx, 'Hirsch's Confessions'. - f  See this volume, pp. 239, 256

you as a Russian agent in the Kossuth-Bonaparte article.2 As far as 
Bangya is concerned, we are fully covered by Kossuth and 
Szemere and, if he possessed a manuscript of Szemere's,b why not 
one of ours?c It's an excellent thing that we have always kept 
everything that came our way. 
Apropos. Not long ago Dronke made a terrible fuss about my 
not providing him AT A MOMENTS NOTICE with the Reichenbach 
circular 299 and now, in the parcel of American papers, I find it 
reproduced at least ten times. Couldn't the lazy devil have 
searched it out himself? 
Pour revenir.6  I don't believe anything can be done publicly for 
the time being, i.e. until we've had a thorough examination of the 
documents; preliminary steps, no more—for instance, finding out 
where the document came from, the present whereabouts of 
Hirsch and what he is doing and, if necessary, confronting the 
fellow in order to extract another written statement from him. I 
shall also take immediate steps to find out more about the business 
of Fleury and the theft 364; unfortunately my informant, a personal 
acquaintance of his, is ill. Mind you send me without delay the 
requisite personal description, etc., etc. 
Today I have leafed through most of the American papers sent 
to me. Much is very amusing but, when there's such a pile of 
them, it's a very trying and stultifying job. By comparison, Cluss' 
letters are a delight. I see that the Revelations are already 
appearing in the Neu-England-Zeitung365; it's really too bad of 
Weydemeyer not to have got them into the Criminal-Zeitung. The 
least he can now do is to catch up with the main content—drop 
him a heavy hint to that effect by the next STEAMER, otherwise it 
may never occur to him. 
I have not yet read the pile of (New York) Demokrats in which 
Weydemeyer publishes his articles; I'm saving them up for this 
evening. 
Between ourselves, I am now pretty well convinced that it was, 
after all, Monsieur Bangya who betrayed Kothes' address." It's a 
good thing nobody knows about it. 
If the business of Hirsch and Bangya becomes any more 
involved, there'll be another job for us to do when you come up.

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 1 
IN NEW YORK 
Manchester, 12 April 1853 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
Herewith Marx's statement on Hirsch's Confessions" which you 
should immediately get into as many papers as you can. If you send 
Cluss a copy at once, he will undoubtedly be able to take over a 
large part of the task. It would, I think, do no harm if you were to 
append the words, 'The undersigned express their full agreement 
with the above, E. Dronke, F. Engels'. As far as the business of the 
manuscript b is concerned, and relations with Bangya generally, we 
are just as responsible as Marx and it would not be right if we 
were to let him bear the responsibility alone. The copy that was 
handed overc is partly in Dronke's hand, the original almost 
entirely in mine. There is now a prospect of the thing being 
published in Switzerland. 
This statement was composed solely on the strength of the 
excerpts made by you and sent to us by Cluss.d Whether the 
remainder contains anything that will necessitate a further 
statement, we cannot, of course, yet say, but doubtless you'll have 
a K. Marx, 'Hirsch's Confessions'. - b  K. Marx and F. Engels, The Great Men of the 
Exile. - c to Bangya - d  excerpts from Hirsch's article 'Die Opfer der Mouchar-
derie. Rechtfertigungsschrift', then being prepared for the press.

extracted everything relating to ourselves. In a few days' time you 
will, I trust, send us the whole thing in print. 
As for Bangya, we have him completely in our power. The 
fellow's so deeply implicated that he is utterly done for. Fresh 
grounds for suspicion kept cropping up and, in order to cover 
himself he was compelled to show Marx little by little his entire 
hoard of documents from Kossuth, Szemere, etc. This is how I 
come to possess the original manuscript of Szemere's pamphlet on 
Kossuth and Görgey. Mr Kossuth, then, has been badly compro­
mised through Mr. Bangya. This magyarised Slav's petty cunning 
was foiled by Marx's tenacity and the skill with which he 
implicated him. We, and no one else (save perhaps Szemere, up to 
a point), now possess complete documentary evidence as to 
Bangya's character, but what purpose would be served by raising 
the alarm just now? The fellow is said to be returning to London 
in May, and then we can press him hard and possibly extract a 
great deal more useful information. All manner of things have 
been going on between Willich and Hirsch which are still very far 
from clear and if, as you maintain, it was through Kinkel's agency 
that Hirsch's manuscript found its way over there, this again 
conjures up the most bizarre speculations. Il faut tâcher d'y voir 
clair, 3 and Bangya can be useful there. So don't say anything about 
it for the moment; that apart, let the Hungarian gentlemen 
themselves come forward for once and speak their minds, Kossuth 
in particular. Why should we give them a helping hand? If they 
make fools of themselves in a public statement, tant mieux, h then it 
will be our turn. 
The émigrés are carrying on as disreputably as ever, though 
with less public offence than hitherto. When I was in London at 
Christmas-time, 31* we used to mingle sans façon with the crowd in 
the Kinkel-Willich-Ruge pubs, something we could scarcely have 
done 6 months earlier without risking a brawl. Often the small fry 
would come up to us quite amiably and patiently allow us to twit 
them, particularly the gallant Meyen-Julius Vindex. c Amongst our 
own people, everything is still much the same. Lupus is said to be 
keeping himself very much to  himself.  Dronke has been angling 
for a clerk's post these past six months and now there's a scheme 
afoot to get him one in Bradford, 2V2 hours by railway from here. 
Weerth, when I last heard from him, was in St Thomas in the 
West Indies, where he had survived the yellow fever season. Red 
a We must try to clarify this - b so much the better - c  An analogy between 
Eduard Meyen and the Roman general Julius Vindex.

Wolf a who, as you know, is a husband and father, takes his wife 
and child out on jaunts and seldom puts in an appearance. 
Freiligrath is still living in Hackney and engages in commerce 
under the auspices of Mr Oxenford.b As for  myself,  I have made 
substantial progress this past winter in Slavonic languages and 
military affairs and, by the end of the year, shall have a passable 
knowledge of Russian and South Slav.c In Cologne I accoutred 
myself at little expense with the library of a retired Prussian 
artillery officer and for a time felt myself quite the bombardier 
again, what with the old Pliimicke,d the Brigade Training Manual 
and other well-thumbed volumes which you will remember. 
However, Prussian military literature is positively the worst there 
is, the only tolerable stuff being what was written with the 
campaigns of 1813/15 still fresh in mind. But after 1822 this gives 
way to a repulsively pretentious pedantry, to a bogus omniscience, 
which is the very devil. Quite recently a number of passable things 
have again appeared in Prussia, but not many. Unfortunately the 
French stuff is completely inaccessible to me owing to my 
unfamiliarity with specialised literature. 
I have swotted up pretty well on the old campaigns (i.e. after 
1792);  the Napoleonic ones are so simple that it would be difficult 
to go wrong on them. However, au bout du compte e Jomini gives 
the best account of them; despite many fine things, I can't really 
bring myself to like that natural genius, Clausewitz. 367 For the 
immediate future, i.e. for us, the Russian campaign of 1812 is the 
most important, the only one where important strategic problems 
still remain to be solved; Germany and Italy do not admit of any 
lines of action other than those laid down by Napoleon, whereas in 
Russia everything is still very confused. The question whether, 
originally, Napoleon's plan of operations in 1812 was to march 
directly on Moscow or, during the first campaign, simply advance 
as far as the Dnieper and Dvina, repeats itself for us with the 
question as to what a revolutionary army should do in the event of 
a successful offensive against Russia. This question—accidents 
apart, of course, and assuming no more than an approximately 
equal balance of forces—can be solved, or so it has seemed to me 
up till now, only by water—in the Sound and in the Dardanelles, 
at Petersburg, Riga and Odessa. Apart also, of course, from 
internal movements in Russia—and an aristocratic-bourgeois

revolution in Petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior is 
a possibility. Mr Herzen has made things much easier for himself 
(Du progrès des idées révolutionnaires en Russie 3) by positing, 
Hegel-fashion, a democratic-social-communist-Proudhonist Repub­
lic of Russia under the triumvirate Bakunin-Herzen-Golovin, so 
that it cannot possibly fail. Meanwhile it is by no means certain 
that Bakunin is still alive and in any case Russia, with its huge 
expanses and sparse population, is a country that is very difficult 
to conquer. As to the former Polish provinces on this side of the 
Dvina and Dnieper, I want to hear nothing more of them, 
knowing as I do that the peasants there are all Ukrainians, only 
the aristocracy and some of the people in the towns being Polish, 
and that to the peasant there, as in Ukrainian Galicia in 1846, 368 
the restoration of Poland is synonymous with the restoration of 
the old ruling aristocracy, its powers unimpaired. In all these 
countries, outside the kingdom of Poland proper, there are barely 
500,000 Poles! 
It is a good thing, by the way, that this time the revolution 
should have found a respectable antagonist in Russia and not such 
spineless scarecrows of opponentsb as in the year 1848. 
In the meantime all sorts of symptoms keep appearing. 
Prosperity in cotton has reached such heights as to become 
vertiginous, whereas certain branches of the cotton industry 
(coarse qualities, DOMESTICS) are completely stagnant. Speculators 
hope to escape this vertigo by promoting it en grosc solely in 
America and France (railways with English money), but over here 
piecemeal in penny packets, thus by degrees spreading the 
condition to all articles. The quite abnormal weather we've had 
here during the winter and spring must have damaged the corn 
and if, as usually happens, the summer is also abnormal, it will 
* spell ruin to the harvest. To my mind the present prosperity 
cannot last beyond the autumn. In the meantime the 3rd English 
ministry in 12 months—and, indeed, the last one that will be 
possible without the direct intervention of the radical 
bourgeoisie—is falling into disrepute. One after another Whigs, 
Tories and Coalitionists come to grief as a result, not of a tax 
deficit, but of a SURPLUS.369 That typifies the whole policy of the old 
parties and also their extreme impotence. If the present ministers 
tumble, it will no longer be possible to govern England without

considerably extending the pays légal 3; hence, this is likely to come 
about at the beginning of the crisis. 
The protracted tedium of prosperity has made it almost 
impossible for the unhappy Bonaparte to maintain his dignity; the 
world is bored and he bores the world. Unfortunately he cannot 
remarry every 4 weeks. This trickster, drunkard and cheat will 
come to grief through having to make a pretence of putting 
Engel's Fürstenspiegel into practice. The vagabond as 'father of the 
fatherland'! He is aux abois!' Yet he can't even start a war: 
everywhere serried ranks bristling with bayonets as soon as he 
makes the slightest move. And then this period of tranquillity 
affords the peasants most desirable time in which to reflect upon 
how the man who promised to subdue Paris for the peasants' 
benefit is now using the peasants' money to embellish Paris and 
how, despite everything, mortgages and taxes are going up rather 
than down. In short, this time the thing is being methodically 
prepared, and that's very promising. 
In Prussia the government has raised a veritable hornet's nest 
among the bourgeoisie with its income tax. The bureaucrats have 
increased the rates of tax in the most barefaced manner, and you 
can imagine the glee with which those egregious quillpushers are 
now poking their noses into the trade secrets and ledgers of all the 
merchants. Even my old man, a dyed-in-the-wool Prussian, is 
fuming with rage. These fellows must now endure to the bitter 
end the blessings of a constitutional, fatherly, Prussian gouverne­
ment à bon marché! Prussia's national debt,— some 67 mill, talers 
before 1848,—must since have swollen to four times that amount, 
and already they are wanting to borrow again! One can only 
assume that the portly monarch d would cheerfully sweat now, as 
once he sweated during the March days,e if only he were to be 
guaranteed this credit for the rest of his mortal life. Yet Louis 
Napoleon has helped him set the Customs Union on its feet again, 
Austria, fearing war, has drawn in her horns,s7° 'and now, Lord, 
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace into the grave'!f 
The Austrians are doing everything in their power to set things 
in motion again in Italy, a country which, before the Milan 
uprising,335 was completely given over to commerce and prosperity 
in so far as this was compatible with taxation; and if everything 
goes on like this for another few months, Europe will be in a 
splendid state of readiness, needing only the jog of a crisis. On top

of this, one must consider that prosperity, unprecedented in its 
scope and duration—having begun early in 1849—has restored 
the strength of the exhausted parties (in so far as these were not 
beyond repair, like the monarchist party in France) much more 
quickly than was the case after 1830, for example, when trading 
conditions long remained unsettled and, on the whole, indifferent. 
In 1848, too, only the Paris proletariat, and later Hungary and 
Italy, were exhausted by severe struggles; after June 1848, the 
insurrections that took place in France were hardly worth speaking 
of and, in the final count, ruined only the old monarchist parties. 
Add to this the curious result produced by the movement in all 
countries, a result in no way serious or significant save for the 
colossal historical irony and the concentration of Russian military 
resources; and in view of all this, it seems to me that, even taking 
the most sober view, the present state of affairs cannot possibly 
continue beyond the spring of 1854. 
How splendid it is that on this occasion our party is taking the 
stage under wholly different auspices. All the socialist stupidities 
which one still had to advocate in 1848 vis-à-vis the pure 
democrats and the South German republicans, the vapourings of 
L. Blanc, etc., and, indeed, even the things we were compelled to 
propound if only to find points d'appui for our views in the 
confused state of affairs in Germany—all this is already being 
advocated by our respected opponents, by Rüge, Heinzen, Kinkel 
and so forth. The preliminaries to proletarian revolution, the 
measures by which the field of battle is being made ready and the 
way cleared for us—a single and indivisible republic, etc., things 
which originally we had to advocate in the teeth of those whose 
natural, normal calling it should have been to implement, or at 
least demand them,— all this is now convenu, 3 has been learnt by 
the gentlemen. This time we shall start off straight away with the 
Manifesto? thanks largely to the Cologne trial in which German 
communism (most notably through Röser) has passed its matricu­
lation. 
All this, of course, relates merely to theory; in practice we shall, 
as always, be reduced to insisting above all on resolute measures 
and absolute ruthlessness. And that's the pity of it. I have a feeling 
that one fine day, thanks to the helplessness and spinelessness of 
all the others, our party will find itself forced into power, 
whereupon it will have to enact things that are not immediately in 
agreed - b  K. Marx and F. Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party. 

=====第341页=====
150. Engels to Weydemeyer. 12 April 1853 309 
our own, but rather in the general, revolutionary and specifically 
petty-bourgeois interest; in which event, spurred on by the 
proletarian populus and bound by our own published statements 
and plans—more or less wrongly interpreted and more or less 
impulsively pushed through in the midst of party strife—we shall 
find ourselves compelled to make communist experiments and 
leaps which no one knows better than ourselves to be untimely. 
One then proceeds to lose one's head—only physiquement parlant" I 
hope—, a reaction sets in and, until such time as the world is 
capable of passing historical judgment of this kind of thing, one 
will be regarded, not only as a brute beast, which wouldn't matter 
a rap, but also as bête^ and that's far worse. I don't very well see 
how it could happen otherwise. In a backward country such as 
Germany which possesses an advanced party and which, together 
with an advanced country such as France, becomes involved in an 
advanced revolution, at the first serious conflict, and as soon as there 
is real danger, the turn of the advanced party will inevitably come, and 
this in any case will be before its normal time. However, none of this 
matters a rap; the main thing is that, should this happen, our party's 
rehabilitation in history will already have been substantiated in 
advance in its literature. 
We shall, by the way, cut a far more respectable figure on the 
stage than last time. In the first place we are happily rid of all the 
old idlers in the persons of Schapper, Willich and Co., secondly, 
we have grown somewhat stronger, thirdly, we can count on the 
rising generation in Germany (if nothing else, the Cologne trial is 
enough to guarantee us this), and finally we have all of us 
benefited substantially in exile. There are, of course, some 
amongst us who proceed on the principle: 'What need is there for 
us to swot? That's what père Marx is there for, it's his business to 
know everything.' But in general the Marx party does do a good 
deal of swotting, and one only has to look at the way the other 
émigré jackasses snap up this or that new catchword, thereby 
becoming more bemused than ever, to realise that our party's 
superiority has increased both absolutely and relatively. As indeed 
it must, for la besogne sera rude!" 
I should like to have time before the next revolution to study 
and describe thoroughly at least the campaigns of 1848 and 1849 
in Italy and Hungary. Generally speaking, I have a pretty clear 
notion of the business, despite imperfect maps, etc. But the very 
a physically speaking - b stupid - c it will be a tough business

accuracy of detail required to depict it calls for a great deal of 
trouble and expense. On both occasions the Italians behaved like 
nincompoops. Willisen's account and analysis, while accurate on 
the whole, is often silly, 3 and the total superiority of Austrian 
strategy, which he stresses as early as 1848, only becomes apparent 
in the Novara campaign,371  without doubt the most brilliantly 
fought affair in Europe since Napoleon's day (outside Europe, 
however, the feats performed by old General Napier in India in 
1842 are of quite another order and, indeed, reminiscent of 
Alexander the Great; on the whole I regard Charles Napier as the 
foremost living general). Strange in Italy, just as in Baden in 1849, 
is the traditional superstitious belief in positions occupied during 
the campaigns of the 1790s. Nothing would have induced 
Mr Sigel to fight anywhere save in the position made classical by 
Moreau, and Charles Albert's belief in the Virgin Mary's virginity 
was no more steadfast than his belief in the miraculous powers of the 
plateau of Rivoli. So immutable was this conviction in Italy that the 
Austrians commenced every important manoeuvre with a feint 
attack on Rivoli and every time the Piedmontese fell into the trap. 
The joke is, of course, that the relative positions and lines of com­
munication were quite different. 
Despite everything, Monsieur Görgey remains the only fellow in 
Hungary who was superior to everyone else and to whom 
everyone else was hostile out of sheer envy; I think it probable 
that had not Görgey, despite his great military talents, been a very 
vain, petty chap, this for the most part stupid hostility would have 
finally turned him into a traitor. Ever since the Vilâgos affair 372— 
entirely justified in military (but not revolutionary) terms—the 
fellows have subjected Görgey to such a plethora of insane 
accusations that the chap almost compels one's interest. The actual 
'betrayal' took place after the relief of Komarom, 373 before the 
Russians got there, and for this Kossuth is just as much to blame 
as Görgey. A cloud of uncertainty still envelops Bayer, Görgey's 
Chief of the General  Staff,  who is now in London. From the 
memoirs of Görgey b and other sources, it would seem that it was 
he who inspired Görgey's strategic plans. From what Pleyel told 
me, Bayer is the principal author of the official Austrian book on 
the campaign. 0 (Bayer was captured in Pest and escaped); it is said

to be excellent, but I haven't yet been able to get hold of it. 
Görgey speaks of Klapka with great respect, but everyone admits 
that he was very weak. Perczel is regarded as a jackass, the 
'democratic' Hungarian general. Old Bern always thought of 
himself only as a good partisan and commander of a detached 
corps intended for a definite purpose; so far as I can judge, this is 
all he was, but to a superlative degree. He did two stupid things, 
once with his fruitless expedition into the blue after Banat; next, 
during the great Russian invasion when he repeated, literally, the 
highly professional manoeuvre he had successfully executed 
before Hermannstadt and was trounced in consequence. 374 Père 
Dembiriski, however, was an incorrigible visionary and braggart, a 
partisan who believed himself born to conduct great campaigns 
and embarked on the maddest enterprises. Smitt's Polish Cam­
paign of 1831 a contains some good stories about him. 
Apropos. Could you give me a short description of Cologne's 
fortifications with a few drawings—rough sketches—done from 
memory? If I remember rightly, the main wall is bastioned and 
the forts are said to be of the Montalembert type; is that so, and 
how many of them are there? You can use any military 
engineering terms, since I have some quite passable manuals and 
drawings here. Do you know details of any other Prussian 
fortresses? I am fairly familiar with Coblenz (Ehrenbrei tstein, at 
least),  and have seen a plan of Mainz. What interests me 
particularly is the manner in which the new Montalembert 
structures are built in Germany; it's impossible to find out 
anything about this owing to Prussian secretiveness.

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 375 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London, 17 April 1853] 
... Today I have received the first 5 numbers" from New York, 
whether from Weydemeyer or from Kellner I do not know. With 
most of them I was already familiar through you. This is at least a 
decent paper—a rare thing in America—and a working man's 
paper. However, I cannot say I very much care for the chief 
editor's affected effusions concerning 'questions personnelles' which 
are at one and the same time party questions, or for his 
pseudo-naive gentility and biblical portentousness. But you have to 
take this newspaper as it comes. What I liked best of all was 
Weydemeyer's introduction to his 'Ökonomische Skizzen'. Good 
stuff that. I have approached our people here; Dronke and Pieper 
have,  I think, already sent something. I shall speak to Jones. On 
the whole it is difficult to get contributions. I myself have too 
much to do. The others unfortunately are still somewhat put off 
by their earlier experiences. Lupus is in a wretched state. Eccarius 
has to work away at his tailoring from 5 in the morning until 8 at 
night and is in a dangerously hectic condition. Engels, when not 
stuck in the office, is completely taken up with his studies, and 
probably he too has not yet got over the wrongs he thinks he has 
suffered at the hands of the American Press. Our party is, alas, 
very pauvre. b I shall also approach ex-lieutenant Steffen, ex-witness 
for the defence at the Cologne trial, presently a schoolmaster in 
the vicinity of London. He has more spare time than anyone else 
and is very capable. 
Pieper has still not finished the articles you want, which explains 
why you haven't yet had them. 376 
As for the Hirsch affair/ a statement 11 IMMEDIATELY went off to 
Engels via Engels, which, etc., etc. I've known for 6 months or 
more that there was something fishy about Bangya. I didn't break 
with the fellow until, like the jackass he is, he had let me find out 
all about his connections, handed over all documents that put me

in the right and him in the wrong, and generally placed himself at 
my mercy. I threw him out months ago at Szemere's. 
My suspicions of Willich have only been confirmed by his latest 
step.  D'abord, 3 I know that he and Kinkel paid and continue to pay 
Hirsch out of revolutionary funds! Then, at the Cologne trial, 
soon after it began, he boasted to Fleury (who in turn passed it on 
to Imandt) that he had in his possession a letter of mine to Bangya 
dated Manchester. I challenged Bangya about this at the time. He 
said he was willing to be confronted with Fleury. On being 
informed of this by Imandt at my behest, Fleury retracted. Thus 
at that time Willich was illicitly consorting with Hirsch. He knew 
that Hirsch was illicitly consorting with Greif and that his friend 
Fleury was a spy. It was through these fellows that he got hold of 
my letter. The 'gallant worthy'—for whom, en passant? free meat 
and drink is le dernier but c—wanted to set a trap for me, and to 
that end became embroiled in intrigues with mouchards. 6 
True,  he sent Hirsch to Cologne. True, I heard later that 
Hirsch was in Cologne. But why did he send Hirsch to Cologne, 
and when did he send him there? Firstly, when it was already too 
late. 2. When the police in Cologne had themselves denounced his 
friend Fleury. 3. When he  himself,  having become suspect, wished 
to rehabilitate himself as a 'magnanimous worthy' by means of this 
theatrical coup. This was Hirsch's own account of the affair on his 
return... 
Reichenbach and family, 'clever' Lieutenant Schimmelpfennig 
complete with wife and Brüningk legacy of £1,000, and lastly, the 
artist Schmölze, set sail today for America. Bon voyage! But 
Reichenbach's flight has deprived poor Lupus of the last of his 
lessons. It's most unfortunate for' him. He's no Kinkel. Nor does 
he know how to lick the boots of the bourgeois like the future 
'President of the German Republic' and his 'consort', e both of 
them consummate sycophants, humbugs and parasites. The 
amiable Gottfried has so far succeeded in ingratiating himself that 
he has been accorded the use of one of London University's 
lecture rooms to repeat before a London audience his old series of 
lectures on Christian art in the Middle Ages. He is giving them 
free and gratis in the hope that he will be able to worm his way 
into the post of Professor of Aesthetics at London University. He 
delivers them in ABOMINABLE English, reading from a manuscript.

subsequently proved such a complete failure that not even the 
organised claque of Jewish aesthetics-mongers could save him. 
Edgar Bauer, who was present— Kinkel gave his first lecture last 
Tuesday—told me all about it. It seems to have been a truly 
nauseating and wretched performance.

[London,]  26 April  1853 
DEAR  Frederic, 
I fear that nothing will come  of my  proposed trip. a Bamberger 
cannot discount  the  bill  for me and  Friedländer,  who half-
promised  to do so, has now  definitely refused.  I have written  to 
Strohn about it, S79 but  look  on this  as a  mere formality which  I 
complied with pour acquit  de conscience^  and for my  wife's sake, 
without expecting anything  to come  of it. 
A paper  of mine  for the  Tribune (which included  the  first 
Turkish article)0 about Mazzini's presence here—again denied  by 
his friends  but on his  orders,  I think—was made  the  basis  for a 
short LEADER  on Mazzini's lucky escape, followed  by the  comment: 
* "In this connection  we may  properly  pay a  tribute  to the  remarkable ability  of 
the correspondent  by whom this interesting piece  of intelligence  is furnished.  Mr 
Marx  has  very decided opinions  of his own,  with some  of which  we are far  from 
agreeing,  but  those  who do not  read  his letters neglect  one of the  most instructive 
sources  of information  on the  great questions  of current European politics.'*d 
As you see, I am  firmly  in the  saddle.  I have  in addition  had a 
most interesting letter from Cluss with  2 issues containing Hirsch's 
confessions'*  (not yet  concluded).  I'm not  sending  the stuff  yet since 
there's still  a chance that something might happen  to enable  me to 
come myself  and  bring  the  things with  me.  Anyhow,  I won't come 
without notifying  you  beforehand. When  is your  old man  arriving? 
I'd rather  not  cannon into  him. 
If only Dana would advise  me of a  business house here,  as I 
have asked  him  three times  to do, I  should  at least  be over  the 
worst.

[London, 26 April 1853] 
Dear Cluss, 
You must by now have received three letters from me.381 
Enclosed a Jones Paper, containing an anti- Times article by 
'Englishman'.3 
If the Cologne Revelations have not yet been printed as a 
pamphlet, or 'gratis' as such by the Neu-England-Zeitung, do 
nothing more about it, as it is now too late. 
Willich has written to Herzen (the Russian) to say that 
everything is going 'splendidly', that he has achieved 'great results' 
and will soon be returning. 
Mr Hentze, for one, is again implicated in the Berlin business.1' 
In any case, as Willich-Kinkel's agent, he would have been possessed 
of old proclamations and revolutionary recipes. Furthermore, 
he was destined by these great men to be military commander of 
Berlin. 
The local Rollinists' are blushing for shame over Ruge's 
proclamation of which they were informed by us. In no case had 
Ledru given Ruge permission to publish this discreditable letter. 
Ruge extorted the letter from Ledru through the latter's 
ex-servant, the ex-Palatinate lawyer, and ex-French deputy, 
Savoye—one-time pedlar of German adjectival82 At all events, 
Ledru has sunk lower than ever before.

Dear Weydemeyer, 
On 21 April I received the anonymous scrawl set out  below.  An 
identical anonymous letter was sent to the democratic tavern-
keepers, Schärttner and Göringer. / have ASCERTAINED the facts 
contained therein. I think you should publish the thing (you 
may name Schärttner and Göringer) along with a few introduc­
tory remarks dated London. Messrs Stieber and Goldheim have 
come over here in order to Hink' Kossuth's apocryphal gunpowder 
plot with the Berlin affair. 3 From the following you will note 
to what extent the 'contrite' Hirsch continues to be 'A Victim of 
Moucharderie'. b Let us hope the blackguard doesn't succeed in 
finding fresh victims in Berlin. I think this business will prove his 
complete undoing in America. Cluss will have received what 
follows below at the same time as  yourself.  We were all very

figures for American exports are as follows: from 1 September to 
6 April of each year. 
1853 1852 1851 1850 
To England  1,100,000  930,000 757,000 592,000 
" France 257,000 302,000 246,000 192,000 
All other countries 204,000 189,000 163,000 105,000 
In other words, France is the only country which, despite the 
enormous American crop, has taken less than last year and barely 
more than in 1851, the year of political gloom, où l'ordre et la société 
allaient s'engloutir dans le gouffre socialiste? Imports in 1852 show 
the momentarily magical effect of the coup d'état, 1853 shows the 
reverse. Something was still being shipped from Liverpool to Havre, 
but not as much as formerly. In other respects too, industry 
in France would not appear to be exactly flourishing. This time 
the thing seems to be really serious, and connected especially with 
the ousting of French articles from foreign markets by domestic 
manufactures. The colossal proscriptions of workers in 1851/52 
are beginning to bear fruit; I am convinced that they have 
contributed quite specifically to the expansion and improvement 
of the English and American factories producing Paris articles, 
bronzes, etc. Today it is a thousand times more difficult than 
before to drive the proletariat across the border with impunity on 
the pretext of order. Even if there were complete peace, French 
industry would inevitably go to the dogs owing to this perpetual 
exploitation of conspiracy as a moyen de gouvernement? and the 
constantly renewed proscription of the proletariat; the English and 
the Yankees certainly know how to take advantage of the more 
useful amongst these. 
When, then, will you be coming?

get it cashed for you by a Yankee or at any rate advance you £10 
against it pending receipt of the balance—i.e., you can't have the 
money before 1 May, but on 2 May you will receive the £10 
without fail. Write and tell me whether in these circumstances you 
will be able to come here, and do come if at all possible; then you 
can send the money to your wife  yourself. 
At any rate, keep me informed, so that I'm  NOT  OUT  OF THE  WAY

Weydemeyer and  yourself, 1 which I shall send at the beginning of 
next week so that you and the others can make use of them; I

Freiligrath will, perhaps, be so good as to notify Weydemeyer or 
Lièvre of the receipt of the £25 enclosed herewith, 384 it being too 
late for me to write to Weydemeyer today. But how the fellows 
have managed to convert $125 into £25 is a mystery to me, for 
according to the last New York rate of 4 May sterling was standing 
at 54d. = 109s/4 cents, thus, even at 110 cents, $125=£25. lis.

Dear Marx, 
So the bomb is at long last about to go off, as you will see from 
the enclosed scrappy  proofd  and Weydemeyer's letter. Willich's 
manner of extricating himself is strange, at any rate; you will 
undoubtedly be much amused by these lame circumlocutions and 
the awkward and embarrassed style. The fellow's been hard hit.

Cincinnati; all grist to the mill. One thing we may be sure of is 
that the only effect of this statement will be to compromise the 
chivalrous one even more. 
So just because the New-Yorker-Criminal ZeitunglUU has published 
attacks upon him, the gallant Willich feels compelled to break his 
heroic silence. 
'Putting the case at its highest*!' In Willich's case bodies do not 
fall downwards but upwards! Good-bye to gravity! The fellow's 
quite mad. The same old tale of assassination too! We shall now 
see the aforesaid Schramm leap promptly into the lists, statement 
in hand.388 
To put your mind at rest, I can inform you that the 
Neu-England-Ztg. today advised me of the dispatch of 420 copies 
of Revelationsh to my address, so they may be here tomorrow or, if 
the parcel didn't go off by the last STEAMER, in a week at the most. 
The fellows have the effrontery to send me a letter signed 
semi-anonymously 'Office of the N.-E.-Z.' inviting me to contrib­
ute. That's the last straw! 
At all events, it's a good thing that we now possess in the 
Reform*89  an organ in which, if the worst comes to the worst, we 
can still make ourselves heard in the polemic against Willich and 
Co. As a result of the rumpus, Kellner is becoming more and 
more embroiled. 
Weydemeyer's misprint shouldn't surprise you. After all, you 
must know that when Weydemeyer does something, it is always 
'similar' rather than 'glorious'.' 
The little fellowd is coming here next Sunday. I am curious to 
see how he is shaping as a clerk in Bradford. At all events the 
good Buckup seems to be working him very hard. 
Yesterday I read the book on Arabian inscriptions which I told 
you about. 90  The thing is not without interest, repulsive though it 
is to find the parson and biblical apologist forever peeping 
through. His greatest triumph is to show that Gibbon made some 
mistakes in the field of ancient geography, from which he also 
concludes that Gibbon's theology was deplorable. The thing is 
called The Historical Geography of Arabia, by the Reverend Charles 
Forster. The best things to emerge from it are: 
1. The supposed genealogy of Noah, Abraham, etc., to be 
found in Genesis is a fairly accurate enumeration of the Beduin

tribes of the time, according to the degree of their dialectal 
relationships, etc. As we all know, Beduin tribes continue to this 
day to call themselves Beni Saled, Beni  Yusuf,  etc., i.e. sons of so 
and so. This nomenclature, which owes its origins to the early 
patriarchal mode of existence, ultimately leads up to this type of 
genealogy. The enumeration in Genesis is plus ou moins* con­
firmed by ancient geographers, while more recent travellers have 
shown that most of the old names still exist, though in dialectally 
altered form. But from this it emerges that the Jews themselves 
were no more than a small Beduin tribe like the others, which was 
brought into conflict with the other Beduins by local conditions, 
agriculture, etc. 
2. As for the great Arab invasion, you will remember our 
discussion when we concluded that, like the Mongols, the Beduins 
carried out periodic invasions and that the Assyrian and Babylo­
nian Empires were founded by Beduin tribes on the very same 
spot as, later, the Caliphate of Baghdad. The founders of the 
Babylonian Empire, the Chaldeans, still exist under the same 
name, Beni Chaled, and in the same locality. The rapid 
construction of large cities, such as Nineveh and Babylon, 
happened in just the same way as the creation in India only 300 
years ago of similar giant cities, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Muttan, by 
the Afghan and/or Tartar invasions. In this way the Mohammedan 
invasion loses much of its distinctive character. 
3. In the South-West, where the Arabs settled, they appear to 
have been a civilised people like the Egyptians, Assyrians, etc., as is 
evident from their buildings. This also explains many things about 
the Mohammedan invasion. So far as the religious fraud is 
concerned, the ancient inscriptions in the South, in which the 
ancient Arab national tradition of monotheism (as with the 
American Indians) still predominates, a tradition of which the 
Hebrew is only a small part, would seem to indicate that 
Mohammed's religious revolution, like every religious movement, 
was formally a reaction, a would-be return to what was old and 
simple. 
It is now quite clear to me that the Jews' so-called Holy Writ is 
nothing more than a record of ancient Arab religious and tribal 
traditions, modified by the Jews' early separation from their 
tribally related but nomadic neighbours. The circumstance of 
Palestine's being surrounded on the Arabian side by nothing but 
desert, i.e. the land of the Beduins, explains its separate 
a more or less

development. But the ancient Arabian inscriptions and traditions 
and the Koran, as well as the ease with which all genealogies, etc., 
can now be unravelled, show that the main content was Arab, or 
rather, generally Semitic, as in our case the Eddasgi and the 
German heroic saga.

The little manc was here on Saturday and seems to be making 
out better than was to be expected. Buckup told Strohn that he 
was quite satisfied with him and that he had quickly familiarised 
himself with the work. I gave him a little sermon about 
punctuality; anyhow, conditions at Buckup's office are as favour­

he continues to do well for 3 or 4 months, will have a secure berth.

DEAR  Frederic, 
The first half of the £20 note has turned up. I am writing this 
before going to the Museum,3 i.e. at a very early hour. 
I would have sent you long ago the enclosed great Willich's 
statement to the Neu-England-Zeitungb  had I not assumed that 
you'd had the thing from Weydemeyer. In conception this second 
statement is pure, GENUINE Willich. Others write 'essays', he writes 
'facts', 392 and only if one has been on a 'personal footing' with him 
does the calumny lose its sting. It is the manoeuvre of your petty 
partisan. He does not answer for his own Hirsch.' Rather, he 
explains to the public Marx's 'motives' for not refuting his Hirsch. 
And now he has discovered a terrain where he can operate with a 
measure of virtuosity. And it is with 'reluctance' that the noble man 
reveals the facts to the 'public'. Needless to say, he has preferred to 
whisper them to the philistines in the privacy of the beer-parlour 
a The library of the British Museum. - b  A. Willich, 'An die Redaktion der 
Neu-England-Zeittmg, Louisville, den 2. Mai 1853',  Neu-England-Zeitung, No. 62, 13 
May 1853. - c An allusion to Willich's help in publishing Hirsch's 'Die Opfer der 
Moucharderie...' (For details see K. Marx, 'The Knight of the Noble Conscious­
ness',  present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 481 and 498-99).

and, for the past three years, to peddle them 'contraband-wise' 
throughout two hemispheres, juvante Kinkelio? Then his man­
oeuvring to keep the public on tenterhooks. They forget the facts 
among which he twists and turns and eagerly await the facts which 
are to demolish the 'critical authors'. And the noble man is 
'distinguished' withal, as befits a 'public figure'. When he does 
reply, it will not be to Marx's uncouth 'agents' but to the 
'ingenious' quill-pushers themselves. Finally, he gives the public to 
understand that what makes his opponents so cocksure is their 
belief in his 'decision' to retire and, with a roll of drums, this 
important personage proceeds to announce that he has 'changed' 
his mind. 
Tout ça n'est pas trop mal pour un vieux sous-lieutenant!' But as for 
the style of statement No. 2—bad as it is, it is nevertheless 
apocryphal. Other hands have been at work on it, probably those 
of Madame Anneke. At all events, the necessary supplement to 
Tellering's pamphlet will now be published by Mr Willich c and, 
the dirty business having been once placed before the public, il 
faut aller jusqu'au bout? If Weydemeyer, Cluss and Co. operate with 
skill, they should now be able to put a spoke in Willich's wheel and 
ruin the impact and novelty of the surprises he is holding in store 
for the public. Nous verrons." 
The praise you accord to my 'budding' English,' I find most 
encouraging. What I chiefly lack is first, assurance as to grammar 
and secondly, skill in using various secondary idioms which alone 
enable one to write with any pungency. Mr Tribune has given 
special prominence to a note about my 2nd article on Gladstone's 
Budget,8 drawing the attention of readers to my  MASTERLY  EXPOSITION' 
and going on to say that NOWHERE have they seen  A MORE  ABLE  CRITICISM' 
and do NOT EXPECT TO SEE ONE.11 Well, that is ALL RIGHT. But in the 
following article it proceeds to make an ass of me by printing 
under my name a heading of mine1 which is quite trifling and 
intentionally so, whereas it appropriates your 'Swiss' thing.' I 
shall write and tell Dana that, 'flattering' though it may be if they

As regards the Hebrews and Arabs,d I found yor letter most 
interesting. It can, by the by, be shown that 1. in the case of all 
eastern tribes there has been, since the dawn of history, a general 
relationship between the  SETTLEMENT  of one section and the 
continued nomadism of the others. 2. In Mohammed's time the 
trade route from Europe to Asia underwent considerable modifi­
cation, and the cities of Arabia, which had had a large share of the 
trade with India, etc., suffered a commercial decline—a fact which 
at all events contributed to the process. 3. So far as religion is 
concerned, the question may be reduced to a general and hence 
easily answerable one: Why does the history of the East appear as 
a history of religions? 
On the subject of the growth of eastern cities one could hardly 
find anything more brilliant, comprehensive or striking than 
Voyages contenant la description des états du Grand Mogol, etc. by old 
François Bernier (for 9 years Aurangzeb's physician). He provides 
in addition a very nice account of military organisation and the 
manner in which these large armies fed themselves, etc. Concern­
ing both these he remarks inter alia: 
'The main body consists of cavalry, the infantry not being so numerous as is 
commonly supposed si ce n'est qu'avec les véritables gens de guerre, on ne confond 
tous ces gens de service et de bazars ou marchés qui suivent l'armée; car, en ce 
cas-là, je croirais bien qu'ils auraient raison dé mettre les 2 et 300 000 hommes 
dans l'armée seule qui est avec le roi, et quelquefois encore davantage, comme 
quand on est assuré qu'il sera longtemps absent de la ville capitale; ce qui ne 
semblera pas si fort étonnant à qui saura l'étrange embarras de tentes, de cuisines, 
de hardes, de meubles et de femmes même assez souvent, et par conséquent 
d'éléphans, de chameaux, de boeufs, de chevaux, de portefaix, de fourrageurs, 
vivandiers, marchands de toutes sortes et de serviteurs qui traînent après soi ces

armées, et à qui saura l'état et gouvernement particulier du pays, à savoir que le roi 
est le seul et unique propriétaire de toutes les terres du royaume, d'où vient par une 
certaine suite nécessaire que toute une ville capitale comme Delhi ou Agra ne vit 
presque que de la milice, et est par conséquent obligée de suivre le roi quand il va 
en campagne pour quelque temps, ces villes-là n'étant ni ne pouvant être rien 
moins qu'un Paris, mais n'étant proprement qu'un camp d'armée un peu mieux et plus 
commodément placé qu'en rase campagne.' 2 
In reference to the Grand Mogul's march on Kashmir, with an 
army 400,000 strong, he writes: 
'La difficulté est de savoir d'où et comment peut subsister une si grande armée 
en campagne, une si grande quantité d'hommes et d'animaux. Il ne faut pour cela 
que supposer, ce qui est très vrai, que les Indiens sont fort sobres et fort simples 
dans leur manger, et que de tout ce grand nombre de cavaliers il n'y a pas la 
dixième, ni même la vingtième partie, qui, dans la marche, mange de la viande; 
pourvu qu'ils aient leur kicheris ou mélange de riz et d'autres légumes, sur lesquels 
ils versent du beurre roux quand ils sont cuits, ils sont contents. Il faut encore 
savoir que les chameaux résistent extrêmement au travail, à la faim et à la  soif, 
vivent de peu et mangent de tout, et qu'aussitôt que l'armée est arrivée, les 
chameliers les mènent brouter à la campagne, où ils mangent tout ce qu'ils 
attrapent; de plus que les mêmes marchands qui entretiennent les bazars dans 
Delhi, sont obligés de les entretenir dans les campagnes, ebenso die petits 
marchands etc. ... enfin à l'égard du fourrage, tous ces pauvres gens s'en vont 
rôdant de tous les côtés dans les villages pour en acheter et y gagner quelque 
chose, et que leur grand et ordinaire refuge est de râper, avec une espèce de 
truelle, les campagnes entières, battre ou laver cette petite herbe qu'ils ont râpée, et 
l'apporter vendre à l'armée...' 
Bernier rightly sees all the manifestations of the East—he 
mentions Turkey, Persia and Hindustan—as having a common 
a 'unless all those serving-people and bazaar or market folk who follow the army 
are taken for true warriors; for, if such were the case, there would, I think, be 
good reason to put at 2 to 300,000 men the strength of that army alone that is with 
the king, and sometimes even more, as, for example, when it is known that he will 
be long absent from the capital city; which would not, indeed, seem so very 
surprising to anyone familiar with all the strange impedimenta of tents, kitchen, 
clothing, furniture, and even women quite often, and, consequently, elephants, 
camels, oxen, horses, porters, foragers, sutlers, merchants of all kinds and servants 
who follow in the wake of these armies, nor to anyone familiar with the conditions 
and government peculiar to the country, namely that the king is the sole and unique 
proprietor of all the lands in the kingdom, whence it necessarily follows that every 
capital city, such as Delhi or Agra, fixes almost wholly on the militia and is therefore 
obliged to follow the king whenever he goes campaigning for a time, these cities 
neither being, nor indeed able to be, in any respect a Paris, but being really nothing 
but an army encampment rather better and more commodiously situated than if it 
were in the open country.' (Marx's italics.) - b 'How and upon what so great an 
army can subsist in the field, or so large a concourse of men and animals, is 
difficult to conceive. To that end one can only surmise, and such is indeed the case, 
that the Indians are very sober and very simple in what they eat and that, of this

basis,  namely the  absence  of private landed  property.  This is the real 
clef,3  even to the eastern heaven. 
It would seem to be no go with Borchardt394 ; nevertheless I 
think the fellow might be prepared to try and obtain recommen­
dations for Lupus from Steinthal, etc., to London merchants. So 
much, at least, you could compel him to do, and it would mean a 
great deal to Lupus. 
What do you think about the failure of the hudibrastic 
Rodolphob  Gladstone's  'FINANCIAL SCHEME  FOR  REDUCING  THE  NATIONAL 
DEBT'? 1 
The day before yesterday the Journal des Débats revealed the 
true secret of Russia's impudence. The Continent, it says, must 
either expose its independence to danger from Russia, or it must 
expose itself to war, and that is 'la révolution  sociale'.  What the 
wretched Débats forgets, however, is that Russia is no less afraid of 
revolution than Mr Bertin, and that the whole question now is 
who can most convincingly simulate 'non-fear'. But England and 
France—the official ones—are so abject that Nicholas, if he sticks 
to his guns, will be able to do what he likes.

camp,  the  camel-drivers lead them  out to graze  in the countryside, where they  eat 
everything that comes their  way;  further, that  the  same merchants that keep  the 
bazaars  in Delhi  are  obliged  to keep them  in the  field also, likewise  the  lesser 
merchants,  etc.  ... finally, concerning forage,  all  these poor people  go  roving  in

ENGELS TO MARX 338 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 6 June [1853,] evening 
Dear Marx, 
I had intended to write to you by the first post today, but was 
detained at the office until 8 o'clock. You will have received both 
Weydemeyer's and Cluss' anti-Willich statements in the Criminal 
Zeitung'' i.e. direct from America. If not, write to me at once. As 
usual, papa Weydemeyer is too long-winded, very seldom makes a 
point, then promptly blunts it with his style, and unfolds his 
well-known lack of verve with rare composure. Nevertheless, the 
man has done his best, the story about Hentze, the 'comrade-in­
arms',  and the influence of others on Hirsch's pen is nicely 
fashioned; his incredible style and his composure, regarded over 
there as impassibility, will appeal to the philistines, and his 
performance can, on the whole, be regarded as satisfactory. Cluss' 
statement, on the other hand, pleases me enormously. In every 
line we hear the chuckle of l'homme supérieur 1 who, through 
'personal contact' with Willich, has, as it were, become physically 
a Roesgen - h  J. Weydemeyer, 'Weiters in der Willich-Hirsch'schen Angelegenheit';

und New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung, No. 10, 20 May 1853. - ' the superior man

conscious of his superiority. For lightness of style, this surpasses 
everything that Cluss has ever written. Never a clumsy turn of 
phrase, not a trace of gêne 3 or embarrassment. How well it 
becomes him thus to ape the worthy citizen of benevolent mien 
who nevertheless betrays the cloven hoof at every turn. How 
splendid, the sentence about 'revolutionary agencies' being 'a 
swindle' off which, according to Willich, he lives. The chivalrous 
one will have been surprised to find among the uncouth 'agents' 395 
a fellow who is so dashing, so adroit, so aggressive by nature and 
yet so unassumingly noble in his bearing, and who returns thrust 
for thrust a tempo so subtly—far more subtly and deftly than 
himself.  If only Willich had the discernment to discover this! But 
irritation and due reflection will, I trust, give him a little more 
insight. 
It is obvious that we shall have to see this dirty business through 
to the bitter end. The more resolutely we tackle it the better. 
You'll find, by the way, that it won't be so bad after all. The 
chivalrous one has promised vastly more than he can fulfil. We 
shall hear of assassination attempts, etc., the Schramm affair will 
be glamorously tricked out,' and such chimeras will be evoked as 
will cause us to stare at one another in amazement, not having the 
faintest idea what the man is actually talking about; at worst he 
will tell the story about Marx and Engels arriving drunk one 
evening at Great Windmill Street 24 (vide Kinkel in Cincinnati, 
coram Huzelio d). If he goes as far as that, I shall tell the 
scandal-loving American public what the Besançon Company 39fi 
used to talk about when Willich and the formosus c pastor Corydon 
Rauf  were not present. Au bout du compte? what can a brute of this 
kind find to tax us with? Mark my word, it will be just as pauvre" as 
Tellering's smear.' 
I shall be seeing Borchardt within the next few days. If any 
recommendations are to be had, you can trust me to get themJ 
But I hardly imagine that Steinthal, etc., have connections of the 
sort in London. It's almost .wholly outside their line of business. 
Besides, if only for fear of making a fool of  himself,  the fellow will 
attempt to put off doing anything about it up here. If it were not 
for Lupus, I'd consign the chap, etc. I can't abide him, with his

smooth, self-important, vainglorious, deceitful charlatan's physiog­
nomy. 
If Lassalle has given you a good, neutral address in Düsseldorf, 
you can send me 100 copies. 3 We shall arrange for them to be 
packed in bales of twist by firms up here; but they should not be 
addressed to Lassalle  himself,  since the packages will go to 
Gladbach, Elberfeld and so on, where they will have to be stamped 
and sent by post to Düsseldorf. However, we cannot entrust a 
package for Lassalle or the Hatzfeldt woman to any local firm, 
because, 1. they all employ at least one Rhinelander who knows all 
the gossip, or 2. if that goes off all right, the recipients of the bales 
will get to know about it, or 3. at the very best the postal 
authorities will take a look at the things before delivering them. 
We have a good address in Cologne, but are not, alas, very well 
acquainted with the people who are the principal buyers here for 
the firm in Cologne, and hence cannot expect them to do any 
smuggling. Indeed, what we shall tell the people here is that the 
packages contain presents for the fair sex. 
From all this you will gather that I am once again on passable 
terms with Charles.b The affair was settled with great dispatch at 
the first suitable opportunity. Nevertheless you will realise that the 
fool derives a certain pleasure from having been given preference 
over myself in one rotten respect at least, because of Mr Gottfried 
Ermen's envy of my old man. Habeat sibi.c  He at any rate realises 
that if I so choose, I can become maître de la situation'' within 48 
hours,  and that's sufficient. 
The absence of landed property is indeed the key to the whole 
of the East.397 Therein lies its political and religious history. But 
how to explain the fact that orientals never reached the stage of 
landed property, not even the feudal kind? This is, I think, largely 
due to the climate, combined with the nature of the land, more 
especially the great stretches of desert extending from the Sahara 
right across Arabia, Persia, India and Tartary ,9  to the highest of 
the Asiatic uplands. Here artificial irrigation is the first prerequi­
site for agriculture, and this is the responsibility either of the 
communes, the provinces or the central government. In the East, 
the government has always consisted of 3 departments only: 
Finance (pillage at home), War (pillage at home and abroad), and 
travaux publics,'' provision for reproduction. The British govern-

ment in India has put a somewhat narrower interpretation on 
nos. 1 and 2 while completely neglecting no. 3, so that Indian 
agriculture is going to wrack and ruin. Free competition is proving 
an absolute fiasco there. The fact that the land was made fertile by 
artificial means and immediately ceased to be so when the conduits 
fell into disrepair, explains the otherwise curious circumstance that 
vast expanses are now arid wastes which once were magnificently 
cultivated (Palmyra, Petra, the ruins in the Yemen, any number of 
localities in Egypt, Persia, Hindustan); it explains the fact that one 
single war of devastation could depopulate and entirely strip a 
country of its civilisation for centuries to come. This, I believe, also 
accounts for the destruction of southern Arabian trade before 
Mohammed's time, a circumstance very rightly regarded by you as 
one of the mainsprings of the Mohammedan revolution. 3 I am not 
sufficiently well acquainted with the history of trade during the 
first six centuries A.D. to be able to judge to what extent general 
material conditions in the world made the trade route via Persia to 
the Black Sea and to Syria and Asia Minor via the Persian Gulf 
preferable to the Red Sea route. But one significant factor, at any 
rate,  must have been the relative safety of the caravans in the 
well-ordered Persian Empire under fjie Sassanids, whereas be­
tween 200 and 600 A.D. the Yemen was almost continuously being 
subjugated, overrun and pillaged by the Abyssinians. By the 
seventh century the cities of southern Arabia, still flourishing in 
Roman times, had become a veritable wilderness of ruins; in the 
course of 500 years what were purely mythical, legendary traditions 
regarding their origin had been appropriated by the neighbouring 
Beduins, (cf. the Koran and the Arab historian Novaïri), and the 
alphabet in which the local inscriptions had been written was 
almost wholly unknown although there was no other, so that de facto 
writing had fallen into oblivion. Things of this kind presuppose, 
not only a SUPERSEDING, probably due to general trading conditions, 
but outright violent destruction such as could only be explained by 
the Ethiopian invasion. The expulsion of the Abyssinians did not 
take place until about 40 years before Mohammed, and was plainly 
the first act of the Arabs' awakening national consciousness, which 
was further aroused by Persian invasions from the North 
penetrating almost as far as Mecca. I shall not be tackling the 
history of Mohammed himself for a few days yet; so far it seems 
to me to have the character of a Beduin reaction against the 
settled, albeit decadent urban fellaheen whose religion by then was 
a See this volume, p. 332.

also much debased, combining as it did a degenerate form of 
nature worship with a degenerate form of Judaism and Christ­
ianity. 
Old Bernier's  stuff a is really very fine. It's a real pleasure to get 
back to something written by a sensible, lucid old Frenchman who 
constantly hits the nail on the head sans avoir  l'air de s'en 
apercevoir! 1 
Since I am in any case tied up with the eastern mummery for 
some weeks, I have made use of the opportunity to learn Persian. 
I am put off Arabic, partly by my inborn hatred of Semitic 
languages, partly by the impossibility of getting anywhere, without 
considerable expenditure of time, in so extensive a language—one 
which has 4,000 roots and goes back over 2,000-3,000 years. By 
comparison, Persian is absolute child's play. Were it not for that 
damned Arabic alphabet in which every half dozen letters looks 
like every other half dozen and the vowels are not written, I would 
undertake to learn the entire grammar within 48 hours. This for 
the better encouragement of Pieper should he feel the urge to 
imitate me in this poor joke. I have set myself a maximum of 
three weeks for Persian, so if he stakes two months on it he'll best 
me anyway. What a pity Weitling can't speak Persian; he would 
then have his langue universelle toute trouvée' since it is, to my 
knowledge, the only language where 'me' and 'to me' are never at 
odds,  the dative and accusative always being the same. 399 
It is, by the way, rather pleasing to read dissolute old Hafiz in 
the original lan'guage, which sounds quite passable and, in his 
grammar,0  old Sir William Jones likes to cite as examples dubious 
Persian jokes, subsequently translated into Greek verse in his 
Commentariis poeseos asiaticae, because even in Latin they seem to 
him too obscene. These commentaries, Jones' Works, Vol. II, De 
poesi erotica, will amuse you. Persian prose, on the other hand, is 
deadly dull. E.g. the Rauzât-us-safâ by the noble Mirkhond, who 
recounts the Persian epic in very flowery but vacuous language. Of 
Alexander the Great, he says that the name Iskander, in the 
Ionian language, is Akshid Rus (like Iskander, a corrupt version of 
Alexandros); it means much the same as  filusuf,  which derives 
from fila, love, and sufa, wisdom, 'Iskander' thus being synonym­
ous with 'friend of wisdom'.

Of a RETIRED king he says: 'He beat the drum of abdication with 
the drumsticks of retirement', as will père Willich, should he 
involve himself any more deeply in the literary fray. Willich will 
also suffer the same fate as King Afrasiab of Turan when deserted 
by his troops and of whom Mirkhond says: 'He gnawed the nails 
of horror with the teeth of desperation until the blood of 
vanquished consciousness welled forth from the finger-tips of

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 9 June 1853 
Dear Marx, 
So that Pieper may see he hasn't been forgotten, inform him of 
the following. In yesterday's Manchester Guardian there was the 
offer of a post as CORRESPONDING CLERK AND BOOKKEEPER. He might 
contrive to get £180 a year; from what I hear, it is with a Jew 
here,  Leo Schuster. Pieper should at once write a letter addressed 
to: 
Box B 47, 
Post Office, 
Manchester 
and beginning: Monsieur, etc. 
The letter had best be written in French, since French and 
German are required. He should say he thinks he can fill the post, 
that he comes from Hanover, is aged such-and-such, and last 
worked for so-and-so in London, from whom inquiries may be 
made as to his character and qualifications. He can conduct 
correspondence in German, French and English and, if needs be, 
in Italian, is rather less familiar (if indeed this is the case) with

bookkeeping; he must say that he lost his post because the 
partner's son had joined, etc., then what sort of a business it was, 
but that he could without doubt quickly familiarise himself with all 
types of merchandise business in the Manchester TRADE. Le tout sans 
phrase, aussi simplement raconté que possible. 
J'ai l'honneur de me souscrire', 
or else, 'Mr., votre très dévoué', 3 etc. 
Nothing more. If they consider him, he will probably be 
summoned to Schuster's London house, and then it will be up to 
him. But he must write straight away, by the first post tomorrow. 
Herewith £1. 18. 6d., the balance of the £32. The fellow only 
deducted 18 pence for collecting charges but, on the other hand, 
all Charlesb and I owed him. 
You will have received the bill from America the day before 
yesterday. 
Whether Pieper can give Rothschild as a reference, you people 
in London will be best able to judge; if so, it might do no harm, 
for the fact that Pieper is no  BRED  CLERK  will emerge at the very first 
interview when they ask him where he worked before. But he 
must be sure of what Rothschild is going to say and, perhaps, see 
him beforehand.

MARX TO ENGELS 338 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 14 June 1853 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
Having been prevented by all sorts of business and domestic 
affairs, I have only today got round to replying to your two letters3 
and acknowledging receipt of the American money 
(handed over to Freiligrath),b likewise the balance of the American 
Tribune money. If that's the sort of business relationship you and 
Charlesc had with your 'intermediary', then you've been up to 
some trick for my sake. For since it was not that fellow, but you, 
who advanced the money against the bill, you and Charles could 
just as well have sent- the bill to America without the fellow. At 
least, that's how it seems to me. 
I did not inform Pieper of your news for the following reasons: 
Pieper was becoming more and more of a wreck and some 8 or 10 
days ago I took him to task about the state of his health. It then 
transpired that his illness was going de pis en pis 6 at the hands of 
his English quack. I therefore suggested I should take him straight 
to Bartholomew's Hospital — the London hospital at which the 
foremost and most renowned doctors treat the public for nothing. 
He came with me. An ancient Hippocrates, after examining the 
corpus delicti and questioning him about his former TREATMENT, told 
him: 'You  HAVE  BEEN  A FOOL',  explaining at the same time that he would 
be 'DOWN' within three months if he did not follow his instructions 
to the letter. The efficacy of the new treatment was immediately 
apparent and in 2 weeks the man will be sain et  sauf. c The case was 
too serious for the treatment to be interrupted, and anyhow 
Freiligrath has a post in view for Pieper. If nothing comes of it, I 
shall let you know. 
Rumpf,  our jolly tailor, is now shut up in a lunatic asylum. Some

carthorse. About a week since he took to drinking again, sent for 
me a couple of days ago, revealed that he had discovered the 
means of making the whole world happy, that I was to be his 
minister, etc., etc. He has been in the ASYLUM since yesterday. It's a 
pity about the fellow. 
In The Leader—which, by the by, has become a purely bourgeois 
sheet—Ruge has announced that he will be giving lectures on 
German philosophy in London.a  Needless to say he takes this 
opportunity to give himself a  puff.  E.g. 'Where style is concerned, 
there is only one man whom the German people set alongside 
him—Lessing.' In the same issue of The Leader, the Russian Herzen 
advertises his collected works b adding that, together with the 
Polish Committee, he is to set up a Russo-Polish propaganda press 
here in London.400 
One of the enclosed letters from Cluss401  will reveal to you the 
nature of the main blow with which Willich is threatening me. He 
refers to the £20 borrowed by me from the Refugee Committee at 
a time when I myself was distrained because my Chelsea 
landlady, 402 although I had paid her, had not paid her  LANDLORD,— 
a debt which I repaid down to the last farthing by the necessary 
INSTALMENTS.403  You must now advise me what tactics to adopt. If 
that's how the good Willich thinks he's going to do me in, he must 
be a regular 'bonhomme'. c 
Carey, the American political economist, has brought out a new 
book, Slavery at Home and  Abroad.  Here 'SLAVERY' covers all forms of 
servitude, WAGE-SLAVERY , etc. He has sent me his book in which he 
quotes me repeatedly (from the Tribune) now as 'A RECENT ENGLISH 
WRITER', now as  'CORRESPONDENCE  OF THE  NEW-YORK TRIBUNE?.404  AS I have 
told you before, this man, in his earlier works, propounds the 
'harmony' of the bourgeoisie's economic foundations and attri­
butes all MISCHIEF to unnecessary interference by the State. The 
State was his bête noire. He is now playing a different tune. All ills 
are blamed on the centralising effect of big industry. But this 
centralising effect is in turn blamed on England, who has made 
herself the WORKSHOP of the world and has forced all other countries 
to revert to brutish agriculture divorced from manufacturing. In 
its turn, responsibility for England's sins is laid on the theory of 
Ricardo-Malthus, and specially Ricardo's theory of rent. The 
necessary consequence both of Ricardo's theory and of industrial

centralisation would be communism. And to obviate all this, to 
counter centralisation with localisation and the union,—a union 
scattered throughout the land—of factory and farm, our ULTRA-
FREE-TRADER  finally recommends—protective tariffs. To obviate the 
effects of bourgeois industry, responsibility for which he lays on 
England, his recourse, as a genuine Yankee, is to speed up this 
process in America itself by artificial means. For the rest, his 
opposition to England drives him into Sismondian praise of the 
petty bourgeoisie in Switzerland, Germany, China, etc. And this is 
the chap who used to deride France for her resemblance to China. 
The only thing of definite interest in the book is the comparison 
between Negro slavery as formerly practised by the English in 
Jamaica and elsewhere, and Negro slavery in the United States. 
He demonstrates how the main STOCK of Negroes in Jamaica always 
consisted of freshly imported BARBARIANS, since their treatment by 
the English meant not only that the Negro population was not 
maintained, but also that 2/s of the yearly imports always went to 
waste, whereas the present generation of Negroes in America is a 
native product, more or less Yankeefied, English speaking, etc., 
and hence capable of being emancipated. 
The Tribune, needless to say, is puffing Carey's book for all it's 
worth.'" Both, indeed, have this in common, that, in the guise of 
Sismondian-philanthropic-socialist anti-industrialism, they repres­
ent the protectionist, i.e. industrial, bourgeoisie of America. That 
is also the key to the mystery why the Tribune, despite all its 'isms'b 
and socialist flourishes, manages to be the 'LEADING JOURNAL' in the 
United States. 
Your article on Switzerlandc was, of course, a direct swipe at the 
Tribune's 'LEADERS' (anti-centralisation, etc.) and their man Carey. I 
continued this clandestine campaign in my first article on India,d 
in which England's destruction of native industries is described as 
revolutionary. This they will find very SHOCKING. Incidentally the 
whole administration of India by the British was detestable and 
still remains so today. 
The stationary nature of this part of Asia, despite all the aimless 
activity on the political surface, can be completely explained by 
two mutually supporting circumstances: 1. The  PUBLIC  WORKS  system 
of the central government and, 2. Alongside this, the entire

Empire which, apart from a few large cities, is an agglomeration 
of VILLAGES,  each with its own distinct organisation and each 
forming its own small world. A parliamentary report described 
these  VILLAGES  as follows a: 
* 'A village, geographically considered,  is a  tract  of country comprising some 
100 or 1000  acres  of arable  and  waste lands: politically viewed,  it resembles  a 
corporation  or township. Every village  is, and  appears always  to have been,  in fact, 
a separate community  or republic. Officials:  1. the  Potail, Goud, Mundil  etc. as he 
is termed  in different languages,  is the  head inhabitant,  who has  generally  the 
superintendence  of the  affairs  of the  village, settles  the  disputes  of the  inhabitants, 
attends  to the  police,  and  performs  the  duty  of collecting  the  revenue within  the 
village...  2. The  Cumum, Shanboag,  or Putwaree,  is the  register.  3. The  Taliary  or 
Sthulwar  and 4. the  Totie,  are  severally  the  watchmen  of the  village  and of the 
crops.  5. the  Neerguntee distributes  the  water  of the  streams  or reservoirs  in just 
proportion  to the  several fields.  6. The  Joshee,  or astrologer, announces  the 
seed-times  and  harvests,  and the  lucky  or unlucky days  or hours  for all the 
operation  of farming.  7. The  smith,  and 8. the  carpenter frame  the  rude instruments 
of husbandry,  and the  ruder dwellings  of the  farmer.  9. The  potter fabricates  the 
only utensils  of the  village.  10. The  waterman keeps clean  the few  garments...  11. 
The barber,  12. the  silversmith,  who  often combines  the  function  of village poet  and 
schoolmaster. Then  the  Brahmin,  for  worship. Under this simple form  of municipal 
government  the  inhabitants  of the  country have lived from time immemorial.  The 
boundaries  of the  villages have been  but  seldom altered;  and  although  the  villages 
themselves have been sometimes injured,  and  even desolated  by war,  famine  and 
disease;  the  same name,  the  same limits,  the  same interests,  and  even  the  same 
families, have continued  for  ages.  The  inhabitants give themselves  no trouble about 
the breaking  up and  division  of kingdoms, while  the  village remains entire, they 
care not to  what power  it is  transferred,  or to  what sovereign  it devolves.  Its 
internal economy remains unchanged.'* 
The post of Potail is mostly hereditary. In some of these 
COMMUNITIES  the  LANDS  of the  VILLAGE CULTIVATED  IN COMMON,  in ITlOSt  of 
them  EACH OCCUPANT TILLS  HIS OWN  FIELD.  Within the same, slavery and 
the caste system.  WASTE LANDS FOR COMMON PASTURE.  Home-weaving and 
spinning by wives and daughters. These idyllic republics, of which 
only the  VILLAGE  boundaries are jealously guarded against neigh­
bouring  VILLAGES,  continue to exist in well-nigh  PERFECT  form in the 
NORTHWESTERN PARTS OF INDIA  only recently occupied by the English. No 
more solid basis for Asiatic despotism and stagnation is, I think, 
conceivable. And however much the English may have Irelandised 
the country, the breaking up of the archetypal forms was the 
conditio sine qua non for Europeanisation. The  TAX-GATHERER  alone 
could not have brought this about. Another essential factor was 
the destruction of the ancient industries, which robbed these 
villages of their  SELF SUPPORTING  character. 
a Marx quotes presumably from  the  Fifth Report from  the  Select Committee  on 
the Affairs  of the  East India Company,  1812.

In Bali, an island off the east coast of Java, this Hindu 
organisation still intact, alongside Hindu religion, its traces, like 
those of Hindu influence, discernible all over Java. So far as the 
property question is concerned, this is a great bone of contention 
among English writers on India. In the broken mountainous 
terrain south of the Kistna, however, there appears to have been 
property in land. In Java, on the other hand, as noted in the 
History of Java by a former English governor, Sir Stamford 
Raffles, the sovereign [was] absolute LANDLORD throughout the 
country  'WHERL RENT TO ANY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT WAS ATTAINABLE'. At all 
events, the Mohammedans seem to have been the first in the 
whole of Asia to have established the principle of 'no property in 
land'. 
Regarding the above-mentioned VILLAGES, I should note that they 
already feature in the Manu, 405 according to which the whole 
organisation rests on them. 10 are administered by a senior 
COLLECTOR, then 100, then  1,000.

169. Marx to Ciuss. About 14 June 1853 349 
In dealings with the Reform I would recommend, besides 
shrewdness, une modération extrême" This clever-clever philistine 1' 
who,  in Hesse — and Hesse was his world—represented nothing 
except the demiurge of this, his world: the petty bourgeois, and 
who now assumes the air of one who, from the very start, has 
represented the proletariat on a 'materialist basis'—this smiling 
nonentity who, with Solomon-like dicta, 'stresses' his shrewdness 
and remarkable composure vis-à-vis rebellious parties—this incar­
nation of a marginal gloss to 'Heise's articles'; this fellow, then, 
does not, of course, interest me—he repels me. But you people 
helped to make the paper. It appears in New York. 
Half Germany will come to New York for the Exhibition.128  You 
have no other paper in New York. Might it not, then, be impolitic 
to throw over Kellner and the paper? It would in the end be 
doing the fellows another favour. Pretend to be naive. Go on 
writing; you couldn't do him a worse turn. Do not emancipate him 
from influences which, as everything goes to show, have been 
damnably irksome to him. Do as the Prussian bourgeois do. The 
government and its Manteuffel twist and turn in vain to rid 
themselves of the friendship of those bourgeois. The latter, for 
their part, pretend to believe in the constitutionality of their 
government, and le gouvernement est constituonnel malgré lui-même': 
that's worldly wisdom for you. 
The Neu-England-Zeitung is equally unreliable and likely to 
remain so. Mr Schläger, a pedant replete with platitudes, a 
presumptious bore who always knows better (à la Kellner, 'le mieux 
est le plus grand ennemi du bien' à), has written to Pieper suggesting I 
write for the N.-E.-Z. about the necessary transition from the 
bourgeois to the communist mode of production. 
Citizen Marx with his 'schematising and organising' intellect 
would, it seems, be well suited to this task set him by Citizen 
Schläger, but Citizen Marx must 'forego his abstract language' and 
write in the same manner as all, etc. Worthy Citizen Schläger! In 
the same letter he enjoins Pieper on no account to attack Citizens 
Ruge and Heinzen (he regularly deletes such passages) since the 'élite 
of his readers' (just think what the others must be like!) are 
Heinzenites, and the N.-E.-Z. is destined (literally) to inherit the 
readers of the Janus. Mighty Citizen Schläger! Almighty Pompey! 
Nevertheless, I have advised Pieper to go on writing for Schläger.

Dear Engels, 
My sister0 and her newly wedded husbandd, who is sailing from 
here-  to the Cape of Good Hope as a GENERAL DEALER, have 
unexpectedly descended on me. This, combined with the work for 
the Tribune and some unpleasantness to be cleared up in America, 
has made considerable demands on my time. The couple set out 
tomorrow, I believe. I hear from Imandt that your mother is 
expected in London, from which I conclude that you, too, will 
turn up soon. 
Enclosed Lassalle's instructions for the dispatch of the copies6 to 
Germany. My wife will undertake their dispatch to Manchester. 
I hope that you people will then take care of the matter up 
there. Haven't you seen anything of Jones? He's roaming about in 
your part of the world and is said to have brought off a MONSTER 
MEETING in Halifax.408 
Last Wednesday, much to my astonishment, I received a very 
peevish letter from Cluss, in which he said someone had written 
telling him that Pieper had described him to Schläger —him and 
Arnold—as 'subordinate agents', and  himself,  on the contrary, as

there isn't a word of truth in the whole thing, which is merely an 
attempt by Willich, Anneke, Weitling and Co.'s party to sow 
dissension amongst our own ranks, and, more particularly, to

explanations were, of course, dispatched across the water at

Dear Marx, 
At four o'clock this morning my old landlady roused me from 
my slumbers saying there was a gentleman wanting to speak to 
me. Dragging myself out of bed, I went to the door where I found 
a little man with a  CAB,  a colossal trunk and a travelling bag, who 
told me his name was Jacobi and that you and Pieper had sent 
him to me. Marx and Pieper! I thought. Who the devil can this

Jacobi be? Is he the illegitimate son of one in Königsberg 3 or 
what? Until finally the little man pulled your letter b out of his 
pocket, somewhat taken aback at not being instantly welcomed 
with open arms, stranger though he was—whereupon it occurred 
to me that he was, as your letter confirmed, the communist trial 
Jacobi to whom I hadn't given a thought, believing him long since 
well and truly lodged in a Prussian prison cell. Que faire?" I took 
him in, together with his belongings and, drunk with sleep, 
chatted with him for half an hour before offering him my sofa to 
sleep on, for the house was CRAMMED FULL of people. Luckily my old 
man is out of town until tomorrow and so, this very morning, I 
took the good party martyr by the collar, engaged lodgings for 
him and forbade him to show his face here until my old man's 
departure raises the interdict. 
This warliked  Westphalian way of behaving, the doltishness 
of spending a whole week in London and then choosing a train 
that arrives in the middle of the night and, on the pretext of not 
knowing what's what, turning a man's house upside down and 
imposing  himself,  all this was no more calculated to predispose me 
in his favour than was the discreet question put to me at the very 
outset as to how I stood with my old man. Further exchanges have 
raised the fellow in my estimation a little, but not very much. He 
proposes to call on Borchardt with letters from you and Kinkel 
(almost beats Marx and Pieper), to burst in on little Heckscher 
without ceremony and without an introduction in the hope that 
the latter will immediately provide him with all possible informa­
tion about his TRADE and, for sheer joy at the prospect of fresh 
'scientific' intercourse, make half his practice over to his new 
competitor—and other such philistine conceits. His foolishness in 
going to Kinkel will do him more harm than good. Kinkel gives 
him letters not to Mr but to Mrs Schunck, a piece of effrontery 
which is also a gross and direct breach of English etiquette, and 
again, if Mr Kinkel, who was fed and paid cash for his buffooneries 
on German literature, if Monsieur Gottfried, I say, believes he can 
send letters of recommendation (other than fund-raising licences) 
d'égal à égal" to these merchants, he's damned well mistaken. Apart 
from that, Monsieur Jacobi, à ce qu'il me paraît,' is not the man to 
make his fortune here.

Dear Engels, 
The day before yesterday I got a letter from Lassalle, who is 
now in a state of suspense, imagining letters have been inter­
cepted, etc. It would have been good had you advised me whether 
or not the parcel had gone off to him. b Lassalle is still the only one 
who dares correspond with London, and we must therefore be 
careful not to put him off. So I would ask you to let me know 
what the position is about the parcel. The time of its dispatch is of 
importance to me in another way, i.e. because upon it depends the 
time of the RETURN.

In the debate on  ADVERTISEMENT  DUTY412—about  a fortnight ago, I

now have current bills  on America—two  of them—amounting  to 
£42 and yet  cannot command above  42 farthings, though having 
to provide means  of subsistence  not  [only]  for myself  but  also for 
Pieper.  The  first bill  of £24 I  gave  to Mr  Spielmann;  he told me 
to come back  in five weeks' time. That  was  seven weeks  ago. 
Besides, this wretched traipsing  to and  from  the  City invariably 
takes  up my  Mondays  and  Thursdays,  the  very days when  I have 
to be  preparing Tuesday's  and  Friday's articles. Each time 
Spielmann turns  me  away with  the  remark, uttered  in Jewishly 
nasal tones:  'Nah  nahtice  yet.' In the  case  of such 'small' amounts, 
he says,  his correspondents write only  at their convenience,  and, if 
I had  needed  the  money straight away,  I should have said 
beforehand that  I would  pay the  postage  for a  special letter,  etc., 
etc. This means daily unpleasantnesses,  not  only  for me but for 
my wife  who,  counting  on the  prompt arrival  of the  money,  had 
given definite promises  to sundry creditors,  and now the  curs  are 
laying siege  to the  house. Meanwhile,  I am  writing away like  the 
devil.  It would  be fine  if you  could send  me an  article  or two in 
between whiles, thus giving  me the  time  to write something better. 
U of my  time  is taken  up  chasing after PENNIES.

ENGELS TO MARX

[Manchester,] Wednesday, 24 August 1853 
Dear Marx, 
I'll send some money tomorrow if I possibly can. Your letter 
arrived on Saturday too late for anything to be done, this week 
there have been all sorts of complications, but tomorrow things 
will, I think, have improved, and our old bookkeeper has been 
forewarned. 
The little manh  was here on Saturday. That he had been 
gossiping was evident to me from the moment he wrote to 
Borchardt. He had sent him Lupus' most discreditable letter in 
which the latter makes an outright and most earnest appeal to the 
'generosity' of the Jews in Bradford.  C'était  une lettre à brûler de 
suite"; Borchardt at once magnanimously sent Lupus alms, to wit 
the sum of one pound,—not that he wasn't very decent about it, 
WHICH  HE COULD WELL AFFORD to be, seeing that it released him from all 
his obligations. I must confess that this letter of Lupus' left a very 
bad taste in my mouth, but not so bad as the little man's tactlessness 
in letting it fall into Borchardt's clutches. Anyway I duly hauled him 
over the coals for it.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 September 3 1853 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
I have not written to you for a long-time, even to acknowledge 
receipt of the £5 (of which £2.10 was paid to Pieper and £1.10 to 
Lupus), the reason being that a lot of indescribable muck has 
taken up MY TIME AND MY ENERGIES. On 7 July I gave my bill to 
Spielmann. b On 31 Augustc the lad told me—after I had been to 
see him 7 times—that the bill had got lost, that I must make out 
another one for him, etc. So I had managed for weeks by pawning 
everything, down to the last item, and had made a further 
appointment for 31 August0 with all my creditors whom I had 
been putting off since July. As I have no resources other than the 
income from the Tribune, you will understand my situation and 
that I have neither the time nor the inclination for correspon­
dence. 
Tell Jacobi, if he's still there, that I have written to 
Weydemeyer, etc., on his  behalf. 417 
My reason for writing to you today is the following: 
So far as I know you do not read The Morning Advertiser. This 
paper, which belongs to the 'UNITED VICTUALLERS', carried an apology 
of Bakunin by a 'FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT' (Mr Golovin, I think).rt  In the 
same Morning Advertiser an anonymous F. M. expressed suspicion 
that Bakunin was a Russian spy and doing very nicely, etc , etc.'' 
To this Golovin and Herzen replied, pointing out that this same 
calumny had already appeared in 1848 in a 'GERMAN PAPER', which 
PAPER 'HAD EVEN VENTURED TO APPEAL TO THE TESTIMONY OF  GEORGE SAND'/ 
Three days ago 'Dr Arnold Ruge' chipped in, remarking that 
this German paper was the New Rhenish Gazette 9 whose EDITOR, 'Dr

Marx',  had  known just  as well  as any  other democrat that these 
calumnies were false. 3 
In yesterday's Morning Advertiser  I published  a statement0  to the 
effect that: 
MESSRS  Golovin  AND  Herzen had  CHOSEN  TO CONNECT  THE  NEW RH. G. 
EDITED  BY ME  IN 1848  AND  >49 with their polemic with  F. M.  about 
Bakunin, etc. Now, I  CARE NOTHING ABOUT  THE  INSINUATIONS  OF  MESSRS 
Herzen  AND Golovin. But etc., etc.  'PERMIT ME  TO STATE  THE  FACTS  OF THE 
CASE'.  There follows  an  enumeration  of the  facts: 
'that  on 5  July 1848  we  received letters from Paris,  one  from  the 
Havas Bureau,  the  other from  a POLISH REFUGEE  (which  is what  I call 
Ewerbeck), both  STATING  that George Sand possesses letters com­
promising Bakunin AS  BEING LATELY ENTERED INTO RELATIONS WITH  THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT'; 
'that  on 6  July  we  published this letter,0  not the one  from  the 
Havas Bureau,  but  from  our  Paris correspondent'; 
'that Bakunin, replying  in the  Neue Oder-Zeitung, d prior  to our 
correspondence, states that similar rumours  had  been circulating 
in Breslau, that they emanated from  the  Russian embassies  and 
that he  could refute them  in no  better  way  than  by  appealing  to 
George Sand' 418; 
'that on 3  August Koscielski brought  to the  Rheinische Zeitung  a 
letter addressed  by  George Sand  to its  editor, which  was  published 
the same day 6 with  the  following introductory remarks':' (here 
follows  an  extract from  the  Neue Rheinische Zeitung 1); 
'that  at the end of  August  I passed through Berlin,  saw  Bakunin 
and renewed  my old  friendship with  him'; 
'that  on 15  October  (or  thereabouts)  the  Rheinische Zeitung stood 
up for  Bakunin against  the  Prussian ministry which  had  ordered 
his expulsion'  ; 
'that  in February  ('49) the  Rheinische Zeitung published  a LEADING

our friend!",' etc.';

'that in the New-York Tribune I  PAID BAKUNIN THE TRIBUTE DUE  TO HIM 
FOR HIS  PARTICIPATION  IN OUR  MOVEMENTS,'3  etC, etC. 
My statement concludes with  the  words: 
*'As to F. M.  proceeding  as he  does from  the  fixed idea that 
continental  revolutions  are fostering  the  secret plans  of Russia,  he 
must,  if he  pretends  to anything like consistency, condemn  not 
only Bakunin  but  every continental Revolutionist,  as a  Russian 
agent.  In his  eyes Revolution itself  is a  Russian agent.  Why not 
Bakunin?'* 
Well,  in today's  issue  the  blackguard Golovin does  not  dare give 
his name  but,  under  the  rubric 'FROM  A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT', 
publishes  the  following piece  in The  Morning Advertiser: 
* How to  Write Historyh 
(From  a Foreign Correspondent) 
Bakunin  is a  Russian agent—Bakunin  is not a  Russian agent. Bakunin died  in 
the prison  of Schlüsselburg, after having endured much ill-treatment—Bakunin  is 
not dead:  he still lives.  He is  made  a soldier,  and  sent  to the  Caucasus—no,  he is 
not made  a soldier:  he remains detained  in the  citadel  of St.  Peter  and St.  Paul. 
Such  are the  contradictory news which  the  press  has  given  in turn, concerning 
Michael Bakunin.  In these days  of extensive publicity  we only arrive  at the  true  by 
affirming  the  false;  but, has it at  least been proved that Bakunin  has not  been  in 
the military  pay of  Russia? 
There  are  people  who do not  know that humanity makes  men  mutually 
responsible—that  in  extricating Germany from  the  influence which Russia 
exercises over  it, we  re-act upon  the  latter country,  and  plunge  it anew into  its 
despotism, until  it becomes vulnerable  to revolution. Such people  it would  be idle 
to attempt  to persuade that Bakunin  is one of the  purest  and  most generous 
representatives  of progressive cosmopolitism. 
'Calumniate, calumniate,' says  a French proverb,  and  'something will always 
remain.'  The  calumny against Bakunin, countenanced  in 1848 by one of his 
friends,  has  been reproduced  in 1853 by an  unknown person.  'One is  never 
betrayed  but by  one's  own  connexion!, says another proverb:  'and it is  better  to deal 
with a wise enemy than with  a stupid friend.'  The  conservative journals have  not 
become  the  organ  of the  calumny insinuated against Bakunin.  A friendly journal 
undertook that care. 
Revolutionary feeling must  be but  slightly developed when  it can be  forgotten, 
as M. Marx  has  forgotten, that Bakunin  is not of the  stuff  of which police-spies  are 
made.  Why, at  least,  did he not, as is the  custom  of the  English papers,  why did he 
not simply publish  the  letter  of the  Polish refugee which denounced Bakunin?  He 
would have retained  the  regret  of seeing  his  name associated with  a false 
accusation.*

I intend to answer the chap as follows (see below) and would 
like you to return this to me promptly (by Monday if possible), with 
the style put to rights.419 
At the same time the point arises whether you and Dronke, as 
EDITORS of the New Rhenish Gazette, might not wish to make a 
statement. Clique versus clique. On the other side are only Ruge, 
Herzen and Golovin. Bakunin himself has dubbed the latter 'un 
polisson'.* One of Nicholas' most zealous admirers in 1843 and '44, 
he became a democrat because he believed he had become suspect, 
nor has he dared return to Russia. This last is the sum total of his 
heroism. 
I for my part suggest a statement, the substance of which would 
be as follows: 
* It is better to deal with a wise enemy, than with a stupid 
friend,' Bakunin would have exclaimed, if he was ever to read the 
letter of the 'foreign' Sancho Pansa who, in your Saturday's 
paper, b indulges in his proverbial commonplaces. 
Is he not a 'stupid friend' who reproaches me with not having 
done by what doing I would according to himself have 'retained 
the regret of seeing my name associated with a false accusation'? 
Is he not a 'stupid friend' who is astonished of what every 
schoolboy knows that truth is established by controversy and that 
historical facts are to be extricated from contradictory statements? 
When the N. Rh. G. brought the Paris letter Bakunin was at 
liberty. If he was right to be satisfied with the public explanations 
of the N. Rh. G. in 1848, c is it not a 'stupid friend' who pretends 
to find fault with them in 1853? If he was wrong in renewing his 
intimate relations with the Editor of the N. Rh. G., is it not 'stupid' 
on the part of a pretended friend to reveal his weakness to the 
public? 
Is he not a 'stupid friend' who thinks necessary to 'plunge 
Russia anew in its despotism' as if she had ever emerged from it? 
Is he not a 'stupid friend' who calls the Latin proverb 
'calumniare audacter'd a French proverb? 
Is he not a 'stupid friend' who cannot understand why the 
'conservative journals did not like to publish the calumnies' which 
were secretly spread against Bakunin throughout Germany while 
the most revolutionary paper of Germany was obliged to publish 
them?

Is he not a 'stupid friend' who ignores that 'revolutionary

beheaded the Dantons and the Desmoulins and the Anacharsis 
Cloots? 
Is he not a 'stupid friend' who dared not accuse The Morning 
Advertiser for having inserted the letter of F. M. while Bakunin is 
incarcerated at St. Petersburg at the same time accusing the 
N. Rh. G. for having inserted a similar letter in 1848 when Bakunin 
was free and not yet reduced to the misery of being defended by a 
'stupid friend'?

Dear Frederic, 
Your letter did, indeed, arrive too late.421 I condensed the  stuff 3 
by cutting out unnecessary pathos, tidied it up a bit, and sent it to 
the amiable organ of the united 'LICENSED  VICTUALLERS'  b on Monday. 
Not inserted. At the same time, however, this highly consistent

Bakunin himself was not exactly made out to be a saint. 3 Probably 
The Morning Advertiser rejected my riposte419 because less 
confused than that of the 'NATIVE'. NOW the thing is to come out in 
The People's Paper.h 
It was through a mere lapsus linguae'—out of long habit—that I 
mentioned Mr Dronke in my letter to you. I don't believe that 
'little'  Blanqui'sd words are of any consequence, or that we shall 
gain anything by an appendix. 
The worthy little man has stirred up such a mighty pother that 
1. Lupus has never said a word to me about his departure,422 
although I had long since learnt of it through you; 2. that this 
same Lupus is always very guarded in his references to you; 3. that 
last night I was treated to a scene which was hardly creditable. 
I was busy at work. Wife and children in the room. In comes 
Lupus with portentous tread—to take his leave at last, I supposed, 
for not once in my house had he let fall a word about his 
impending departure. 
A year earlier I had borrowed a little Spanish grammar from 
him, by Franceson, maybe 120 pages.e So far as I could recall, I had 
returned the trashy object 5 months before. Or else, Dronke had 
pinched it. 
The old gentleman had already asked my wife and Lenchen 
about the thing on two previous occasions and had been told that 
they would look for it. 
Last night, then—the fellow was snappish from the moment he 
came in—I told him in as soothing tones as possible that I 
couldn't find the damned thing, that I had looked for it 
everywhere and believed I had returned it to him, etc., etc. 
'You've sold it!' came the boorish, uncouth, insolent reply. (I'd 
wager a sovereign that nowhere in London could anyone get 2 
FARTHINGS for the rubbish.) I, of course, jump to my feet, an 
altercation ensues, stubborn as a mule he persists in his nonsense, 
insults me 'au sein de ma famille'. 1 As you know, I'm willing to put 
up with a great deal from an old man in his dotage who has 
become venerable as a party tradition. However, there are limits. I 
believe the old fool was taken aback when at last I bared my teeth 
at him.

indulgence in gin, and the evaporation of the cerebral juices. 
Perhaps the sea air will have a beneficial effect on his thinking 
organ. One may, perhaps, lay claim to the privilege of being an 
'old blusterer', but one should not abuse it. My own lot is no bed 
of roses, nor can I in consequence regard his worldly worries as an 
EXCUSK. 
The hobby-horse presently being ridden by those wretched 
Russians, in both the Tribune and the London Advertiser (though 
differing in person and form), is that the Russian people is 
democratic through and through, whilst official Russia (Csar and 
bureaucracy) is exclusively German, likewise the aristocracy.423 
So Germany must be fought in Russia, not Russia in Germany. 
You know more about Russia than I do,—and if you can find 
time to challenge this nonsense (it's just the same as when the 
Teutonic jackasses blamed the French for the despotism of 
Frederick II, etc., as if backward thralls haven't always needed 
civilised thralls to train them) you would greatly oblige me. In the 
Tribune, of course.

correspond from London. The factory workers should keep 
themselves entirely to themselves and not make contact with 
philistines or other handicraftsmen in Cologne, Düsseldorf, etc. If 
they wish to send someone over here once a year to get good 
advice, we should have no objection.

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London,] 15 September 1853 
... I have today received the latest number of the Reform 
containing your piece from Quebec,3 and Kellner's apology of the 
self-same Poesche,b whose insipid  WOULD-BE  jokes about the 'cranky' 
proponents of the 'class struggle'0 appeared in the Neu-England-
Zeitung of 3 September, which reached me at the same time. You 
started sending me extra copies of the Reform at the very time I 
began to get them again regularly; on the other hand, I haven't 
been receiving the Tribune regularly and it is important that I 
should. For example, I haven't got the article in which I refer to 
the exchange of diplomatic notes on Denmark,d or the article in 
which I characterise the relationships of landed property'.... 
I think it is time you made a fresh start in the polemic and 
picked a few holes in the jejune arguments of Goepp-Poesche, 
discoverers of the material view though their materialism is that of 
the man-in-the-street. Our opponents are becoming uppish, 
something which could not have happened at least in the days of 
the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. That pedant Schläger, who more or 
[less] took to his heels at the time of the '48 revolution and 
hawked his genius in America, still regularly sends me his N.-E.-Z., 
no doubt in order to demonstrate ad oculos 1 what fine fellows they 
are. Has there ever before been a rag in which stupidity and 
vanity were so nicely coupled with presumption? 
Kellner is too much of a slow-coach, he seems unable to 
understand that polemics are essential to any journal as long as it

has to STRUGGLE. On top of that he has an unfortunate proclivity 
always to praise his enemies 2 days before they regale him with 
kicks.  Thus Heinzen and Poesche; the latter, by the by, used his 
sorry article on the circulation of money to convey the sort of 
information one gets from encyclopedias...4  6 
At any rate I find that things have begun to move sooner than I 
should have liked (I think the COMMERCIAL  DOWNFALL  will begin in the 
spring as in 1847). I had always hoped that, before that happened, 
I might somehow contrive to withdraw into solitude for a few 
months and work at my Economy.45 It seems that this isn't to be. I 
find perpetual hackwork for the newspapers tiresome. It is 
time-consuming, distracting and, in the end, amounts to very little. 
However independent one may think  oneself,  one is tied to the 
newspaper and its readers, especially when, like  myself,  one is paid 
in cash. Purely learned work is something totally different, and the 
honour of figuring beside an A.P.C.,a a LADY CORRESPONDENT and an 
archbishop is CERTAINLY not to be envied. 
Carl Wilh. Klein (of Solingen, a working man) has asked me to

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 17 September 1853 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
DEAR  Frederic, 
You're becoming damned taciturn. 
Since I was expecting YOUR ARTICLE yesterday, all I had done was 
to make up a heading from the most recent news and, since the 
letter didn't come, one lot of correspondence went by the board. 
I really must ask for your co-operation for the fortnight 
beginning today. For today Pieper is going, not into a monastery 
exactly, but into the German Hospital, a sort of medical prison, 
where he is to spend a fortnight or 3 weeks being thoroughly 
cured of the painful consequences of his carnal lust. Since I have 
in any case forfeited 3 or 4 articles through having to traipse off 
to that rotten Spielmann, a I must now write something every 
Tuesday and Friday so that the next bill I draw is not too paltry. 
There is a possibility of Freiligrath's finding a business friend who 
will regularly discount them for me. 
If you can manage to do something in between times, I shall 
send you the other stuff to look through, in which case you will 
only have to preface or conclude it with the latest news you may 
have seen about TURKEY in the Débats, say, or some particularly 
important telegraphic dispatch, before sending the stuff to 
Liverpool. 
I expect an article42' from you for Tuesday.b 
I think it important that something be said about the position of 
the armies, etc. There's a great deal of nonsense in the English 
papers, e.g. Omer Pasha is said to be crossing the Danube, etc. 
I have already sent off two articles about the commercial crisis, 1 
last Friday week about the Bank of England, its DISCOUNT and the 
effect of Peel's Act, or rather intended effect.0 1 last Tuesday on 
the price of corn, signs OF OVERPRODUCTION, etc.d

I think it important to have more details about the  MANUFACTURING 
DISTRICTS. 
Enclosed something further by the Tribune man" and 'on' him 
by the  EDITORS  of the Tribune. It would seem, by the by, that he is 
not a  Russian  AFTER  ALL, but A  GERMAN. 
The abolition of the advertisement duty means that Jones' 
advertisements now bring him in £3 a week—the PAPERb  IS ARRIVING 
TO THE PAYING POINT.  This could also provide Pieper with a source of 
income. 
When you write, you must also tell me about Lupus' travels. I 
heard later that he didn't push off from here until last Saturday.1 
FAREWELL.

Manchester, 19 September 1853 
Dear Marx, 
What has hitherto been stopping me from working and writing 
has been the presence of the 'old gent'e who is temporarily 
encamped with me. There was no berth to be had on the 
SCREW-STEAMER  and Borchardt was also very much in favour of his 
trying to get lessons here first; moreover, there were prospects for 
him in Liverpool as well. Anyway, he intends to try his luck here

and, in view of his curmudgeonly behaviour towards you in 
London,3 I would sooner not let him see how the Tribune articles 
sometimes come into being. There are a few openings here and, 
after confabulating with Borchardt and me yesterday, he has set 
out today to look around, which means that I shall have the 
evening to myself and hence will be able to concoct for you an 
article on the state of business hereabout, which will go off by the 
second post.427 The Russian one will follow as soon as possible—I 
believe the authorb  to be a German Bait or half Pole; clearly the 
chap has a great deal of material, so we must be cautious, but all 
the same we may very well be able to catch him out. Or might it 
even be Löwe, who wrote to Nesselrode in the Deutsche Londoner 
Zeitung?' To judge by the occasional prolixity and the tittle-tattle, 
here and there, this could well be so. 
The Reform is arriving very irregularly. Have you heard 
anything from Cluss? 
N. B. Since Lupus, as I see from your letter0  today, made off 
without any kind of leave-taking, he will naturally not be allowed 
to set eyes on anything you send me— il reste parfaitement en dehors 
de touf and, were it not for Borchardt, who got together £10 for 
his journey and is showing him kindness in other ways, my 
behaviour towards Monsieur Lupus would be somewhat cooler. 
Especially since the fellow, though as stubborn as ever, has lost his 
stoicism and become very dependent on those from whom he 
derives some advantage. Il est même devenu un peu flatteur 1—and 
how! 
However, we shall see whether a better position, if such is to be 
found here, doesn't soon bring the old gent to his senses again, in 
which case he'll have to ask your forgiveness as well. 
Now I am off home to work.

Quant àb Jones, I fear he has gone away. I haven't seen him for

I have split your essay into 2 and rewritten it as 2 essays3 which 
I have sent to New York, my wife acting as secretary. 
Pieper has had his throat cauterised in the German Hospital. A 
little board hangs at the foot of his bed bearing the ominous 
message: Wilhelm Pieper syphilis secundaris. He is subjected to 
rigorous discipline, which is salutary for him. 
W. Wolff has written to his confidant, Rings. He is going to try 
his luck in Manchester until the end of October. If he hasn't 
found anything by then, he will move on. For the time being, he 
says,  he is living at number such and such, Great Ducie Street,b  at 
'another's expense'. He does not name you at all, which will give 
you an idea how obstinate and petty the OLD  CHAP  can be. After the 
way he grumbled about you he is, of course, ashamed to admit 
that he has any obligation towards you. Quant à nous autres^ I 
don't know what he may have told Rings in his letter, since the 
latter says nothing about it. 
I should like to clear up the matter with Mr Dronke,d  having 
now learnt that he sold Pieper's Ricardo, likewise a German history 
of political economy belonging to the working man, Lochner, etc., 
etc. Needless to say this has reinforced my STRONG SUSPICIONS about 
him. 
Before he left, Mr Wolff gave Imandt also an account—and a 
very garbled one coloured by philistine indignation—of his 
insolent onslaught upon me.' What annoys me is the excessive 
consideration I have always shown the old blusterer instead of 
baring my teeth at him. 
Les choses marchent merveilleusement! All h [ell] will be let loose in

the whole  of his wife's3 fortune has been temporarily sequestered. 
So there will  be no  more subsidies.  I feel sorry  for  him, despite 
the absurd manner  he  thought  fit to  adopt. 
Have  you  been following  the  story about Bakunin  in The 
Morning Advertiser? b Urquhart wrote  an article  in this connectionc 
in which  he  suggests that Bakunin  is suspect  1. because  he's  A 
RUSSIAN and  2. because  he's  'A REVOLUTIONIST';  he goes  on to  assert 
that there  are no  honest revolutionaries among  the  Russians  and 
that their would-be democratic writings  (a swipe  at Herzen  and 
that polisson 6 Golovin) prove absolutely nothing;  and  finally,  he 
tells the continental revolutionaries that,  if they take Russians into 
their confidence, they  are no  less traitors than their governments. 
The Russians,  it would seem, then sent into  the  fray  an 
Englishman (Richards), who nourishes  a grudge against Urquhart, 
the latter having,  on grounds  of seniority, elbowed him out  of the 
topic  'The  Times  and  Turkey'  in The  Morning Advertiser. Richards 
maintains e that  to declare Bakunin  a SPY is just as PREPOSTEROUS as TO 
IMPEACH PALMERSTON FOR BEING BRIBED  BY RUSSIA;  he invokes the testimony 
of both Ruge  and  myself,'  praises Herzen's 'idées révolutionnaires', s 
etc. Yesterday  it was the  turn  of A. B.,  another minion  of 
Urquhart's,  who  declaredh  that  he was  acquainted with  all the 
writings  of 'la jeune Russie,'  and  that they proved  the  Tightness  of 
Urquhart's views, pan-slavism,  etc. 
At all events, les intrigants russes 1 will realise that here  it isn't as 
easy as in the  pauvre^ French democracy,  to give themselves airs, 
gain  INFLUENCE  and behave as though they were  a kind  of aristocracy 
within  the  revolutionary emigration. Here  it supposes hard 
knocks. What service have  the  jackasses done Bakunin save  to 
have him seriously accused  in public while themselves receiving  a 
slap in the  face?

ENGELS  TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,]  29 September  1853 
Dear Marx, 
Herewith  the  article  on the  Turkish armies.3  If you  tell me  what 
you are  sending tomorrow  on the  STRIKES  in Lancashire  and the 
STATE OF TRADE,429  I shall  be able  to link  on to  that  and let you  have  a 
further  REPORT  on  these matters  by  Tuesday.15430  The  local 
MANUFACTURERS  and  MERCHANTS  are at  great pains  to convince  one 
another that things  are not too bad, and the  Guardian does what  it 
can, but it's  ALL SHAM AND HUMBUG.  Since last week ordinary yarns  are 
down  by  between  'Ad and 3/sd per  pound,  i.e. at 9d a  fall in value 
of 3-4'/2%,  at 8d of 3-6%, at 7d of 4-7%; in the  same period 
COTTON  fell by about Vs.  STOCKS  are accumulating and the  HOME TRADE 
DEMAND  is also falling  off.  There  has  been such frightful overspecu-
lation  in the  Australian trade that 80,000 barrels  of American 
flour were reconsigned  to this country from Australia  at a  freight 
charge  of 8/- per  barrel.  In 4  weeks' time  the  Australian  CRASH 
Should  be  well under-  way. All  that  the  'good news' from India 
amounts  to is  that  the  rise  in prices over there  and the  fall in 
prices here added together still leave  a loss  on  exports  to that 
market. Nothing  is flourishing save  TRADE  with America  and 
speculation  in corn.  In Upbridge,  80/- per  quarter  is already being 
paid for first quality wheat.  CORN LOOKING UP, YARN LOOKING DOWN,  and 
the Turkish  rot IN THE  FAIREST  POSSIBLE WAY  OF BORING OUR MERCHANTS ALL 
WINTER  OVER. 
MANUFACTURED GOODS  are  also coming down smartly,  and  here 
STOCKS  are far  more catastrophic than  in the  case  of yarn.  The 
manufacturers' decision  to stop work thus kills  two  birds with  one 
stone:  1. it  disarms  the  workers,  2. it  cuts down production.  The 
fellows  in Preston  are  sure  to receive  a general vote  of thanks,  if 
not compensation.431  In  Ashton, Stalybridge  and  Glossop,  the 
manufacturers  are  also considering  a stoppage,  and  some here  as 
well. However there  is a  snag  to it,  namely that  it only benefits 
those  who  don't stop,  and  only harms those  who do. 
If Borchardt  is to be  believed, Lupus  has  some prospect  of

Dear Frederic, 
Your piece on the warb is capital. I myself had serious MISGIVINGS 
about the westward advance of the RUSSIAN FORCES but did not, of 
course, dare TRUST TO  MY JUDGEMENT in such matters. I have already 
written a whole series of STRIKE articles,0 produced at intervals 
throughout the 6 months during which the thing has been going 
on. Now, however, the affair has taken a new  TURN.  In the article 
where I used your STRIKE-GENERALITIES,11 I have mentioned a host of 
a A. Jacobi, 'Ueber den Untergang der Erde'. - b F. Engels, 'The Russians in 
Turkey'. - c K. Marx, 'English Prosperity.—Strikes.—The Turkish Question.— 
India', 'Russian Policy Against Turkey.—Chartism', 'Financial Failure of Govern­
ment.—Cabs.—Ireland.—The Russian Question', 'Rise in the Price of Corn.— 
Cholera.— Strikes.—Sailors' Movement', 'Panic on the London Stock Exchange.— 
Strikes'. - d  K. Marx, 'Panic on the London Stock Exchange.—Strikes' (written in 
co-authorship with Engels) (see this volume, p. 372).

STRIKE-LOCALITIES by name, also the Preston431 and Wigan432 affairs. I 
couldn't get hold of any particulars about Manchester. I have 
depicted the manoeuvring in Preston (very briefly, mind you) 1. as 
an attempt by the manufacturers to use the operatives, whose 
demands are forcing the closure of the MILLS, to cover their retreat 
from over-production; 2. as an attempt to  STARVE  THE  OPERATIVES  INTO 
SUBMISSION. 
As you can see, my HISTORY OF STRIKES goes no further than last 
Tuesday3 and doesn't touch on Manchester. 
You might, perhaps, expand somewhat the notes on yarn and 
COTTON prices and, if possible, the price of GOODS, so that they 
amount to at least one paragraph of an article. 
In each article, besides the subject proper, I naturally have to 
follow step by step the Russian Notes and England's FOREIGN POLICY 
(and right brave it is!), since the jackasses in New York consider 
this to be of prime importance and, AFTER ALL, nothing is easier to 
write about than this business of HIGH politics. 
Next Tuesday week I shall have finished an article on the 
'ORIENTAL CHURCH', and next Friday week the first of three articles on 
Denmark where next month the various assemblies of estates will 
be again taking the stage.433 
Should there be any military MOVEMENT, I shall count on receiving 
immediate information from the Ministry of Warb in Manchester, 
and the same applies to COTTONS and YARNS which are wretchedly 
covered by the papers down here. 
Above all I want to slay the fellows with my pen, the moment 
being propitious, and if at the same time you keep me supplied 
with material, I can spin out the various themes over longer 
periods. What is more, without my secretaryc I feel a little nervous 
about my English. 
No regards to Lupus.

MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 
IN NEW YORK 
[London, beginning of October 1853] 
... Blind has suddenly become aware that the knife and fork 
question4  is just as important as a South German view of the 
Turkish question. As you know, this gentleman had grown very 
grand, very much the homme d'état," very much the superior 
émigré. You will also know that an article of Pieper's poking fun 
at Russia —a frivolous scrawl well-suited to the Neu-England-
Zeitung and such as could only have been concocted on the spur 
of the moment by a homeless waif—caused Blind to loose off in 
the Neu-England-Zeitung no fewer than 3 articles within 2 months, 
more or less fraternising (true love never fades) with Heinzen, etc. 
Hence his relations with us were strained. When I say 'us' I except 
Mr Lupus, who was naturally drawn to Blind by his Morning 
Advertiser sympathies and who, for some time past, has generally 
evinced a curious tendency to snarl at his so-called party friends 
and sympathise with political philistines. A few days ago then, Mr 
Blind reappears, bringing my wife a letter to Cluss, i.e. for Wolff 
who had written him a fond letter of farewell in which he invited 
him to correspond and left him Cluss' address. 435 Needless to say, 
my wife informed him that England for the present was still 
harbouring the great Turkophile.c  But that was not, of course, the 
reason why our ex-friend of Falstaffian proportions had called. 
The court in Baden has sequestered the entire fortune of the 
children by his first marriage (the 2nd was contracted in the 13th 
arrondissement)  until such time as they are handed over to the Jews 
in Germany to be given a Jewish upbringing. Thus Mr Blind has 
been reduced to lU of his or his wife'sd income and he now 
regards the 'knife and fork question' as worthy of consideration, even 
before  the Turkish War has been decided and Petersburg taken by

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London,] 5 October 1853 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Cluss, 
That I have writer's itch, and this in the 'loftier sense of the 
term', you must needs conclude from the fact that I am writing to 
you today although—as so often nowadays—I have been working 
without a break for thirty hours on end. 
D'abord,b I want you, if it is at all possible, to get the German 
press to publish my Palmerston article.436 
On the 17th Jones will be setting forth on another tour of the 
manufacturing districts and tomorrow evening will call in here to 
get material for a campaign against that great HUMBUG.43 It is comic 
that we are forced to teach the English their own history. 
Willich's journeymen's association (the London one)/ already 
demoralised since our resignation, has now become too much of a 
good thing even for that HIPPOPOTAMUS Schapper, who has also 
withdrawn. 
Quant àd Carey and Ricardo's theory of rent 438: 
1) If we assume—as Carey would have it—that rent is simply 
another form of profit on capital or, still more precisely, of interest, 
this does not disprove but merely simplifies Ricardo's theory. The 
economic antithesis, in the most general sense, would simply 
coincide with the antithesis of capital and wage labour, PROFIT (and 
INTEREST) ON ONE SIDE and  WAGES  ON THE OTHER. The antithesis to capital 
within property would be eliminated (in so far as we disregard,

d'abord,  the antithesis between individual kinds of capital deter­
mined by the division of labour, and then, the antithesis between 
individual capitalists), but the antithesis to property would be all 
the more comprehensive. 
2) I am of course aware that, in an attempt to complete his 
theory, the worthy Carey also reduces profit (interest included) to 
wages in a different form. D'abord, is not Protestantism, for 
example, merely a different form of religion from Catholicism? 
Does the antithesis, the contradiction, the struggle between them 
cease—and that is what you are dealing with—because they are 
both religions? Thus, even assuming that profit and wages are 
simply 2 different forms of the return on labour, the result is not 
to reconcile them but merely to reduce their difference to a 
simplified expression. 
But how does he define their otherness} Profit is the wages for 
past labour. Wages are the profit on immediate present labour. Eh 
bien! 3 How does this avail him? For it is precisely from its 
thraldom, from its slavery to past, materialised labour that present, 
i.e. actual labour seeks to emerge, and from its thraldom to the 
product of labour that labour seeks to be emancipated. The old 
feudal laws were also at one time the present expression of popular 
activity. Is that any reason why we should be subjugated by them 
now? 
At best, therefore, he is merely changing the phrase 'oppression 
of labour by capital', into the phrase 'oppression of present labour 
by past labour'. 
There still remains the question, 'How do I gain possession of 
past labour?' By labour? No. By inheritance on the one hand and, 
on the other, by the fraudulent exchange of past for present 
labour. If past labour were exchanged for an equal quantity of 
present labour, the owner of past labour could continue to 
consume only so long as he had aliquot portions to exchange and, 
at a given moment, would himself have to start working again. 
3) Carey has himself wholly failed to understand Ricardo's 
theory of rent when he maintains that it is based on the successive 
deterioration of  land.  Ricardo —as I have proved in my book against 
Proudhon b—falls into the common error of all other bourgeois 
economists, when he passes off the form of landed property as an 
'eternal natural law' of history in general, whereas it is the product 
of purely industrial circumstances. His theory is true only of 
a Well! - b K. Marx, The Poverty of  Philosophy.  Answer to the 'Philosophy of Poverty' by 
M. Proudhon. On critique of Ricardo's theory of rent see Chapter II, § 4: 'Property 
or Rent'.

bourgeois society in a condition of full development. Rent, in its 
commercial form—the only one he mentions—does not otherwise 
exist at all. It therefore leaves him unaffected to maintain that at 
various historical epochs it was not the worse, but rather the 
better, lands that were SUCCESSIVELY cultivated. The historically better 
land of one period does not count as land at all for the other[s]. 
Moreover, Ricardo does not speak only of the natural properties 
of the soil, but also of its situation, a social product, a social 
attribute. 
The fertility of the soil, as I have likewise already said in the 
Anti-Proudhon, is something purely relative. Changes in the soil's 
fertility and its degree in relation to society, and that is the only 
aspect of fertility with which we are concerned, depend on 
changes in the science of chemistry and its application to 
agronomy. 
4) Assuming a given condition of society, not any society, but one 
of full bourgeois development, with a populous countryside [...] etc., 
even this part of Ricardo's theory—unessential to his system—is 
correct. 
Firstly. Types of land, with an equal infusion of capital and 
equally well situated for markets; how can their rents be 
differentiated? Merely by their natural fertility. This constitutes 
the level of rent. 
On this assumption, when will a corn field of inferior quality be 
cultivated or a less productive coal-mine be exploited? When the 
price of corn or coal has risen so high as to enable the less 
productive ones to be cultivated or exploited. Hence the cost of 
production of the poorer land determines the rent of the richer. (This is 
Ricardo's Law.) 
Secondly. Does this exclude a constant increase in fertility? 
Hence, does it include Malthus? By no means. 
If 1 is the best land, followed by 2, 3, 4, etc., and fertility is 
increased tenfold, the relation between 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., remains as 
before. Were fertility to become so great as a result of chemical 
discoveries that 1, 2 and 3 sufficed, land 4 would no longer be 
cultivated. The cost of production of land 3 (let it =3) would then 
determine the rent. When land 4 (let its production costs =4) still 
had to be brought under cultivation, the rent of land 1 (let its 
production costs =1)=4—1=3. The rent of land  3 = 3-1=2. The 
rent of land  2 = 2—1  = 1. Now, however, the rent of 1 would =2, 
that of 2 would =1 and that of 3 would =0. Should the fertility of 
the land so increase that only 1, the best land, had to be cultivated, 
rent would disappear completely.

187. Marx to Cluss. 5 October 1853 383 
5) Ricardo's theory is based not on the doctrine of rent, but on 
the law that the price of a commodity is determined by its cost of 
production. That law, however, should not be understood as 
meaning that the price of individual commodities is determined by 
their cost of production. Rather, the commodity produced under 
the most unfavourable circumstances, and made necessary because 
of the demand for it, determines the price of all other commodities 
of the same  kind.  E.g. if demand is so great that flour, the 
production price of which is 20/-a QUARTER, can be placed on the 
market, then a qr. of flour costing 19, 18, 17, 15, etc., to produce 
is also sold at 20/-. The amount by which the market price, 
regulated by the cost of production of the dearest QUARTER to be 
placed on the market, exceeds the production costs of the less 
expensively produced flour, regulates the rent. What, then, gives 
rise to rent? Not the land, as supposed by Ricardo, but the market 
price and the laws by which it is regulated. If the quarter, which 
costs only 15/-(profit included) were sold, not at 20/-, but at 15, 
it could not carry a rent of 5. Why, then, does it do so? Because 
the market price is regulated by the flour the cost of production 
of which =20. In order that this may be placed on the market, 20 
must be the general market price. Hence, if rent is to be 
overthrown, it must not be interpreted philanthropically; rather 
the laws of market price and thus of prices generally and thus 
the whole FRAMEWORK of the bourgeois economy must be over­
thrown. 
So much for today on this subject. 
Your 
On types of land having the same properties and an equally 
favourable situation, the rent will, however, be determined merely 
by the proportion of capital wedded to the land. Nor does Ricardo 
deny this. Rent is then merely interest on capital fixe. 3 To say that, 
in cases in which rent does not exist in an actual, specific sense, its 
specific antithesis to capital and labour does not exist either, is no 
less true than to say that, where there is neither labour nor 
investment of capital, no antithesis between capital and wage 
labour exists. Instead there is, in the case under consideration, an 
antithesis between profit and interest, between rentiers (in the 
ordinary sense) and industrial capitalists. The less the tenant pays 
a fixed capital 
14* 

=====第416页=====
384 187. Marx to Cluss. 5 October 1853 
the man whose capital is wedded to the land, the greater will be 
his profit and vice versa. The tenant and his LANDLORD (even though 
the latter simply draws interest on the capital employed on the 
land) would thus be as much at loggerheads as before. 
The case most favourable to Carey is as follows: 
Let the product of labour, the profit and interest =  2, rent =1, 
wages =2. Now if, as a result of a rise in the productivity of 
labour, the product doubles and =10, the rent might =2, profit 
and interest =4, wages =4. To that extent it could be said that 
every kind of revenue may increase at no expense to labour and 
without landowner, capitalist and worker being mutually at 
loggerheads. But: 
1) Assuming this most favourable instance to be real, all it 
means is that the antitheses—rent, profit, wages—all three, 
become more marked without losing any of their qualitative 
position relative to one another; 
2) Relatively they can only rise or fall at each other's expense. In 
the foregoing example, the proportion =1:2:2. Does not the ratio 
remain the same if it =2:4:4? A change in this relative income 
would occur if, for example, wages were to =5, profit =3, and 
rent =2. The profit would then have fallen relatively, although in 
absolute terms it would have risen. 
3) It is par trop 3 naive to suggest that, if the total product of labour 
rises,  the three classes among whom it is to be shared will share 
equally in that growth. If profit were to rise by 20%, the workers 
would have to strike to obtain a 2% rise in WAGES. 
4) The conditions that govern an increase in the total product preclude 
such relatively equal  increase  from the  outset.  If the increase is due to a 
better division of labour, or to a greater employment of 
machinery, the worker is, from the outset, placed at a disadvan­
tage vis-à-vis the capitalist. If it be due to increased fertility of the 
soil, the landowner is worse off vis-à-vis the capitalist.

IN MANCHESTER 
London, 8 October 1853 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
D'abord" I must ask you—if you can—to send by return at least 
a minimum of money. Two weeks ago Spielmann finally paid up 
after deducting nearly £2. In the meantime, of course, debts had 
mounted up so much, so many of our absolute essentials had 
found their way to the pawnbroker's and the family had grown so 
shabby, that for the past 10 days there hasn't been a sou in the 
house. I now possess proof that I have been cheated by 
Spielmann, but à quoi bon ? At my request the firm in New York 
returned me the bill together with a letter from which it emerges 
that payment was made as early as 22 July, whereas I didn't receive 
the money until the end of September. I now have a further £24 
to draw. (Since Pieper's incarceration I have sent in 6 articles, 
among them a fulminating acte d'accusation" of Palmerston, in 
which I trace his career from 1808 to 1832. d I shall hardly be able 
to deliver the sequel by Tuesday, since there are a great many 
Blue Books and Hansards to be consulted and Friday and today 
were utterly wasted in traipsing around after money. I wrote 
Friday's article' during the night, dictated it to my wife from 7 to 
11 in the morning, then took Shanks's pony to the City.) 
Freiligrath has promised—and will do everything he can to that 
end, i.e. endorse it  himself,  etc.—to discount the bill for me with 
Bischoffsheim, but is unable to arrange the matter for another 8 
to 10 days. Such is the casus belli. I shall have to see how I can get 
through the next few days. Credit is not available for food

be Pieper who will probably come out of hospital tomorrow— peut-
être. 11 As soon as I got my money I sent him £3, but the jackass 
entrusted it to Liebknecht for safekeeping and will now find 
there's not a farthing left. 
Of the many pleasures I have experienced during my years 
here,  the greatest have consistently been provided by so-called 
party friends—red  Wolff, b Lupus, Dronke, etc. Today Freiligrath 
told me that Franz Joseph Daniels is in London and had been to 
see him with red  Wolff.  He, Daniels, declared he wouldn't come to 
see me because my association with Bangya had brought about his 
brother's0 arrest which would not otherwise have occurred. 
Bangya first called on me in February 1852, and Daniels was 
locked up in May 1851! A very retrospective effect, then. All this 
infamous gossip (the reward for my trouble and loss of time, and 
such-like agreeable consequences of the triald) is, of course, 
eagerly seized upon as an excuse for their own lamentable 
behaviour towards me and their cowardly retreat. However this 
vile business is attributable solely to the bandying about of 
ill-natured remarks by Messrs Dronke and W. Wolff who have 
kept for themselves the easier part, i.e. cancan,'' being otherwise 
perfectly content to leave the work to me. 
If my life was an easy, or at least a carefree one, I wouldn't, of 
course, give a fig for these scurrilities. But when, year after year, 
the bourgeois mire is laced with this and similar kinds of mire, c'est 
un peu fort. 1 I propose at the next opportunity to declare publicly 
that I have nothing whatever to do with any party. I no longer feel 
inclined to allow myself to be insulted by any old party jackass on 
so-called party grounds. 
You can see how necessary it is to get my pamphlet8 into 
Germany. Since you can't do it  yourself,  let me have Strohn's 
address and I will take the matter up with him. 
I would also much like to hear at last what Mr Dronke has to 
say about the book."1 As for Mr Lupus, he apparently wishes to 
make up for his servility towards his bourgeois patrons by being 
abominably insolent towards  myself.  I can assure him that he has 
by no means settled this matter by boasting to Imandt that, on the 
pretext of coming to say good-bye, he had vented his philistine 
spleen on me.

MARX TO KARL BLIND 
IN LONDON 
London, 13 October 1853 
28 [Dean Street], Soho 
Dear Blind, 
Immediately after you called on me, I went to see Freiligrath in 
order to secure his good offices in getting my bill discounted. 
Freiligrath did indeed undertake to do this, but has so far not 
managed to arrange the thing since his principal*—whom he 
needs for the transaction and who has been expected back these 
past 8-10 days—has not yet returned. Thus I am sans sousb— 
although I have almost £30 to draw. Yet the thing must be settled 
within a few days. 
As I was unable to obtain this money against my bill, I looked 
round elsewhere so that I could send you the £1 forthwith, but 
was everywhere met with a snub. 
So, like  myself,  you will have to be patient for a few days and 
will, I am sure, realise that nothing could be more vexing to me 
than my present inability to settle the matter immediately. 
Quant à° Jones, I can't understand anything. Since you were here 
he has been to see me twice and positively assured me he had written 
to you. It's not his way to lie about such things. Can his letter have 
been intercepted? He'll be here again tomorrow, when I shall get 
him to write to you in my presence. Then I shall myself take the 
letter to the post. He is leaving on Monday. d 
Warm regards to you and your wife.

Dear Cluss, 
You really  did [...] too  much  in going  to the  trouble  of copying 
out the  Chinese thing.3  AT  THOSE EXPENSES  I would certainly  not  have 
had the  impertinence  to ask you for the  article.442  Dana copied  my 
stuff almost word  for  word, watering down this  and  that and, with 
rare tact, deleting anything  of an  audacious nature.  NEVER MIND.  IT IS 
A BUSINESS  OF HIS. NOT OF  MINE.  In one of my Indian articles he also 
amended the bit where I speak of cholera as  'THE  INDIANS  REVENGE  UPON 
THE WESTERN WORLD'  to 'INDIA'S RAVAGES'  which is nonsense. En passant^ 
Freiligrath solicited that 'revenge'  for a  poem about cholera upon 
which  he is  still  at work. 
Again,  in another  of my  articles  on  India/ dealing with  the 
princes there, he transmogrified  'THE  SKELETON  OF ETIQUETTE'  into  'THE 
SECLUSION (PITIFUL!)  OF ETIQUETTE'. NEVER MIND!  Provided he pays. 
My wife  has  also compromised  me by  putting Rinaldo  for 
Ruggiero  and  Alcide  for  Alcinee  in the  first article  on Palmerston. 
These  are 'les petites misères' f of an  écrivain 8 whose  own 
handwriting  is illegible. 443 But it's a  bitter pill  for a man who 
knows  his  Ariosto from  A to Z in the  original. Divinoh Ariosto! 
It's a big  jump from Ariosto  to Klein,  or rather  a long fall,  and 
a casus obliquus'  at that. Papa Klein wrote  to me—not  a word,  of 
course, about  his  upsets  and  rows—asking  for  recommendations 
to you and  Weydemeyer.  In my  reply (Pieper  has not  written  him

that Weydemeyer  was  unfriendly  to me.3 How  could anyone 
suppose  me  capable  of such stupidity  and  baseness?  Mr  Klein 
would have  had to  conclude from  my  harmless remark about 
Cluss'  being  'our  party's most talented  and  energetic representative 
in America',b that  I was  denying  all  talent  and  energy  to 
Weydemeyer. However, such sophisticated word-juggling  is 
beyond  the  reach  of  Klein's intellect. Hence  all his  remark 
amounts  to is a  piece  of nonsense invented  in order  to give vent  to 
his annoyance.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ALL  THIS,  YOU ARE  RIGHT,  SIR,  IN HAVING 
WRITTEN TO MR  SNUG.C 
Klein really does wield some influence over  the  Solingen 
workers,  and  they  are the  best  in the  Rhine province.  I, pour  ma 
part, d have never, either drunk  or sober, expressed  the  view that 
the workers  are fit  only  for  cannonfodder, although  the  louts, 
among whom little Kleine  is evidently coming  to rank  himself, 
are, to my  mind, barely  fit even  for  that.  It would  be as  well  to 
treat little Klein with your accustomed  DISCRETION  as a  tool that 
may perhaps (?),  IN TIME  OF ACTION,  be of use to us. 
Have forwarded  the  letter  to Pieper. There's nothing doing with 
the Gradaus  for it  doesn't  pay, and  Pieper  is too  badly  off to  write 
gratis. 
As regards  the  Reform,  I shall  see  what  I can get the  others  to 
do. The  only  one  from whom  any  real support  can be  expected  is 
Engels. Red  Wolff f is married and a retailer of  HOUSEHOLD WORDS  for 
Prutz, Gutzkow  and  Cotta,  not  worth  a FARTHING  to us  just  now. 
Lupus  no  longer writes;  he's so  obstinate that  he cannot  be made 
to forget  the  unfortunate business  of Weydemeyer's Revolution. 2 
Dronke, presently  a clerk  in Bradford, idle  as a  grisette. Weerth, 
travelling about South  and  North America  on business  for  nearly  a 
year now.  Engels really  has too  much work,  but  being  a veritable 
walking encyclopaedia,  he's  capable, drunk  or sober,  of working  at 
any hour  of the day or  night,  is a  fast writer  and  devilish  QUICK  in 
the uptake,  so he at  least  can be  expected  to do  something  in this 
respect.

appropriate his opponents' catch-words when they're already stale 
and fit for nothing. Delectable, the chap's aspirations to dignity, 
and then his scraps! Serves him right! 
Rent In the Misère" I cite an example of how in England, 
land which, at a certain stage of science, was regarded as barren, 
is, at a more advanced stage, considered fertile. I can adduce as a 
general fact that, throughout the middle ages, esp. in Germany, 
heavy clay soil was cultivated by preference as being naturally more 
fertile. In the past 4-5 decades, however, owing to the introduction 
of potatoes, sheep-farming and the resulting manuring, etc., light 
sandy soil has taken pride of place, esp. since it involves no EXPENSES 
OF DRAINAGE,  etc., and on the other hand its deficiencies can easily be 
made good by means of chemical fertilisers. From this, then, it 
may be seen how relative 'fertility' is, even 'natural' fertility, and at 
the same time how ill-informed Mr Carey is, even from the point 
of view of history, when he expresses the opinion that the most 
barren land is always the first to be brought under cultivation. b 
What leads him to that conclusion? The fact that tropical swamps 
are damned fertile but reclaimable only by civilisation. A tropical 
swamp, however, is productive not so much of herbs as of weeds. 
Civilisation clearly originates in those regions where wheat grows 
wild, as was the case in part of Asia Minor, etc. Such land is 
rightly described as naturally fertile by historians—and not land 
yielding poisonous vegetation and requiring more strenuous 
cultivation if it is to become fertile for human beings. Fertility is 
not, after all, absolute but merely a relation of the land to human 
requirements. 
Ricardo's law only holds good within bourgeois society. Hence it 
is where the relationship of the bourgeois to the land is purely

Mes remerciements pour les deux articles.d  I fear you have been too 
biassed by Mr Smitt e in favour of Russia's military achievements. 
D'abordJ as regards the 1828-29 campaign, it was a wretched affair 
in the opinion of most contemporains%; I base myself inter alia, on 
the REPORT submitted to the Duke of Wellington by his ADC and 
published in The Portfolio.h The fortresses were bought rather than 
stormed. In general, BRIBERY played a major role in the campaign.

After passing through the Balkans, Diebitsch was not sure whether 
he had come to conquer or to be miserably cut off and captured. 
What saved him was BRIBERY, this time of one of the Pashas in 
command, and the  UTTER  DISSOLUTION of THE  TURKISH  ARMY.  Russia began 
the war when the fleet had been destroyed off Navarino 444 and the 
Turkish army's traditional organisation had been destroyed by 
Mahmud and no new one had yet been established. In any case, 
circumstances are different now. 
Over the past 2 weeks the Débats has been publishing articles on 
the campaigns of '28-'29, which, however, I have not read. I shall 
look out further material at the library. 
Pieper has been out of hospital for a week—and is doubly 
occupied, 1. as correspondent of the Washington Union, arranged 
by Cluss and 2. as CLERK (from 9-5) at 25/-  A WEEK  with a crapaud 3 in 
the City. Hence of no further use to me. Tant mieux h for him. I'm 
glad he's out of the mire. 
I am sending you the continuation of the Palmerston.c Jones has 
asked me for the next instalment. I have sent an article for this once d 
but with the proviso that he would get no more if he didn't put an 
end to the abominable printing errors (this time glaring to the point 
of distortion). The manuscript was written very neatly. 
Rings, stricken by madness, has spent several days in the

Dear Engels, 
You must let me have something by the day after tomorrow, 
even if only 1 or 2 pages (if you are short of time) on the CROSSING 
of the DANUBE by the Turks when they took Kalafat. Yesierday I 
reported the news* as VERY DOUBTFUL. But it seems likely to be 
confirmed and tomorrow's papers will at any rate tell you how 
things stand. Now that scientific opinions are beginning to be 
expressed on the subject, I can neither remain silent nor discuss it 
from the standpoint of 'sound common sense'.b According to the 
news in the French press, Shamyl has roundly trounced the 
Russians and is actually threatening Tiflis, while General Voron-
tsov has written to his government informing it that, once he is 
threatened from 2 sides, he will not be able to hold Georgia 
without substantial reinforcements. 
Of late the Tribune has been considerably exercising its 
annexationist policy. To begin with your first military article was 
annexed as a LEADER, then my Palmerston,c further instalments of 
which are thus foredoomed to annexation. Strange though it may 
seem to you, by following exactly in the footsteps of the NOBLE 
VISCOUNT during the past 20 years, I have come to the same 
conclusion as that monomaniac Urquhart—namely that for several 
decades Palmerston has been in the pay of Russia. As soon as you 
have read the further instalments of my article (especially the bits 
about the Turko-Syrian conflictd) I would like to have your views 
on the subject. I am glad that chance should have led me to take a 
closer look at the foreign policy—diplomatic—of the past 20 
years.  We had very much neglected this aspect, and one ought to 
know with whom one is dealing.

Dear Engels, 
Herewith the great Karl Heinzen's invective against myself and 
communism in his Herold des Westens. 
Also a letter from Cluss. From it you will see that Willich's fiery 
rocketb is arriving by the next post. The worst of it is that the 
fellows will be peddling their lampoon throughout the whole of 
Germany while my pamphletc reposes quietly in Manchester and 
London—and that in Heinzen they once more possess a vocifer­
ous sounding-board, whereas a few months ago the only organ at 
Willich's disposal was the Criminal-Zeitung. When the trash arrives 
I shall let you have it immediately, so that you can write and tell 
me what you think we ought to do. 
You will see from Cluss' letter how things stand with the 
Reform.445 Get the 'old man'd and Dronke to write for it. They have

... As regards the Reform, I shall see what can be done in 
Germany and Paris. Pieper is now in business and spends from 9 
in the morning until 8 at night in the City. So what with his work 
as correspondent for the Union, has little time. He'll do something. 
If any money is forthcoming, I would suggest that Eccarius get 
some first so that he doesn't have to spend all day tailoring. In 
accordance with an agreement made with me, he will now be 
sending articles regularly. Do try and see that he gets something, if 
at all possible. With regard to his French articles, Jones is no 
longer printing them, 447 nor has he returned me the manuscript, 
which isn't therefore available dans ce moment,* Jones being away 
on an agitation tour. I have written to him about it, however. 448 I 
have also asked Heise. Diversity is desirable and, by consorting 
with us Heise will, I believe, change for the better. I have asked 
Lupus and Dronke through Engels. Probably little will come of it. 
In Lupus' case, age and bachelorhood combine to lead him into 
mischief during this sorry interregnum. 
Not yet seen Willich's damp squib.c  The war news takes up 
almost my whole attention and there's no time left to think about

passed through the hands of the Vienna police—i.e. been 
censored. The news from Constantinople is of course much 
delayed. The heroes of democracy are preparing to march. An 
evil omen for the Turks. 
Quant àa Willich, I should much prefer it if I could be spared 
personal statements and my contribution be confined to produc­
ing, for the feuilleton of the Reform, a psychological—or rather, 
phenomenological—genre picture of this shabby philistine's 'form 
of consciousness'. 
Last Tuesday,b  at the same time as your letter, I received one 
from Klein which was, I must say, most delightfully written, witty 
and considered. He tells me that he, too, will make a statement 
against Willich, since he can prove that the man was a fraud all 
the time he was in London. Klein is obsessed with the idea that 
you people are treating him very much de haut en bas. I shall try 
and smooth out this difference. 
As regards the Tribune, the most ingenious way of handling the 
thing might have been to make people believe they 'recognised my 
style'. 449 I have become very thick with Urquhart as a result of the 
Palmerston article.0 To help me, he has sent me several 
books—with which, however, I was already familiar...450

Bradford. Not having received the trash from Dronke, I was 
rummaging by chance amongst some old letters when I lit upon 
the corpus delicti with the incriminating passage which I quote 
verbatim. The letter was addressed to you. 453 Now, should Mr 
Dronke use adjectival caustic to obliterate factual accuracy, he'll 
have only himself to blame if / send his letter to New York as 
proof that I, du moins," am accurate. It contains some strange 
passages which would now undoubtedly embarrass him, e.g. 
concerning that 'fanatical lout Imandt', maintenant* an intimate 
friend to whom he writes twice weekly. Everyone knows how 
addicted the little man is to mischief-mongering while our backs 
are turned.

Harney did not dare take the CHAIR, was terribly mauled, buffeted,

From the telegram I received from you this morning I naturally 
cannot tell: 
1. Whether Cluss', etc., answers'1  and the issues of the Reform 
relating to Willich e have reached you from New York. The 
contrary would seem possible, since Mr Lupus, in a fatuous letter 
to Cluss, seeks to conceal his laziness by inveighing against 
Weydemeyer. 
2. Has Dronke returned the relevant numbers of the Criminal-
Zeitung1 } I asked Steffen to get you to send them to him in 
Chester, since I can't do without the one copy I have down here. 
When—induced by you—I came in my last letter 8 to speak of the 
odd affair of 'the well-known gentleman, Dr Dronke's' statement, 
it occurred to me that the immediate upshot would be that I 
would get no private letters from you until the affair could be 
assumed to have blown over—say a week or two. At least, that is 
the method which, since Mr Lupus' arrival in Manchester, you 
have adhered to with unusual consistency in all matters concerning

Dear Frederic, 
As you know, everyone gets an occasional bee in his bonnet, and 
nihil humani3 etc. Needless to say, there was never any question of 
'conspiring' and suchlike nonsense.457  You are accustomed to  SOME 
JEALOUSY and, au fond^  the only thing that vexes me is our not being 
able to be together now, to work and have fun together, whereas 
your 'protégés' have you conveniently to hand. 
Enclosed one copy of the Knight. The other arrived in 
Washington either today or yesterday. I sent the thing to Cluss so 
that the 2 statements' should not conflict, and so that he can 
delete anything that has already been said. A few small stylistic 
changes were made in the copy I sent. The last page is missing 
from the one I sent you; it got mislaid and contains only a few 
concluding remarks in a humorous vein. 
Although we have heard nothing of him, Willich must be back in 
London again. Did you see in the Reform the splendid minutes of the 
meeting presided over by Anneke, in which not a single person 
a Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (1 am a man and I think nothing

declares himself willing to return to Germany as 'a revolutionary 
fighter under Willich's military leadership'? 3 
Quant ab Palmerston,c I could agree to a 'German' version only 
if I could be sure that the work would subsequently be accepted by 
a publisher. For I haven't a German MS, since I myself had to 
write the thing in English, i.e. Anglo-Saxonise the original from 
the word go. As regards the Tribune I intend to conclude with the 
TREATIES  OF 1840 AND  '41,458  and for this I have at my disposal some 
very bulky BLUE BOOKS, BESIDES Hansard and the Moniteur. Have left 
out Palmerston's machinations in GREECE, Afghanistan, Persia and 
Serbia, as being of lesser importance. That would still leave the 
revolutionary period 459 for which the  BLUE BOOKS  again provide 
important (if considerably curtailed) material, as well as for our 
'patriotic' war, etc., in Schleswig-Holstein 
Concerning your Bonaparte as a captain of artillery, or writer 
thereon, I think you would do best to send a paper of this sort 
under your own name either to 1. The Daily News, 2. The 
Exarriiner, or 3. The Westminster Review. The first would probably 
be best. An article of this kind would at one fell swoop—par coup 
d'état d—put you in such a position vis-à-vis the London Press that 
you could 'press' it and at the same time, perhaps, get a chance to 
have your book on the Hungarian compaign e published in English 
in London, which would in any case be more profitable and 
effective than in POOR old Leipzig. 
Needless to say, the Tribune is making a great splash with your 
articles,  POOR  Dana, no doubt, being regarded as their author. At 
the same time they have appropriated 'Palmerston', which means 
that, for 8 weeks past, Marx-Engels have virtually constituted the 
EDITORIAL  STAFF  of the  Tribune. 
In addition to your lengthier expositions which are appropriated 
by them for LEADERS and are feasible only in the case of certain 
important EVENTS or periods, e.g. the initial phase, then the battle 
of Oltenitza, etc., I should be grateful if (time permitting) you 
could—during the less important interludes—let me have a brief 
summary of the facts—1-2 pages, say—in English. I have greater 
difficulties—even from the language standpoint—with the lesser 
stuff than with profound (!) expositions, especially with material I 
have long been familiar with by reading in an English context, i.e. 
English works. I only require this, of course, when there is a

dearth of 'great' événements. 3 The main difficulty is the uneasiness 
of my critical conscience in regard to matters with which I feel I 
am not à la hauteur. h My competitor0 quite simply copies out the 
facts (or rather what are given out as such by the London Press). 
What do you think of my brother-in-law Juta's proposal, 
enclosed herewith, that we should write a monthly article for the 
Zuid-Afrikaan (Cape Town)?460 Rotten though Juta's French may 
be, he's a good, sensible chap. If only you and I had set up an 
English correspondence business at the right moment in London, 
you wouldn't be stuck in Manchester tormented by the office, nor 
I tormented by debts. Incidentally, I believe that if you were to 
send military articles to the London papers now, you would, 
within a few weeks, be able to secure a permanent post which 
would pay as well as the Manchester business and leave you more 
spare time. At present the DEMAND FOR MILITARY WRITERS exceeds the 
supply. 
It might even be asked whether The Times itself might not be 
very glad to hook a MILITARY COLLABORATOR since it is wretchedly 
served in this respect. It would be worth trying. For we have, of 
course, now reached the stage at which we regard any English 
newspaper merely as an emporium and it matters not a rap in 
which of these emporia we display our 'articles', supposé 6 they are 
not tampered with.

Dear Engels, 
Since the day you left,461  the whole FAMILY has been prostrated by 
influenza, etc. Musch and I are still very much down. Thus 
through physical causes I have already been cheated of 3 articles 
for the Tribune which, considering the weather, is dur.* Let me 
know if you can provide me with one article for next week, on any 
subject you like. But I must know for certain if and when. h 
Being still confined to my room, I have not, of course, been able 
to keep up with the newspapers. Pieper tells me that in today's 
Morning Herald there is a long article on the Russian plan of 
campaign^ The main theatre to be Asia, not Europe. They 
proposed to take Constantinople from the direction of Asia Minor 
(!) etc., etc. 
Three volumes of Joseph Bonaparte's Memoirs^ have so far 
come out. The third contains the old Napoleon's correspondence 
on the Peninsular campaign.462 
Just now I was interrupted by Musch, who is raving and 
thrashing about, etc., in a high fever. I hope the little man will 
soon recover.

Dear Engels,

which I got my wife to copy out, then added a word or two at the 
beginning and the end, and thus produced an article." So I shall

by Friday morning so that I can give the stuff the finishing touches.

The enclosed is from Cluss. I shall send you the other part of it

Dear Frederic, 
You must let me have by Fridaya something of a general nature 
(it is hardly possible to be specific) about the Battle of Citale or 
Zitale.b It seems to me that: 
1. The battle of Oltenitza was a misunderstanding which 
frustrated the armistice imposed by the Ambassadors on the Porte. 
Similarly the Battle of Citatea4 was a misunderstanding which 
frustrated the peace proposals dictated to the Porte under the 
guns of the English warships. 
2. The obverse of Oltenitza. In the one case the Turks 
entrenched, in the other the Russians, etc. 
3. Same result. After a murderous set-to lasting five days, the 
fellows drew in their respective horns. All I see is the result. I 
don't know what should have happened. All I do know is that this 
is not the way Napoleon fought a war. 
So enmeshed in their own webs have the diplomatic intriguers 
become that a guerre  générale 11 is imminent. As you know, the EVENT 
AT Sinope—not to mention Mr Redcliffe's threats—was intended 
to induce the Turks to accept the Protocol of Vienna and bring 
Halil and Riza Pasha into the government. 467 Once all this had 
a 20 January. - b Marx took the wrong spelling from the English newspapers;

been engineered, Palmerston resigned.468  On 19 December, while 
he was still out of office, the coalition smelt a rat and ordered a 
demonstration in the Black Sea. Palmerston, doubly discredited, 
returned to office and effected the decision of the 26th, that the 
entire fleet was to sail into the Black Sea, but to do no more than 
assume a neutral role vis-à-vis the two BELLIGERENTS; ostensibly going 
further than the decision of the 19th, but in fact attempting to 
thwart it and cut the Turks off from their Asiatic theatre of war. 
In the meantime, however, Mr Bonaparte, basing himself on the 
decision of the 19th, has already issued contrary orders and 
purports to interpret the decision of the 26th merely as an 
extension of the first. Palmerston,  OF COURSE, had to make the best 
of a bad thing and preserve his reputation as an energetic patriot. 
In this way the fellows have got themselves into a pretty pickle and 
their dissimulation will land them in an even worse one, especially 
since Parliament will have to be shown on the 31st that 'energetic' 
steps are being taken. The Note which the fellows submitted to 
the Turks for signature shows that the former were prepared for 
a total SURRENDER TO RUSSIA and that only 'misunderstandings' 
frustrated this good intention. 470 
My brother-in-law— le ministre 3—wrote and told my mother-in-
law11 that she was unfortunately about to relive her experience of 
40 years ago, namely a general war.4 ' 
I forwarded your letter to Steffen 472 the same day to Brussels 
where Steffen is still staying with his sister. I fear that, at this 
particular juncture, your 'Napoleon as Lieutenant of Artillery' 473 
will be rejected, as The Times has had orders to refrain from any 
semblance of anti-Bonaparte polemics. Since he is 'our' ally, every 
paper will be moved by the same patriotic considerations just now. 
Anyway, as soon as the thing is ready, and if the papers won't 
have it, we shall bring it out as a pamphlet. Where my own work is 
concerned, I feel embarrassed about offering it to a publisher. The 
same gêne c would not apply to yours. 
That jackass Weydemeyer has again shelved 'the noble con­
sciousness'.'1 The main thing was speed in answering. 6 weeks too 
late, and the thing's SILLY. I cannot understand Cluss, and why he 
should always pick on me of all people to be Mr Weydemeyer's 
victim.

Dear Frederic, 
Enclosed note  for  Lupus,  who has  written  to me. 474 Absolution.b 
As to the war,  there will  now be  some snags, unless  MISUNDER­
STANDINGS'  OCCUR  that have nothing  to do  with,  or run  counter  to, 
diplomacy. Reshid Pasha's Note4 spells total  SURRENDER TO RUSSIA.  It 
even contains more concessions than the  ORIGINAL VIENNA NOTE  as a 
result  of  which Turkey declared war.476 Palmerston  has not 
returned  to office  in vain.c  On the  other hand,  the  demonstration 
in the  BLACK  SEA would seem to be a  DODGE,  specially contrived 
for the  MEETING  of Parliament:  if Russia accepts  her own  con­
ditions incorporated  in  Reshid's Note  and  obtains everything 
she has  demanded,  she  will appear  to  have bowed  to  force 
supérieure. That,  in any  case,  is the  plan. Otherwise, would  it not 
be absurd to inform Nicholas of the entry of the  UNITED FLEETS 
before  he had, or  could have, pronounced upon  the  last  VIENNA 
NOTE?  Now  only  an  accident  of war  could bring about  a warlike 
solution.  By  prior agreement  the  Czar,  far  from objecting  to the 
ENTRANCE  OF THE  UNITED SQUADRON,  showed considerable  TEMPER. 477 
However, there's no vouching for  MISUNDERSTANDINGS'.  They  ARE  EVER 
PROBABLE.

Russians are said to have made simultaneously at Matchin, 
Giurgevo and Kalafat and, indeed, the capture of Silistria, would 
seem MERE HUMBUG. Apropos, one more thing: your opinion, written 
in English. According to the French newspapers, the Turks intend 
to fortify Constantinople on the landward side.3  Would this not be 
a major blow for Russia? The more so as Constantinople will 
always be able to communicate by sea with the Asiatic and 
European coasts of its EMPIRE and thus cannot be cut off from its 
supplies of men and materials? Large-scale fortifications would 
now seem to be the ANTIDOTE to large-scale warfare à la Napoleon. 
May this not bring about a reversion to small-scale warfare? 
It is scandalous that Berlin is not being fortified. 
My brother-in-law, le ministre, has written to my mother-in-law 
warning her that now, in her ripe old age, she is about to go 
through the same experience as in the days of Napoleon I. b He 
believes, then, that there'll be war. 
Cobden, the 'UMBLE- and HOMELY  MAW  made a considerable ass of 
himself in his last speech. He demonstrates that neither he nor the 
'UMBLE  MEN-  who applaud him, are competent to govern England. 
The Quaker Bright will hear of nothing but the war within. 
Cobden's discovery that the social structure of England and Russia 
are analogous because there are Demidovs there and Derbys here, 
is worthy of a Palatinate revolutionary philistine from Neustadt. 478 
On Saturday Mr Pieper went to visit Meyer in Brighton. 
Unwelcome though he is to the latter, he is overstaying the time 
allotted him by Troupeau, because the 'sea air' suits him, and has, 
it seems, written the bourgeois a fatuous letter. The silly lad 
mistakes his lack of principles for genial high spirits. From Cluss' 
letter 479 you will see that this same 'genial' youth wanted to obtain 
an American passport to Constantinople, probably in the hope of 
becoming a kennelboy there. It's triste" that the lad should be so 
thoroughly pleased with himself as to do one silly thing after 
another and make a laughing-stock of  himself.

that I was a  'REVOLUTIONIST'.  He is an  utter maniac.  Is firmly 
convinced THAT  HE WILL  ONE DAY BE  PREMIER  of England. When everyone 
else is downtrodden, England will come  to him and say:  SAVE US, 
Urquhart!  AND THEN HE WILL SAVE HER.  While speaking, particularly if 
contradicted,  he goes into FITS which  I find  all the  more comical  as 
I know  by heart  his every platitude  and  quotation. This made  me 
regard  his  'FITS'  as EVEN somewhat SUSPECT  and  RATHER  as a  theatrical 
EXHIBITION.  The  fellow's most comical idea  is this: Russia rules  the 
world through having  a specific superfluity  of  BRAIN.  TO  COPE  WITH 
HER, a man  must have  the  BRAIN  of an  Urquhart  and, if one has the 
misfortune  not to be  Urquhart  himself,  one  should  at least  be an 
Urquhartite,  i.e.  believe what Urquhart believes,  his 'metaphysics', 
his 'POLITICAL ECONOMY'  etc., etc. One  should have been  in the  'EAST', 
or at least have absorbed  the  Turkish 'spirit',  etc.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 23 March 1854 
Dear Marx, 
I return Lassalle's letter herewith. At the time I forgot to 
enclose the first one, which is still here.493 You'll have received the 
two half notes yesterday and the day before. T/B 58 166, 
Newcastle on Tyne, 17 August 1852, £5. 
Lassalle's strategical operations are very diplomatic. His answer 
to the Enos and Rodosto affair is the foolish platitude, itself 
merely intended as dust in the eyes, that Constantinople must be 
protected494; if the 2 fleets and the Army of the Danube cannot 
protect it, then neither can 100,000 French and English. From his 
own standpoint, what he ought to have said was: if they are to be 
launched against Sevastopol or Odessa, they are, at any rate, closer 
to hand at Rodosto than in Malta or Toulon. 
The notion that a move into Serbia would place the Austrians 
'in the rear of the Turkish Army of the Danube' is basically 
wrong. The Austrians must make their crossing at Belgrade or not 
very far below it, or else enter Wallachia via Mehadia along the 
left bank of the Danube. In the first case they would find 
themselves in the extension of the Turkish left wing, in the second, 
to the front of it. That this would mean the immediate sacrifice of 
Kalafat and Vidin, with the exception of the garrison, is 
evident—but not that this Turkish left wing would be lost and its 

=====第452页=====
420 210. Engels to Marx. 23 March 1854 
remnants compelled to fall back on the Shumla line. Au contraire, 3 
1. the correct tactics for the Austrians would be to march 
immediately on Sofia via Nissa, hence the correct tactics for the 
Turks would be to withdraw from Vidin, likewise to Sofia, Not 
having so far to go, they would be there before the Austrians and 
could either make a stand in the Balkans or withdraw towards 
Adrianople.495 
2. Should the Austrians be stupid enough to march on Vidin, 
the Turks would still make for Sofia. This division of Omer 
Pasha's principal corps would not involve the fragmentation of his 
forces, since the new enemy would necessitate a new Adrianople-
Sofia-Belgrade-Vidin operational line; thus the Turkish left wing 
would become an independent army. 
3. But should Lassalle's peculiar strategy  COME  TO PASS,  no amount 
of falling back on the Shumla line would avail, for the latter, 
having already been outflanked as a result of the sacrifice of the 
highway from Belgrade to Constantinople, would, on the contrary, 
have to be abandoned all the more precipitately in order to 
assemble all available reserves at Adrianople and advance against the 
first enemy to pass through the Balkans. 
One can see, incidentally, that these lucubrations all emanate 
from that 'diplomatic source' which seems to enjoy showing off on 
the subject of strategic developments. 
Tomorrow I shall be sending The Daily News a description of 
Kronstadt 496; faulty though much of its fortifications may be, I'm 
afraid half a dozen screw ships of the line will nevertheless go to 
blazes before it knuckles under. 
The HIGHWAYMEN have been kind enough to return Lupus his 
POCKET-BOOK minus 7 Prussian taler notes. b His philistines mean to 
do something towards making good the loss of his money and his 
watch, and he might even get some smart-money into the bargain. 
Borchardt is attending to his bruises, and so the thing is resolving 
itself.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  29 MARCH  1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
I have not yet acknowledged receipt of the £5, or used the 
money for the intended purpose, or written—all for the same 
reason. I have been saddled with Pieper. Ten days ago he was 
thrown out of his lodgings and I OF COURSE had to take him in here. 
He has drawn a bill on the Union and, if it's not protested, one of 
the next mails from America should bring him the money. This 
week Freiligrath has, BESIDES, found him a German lesson which 
will bring in 15/-  A WEEK. And he was to have secured a similar 
lesson at ABOUT 10/- through Meyer—who has gone back to 
Germany today and asks me to send you his regards. But he didn't 
turn up at the appointed place. Instead, he told Meyer that he was 
fed up with giving lessons. Feels his vocation is to be a writer. Le 
malheureux! b 
There's still much I don't understand about Lupus' adventure.0 
Did it happen in the street? Doubtless after he'd been out on a 
drinking spree with you and Heise! What a DEEP IMPRESSION it made 
on my FAMILY you will gather from the enclosed letter of little 
Laura's, in which she relates the great événement 6 for Jenny and 
Edgar who were at school.

The diplomatic part of Lassalle —aside from the information, 
which is well done—is as bad as his military one. What he says 
about Palmerston is simply the gossip current on the Continent. 49 
Have you read the SECRET CORRESPONDENCE 498? If the ministers who 
conducted it are allowed to conduct the war—as everything seems 
to indicate—the affair can only end in England's utter disgrace, 
although AT ALL INSTANCES the Continent will be thrown into a 
welcome confusion. 
Enclosed an article on the war by Urquhart, of yesterday's date," 
and cuttings from an earlier pamphlet on his military plans. I 
should like your detailed opinion of both. 
One of the Prussian instructors with the Turks, whom I met by 
chance yesterday, says that the Turkish artillery is excellent but 
the army as a whole no more than an ornament, inasmuch as any 
vigorous action has been frustrated by Constantinople. 
In your essay on the Russian RETREAT from Kalafat you say that 
the purpose of this manoeuvre was to set up camp in Odessa, 
having regard to the Anglo-French army. According to the latest 
news,  however, it would seem that the Russians have crossed the 
Danube on the opposite side, or intend to do so. There might be 
some more detailed information to hand tomorrow, in which case 
you could let me have something about it the day after.b In my 
letter of the day before yesterday499 I forbade the Tribune, which 
was really overdoing things, to annex as LEADERS anything except 
military pieces—or else omit my name altogether, since I don't 
want it to appear only beneath indifferent STUFF. For it is 
essential—and now is the moment—to show them by military  pieces 
that they cannot dispense with me. 
If the Times commercial correspondent in Manchester has 
reported aright/ business must be in very poor shape. Serious 
FAILURES are expected down here any day. Likewise in Paris. It goes 
without saying that concerns which have long been laboriously 
staving off bankruptcy will choose the time when war is declared 
to go under with decorum. 
I haven't yet seen your article in The Daily News and have 
certainly not overlooked it!496

bought a destructive device, invented in France and rejected by 
Louis Philippe's government, which continues to burn under

for the rapid and thorough destruction of the Turkish ships. 
According to the Hamburger Correspondent, which must be 
regarded as a semi-Russian organ, Nicholas is to publish further 
documents, among them letters of Prince Albert.

ENGELS TO H. J. LINCOLN, 
EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS 501 
IN LONDON 
[Rough copy] 
7 South Gate, Manchester, 
30 March 1854. St. Mary's 
Sir, 
Perhaps I am not mistaken in supposing that at the present 
moment an offer to contribute to the military department of your 
paper may meet with some favour, even if the party offering his 
services be not, for the moment, an active member of the military 
profession, and though he be a foreigner to boot. 
I suppose the actual qualifications of the party will be the main 
thing. As to these, nothing can show them better than half-a-dozen 
articles upon various military subjects, which you might submit to 
a See this volume, p. 421. - b All yours 

=====第456页=====
424 212. Engels to H.J.Lincoln. 30 March 1854 
any military authority, if you should choose to do so. The higher 
the authority the better. I would ten times sooner be judged by Sir 
William Napier than by a subaltern martinet. 
But I cannot expect you to give me even a trial, unless you 
know something more about nie. I beg to state, therefore, that my 
military school has been the Prussian Artillery, a service which, if 
it is not what it might be, yet has produced the men who made 
'the Turkish Artillery one of the best in Europe' as our friend 
Nicholas has laid it down. Later on, I had an occasion of seeing 
some active service during the insurrectionary war in South 
Germany, 1849. For many years the study of military science in all 
its branches has been one of my chief occupations, and the 
success, which my articles on the Hungarian Campaign, published 
at the time in the German Press, were fortunate enough to obtain, 
encourages me in the belief that I have not studied in vain. An 
acquaintance, more or less familiar, with most European lan­
guages, including Russian, Serbian, and a little Wallachian, opens 
to me the best sources of information and may, perhaps, prove 
useful to you in other respects. How far I am able to write correct 
and fluent English, my articles, of course, themselves must show. 
Any other information respecting myself I shall be happy to give, 
or else you may obtain it from your educational contributor 
Dr Watts whom I have been acquainted with for more than ten 
years. 502 
I have for some time past thought of making you an offer of 
this kind, but, considered the matter hardly worth your while as 
long as war was not actually declared and the whole critique of 
Danubian strategy was confined to profound disquisitions as to 
what share of the blame attaching to the inconceivable proceedings 
in Bulgaria was due to Lord Aberdeen, and what to Omer Pasha. 
Now the matter is different. A local war may be a mere 
simulaerum of a war; an European war must be a reality. Besides 
this, I avow, another reason restrained me. I was not then 
prepared, as I am now, with the necessary maps, plans, and special 
information respecting the theatre of war and the belligerent 
parties, and I should have been sorry to send you a single line 
based upon other than the very best information obtainable. 
My absence, not only from the seat of war, but also (for the 
moment, at least) from your own headquarters circumscribes 
pretty nearly the sort of contributions I could offer you. They 
would confine themselves to descriptions of those portions of the 
theatre of war, where actual hostilities are going on; statements of, 
and observations on, the military organisation, strength, chances, 

=====第457页=====
212. Engels to H.J.Lincoln. 30 March 1854 425 
and possible operations of the belligerent armies; critical remarks 
on actual engagements, and, from time to time, resumes (to use the 
French word) of the operations, say of a month or six weeks, 
according to events. As the fullest information of what has actually 
happened is necessary to form a correct judgment, I should very 
seldom have to write on the strength of mere telegraphic 
dispatches, but have to wait, generally, for the arrival of more 
detailed news; thus the loss of a day or two would be less 
important for my contributions, if that would make them better; 
and therefore my presence in London might, for a time at least, 
be dispensed with. In case you should wish me to extend my 
contributions to a wider circle, I should have no objection and 
await your proposals. 
Should you, however, receive my offer favourably, it may be 
that in a couple of months I should be enabled to come to London 
altogether; in the meantime, I might slip over, if desired, to confer 
with you. 
As to politics, I should mix them up as little as possible with 
military criticism. There is but one good line of policy in war: to 
go at it with the greatest rapidity and energy, to beat your 
opponent, and force him to submit to your terms. If the allied 
governments do this, I should acknowledge it; if they should 
cripple or tie the hands of their commanders, I should speak out 
against it. I do wish the Russians may get a good beating, but if 
they fight well, I am that much of a soldier, that I should give the 
devil his due. For the remainder, I should stick to the principle, 
that military science, like mathematics or geography, has no 
particular political opinion 
Now for positive proposals. I do not expect that the description 
of Kronstadt sent herewith will enable you to form any idea of 
what you may expect from me. But if it should appear to you that 
I may be of some service to your paper, a provisional arrangement 
might be come to, by which you would retain your entire liberty to 
refuse my further collaboration, if found unsuitable, while a fair 
remuneration was guaranteed to me for my labour and expenses. 
For you cannot but know that to write on military operations, 
requires the possession of numerous and expensive maps and 
books, for which due allowance should be made as entering into 
the cost of production. 
Supposing, then, I sent you a series of papers giving a full 
account of the military and naval force of Russia, its organisation, 
actual strength and efficiency (as far as can be ascertained), 
together with a military account of the theatre of war, the lines of

operation and defence on the Baltic, the Black Sea, Danubian and 
Polish frontiers, including the system of fortresses. The enclosed 
Kronstadt article would form one of the series and might be 
postponed till its place arrived. My information upon these 
subjects is, I believe, first-rate, derived exclusively from printed 
(and not from any mysterious) sources. I could furnish an article 
per week, say one or two columns, and more, if required. 
Should you deem this proceeding too systematical, the account 
of Kronstadt might be followed up by a similar one of the 
permanent fortifications of Sevastopol and the other Russian 
fortified harbours (wherever obtainable), to be concluded by some 
observations on the chances of naval attacks against land batteries, 
drawn from history and from the best theoretical sources such as 
Sir Howard Douglas/ 
If you require reviews of military works, I could also undertake 
them. For instance Col. Chesney's Russo-Turkish Campaigns; for 
this book I am, I may say, admirably provided with materials. 
I conclude this lengthy epistle in offering you, also, a few 
remarks on the importance or rather non-importance of the 
Russian passage across the Danube: these are at your service at a 
moment's notice. 
If you take my offer into consideration, I shall be glad to receive 
a few lines as soon as possible so as to be enabled to set to work at 
once.  In the meantime, etc.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
^ Manchester, 3 April 1854 
Dear Marx, 
The crossing of the Danube is of a purely defensive nature. It is 
proof that the Russians are withdrawing from the greater part of 
Wallachia. They have had 7 infantry divisions in Wallachia, one in 
a H. Douglas, A Treatise on Naval Gunnery, London, 1820. 

=====第459页=====

reserve at Ismail and, behind it, Cheodayev's corps, making 3 
more divisions. Cheodayev can, at the very best, be at Jassy. The 
remaining 8 divisions, including cavalry, etc., etc., amount to less 
than 110,000 men. Hence, with the possibility of an Anglo-French 
landing in their rear, it behoves them to secure the most 
favourable position in which they will not be cut off, and with the 
minimum possible sacrifice of ground. Here they had only 2 
alternatives: Either a direct withdrawal to the Sereth, this and the 
Lower Danube being chosen as the line of defence (Fokshani, 
Galatz, Ismail) or, 2. a  DASH  to the Dobrudja, shifting the front to 
Kustendje, Hirsova, Oltenitza and Bucharest, with Trajan's Wall, 
Danube and Argish as the first line of defence, Buseo as the 
second, and Sereth as the third. This, at any rate, is the best plan, 
especially since new ground would be gained on one wing to make 
up for that abandoned on the other, and thus the retreat would 
look like an advance, and military decorum would be preserved. 
Possession of the Dobrudja would shorten the Russian front and, 
if the worst came to the worst, would leave open the line of 
withdrawal to Chotin on the Dniester, even if there were landings 
at Akkerman or Odessa. 503 
Things seem to be working out with The Daily News. I didn't 
write until last week,3 after I had observed the English proprieties 
by obtaining a REFERENCE from father Watts, who also writes for it 
(father Watts,  BY  THE BY, has given up his SHOP and is now MANAGING 
DIRECTOR of a PEOPLES PROVIDENT  ASSURANCE  CO. in which capacity he will 
shortly be setting himself up in your vicinity, 47 Charing Cross 
[Road].  He and all his officials are letting their beards grow and 
look like Wasserpolacken604). Today I've had a letter from the CHIEF 
EDITOR, Lincoln, who seems altogether agreeable (I had offered to 
start off with articles on the Russian army, navy and fortifications), 
and he is eager for me to send him the articles.505 So I don't feel 
at all nervous. That the fellows are in a quandary as regards 
things military is evident from their acceptance of Schimmelpfen-
nigian nonsense of a kind totally incomprehensible to anyone 
unacquainted with Billow's books, and my racily written and 
unlaboured letter will have opened up for them prospects of quite 
a different order. Once they have got interested in my stuff (N.B. 
I asked for money straight away), I intend really to impress the 
jackasses. Tomorrow I shall send them something no one else can 
provide: plans of Hirsova, Matchin, Isaktsha and Tultsha. This 
business has really taken a load off my mind, for a source of cash

was absolutely  necessary.  If all goes  well,  in the summer, when my old 
man comes over, I shall chuck up commerce and move to London; 
but then I shall at any rate be coming over some time before 
Whitsun to make definite arrangements with the chaps. 
Needless to say, Lupus had been out drinking with us. As usual, 
staggers off tight as a drum so that there's no holding him, loses 
his way, finds himself in a low pub at the opposite end of the town 
from where he lives. Treats 6 maquereaux 3 and 2 whores who were 
at the bar, shows his shekels, exits followed by the maquereaux, and 
so on. That's his  ACCOUNT.  However, there's more to the matter than 
meets the eye; for instance, on coming to his senses he didn't go 
home but went off with an Englishman, a total stranger, who put 
him up (not 200 paces from his lodgings) moyennant one shilling. 
In short, il y a là des choses que M. Lupus veut cacher, sans doute 
quelque vieille fille? 
The story of the Russians' boulets asphyxiants 0 is nonsense. The 
French have something of the kind, but it doesn't destroy ships, 
merely kills people. You might send me Hammer some time, 
particularly about the more recent times. About Urquhart one of 
these days. It's bad luck about Pieper. As regards the money you 
can, of course, dispose of it as you please. / don't give a damn

^ [28 Dean Street, Soho] 
Dear Engels, 
From Cluss' letter, enclosed herewith,506  you will see what a 
worthy trick has been played on him by Dr Kellner and friend 
Weydemeyer. The latter, instead of enlightening him as to the 
a pimps - b at a charge of - c there are things here that Mr Lupus wants to hide,

status  quo, has got him  into  a pretty  fix, a  service which friend 
Weydemeyer regularly performs  for his  friends. 
I am  delighted about  The  Daily News.  I shall have  a look today 
and see if they've published anything yet. I  HOPE.  SIR.  YOU  WILL  LEAVE 
MANCHESTER,  SIR,  FOR EVER. SIR.  One  gets horribly used  to this  SIR (or 
rather SAR!) when  one is  compelled  to read  the  parliamentary 
debates each week, especially  THE  SPEECHES  OF Lord John Russell.  The 
fellow  can be  boiled down  to just  the 2  words:  'Now,  SAR!' 
As you  will see  from  the  enclosed, Pieper  has received  his  first 
bill from Washington,  and  yesterday evening again acquired 
lodgings  of his own. He now  struts around like  a turkeycock.  Not 
only earns money,  but as an  author,  and not  only  as an  author, 
but as a  politician!  For the  time being  he has, or at  least pretends 
to have, forsworn London's public  PETTICOATS  and is on the  look-out 
for some healthy paramour. Social standing  no object.  Nor yet, 
perhaps,  age. But  health. THAT  IS THE THING. Experience  has  taught 
the good youth  to regard  the sex  from  a medical point  of view. 
Depicted  in a  state  of undress,  the  good youth might serve  as a 
cautionary example.  Now  that  he's  under  his own  steam again,  I 
have told  him  about your offer  to help  him  should  he get a 
negative answer  or a  protested bill from Weydemeyer. There 
could  no longer  be any  harm  in giving  him  your message,  but the 
good youth  who, all  things considered,  is bon garçon,"  was deeply 
impressed. 
At this particular juncture, just when  you  have opened fire  in 
The Daily News,  it is  vital  you  shouldn't leave  me in the  lurch over 
the Tribune. Otherwise  the  fellows, nettled  as they  are by my 
recent statement,b  and  likewise readers  of The  Daily News, might 
well believe that now—when  all the  newspapers  are  anxious  to 
make  a splash with their military stuff—I  am  selling THE BETTER PART 
OF MYSELF  in London  and the  OFFAL  in New  York.  The  fellows would 
be capable  of chucking  me out,  seeing that they already have  one 
correspondent here  and one in  Liverpool. Their paper would  be 
somewhat  the  worse  for it, but  £200  to the  good which, after  all, is 
worth  the  trouble. Hence what  is necessary above  all is to  tempt 
them once more into printing  a military article  as a  LEADER. Then  I 
can again  be  sure  of them.  In one of its  • recent issues  the 
N. Y.  Herald ridicules  the  'MILITARY EDITOR  OF THE  TRIBUNE'  for 
prescribing  a plan  of campaign  for  Omer Pasha  and  crying 
treason  now  that  it is not  carried  out.

consists of two epochs. In the first, Washington Wilks has most 
blatantly and stupidly cribbed from my articles in the Tribune.* 
The second is a longer version of the chapter on Hungary from 
Urquhart's Progress of Russia, padded out with the help of 'Blue 
Books'. Wretched though the concoction is and betraying at every 
turn the fellow's total lack of knowledge—true plagiarist's 
ignorance—it has nevertheless enabled him to shoulder his way 
into the London MEETINGS, to gain the protection of Urquhart and 
his clique and to set himself up in London as a 'PUBLIC CHARACTER'. 
The idea of 'betrayal' by the Ministry is beginning to spread 
among the philistines here and, if the fellows venture to play the 
same game as in 1840 and  '46,507  there may be trouble.

Dear Lassalle, 
Your letter of 7 March safely received. I should like to make a 
few comments, firstly on your military, and secondly on your 
diplomatic, VIEWS. 
ad 1. To my comment508 regarding Enos and Rodosto, you 
reply—agreeing in this with the English ministerial papers—that Printed according to the original

Constantinople must be protected.a If the two fleets in the Black 
Sea and the Army of the Danube cannot protect it, then neither 
can 100,000 French and English. I do not, of course, deny that, if 
they are to be launched against Sevastopol or Odessa, they are 
closer to hand at Rodosto than in Malta or Toulon. 
The notion that a move into Serbia would place the Austrians 
'in the rear of the Turkish Army of the Danube' does not seem to 
me quite correct. The Austrians must make their crossing at 
Belgrade or not very far below it, or else enter Wallachia via 
Mehadia along the left bank of the Danube. In the first case they 
would find themselves in the extension of the Turkish left wing, in 
the second to the front of it. That this would mean the immediate 
sacrifice of Kalafat and Vidin, with the exception of the garrison 
which would remain there, is evident—but not that this Turkish left 
wing would be lost and its remnants compelled to fall back on the 
Shumla line. Au contraire? the correct tactics for the Austrians would 
be to march immediately on Sofia via Nissa, hence the correct tactics 
for the Turks would be to withdraw from Vidin, likewise to Sofia. 
Not having so far to go, they would be there  before  the Austrians and 
could either make a stand in the Balkans or withdraw towards 
Adrianople. 
Should the Austrians allow themselves to be enticed into 
marching on Vidin, the Turks would still make for Sofia. This 
division of Omer Pasha's principal corps would not involve the 
fragmentation of his forces, since the new enemy would necessitate 
a new Adrianople-Sofia-Belgrade-Vidin operational line. Thus the 
Turkish left wing would become an independent army. 
Should the strategy you postulate be adopted in spite of all this, 
no amount of falling back on the Shumla line would avail, for the 
latteV, having already been outflanked as a result of the sacrifice of 
the highway from Belgrade to Constantinople, would have to be 
\ abandoned all the more precipitately in order to assemble all 
available reserves at Adrianople and advance against the first enemy 
to pass through the Balkans.

Russian agent I came to this conclusion after the most conscienti­
ous and painstaking scrutiny of the whole of his career and, 
indeed, of the 'Blue Books', the 'Parliamentary Debates' and the 
pronouncements of his own diplomatic agents.5 Though far from 
amusing and very time-consuming to boot, the work has proved 
rewarding in so far as it provides the key to the secret diplomatic 
history of the past 30 years.—(En passant. Some of my Tribune 
articles on Palmerston have again been reprinted in London as 
separate pamphlets in 50,000 copies.465) 
Palmerston is no genius, a genius would not lend himself to 
such a role. But he is a most talented man and a consummate 
tactician. His artistry does not lie in serving Russia, but rather in 
contriving to maintain the role of a 'TRULY ENGLISH MINISTER' while so 
engaged. The only difference between him and Aberdeen is that 
Aberdeen serves Russia because he doesn't understand her, while 
Palmerston serves her although he does. Hence the first is Russia's 
avowed partisan, the second her secret agent, the first gratis, the 
second in return for fees received. Even if he himself now wished 
to do so, he could not turn against Russia because he is at her 
mercy and must live in constant fear of being immolated in 
Petersburg. This is the man who in 1829 condemned Aberdeen's 
policy as not pro-Russian enough,3 who was told by Robert Peel in 
the House of Commonsb that he didn't know whose representative 
he was, who sacrificed the Poles in 1831, who imposed the Treaty 
of Unkiar-Skelessi on the Porte in  1833, 510 who abandoned the

28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
In Cluss' letter, enclosed herewith, you will note on the one 
hand Schimmelpfennig's admiration of your military stuff—for 
which I am given the credit; on the other, his crafty critical 
reservations.51 
Should today's report (in The Times) from Gorchakov and the 
report in the Northern Bee* on the manoeuvres on the Circassian 
coast515 give you occasion to send me a LETTER for the Tribune, you 
might drop a few anonymous remarks about Schimmelpfennig's 
opinion which, by the by, is commanding much attention. 
What is the significance of The Times suddenly ceasing its attacks 
on the ministry (quant à la guerre 0)} 
You will see from the American newspaper cuttings that for 
six months the 'Central Committee'103 —of this I received 
private confirmation yesterday—had had a considerable amount of 
money at its disposal. The letter from Karger —Ledru's famulus— 
in the Pionier shows how Ledru, and with him the entire orthodox 
emigration, are deceiving themselves as to the significance and 
future prospects of this same Ledru. He and the Germans have 
agreed that as soon as he is Great Khan of France, he will order a

Dear Marx, 
It's all off with The Daily News 501 and, in fact, I have grounds 
for assuming that, by his indiscretion. Monsieur Pieper has played 
me a dirty trick which I shall not forget in a hurry. Everything was 
ALL RIGHT, only the fee to be settled, my article b already set up in 
print—I have the proof copy in my pocket. As long ago as a week 
last Wednesday I wrote to the fellows saying I would accept their

usual terms, and today the answer finally arrives saying that the 
articles are TOO PROFESSIONAL, that, much as they would like to, they 
cannot use them and concluding very politely with an offer of two 
guineas for my TROUBLE and the good advice that I should 
approach a MILITARY  PAPER.  Needless to say, I shall accept neither. 516 
I can think of only one explanation for this strange behaviour: 
Pieper who, to judge by a foolish letter he wrote me a week ago, 517 
knew about the thing, must have been talking big about it and 
thus,  by the well-known telegraphic medium of emigre gossip, the 
story came to the ears of Kinkel or some other wretched German 
blighter acquainted with The Daily News and then, of course, 
nothing was easier than to represent Engels, the MILITARY  MAN, as no 
more than a former one-year volunteer, a communist and a clerk 
by trade, thus putting a stop to everything. The politeness of the 
refus" was not for my benefit, of course, but Watts's. The way the 
letter is written does not preclude my applying again, but only to 
be relegated  to the  PENNY-A-LINERS. 
I should be greatly obliged if you could find out who let the cat 
out of the bag; needless to say, Mr Schimmelpfennig's eulogiesb 
are a poor SETOFF for this échec. c 
On top of that, the shilly-shallying of the Daily News chaps has 
meant that in the meantime some of my sources here have become 
known through the German press—the Moltke,d which I have 
found enormously helpful, is now scarcely any good to me at all 
and in a fortnight all the rest will have gone the same way, and I 
wouldn't dream of risking another £5 on the thing  ON SPECULATION. 
I feel very much inclined to finish the articles on Russian 
military power and send them to The Times. If they published 
them, what an ass The Daily News would look! But a second échec 
would have its drawbacks, for then I should look a complete ass. 
That's why it's so damnable my not being in London, when 
everything would be perfectly simple. What do you think? Write at 
once and let me know. e 
About the other things in a day or two. I can't let you have the 
article on the Russian bulletin' before the next sailing; it needs to 
be closely studied and compared with the map, otherwise one risks 
making an ass of oneself here as well. 
If only you could screw more money out of the Tribune, I'd turn 
my back on the whole, rotten English press, where blackguardly 
German interlopers persuade stupid editors to reject the best

paper518 proves that he, too, has connections. Is there any other 
German officer in London who might be in collusion with the 
paper? 
Before approaching another newspaper I shall get some more 
material together, which will, mean a delay of perhaps 3 weeks. 
N'importe* the better the stuff I have, the better my chances and, 
after all, the material will still be there for the Tribune. 
If I weren't so damnably stuck for cash, I'd invite you up here. 
But just now it's not possible and I must first move into PRIVATE 
LODGINGS again. Had there been a prospect of clinching matters with 
The Daily News, I had intended to come to London for 
Whitsuntide but now the journey would have little point. 
N'importe, perhaps I shall come all the same. 
What with the war, innumerable military works to be studied, 
sundry drinking bouts, etc., etc., I have of late fallen very much 
behind with my work at the office and, precisely because my mind 
was full of other things, have perpetrated a mass of blunders, all 
of which end up in goods being refused and other disasters. I 
shall now have to make up for this, for the very good reason that 
my old man is coming over in 3 months time; moreover I have 
been very remiss about corresponding with him; he's still waiting 
for things he should have had six months ago. I am now having to 
make up for all this, which means a great deal of effort. However 
I believe that a fortnight's hard labour in the office will see me 
through. 
Let me have the newspaper cuttings; without them, Cluss' letter 
is incomprehensible.1" 
Bangya will be sending the Russians some fine reports from 
Erzerum. I wish the Prussians would finally go ahead and declare 
war on England, in which case the farce would be in full swing 
and my old man would not come over. I have neglected him 
horribly and in any case the financial aspect has all the makings of 
a row. 
Enclosed the proof of the Daily News article.0 Let me have it 
back soon. I'm very glad I've got the thing; the fellows won't be 
able to make a splash with it now.

MARX TO ENGELS 234 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 22 April 1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
Pieper, at any rate, is not to blame for the business with The 
Daily News? because he has had absolutely nothing to do with the 
émigrés for the past six months. Blind is CONNECTED WITH THE 
Advertiser, not The Daily News. Herzen's crew— Krapülinski Wor-
cell, b and the blackguardly Golovin—have been positivement 
connected with the D. N. ever since Urquhart's influence got them 
thrown out of the Advertiser. Mr O. von Wenckstern has 
transferred from The Times to the D.N., but is no longer in 
London, that JUDICIOUS PAPER having sent him as MILITARY 
COMMISSIONER  to Omer Pasha. The belletristic blighter! It's more 
than likely that the fellow has introduced other German black­
guards out there. However it is the Russians I chiefly suspect. So 
WISELY  MANAGED  is The Daily News that, as is shown by the last RETURN 
of newspaper stamps, its sales have plummeted since 1851 and it 
now ranks after the Herald in the newspaper hierarchy. 
I consider that you should immediately send the articled to The 
Times as it stands and without waiting for one scrap of additional

material (I shall see if the 'Bericht über die Kriegs-operationen' 3 
is available here). The Times will still be short of material next 
week since the parliamentary recess, though supposed to end on 
27 April, will not be over until 1 May. Hence it will be glad of 
anything it can get and, since the people there possess far more 
literary and political tact than the bunglers on the D.N. and 
would be prepared to accept an article from the devil himself if it 
were interesting enough, I fermement believe that they would 
publish it at once. At the same time it would be your REVENGE on 
the other rag. But should your approach to The Times misfire— 
which I doubt—you may be sure that 1. nobody will hear of it, 
since I shan't tell a soul; 2. the reviews will be sure to take it. 
Finally, I would again advise you not to wait, but to send this first 
article quite unchanged to The Times. 
As for Schimmelpfennig, 0 I think it would be doing the chap too 
great an honour to deal with him in the Tribune. I suggest that, in 
one of your private letters to me, you let me have sufficient to 
pass on to Cluss for an article in the Reform. 
Of late the Tribune has again been appropriating all my articles 
as LEADERS and putting my name to nothing but rubbish. It has 
appropriated, for example, a detailed account of Austrian 
finances,*1 an article on the Greek insurrection,e  etc. On top of that 
their now 'congenital' habit of making a splash with your military 
stuff.  I positivement intend—as soon as Dana has replied to my last 
admonition 819—to ask for a higher fee, citing in particular the 
EXPENSES incurred in respect of the military articles. Don't you 
agree? The fellows ought to pay at least £3 per article. They lay 
out £500 on sending Taylor to India, and the chap's reports from 
there are worse and shorter—what could he get to know about a 
country like that on a quick  TRIP?—than  my own sent them from 
here on the same subject.520 £3 per article would enable me to get 
out of the mire at last. 
There's been an odd business with Urquhart—whom, by the by, 
I have never once met in London since our first entrevue. 1 The 
ministerial Globe published on SATURDAY* [a]  FURIOUS  ONSLAUGHT  ON HIM, 
saying amongst other things that, while he might pick up converts

* 'Where is Mr Anstey? Where Mr Monteith etc. and where that Goliath of the new 
revolution, Mr Marx?' 'All these gentlemen have seen the folly of their ways, and 
returned to the habits of good society.'* 
Then, in Thursday's issue of The Morning Advertiser, 'AN 
URQUHARTITE' declares that: 
* 'If continuing to pose implicit confidence in Mr Urquhart's views be proof of 
folly these individuals have certainly not recovered their reason, and also must still be 
without the pale of good society.'* 
And then proceeds to specify: 
* 'Mr Marx, however, I am happy to say, is as energetic and valuable [a] supporter 
as ever of Mr Urquhart's.'*3 
So far I've done nothing about this, but am biding my time. An 
opportunity will present itself for disowning Mr Urquhart.I find it 
all the more outrageous as he knows, since I have told him so, that 
I agree with him in nothing save the matter of Palmerston, and on 
that point it wasn't he who showed me the way. Mais il faut 
attendre}"  But there is one difficulty. There is a very stupid 
Urquhartite by the name of Marx, c not the one meant by the 
Globe. If I publicly disown Urquhart, he'll say he didn't mean me, 
but the other Marx. Incidentally, it is evident from the Globe that 
Mr Palmerston has been paying me the greatest attention. 
Pieper grows more vapidly complacent every day. Such is his 
mopping and mowing that his face is more criss-crossed with lines 
than a map of both the Indies. Old Malvolio! Little Jenny always 
refers to him now as Prince Charming, the son of Wunderhorn. d 
In my next I shall tell you some comical tales about 'Prince 
Charming' who, as his sister's letters reveal, regards himself as 
Byron and Leibniz rolled into one.

Dear Marx, 
It's absolutely impossible to do the things for The Times until I 
have more material, i. e. in a week or fortnight. I shall then finish 
them off straight away. 
As regards Schimmelpfennig,a  I shall write something with 
Heise. The thing must be done in such a way that the fellow can't 
reply, hence very accurately or not at all. 
Something must be done about Heise; matters cannot continue 
very much longer as they are. So I am writing to Cluss today, 521 
asking him to tell me whether he can put Heise in touch with an 
Anglo-American paper—the fellow writes passable English—and 
2. whether the Reform could pay him. Both of these on condition 
that Eccarius will not suffer as a result, for he, after all, has first 
claim. I have informed Cluss that if there is any objection of this 
kind you will advise him by next Tuesday's STEAMER. At the same 
time I notified Cluss of the Schimmelpfennig article, so that they 
don't do anything stupid in New York. 
I can't write another word today.

Dear Engels, 
A few days before Heise left I had a scene with him in the 
presence of others over 'The Knight of the Noble Consciousness'. 
He came out against us as the Knight's a steadfast (secret) 
supporter or  AT LEAST  as a venomous  INDEPENDENT.  The affair brewed 
up into a scandal. I thought it unnecessary to write to you about it 
1. because you knew Heise well enough, 2. because he wrote to 
me, humbly asking to be recommended to you and I didn't want 
to give him a letter of Uriah. b 
The man may, of course, have come over to us altogether, 
though I cannot regard his attaching himself to us when in need 
as proof of this. At all events, I feel that you, for your part, 
shouldn't get too deeply involved with Heise. Temper your trust 
in him and above all do not write anything jointly with the lad. 
Before he can be co-opted and thus 'set up' in the eyes of the 
public, MORE  PROOFS  OF HIS  SINCERITY  ARE WANTED.  We have had too many 
beastly experiences not to have become cautious and tant soit peu c 
mistrustful.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 1 May 1854 
Dear Marx, 
The business of Heise is really rather disastrous. 11 If the chap 
had behaved dubiously in regard to party matters, you might at 
least have let me know. As it was, I could only suppose that, for a 
new convert, he was PERFECTLY  SAFE.  I hadn't met him before, except 
for a couple of days in the Palatinate; seeing him in London as 
part of the intimate circle and, like Meyer, apparently a special 
favourite of yours, I naturally concluded that the fellow had 
already done penance down there, had undergone his épreuves h 
and earned your good graces. Hitherto I have treated him 
accordingly and, since he had nothing to do and is in other ways a 
cheerful sort of chap, I've been going round with him more than 
with anyone else.Moreover,now that the philistines have got to know 
that I'm living with Maryc and this has got to stop, I have taken 
lodgings  NEXT  DOOR TO HIM,  though I haven't yet moved in. Well, all 
this is exceedingly difficult to set right now, and I can see only one 
way of doing it: from your letter I can only conclude that you 
gave him a letter for me. This I have not received? Write to me at 
once so that I can question him about it. 
There were two reasons why I did the Schimmelpfennig article 
with him 524: 1. because I wanted the fellow to be given a 
dressing-down without myself appearing to be working for the 
Reform, 2. because it was absolutely essential that Heise be given 
something to do to get him out of his indolent ways. The article is 
very good and, though marred here and there by Heise's style, 
gives Mr Schimmelpfennig some rough treatment. The thing can 
be of no further benefit to Heise, for he'll never be able to write 
another article of the kind; on the other hand, the business greatly 
impressed him by showing him how surely and on what a firm 
'basis'  we operate. However, even this wouldn't have happened 
had I been informed, and at least the fellow wouldn't have cost me 
so much; as it is, I have him round my neck and, au bout du

compte* am more or less responsible for his household debts, etc., 
etc. 
As regards my visit to London, it seems very questionable. I 
have far too much to do at the office to be able to get away easily. 
However, if all had gone well with The Daily News, I had indeed 
intended to come down and clinch the thing by word of mouth. 
That reason no longer obtains and, since the thing would cost me 
some £7-£8, which I can ill afford and I could only stay down 
there 3-4 days at the most, I shan't come if I can help it. 
After Cluss' letter, returned herewith, I shall now send him the 
article on Schimmelpfennig to be used as circumstances dictate; if 
he has already become too involved with Schimmelpfennig,525  it 
will at least serve to enlighten Cluss privately concerning 
Schimmelpfennig and at the same time help him not to become 
too deeply involved. As a soldier, give me Willich any day, rather 
than that clever-clever Schimmelpfennig who really has nothing to 
him except sheer vanity and arrogance, and whose entire stock of 
learning derives from a few common or garden manuals and 
textbooks. 
I shall let you have another article on Turkey, military or 
otherwise,0 for next Friday's"1 STEAMER. It is time we harked back to 
our first articles on the subject," including the political aspect. 
Here, too, we have been splendidly vindicated by circumstances; 
the pertinacity of the Greek insurrection487  and the evident 
uneasiness of the Turks in Bulgaria prove, après tout/ that the 
Christian population is starting to bestir itself and that the Turkish 
Empire is rapidly approaching its end. On the other hand it is 
symptomatic of the Turks' great weakness that the larger part of 
their army, as was always its wont, ran away home during the 
winter and that as yet no amount of reform has succeeded in 
instilling in these fellows a soldierly spirit on the European 
pattern. As regards the Odessa business we shall have to have 
some more detailed news; up till now everything has been too 
contradictory. Lupus is fuming at the allies for not having cut the 
Russians to pieces ad majorem gloriam Aberdeeni et Bonapartiß He 
and Heise now vie with each other in dismaying the philistines

which made the philistines laugh and provided the opportunity 
for a dignified retreat. 
Heise, by the way, won't ever be dangerous, his writing ability is 
far inferior to little Dronke's, idleness is his speciality. No 
knowledge whatever, only a strong inclination to acquire the ABC 
of everything. With great difficulty he succeeded in learning the

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 May 1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
My use of the term 'letter of Uriah'b  has caused a misunder­
standing. I gave Heise no letter—he didn't even take his leave of 
me and was, incidentally, in far too tipsy a condition to do so. He 
wrote to me from the hole where he was lodging near Manchester, 
asking for my help up there. It was in this sense that I would have 
regarded sending you a report on him as a 'letter of Uriah', if in a 
somewhat 'bolder' meaning of the term. Maybe Manchester has 
deprived him of the main INCITEMENT of making himself out to be a 
'GREAT MAN', an 'INDEPENDENT' and a 'MALCONTENT' in the eyes of 
a Certain that God has him in his safe keeping—let him have him. - ,J See this

Imandt  and  Schily. However,  all you can do now is to act 
diplomatically  and  urge  the man  gradually  to find himself  an 
occupation.  The  whole time  he has  been  in England  he has  been 
living  at other people's expense  and,  whenever  he got a  chance  of 
earning  his  keep, soon gave  it up.  Since  he now has a  superfluity 
of time  on his  hands  he might  at least write regularly  for the 
Reform which,  by the by, has as yet  failed  to pay  even Eccarius  so 
much  as a  FARTHING. However,  if given enough support,  it should 
soon  be in a  position  to pay. 
Your military things—'retreat  of the  Russians from Kalafat'  and 
the situation  in the  Dobrudjaa have,  I think, been proved 
splendidly right.  The  bombardment  of Odessa527  was, it  seems, 
provoked  by the  Russians. Unless  the  English land troops there, 
little would appear  to have been achieved—save  to placate  the 
bourgeois here  who,  inasmuch  as the war is  manifesting itself  in 
the form  of taxes  and  loans,  are becoming wild about  the  inactivity 
of the  ALLIED FLEETS,—PERHAPS,  too, Nicholas needed a demonstration 
of the  kind  to give spice  to his  appeal  'to his  people'.b There  can 
no longer  be any  doubt about collusion between  the  Ministry here 
and Petersburg,  now  that  the  suppression  of a  document  in the 
'SECRET  CORRESPONDENCE'—in which Aberdeen (1844) accepted  the 
Russian proposals—has become common knowledge.  I already 
had an inkling that something  of the  sort was  going  on behind  the 
scenes because  of the  falsification  of the  dates  and  endorsements 
in the 'memorandum'c alluded to in the  HOUSE OF LORDS  by the 
Tories' EX-FOREIGN MINISTER.*1  Although  the  Journal  de Saint-
Pétersbourg itself censures these fellows  for their fausse  position,*  it is 
clear from  the  'DECLARATIONS  IN COUNCIL' f concerning neutral, 
and especially Russian, shipping, that they  are  still agree­
ing their moves with Russia. Similar DECLARATIONS- appeared  at 
the same time  in St  Petersburg,528 ALMOST COUCHED  IN THE  SAME  TERMS. 
Such  a thing can't  be a  coincidence.  The  element they overlooked 
in their calculations  is Bonaparte.  No  matter what sort  of a  chap

he may be, the  question  is one of  life and  death  for him and, 
being  a rogue  by profession,  he won't allow himself  to be  duped  as 
was POOR Louis Philippe  in 1839 and  1840.529 When  one  reads  the 
secret documents  of 1830-48,  one is  left in no  doubt that England 
deposed Louis Philippe  and  that  the  worthy National, despite  and 
because  of its  blind Anglophobia,  was  unwittingly  the  principal 
tool of precisely English policy. 
As you  know,  the  Tribune prides itself  on being Christian.  I was 
all the  more tickled when  the  fellows used  for a  LEADER  an article  of 
mine  in which  one of the  chief things  I held against  the  Turks  was 
the fact  of their having preserved Christianity/ although  I did not 
of course  say so  quite  so bluntly. INDEED,  one  reason  why the  Turks 
are bound  to come  to grief  is that they have allowed Byzantine 
theocracy  to develop  in a way  that  not  even  the  Greek emperors 
would have dreamed  of.  There  are, in  effect, only  2 religious 
peoples left,  the  Turks  and the  Greco-Slav population  of Turkey. 
Both  are  doomed,  or at  least  the  latter, along with  the  clerically 
ordered society which  has  been consolidated under Turkish rule. 
I have, besides, sent  the  Tribune  a scandalous story about  the 
'Holy Sepulchre'  and the  'Protectorate'  in Turkey,b  in whk!h  the 
historical matter will blind  the  fellows  to the  prank  I play  on 
Christianity. 
I should  be very glad  if you  could supply  me  with something  for 
the Tribune,c since  I am  very busy studying  the  history  of the New 
Greek Empire including King Otto,530  but it  will  be a  couple  of 
weeks, perhaps, before  I can  present  the  result  in a  series  of 
articles. Metaxas,  who was  Greek ambassador  in Constantinople 
where  he engaged  in plotting—the Paris Presse published  a pretty 
account  of this Russo-Greek Bangyanade—was  the  principal tool 
of the  INFAMOUS  Capodistria. 531 
At odd  moments  I am  going  in for  Spanish. Have begun with 
Calderôn from whose Magico prodigioso—the Catholic Faustus— 
Goethe drew  not  just  a passage here  or there  but  whole settings 
for some  of scenes  in his  Faust. Then—horribile dictu A—I am 
reading  in  Spanish what  I'd  found impossible  in  French, 
Chateaubriand's Atala  and  René,  and some stuff  by Bernardin  de 
St-Pierre.  Am now in the  middle  of Don  Quixote.  I find that  a 
dictionary  is more necessary  in Spanish than  in Italian  at the  start.

By chance I have got hold of the Archivio triennale délie cose 
d'ltalia dall'avvenimento di Pio IX all'abbandono di Venezia etc. It's 
the best thing about the Italian revolutionary party that I have read. 
Consists of a collection of secret and public documents, intercepted 
letters, etc. Nicely put together. Palmistone (as Thiers pronounces 
Palmerston) plays a leading role here as well. The fellow's 
machinations have been ubiquitous, and at all events his existence 
has been a very amusing one. 
You still owe me a letter about Mr Urquhart's military  stuff. 3 
The man can be caught out only in the 'positive'  SCIENCES.  I.e. here 
and in his economics, the superficiality of which can likewise be 
tangibly demonstrated.

Dear Engels, 
Unfortunately your 'DISPATCH'C did not arrive yesterday until the 
post office had closed, and the LETTER could not be sent to New 
York even against payment of the customary shilling. 
The Pole Miskowsky—vide the 'Knight of the Noble'—has come 
to a very bad end. The poor devil had long been in the most 
wretched circumstances, had never succeeded in raising the 
wherewithal for the trip to  Constantinople—AS  HE WAS  NOT  ONE OF THE 
'MINIONS'  OF THE  'GOVERNOR" 1—and had thus sunk to being a lumpen-
proletarian in Whitechapel to whom we in the  WEST  END  FROM  TIME  TO 
TIME sent some small aid. A few days ago the pauvre diable, e

together with six other refugees, was burned alive in the wooden 
shack he occupied with them in Whitechapel.532 First you're 
reduced to beggary, then you starve, and finally you're burnt to 
death; what more can you expect in this 'best of worlds'/ 
Since Wiss, Doctor of Universal Wisdom, had launched in the 
Republik der Arbeiter  A FURIOUS ONSLAUGHT on our 'corrupt ideas' and 
mindless 'frivolity', b I thought it fitting to obtain from Edgar 
Bauer, whom I see from time to time— a rendez-vous invariably 
followed by a hangover—some information on this lumen mundi, c 
now a shareholder in Weitling's stables of bliss. Briefly, this is what 
I learned there: 
Mr Wiss apparently arrived in Berlin shortly after your time.533 
He was a vain youth with a marked aversion for 'POSITIVE' 
knowledge, which is why he never succeeded in passing his 
medical examinations and threw himself passionately into the 
universal wisdom which was concentrated in Stehely's.534 Initially a 
Brunoistd and then a Stirnerian, he became a member of Edgar 
Bauer's society of 'The Free',535  was much interested in the 
emancipation of women, and resolved to become 'frivolous'. In 
pursuance of this aim he tumbled the landlady with whom he 
lodged—a midwife. The midwife then set to work on the 
'frivolous' one's conscience, bemoaning the loss of her 'LESSER 
WALLACHIA' which damage Wiss, le bonhomme, e helped make good by 
cohabiting with her in 'free' marriage. Much though she esteemed 
Mr Wiss' money-bag, the midwife thought no less highly of the 
'natural' bag of a certain working man, a lusty mechanic who 
lodged in the same house. Here again the great Wiss helped make 
good the damage by permitting the working man to work the 
machinery while reserving for himself the pleasure of ennobling 
the resulting product with the name of 'Proudhon-Fourier Wiss' 
and, whenever the name Proudhon was mentioned in the society 
of The Free, it was not the one in Paris they meant but the 
mechanic's OFFSPRING christened by Wiss. 
Since Mr Wiss spent a great deal of money, learned nothing, 
and extolled free marriage, his worthy papa ceased to honour his 
bills,  after which he lived on minor literature à la Meyen and 
loans made to him on his ' espérances' f by philanthropists in Berlin. 
Came the revolution. Wiss became a popular orator, and one of 
the vice-chairmen of the democratic club, helped in by 
a Voltaire, Candide. - b E. Wiß, 'Die elementaren Richtungen der Zeit', Republik der

Edgar Bauer. Next he became a contributor to the Reform but 
so dim was his light that even Ruge hid it under a bushel. Au bout 
du compte 1 Wiss hastily assumed an 'ironical attitude' to the 
revolution, married his midwife in bourgeois-ecclesial fashion, 
made things up with his old man and, together with midwife and 
Proudhon-Fourier Wiss, departed with his tail between his legs for 
America where he is prospering as a doctor, philosopher and 
member of the communia.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 9 May 1854 
Dear Marx, 
I cannot understand the late arrival of the Tribune article.15 The 
letter was specially entrusted to the messenger-boy, who took it to 
the post at a quarter past 7, at the same time as the business letters, all 
of which arrived punctually. Even if it had not left until the 2nd 
post, it should have been in your hands by 2 o'clock at the latest. I 
can only regard it as evidence of Mr Palmerston's solicitude for 
you. Since the bit about the battle has not materialised in the 
meantime, I can- only hope you haven't sent off the article. 
With regard to Urquhart's military  stuff, c something in my next. 
I can, of course, deal with this subject only in notes, which I shall 
write straight off in English for you. You will then have to work 
them into your article. 
The story of Dr Wiss is most edifying and Cluss will certainly 
ensure that it reaches the right people.

after all that he ultimately 'vanished without trace'.53 When I read 
the story in the London papers, it immediately struck me that 
those who had been burnt to death were most certainly 
refugees.532 
If at all possible, I shall set Heise to work—which, indeed, he 
cannot possibly avoid the moment I begin to hold off. The fellow's 
presently in Bradford, whither he was summoned by the little 
man 2 during the absence of the latter's principalb and whence, in 
any case, he returns in an exceedingly tipsy condition, so that he 
has to spend a few days in quarantine before he's good for 
anything. I was much tickled by the little man's little article0 
because of the care with which he retrieves and repeats all the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitungs old chestnuts about Schleswig-Holstein, 
Belgium,* 1 etc., etc. 
Feldzug der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Armee und Marine 1850, by 
A. Liitgen, sometime Major, is the first sensible and comprehen­
sive book about the Willisen episode. It confirms everything I had 
already deduced from preliminary studies of the affaire Monsieur 
Willisen's original plan was a very good one,—if somewhat 
over-extended—so good that even the botched and belated 
attempt to revert to it instilled thoughts of withdrawal in the 
minds of the Danes, who were 36,000 strong against 26,000, 
almost all of their troops being already committed, whereas the 
Schleswig-Holsteiners had certainly '/s of their troops still uncom­
mitted. But when Monsieur Willisen actually found himself face to 
face with the enemy, he lost his head amidst the contradictory 
reports and the even more confused suggestions that were being 
made to him. Even the night before the battle, he detached his 
own reserves to a point on the left, right off the battle-field, to 
face an imaginary enemy and at the same time deferred the order 
for the attack, upon which all the dispositions had been based. 
Thus,  concentration of reserves on the left where no enemy 
existed, exposure of the centre, which received the main attack, 
confusion on the right wing, which was to launch the main 
counter-attack. This alone is enough to explain the outcome, and 
even then he might have emerged victorious had he not too

hastily—as early as 8 o'clock in the morning—given everything up 
for lost. Even at 11 he could still have won but his horror on 
hearing that 2 Danish battalions were in position to the rear of his 
left flank (2 squadrons and 4 cannon would have sufficed to 
dispose of them) caused that 'strategic outflanker in maximum 
force' to recall the dictum 'he who outflanks is himself outflanked' 
and he now resolved to use all his forces to extricate  himself.  Our 
theoretician's antagonist was an old man grown grey in command, 
if mostly peace-time command, a mediocre pipe-clay general,3 who 
was answerable not to a petty, philistine, moderate government 
devoid of power, but to a genuine kingb  and ministry and, if only 
for that reason, stood his ground more doggedly. In this way he 
won the battle. The success with which the weak Schleswig-
Holstein detachments fought the Danes, who outnumbered them 
two and three to one (even according to the official Danish 
report),  provides ample proof that the 26,000 Schleswig-
Holsteiners were fully the equal of the 36,000 Danes. The chaps 
fought quite splendidly, despite the numerous raw recruits in their 
ranks,  despite the havoc wrought throughout the entire army by 
Willisen's new regulations introduced only a fortnight before the 
campaign and, above all, despite the shortage of cadres. This army 
would happily have trounced twice their number of Prussians. 
The bombardment of Odessa527 was a must for the allies because 
of the insult to the flag of truce. Not much damage appears to 
have been done and, since they didn't land or occupy the city, it was 
more of a defeat than a victory. Nicest of all is the humbug 
that they 'sailed in the direction of Sevastopol'.0  Incidentally, with 
every Russian action and the RETALIATION, at least apparent or 
attempted, this necessitates, the war is increasingly slipping from 
the grasp of Aberdeen and Palmerston and will gradually assume 
a more warlike course. As it is, Bonaparte must soon acquire gloire 
of a rather more tangible sort, even though his faithful Fridolin, 
Saint-Arnaud, d is just the man to push him further into the soup. 
Had this noble fellow not had a fortune to  refaire, 1" the fortune he 
has already squandered away several times since 1851, he would 
never have gone East. But he and his ilk are just the men to ruin 
the best of troops by fraudulent supply contracts and then,

Dear Engels, 
It was a good thing you didn't come on Saturday.a  My 
trouble—now a fortnight old—had come to a head. I could 
hardly speak and even laughing hurt because of a great festering 
boil between my nose and mouth, which this morning has at least 
dwindled to quite reasonable dimensions. My lips, too, which were 
tremendously swollen, are approximately back to normal again, 
etc., in short, everything indicates that I shall soon be well again. 
It's truly devilish, having such a wretched head for a whole 
fortnight. Beyond a joke. For the past week I've had to give up 
reading and smoking altogether and today am waiting to see if 
Freund will allow me to try a cigar. 
To compound the misery, all three children13 have been down 
with measles since last Friday (Thursday night), which means that 
the house has become a veritable hospital.

Dear Lassalle, 
I have been seriously ill these past 2 or 3 weeks and, on top of 
that, the 3 children" went down with the measles, from which they 
have only just recovered, so that the whole house has been turned 
into a hospital. I did not start going out again until 2 days ago 
and, since my head was the worst affected and all conversation 
exhausted me, I have seen no visitors during this time. The result 
is that I have heard little or nothing of the émigrés' activities and 
intentions. As you will be aware, Mazzini is in Switzerland 
incognito. From letters from Washington I gather that the émigrés 
are, as always, dreaming ambitious dreams. The confidential 
reports sent to America by the gentlemen here percolate back to 
me through a channel in Washington. b 
In my next I may be à même c to send you the detailed 
information you ask for on the doings of the émigrés. 540

Weerth is at present in California. It is rumoured that he is on 
the point of marrying a certain Miss Worbs or Worms, of 
Hamburg, the daughter of one of his former principals. 
Even The Times has been poking some mild fun at the 'Cologne 
TRICKERS' in London who bellow from a hundred throats—bellow at 
the English: 
'Softly sounding through my mind 
Many a delightful chime'3 
or else, 
'Lonely I am not alone'b 
and more in similar vein. 
As regards the 'Palmerston',—he is presently straining every 
nerve to gain complete control of the War Office, though he has a 
rival in the Duke of Newcastle, a Peelite—, only the first few of 
the articles I wrote for the Tribune have been printed here as 
pamphlets.0 I myself prevented further publication, as pamphlets 
by Urquhart were appearing alternately in the same series of 
'Political Fly-Sheets'541 and I do not wish to be numbered among 
the followers of that gentleman with whom I have only one thing 
in common, viz. my views on Palmerston, but to whom in all other 
matters I am diametrically opposed, as became apparent at our 
very first meeting/ He is a romantic reactionary—a Turk, and 
would gladly guide the West back to Turkish standards and 
structures. I have not sent you these few short pamphlets as the 
cost of posting small parcels is disproportionately high. As for the 
substance of the matter, you are perfectly right to abide by your 
opinion until wholly unequivocal facts cause you to change it. 
What has gone to make up my own view is not this or that isolated 
fact—each isolated fact admitting of a variety of interpretations— 
but the concatenation of all the steps taken by this man, the whole 
context of his activities since 1829. In it I have discovered a 
consistent plan that assumes various and often seemingly con­
tradictory forms but is always directed towards the same goal, a 
plan uniformly executed with the same supreme disdain. 
As regards the specific points you raise, my comments are: 
1. Pacifico Expedition.345 In a work by one of Palmerston's 
former secretaries at the embassy in Athens—1836—namely the 
Diplomatic History of Greece by Mr Parish, you will find to begin 
a Heine, 'Neuer Frühling', 6. Gedicht. - b P. A.  Wolff,  Preciosa,  Act II, Scene 2. The 
drama provided the libretto for Weber's opera of the same title. - c K. Marx.

with proof that, from 1830 onwards, Palmerston did all he could 
to turn Greece into a Russian province. In the end the Pacifico 
Expedition dropped her into Russia's lap. At the same time it also 
gained Palmerston popularity in England, thereby enabling him to 
further Russia's interests in the same year by concluding with 
Brunnow a treaty on the Danish succession, a treaty that was not 
made effective until 1852.542  If, having done all the MISCHIEF he 
wanted, Palmerston gave way to France over this affair—the 
Greek one—, his compliance was simply 'diplomacy' vis-à-vis the 
English people. Papers hostile to him were already beginning to 
point out that in 1840 he had turned England into the ally of 
Russia and into the antagonist of France. 
2. Recognition of the coup d'état. 3 Necessary to get Bonaparte 
into his toils. 74 Similarly, in connection with the Spanish troubles, 
he brought the Quadruple Alliance into being earlier in order to 
get Louis Philippe into the mire.543 
3. The instruction of 19 June 1839—wholly justifies my view. 
It was not London but Paris which suggested that in no 
circumstances should Russia be allowed to carry out the Treaty of 
Unkiar-Skelessi510  (which, by the by, was of Mr Palmerston's 
making). The proof—a dispatch from Soult to the Baron de 
Bourqueney, 30 May 1839. Similarly 17 June 1839, etc. Palmer­
ston, who made as if to believe that the Sultan wished to see the 
Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi put into effect and the Russians in 
Constantinople, sent a dispatch to Earl Granville in Paris on 19 
June,  enclosing his  'PROPOSED  INSTRUCTIONS'  of even date  'TO  THE  ADMIRAL, 
SIR ROBERT STOPEORD', in which, among many other ambiguous and 
inane proposals, he also instructed the Admiral if necessary 'TO 
FORCE THE PASSAGE OF DARDANELLES'. Soult, with great bon sens h (see 
dispatch from Earl Granville to Viscount Palmerston, Paris, 28 
June 1839), drew Palmerston's attention to the fact that it was not 
the Sultan but Russia who was their enemy, that this forcing of the 
Dardanelles was inane and that it would suffice if the English and 
French ambassadors in Constantinople were to ask the Sultan  — 
who desired nothing better—to permit the entry of the United Fleets 
into the Dardanelles. To this Palmerston could raise no objection, 
but put forward a proposal even more inane, whereupon Soult 
wrote: 
'The  NOBLE  LORD would seem to resign himself  WITH  GREAT  FACILITY TO 
THE CONTINGENCY OF A RUSSIAN OCCUPATION OF CONSTANTINOPLE'. 
And so it goes on, Palmerston always thwarting French action

Dear Frederic, 
I am back on my feet and the children out of bed again, if not 
yet out of the house, but now my wife has become very unwell, 
probably as a result of the night vigils and nursing, and the worst 
of it is that instead of consulting the doctor which she refuses to 
do, she is dosing herself—on the pretext that two years ago when 
she was similarly indisposed, Freund's medicines only made her 
worse. If matters don't improve I shall finally have to resort to 
force. Thus I shan't be able to do the correspondence on Tuesday, 
for on that day Pieper's lessons prevent him from acting as 
secretary and, with my wife in her present state, I can't bother her 
with any writing. As you can see, I've become a regular Peter 
Schlemihl.a But over the years we have all enjoyed very good 
health on the whole and will, I hope, do so again when this crisis

is past. Au fond, 3 we can be thankful that we've all gone down one 
after the other. 
I wrote an articleb yesterday deriding the plan of campaign 
published in Thursday's Times.0  However, if the French papers 
are to be trusted, it would not appear to be an official one. The 
Moniteur reports that Omer Pasha is hurrying to relieve Silistria. d 
Perhaps this is simply a device to keep the Parisians in good 
humour and to counteract the great Boichot's presence in Paris.e  I 
can make little of the Russian reports or of Napier's in today's 
paper/ Au boufi the English would again appear to have achieved 
nothing. 
Yesterday a great raw-boned chap, a democratic loafer, intro­
duced himself to me as Dr Otto. Danish by birth. Ostensibly now 
expelled from Schleswig-Holstein. Took part in the 1848/49 
Schleswig-Holstein and 'Thuringian' movement. Does Lupus, by 
any chance, possess any particular information about the man? 
Have finished reading the Archivio delle cose dltalia. The man's 
Considerazionih at the back of the book endeavour to demonstrate 
the opposite of what emerges from his collection of documents, 
namely that the Giovane Italia,545 and CONSEQUENTLY Giuseppe 
Mazzini, were the soul of the 1848 movement. What is particularly 
amusing is the final section in which he proves that the 
movements [must] shed their narrow, national character: FRATERNISA­
TION among the various nations that came to grief in 1848/49 as a 
result of their isolation; Russia or the UNITED STATES OF EUROPE. At 
this point comes the following revelation: 
'La servitù d'Italia è patto europeo: l'Italia non puö esser libera che in seno a 
una libera Europa. Allora apparve manifesto doversi sancire, contro l'alleanza dei 
pochi oppressori, l'omnipotente alleanza degli oppressi.'' [Archivio, Vol. I, 560] 
And this  ' I'onnipotente  alleanza degli oppress? was effectuated by 
Mazzini as follows:

Britain.—The War on the Danube.—The Economic Situation'. - c The Times, 
No. 21756, 1 June 1854, leader. - d  [Report from Belgrade of 29 May 1854,] Le

revolutionary activity of the French petty-bourgeois democrats. See this volume, 
pp. 461-62. - f  Reports in Journal de Saint-Pétersbourg of 26 May 1854 and Napier's 
military reports in the section 'The Baltic Fleet' of The Times, No. 21758, 3 June 
1854.  - 8 In the end - h Comments - ' 'Italy's servitude is a European compact: Italy 
can be free only in the bosom of a free Europe. Then it became manifest that an 
omnipotent alliance of the oppressed must be formed to oppose the alliance of the few 
oppressors.'

'Allora Mazzini compié l'ardua sua missione, dettando con Ledru-Rollin e 
Darasz e Rüge, un nuovo patto che stringa Italia, non solo alla Polonia e alla 
Francia, ma alla stessa Germania, serva volente finora, e quasi sacerdotessa della 
servitù. E cosi, dalle opposte parti e dalle più nemiche genti giungono i peregrini al 
santuario commune della libertà.' a [I. 560] 
Have received newspapers from America, but still no letter. 
'Ruge', who has concluded the 'nuovo patto' with Mazzini, declares 
in Dulon's little sheetb  that, as a result of the war against Russia, 
there is now a prospect of 'liberal' development in Germany and 
that, even though no more may be achieved than 'freedom as in 
England', one ought to participate in it. To adopt a pessimistic 
view is 'base, idle and Russian'. As you can see, the prospect of his 
private fortune being exhausted within the year has made the 
noble man ready to attach himself to any form of 'progress' and, 
au cas de  besoin, 12 become 'constitutional'.

writing articles for you precisely on Mondays or Thursdays. On top 
of that, my present lodgings are almost 3U of an hour's walk away 
from the post, so that nothing more can be done late at night for the 
second post. Hence I have to work on Saturdays and on Wednesday 
evenings. Tomorrow I shall send you a comprehensive article on the 
siege of Silistria3 which ought to cause a stir; maybe, too, some notes 
on Napier's absurd naval frolics546 and on the condition of the army 
in Bulgaria. 
I am now swotting the Hungarian campaign in real earnest and 
shall, I think, have worked my way through all the sources by 
October; come what may, I shall write the book this winter} The more 
I go into it, the prettier the thing gets on both sides. At present I 
am comparing Görgey and Windischgrätz, 547 and find that in his 
self-apology the latter is as mendacious as in his bulletins 548 he 
hasn't the courage to disown. Delightful, how each of the two 
adversaries tries to make his own army out to be worse than the 
opposing one. Père Windischgrätz, incidentally, proves himself the 
ass we know him to  be—HE  HAS ACTUALLY  WRITTEN  HIMSELF DOWN AN 
ASS—and  was most ably abetted in his tomfoolery by men even 
more stupid, if such a thing is possible, than  himself,  namely his 
subordinate generals Wrbna, Csorich and, above all, the chivalrous 
Banus Jellacic. Görgey's cynicism enables him to record the facts 
much more frankly and correctly than that mendacious apologist 
Windischgrätz. However, it is a campaign altogether worthy of the 
year '48/49. 
Cold feet on both sides, the old armies and the revolutionary 
forces both discredited. Next week I hope to receive the official 
Austrian bookc  and one of these days I shall go through the 
Brockhaus catalogues to find what sources are still required. 
Another thing I need is Klapka d; then I shall have all the principal 
stuff. 
The thing for The Timese will be written next week; I now have 
all the sources and need only do a little more work on them. 
Could you find out in London what military periodicals are 
published there? Just in case of need. 
Now I must go to the bookseller's if I am not to find it shut; 
let's hear from you soon.

28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
Enclosed letters from Cluss which you needn't return since they 
have already been made known to the competent people and have 
been answered. 
The article on Silistriab is splendid. The request made through 
Austria to Russia549  that she promise to evacuate the Danubian 
principalities (the intention being to conclude an armistice and 
convene a congress in Vienna on the strength of that promise) was 
of purely Russian inspiration. At the same time it was assumed 
that Silistria would quickly fall into Russian hands. The English 
public had been prepared for this event by the entire ministerial 
press.  HENCE  Paskievich's haste. The resistance of the Turks at 
Silistria upset these calculations—just as happened to a similar 
plan that had matured the previous autumn. 
COLONEL Grach is an acquaintance of mine from Trier; not one of 
your Prussian instructors, but a talented ADVENTURER who went to 
Turkey as much as 19 or so years ago to seek his fortune.550 A

Paris,"  had in fact been sent to France as a political emissary by 
Pyat's clique and not, as Pyat declares in execrable English in the 
Advertiser, to pay a visit to his old mother, whom he hadn't seen 
for 5 years. It's really repulsive the way the crapauds continually 
act out of character and remain addicted to these 'melodramatic' 
lies calculated to appeal to the hearts of the petty bourgeois.  C'est 
dégoûtante 
You will shortly have another consignment of Pioniers. Heinzen, 
of course, is ranting and roaring dreadfully about the defunct 
Reform, and has actually managed to trot out a quotation from 
Catullus, no doubt picked up from a school-book complete with 
crib.  Also contains comical diatribes against Dulon. The great 
Ruge writes to them both, friend 'Dulon' and friend 'Heinzen'. He 
informs the latter of his grand design for the foundation of a free 
university in Cincinnati where Ruge intends to drone away 
agreeably the remainder of his days as rector magnifiais in partibus. d 
He can hardly wait to become a professor at last, something which, 
for all his servility, he was unable to 'wrest' from the Saxon 
Minister Lindenau or, before that, from the Prussian Minister 
Altenstein. 'Doctorates' will also be awarded in this glorified 
contrefaçon" of a German university. All that is needed is dollars to 
the tune of  1,000,000  and 6 citizens of Cincinnati to administer 
the finances. In addition, a prospectus covering all disciplines. A 
wild omnium gatherum, mixtum compositum 1 of headings from 
Hegel's Encyclopädie and the table of contents from Ersch and 
Gruber. g E.g. General Linguistics. (Cf. Ersch and Gruber, Pott's 
article on the distribution of languages.) The following are to be 
excluded from professorial chairs: 1. Strauss and Bruno Bauer; 2. 
the 'Sophists' who make stuff and nonsense of philosophy; 3. not 
the doctrine of communism, but the 'vile personages who have 
betrayed the Republic and Liberty'. 551 
In one of his rotten letters Ruge extols 2 anonymous pamphlets 
on Palmerston—never, of course, suspecting that one of them 
originated with me.h 
My wife is now confined to bed. Yesterday I at last managed to 
persuade her to call Dr Freund. As soon as she is at all fit to do 
so, he wants her to take a trip to Germany, which accords with the

myself to telling you that I have not been able to finish by  today,  as 
I had intended, the article on relative strengths and Silistria's

and since anyhow, in view of your wife's illness, your greatest 
difficulty will be to have an article ready for Tuesday's steamer, I

London, 21 June 1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
Your letter arrived early enough, between 2 and 3. But since I 
had only waited until 2, and since I had to go out of town on 
domestic business and my wife saw from the accompanying 
letter552 that the article couldn't be sent off as it stood, it is still 
here.  I shall use it for my Friday's article,553 but would ask you to 
write to me before then—quite briefly if you are short of 
time—about the following points: 
1. Is there anything new in the Turkish bulletins which 
appeared in yesterday's Daily News? Have you any more details 
about the events of 28 [May]-13 [June] (which is as far, I believe, 
as the latest, albeit fragmentary, reports go)? 
2. Is there anything of military significance about the operations 
on the Circassian coast? No doubt the news about Shamyl needs 
further confirmation.554 
3. The entry of the Austrians into Wallachia; what can be said 
about it from the military point de vue? 
From the enclosed letter you will see that I'm over head and 
ears in bad luck. When my wife's illness was at its worst, the good 
Dr Freund kept away and sent me a bill for £26 with the request 
that a 'clear understanding' be reached regarding his 'professional 
relations' to  myself.  Since my wife was in a critical—and is still in a 
serious—condition, I was of course compelled to capitulate to the 
dear 'friend' a and promise him in writing that I would pay £8 
down at the end of this month and the rest by six weekly 
instalments. Had the fellow not attacked me so much à l'imprévu, 
he wouldn't have caught me napping like that. But what was I to 
do? I should have had to pay any other respectable doctor by the 
visit and anyhow, even were this possible, one can't change doctors 
like shirts in the middle of an illness, without first inquiring into 
their competence, etc. 
So I find myself in a  FIX. I know that things are tight with you as 
well. Do you think Dronke might be able to advance me a few

pounds for the instalment due at the end of this month? When he 
was here last, he gave me to understand that he could be 
approached at a time of real crisis. However, I'd like to have your 
opinion first. I must in any case pay the fellow the first instalment 
on the agreed date, and my bill in respect of the past months has 
already been drawn—all of it spent needless to say, since I had 
£12 to pay out for the household, and the total received was 
considerably reduced because of unwritten articles, besides which 
the chemist's bills alone swallowed up a large part of the budget. 
At the end of this week, if my wife feels strong enough, she, the 
children and Lenchen are going to spend a fortnight at Mr Seller's 
villa at Edmonton. She might then be so far restored by the 
country air as to manage the journey to Trier.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 20 July 1854 
Dear Marx, 
To judge by your total silence you must either be hard at work 
or making tremendous EFFORTS to raise money. En attendant* I 
would inform you that, after the brother of Dronke's principalb 
has been to Bradford, Dronke will be in a position to shell out 
some money—just how much, it is impossible to say, but about £3 
or £4. The brother arrives this week, so you should be able to rely 
on it in, say, 3 weeks' time. 
Naut has been in London, here and in Bradford and, until he 
ran into Dronke in the street, had kept out of everyone's way. 
Dronke says he is hellish slack; apparently he—Naut—only saw 
Daniels once or twice in the street and doesn't even know whether 
he's living in Cologne or out in the country. Bürgers and a 
tailor—who, he was unable to say—are in Glatz and said to be 
quite well, and Becker is in Weichselmünde. 556 Otherwise all Naut 
could find to say was that it would be fine if in Prussia they could 
have a constitution like the one in England. 
Dronke, by the way, has got himself into a serious scrape, so 
that the money may not be forthcoming after all. For when he was 
here 4 or 6 weeks ago he got drunk and, at one o'clock in the 
morning or thereabouts, made a grab at a female in the street; 
she, a married, middle-class woman, boxed his ears, whereupon he 
KNOCKED her DOWN. True, Dronke's own version of the story is 
slightly different, but that is what seems to have happened. The 
husband arrived on the scene and went to fetch the police, who 
didn't want to get mixed up in it. The business was protracted by 
Dronke's spurious excuses and now he has finally received an 
ATTORNEY'S letter demanding an APOLOGY AND  COMPENSATION,  failing 
which the FOREIGNER is to be made an example of. Since Buckup's 
brother is just due to come, you can imagine the situation. We 
shall try and reach an accommodation, but it will probably cost 
money. Keep the matter under your hat, by the way, otherwise I'll have 
instant trouble with the little man, since Imandt will promptly

write to him about it; in general, by no means everything I write 
to you is intended for the crew at large. 
In other ways it suits me very well that the swank and swagger 
of the Heise-Dronke-Imandt trio should come to an inglorious 
end, for otherwise one would get no respite from these people 
with their rumbustious drunken contentiousness. Heise, at any 
rate,  has his SETTLER in the shape of a crooked finger which he will 
probably retain for the rest of his days, and Dronke, too, has 
doubtless had enough.

[London,] 22 July 1854 
Dear Engels, 
The alternative reason you suggest for my long silence a is the 
correct one. It would certainly have been preferable had swotting 
been the obstacle. I added another £3 to the 5 so as to pay the 
'friend'b the first instalment and I also needed about £8 for my 
wife's trip, which could no longer be postponed and which called 
for all manner of new equipment, since she could naturally not 
arrive in Trier looking shabby. These extraordinary expenses 
again brought me into conflict with my permanent and 'decent' 
creditors  AND  SO FORTH.  'It's the old, old story.'c 
Not a sign of life from Cluss for four weeks now. 
Que dites-vous de ÏEspagne? d 557 
I must now quite definitely do something further on the military 
situation in Turkey. Firstly: The mess in Asia. Secondly: What I 
have been able to glean from the French Press concerning the 
latest developments on the Danube, though for lack of a map I

have no idea whether or not the names are right: Between the 7th 
and the morning of the 8th there was a battle with the 30,000 
strong Russian corps under Soimonov and Khrulov (or should it 
be e instead of o?). On the evening of the 7th, Khrulov had taken 
up position to the north of Giurgevo. During the night several 
Turkish corps passed above and below the town and advanced on 
the Russians from the rear, with the result that at daybreak 
Khrulov was compelled to break through, incurring severe 
casualties in the process. The Russians withdrew, though not in 
line. One element made for Frateshti, another for Calugemeni (?),a 
another eastwards for the Argish. There they took up positions 
and on the 9th and 10th Selim Pasha and Iskander Bey are said to 
have carried out a successful attack on the Russians in Frateshti. 
On the 9th Gorchakov moved to Dzurdzuma (?) with 20,000 men 
and has been bringing in fresh troops daily. His positions: On the 
left bank of the Argish, the crossings over which have been 
fortified at Fulojci (?),Falastock (?),Korotzani (?) and Prczietsheni (?). 
Positions of the Russian army as a whole: Left wing from 
Kimpolung and Kimpina (?) along the Argish to Braila and Galatz. 
Turks:  From Kalafat through Turna, Giurgevo to Oltenitza and 
(?) Kalarash. From Turna to Islaz. Here Selim Pasha in contact 
with Iskander Bey. Main corps at Giurgevo, corps above Giurgevo 
constitutes an advanced post on the left of the Argish, Oltenitza 
and Silistria. Thirdly: The total strength of the Russian army, from 
an article in The Morning Chronicleh; but contrary to the article I 
estimate a battalion at no more than 550 men. 
Infantry. 
3 divisions of 3rd corps (Osten-Sacken) 
3 " " 4th " (Dannenberg I) 
2 " " 5th " Lüders

128 squadrons each of 120 men, over 15,000 
Artillery. 46 batteries (each of 10 guns = 460) 
([each of] 8 guns = 368) 
Servicing crews and drivers =12,000 (?)

In addition: 10 regiments of Cossack regulars with 40 guns, 3 
battalions of sappers, train with pontoons or reserve parks,  ALL  IN 
ALL: 
128 battalions of infantry = 71,000

Cossacks 8,000 
Wall[achian] militia 6,000 
Total 118,000 
Fourthly: Items which cannot be treated humorously without a 
map:  the hitherto snail-like progress of the French and English, 
who,  it would seem, will not cross the Danube. For what purpose 
has St-Arnaud ordered his troops to march from Adrianople to 
Burgas in the present heat? The noble fellow would seem to be 
perpetually shuttling to and fro between Constantinople and this 
place or that, simply for the sake of the travelling expenses. What 
is the truth realiter" about the English commissariat in Varna, 
Devna, etc.? 
If you no longer have time to write me an article for Tuesday,b 
at least send me a few notes which I can use. 
Apropos. About the poem.c  It probably derives from Gottfried, 
hight Kinkel, or else from a Silesian poet of the school of Opitz, 
or was it composed by Fteise himself? 
I enclose a manuscript snatched from a young writer; show it to 
no one but Lupus. Who is this young writer?

MARX TO ENGELS 84 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 27 July 1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
Je vous attends" for Tuesday. 558 How very boastful Mr Herbert 
was. This same Herbert was Vorontsov's brother-in-law and at the 
same time English  SECRETARY  AT WAR. The way the English brag as 
though Nasmyth and Butler had held Silistria 'single-handed' is 
grotesque. Have you read about Monday evening's session, when 
Disraeli so neatly punctured  LITTLE JOHN'Sb  and the Times' 'Sevas­
topol' BUBBLE with one prick of the needle?559 
I am, hélas, c once again saddled with Pieper who looks like a 
HALF-STARVED  sucking pig seethed in milk, after having lived for a 
fortnight with a whore he describes as un bijou. d He has frittered 
away some £20 in a fortnight and now both his purses are equally 
depleted. In this heat it is a bore to have the fellow hanging 
around one du matin jusqu'au soir et du soir jusqu'au matin" And it 
disrupts one's work. 
On Saturday' I got the following note from Papa Tucker: 
* 'Dear Sir, There is a pretty brisk demand for the "Fly-Sheets" 541 just now. 
Could you send me some articles from the Tribune that could suit the taste of the 
public? The third on Palmerston would move the other two.« Faithfully Yours 
E. Tucker.' * 
Incidentally I have also heard from Freiligrath that that rogue 
Trübner is advertising these 'Fly-Sheets' under his imprint. You 
will note that he asks for 'ARTICLES FROM THE  TRIBUN H:' in order once 
AGAIN  to evade the question of money. Now, 1. So far as he is 
concerned, not one copy of the Tribune is to be had anywhere in 
London, since it is sent only to subscribers and back numbers 
cannot even be ordered from New York; 2. Without substantial 
additions, none of the articles would now suit. Now I must clear 
up the matter with the fellow and this 'easy-going' relationship 
a I expect [something from] you - b Lord John Russell - c alas - d a jewel - e from 
morning to night and night to morning - f  22 July - s A reference to the third, 
fourth and fifth articles from Marx's Lord Palmerston which were published as two 
separate pamphlets.

must end. If he is agreeable, and you for your part approve, I 
would suggest the following: 
1. Of the Tribune articles, I shall give him (for publication) the 
critique of the 'SECRET CORRESPONDENCE'.3 For this Dronke would only 
have to send me the 2nd article on this, which was detained by the 
Post Office here. The latter gratis, 2 and 3 to be paid for in cash 
and on delivery of the MSS, namely. 
2. A GENERAL pamphlet on Palmerston, beginning with my 
introduction in the Tribuneb to which I should, however, add a 
new middle and ending. 
3. A pamphlet that I would have to write in collaboration with 
you, i.e. on England's DIPLOMACY and MILITARY ACTION since war was 
declared. The articles which have appeared in the Tribune will 
provide us with material for both these aspects. If you agree to 3, 
the question arises: 
How much do we ask? 
After all, my articles do seem to sell better than Urquhart's who 
is 'happy' if his stuff in the Advertiser is accepted by Tucker for 
the 'Fly-Sheets'. 
If you agree with all this— (Nos. 2 and 3 would, of course, have 
to be pungent enough TO PRODUCE A REAL SENSATION in London; 
moreover, such is the footing we are on with Tucker that we can 
write anything we choose without worrying about English pre­
judices)—then compose a letter for me putting these proposals to 
Mr Tucker. Not being sufficiently adept in business matters, I 
have deliberately avoided answering him either orally or in 
writing. But no time is to be lost. 
A book that has interested me greatly is Thierry's Histoire de la 
formation et du progrès du Tiers Etat,  1853. 560 It is strange how this 
gendeman, le père c of the 'class struggle' in French historiography, 
inveighs in his Preface against the 'moderns' who, while also 
perceiving the antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, 
purport to discover traces of such opposition as far back as the 
history of the tiers-état d prior to 1789. He is at great pains to show 
that the tiers-état comprises all social ranks and estates save the 
noblesse and clergé and that the bourgeoisie plays the role of 
representative of all these other elements. Quotes, for example, 
from Venetian embassy reports: 
a K. Marx, 'The Documents on the Partition of Turkey' and 'The Secret 
Diplomatic Correspondence'. - b K. Marx, Lord Palmerston, first and second articles 
(entitled 'Palmerston' in the New-York Daily Tribune).- c the father - d Third Estate

'Questi che si chiamano Ii stati del regno sono di tre ordini di persone, cioè del 
clero,  délia nobiltà, e del restante di quelle persone che, per voce commune, si puô 
chiamare popolo' [Thierry, Histoire..., Vol. I, p.  III]. a 
Had Mr Thierry read our  stuff,  he would know that the decisive 
opposition between bourgeoisie and peuple does not, of course, 
crystallise until the former ceases, as tiers-état, to oppose the clergé 
and the noblesse. But as for the 'racines dans l'histoire ... d'un 
antagonisme né d'hier'* his book provides the best proof that the 
origin of the 'racines' coincided with the origin of the tiers-état. By 
the same token, this otherwise intelligent critic wou!d_ have to 
conclude from the 'Senatus populusque Romanus' c that in Rome 
there was never any opposition save that between the senatus and 
the populus. I was interested to discover from the documents he 
quotes that the term 'catalla, capitalia', capital, came into being 
with the rise of the communes. He has, by the by, unwittingly 
demonstrated that the victory of the French bourgeoisie was 
delayed by nothing so much as the fact that it did not decide until 
1789 to make  COMMON  CAUSE  with the peasants. Although he does not 
generalise, he depicts very nicely, 1. how from the beginning, or at 
least since the rise of the towns, the French bourgeoisie has gained 
undue influence by constituting itself a parliament, bureaucracy, 
etc., and not, as in England, by commerce and industrie alone. 
This undoubtedly holds true even of present-day France. 2. From 
his account it may be readily shown how the class rises as the 
various forms in which its centre of gravity has lain at different 
times are ruined and with them the different sections whose 
influence derives from these forms. In my view, this sequence of 
metamorphoses leading up to the domination of the class has 
never before been thus presented—at least so far as the material 
is concerned. In regard to the maîtrises, jurandes, 6 etc., in short, the 
forms,  in which the industrial bourgeoisie develops, he has, alas, 
restricted himself almost wholly to general, and generally known, 
phrases, despite the fact that here too he alone is familiar with the 
material. What he successfully elaborates and underlines is the 
conspiratorial and revolutionary nature of the municipal move­
ment in the twelfth century. The German Emperors, e.g. 
Frederick I and Frederick II, issued edicts against these 'com-
a 'These that call themselves the Estates of the realm are of three orders of 
persons, that of the clergy, of the nobility, and of the rest of those persons who, in 
common parlance, may be called the people.' - b 'roots in history ... of an 
antagonism born yesterday' - c the Senate and Roman people - d guilds, corpora­
tions

muniones', 'conspiratianes' 'conjurationes"1  in very much the same 
spirit as the German Federal Diet. 561 E.g. in 1226 Frederick II 
takes it upon himself to declare null and void all 'consulats'b and 
other free municipal bodies in the towns of Provence: 
'Pervenit nuper ad notitiam nostram quod quarumdam civitatum, villarum et 
aliorum locorum universitates ex c proprio motu constituerunt juridictiones, 
potestates' (Potestad), 'consulatus, regimina et alia quaedam statuta ... et cum jam 
apud quasdam ... in abusum et pravam consuetudinem inoleverunt ... nos ex 
imperiali auctoritate tam juridictiones etc. atque concessiones super his, per comités 
Provinciae et Forcalquerii ab eis obtentas, ex certa scientia revocamus, et inania esse 
censemus' [II, 87]. d 
Further: 
Conventiculas quoque omnes et conjurationes in civitatibus et extra ... inter 
civitatem et civitatem et inter personam et personam seu inter civitatem et 
personam, omnibus modis fieri prohibemus.' (Constitutio pacis Frederici I.) e 
'Quod nulla civitas, nullum oppidum, communiones, constitutiones, col-
ligationes, confederationes vel conjurationes aliquas, quocumque nomine censean-
tur, facere possent; et quod nos, sine domini sui assensu, civitatibus seu oppidis in 
regno nostro constitutis, auctoritatem faciendi communiones, constitutiones ... 
conjurationes aliquas, quaecumque nomina imponantur eisdem, non poteramus nee 
debebamus impertiri.' (Henrici regis sententia contra communiones civitatum.) [II, 
86] f 
Is that not the raide% German professorial style to the life—the 
very same which later graced the fulminations of the 'Central 
Commission of the Confederation'562 ? In Germany, the 'commune 
jurée** penetrated no further than Trier where, in 1161, the 
Emperor Frederick I put a stop to it: 
a communes, secret associations, sworn confederacies - b municipal councils -
c The original has 'in comitatibus ipsis degentes' instead of 'ex'. - d 'It has recently 
been brought to our notice that the guilds of certain cities, market towns and other 
places have, of their own accord, constituted tribunals, authorities (the Podesta), 
consulates, administrations and certain other institutions of this kind ... and 
because, among certain of them ... such things have already developed into abuses 
and malpractices ... we hereby, in virtue of our imperial power, and by our sure 
knowledge, revoke these tribunals, etc., and also the concessions in regard to them 
obtained through the Counts of Provence and Forcalquier and declare them null 
and void.' - e 'We likewise prohibit conventions and sworn confederacies of 
whatever kind within the cities and without ... between city and city or between 
person and person or between city and person.' (Peace Charter of Frede­
rick I.) - f 'That no city and no market town may organise communes, 
constitutions, unions, leagues or sworn confederacies of any kind.by whatever name 
they may be referred to, and that, without the assent of their lord, we neither can 
nor should allow the cities and market towns in our Empire the right to establish 
communes, constitutions ... sworn confederacies of any kind, whatever names may 
be conferred on them.' (Decree of King Henry against city communes.) - 8 stiff -

'Communio quoque civium Trevirensium, quae et conjuratio dicitur, quam nos 
in civitate destruximus ... quae et postea, sicut audivimus, reiterata est, cassetur et 
in irritum revocetur.' [II, 88] a 
The policy pursued by the German emperors was exploited by 
the French roisb  who secretly supported 'conjurationes' and 
'communiones' in Lorraine, Alsace, the Dauphiné, Franche-Comté, 
the Lyonnais, etc., thus alienating them from the German Empire: 
'Sicut ad culminis nostri pervenit notitiam, rex Franciae ... sinceritatem fidei 
vestrae molitur corrumpere.' (Rodolphus I, epistula ad cives de Besançon.) [II, 94] c 
The very same policy was used by the fellows to make Italian 
cities Guelphic.563 
It's funny how the word 'communio' is often reviled in just the 
same way as communism nowadays. Thus, for example, the priest 
Guibert .of Nogent writes: 
'Communio, novum ac pessimum nomen.'ti 
There's often something rather pathetic about the way in which 
the twelfth-century philistines invite the peasants to take refuge in 
the towns, the communio jurata. As, for instance, in the Charter of 
St Quentin: 
'Eux' (the burghers of St Quentin) 'jurèrent ensement chescun quemune ayde à 
son juré et quemun conseil et quemune détenanche et qüemune deffense. 
Ensement nous avons establi que quiconque en notre quemune entrera et ayde du 
sien nous donra, soit pour cause de fuite ou de paour des anemis ou de autre 
forfait ... en le quemune entrer porra, car la porte est ouverte à tous; et se son 
seigneur à tort ses choses aura détenu et ne le voudra détenir à droit, nous en 
exécuterons justice.' [II, 135] 1'

If you can possibly see your way to getting hold of some money 
for me I would urgently request you to do so. The £11 extra

Dear Engels, 
My wife got back on Wednesday,2 quite well. In the Fatherland, 
she tells me, everyone is down in the dumps on account of the 
'uncertain conditions'. 
I cannot imagine what has become of Cluss. The fellow hasn't 
written for months. Perhaps it's too hot over there. 
It is a very good thing that you are rid of Heise. I don't see that 
a 'loafer' of this sort can be of any interest. I have not, of course, 
seen Imandt's correspondence with Dronke and Heise, but I do 
know that, if he takes part in their childish nonsense, he does so at 
most in a 'theoretical' sense. Down here, Imandt lives the life of a 
sober, hard-working citizen. 
I have heard from Lassalle who announces triumphantly that 
the Hatzfeldt woman's 7, or rather 8, years' war is now over. 356 
Enfin! h 'Victory' for the old woman, who would appear to have 
emerged from the campaign with her virtue and, what is more, 
her money bags,  'vierge'."  Lassalle now intends to move his domicile 
to Berlin, but has already heard talk about difficulties with the 
police. 
Meyer writes to tell me that the trial of the Berlin de­
magogues564  (in which Gottfried's Gottfried played a part) has 
been quashed by the court in Berlin (which, he doesn't say), 
'because Hentze, the principal witness for the prosecution, was 
"questionable" '. Qu'en dis-tu? d 
I have also had a letter from Miquel in Paris. He intended to 
come here but first he had cholera and then a haemorrhage, 
whereupon his doctors suggested that he had better drop the idea 
of sea travel and make- for home overland with all dispatch. Bad 
luck. 
Cherval, who under the name of 'Cramer'—this time the real 
name was the pseudonym—had diverse experiences in Switzer­
land, inter alia engraving plates for Mr Vogt, who had taken him 
under his wing, is now living in Paris. I have his address.

whether he'll pull through. 
Reports, particularly  in the  Débats, suggest that there  is a  state 
of splendid anarchy  in Spain.  So far as I can  gather from  the

military events in Asia. I have made a bit of a howler. In one of 
my recent LETTERS I declared the NEWS of the total defeat of the 
Turks at Kars to be a Vienna INVENTION. 565 True, the telegraphic 
dispatch was wrong, but it was nevertheless based on fact." 
My PRINCIPAL  STUDY  is now SPAIN. SO far I have swotted up, mainly 
from Spanish sources, the 1808-14 and the 1820-23 periods. Am 
now coming to the years 1834-43. The thing is not without 
complexity. It is rather more difficult to discover exactly the 
springs behind developments. At any rate I made a timely start 
with Don Quixote.b The whole thing will amount to about 6 articles 
for the Tribune, if much condensed.566 At least it may be counted 
a step forward that AT THIS MOMENT ONE'S STUDIES are paid for. 
Unfortunately the Libraryc is closed from 1-7 September. Apart 
from other advantages, it's the only cool place in London. 
Entre nous,d  Dronke, for want of other 'intellectual' stimulus, is 
busily engaged in investigating 'Steffen' and, in his letters to 
Imandt, tears him to pieces in an attempt to render him politically 
'suspect'. I had no difficulty in convincing Imandt of the total 
absurdity of Dronke's mischievous cavilling.  C'est  absurde.' I 
consider that in Steffen our [party] has made a very good 
acquisition. He has character and education. His views on 
comparative geography, in which he has specialised, are quite 
original. Unfortunately a manuscript in which he elaborated his 
ideas on the subject was left behind in Cologne. 
What is Lupus doing? Miquel didn't come over from Paris as 
intended because, having had 2 attacks of cholera followed by a 
haemorrhage, he was finally ordered by the doctors to make his 
way back to Germany overland with all dispatch.

Dear Engels, 
Once again I must come knocking at your door, much though I 
detest doing so, but compelled by PRESSURE  FROM  WITHOUT. I cannot 
draw my bills for a few weeks yet, since IN CONSEQUENCE OF some 
unpleasantness he has had with Bischoffsheim in this connection, 
Freiligrath is no longer drawing bills of less than £25. On the 
whole, too, this is preferable, for while the constant drawing of' 
small sums may cover the dette flottante, 1 the fixed debt increases. 
On top of that, I shall have to deduct £8 for Freund from the 
next bill since, under the present CIRCUMSTANCES, my wife will need 
rather more care. The EXTRAORDINARY MEANS to which the family is 
wont to resort at times of crisis are AGAIN exhausted and, just as in 
the case of the Spanish Budget everything is in pawn. 
By the by, as regards the 'budget' en general, I have reduced 
total indebtedness to under £50, i.e. about £30 less than it was at 
the beginning of the year. From this you can see that there have 
been some great financial sleights of hand. If a NEGOTIATION I have 
initiated with Lassalle succeeds, and he lends me £30, and you 
lend me the remainder, I would at last be independent again and 
reorganise all my domestic arrangements, whereas at present I 
have to pay out 25 per cent to the pawnshop alone, and in general 
am never able to get things in order because of arrears. As has 
once again been demonstrated in Trier, nothing will be achieved 
with my mater 567 until I can go and importune her in person. 
Dans ce moment^ the total absence of money is the more 
horrible—quite apart from the fact that  FAMILY  WANTS  do not cease 
for an instant—as Soho is a choice district for cholera, the  MOB  is 
croaking right and left (e.g. an average of 3 per house in Broad 
Street),  and 'victuals' 568 are the best defence against the beastly 
thing.

So much for that. I am sending this letter to your private 
address because some strange combination of circumstances could 
cause precisely this by no means edifying epistle to fall into the 
wrong hands at your office. 
As regards the Asiatic business, a considerable stir has been 
made here by the dispatches from that theatre of operations in 
The Morning Chronicle, which have also been reproduced in The 
Observer and other weeklies.3 
I don't know whether the news about the Zouaves' cry 'A bas les 
singes! Il nous faut Lamoricière!' b has penetrated as far as 
Manchester. Espinasse, the first victim of this agitation, has been 
recalled to France. 569 
The party has been having a run of bad luck. Steffen has lost his 
post in Brighton through the bankruptcy of the schoolmaster in 
whose establishment he was employed. It is questionable whether 
he will manage to get the salary already due to him. Pieper has lost 
his post as correspondent to the Union, since Mr Pierce has 
likewise gone bankrupt, and his papers get no more money for 
foreign correspondents. MacGowan, Jones' printer and source of 
credit, has died of cholera. A blow for Jones. Au. THIS IS NOT VERY 
PLEASANT. 
I don't remember muck about Imandt. To inquire into it further 
would only make matters worse. But henceforward I shall break off 
the moment the gentleman makes any 'reference' to Dronke.

How to explain: 1. that the English failed to station a group of 
warships off the Yenikale Straits in sufficient strength to prevent 
the Russians crossing from Anapa, etc.? Was it not perfectly 
possible, indeed imperative under PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, to gain 
control of the SEA OF AZOV with small vessels in order to cut off all 
reinforcements by water? 
2. Should not a diversion in the direction of Bessarabia have 
been made (by Omer Pasha) to prevent the Russians from 
bringing reinforcements into the Crimea from that quarter? Can 
negligence on this score be explained otherwise than by Anglo-
Austrian diplomatic trickery? 
I believe, OF COURSE, that diplomacy on the part of military 
commanders ceases as soon as they find themselves in a mousetrap 
as in the Crimea. But in all that concerns the plan as a whole, I do 
not believe that Palmerston has as yet ceased for one moment to 
evince at least his 'good will'. 
In one of its recent issues, the Tribune is congratulated by my 
rival, A.P.C.,a for its 'SPLENDID CHARACTERISATION' of Espartero.b The 
man, of course, has no idea that he is 'complimenting' me, but at 
the same time a sure instinct has led him to take HOLD of a  VERY  SILLY 
concluding sentence that belongs exclusively to the Tribune.571 
Incidentally, they had deleted every one of my jokes about 
constitutional heroes en general, suspecting that, lurking behind the 
'Monk-Lafayette-Espartero' trio, were certain sarcasms aimed at 
the noble 'Washington'. The paper's uncritical attitude is horrify­
ing. First, they extolled Espartero as the ONLY STATESMAN OF SPAIN. 
Then they took my articles,0 which treat him if anything as a comic 
character, and added: From this one can see that nothing is to be 
expected of Spain. Then, when they got the first article on 
Spain—mere prolegomena leading up to 1808—they believed it 
to constitute the whole and accordingly added on a completely 
heterogeneous but well-meaning conclusion urging the Spaniards 
to show themselves worthy of the Tribune's confidence. 78 How 
they will handle subsequent instalments, I do not know. 
Liebknecht, as you know, has been vacillating most despondently

the German descended on him and he married her,—in a

down-in-the-mouth. His job goes west, since the people are 
moving away. He spent a wretched honeymoon at No. 14 Church 
Street in a house where he got himself heavily in debt. But who 
forced the ass to get married—at this of all times since he was 
perfectly aware of all these circumstances. The woman had in the 
meantime already become engaged to someone else in Germany, 
so at any rate the case was by no means a pressing one. 
If you want to read something really funny you must try and 
get hold of Saturday's Morning Advertiser, in which the LICENSED

was conducted by Mr Foster who once figured as a BARRISTER in 
Baron Nicholson's court.579 All the thanks Urquhart got for having 
extolled the  LICENSED  as England's party above parties were hard 
words and his dismissal. Never, by the way, has the curtain been 
raised quite so much to reveal the innermost squalor of the 
SHOP-KEEPER'S soul.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 17 October 1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
Your enumeration of the Russian armed forces made today is 
FORMIDABLE.3 BUT THERE REMAINS THIS ONE QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED, whether, 
even by exerting themselves to the utmost, they were capable of 
sending more than 200,000 men outside their own country. I am 
aware of no such instance. 
From the standpoint of the old policy,— and what else do 
England and France advocate, even though the English Ministry is 
not in earnest and Napoleon III a caricature—, a distinction must 
be drawn between the interests of England and those of France. 
With the destruction of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and the 
Baltic and the Russians driven out of the Crimea, the Caucasus 
and the provinces they had filched from Persia and Turkey, 
England would have ensured her supremacy at sea and her 
hegemony over the most cultivated part of Asia for another 50 
years.  It would then be just like her old self to let the continentals 
exhaust themselves in a seven years' and other wars—whose main 
theatre would be Germany and, to some extent, Italy—and, at the 
end of the struggle, see neither Russia nor Austria nor France 
supreme on the Continent. For France, on the other hand, the 
real struggle would only begin with the destruction of Russia's 
sea-power and her influence in South Asia. She would be under 
all the greater compulsion to break Russia's power on land in 
order to extend her own power on the Continent, and thus be 
able to cast a corresponding weight onto the scales against 
England, Is there any guarantee that, once England has destroyed 
the Russians in the BALTIC and the BLACK SEA and rendered them 
innocuous to  herself,  revolutions won't break out on the Continent 
and be used by England as a pretext for another official alliance 
with Russia against the Continent? 
However, the real joke is that none of the Englishmen now in 
power—neither Chathams nor Pitts Jun.,  AND  NOT  EVEN  Welling-
a F. Engels, 'The Military Power of Russia'. 

=====第520页=====
488 246. Marx to Engels. 17 October 1854 
tons—seriously pursue even the destruction of Russian sea-power 
and Russian influence in Turkey-Persia-Caucasus. If their  HALF  and 
HALF  MEASURES  compel them to do so, they may consider going  so far; 
but their half-measures and villainy will probably land them in 
trouble, which will provoke MOVEMENTS here at home. 
The following passages, quoted from the Archives des Affaires 
Etrangères in Paris—relating to the Seven Years' War 581—show 
how English Ministers colluded with the enemy actually during the 
campaign and in matters relating to it. On 24 June 1762 the 
French Pompadour marshal Soubise,a  when encamped at 
Wilhelmstal, had allowed himself to be surprised by the English, 
Prussian, Hanoverian, etc., allies and driven back across the Fulda. 
For parliamentary and dynastic reasons, Lord Bute, George Ill's 
Prime Minister, desired peace, but, in view of the nation's bellicose 
mood and its bias in favour of Frederick II, could not propose 
peace so long as the French persisted in letting themselves be 
beaten and in retreating instead of advancing. Choiseul, as you 
know, was then Minister of Foreign Affairs IN FRANCE. In authentic 
publications from the French archives, which I quote verbatim, we 
find: 
Après l'affaire du 24 Juin les ministres anglais écrivirent à M. de Choiseul: Vous 
vous laissez battre et nous ne pouvons plus faire la paix, nous n'oserions pas la  proposer  au 
parlement. M. de Choiseul, désolé de voir rompue la négociation, engage  le roi à écrire 
à M. de Soubise: "Mon cousin, je vous écris la présente, qu'aussitôt que vous l'aurez 
reçue vous passiez la rivière du Fulde et que vous attaquiez les ennemis, sans compter 
sur les dispositions qui vous conviendront et quelque soit le succès, vous n'en serez pas 
responsable. Sur ce je prie Dieu etc." M. de Choiseul écrivit: "La lettre du roi, M. le 
Maréchal, est trop formelle pour que  j'aie  rien à y ajouter. Mais je puis vous dire que 
quand l'armée du roi serait détruite jusqu'au dernier homme et qu'il fût obligé d'enlever une 
nouvelle, Sa Majesté n'en serait  effrayée.'  " b 
a An allusion to Marshal Soubise's liaison with Jeanne Antoinette Pompado­
ur. - b 'After the affair of 24 June, the English Ministers wrote to M. de Choiseul: 
You are permitting  yourselves  to be beaten and we can no longer make peace; we would not 
dare propose it to Parliament. M. de Choiseul, distressed at seeing negotiations broken 
off, urged the King to write to M. de Soubise: "Dear Cousin, I am writing to you so 
that, immediately on receipt of this letter, you should cross the River Fulda and 
attack the enemy without heed for such dispositions as you might think fit and, 
whatever the result, you will not be held responsible. As to which, I pray God, etc." 
M. de Choiseul wrote: "The King's letter, M. le Maréchal, is too explicit for me to 
have to add anything. But I can tell you that, should the King's Army be  destroyed 
down to the last man and His Majesty be obliged to raise a new one, he would not be 
dismayed at it".' 

=====第521页=====
246.  Marx to Engels. 17 October 1854 489 
Here, then, we have the English Ministry demanding outright 
that an allied army, subsidised by them and consisting partly of 
Englishmen, should be buffeted by the French. They had earlier 
meddled in French military operations in the opposite direction 
because George wanted his Hanover to be spared. For in the same 
extraits" we read: 
'En 1762 Mrs. d'Estrées et de Soubise ont commandé l'armée du haut Rhin de 
150 000 hommes, établie en Hesse, à Goettinguen, Mulhouse et Eisenach; Mr. de 
Condé a commandé celle du bas Rhin de 30 00Ö hommes. La cour ne leur demandait 
que de conserver Cassel de Goettinguen jusqu'à la fin du novembre, d'évacuer ces 
deux places à cette époque pour se retirer sur l'Ohm en mettant Ziegenhayn en avant 
de leur première ligne. Ce plan de guerre avec puissance égale, avec 180 000 contre 
80 000 serait extraordinaire, s'il n'avait pas été fondé sur la promesse, que le ministère 
anglais nous faisait de conclure la paix avant le mois de juillet, si nous ne ferions point 
d'incursions dans le Hanovre.' h 
This latter piece of meddling by London might, at most, be 
regarded as normal, had the warring powers been on the point of 
entering into peace negotiations; the first case, on the other hand, 
would have cost Lord Bute his head and George, such was the 
mood at the time (THINK ONLY OF WILKES' AND JUNIUS'' LETTERS582 ), his 
throne but, comme toujours? it was almost A CENTURY before the 
matter came to light. We encounter another such example just 
before the outbreak of the ANTI-JACOBIN WAR 58S when the 'liberal' Fox 
sent a secret emissarye to Catherine II telling her not to be misled 
by Pitt's threats, but to gobble up Poland at her leisure for, should 
Pitt try to go to war against Russia, he would be brought down.584 
True,  Fox was then in the 'opposition' and not the Ministry, and I 
adduce this example simply as evidence that the 'OUTS' are no less 
honourable than the 'INS'. 
Hence I believe that, in assessing the allies' conduct of the 
war—as indeed you infer from time to time in your articles—the 
a extracts - b  In 1762 Messieurs d'Estrées and de Soubise were in command of the 
Army of the Upper Rhine numbering 150,000 men, stationed in Hesse, at 
Göttingen, Mülhau«--n and Eisenach; M. de Condé commanded that of the Lower 
Rhine, numbering 30,000 men. All that the Court asked of them was to hold Cassel 
and Göttingen until the end of November, to evacuate those two places at that time 
and withdraw to the Ohm, having Ziegenhayn before their front line. Even 
assuming equal strengths, let alone 180,000 against 80,000, this plan of campaign 
would have been extraordinary had it not been based on a promise made to us by 
the English Ministry to conclude peace before the month of July, provided that we made no 
incursions into Hanover.' - c Philip Francis - d as always - e Robert Adair

exchanges between Downing Street (especially as long as Palmer-
ston is there) and Petersburg MUST always BE CONSIDERED. I AM SURE 
that, as soon as the armies find themselves in a critical position, 
the generals will sh... on the Cabinet and do their best, since 
Messrs the generals are seldom or never let into secrets and even 
risk their necks—witness the example of Admiral Byng,585 whose 
instructions from the Admiralty of the day were no less deplorable 
than those of e.g. Dundas now. 
I shall try to get hold of Bauer's latest production3 and send it 
to you. 
I don't know whether Napierb and other historians of the 
Franco-Spanish war have presented in its true light a fact for 
which there is ample proof in Spanish works, namely that, right up 
to the end of the war, apart from a brief spell when Napoleon 
himself was in command in Spain,586  a fully organised republican 
conspiracy existed in the French army, aimed at overthrowing 
Napoleon and restoring the republic. Apropos. Authentic sources 
suggest that the great 'Mina y Espoz' c was an egregious rogue, 
inferior to Joh. Becker, NO MILITARY TALENT AT ALL, but cunning, 
worldly-wise and avant tout voleur. 6 A careful study of Spanish 
revolutionary history reveals that it has taken the fellows some 40 
years to subvert the material basis of the priesthood and the 
aristocracy, but that during this time they have also succeeded in 
completely revolutionising the old social order. Incidentally, the 
provisional governments, etc., there show about as much sense as 
in France, etc. Considering the hot-bloodedness of the whole race 
and their indifference to bloodshed, it is typical that, up to the 
time of the civil war of 1834-40, 587 it was precisely the revolution­
ary party which claimed to have a monopoly of philanthropic 
gentleness, and for this it was punished AGAIN and AGAIN. 
Tomorrow Pieper will probably become a  RESIDENT  MASTER  30 miles 
from London. Having lost his post as correspondent to the Union, 
he is forced to accept this appointment. In view of my wife's 
'condition' she will be able to do little as a secretary. 
This is deplorable. 
I have had another dunning letter from the 'friendly' Freund,

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 26 October 1854 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederic, 
While studying the Spanish muck I have got to the bottom of 
the worthy Chateaubriand—a style-specialist who combines in the 
most repellent manner the refined scepticism and Voltairianism of 
the eighteenth century with the refined sentimentalism and 
romanticism of the nineteenth. Stylistically, of course, such a 
combination was bound to be epoch-making in France, though 
even the style has an element of spuriousness which, for all his 
clever tricks, frequently leaps to the eye. As for the political man, 
he has exposed himself utterly in his Congrès de Vérone? 69 and the 
only question is whether he received 'cash' from Alexander 
Pavlovich a or whether he was bought simply by FLATTERY to which 
the conceited fop was more susceptible than anyone else.  AT  ALL 
INSTANCES he received the Order of St Andrew590  from Petersburg. 
Everything about M. le 'Vicomte's' (?) vanitas, notwithstanding his 
now Mephistophelian, now Christian coquetting with vanitatum 
vanitas. h You will remember that, at the time of the Congress, 
Villèle was Louis XVII I's Prime Minister and Chateaubriand 
French envoy in Verona. His Congrès de Vérone, which you may at 
some time have read, contains documents, transactions, etc. Begins 
with a short history of the Span, revolution of 1820-23. As for this 
'history', all I need tell you is that he transfers Madrid to the 
banks of the Tagus (merely so as to quote the Span, saying that 
this river cria oro r) and tells us that Riego led 10,000 men (realiterd 
only 5,000) into the field against the 13,000 under General Freire; 
that Riego, having been beaten, withdrew with 15,000 men. In 
order to compare him with the hero of La Mancha,e  he sends him 
to the Sierra Morena instead of the Sierra de Ronda. This I 
mention en passant as characteristic of his manner. Hardly a date 
that is right. 
The best part of the joke, though, is Mr Chateaubriand's doings

at the Congress of Verona, after the conclusion of which he 
became Foreign Minister and directed the invasion of Spain. 
He says  d'abord*: 
'Je ne me défends point d'être le principal auteur de la guerre d'Espagne'. 
[Chateaubriand. Congrès de Vérone, Vol. I, p. 11], 'Mr. de Villèle ne voulait point les 
hostilités.' 11 [I, 73] 
On the contrary. The text of the instructions sent by Villèle to 
him and Montmorency, who at the outset was also in Verona as 
French Foreign Minister, reads literally: 
'Nous ne nous sommes pas décidés à déclarer la guerre à l'Espagne... [I, 103], 
Les plénipotentiaires de S. M. doivent surtout éviter de se présenter au congrès 
comme rapporteurs des affaires d'Espagne. Les autres puissances peuvent les 
connaître aussi bien que nous... Ce rôle pouvait convenir à l'Autriche au congrès de 
Laybach, 591 parce qu'elle avait la volonté d'envahir Naples.' c [I, 102-03] 
The fellows do precisely the opposite of what was contained in 
their instructions. They 'présentent" 1 themselves as 'rapporteurs des

they presented it from the outset as a specifically French matter. 
Villèle writes: 
'L'opinion de nos plénipotentiaires sur la question de savoir ce qu'il convient au 
congrès de faire relativement à l'Espagne, sera que la France étant la seule 
puissance qui doive agir par ses troupes, elle sera seule juge de cette nécessité.'  8 [I, 
103] 
Whereas they took the line that: 
'C'est sur la forme de ce concours moral' (of the other powers) 'et sur les mesures 
propres à lui assurer le secours matériel qui peut être réclamé par la suite, que la 
France croit, en définitive, nécessaire de fixer Pattentioil de ses augustes alliés.' 11

themselves to the Congress as experts on Spanish affairs. The other powers may

Congress of Laibach because she was willing to invade Naples.' - d present -

co-operation' (of the other powers) 'and to the measures calculated to assure her

From the very beginning, then, Mr Chateaubriand acted directly 
counter to the instructions he received from Paris. Secondly, he 
sought to deceive Villèle about the state of affairs in Verona. Thus, 
for example, he wrote to Villèle: 
'Le vœu très prononcé des puissances est pour la guerre d'Espagne'a  [I, 145]; 
He also seeks to deceive him about the prospects of the war: 
'Les dernières dépèches de M. de Lagarde prouvent combien le succès serait 
facile.'b  [I, 145] 
On the other hand the honest fellow tells us: 
'Non seulement le Congrès n'a pas poussé la France à la guerre, mais la Prusse 
et surtout l'Autriche' [I, 112] (he comments: 'le prince de Metternich, feignant d'être 
russe en détestant la Russie' [I, 116]) 'y étaient très opposées; la Russie  seule  l'approuvait 
et promettait son appui moral et son appui matériel.' [I, 112] 
'Nous disons au président du conseil que le vœu très prononcé des puissances 
est pour la guerre; qu'il ne  s'agit  pas de l'occupation de la Péninsule; qu'il n'est 
question que d'un mouvement rapide; nous montrons un succès facile; et pourtant 
nous savions que le congrès de Vérone ne voulait point la guerre; nous craignions 
que notre mouvement ne se prolongeât bien au delà de l'Ebre; nous pensions qu'il 
nous faudrait occuper longtemps l'Espagne, pour faire une, bonne besogne, mais 
nous ne révélions pas tout, afin d'arriver à notre but, et nous nous disions 
secrètement: "Une fois la Bidassoa592  passée, il faudra bien que le président du 
conseil etc, aille de l'avant".' c [I, 173-74] 
Thus he deceived Villèle in the name of the Congress, as 
previously he had deceived the Congress in the name of Villèle. 
And, not content with that, he proceeded to write to Canning, 
lying in the name of both and against both. 
As a Minister he acted in the same manner. The following letter 
was written by Alexander to Pozzo di Borgo, envoy in Paris, for 
submission to Louis XVIII: 
'L'empereur se flatte encore que la modération prévaudrait dans les conseils du 
gouvernement anglais.' If not etc., 'il regarderait l'attaque dirigée contre la France 
a 'The powers are very strongly in favour of war in Spain.' - b 'The last dispatches 
from M. de Lagarde prove how easy success would be.' - c 'Not only did the 
Congress not urge France to go to war, but Prussia and, above all, Austria' (he 
comments: 'Prince Metternich, pretending to be Russian while detesting Russia') 
'were much opposed to it; Russia alone was in favour and promised her moral 
support and her material support.' 
'We tell the Prime Minister that the powers were strongly in favour of war; that 
it is not a question of occupying the Peninsula; that it is only a question of a 
quick move; we point to an easy success; and yet we knew that the Congress of 
Verona did not want war; we feared that our move would carry us far beyond 
the Ebro; we thought that we should have to occupy Spain for a long time to make a 
good job of it, but in order to achieve our aim, we did not reveal all and secretly told 
each other: "Once the Bidassoa has been crossed, the Prime Minister etc. will be 
forced to go ahead.'"

comme une attaque générale contre tous les alliés et accepterait, sans hésiter, les 
conséquences de ce principe... L'Empereur exhorte le roi à consommer ses propres' 
(!) 'déterminations et à marcher avec confiance contre les hommes des troubles et 
des malheurs. Agissant dans cet esprit l'Empereur rapelle la question agitée au congrès 
relative à la réunion d'une armée russe sur  les frontières  occidentales  de l'Empire comme 
moyen de sûreté européenne.' 2 [I, 477-78] 
(At the Congress, Austria would not hear of it. For which reason 
the matter was temporarily dropped.) 
His purpose, Chateaubriand alleges, was to procure glory (gloire) 
for the Restoration, and thus to pave the way for the violation of 
the Treaties of Vienna. 593 Russia's support was needed against 
England. But how little 1. he expected of Russian help and how 
much 2. he feared the war, is evident from the following utterances: 
'En supposant un revers en Espagne, nous avions une révolution en France, et tous 
les cosaques de la terre ne nous auraient pas sauvés.''b  [I, 113] 
In a letter to La Ferronnays, his envoy in Petersburg, he writes: 
'Nous avons mis la monarchie française sur une carte pour faire la guerre.' c [II, 8] 
(This is dated 21 April 1823.) 
He further admits that they would have fallen flat on their faces 
if Canning had shipped a regiment or two out to Lisbon. To pave 
the way for this result they further saw to it that, following a row 
between War Minister the Duke of Bellune and General Guil-
leminot, the French Army suddenly found itself sin viveres e sin 
medios de transporte* after marching into Spain. Next, the pretty 
piece of humbug that a French victory in the name of the Holy 
Alliance and with its appui moral' would help liberate France from 
the Vienna Treaties. The 'Vicomte' is not 'si bête' 1 as he here makes 
himself out to be. He knows very well what he is about: 'la 
Russie n'a point d'ambassadeur à Constantinople'? At the time there 
a 'The Emperor continues to hope that moderation will prevail in the councils of 
the English government' If not etc., 'he would regard an attack directed against 
France as a general attack upon all the allies and would accept without hesitation 
the consequences of that principle... The Emperor exhorts the King to implement 
his own' (!) 'decisions and to march confidently against the trouble-makers and 
mischief-makers. Acting in this spirit, the Emperor recalls the question raised at the 
Congress relating to the mustering of a Russian army on the western borders of the 
Empire as a means of ensuring the security of Europe. - b Assuming a reverse in 
Spain, we would have had revolution in France, and not all the Cossacks in the world 
would have saved us.' - c 'We have staked the fate of the French monarchy in order to wage 
war. ' - d without victuals and without means of transport - e moral support - f  so 
stupid - s 'Russia has no ambassador in Constantinople'

were underhand dealings with the Greeks;594 and war between 
France and England, not to speak of France's commitments in 
Spain and her defeat there, would have given him a free hand. 
'Nous devions surtout prévoir que l'Angleterre pouvait intervenir et se poser en 
face de nous auprès de l'Espagne.'3  [I, 112] 
To Paris, he writes: 
'Si c'est la guerre, c'est la guerre avec l'Angleterre.' [I, 161] 'Guerre qui pouvait 
devenir européenne, si elle venait à se compliquer d'une guerre en Orient et de 
l'attaque des colonies espagnoles par les Anglais.' b [I, 151] 
Nor is he under any illusions about Alexander's intentions: 
'II est certain que notre triomphe inespéré' (!) 'lui donna quelque jalousie, car il 
s'était secrètement flatté que nous serions force's de recourir à lui.' c [I, 383] 
The 'triumph', then, was not what had been agreed. Besides, 
like the majority of Frenchmen, Chateaubriand believed the 
French Army to be very 'unreliable' so far as the Bourbons were 
concerned. 
Moreover, the 'friendship' between Alexander and Louis XVIII 
was, as Chateaubriand himself relates, all the closer for 
'Louis XVIH' having 'refusé, sous prétexte de religion et par quelque motif 
offensant, le mariage du duc de Berry avec la sœur d'Alexandre' 11 [I, 195] 
and for Louis XVIII's having, for his part, known that at the 
Congress of Vienna (after Bonaparte's return from Elba) Mr 
Alexander had 
'tout à coup demanda aux alliés, s'il ne serait pas bon de donner le duc 
d'Orléans pour roi à la France, quand on aurait une dernière fois vaincu 
Napoléon!' e [I, 196] 
Having a 'grand âme de poète,' 1 the 'Vicomte' makes the following 
admissions: 
'Nous osons dire qu'Alexandre est devenu notre ami.' [I, 223] 
a 'Above all we had to foresee that England might intervene and range herself 
against us and alongside Spain.' - b 'If it is war, it is war with England' 'A war 
which might become a European one if complicated by war in the East and an attack 
upon the Spanish colonies by the English.' - c 'There can be no doubt that our 
unexpected' (!) 'triumph gave him some cause for jealousy, for he had secretly 
flattered himself that we would be compelled to have recourse to him.' - d 'Louis 
XVIII's' having 'refused, on religious grounds and for some offensive reason, 
to sanction the marriage between the Duke of Berry and Alexander's 
sister' - e 'suddenly asked the allies whether it would not be advisable to make the 
Duke of Orleans King of France, once Napoleon had been defeated for the last 
time!'  - f great poetic soul

'Alexandre est le seul prince pour qui nous ayons jamais éprouvé un sincère 
attachement.' [I, 224] 
'Louis XVIII nous détestait.'' [I, 243] 
Withal it is highly entertaining to see how this 'Dieu de St. Louis' 
speechifier, who had to preserve the Spanish throne for a 'petit fils 
de Henri  JV', b595 writes most cavalièrement to General Guilleminot 
telling him not to 'be deterred' from bombarding Cadiz by the fear 
that Ferdinand VII might be struck by shot, etc. 
At all events, it is hence to this ami intimec  of the great Carrel, 
Lamennais, Béranger, etc., that the honour belongs of having, 
over a period of 10 years—in the company of friend Alexander—, 
created the biggest mess Spain has ever known, and this at the 
risk of blowing his Bourbons sky-high. 
Another trait of this pilgrim to the Holy Sepulchre596 : In the 
Congrès de Vérone he himself relates how he forced Louis XVIII 
and Villèle to send Polignac, whom both abhorred, to London as 
envoy. Later, under Charles X, when he himself was envoy in 
Rome, he suddenly and with great brio announced his resignation 
upon the appointment of Polignac as minister because, he alleged, 
'freedom' was doomed. 
If you re-read the book, your contempt for the 'crapauds'd and 
their 'grands hommes" is unlikely to diminish.

No sooner had the false rumours of the fall of Sevastopol 
arrived than His Honour, Public Prosecutor Blind, hit on the plan 
of holding a German meeting—which was also to be made the 
occasion of a declaration of principles—against Russia and the 
German 'prinches' and, more particularly, ad majorem gloriam 3 of 
the Public Prosecutor himself and the German emigration in 
corpore!' It was an occasion on which the 'chiefs' of all factions were 
to foregather PEACEFULLY. I and Freiligrath, of course, beat off this 
attack, so that at first Blind's plan was frustrated. Mais comme les 
grands esprits se  rencontrent, 11 the same thing had occurred to the 
indefatigable Arnold Ruge—who is presendy dumping all manner 
of rubbish in The Morning Advertiser—and, at his written 
invitation, a preparatory meeting took place, COMPOSED OF: Vitting-
hof {chiropodist; 60 years old, a Courlander speaking no known 
tongue; formerly servant to Count Vittinghof of Courland, now 
posing as his own master. This Vittinghof, according to Arnold's 
plan, was to take the chair; a gang of German merchants 
(Gerstenzweig, etc.) were to provide the money and call the 
meeting and, under their auspices, German refugees were to be let 
loose on the platform). Römer (Becker's stepfather and a 
notorious mouchard d). Meyen. Buchheim. Ronge. Ruge, Blind. 
Geck. e—The upshot of the meeting was that Geek and Ronge 
more or less 'called each other out'. Public Prosecutor Blind 
indignantly withdrew from the meeting because Dishcloth Ruge 
refused to include in the programme the phrase 'republic which 
unites us all'. Afterwards Blind called to see me—I was out—and 
complained 'bitterly' to my wife about the 'contempt' in which the 
'German emigration' was held, and about our preventing any 
'concerted' action. As if any of us were preventing the 7 or 8 
jackasses from 'uniting' or 'demonstrating'. (However, if the 
fellows should cause a stir with their meeting and unduly 
compromise 'Germany' by licking English boots, it was our secret 
intention—as yet unknown, by the by, to Staatsrat Blind—to enlist 
the aid of the London Chartists and perhaps hold a rival meeting.)

Dear Engels, 
You forgot to return Dana's letter3—very important in view of 
my relations with the fellows. By some oversight the first two 
pages were omitted from your splendid article of Tuesday's date.b 
However the substance was contained in the 5 following ones, so 
all that suffered was the style. 
I have received from the worthy Dr Freund a third dunning 
letter which I enclose. How do you think I should reply to the 
fellow? It seems to me that ce bon ami c has a mind to take extreme 
measures. With the positive decline in income from the Tribune, as 
a result of which I have sunk below the level of the great Dronke, 
prospects for the noble Freund look gloomier than ever. The 
worst of it is that I shall be needing him again soon. I have been 
invited through Tucker to work on a Retrospective Review which 
is appearing here in London. However have not yet had a detailed 
reply about the punctum puncti, d the fee. 
The day before yesterday I finally received the 2 volumes of 
Ripley's Mexican War, about 1,200 pages, large format. As a

have modelled himself plus ou moins 3 on Napier. The book is 
sensible and, to my mind, not uncritical. Dana has certainly not 
read it. Otherwise he would have seen that their hero, General 
Scott, appears BY NO MEANS in a favourable light, NEITHER as a 
commander-in-chief nor as a GENTLEMAN. The thing is of particular 
interest to me because not long ago I was reading about Fernando 
Cortes' campaign in Antonio de Solis' Conquista de Mexico. Some 
very interesting comparisons might be drawn between the two 
conquistas. By the by, although the two commanders-in-chief— 
Taylor as well as Scott—seem very mediocre to me, the whole war 
was certainly a worthy prelude to the military history of the great 
land of the Yankees. The vast spaces in which the action took 
place and the small number of men with which it was conducted— 
more VOLUNTEERS than REGULAR ARMY at that—impart to it an 
'American' originality. As for Taylor and Scott, their only merit 
seems to have consisted in the conviction that Yankees would 
always be able to extricate themselves, however great the 
predicament they might be landed in. I shall send you the 2 
volumes early next week. Write and tell me—for they are 
bulky—whether by post (I am not clear about the new regulations)

VERY BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY. I have just learnt the details via Cornelius.) 
Taking my cue from your letter, I have written to him601  that: 1. I 
enclose a letter from A. Dana from which he can see how the 
commercial crisis in America has affected me and, through me, 
himself;  2. However, to cover the loss, I have established new 
literary contacts on the strength of which I will undertake in 
writing to pay him £4 on the 10th of every month, starting in 
January 1855. The amount still outstanding is about £17. Should 
Mr Freund not agree to this, then he can prosecute. As he cannot 
fail to realise, Dana's letter would protect me in any COURT. If I 
involve you directly, I shall forfeit 1. my whole position vis-à-vis 
Freund; 2. He will tell (and promptly show my letter to) the 
teacher in his establishment, Mr Gottfried Kinkel, who will pass it 
on to Mr Gerstenberg, who will pass it on to every German Jew 
in the City until it reaches Blanc, which would be BY NO MEANS 
desirable. 
I had asked Lassalle whether he could not obtain some sort of 
literary BUSINESS for me in Germany for I must be serious IN REGARD 
to my decreased income and increased expenditure. Now Lassalle 
puts forward the following proposal, 602 as to which I should like to 
have your well-considered opinion. At the beginning of this month 
his cousin, Dr M. Friedländer will become proprietor of the Neue 
Oder-Zeitung, but—in co. with Stein and Eisner. I am to become 
the paper's London correspondent. 60' Friedländer doesn't think he 
would be able to pay more than 20 talers a month to begin with. 
But Lassalle believes he might be able to push him up to 30. Voilà 
la proposition. 3 It's a miserable pittance. However, too high a value 
should not be set on a litde bit of work for a German 
hole-and-corner rag. Even so, one might pick up £40 or £50. But 
Eisner and Stein—there's the rub! This calls for all the more 
mature consideration as these gentlemen aren't Conservatives but 
actually Liberals, and more directly opposed to us than the Neue 
Preussische Zeitung. THAT IS THE QUESTION. b Think it over carefully. 
I am sending you a copy of The People's Paper so that you can 
read about Jones'  DODGE  C with Barbes (whom, between ourselves, he 
took for Blanqui) and his agitation against Bonaparte for the

Leader" have denounced him for his unpatriotic sentiments. He 
originally had honorary members, amongst whom  myself,  elected 
to his comité for the anti-Bonapartist movement. I chaffed him for 
it, in particular pointing out that if the MOVE was to be effective 
here and on the Continent, it must maintain its purely English 
character. He recognised this, as you will see from his remarks at 
the preliminary meeting with the FRENCH REFUGEES. 605 
On Monday I shall send you the Ripley and Solis' Conquista de 
Mexico by the PARCEL COMP, you mentioned. Return the latter as 
soon as you no longer need it, since it doesn't belong to me. I have 
now read the whole of Ripley (cursorily, of course, this being 
sufficient for my purpose). I am no longer in any doubt—and 
Ripley, in his 'restrained' sarcastic style, often makes it plain—that 
the great Scott is nothing more than a common, petty, untalented, 
carping, envious cur and HUMBUG who, aware that he owed 
everything to the bravery of his soldiers and the  SKILL  of his 
divisional commanders, played dirty tricks in order to reap the 
renown  himself.  He appears to be as great a general as the 
MANY-SIDED Greeley is a great PHILOSOPHER. Throughout the campaign, 
the fellow made a hash of things and played the kind of tricks for 
which any self-respecting court martial would justifiably have had 
him shot. But he is America's foremost (in terms of rank) general. 
Which is doubtless why Dana believes in him. Without question 
Taylor is still worth more than Scott, as the Americ. public seems 
to have sensed when it made the former President of the United 
States and rejected the latter  AGAIN AND AGAIN  despite all his efforts. 
General Worth strikes me as the most significant of them, on 
which point you must let me have your opinion as soon as you have 
read the thing. Also, and more important, on another point. Is it 
not CURIOUS that Scott always remains between 2 and 10 miles from 
the scene of ACTIVE OPERATIONS, that he never appears on the 
battlefield  himself,  but is always simply 'OBSERVING THE PROGRESS OF 
EVENTS' from a safe place in the rear. He himself never appears, as 
Taylor certainly does, when it is necessary in the interests of the 
army's 'morale' for the commander-in-chief to appear. After the 
fierce BATTLE OF Contreras, he and all his STAFF moved up only when 
the whole thing was over. During the fluctuations of the BATTLE OF 
Molino del Rey he passed a message to the 'brave' fellows to the 
effect that they should stand their ground, he himself would 
perhaps appear in person. His 'diplomatic' talents are matched 
only' by his military ones. If he evinces mistrust, it is always of his

more talented divisional commanders, never of Santa Anna who 
leads him by the nose as though he were an aged child. 
It seems to me to be typical of the war that, despite wrong or 
inadequate orders from their CHIEF, every division and every single 
small body of men at all times STUBBORNLY make for their objectives, 
SPONTANEOUSLY exploiting every incident, so that in the end a 
measure of wholeness emerges. A Yankee sense of independence 
and individual proficiency greater, perhaps, than that of the 
Anglo-Saxons. 
The Spanish are already degenerate. But a degenerate Spaniard, 
a Mexican, is an ideal. AH the Spanish vices, braggadocio, swagger 
and Don Quixotry, raised to the third power, but little or nothing 
of the steadiness which the Spaniards possess. The Mexican 
guerrilla war a caricature of the Spanish,606  and even the sauve qui 
peut of the REGULAR ARMIES infinitely surpassed. But then the 
Spaniards have produced no talent comparable to that of Santa 
Anna.

rather CORONERS INQUEST) it was said that important papers, though 
not relating to the assassination, had been found on him.e It would 
be annoying if these included papers from the old days, so that we

I haven't read the Bauer, so bring it with you. 
Next week I start writing for the Neue Oder-Zeitung. 30 talers a 
month for the time being. I suppose, however, that the fellows will 
be satisfied with three articles a week. Not having the money to 
buy books, I cannot possibly bid adieu to my studies at the 
Museum 3 in return for 30 talers a month. Much though I dislike 
the thing, I've accepted it for the sake of my wife's peace of mind. 
Her PROSPECTS,  of course,  are  GLOOMY. 
What I particularly approved of in Ripleyb was his not giving 
way to enthusiastic hyperbole. The strategic mistakes made in the 
Mexican War would seem to be self-explanatory in view of the 
total absence of plan. As for the nicer tactical blunders, I, OF 
COURSE, understand nothing of such matters. I should think that he 
took Napierc for his model, to judge by the way he depicts the 
Mexicans just as Napier does the Spaniards, and in the second 
place strives after FAIRNESS towards the opponents. 
Tomorrow I shall be saddled with Blind and wife. This

I shall begin work as correspondent on Saturday. To start off 
right in the middle of the final part of the 'preliminary' 
parliamentary session WOULD NOT DO. A resume of this short session 
would make a better entrée. For the past two years I have been 
writing—i.e. for publication—only in English. German may give 
me some trouble at the start. 
As you are aware, I edited a Prussian newspaper3  under 
censorship—for a whole year. So I am quite familiar with the 
torments which the Neue Oder-Zeitung may have to endure under 
a new form of censorship, and it is these difficulties, the UNDERHAND 
struggle AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED POWERS which incline me to work in 
the interest of this paper. 
So far as I am aware, and I know pretty well all the important 
reading-rooms in London, the N.O.-Z. is not available in any of 
them. Hence, for the time being, you'll have to send it direct to 
me. I might perhaps be able to introduce it into a reading-room or 
COFFEE-ROOM. 
You would particularly oblige me if, by way of an exception, you 
could send me one issue of the Breslauer Zeitung. Although Edgar 
Bauer comes to see me every week, he has never spoken about his 
articles and I would like to get to know his views from one 
'sample'. 
Since Parliament will be going into recess, and—save for a 
resume of its sessions and PERHAPS of FINANCIAL  MATTERS—there  will be 
little of importance to report, I shall, if these premises hold good, 
write a number of consecutive articles providing a review of the 
conduct of the war in the Crimea so far,612 concerning which I 
have seen nothing sensible, i.e. critical, either here or from 
Germany. Moreover, I suppose that this subject is of the greatest 
general interest and at the same time least liable to lead to a 
conflict with the indirect Royal Prussian Censorship. 
Requesting you to convey my kindest regards to your wife 
whom I have not had the pleasure of meeting. 
Yours

6 and 7  o'clock,  my wife was delivered of a bona fide  TRAVELLER3— 
unfortunately  OF THE. 'SEX'  par excellence.  If it had been a male child, 
well and good. 
Did you know that red  Wolff b is one of the Augsburger's 
London correspondents? I found out by chance, namely by 
reading an article in the said paperc  containing all manner of 
fatuous elucubrations on 'house' and 'home' and 'abroad'—all this 
to throw light on the 'ordure' with which the British troops are 
contending at Balaklava. I saw Freiligrath and told him that in the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung I'd read some nonsense of which 
only Lupus Rufus could be capable. Freiligrath thereupon 
confirmed that Wolff was the 'REAL, IDENTICAL Kobes'. d 
I now have Heine's 3 volumes at home. Amongst other things 
he retails at some length a lie to the effect that I, etc., went to 
console hime after he had been 'attacked' in the Augsburg A.Z. for 
having accepted money from Louis Philippe/ The good Heine 
deliberately forgets that my intervention on his behalf took place 
at the end of 1843 614 and thus could have no connection with FACTS 
which came to light after the February revolution of 1848.615  BUT 
LET IT PASS. Worried by his evil conscience,—the old dog has a 
monstrous memory for such things,—he is trying to ingratiate

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN DÜSSELDORF 
[London,] 23 January 1855 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Lassalle, 
This letter would have been written a week ago had not my wife 
been delivered of a world citizen (female)3 and the consequent 
TROUBLE left me little spare time, as you can readily imagine. 
However, both mother and daughter are doing well. 
It is not very pleasant, mon cher, b to write in such a small [...] au 
fona\ c all one can do is produce miniature dunghills. Mais 
[n'importe]d that the [...] should consider [...] and make no literary 
pretensions, while also hoping that none will be made. 
As regards the various economic questions you put to me,617 so 
far as I know there are as yet no compilations, whether official or 
scientific. Official figures for corn imports are, of course, to be 
found in the BOARD  OF TRADE  TABLES.  But nothing else. Undoubtedly 
there will now be a plethora of works on these matters. A period 
of crisis in England is also one of theoretical research. I shall at 
the earliest opportunity compile something for you from my 
note-books, in which I have collected all sorts of statistical 
information from various sources.618 For the present, merely the 
following, of a quite general nature: 
Imports of Wheat and Flour 
Wheat as wheat Flour 
(quarters) (reduced to quarters) 
1847 2,650,000  1,808,000 
1848  1,865,000  351,000 
1849 4,569,000  1,129,000 
1850 3,778,000  1,102,000 
Thus 8,285,000 [qrs] of wheat imported during the first 2 years 
of FREE  TRADE,  and 2,226,000 in the form of flour, in all 10,511,000, 
or an average of more than 5 million quarters over the 2 years. 
This amounts to far more than 1/6 of total consumption, reckoned 
at 1 quarter per person per year. 
Eleanor - b my dear fellow - c at bottom - d But no matter 

=====第544页=====
512 259. Marx to  Lassalle.  23 January 1855 
Now, can it be said that annual consumption increased to that 
extent? This clearly depends on the answer to another question: 
whether the same amount of wheat was produced in England as 
heretofore? This again can only be answered when we are in 
possession of the agricultural statistics, upon which work has only 
just begun. As regards Ireland and Scotland, we know that 
considerable amounts [of the la]nd have been turned over to 
pasture, etc., since the abolition of the corn tariffs. 72 [As regards 
Englanjd, no conclusion can be reached at present save by 
induction. If in England, a considerable area of land had not been 
withdrawn from cultivation, how came it that e.g. this year, despite 
a very good harvest, corn prices are higher than in the 
protectionist year, 1839, for instance, although the loss of imports 
from abroad in no way compensates for the difference between a 
good and a bad harvest, between, say, that of 1854 and that of 
1853? How the tendency to withdraw land from cultivation has 
spread under  FREE  TRADE—mainly,  no doubt, by turning it over to 
pasture—is evident from the following table, an official one (for 
Ireland): 
1854 (up till November) 
Acres 
[Decrease  in Ce]reals 91,233 
[Green  Crops]  ([Potatoes,  roots etc.) 710 
Flax 23,607 
Clover  13,025 
Total  decrease in cultivated land 128,575 
Last year (1853), on the other hand, the total decrease was only 
43,867 acres. Making, for both years taken together, 172,442. This 
is all the more striking as the demand for all agricultural produce 
has risen in the past 2 years. 
Now as regards the  'HANDS'  employed in agriculture, we know 
that, of the 300,000 people who have emigrated every year from 
Great Britain since 1852, the great majority consisted of agricul­
tural workers. We know that in 1853 the population decreased for 
the first time instead of increasing. Finally, the best proof that the 
number of agricultural  HANDS  has greatly decreased is that in 1853 
wages in rural areas rose for the first time since 1815 and that 
mechanical reapers were more or less generally introduced in 
order to depress them again. 

=====第545页=====
259. Marx to Lassalle. 23 January 1855 513 
(Incidentally, I would point out that the free import of foreign 
corn has given England's agronomy a tre[men]dous impetus.) 
What [influence] FREE TRADE has had on the price of industrial 
[products] is absolutely impossible to assess from the material so 
far available. In the woollen and linen industry, for example, the 
fluctuations dependent on raw material can hardly have been 
affected in any way by the REPEAL of the CORN-LAWS. On the whole I 
believe that the history of prices from 1849 to 1854 will show that 
the price-relations between all manufactured products and grain, 
as well as between individual branches of industry and the 
corresponding raw materials remained the same before and after 
the repeal of the Corn Laws (likewise the variations within each 
group). 
As for wages in the factories (figures another time), it can be 
proved beyond doubt that the repeal of the Corn Laws, 1. has had 
no influence whatever on absolute wages, 2. has contributed to 
depress relative] wages. In the year of crisis3 wages [had] been 
depressed. They were not raised in the relatively good years 
1849-52 (the latter included, at least up to the last 1/3 of the year). 
Why weren't they raised? Because the price of foodstuffs had 
fallen. In the course of 1852 the great emigration began, while on 
the other hand demand rose appreciably in the United States, 
Australia, India, etc. The workers then demanded a 10 per cent 
rise in wages and for a short time, while prosperity was at its 
height (until about August 1853), were able to achieve it in almost the 
majority of branches of industry. However, as you know, they were 
soon deprived of this 10 per cent rise—remember, e.g., the Preston 
STRIKE 431—although  corn prices were on average higher in 1853 and 
1854 than in the protectionist years 1843-45 and 1830-37. Hence the 
rise in wages—a very temporary rise, for already short time is being 
worked again and, generally speaking, the crisis has begun—is in no 
way attributable to FREE TRADE, but corresponds wholly to the rise that 
takes place in all years of prosperity. In fact  FREE  TRADE  simply meant 
that from 1849 to 1852 wages did not rise. Since it was possible to buy 
more food with the same wages, these were not increased. What did 
show a relative increase, therefore, was profits. Hence relative wages, 
i.e. wages in relation to profits, have in fact fallen—a result which 
I showed to be inevitable in a pamphletb (FRENCH) written as long 
ago as 1847. 
Of course, one cannot deny that the repeal of the Corn Laws 
may have in some degree contributed (together with the adjust-
a 1847 - b K. Marx, 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade'.

ment of the sugar tax, the raising of restrictions on shipping and 
the repeal of the protective tariffs on British North American 
timber) to creating new, or enlarging existing, markets for British 
manufactures abroad. For instance, in the United States the 
tendency to legislate in favour of free trade was certainly due 
partly to the REPEAL in England. However, too much importance 
should not be attached to this, since there was a decrease in 
English exports e.g. to Russia, whose exports to England increased 
enormously as a result of the REPEAL. In general, it would appear 
that, relatively speaking, Europe's importance as a market for 
English goods is steadily diminishing; since in 1854, 60 per cent of 
total exports (I mean total exports of British products, disregarding 
re-exports) were absorbed by the United States, Australia and 
India alone, a figure which does not include Britain's colonies 
outside Europe (excepting India). 
I have jotted down the above information to provide a very 
general answer to your questions. I shall see what I can find in the 
way of definite statistical material in my note-books. As already 
mentioned, books will no doubt only begin coming out now..."

of all  being nominated  by the  COURT OF PROPRIETORS,  now 12 to be 
nominated  by the  latter  and 6 by the  Ministry. Salary  of DIRECTORS 
to be  once more increased from £300  to  £500, those  of the 
CHAIRMAN  and  DEPUTY  CHAIRMAN  to £1,000.  GOVERNOR-GENERALSHIP  of 
India  to be  separated from  the  GOVERNORSHIP  of Bengal.  New 
PRESIDENCY  ON THE  INDUS.  Thus, instead  of the  inexpensive  and, as 
practice  has  shown, efficient  SIMPLE COMMISSIONERS,  new  GOVERNORS  and 
PRESIDENTS  with  LUXURIOUS COUNCILS. NEW SINECURES.  A few  quite insignifi­
cant little reforms  in the  Indian judiciary. 
2. Budget. Many  of its  FEATURES  lifted from Disraeli,  but  whereas  it 
removes  EXCISE DUTIES  for the  benefit  of the  town, Disraeli  did so 
ostensibly  for the  benefit  of the  FARMERS;  thus  the tea  DUTY  business, 
extension  of direct taxation,  etc., of  Jewish" origin. Some  of the 
most important decisions forced upon Gladstone after  he and his 
opposition  to them  had  been repeatedly voted down  in Parliament. 
For instance, the abolition of the  ADVERTISEMENT  DUTY;  the  SUCCESSION 
DUTY. LICENSING SYSTEM, NEW REGULATION  dropped after undergoing sever­
al transformations  in the  course  of the  session.  Of the  budget, 
which made  its  début with  all the  pretensions  of a  systematic 
encyclopaedia, nothing remains save  a mixtum compositum 1' of LITTLE 
ITEMS.  Typical feature:  the  noble Gladstone includes  in his  BUDGET  a 
special  BILL—abolition  of  STAMPS ON NEWSPAPER  SUPPLEMENTS—intended  to 
buy The  Times,  in  effect making  it a  present  of £30-40,000  a year. 
Since  it alone issues  SUPPLEMENTS,  consolidates  its  monopoly. c The 
Times gratefully abandons  its  campaign against  his  INCOME TAX  and 
today  is again demanding  his  inclusion  in the new  Cabinet.

deliberate lies  all the  statements made  by the  chaps during  1853. 
7 April. Lord Grey (even then minded  to become  War  Minister; 
notorious  for  having,  as Colonial Minister, brought every English 
colony  to the  verge  of rebellion) makes  his  speech  in the  LORDS' 
complaining about England's lack  of  military organisation. This 
merely provides  the  Ministers with  an  opportunity—8 June—of 
creating  one  more post  and one  more salary  by  separating  the 
MINISTRY FOR WAR  g from the  COLONIAL MINISTRY  without concentration 
of DEPARTMENTS.  Cholera  is likewise used  as a  pretext  to create  an 
INDEPENDENT  President  of the  'Board  of  Health'  and  thus  a new 
ministerial post  and  salary.

My wife is getting on satisfactorily. But all is by no means well 
with the child,3 I fear. 
Enclosed 1. Letter from Lassalle; 2. from Daniels; 3. the cuttings 
to which Lassalle refers 635; Goldheim has been prowling about 
among the workers in Solingen etc. under the name of 'Lassalle'. 
4. Letter from Steffen who, however, has omitted to give his 
Brighton address and will begin to grumble again if, in the 
circumstances, I don't reply. 
As a result of the Barbes business Jones, of course, got mixed up 
with the crapauds, h and with the crapule 0 among them at that. So 
another big banquet of all nations was arranged for the February 
celebrations. 636 He came to see me, too, and I laughed in his face. 
Meanwhile his Frenchmen (a quite unknown  MOB)  had dug up the 
ex-Schapper Association637  which did not, OF COURSE, reject such 
good graces. Moreover the malcontents among the Polish and 
Italian émigrés —who are not accounted 'superior refugees'—are 
said to have organised themselves for the purpose of sending 
delegates to the Committee. 638 For the fun of it, Götz and I let 
Jones take us to their meeting yesterday, we being designated 
'observers'. He introduced us as 'OLD FRIENDS OF THE CHARTIST PARTY' 
who,  doubtless, were entitled to satisfy their curiosity. Who was 
there? Various crapauds of the basest sort. A Spanish tailor or 
tobacco manufacturer who had 'convened  himself.  Stechan (half 
crazed) and behind him three notorious German louts. Schapper 
himself being no longer available, Stechan, tried to ape the 
former's physiognomy, his morose gravity, his gesticulations, as 
once the butcher Legendre those of Danton. But that was not all. 
Herzen the Russian went uninvited to the previous meeting, and 
(himself) moved that he be nominated a member of the 
Committee. 639 At the meeting we attended, an obsequious letter 
from him was read out and, because the politically wise 
Frenchmen thought him 'un garçon charmant', 6 he was admitted 
without further ado. The meeting, the chattering of the 
Frenchmen, the glazed expressions of the Germans, the gesticula­
tions of the Spanish tailor were so awful that Jones (CHAIRMAN) 1. 
proposed that everyone should speak only once and for not more 
than ten minutes; 2. upon its being remarked that the Spaniard 
was not an émigré because democracy had triumphed there, he 
came out with an ambiguous compliment that 'he wished every 
émigré community in London a similar lot* so that thus 'no 
international committees need be maintained' here.

Dear Engels, 
Firstly an acknowledgement of receipt of the  'BULLION',  and 
secondly of today's splendid article. b For the past 4-5 days I have 
been prevented from writing, hence also to you, by a severe 
inflammation of the eyes which is not yet fully cleared up: also, as 
a result of the cold weather my  USUAL  SECRETARY C has not risen from 
her bed again as quickly as is her wont. However I think that she 
will shortly be able to return to her post. My eye trouble was 
brought on by reading through my own note-books on 
economics,618 the intention being, not so much to elaborate the 
thing, as at any rate to master the material and get it READY to work 
on. 
I have told you how Herzen elbowed his way on to the 
'International Committee'.* 1 Enclosed is a letter from him in which 
he proffers thanks for the 'invitation' which 'was never made'. The 
letter was intended for publication in The  People's  Paper in order to 
assert his importance coram publico? This miscarried, for I 
immediately wheedled the scrawl out of Jones. However Herzen 
has had himself nominated a steward.

Also enclosed  a 2nd  letter,  in which this committee invites  me to 
the banquet  and 'to  take part  in the  MEETING'.  I do not  want  to 
offend  the  crapauds," still less  the  Chartists.  So the  question  is: in 
what form  I should couch  my  refusal. Tell  me  your view by return. 
The thing must  be declined,  1. because such MEETINGS  are, on the 
whole, HUMBUG;  2. because  at this moment  it would  be to  expose 
oneself uselessly  to GOVERNMENTAL  PERSECUTION,  and  Palmerston has  his 
eye on me; 3.  because  at no  time  and in no  place  do I  wish  to 
appear alongside Herzen,  not being  of the  view that OLD EUROPE 
should  be rejuvenated with Russian blood. 640 Should one's reply, 
perhaps, include some reference  to Herzen's presence? 
Jones  has  done something infinitely 'stupid', indeed gone 
completely  off the  rails,  in leaving  the  management  of the  affair  to 
the crapauds  and the  German louts.  He sacrificed everything  to the 
desire  to show,  at a big  PUBLIC MEETING, that  the  FOREIGN EMIGRATIONS 
were  in the tow of the  Chartists.  The  MEETING will  be a  large  one 
and create  an  uproar,  but as a  result:  1. Urquhart  and Co. 
(likewise  The  Times  if the  thing creates  a sensation) will denounce 
the Chartists  as being  led by  Russian agents. This  is unavoidable. 
2. It will provide  the  Ministry with  a pretext  for  reviving  the 
Aliens Bill. 75 3. Discord within  the  Chartist Party.  Has  already 
broken  out. A  section  of the  London Chartists maintains that 
Jones  has  ARBITRARILY departed from  the  Charter  and  compromised 
their whole cause  by  adopting  the  slogan 'SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC' when forming  the  branch committee which  is to be the 
CONNECTING LINK  between the Chartists and the  FOREIGN EMIGRATION. 1" 
There  is no  denying  the  extent  of Jones' energy, persistence  and 
activity,  yet he  goes  and  spoils everything  by the way he  cries  his 
wares,  by his  tactless striving after pretexts  for  agitation  and his 
anxiety  to be  ahead  of the  time.  If he  can't agitate  in reality,  he 
seeks  an  appearance  of  agitation, improvises MOVEMENTS after 
MOVEMENTS  (SO  that,  of course, everything remains  at a  standstill) 
and periodically works himself  up  into  a state  of fictitious 
exaltation.  I have warned  him, but in  vain. 
Mr Golovin—Herzen's fidus Achates0—has inserted  in today's 
Morning Advertiser, under  the  heading 'February Revolution',  a 
small notice  to the  effect that 
'he has  heard that Herzen  is to  represent Russia,  OR  RATHER LIBERAL RUSSIA,  at 
the banquet.  His  name alone betrays that  he is a  German,  or rather  a German Jew.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 8 March 1855 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
Received the £5. 
I cannot get away until COLONEL Musch is visibly recovered. 
However, this week he has made rapid strides towards convales­
cence, today the doctor was EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED, and next week 
everything may be ALL RIGHT. As soon as I can depart with a good 
conscience, I shall write to you. Next week, I imagine. 
Yesterday we were informed of A VERY HAPPY EVENT, the death of 
my wife's uncle, aged 90.a As a result, my mother-in-lawb  will save 
an annual impost of 200 talers and my wife will get almost £100; 
more if the old dog hasn't made over to his housekeeper such of 
his money as is not entailed. Another question which will be 
settled is that of the Duke of Brunswick's manuscript on the Seven 
Years'  War, for which old Scharnhorst has already offered large 
sums.  My wife immediately registered a protest against any 
attempts by her brother' to make a present of it to 'His Most 
Gracious Highness'. d Let the Prussian state acquire it for cash  BUT 
NOT OTHERWISE. 
There is a prospect of another possible source of money. My 
wife had deposited 1,300 talers with one Grach, a banker in Trier. 
The fellow went bankrupt and, in her case, had acted fraudulently, 
since he was already insolvent (although unbeknown to the public) 
when he accepted her deposit. On the urgent plea of the wife of 
this Grach, my wife 'relented' and refrained from pursuing the 
matter in the courts. The Chief Public Prosecutor had stated that 
Grach would otherwise be brought before the Assizes. This 
Grach's wife has now inherited a large fortune and, if she keeps 
her promise, we can count on the recovery of at least part of the 
loss. In any case this will mean that the 'past' has been discharged 
once and for all and a weight lifted from our shoulders. 
Napoleon Bonaparte'se  pamphlet—(Girardin denies in La Presse 
that he is the faiseur 1)—amused me very much. 642 Despite the

attempt  to present  'le prince'  in an  imposing attitude, despite  the 
French braggadocio, superficiality,  and  BLUNDERS  in things military, 
the pamphlet  is worth  its  weight  in gold  as a  memorial  to our 
Leroy, alias St-Arnaud,  and  generally  as  typical  of the  'IMPERIAL 
BARNUM' 11 and his round table. 
There  is one  point  you  might clear  up for me  about  the 
Crimean business, namely: General Evans declared before  the 
committee b that  the  main reason  for the  MELTING OF THE ARMY  before 
Sevastopol  was the  absence  of a  road from  the  harbour  of 
Balaklava;  1,000 men  would have sufficed  to build  one in 10  days, 
but— et c'est la  question^—ALL  MEN WHO  COULD HAVE BEEN SPARED WERE 
EMPLOYED  IN THE  TRENCHES,  and from the start the extent of the lines to 
be captured  by the  English  was  grossly disproportionate  TO  THEIR 
NUMERICAL STRENGTH.  The question is: Could the French be regarded 
as the  CONTRIVERS  of this  MISCHIEF? 
A short while  ago I  took another look  at  Roman history 
(ancient)  up to the  time  of Augustus.643  Internal history resolves 
itself  PLAINLY  into  the  struggle between small  and  large landed 
property, specifically modified,  of  course,  by  slavery relations. 
Debtor-creditor relations, which play  so  large  a part from  the 
origines  of Roman history, figure merely  as an  inherent conse­
quence  of small landed property. 
Today  1 saw an  advertisement  for 3  works  by Forster,  a parson, 
all having  in common  the  title Original Language.

Dear Engels, 
Musch has been improving visibly for the past few days and the 
doctor sees every reason for hope. If all goes well, Musch must go 
into the country straight away. He is, of course, terribly weak and 
wasted. The fever is  GOT  RID OF and the constipation considerably 
abated. The real question now is whether his constitution is strong 
enough to undergo the whole treatment. However, I think it is. As 
soon as the doctor says he is out of danger, I shall come and visit 
you.

Dear Engels, 
From day to day I have put off sending you a bulletin0  because 
the ups and downs of the illness were such that I changed my 
opinion almost hourly. Latterly, however, the illness has assumed 
the character, hereditary in my family, of an abdominal consump­
tion, and even the doctor seems to have given up hope. For the 
past week emotional stress has made my wife iller than ever 
before. As for  myself,  though my heart is bleeding and my head 
afire,  I must, of course, maintain my composure. Never for one 
moment throughout his illness has the child been untrue to his 
own good-natured, and at the same time independent,  self.

Dear Engels, 
I am thinking of coming up to Manchester with my wife on 
Wednesday3; she must have a change of scene for a few days. 
Unless I let you know to the contrary, Wednesday will be the day. 
I shall at any rate be writing again on Monday. 
Needless to say, the house has been very desolate and bereft 
since the death of the dear childb who was its life and soul. I 
cannot tell you how we miss the child at every turn. I've already 
had my share of bad luck but only now do I know what real 
unhappiness is. I feel BROKEN DOWN. Since the funeral I have been 
fortunate enough to have such splitting headaches that I can 
neither think nor hear nor see. 
Amid all the fearful torments I have recently had to endure, the 
thought of you and your friendship has always sustained me, as 
has the hope that there is still something sensible for us to do

inebriated postman had already passed the door when Lenchen 
grabbed him and took away the letter. From Dana's letter,650 
enclosed herewith, you will see that he is asking for 1. a column

the latter, you must send me the material and I shall have to do 
it.651 It is true that, in the latter case, my unfamiliarity with the 
subject would make for a sorry result, but I cannot let slip the £10 
to be earned in this way, for, on the one hand, no money is yet 
coming in from the legacy and, on the other, expenses have been 
very heavy; added to which there has been a loss of earnings, since 
the worthy Dronke did not keep the Neue Oder-Zeitung supplied 
during my absence (despite his promise) and, as to the Tribune 
itself,  there was still an overdraft outstanding (only cleared off by 
today's post e).

refused, no doubt because they are afraid of acquiring the reputation of being

Dear Frederic, 
The £5 received on Monday. 
For 3 days I have been rummaging through a mass of stuff at 
the Museum651 without finding anything about the Neapolitan 
army save for the following, which may also be found in 
MacCulloch's Dictionary Geographical, Statistical etc. 
In 1848 the army  NEARLY  49,000 strong (this seems to be its war 
footing, as I find it given {in a Dizionario Politico, Turin} as 
26-27,000 strong in 1840). Of these, 32,000 INFANTRY OF THE LINE, 
5,000  CAVALRY, 4,000 ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS, and  8,000  gendarmes. 
They claim to be able to increase their army to 64,237 and this is 
given as the official war footing. 

=====第573页=====

I discovered from Ricciardi that the son of Ferdinand Ia and 
father of King Bombab first engaged the Swiss—in 1824 or 
1825—for 30 years (the Neapolitan army having aped the Spanish 
and mutinied) at 3 times the pay of the NATIVE ARMY. Since the 
government of the Two Sicilies relies on Swiss and lazzaroni at 
home and on the Austrian army abroad, and itself estimates at 
zero its badly paid, undisciplined, demoralised, cowardly army, I 
believe that in any survey of the European armies, this estimate 
made by its own government could be accepted, the army put at 
zero,  and its strength mentioned only en passant. 
There might be something more detailed in Mariotti. But I 
couldn't get hold of it as it was always 'IN HAND' whenever I asked 
for it. 
Our tamily life here is still melancholy. My wife still very unwell. 
The memory of our poor, dear childc torments us, and even 
interposes itself in his sisters"1 play. Such blows can only be 
mitigated slowly, with the passage of time. To me the loss is as 
poignant as on the first day and hence I can tell how much my 
wife is suffering. Should the Scotch money6 arrive in time I shall 
spend a few weeks in Kent, where plenty of cheap and pleasantly 
situated places are said to be available. 
The scenes in Hyde Park last Sunday were DISGUSTING, firstly 
because of the CONSTABLES' brutality, and secondly because of the 
purely passive resistance put up by the huge crowds.655 However, 
things are clearly seething and fermenting and we can only hope 
that great disasters in the Crimea will bring them to a head.

Dear Engels, 
Strohn is here and, unfortunately, prevents me from sending an 
ARTICLE to the Tribune today. I therefore intend to send off on 
Friday, 3 under Tuesday's date, an article on the latest ministerial 
crisis,  and I should be very grateful if, at the same time, you would 
send me one on, say, the Prussian army (assuming that nothing 
occurs in the theatre of war),b so that 2 articles go off at  once.  For I 
shall be compelled to draw a bill on the Tribune next week, or 
rather overdraw and appreciably so at that, as I had already 
overdrawn last time, and this time several days have been missed. 
A German returning from Yankeeland, Gustav Pöckel, brought 
me a line or two from Edgar c and more detailed news about him 
and other acquaintances. Of late, Edgar had been working as a 
farm labourer near New York and intended to sell his farm in 
Texas. Schramm d  is said to be dying of consumption and is also in 
New York State. Ewerbeck passed through about eighteen months 
ago on his way to visit Cabet in Nauvoo. Fickler took over the 
Shakespeare Hotel after Lièvre went bankrupt, making the most 
of the occasion to do the dirty on him. JacobiV affairs are 
prospering; the Yankees like his 'serious' and 'reserved' manner. 
Field Marshal Blenker and a few other notorious swindlers from 
the days of the revolution comedy have bought up real estate with 
the stolen funds and, as regards swagger and brutality towards 
their workpeople, are said to put the Yankees completely in the 
shade. Heinzen has re-established himself in New York with his 
Pionier. All in all, things are going very badly for the Germans over 
there, at one and the same time harassed by the Maine Law, 
KNOW-NOTHINGS 656 and the crisis in agriculture and industry. Hence 
a substantial re-emigration to Germany, Canada and South 
America.

feel the loss as keenly as on the first day. My poor wife is also 
completely BROKEN DOWN.

thus prevented from writing, save for the necessary pieces for 
New York AND GERMANY. The article on the 'ARMIES' is splendid. 0

In the past weeks I have sent the Tribune a series of 
articles—i.e. 3—about Lord John Russell in which the little man is 
passed in review from the very beginning.659 However, it will soon 
be necessary to say  SOME WORDS  about the war and also, perhaps, 
about how the affaire is going in Asia. 
Dronke has suffered a bitter disappointment. For it eventually 
transpired that the issue of a passport to Paris had been due to a 
misunderstanding on the part of the French Embassy; rather, 
express instructions had been given that he was not to be admitted 
into France. In a few days it will be decided whether or not he has 
obtained a post in Jersey. 
Bonaparte has, within the bounds of pure reason, solved the 
problem I set him, namely 'to steal the whole of France in order to 
make a present of it to France again'.b His manoeuvrings over the 
loan are significant experiments in that direction.

As regards Putnam's, we must now get a move on. In a letter I 
got from Dana he already evinced anxiety lest No. 2C should 
arrive too late. But it was there on time, as I see from a 
subsequent letter.d  Putnam has asked for another article on  'THE 
IMPROVEMENTS IN MODERN WARFARE'. The New-York Times contains criti­
cism which is generally favourable, but clearly grudging: off duty, 
Englishmen don't wear 'narrow trousers', their squadrons number 
more than 400 SABRES, and a ? after 'SABRES' too, and, lastly, the 
writer seems to be unaware that in England flogging is now 
restricted to 50 strokes and is inflicted only in exceptional cases. 
The business at Aldershot where, ABOUT H DAYS ago, a SOLDIER died 
from 30 strokes of the lash, is comment enough on the criticus 
concerning whose nonsense I have sent Dana the requisite 
observations. 661

I wonder whether you have noticed that the Austrians made use

desirable if Lupus did likewise. I know by experience how 
welcome letters from friends are at such a time. I shall write a 
short obituary of our poor friend for the Tribune. So far as the 
German-American Press is concerned, I think the best plan would 
be to insert in the New York Neue Zeit (nominally edited by 
Bernhardt, in fact by Löwe of Calbe) a brief obituary notice signed 
by you, Freiligrath, Lupus and  myself.  Also to denounce the

not for all that ever abandon hope of your excellent husband's 
recovery. His was a sensitive, finely-tuned and altogether noble 
nature—character, talents and physical appearance in rare har­
mony. Seen amongst the others in Cologne, Daniels always seemed 
to me like the statue of a Greek god deposited by some freak of 
fate in the midst of a crowd of Hottentots. His premature decease 
is an irreparable loss not only to his family and friends but also to 
science, in which he gave promise of the finest achievements, and 
to the great, suffering mass of humanity, who possessed in him a 
loyal champion. 
I am sufficiently acquainted with your heroic nature to be 
convinced that imperishable grief will not prevent you from 
remaining the loyal guardian of the beloved pledges left you by 
Roland. In his sons you will compensate the world twice over for 
the loss of the father. 
The news of this new loss has revived in my wife such vivid 
memories of the death of our only little sona that her state of 
mind does not permit of her writing to you just now. She is 
weeping and lamenting like a child. 
Consolation I will not venture to offer you since I myself am 
and shall remain inconsolable for [the] loss of a friend who was 
more dear to me personally than any other. Grief such as this 
cannot be alleviated, but only shared. As soon as I get over my 
first stormy emotions, I shall send an obituary to the New-York 
Tribune for the many friends of the departed in America. It is to 
be hoped that circumstances will some day permit us to wreak 
upon those guilty of cutting short his career vengeance of a kind 
sterner than that of an obituary. 
You will need no assurance on my part that you can always 
count on me as a loyal and devoted friend. 
With my heartfelt sympathy, 
Yours

the parliamentary recess this does not, of course, impair my 
efficiency as a correspondent. This month, therefore, you should 
not put me on your books until 11 September. 
It goes without saying that, should your paper cease to pay yet 
still remain viable, my contributions will be at your disposal then as 
now. 
Considering the difficult circumstances and the limited space at 
your disposal, your paper is, in my opinion, edited with great skill 
and tact, and in such a way that the intelligent reader may read 
between the lines. Nothing can be more fatuous than to censure 
you for receiving 'constitutional' money. Some very 'constitutional' 
citizens paid in shares for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. If these 
gentlemen subsequently came to regret it, they were at least never 
forbidden by the editorial board to go on paying. 
If I were not so afraid of compromising this or that 
acquaintance by the mere fact of corresponding with him, I should 
long since have written to the Rhine Province in the interests of 
your paper. At all events, Lassalle did wrong in failing to draw 
attention to the Neue Oder-Zeitung in Cologne, etc. Circumstances 
would have allowed him to do so. 
Should the N. O.-Z. go under, we shall have to console ourselves 
with the thought that all our present doings, activities and 
beginnings are purely provisional and no more than a pis aller. 
With kindest regards. 
Yours

MARX TO MORITZ ELSNER 
IN BRESLAU 
Manchester, 8 November 1855 
34 Butler Street, Green Keys 
Dear Eisner, 
I have received both your letters,666  the first somewhat belatedly 
because my wife accidentally delayed sending it on to Manchester. 
After receiving your first letter I thought you had resigned from 
the Neue Oder-Zeitung and for that reason at once ceased to send 
any articles. When your second letter arrived I was suffering from 
such a FIT of toothache—which persisted until a few days 
ago—that I could no more write than I could hear or see. 
I passed on your letter of 7 October not only to friends but also 
to adversaries, and the latter seemed thoroughly taken aback. That 
I and my friends are in no way affected by the dogmas of Messrs 
Temme and Simon of Breslau you will readily believe without any 
further assurance from me. 
I do not see Hoyoll, but Lupus does—from time to time. 
Patriotism has led this Hoyoll to introduce the Breslauer Zeitung 
into the Athenaeum 244 here, a circumstance which threatens to 
drive our little  Wolff a out of what is virtually the only home of the 
Muses in Manchester. 
I have conveyed your greetings to Borchardt, whom I know 
well. Borchardt maintains a regular and intimate correspondence 
with Citizen Simon of Breslau. Upon his first asking me whether I 
knew that the N. O.-Z. lived in sin with the constitutionals, I 
replied: 'Qu'est ce que ça me fait? h Don't you know that, in my view, 
constitutionals and democrats, at least of the Prussian variety, are 
all much of a muchness? And is a distinction now to be drawn 
between democrats who have accepted one royal imposition while 
rejecting another and those who, having submitted to the one, also 
submit to the other? 667 The N. O.-Z. expresses the most extreme 
views possible in the present condition of the Press. What more do 
you ask?' 
I have had letters from particularly well-informed people in 
Paris.  According to them, the Empire's stock is sinking lower and

lower. In the faubourgs the slogan, 'Celui-ci s'en ira'* is said to be 
on everyone's lips. Indeed, the gravity of the situation may be 
deduced from two PUBLIC FACTS: the speech made by Rouland, the 
procurateur-général? and Granier de Cassagnac's article in the 
Constitutionnel, 'Sur les terreurs de la Révolution future'. 0 The 
probability of the latter is beyond doubt even to Mr Granier. 
As for the scandal here over the 'refugee question' (Jersey, etc.), 
there's more smoke to it than fire.668  PUBLIC OPINION has definitely 
turned against the GOVERNMENT and, in fact, I believe that this was 
allowed for in the latter's calculations. So crassly, with such 
tragi-comical mouthings, did they accede to Bonaparte's first 
demands, as virtually to demonstrate that further concessions were 
not within the power of an English government. Had they been in 
earnest, they would have shown themselves more adroit and not 
have carried out the grotesque coup so long before the opening of 
Parliament. Palmerston,  OF COURSE,  has no love for the refugees, but 
regards them as wind-bags to be kept to hand so that he may 
occasionally threaten the Continent with a 'Quos ego!' ä His 
ministerial position, by the by, is exceedingly precarious. But it will 
still be difficult to unseat the old fox. 
When you next write, kindly send your letter to my old address, 
28 Dean Street, Soho, London, since I don't know how long I shall 
be remaining here, and letters sent to the above address will in 
any case come into the hands of my wife. Ronge is running 
kindergartens in London along with his wife; Kinkel, no less than 
Johanna, 6 hopes that the revolution will not be unduly precipitate; 
in Brighton, Ruge gives an occasional lecture, leading the English 
to believe that the German language is the most debased of all; 
Tausenau, Meyen et tutti quanti 1 abuse the French emigre 'riff-raff 
(not excluding Victor Hugo) for imperilling the 'right of asylum' 
of these 'officially authorised conspirators'. 
Engels and Lupus send you their warmest regards. I haven't 
seen Borchardt for a fortnight.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN DÜSSELDORF 
Manchester, 8th November 1855 
34 Butler Street, Green Keys 
Dear Lassalle, 
Herewith a very belated answer. In the first place, I did not get 
your letters 669 until later because I was in Manchester whereas the 
letters were in London and my wife did not know for certain 
whether I hadn't already left Manchester. For another thing, I was 
plagued by the most atrocious toothache, so much so that I 
experienced what Hegel demands of sensual consciousness at the 
stage at which it is said to override consciousness of self—viz. the 
inability to hear, see, and therefore also to write. 
As regards your query about the book entitled: Les mystères  de la 
Bourse by Coffinières, I believe that this miserable concoction is 
still among the books I left behind in the fatherland. During my 
first stay in Paris 670 the title misled me first into buying the thing 
and then into reading it. Mr Coffinières is a lawyer who, au fond, 3 
knows nothing about the Bourse and merely warns against the 
'legal' swindles perpetrated by the 'agents de changé? So there's 
nothing to be got out of the book—neither FACTS, nor theory, nor 
yet even entertaining anecdotes. Moreover, it is now completely 
out-of-date. 'Sweet Donna, let him go'—i.e. Coffinières. 'He is not 
worthy of thy wrath'. c 
Weerth is now back in Manchester after a lengthy journey via the 
Continent (he returned from the West Indies at the end of  July).  In a 
week's time he will be off to the tropics again. It's very amusing to 
hear him talk. He has seen, experienced and observed much. 
Ranged over the better part of South, West and Central America. 
Crossed the Pampas on horseback. Climbed Chimborazo. Likewise 
stayed in California. If he no longer writes feuilletons, 671 he makes 
up for it by recounting them, and his audience has the benefit of 
vivacious gesture, mime and waggish laughter. He is, by the by,

word to say for the human riff-raff and the weather of this 
northern clime. And, INDEED, things are bad here, very bad. 
You will have read in the papers about the Jersey affair668 and 
the general to-do over the refugee question in England. I don't 
believe that this affair will take a serious turn. Nor, for that 
matter, do I believe that the government here had a serious end in 
view. Otherwise the row would have been saved up until just 
before the opening of Parliament. As it is, PUBLIC OPINION has been 
given time to swing back and, in many respects, has already done 
so. 
Send your next letter to my old  address  in London as I'm not sure 
how long I shall stay up here with friend Engels. He and Lupus 
send you their warm regards.

a Wecker and with it a note, patently by Cluss, attacking 
Schimmelpfennig. Alas, I used up the Wecker during an 
unconsidered moment in a place where 'hard words, soft paper, 
etc' It contained the assertion that the Germans in America were 
UTILITARIANS and pursued 'bread-and-butter' because 'Mr Marx is 
an economist and an abstruse one'. But in Mr Marx's case this 
could be attributed to the 'Old Testament'. 'By a well-known trick' 
he had 'turned "our relations" into a philosophical system'. That 
thoughtful young Germans in America should follow his lead was 
attributable to the fact that Germans are accustomed 'to echo 
clever writers belonging to the nation of the Old Testament etc' 
Since ABOUT the time of my return here, the Advertiser has been 
the arena for a cockfight between Herzen and an anonymous 
antagonist. His antagonist reproaches him with being a humbug 
and having passed himself off as a kind of Russian Silvio Pellico. a 
Even the title of his book 67S  is said to be a lie, inasmuch as he has 
never been in Siberia, etc. Feeble reply from Herzen b: the title was 
humbug on the PUBLISHER'S part, he [Herzen] had not been 
responsible for it and had immediately protested in the Globe, c etc. 
against the attributes wrongly ascribed to him, etc. Whereupon his 
antagonist came forth again (yesterday) and gave evidence of fresh 
lies, also in respect of the Globe.d Besides this attack, however, 
there was also a DEFENCE put up by an Englishman  e. Even if Herzen 
had not been in Siberia and was no Russian Silvio Pellico, his book 
was nevertheless amusing, an innocuous book: *'an honest man, 
look you, and soon dasht! He is a marvellous good neighbour in 
sooth; and a very good bowler; but, for Alisander, alas, you see, 
how 'tis.'  *f Finally, the  TUB-TUB  PAPER,  as is its wont, declared that the 
contest was becoming too personal, etc., was now over and closed 
its columns to it.g  At all events this skirmish—even though the 
assailants were hardly brilliant—will do Herzen a great deal of

wrong, of course. Throughout the trial one of the jurymen— 
Joest—drew caricatures of the accused, and passed the drawings 
round in court. During the first week the worthy jeune* Saedt 
always had a dagger lying in front of him. At length the ironical 
laughter of the accused compelled him to 'wear the dagger under 
his gown'. b Can one imagine a more affected COXCOMB? Saedt with a

I almost forgot the most important point. A few weeks ago, 3 I 
THINK, Zitschke came to see my wife. The conversation turned to 
Mirbach.d  QUOTH  Zitschke: 'That old loafer had a splendid chance 
of a passage. I had thought him long since at sea. Then I found 
him sitting again at a table in Bibra's pothouse and looking very 
down-at-heel.' Liebknecht, too, claims to have seen him recently.

Something can be arranged with the good Tribune people after

The STRIKE is going ahead here. The MASTERS said that they were 
willing to pay/ provided the Ashton rates were taken as a basis. 
The HANDS replied that if the MASTERS chose Ashton, they would 
choose Oldham and be prepared to accept as a basis the average 
for the two places. Thereupon the MASTERS gave an evasive answer 
and proposed yet a third place in the district as a norm. This was 
refused and there the matter rests. The HANDS seem to me to be 
completely in the right; but they obviously still have in mind a few 
old trade union traditions whereby only this or that machine may 
be operated and only in the specific, time-honoured manner. But 
they'll soon drop this rubbish. The neighbourhood is beginning to 
support them.

mention some shabby trick, he listens with attention and asks 
questions which show a desire to know. I shall gradually

DEAR  Frederic, 
This confinement to my room is beginning to weigh on me. Not 
one breath of fresh air yet. Meanwhile, another 1,000 Germans 
sent off yesterday. Jones supposed to be coming today, at last. 
The day before yesterday evening I had a visit, you'll never 
guess from whom. Edgar Bauer—whom I hadn't seen for about a 
year—came to see me, and with him—Bruno. He's already been 
here a fortnight and intends to remain  ABOUT  6 MONTHS 'in order to 
prove his assumptions' which he can hardly fail to do, considering 
the way he's begun. The man has aged visibly, his forehead has 
broadened and the impression he now gives is more or less that of 
a pedantic old professor. For the present he is lodging with Edgar 
in a hovel SOMEWHERE ABOUT the far end of Highgate and there he 
squats, amidst the most profound petty-bourgeois misère, seeing 
and hearing nothing. This he takes to be London and believes 
that, apart from the privileged 30,000, all the English live like 
Edgar Bauer. Hence his hatred and 'contempt' for the country is 
enormous. In his view, it's like living in "Treuenbrietzen'. 3 To 
anyone coming from 'Berlin', London is a veritable 'prison'. On 
the same occasion it also transpired that his present ideal is the 
'East Frisian', 'Altenburgian' and PARTLY 'Westphalian peasant,15 
those true noblemen. He is, moreover, convinced that these 
clodhoppers cannot be wished away and will be the ROCKS upon 
which the modern, egalitarian fiddle-faddle, bemoaned by this 
man of the 'dissolution', will come to  grief.  It was most CURIOUS to 
hear the 'Criticism'678 make the CONFESSION that, in the final analysis,

peasant and Bauer the name of Edgar.

Berthold Auerbach is its true cornerstone. He holds that, save for 
a few 'purely commercial towns', the towns of Germany are in 
decline, but that 'the country' is prospering fabulously. He knew 
not a thing about the rise of industry, but quietly bemoaned the 
fact that nothing is now being done in Germany save 'IMPROVEMENTS'. 
The 'English language' is 'wretched', completely romanicised. 
For his consolation I proceeded to tell him that the Dutch and the 
Danes say the same of the German language and claim that the 
only fellows to have remained truly untainted by Romance are the 
'Icelanders'. 
The old boy has devoted much time to languages. He speaks 
Polish and declares in consequence the Polish language to be 'the 
most beautiful of all'. His linguistic studies seem to have been 
highly uncritical. He considers Dobrovsky, for instance, to be a far 
'more important man' than Grimm,a  and calls him the father of 
comparative linguistics. Moreover, he has let the Poles in Berlin 
persuade him that  OLD  Lelewel has refuted Grimm's Geschichte der 
deutschen Sprache in a recent paper. 
Apropos. He also told me that a fat volume (of German 
provenance) had appeared in Germany attacking Grimm's dictio­
nary.15 The whole volume consists of howlers G[rimm] is shown to 
have perpetrated. 
Despite all his efforts to adopt a humorous attitude, his gloom 
and despondency over the 'present' kept obtruding. In Ger­
many— HORRIBLE INDEED!—nothing is now read or bought save 
miserable compilations in the field of the natural sciences. When 
you come,679 we shall have great fun with the old boy. 
Koppen has been working for years on a book on Buddhism. 680 
Rutenberg is the publisher of the Staats-Anzeiger. Mr Bergenroth, 
who used to drift about America (North and South) as commis­
sioner (trade), has returned sans argent" but with an illness. 
I am still waiting for the 2nd edition of The Times or Morning 
Post. The news may make it necessary to couch the thing on Kars 
in somewhat more hypothetical terms. However, this would only 
require quite minor alterations (a few words in the conditional). 6 ' 
I, for my part, believe that Kars has fallen.

JENNY MARX TO FREDERICK ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, 7 January 1852] a 
Dear Mr Engels, 
How can you imagine that I would have been angry with you 
over that little drinking spree? I was very sorry not to have seen 
you again before you left, for that would have enabled you to see 
for yourself that I was only somewhat sulky in respect of my liege 
lord. Besides, such interludes often have quite salutory effects, but 
this time père Marx must have caught a bad chill during his 
nocturnal philosophic excursion with 'the archbishop's nephew', b 
for he fell seriously ill and has up till now stayed quietly in bed. 
He may perhaps be able to get up a little today and apply himself 
to the articles for America.0  However, I don't think he is as much 
restored as he imagines. For three nights he rambled in his speech 
and was very poorly. He asks you to convey his regards to Weerth 
and to tell him that he was very annoyed with him for having 
written no more than 2 words when forwarding Reinhardts letter 
from Paris, and that he must above all fulfil his duty as a former 
editor of the Neue Rheinische and send out to America some 
articles from stock. 682 As for that insufferable man,d  here, word 
for word, is what père Marx says now: 
'Ever drunk as a lord; boasting about his insinuating ways with 
women, meaning his being kicked out of bars; from the outset 
raucously inciting the English public in streets and alleyways, 
PARLOURS, omnibuses and HAPENNYSTEAMBOATS, to take part in the great 
debates between Kinkel and Ruge; dragging every German by the 
ear to the Cranbourne Hotel; one of the most pompous ranters of 
a This date is established on the basis of Engels' letter to Marx of 6 January 1852 
(see this volume, pp. 4-5). When Engels was putting his archives in order he dated 
it 'Beginning of January 1852'. - b A humorous reference to Engels. - c K. Marx, 
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. - d Lüders

the Emigrés' Club, 26 and hence also crudely venting his spleen on 
the out-of-the-way little church of the N. Rh. Z. Should he ask 
Weerth's protection, the latter must tell him to look for a post in 
one of the seven ministries to be set up by Kinkel, which should 
not present any difficulty in view of his great services to the great 
and only revolutionary party and of his influence on Kinkel's pair 
of court scribes, Meyen and Oppenheim. Generally speaking, 
should Weerth be approached by any of the blackguards, he must 
give them to understand that he, too, belongs to the "small, 
incorrigible, separatist church" of the N. Rh. Z, as Meyen put it 
when writing to America.' 
So much for my exalted patient, 'old Crosspatch'. 
Yesterday a very nice letter arrived from Cluss in Washington, 
from which Kinkel's boundless turpitude again emerges. Unfortu­
nately I cannot enclose it as Freiligrath took it away with him 
yesterday. We shall send it tomorrow. Pass on bits of it to Weerth. 
Freiligrath has a new story about Kinkel's toadyism towards the 
democratic grocers here, which I shall now treat you to. 
Freiligrath applies to a blind German democratic merchant here 
for a position. He acquaints him with his commercial testimonials, 
whereupon the cross-eyed cheesemonger tells him: 'I have had the 
privilege of making Professor Kinkel's acquaintance. I attended 
one of his lectures, after which the Professor called on me and at 
once offered to come to my house of an evening and read aloud 
free of charge the best German poetic works. I, of course, 
declined this exceptional offer, not being in a position adequately 
to reward a man like Professor Kinkel for such services. In 
addition, the gentleman would have had the expense of the 
omnibus fares, since he lives some distance away. Nevertheless, the 
Professor came and read aloud to me from German poets.— 
Amongst which a few little things by  yourself,  Mr Freiligrath— 
whereupon he told me that you were really a man of commerce 
and had already held a position, etc., etc. The Professor's wife a 
also called on me and offered to sing and play to me.'—Doubtless 
the Professor's wife would also have obliged with dances and poses 
plastiques* had she not been dealing with a blind connoisseur. 
The future president of the German Republic, who goes chasing 
after the grocers here in order to read them his divine poetry and 
sometimes snatch a bite of supper, all but outshines the French

It will also interest you to hear that your former  chief,  General 
Willich, has received a sound thrashing at the hands of the 
inferior refugees, since the latter are unable to grasp the 
difference between themselves and the superior refugees, and 
disapprove of the way the large revolutionary funds are being 
administered in the interests of the great men. It would further 
appear from Cluss' letter that Kinkel has used Willich's MYSTIFICA­
TIONS  and Schramm's letter 10 to provide proof in America of their 
connections with Cologne. It will soon be time to come out with 
the true story. Kinkel has apparently been putting about in 
America too that Marx's party presents prizes for vice in order not 
to become moral heroes. Musch sends Frederick his love. The girls 
have already gone to school. You will, perhaps, remember that 
Pieper made the boy a present of his fine travelling bag. Yesterday 
he threatened to take it back and buy him something else instead. 
This morning the boy hid the bag, and just now he said: 'Moor, a 
I've hiddened it well and if Pieper asks for it, I'll tell him I've 
given it to a poor man.' The slyboots! 
Adieu.

[London, 9 January 1852] 
Dear Mr Weydemeyer, 
For the past week my husband has been very poorly and is for 
the most part confined to bed. Nevertheless he has managed to 
finish the enclosed sequel to his article,b so that there may be no

interruption in the printing  thereof,  supposing a start has really 
been made on it. 
A few days ago we had a letter from Cluss in Washington—with 
whom I hope you have already made contact for you will find him 
in all respects an excellent support—from which Kinkel's bound­
less turpitude again emerges. For while this hypocrite fawns on 
Karl's friends in the most barefaced manner and writes to them, 
saying 'he has emphasised the need to get in touch with Marx and 
the most capable members of his party' (a downright lie), he seeks 
in the most perfidious way to blacken my husband's personal character 
and relates the most edifying tales about him and his friends 
drawn from Willich's mendacious innuendoes. 
Karl, who doesn't feel strong enough today to write to you 
himself,  asks me to tell you that you should provide some 
information in your paper3 about our poor friends in Cologne,b 
the more so since Kinkel's party, along with its court scribes and 
its rowdies and its compliant Lithographische Korrespondenz, deliber­
ately passes over their existence and all their sufferings in 
complete silence, which is all the more infamous as it is precisely 
to Becker, c Bürgers and their erstwhile organ d that Kinkel owes 
most of his popularity. But our people languish in prisons, are 
hideously treated, and now will have to spend another three 
months in jug while the great men of the future are pocketing 
thousands in the name of the revolution and are already handing 
out future ministerial posts. 
How was your dear wifee after the terrible voyage? What are 
your children doing? Have they all become more or less 
acclimatised?683 
But time is getting exceedingly short. I must hurry out and post 
this letter. Let us hope that the conclusion of his article will be 
easier for my dear Karl. 
Farewell for the present, 
Yours

Dear Mr Engels, 
As you see, I am still en fonctionh  as secretary. My husband has 
still not altogether left his bed. He was indeed very poorly. 
Tomorrow he will attempt to take a short walk. His illness 
prevented him from getting anything done for America, although 
he did manage to strike some sparks out of Freiligrath and Pieper. 
I enclose herewith a most felicitous poem of Freiligrath's.' Let our 
friend Weerth have a look at it as well. Perhaps he too will feel 
inspired to climb onto Pegasus. Send us the Tribune if you have 
finished with it. Next week you will receive a very nice letter from 
Cluss.  Lupus hasn't got it just now. We hope to hear from you 
soon and may you enjoy your PALE ALE in the meantime.

JENNY MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 684 
IN NEW YORK 
[London, 27 February 1852] 
Dear Mr Weydemeyer, 
After a week of strenuous nocturnal labours, his days being 
taken up with domestic affairs, my husband's eyes are so 
wretchedly sore that he cannot possibly write to you today and I 
must assume all secretarial functions. He asks me to tell you that 
he has been unable to read through the whole of Eccarius' article, 3 
and that you yourself must correct the orphographic mistakes; for 
this admirable man, who writes excellently, has only just learnt his 
letters here and knows nothing of full-stops and commas. He is 
also sending you an article by a Hungarian b  who is familiar with 
the innermost secrets of the Hungarian émigrés. You yourself 
must decide whether you can use and publish it at this moment. 
At all events, it is essential to keep in with the man, since he has 
promised to provide us later on with original contributions by 
Perczel, Szemere, etc., whose intimate he is. My husband thinks 
you should, of course, correct the worst grammatical howlers that 
crop up in the article, but that a few peculiarities of style which 
might give it the stamp of a genuine Hungarian product could do 
no harm at all. He further requests you to return as' soon as 
possible the five instalments of his paper on Napoleon c if you 
should not succeed in publishing it. We might, perhaps, be able to 
bring it out in a French translation, although it would really be a 
pity about the German version. He would greatly prefer it if you 
could succeed in America, since the piece is bound to sell and 
could also be distributed in Germany, providing as it does an 
historical appreciation of the most important event of the present 
day. I hope that there will soon be some good news from you, 
dear Mr Weydemeyer, to wit that your dear wife has come 
smoothly through the great catastrophe, and that two births have 
taken place under your roof—a son and a journal. My very 
warmest greetings to your dear wife. 
Yours

JENNY MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 
IN WASHINGTON 
London, 15 October 1852 
Dear Mr Cluss, 
Today my husband has appointed me his deputy and I 
therefore hasten to assume the duties of a secrétaire  intime. For my 
husband is under such PRESSURE FROM WITHOUT AND WITHIN that he has 
had to traipse round all day on  HOME  BUSINESS  and now, just gone 5, 
has not yet returned to dispose, more especially, of the affair 
Briiningk v. Cluss. a Do nothing, absolutely nothing about this matter 
until the next STEAMER. Imandt had meant to send a statement 
today proving that Willich and Kinkel had made insulting remarks 
about Mrs Briiningk. At the same time he will lay the blame for all 
the tittle-tattle at the door of that old buffoon, Ruge, presently 
knight-errant and champion of princely innocence, and will do so 
all the more easily as the rumour indeed arose and began to 
spread at the very moment when the old jackass declared Kinkel 
to be—witness his close friend Gross—an agent of the Prince of 
Prussia, b at the same time revealing that Kinkel's release had been

the prince's doing, but that Mrs Brüningk had also played a 
leading role in the affair and had put up the money for it. In 
Germany, these rumours were both current at once and (if 
Dronke's memory is to be trusted, though he cannot say for 
certain) it is said that in the self-same article Ruge spoke of the 
suspect circles frequented here by Gottfried. Well, this stupid 
affair is nothing but a conspiracy to avenge themselves on 
Marx-Cluss by imputing to them vile, anonymous gossip and 
slander—an art in which these curs have long since been 
practising with the greatest virtuosity. No sooner had the old 
Pomeranian 3 broken a lance for the princess than he paid a 
personal call on the great lady. No doubt Heinzen, too, still hopes 
to supplement his Whiggish sourceb by striking and exploiting a 
princely seam over here for his Janus. But how ridiculous, the way 
in which the rabble suddenly raises a hue and cry in two 
continents when, for so long, it has heaped scurrility upon 
scurrility, tittle-tattle upon tittle-tattle, calumny upon calumny. 
And withal there is really nothing to the article 50  which, at least, 
reveals in moderate, discreet, indeed veiled terms, what has been 
said bluntly and openly by her own guests. The revolting thing 
about it is that one would sooner keep this scum at a healthy 
distance than be forced to grapple with them, and over so paltry a 
matter to boot. My husband himself had intended to send you 
today an article written in his own name about how your article 
came to be published in the Wecker. But Imandt thought it 
absolutely essential that my husband, against whom the whole 
thing has been cooked up, should be left out of it, which is why he 
wanted to write the statement  himself.  Unfortunately it has not yet 
arrived! But you should do nothing about the matter until you 
receive further instructions. Meyen was saying today that Dronke, 
Willich and Kinkel had stated on their word of honour that they 
had never said anything defamatory about the woman. So the

my husband's lips were sealed by party considerations and out of 
regard for his friends in Germany. 
Did anyone bother whether all this grieved me almost to death, 
when my child2 died, having imbibed at my breast torment, grief 
and care?—oh! and all the other sufferings—yet I was not called 
princess when I was born—but wherefore all this foolish 
commotion? We shall extricate ourselves somehow and prove the

required in dealing with this bunch of purely objective, principled, 
honourable, worthy washerwomen. 
You have, I suppose, been following the Cologne trial in the 
Kölnische. Today we received an account of Becker's f interroga­
tion. Since there was nothing against him, it had been agreed to 
leave Becker out of the thing altogether,8 and this will explain to 
you the manner of his defence, which will be eagerly seized upon 
by the democrats in order to claim Becker as one of their own and 
declare him the true hero—free, independent man of the people 
that he is and no blind follower of a secret society's cut-and-dried 
doctrine—, precisely because he is the weakest of all and has the 
greatest amount of democratic blood in his veins. Should that 
loud-mouthed Heinzen make use of this case to build up Becker, 
you can at once point out that the defence had been agreed upon 
beforehand and that, shortly before his arrest, Becker had 
insistently begged my husband to attack with him in his review685

JENNY MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS ,2 
IN WASHINGTON 
[London, 30 October 1852] 
Dear Mr Cluss, 
You will have been following the monster trial of the 
communists in the Kölnische Zeitung. During the sitting of 23 
October the whole thing took such a splendid and interesting turn, 
and one so favourable to the accused, that we are beginning to 
regain some of our confidence. 686 As you can imagine, the 'Marx 
party' is busy day and night and is having to throw itself into the 
work body and soul. This overloading with work also accounts for 
my again appearing before you as deputy reporter. Mr Willich's 
close friend, Mr Dietz, now also in America, has contrived to have 
all the documents, letters, minutes, etc., etc. of Willich's clique 
stolen from him. They were produced by the prosecution as 
evidence of the party's dangerous activities. In order to establish a Printed according to the original

link between these and the accused, they now proceeded to think 
up a spurious connection between my husband and the notorious 
spy Cherval. Thus my husband became the bridge, the spurious 
link, between the theoreticians of Cologne and the men of action, 
incendiaries and robbers, in London. Stieber and the prosecution 
expected wonders of this coup. It burst like a bubble. New effects 
had to be conjured up, hence the tissue of lies at the sitting of 23 
October. Everything adduced by the police is untrue. They steal, 
forge, break into desks, perjure themselves, bear false witness and, 
withal, claim this licence vis-à-vis communists, who are hors [de] la 
société**.  This and the way in which the police, at their most 
rascally, are usurping all the functions of the prosecution, pushing 
Saedt into the background, and submitting unattested scraps of 
paper, mere rumours, reports and hearsay, as real legally proven 
facts,  as evidence, is truly hair-raising. We here had to supply all 
proofs of the forgery. Hence my husband had to work all day and 
late into the night. Affidavits had to be obtained from the 
publicans, and the handwriting of the alleged minute-takers, 
Liebknecht and Rings, officially authenticated to provide proof of 
forgery on the part of the police. Then every one of these things 
had to be copied out 6-8 times and dispatched by the most divers 
routes to Cologne, via Frankfurt, Paris, etc., since all letters to my 
husband as well as all letters from here to Cologne b are opened 
and detained. The whole thing has now become a struggle 
between the police on one side and my husband on the 
other—they blame him for everything, the entire revolution and 
even the conduct of the trial. Finally Stieber has now declared my 
husband to be an Austrian spy. In return, my husband looked out 
a glorious letter, written to him by Stieber in the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung days, which is really damning. c We likewise discovered a 
letter from Becker in which he makes fun of Willich's imbecilities 
and his 'military conspiracies'.*1  Out of hatred for Becker, Willich 
gave directions here in London to the witness Lieutenant Hentze, 
from whom up till now he has been receiving alms. In short, 
things are about to happen which would seem unbelievable if one 
wasn't experiencing them  oneself.  All this business with the police 
is distracting the public, and hence the jury, from the actual 
prosecution of the communists, while bourgeois hatred of the 
dreadful incendiaries is paralysed by the HORROR inspired by the 
villainy of the police,—so much so that we can now even believe in 
a outside society - b London in the original - c See this volume, pp. 225-

our friends' acquittal. The struggle against official power, armed 
as this is with money and every kind of weapon, is not, of course, 
without interest and will be all the more glorious should we 
emerge the victors. For on their side there is money, power and 
everything else, whereas we were often at a loss where to get the 
paper on which to write our letters, etc., etc. 
The enclosed statement was issued today by Freiligrath, Marx, 
Engels and Wolff. 3 We are sending it to the Tribune today. You 
could publish it as well.b 
Excuse me for such a confused letter but I, too, have had some 
part in the intrigue and have done so much copying that my 
fingers are afire. Hence the muddle. Your essay in the Turn-
Zeitungc has been much applauded here. My husband thought it 
first-rate and the style, in particular, exceptionally brilliant. There 
are others who prefer you in a less theoretical vein and would like 
you always to remain the same old humorous, light-hearted Cluss. 
We have just received from Weerth and Engels whole parcels 
full of commercial addresses and pseudo-commercial letters so that 
we can send off the documents, letters, etc. d687 
Another load of tremendous scandal has just arrived with the 
Kölnische. Two further packages are being dispatched at once to 
commercial addresses. A complete office has now been set up in 
our house. Two or three people are writing, others running 
errands, others scraping PENNIES together so that the writers may 
continue to exist and prove the old world of officialdom guilty of the 
most outrageous scandal. And in between whiles my 3 merry 
children e sing and whistle, often to be harshly told off by their papa. 
What a bustle! Farewell, dear Mr Cluss, and write again soon to your 
friends.

JENNY MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS 688 
IN WASHINGTON 
London, 10 March [1853] 
For weeks my dear Karl has been indisposed and, during the 
past few days, has again been suffering from his old liver 
complaint which almost developed into hepatitis, a disease I find 
all the more frightening for its being hereditary in his family and 
the cause of his father's death." Today he is better again, is getting 
his Tribune article into shape,b and has asked me to write to you. I 
must at once plunge into a circumstantial tale of woe which almost 
equals the bad luck of Weydemeyer and Cluss.689 Please don't be 
angry with me if I dilate. On 6 December, at the same time as 
your manuscript copy of the Revelations," my husband sent another 
one to Schabelitz's son in Basle. Schabelitz was delighted to receive 
it, wrote saying it was a masterpiece, that it ought to be across the 
border within a fortnight and that he would run off 2,000 copies, 
sell them at 15 silver groschen a piece and, after deducting the 
printing costs (low in Switzerland), share the profits with my 
husband. We would be justified in counting on at least £30 
sterling—with no risk of disappointment. Moreover he intended 
to send 40 copies to London immediately. For 4 weeks we hear 
nothing. My husband writes. Answer: the printing was held up by 
the compositors' Christmas junketing; he intends to be across the 
border in a fortnight at the latest and to send us 40 copies. All we 
hear, and this through a third party, is that the smuggling 
operation has run into unexpected difficulties and that he has had 
to smuggle across the 1,800 copies in small parcels over a period 
of 14 days, but that everything will be across by about the 
beginning of February, when he will charge one of his own clerks 
with forwarding the pamphlet and distributing it to the booksellers 
and will send him there, but that he, however, will send us a 
specimen copy at once. Good. We wait expectantly for 4 weeks. Then 
my husband writes to inquire, believing that the pamphlets have long 
since reached the furthest corners of Germany and that all he need 
now do is draw a bill on him. Then, yesterday, the following letter 
arrived.d 
a Heinrich Marx - b Probably Marx's and Engels' 'British Politics.—Disraeli.—The 
Refugees.— Mazzini in London.—Turkey'. - c K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the 
Communist Trial in Cologne. - d See also this volume, p. 287.

'Dear Marx, I have just heard that the whole consignment of Revelations, 
amounting to 2,000 copies, which had been lying in a village on the other side of the 
border for the past 6 weeks, was intercepted yesterday while being conveyed 
elsewhere. What will happen now, I do not know; first of all, a complaint lodged by 
the Baden government with the Federal Council, then, no doubt, my arrest or at 
least commitment for trial,etc. In either case, a terrific shindy! This briefly for your 
information; further communications, should I be prevented from making them 
myself,  will reach you through a 3rd party. When writing to me, use the address: A 
modiste in Basle, etc' 
That's all; what do you think of it? He leaves 2,000 copies, i.e. 
the entire edition, lying in a village for 6 weeks, and then writes to 
tell us that they have been confiscated. Not a word about the 
copies for London, nothing about those for Switzerland, etc. Have 
the things been printed, did the Prussian police buy them for a 
hefty sum, or God knows what? Suffice it to say that this is the 
2nd pamphlet to have been entirely suppressed.690  Mr Stieber, who 
has become Chief of Police in Berlin and announced a magnum 
opus on conspiracies/ etc., and Mr Willich, owner and adminis­
trator of the American funds, 691 come out of the affair sain et 
sauf 3; the Cologne trial has been utterly obliterated, the party is 
still not quite cleansed of all taint, and the government is 
triumphant! At this moment the pamphlet would have had the 
most tremendous effect. The hearts of the German police would 
have quaked and trembled at this THUNDERBOLT falling among them. 
If we had the means, we would have it printed again au moment 0 
in Altona in order to enrage the government, but that is 
impossible. All that can be done now is for you to bring it out as a 
feuilleton in some paper or other. Could not the type then be 
used to produce a pamphlet which you could at once send over 
here? Since printing in Europe has become almost impossible but 
is now entirely a matter of honour for the party, you should at 
least have it printed à tout prix 6 as a feuilleton. The publication of 
the pamphlet is now a necessity as against all our enemies, and 
will, more than anything else, further the interests of the Cologne 
people and sway public opinion in their favour. Interest in them 
must be reawakened. Becker's' attempted escape failed only 
because of lack of interest and outside help. Above all, proof of 
the pamphlet's existence must be given and this can only be done 
by its being printed, even if only as a feuilleton on the other side 
of the ocean.

It is for me a hateful task to have to write to you about money

have no other recourse, no other way out. I have written to Hagen 
in Bonn, to Georg Jung, to Cluss, to my mother-in-law, 3 to my

single one of them. So there's no other course left open to us. I 
cannot describe what things are like here. My husband has gone to 
the City to see Gerstenberg. You can imagine what kind of an 
errand that must be for him. Meanwhile I am writing these lines. 
Can you send us something? The baker warned us that there'd be 
no more bread after Friday. Yesterday when he asked: 'Is MR 
MARX  AT HOME?' Musch managed to fend him off by answering: 'No, 
HE ANT UPSTAIRS' and then, with three loaves tucked under his arm, 
shot off like an arrow to tell his Moor about it.

... Marx has written me a very jolly letter in which he says that 
everyone was greatly amused by my description of the doings of 
Willich, that 'brother of the guild of misery'. 693 He says that, amid 
peals of Homeric laughter, they resolved en grand comité 3 to wish 
his 'life' as unhampered a course as possible. He remarks: 'If the 
lunacy of this drôle h were not intermixed and interlarded with 
cunning calculations as to how best to fill his belly without doing 
any work, he would long since have found his way to the lunatic 
asylum.' In return for my report, Marx is going to send me in his 
next a copy of the passage relating to Willich in The Great Men of 
the Exile.

translation; if you or I or someone else will undertake to translate 
it, and if we let him know where he left off, he will take upon 
himself to write the whole of the conclusion.694  Marx is of the 
opinion that as a pamphlet, the thing will not sell, and certainly 
not pay for  itself;  he would be perfectly satisfied with a feuilleton.

... Today received a letter from Marx's wife which unfortunately 
I would seem to have placed outside my pocket when on the 
omnibus. Marx had just returned from Manchester (20th May).696 
He is delighted with your Reform article3; likewise your introduc­
tionb to Hirsch's statement.6  Marx's only regret is that not all our 
things are able to appear under your auspices, but that the names 
of the two ciphers from the Hornisse must be given precedence. 
Otherwise he is satisfied with the Reform. Dronke has at last 
obtained a post as clerk in Bradford at £10 a month. 
Pieper would appear to have been shown the door by 
Rothschild 6 some time ago; the part he played in the communist 
trial makes it difficult for him to find a berth elsewhere. 
Rothschild, was at university with him, has paid him nothing to 
date,  but would do so if he possibly could; Pieper must see to this 
au moment' having no other recourse. 
Eccarius is still not restored. 
Lupus, due to PRESSURE FROM WITHOUT, is very ill disposed... 
The Tribune leaders on the EASTERN QUESTION are all by Marx; he 
wrote them without adding any of the usual NEWS trivialities so that 
Dana went and changed some of the longer historical expositions, 
etc., into Tribunese and published them as LEADERS^ The Tribune is a 
well-spring from which Marx cannot afford to cut himself off, hence 
he intends to turn a blind eye and would rather we didn't make any 
direct reference to the fact, even though he resents it—, that 
his more objective  LOOKING  pieces appear without his name, while 
the articles that do appear under his own name are no more than

making use of one of his letters, saying that I shouldn't get such 
silly ideas into my head.698  Though in no way given to flattery he 
had found that I only made use of his letters on rare occasions

and his address has been mislaid. Nor was it known to Kossuth, 
whom we approached indirectly. A messenger has just left for 
Whitechapel. Unluckily for the gallant Willich, the man has been 
back here for some months, possesses a certificate signed by 
Kossuth to the effect that he fought in the Hungarian campaign, 
and will now be able to provide a first-hand account of the duel. 00 
Père is BUSY with the next instalment of the Palmerston articled

Just received 1 letter from Marx, dated  28TH  NOV. Dronke, it 
seems, has sent you a statement which you should hold back if it is 
not already too late.a Dronke was supposed to send this statement 
to Marx in London, instead of which he sent it to you in New 
York. 
Marx has answered Willich at length,* 3 in very learned, 'Hegelian' 
fashion. Splendid, so far as I can see, and plentifully buttressed 
with documents; I shall probably send you the thing tomorrow, 
but haven't yet had time to read it through, and so do not know 
what to do with it. It is voluminous. 20 pages of LARGE NOTE-PAPER. 
Marx had already written it when my letter arrived informing him 
that we were taking care of the answer/ He now considers that, 
since it isn't every day one meets with such a lying codger as 
Willich, it would be RATHER DISAGREEABLE if the thing had to be 
shelved. He authorises me to make deletions if his article repeats 
what we have already said, or conflicts with ours in matters of 
detail. 
More about this when I send you the thing. 
The accompanying letter, dashed off in great haste, partly by 
Monsieur and partly by Madame Marx,701 concludes as follows: 
'Yesterday evening  (27TH  Nov.) the Waschlapskis and Schelmufs-
kisd held a meeting.702 Harney was IN THE CHAIR. The PEOPLE almost 
tore him to pieces. DOWN, DOWN, RASCAL, TRAITOR, RENEGADE, and he 
wasn't permitted to TAKE THE CHAIR. PEOPLE jumped onto the 
platform, everyone was belabouring everyone else, the Schelmufs-
kis acted as Harney's GUARDS.' 
Again: 'As regards the Reform, Karl has done everything in his 
power. Pieper, driven by necessity, has gone to work in a French 
SHOP,  where he sells sunshine, i.e. the newly-invented lampe 
réverbère!"  He cannot write just now. Accordingly Karl has roped in 
Heise and given him a subscription to the reading room since he 
hadn't got the required penny. He has also written to Germany 
asking for help.'

rheumatic pains in his teeth, ears and face, so severe that he hasn't 
been able to sleep a single night and today feels seriously

terrible pain. Not until tonight was some sweating induced by 
Spanish fly, opium, etc., and a slight improvement noticeable. He's 
not in a condition to put pen to paper, but urgently begs you,

NOTES 
1 This letter was first published in English considerably abridged in Karl Marx 
and Frederick Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895. A selection. International 
Publishers, New York, 1953.—3, 27, 303 
2 This refers to Chapter I of Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, 
which Marx wrote from December 1851 to March 1852, immediately following 
the coup d'état in France on 2 December 1851 (see present edition, Vol. 11, 
Note 64). It is closely linked with other works by Marx and Engels analysing the 
1848-49 revolution in France (Engels' Letters from France, Marx's Class Struggles 
in France, 1848 to 1850, see present edition, Vol. 10) and was originally 
intended as a series of articles in the weekly Die Revolution, which Joseph 
Weydemeyer began preparing in December 1851 for publication in New York. 
Marx and Engels considered this journal highly important for the 
dissemination of scientific communism and took great pains to provide 
Weydemeyer with material. They sent him their own articles and those of their 
associates—Ernest Jones, Wilhelm Pieper, Johann Georg Eccarius, Ferdinand 
Freiligrath, Wilhelm Wolff and others. In connection with the forthcoming 
publication of the journal the Tum-Zeitung, No. 3, carried the following 
announcement on 1 January 1852: 'Die Revolution, a weekly journal edited by 
J. Weydemeyer, associate editor of the Neue Deutsche Zeitung suppressed by the 
police in Frankfurt am Main, is published every Saturday in co-operation with 
the editorial board of the former Neue Rheinische Zeitung (K. Marx, Fr. Engels, 
Freiligrath, etc.)'. 
Weydemeyer managed to put out only two issues (on 6 and 13 January 
1852),  following which publication ceased for lack of funds. The first issue 
reproduced part of 'Review, May to October 1850' published by Marx and 
Engels in 1850 in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue (see 
present edition, Vol. 10), and also announced the forthcoming publication of 
Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and 'Neuste Offenbarungen des 
Sozialismus oder "Idée générale de la Révolution au XIX e siècle, par 
P. J. Proudhon". Kritik von K. M.' (the latter was not written by Marx). The 
second issue carried the rest of the 'Review' and part of Chapter II of the 
Manifesto of the Communist Party (see present edition, Vol. 6).

Weydemeyer received Chapter I of The Eighteenth Brumaire, mentioned 
here,  as well as the rest of the work, when publication had ceased, but with the 
help of Adolf Cluss he succeeded in bringing out two more issues of the 
'non-periodic journal' Die Revolution in May and June 1852 which carried this 
work and satirical poems by Ferdinand Freiligrath (see Note 13). 
Weydemeyer failed to buy up from the printer even half of the 1,000 copies 
of the work printed. Only about 150 copies were sent to Europe, and 
approximately the same number sold in the USA in 1852 and 1853. Cluss and 
other associates of Marx in the past revolutionary struggle in Germany (Johann 
Schickel, Conrad Schramm, Franz Arnold and others) greatly contributed to 
disseminate his work among former subscribers to Die Revolution in Philadel­
phia, Baltimore, Richmond, Cincinnati, Washington and other large cities.—3, 
391 
3 Wilhelm and Ferdinand Wolff intended to write articles for Die Revolution. In a 
letter of 19 December 1851 Marx promised Weydemeyer (see present edition, 
Vol. 38, p. 519) to send him by the next steamer the following material: 1. The 
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte by K. Marx; 2. Der Staatsstreich in 
Frankreich by Ferdinand  Wolff;  3. Nemesis by Wilhelm  Wolff.  Weydemeyer 
announced this in the first issue of Die Revolution on 6 January 1852, being 
unaware as yet of Marx's decision not to publish Ferdinand Wolff's article.— 3 
4 The reference is to the progressive newspaper, the New-York Daily Tribune, to 
which Marx contributed from August 1851 to March 1862. A large number of 
articles for this paper were written at his request by Engels, Marx beginning to 
send his own articles to New York only in August 1852. He wrote the first ones 
in German, and his friends, generally Engels, translated them into English. By 
the end of January 1853 he started writing his contributions in English. 
Marx's and Engels' articles in the New-York Daily Tribune dealt with major 
questions of foreign and home policy, the working-class movement, the 
economic development of European countries, colonial expansion, and the 
national liberation movement in oppressed and dependent countries. The 
articles at once attracted attention by their factual information, acute political 
judgment and brilliant style. This was acknowledged by the editors of the 
Tribune, who wrote, in a leading article on 7 April 1853, of the need 'to pay a 
tribute to the remarkable ability of the correspondent'. They went on: 'Mr 
Marx has very decided opinions of his own, with some of which we are far 
from agreeing; but those who do not read his letters neglect one of the most 
instructive sources of information on the great questions of current European 
politics.' In a letter to Mrs Marx of 1 July 1853, Charles Dana, one of the 
editors, wrote that her husband's articles were highly thought of by the Tribune 
owners and the reading public. 
Articles by Marx and Engels were widely disseminated in America, many of 
them being reprinted in the Tribune's special editions—the New-York Weekly 
Tribune and the New-York Semi-Weekly Tribune. Some of the Tribune's articles 
were translated into German and published in German-language American 
newspapers. Marx's and Engels' articles in the Tribune were also read in 
Europe. From 1853 to 1855 Marx wrote regularly for the newspaper sending, 
as a rule, one or two contributions every week. 
Sometimes the editors of the New-York Daily Tribune tampered with Marx's 
and Engels' articles, publishing them as editorial leaders and occasionally 
making insertions in the text. In 1855 all Marx's and Engels' articles were 
published without the authors' names. Marx repeatedly protested against such 

=====第627页=====
Notes 595 
practices but his financial circumstances compelled him to accept the editors' 
terms (see, for instance, this volume, pp. 367, 395, 404). Marx ceased 
contributing during the Civil War in the USA.— 3 
5 Marx has in mind Article VII of Engels' series Revolution and Counter-Revolution 
in Germany. These articles were printed in the New-York Daily Tribune over 
Marx's signature from 25 October 1851 to 23 October 1852. While writing 
them Engels constantly exchanged views with Marx who read his articles before 
sending them off to the newspaper. 
Only in 1913, when the correspondence between Marx and Engels was 
published, it became known that the articles had been written by Engels. Some 
articles of the series were published in German refugee newspapers in America. 
The German translation of the first two articles appeared in the New-Yorker 
Abendzeitung at the end of October 1851 without any reference to the source; a 
free translation of the beginning of the first article was published in Weitling's 
Republik der Arbeiter on 1 November  1851.—  3 
6 In November 1851 Cluss wrote to Marx about the need to disseminate the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue in America, noting that Magnus 
Gross,  the New York distributor, was not giving it sufficient publicity. When 
Weydemeyer went to America, he accepted Marx's proposal that he should take 
upon himself the sale and distribution of the Revue (see present edition, Vol. 
38, p. 489). On 6 February 1852 he informed Marx that he hoped to sell about 
200 copies of it at $1 instead of the $4.50 fixed by the Hamburg publisher 
Schuberth. Marx, however, was unable to have the necessary number of copies 
sent over from Europe.— 3 
7 Engels alludes to his stay at the Marxes' in London from about 20 December 
1851 to 3 January 1852 (see also this volume, p. 567).—4 
8 The reference is to the special imperial patent of 31 December 1851, which 
abolished the constitution introduced by the Austrian Government on 4 March 
1849. 
When speaking about the Prussian Constitution, Engels has in mind the one 
promulgated on 31 January 1850, which abolished all the democratic gains of 
the 1848-49 revolution and was based on high property qualification and 
unequal representation.—5 
9 Probably an allusion to Conrad Schramm who had a duel with Willich in September 
1850.—6 
10 At the beginning of 1851 Conrad Schramm, wishing to play a joke on Willich, 
sent him a letter purportedly written by Hermann Becker, a Cologne Commu­
nist League member, reflecting the views of the Willich-Schapper group. In reply 
Willich sent a number of letters to Becker expounding an adventurist plan of 
'revolutionising' the Rhine Province. Becker informed Marx of Willich's plans in 
a letter of 27 January 1851. During the Cologne trial Marx made use of these 
letters to expose the sectarian adventurist tactics of the Willich-Schapper group 
(see K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, present 
edition, Vol. 11, p. 452).—6, 569 
11 Engels describes here the reaction of the European Press to Louis Bonaparte's 
policy of unrestrained social demagogy on the one hand and increased personal 
power on the other after the coup d'état of 2 December 1851. On 1 January 
1852,  a solemn service in honour of the President for which 190,000 francs were 
assigned was held in Notre Dame de Paris; the eagles on state banners (symbol

of Napoleon's Empire) were restored. The Prince President moved to the royal 
palace of the Tuileries, where on 14 January a new Constitution was proclaimed 
under which all power was concentrated in the hands of the head of the State 
elected for a term of 10 years, the composition and legislative functions of all 
the higher state institutions were also placed under his control. A detailed 
analysis of the methods and essence of the demagogic policy pursued by 
Bonaparte in the social sphere and of repressions against the democratic and 
working-class movements is given in Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte (present edition, Vol. 11).—7 
12 This letter was published in English for the first time, slightly abridged, in Karl 
Marx and Frederick Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, International 
Publishers, New York, 1953.—7, 15, 40, 52, 79, 94, 569, 576 
13 The reference is to the first of the two satirical poems by Freiligrath written on 
Marx's request specially for Die Revolution on 16 and 23 January 1852. The poet 
ridiculed the so-called German-American loan which Kinkel tried to raise in the 
USA (see Note 27). Kinkel's activity in America was described by Cluss in his 
letters to Wilhelm Wolff of 4-6 November and to Marx in mid-December 1851. 
Freiligrath's poems were published in German in the Morgenblatt für  gebildete 
Leser, Nos. 10 and 27, 7 March and 4 July 1852, printed in Stuttgart and 
Tübingen. The first poem was also published in English in Notes to the People, 
No. 50, 10 April 1852. Both the Morgenblatt and Notes to the People carried an 
introduction, the contents of which were not identical in the two publications. 
The editors of the present edition have insufficient proof that it was Marx who 
wrote this introduction, though Freiligrath is known to have asked him to do so 
(Freiligraths Briefwechsel mit Marx und Engels, Berlin, 1968, Bd. I, S. 42-43). 
In America the first poem was published by Cluss in English in the 
newspaper The National Era, No. 282, 27 May 1852 (reproduced from the Notes 
to the People) with additions to the introduction made by Cluss, relating it to 
conditions in America. Die Revolution did not publish the poems until June 
1852.—8,  108, 119 
14 On 12 January 1852 Hirsch made a statement, but as early as February 1852 he 
was found to be a Prussian police spy and was expelled from the Communist 
League. For this reason Marx, in a letter of 20 February 1852 (see this volume, 
p. 41), asked Weydemeyer not to publish Hirsch's statement. When in the 
spring of 1853 Hirsch published his anti-Marx and Engels article 'Die Opfer 
der Moucharderie' in America, in an attempt to justify the splitting activity of 
Willich and Schapper, Cluss and Weydemeyer, in order to expose Hirsch, 
published his first statement in the Belletristisches Journal und Criminal-Zeitung, 
No. 7, 29 April 1853.—8, 41, 66 
15 The Communist League was the first German and international communist 
organisation of the proletariat formed under the leadership of Marx and 
Engels in London early in June 1847 as a result of the reorganisation of the 
League of the Just. The programme and organisational principles of the 
Communist League were drawn up with the personal participation of Marx and 
Engels. The League's members took an active part in the bourgeois-democratic 
revolutions in Europe in 1848-49. 
In 1849-50, after the defeat of the revolution, the Communist League was 
reorganised. In the summer of 1850, disagreements of principle arose in the 
League's Central Authority between its majority headed by Marx and Engels 
and the Willich-Schapper separatist group which tried to impose on the League 
its adventurist tactics of immediately unleashing a revolution without taking 

=====第629页=====
Notes 597 
into account the actual political situation and the practical possibilities in 
Germany and other European countries. After 15 September 1850 the 
Willich-Schapper group broke away from the League and formed an 
independent organisation with its own Central Authority. 
Owing to police persecutions and arrests of League members in May 1851, 
the activities of the Communist League ceased in Germany. On 17 November 
1852,  soon after the Cologne Communist Trial (see Note 16), the London 
District, on a motion by Marx, declared the League dissolved. However, many 
of its members, particularly in Germany and America, continued to be active 
for a long time.—  8, 143 
Members of the Communist League (see Note 15) were arrested by the 
Prussian police in May 1851 and accused of 'treasonable conspiracy'. The 
accused remained in detention for about eighteen months. Eleven Communist 
League members (Heinrich Bürgers, Peter Nothjung, Peter Röser, Hermann 
Heinrich Becker, Karl Otto, Wilhelm  Reiff,  Friedrich Lessner, Roland Daniels, 
Johann Jacob Klein, Johann Erhardt and Abraham Jacobi) were brought to 
trial which began in Cologne on 4 October and lasted till 12 November 1852. It 
was rigged by the Prussian police on the basis of fabricated documents and 
forged evidence which included the so-called Original Minute-book of the 
Communist League Central Authority meetings and documents stolen by the 
police from the Willich-Schapper group. The trial was accompanied by an 
anti-communist hue and cry in the official press of Germany and other 
countries. On the basis of forged documents and perjury seven of the accused 
were sentenced to imprisonment for terms of three to six years. Marx, Engels 
and their friends and associates in England, Germany and America supported 
the Cologne prisoners in the press and supplied counsel for the defence with 
documents and material exposing police fabrications. The provocative actions 
of the prosecution and the contemptible methods of the Prussian police state 
were exposed by Marx in his pamphlet Revelations Concerning the Communist 
Trial in Cologne and by Engels in the article 'The Late Trial at Cologne' (see 
present edition, Vol. 11).—9, 113, 131, 195, 351 
The reference is to Engels' series of articles on England written for Die 
Revolution. Two articles got lost on their way to the USA (see this volume, 
p. 16). Manuscripts of the last two articles have survived (see present edition, 
Vol. 11). The first of these was written by Engels on 23 January and published 
on 15 November 1852 in the Turn-Zeitung (New York) to which Weydemeyer 
contributed. The second, written on 30 January 1852, was not published during 
Engels' lifetime, but was used by Weydemeyer in a number of his own writings 
for the press.—10, 39, 80 
Engels is expressing the wish that Wilhelm Wolff should write for Die 
Revolution on current events as he did earlier in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in 
the column 'Aus dem Reich' ('From the German Empire').—10 
Between February and early April 1852, in compliance with Jones' request, 
Engels wrote for his journal Notes to the People a series of articles, the first of 
which was entitled 'Real Causes Why the French Proletarians Remained 
Comparatively Inactive in December Last' (see present edition, Vol. 11). Jones 
received it on 5 February  1852.—11,  38 
On 16 January 1852 Jones informed Engels about Harney's sudden refusal to 
write on foreign policy for The Notes  to the People.  Harney explained his position by 

=====第630页=====
598 Notes 
his friendly connections with the supporters of the parliamentary reform (see 
Note 28). The conflict between Jones and Harney arose at the end of 1850. Jones 
headed the revolutionary wing of the Chartists and worked to create a mass 
proletarian party in England, trying to unite all the revolutionary proletarian 
elements and revive Chartism on a socialist basis. Harney advocated a 'united 
national party' to be formed on the basis of diverse national associations, including 
bourgeois ones, to campaign for universal suffrage. Harney's attempts to create a 
'mass party of reform' and an independent press organ completely failed by the 
autumn of 1852.—11 
The decrees on the resignation of de Morny, Minister of the Interior, and the 
appointment of Persigny to this post, on the resignation of Fould, Minister of 
Finance, and on the confiscation of the property of the Orleans were signed by 
Louis Bonaparte on 22 January 1852 and published in Le Moniteur universel on 
23 January and Le Constitutionnel on 24 January.—12 
Pieper's article 'Die Arbeiter Assoziation in England' was written on 15 January 
1852,  but as Die Revolution had ceased to appear the article was published in 
Die Reform, Nos. 41, 42 and 44 on 20, 21 and 31 August 1853.—13 
The announcement published in the Turn-Zeitung in connection with the 
starting of Die Revolution (see Note 2), was repeated in two issues of Die 
Revolution in January 1852. It read: 'Die Revolution is published every Saturday, 
from January on, under the editorship of the undersigned and in co-operation 
with the editorial board of the former Neue Rheinische Zeitung (Marx, Engels, 
Freiligrath, etc.). Its task will be to present as clear a picture as possible of the 
class struggle which is increasingly concentrating in the Old World, to 
culminate in the abolition of all class distinctions. It will keep its readers abreast 
of all the changes occurring in the industrial and commercial relations between 
the different nations and classes of the people and in their political attitude 
towards one another, changes which prepare revolutionary explosions. 
'New York, January 1852 
'J. Weydemeyer'.—13 
When the Communist League (see Note 15) split, and Marx, Engels and their 
followers withdrew from the German Workers' Educational Society in London, 
the spokesmen of the Willich-Schapper faction (located in Great Windmill 
Street) brought a suit on behalf of the Society against Heinrich Bauer and Karl 
Pfänder, supporters of the majority of the League's Central Authority, who, as 
trustees, held part of the Society's money to be used under the Central 
Authority's control for the needs of the League and to help political refugees. 
They were accused of stealing this money. A libel campaign against Bauer and 
Pfänder was started in the press (Schweizerische National-Zeitung, 7 January 
1851;  Republik der Arbeiter, New York, Nos. 19, 20 and 21 for 23 and 30 August 
and 6 September 1851). In the statement made on 21 January 1852 and 
mentioned here, Pfänder refuted the libel and said that on 20 November 1850 
the court had acknowledged the charge to be invalid (see present edition, Vol. 
38, Note 328). 
The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 
1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the 
Just. After the reorganisation of the League of the Just in the summer of 1847 
and the founding of the Communist League, the latter's local communities

Notes 599 
played the leading role in the Society. In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx and Engels 
took an active part in the Society's work.—14, 195, 217, 226, 336 
25 This refers to the workers' society founded in London in January 1852 with 
Marx's support. It consisted of those who had withdrawn from the German 
Workers' Educational Society (see Note 24) and had the carpenter 
G. L. Stechan, a refugee from Hanover, as its chairman. An active part in 
organising this society was also played by Georg Lochner, a worker, Communist 
League member and close friend of Marx and Engels. The society did not 
survive long, many of its members, Stechan included, coming under the 
influence of the Willich-Schapper faction and rejoining their organisation.—14, 
72, 233 
26 Agitation and Emigration were the names Marx gave to two rival German 
petty-bourgeois refugee organisations in London which appeared in the 
summer of 1851—the Agitation Union headed by Ruge and Goegg and the 
German Emigration Club headed by Kinkel and Willich. The aim of both these 
small organisations was to raise money for an 'immediate revolution' 
in Germany.—14, 42, 44, 97, 15l 
27 The reference is to the so-called German-American revolutionary loan which 
Kinkel and other petty-bourgeois refugee leaders tried to raise among the 
German emigrants in Europe and America in 1851-52 to finance an 'immediate 
revolution' in Germany. Kinkel's trip to the USA for this purpose in September 
1851-March 1852 was a failure. In a number of their works (e. g. The Great 
Men of the Exile, The Knight of the Noble Consciousness, present edition, Vols. 11 
and 12), Marx and Engels ridiculed this idea of Kinkel's and denounced 
the attempts to produce a revolution artificially when the revolutionary movement 
was on the wane.—15, 73, 115, 121 
28 In January 1852 The Northern Star was sold by O'Connor to A. G. Flemming and 
D. MacGowan. In 1849 a radical political trend among the Free Traders founded 
the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association to campaign for an 
electoral reform (the so-called Little Charter) and a taxation reform. By opposing 
their programme to that of the Chartists and at the same time borrowing some of 
their demands though in an extremely curtailed form, the bourgeois radicals 
expected to split the Chartist movement and to influence the workers. The 
bourgeois radicals, supported in their campaign by Cobden, Bright and the 
reformist elements among the Chartists under O'Connor, failed and the 
Association ceased to exist in 1855. 
In writing about a Chartist faction connected with the supporters of the 
financial and parliamentary reform, Marx has Harney's group in mind (see 
Note 20).—15, 68, 89 
29 The letter to Weydemeyer and two articles of the series on England (see Note 
17) which Engels mentions have not been found.—16 
30 Engels draws an ironical parallel between the policy of Bonapartism in the 
social sphere and the views of German 'true socialists' (Karl Grün, Moses Hess, 
Hermann Kriege and others), who in the mid-1840s indulged in the 
sentimental preaching of love and brotherhood and of pseudo-socialist ideas, 
and denied the need for political struggle and a revolution. Marx and Engels 
criticised this ideological trend of the reactionary German petty bourgeoisie 
particularly in The German Ideology (see present edition, Vol. 5), and in the 
Circular Against Kriege, German Socialism in Verse and Prose and the Manifesto of 
the Communist Party (Vol. 6).—17

The Bonapartist coup d'état of 2 December 1851 caused a republican uprising 
of artisans, workers in small towns, local peasants, tradesmen and intellectuals 
in about 20 departments in South-East, South-West and Central France. 
The Bonapartists thoroughly concealed the genuine scale of the republican 
movement. The true character of the movement and its brutal suppression by 
police and troops became known only in the last years of the Second Empire 
(see present edition, Vol. 43, Marx to Engels, 19 December 1868).—17 
Engels has in mind his article 'England' which he intended to send to 
Weydemeyer with the letter (see Note 17).—18 
The Roman wall (so-called Hadrian's Wall) was erected in North England in the 
second century to defend the Roman province of Britannia against the raids of 
the Picts (tribes then inhabiting the territory of what is now Scotland) and 
extended between the Solway and the Tyne (from Carlisle to Newcastle) over a 
distance of about 120 kilometres. After the fall of Roman rule in the fifth 
century Hadrian's Wall was destroyed.—18 
These are Marx's covering notes to Stechan's contributions to Die Revolution, 
which Marx promised to Weydemeyer in his letter of 23 January 1852. The 
material contained some concrete facts concerning the persecution of the 
participants in the socialist and communist movements in Germany and the 
position of the Communist League members, Bürgers, Becker, Daniels, Otto 
and others, then under investigation in Cologne, but it was not a finished 
article. The material reached Weydemeyer in New York before 17 February but 
was not used because Die Revolution had ceased to appear.—19 
On the confiscation of the property of the Orleans, the appointment of 
Persigny Minister of the Interior, and the resignation of Minister of Finance 
Fould, see Note 21.—21 
The 'glorious revolution' of 1688 in England established a constitutional 
monarchy based on a compromise between the landed aristocracy and the 
financial bourgeoisie.— 21 
Kossuth was given an enthusiastic reception on his arrival in England in 
October 1851. Some bourgeois liberals and government representatives, in 
particular the Foreign Secretary Palmerston, used this welcome as an excuse to 
eulogise British constitutional freedoms. This served as a hypocritical cover for 
the unseemly role played by Britain in supporting the suppression of European 
revolutions, including that in Hungary. 
The Great Exhibition in London, held from 1 May to 15 October 1851, was 
the first world trade and industrial exhibition, and was portrayed by some as 
the beginning of an era of 'universal peace'.—21 
The reference is to the verse added by Freiligrath to the second poem which he 
had written for Weydemeyer's newspaper on 23 January 1852 (see Note 13) 
and sent to Marx on 25 January 1852 to have his opinion: 
Das heißt: dafern Du Babel nicht beglücktest 
Endlos mit Briefen, Karten, Inseraten, 
(Plakaten gar!) —dafern Du Dich nicht bücktest, 
Und um ein Wörtlein nur von Deinen Thaten 
Feig vor der Presse krochst und so Dich drücktest, 
(Gleich Virtuosen oder Akrobaten,) 
Daß Dich zuletzt, nach manchem sauern Schritt, 
Wirklich in Holz die Illustrierte schnitt! 

=====第633页=====
Notes 601 
Here Freiligrath alludes to the fact that Kinkel, by flattery and fawning, 
succeeded in having an article about  himself,  together with a portrait, printed in 
the Illustrated News on 30 November 1850. 
When the poem was published, the additional verse about Kinkel was not 
included, which means that Freiligrath complied with Marx's recommenda­
tion.—21 
39 Freiligrath's second poem contained verses addressed to Hans Andersen which 
Marx mentions here. They were prompted by Freiligrath's grudge against 
Andersen who, while in London, did not recognise him when they chanced to 
meet. He felt all the more bitter because the Danish storyteller had enjoyed his 
hospitality in Germany. 
When the poem was published in Die Revolution the editors supplied the 
following note to Andersen's name: 'Herr Andersen himself appears here not 
merely as an individual but as the epitome of a peculiar type of literary lion 
and parasite to which the revolution seemed to have dealt the death-blow but 
which is again coming up and boastfully asserting itself everywhere.' In 
Freüigraths gesammelte Dichtungen published in Stuttgart in 1870 (Bd. 4, S. 5-6) 
the poem was printed without the 11 verses devoted to Hans Christian 
Andersen.—22 
40 In a letter to Marx of 25 January 1852 Freiligrath quoted a letter from Ebner 
who expressed surprise at not having received any letters from Marx and 
Pieper and promised to discuss with the publisher Löwenthal the possibility of 
printing Marx's works. It later transpired that Ebner was an Austrian police 
informer, of which Marx and his friends were not aware at the time.— 22 
41 Marx refers here to the ruling of the Board of indicting magistrates concerning 
the members of the Communist League arrested and detained under 
investigation in Cologne (see Note 16). He quotes it probably from the letter of 
the lawyer Bermbach received in January 1852 (it has not been found). This 
same letter was also used by Marx when he described the proceedings to 
Weydemeyer in a letter of 13 February 1852 (see this volume, p.  34).—  22 
42 The letters of Marx and Engels to The Times and The Daily News on the 
Cologne Communist Trial were not published in view of the editors' hostility to 
the leading figures of the revolutionary movement. The original of Engels' 
letter to The Daily News has not survived. It may be that Engels did not do the 
final editing (see this volume, p. 29). For Marx's and Engels' letter to The Times 
see Vol. 11 of the present edition.—24, 25 
43 The New-York Daily Tribune published in all 19 articles of Engels' Revolution 
and Counter-Revolution in Germany. Marx intended to write the last, twentieth, 
article, but did not do so.—25 
44 Eccarius wrote an article about the English machine-building workers' strike 
(see Note 79) for Die Revolution, but since the latter had ceased publication 
Weydemeyer proposed to publish the article in the New-Yorker Demokrat. — 26, 
117 
45 Marx refers here to his work on political economy which he started as early as 
1843.  He conceived it as a critique of bourgeois political economy and an 
analysis of the economic structure of bourgeois society in his time and its 
ideological basis. His initial research resulted in the writing of Economic and 
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 (see present edition, Vol. 3) which were to serve 
as a basis for the whole work. On 1 February 1845, Marx signed a contract with 

=====第634页=====
602 Notes 
Carl Leske, a Darmstadt publisher, for the publication of his two-volume 'Kritik 
der Politik und National-Ökonomie'. This plan did not materialise as a whole, 
however, because Marx was busy writing other works (The Holy Family, The 
German Ideology, etc.). The contract with Leske was cancelled in February 1847. 
Marx returned to his economic studies when he was in London, in the 
period of emigration, after the defeat of the 1848-49 bourgeois-democratic 
revolutions. From the spring of 1850 onwards he regularly visited the library of 
the British Museum, where he made a deep and thorough study of the 
economy of different countries, England in particular, critically analysed works 
by classic bourgeois economists, and made extracts from books by English, 
French, American and other economists and from official documents and 
periodicals. The notes and extracts made by Marx in the 1850s fill several 
dozen special notebooks. At that period Marx was especially interested in the 
history of landed property and rent, the history and theory of money 
circulation and prices, and economic crises. 
In 1851 and 1852 Marx renewed his attempts to find a publisher for his 
work on economics, but he could not find one either in Germany or in 
America. 
The vast stock of facts and theoretical material on political economy 
accumulated between 1850 and 1853 was systematised and arranged in the 
manuscripts of 1857-58 (also known as the Grundrisse), part of which, after a 
further revision, was published in 1859 as the first part of A Contribution to the 
Critique of Political Economy. Work on the economic manuscripts of the 1850s 
was an important stage in Marx's writing his main economic treatise, Capital, 
published in 1867.—26, 46, 69, 99, 259, 293, 367 
Here Engels has in mind the Willich-Schapper faction (see Note 15) which 
existed till early 1853.—29 
The publication of Harney's weekly, The Friend of the People, the first issue of 
which appeared on 14 December 1850, was discontinued at the end of July 
1851. 
Harney seems to have sent to Marx the proofs of the first issue of the 
resumed publication, which came out on 7 February 1852.—30 
The Amalgamated Society of Engineers was founded in 1851. Gerald Massey's 
article, mentioned by Marx, was published in The Friend of the  People,  No. 1, on 
7 February 1852 and entitled 'The Engineers, Operative and Co-operative'.— 
30 
The reference is to Harney's speech at the Chartist meeting in London on 3 
February 1852, the opening day of the English Parliament.— 31 
Marx may have had in mind O'Connor's speech in the Court of Chancery (2-5 
February 1852) where he and the directors of the Chartist National Land 
Company founded in 1845 gave evidence on the Company's financial activity, 
and its compliance with the parliamentary Act of August 1851 which envisaged 
the disbanding of this Chartist organisation. O'Connor's evidence was published 
in The Northern Star, No. 744, 7 February 1852.—31 
The Egyptian Pasha Mohammed Ali, who had actually secured his position as 
independent ruler of the country and strove to secede from the Ottoman 
Empire, carried out a number of important socio-economic reforms in the 
1820s-30s in the sphere of agrarian relations, organisation of the state 
apparatus, industry and the navy. In his reforms Mohammed Ali received a

certain assistance from French ruling circles who supported him in the struggle 
against the Sultan in order to strengthen their own position in the Middle East. 
On Mohammed Ali's invitation a large number of French officers, military 
instructors and engineers went to Egypt.—31 
52 This letter (without Jenny Marx's postscript) was published in English for the 
first time in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, 
International Publishers, New York, 1953 and the journal Masses and 
Mainstream, New York, 1953, No. 3. 
An extract from Jenny Marx's postscript was first published in Die Neue 
Zeit, Bd. 2, Nr. 29, Stuttgart, 1906-07.—33 
53 Marx wanted someone to start a campaign in the American Press in defence of 
the accused in the Cologne Communist Trial (see Note 16). This letter was used 
by Cluss as a basis for a large article published in Cincinnati in the democratic 
newspaper, Der Hochwächter, No. 80, 14 April 1852. On Marx's request, 
Weydemeyer also delivered the material about those accused in Cologne to the 
New-York Daily Tribune, which published it considerably abridged and with 
some editorial remarks as a leading article 'Justice in Prussia' in No. 3446, 4 
May 1852.—34 
54 An allusion to the fact that Kinkel, a participant in the 1849 Baden-Palatinate 
uprising, was taken prisoner and sentenced to life imprisonment. In November 
1850,  with the help of Carl Schurz, he escaped from the prison in Spandau to 
England.— 34 
55 In a letter of 6 February 1852 (with a postscript from Cluss) Weydemeyer 
informed Marx of the suspension of Die Revolution (see Note 2) and Cluss' and 
his intention to continue publication of Marx's works written in London, as 
announced in the first issue of the journal. Weydemeyer also wrote that on 4 
February 1852 Dana published in the New-York Daily Tribune an article by 
Ludwig Simon (a deputy to the Frankfurt National Assembly), 'Movements of 
the German Political Exiles', attacking Marx and Engels.-^37, 44 
56 The reference is to the former deputies of the Frankfurt National Assembly. 
The Frankfurt Left—the petty-bourgeois Left wing of the National Assembly 
which was convened after the March revolution in Germany and opened its 
session in Frankfurt on 18 May 1848. The main aim of the Assembly was to put 
an end to the political disunity of Germany and draw up an all-German 
Constitution. However it failed to take a decisive stand on the basic problems of 
the 1848-49 German revolution and ceased to exist on 18 June  1849.—  37 
67 March associations (thus named after the March 1848 revolution) were branches 
in various German towns of the Central March Association, founded in 
Frankfurt am Main at the end of November 1848 by Left-wing deputies to the 
Frankfurt National Assembly. Fröbel, Simon, Rüge, Vogt and other petty-
bourgeois democratic leaders of the associations confined themselves to 
revolutionary phrase-mongering and displayed indecision and inconsistency in 
the struggle against counter-revolution, for which Marx and Engels criticised 
them sharply in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (see K. Marx, 'The Frankfurt 
March Association and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung', present edition, 
Vol. 9).—37, 42, 44 
58 In writing about the King of Prussia being imposed on the German people 
Marx had in mind the all-German central government headed by a hereditary 
emperor and the Imperial Parliament—the Reichstag, which were envisaged by

the Imperial Constitution drawn up by the Frankfurt Assembly. On 28 March 
1849 the Assembly offered the imperial crown to Frederick William IV of 
Prussia but he refused to accept it from the 'people's representation'.—42, 44 
Karl Vogt was a member of the Imperial Regency of five formed in Stuttgart on 
7 June 1849 by the rump of the National Assembly which moved there from 
Frankfurt. The attempts of the Regency to implement by parliamentary means 
the Imperial Constitution, drawn up by the Frankfurt Assembly and rejected by 
the German princes, failed.—42, 44 
Cluss made a statement about the congress of American guarantors of the 
'German-American loan' (see Note 27) to be held in Cincinnati on 3-8 February 
1852.  Cluss protested against being named as one of the guarantors. On Marx's 
instructions he exposed the adventurism of the whole idea. Cluss dispatched the 
text of the statement to Marx in London at the end of February 1852 and had 
it published in the Turn-Zeitung, No. 6, 1 March 1852.—42, 70, 92 
Straubinger —German travelling journeyman. Marx and Engels ironically 
applied the name to some participants in the German working-class movement 
of the time who were connected with guild production and displayed 
petty-bourgeois sectarian tendencies.—43, 137, 410 
On 16 February 1852, amidst alarming rumours of Louis Bonaparte's intention 
to invade the British Isles, Russell moved in Parliament a Local Militia Bill for 
England and Wales. The government was granted the right, in the event of an 
enemy attack, to increase the strength of militia detachments previously used 
only within their respective counties and to subordinate them to the regular 
army command. When the Bill was discussed in the House of Commons, 
Palmerston moved an amendment that it should apply also to Scotland and 
Ireland, and that the word 'Local' be deleted. Palmerston had recendy resigned 
from the Cabinet (see Note 74) and the adoption of the amendment moved by 
him was considered by Russell as an expression of non-confidence in the 
government and served as a pretext for Russell's resignation on 20 February 
1852.  The Tory Cabinet headed by Derby was formed on 23 February 1852. 
The Bill became law in July 1852.—44, 49, 284, 520 
This name was given in England to Free Traders who advocated government 
non-interference in economic life. In the 1840s and 1850s the Manchester men 
formed a separate political group which joined the Liberal Party as its Left 
wing in the 1860s. The centre of Free Traders' agitation headed by two textile 
manufacturers, Richard Cobden and John Bright, was Manchester.—44, 69, 
355 
'Voting by ballot to prevent bribery and intimidation by the bourgeoisie' was the 
fourth point of the People's Charter published in 1838 as the programme of 
the General Working Men's Association in London (see F. Engels, The Condition 
of the Working-Class in England, present edition, Vol. 4, p. 518).—45 
Marx's letters to Lassalle mentioned here have not been found.—46 
Engels replies to a letter of 9 February 1852 in which Weydemeyer 
acknowledged receipt of Engels' first letter dated 23 January (see this volume, 
pp. 15-19); Engels' earlier letters had not reached Weydemeyer.—52 
Engels has in mind his article 'England. I' written for Die Revolution. About the 
whole series see Note 17.—52

68 Engels recalls the time when he fought in the ranks of the revolutionary 
detachments of the Palatinate provisional government (its seat was in 
Kaiserslautern) against the Prussian troops during the campaign for the 
Imperial Constitution (see Note 77). Engels was an aide-de-camp of August 
Willich who commanded a workers' corps. This corps was covering the retreat 
of the Baden-Palatinate insurgent troops to Switzerland and was the last to 
cross the border on 12 July 1849.— 52 
R9 The reference is to the counter-revolutionary coalition of European powers  — 
the resurrected Holy Alliance as Engels calls it—formed during the suppres­
sion of the 1848-49 revolutions. See Marx's and Engels' article 'The New "Holy 
Alliance" (present edition, Vol. 8) and Engels' 'Conditions and Prospects of a 
War of the Holy Alliance against France in 1852' (Vol.  10).—  53 
7(1 British troops under Wellington fought Napoleonic France during the 
Peninsular War, 1808-14.—53 
71 Engels characterised this Bill in his article 'England. II' (see present edition, 
Vol. 11).—53 
72 The Anti-Corn Law League was founded in 1838 by the manufacturers Cobden 
and Bright. In the interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, the League strove to 
repeal the Corn Laws which were introduced in England in the fifteenth 
century and limited or banned corn imports for the benefit of the landed 
aristocracy. The League's aim was to reduce corn prices on the home market 
and together with them workers' wages. It made wide use of the free trade 
slogan, demagogically preaching that the interests of workers and industrialists 
coincided. In 1846 the Corn Laws were repealed, which signified victory for the 
industrial bourgeoisie, advocates of free trade (see Note 63). That same year 
the League declared itself dissolved, but in fact its branches continued to 
exist. In February 1852, in view of the protectionist tendencies of the Derby-
Ministry, attempts were made to revive the League.—  53, 56, 61, 69, 512 
73 The Peelites—a group of moderate Tories who rallied around Sir Robert Peel 
in the 1840s and supported his policy of concessions to the commercial and 
industrial bourgeoisie in the economic sphere while preserving the political 
domination of the big landlords and financiers. In 1846, in the interests of the 
industrial bourgeoisie, Peel repealed the Corn Laws. This caused great 
dissatisfaction among the Tory protectionists and led to a split in the Tory 
party and the secession of the Peelites. After Peel's death (1850), the Peelites 
formed a political group without any definite programme; they participated in 
the Aberdeen Coalition Ministry (1852-55) and merged with the Liberal Party 
in the late 1850s and early 1860s.—54, 129 
74 Palmerston, Foreign Secretary in the Whig Ministry of Russell, was dismissed 
because in a conversation with the French ambassador in London he had 
expressed his approval of the Bonapartist coup d'état of 2 December 1851, 
without consulting other members of the Ministry. The dismissal occurred on 
19 December 1851, though in principle the British Government did not 
disagree with Palmerston's point of view and was the first in Europe to 
recognise the Bonapartist regime in France.—  54, 456 
75 Aliens Bills were occasionally passed by the British Parliament on the pretext of 
guarding British subjects against the allegedly hostile actions of foreigners 
residing in England. These Bills were in fact directed against members of the

international revolutionary-democratic and working-class movement who lived 
in England as political refugees.—54, 523 
76 Engels did not write a special article on this subject for Weydemeyer, but 
expressed some of his ideas on matters of the cotton industry and the 
development of world trade in letters to Marx (in particular, on 2 March and 
20 April 1852, see this volume, pp. 57-58 and 82-83), who in his turn shared 
them with his American friends. These ideas were reflected in articles by Cluss 
and Weydemeyer published in 1852 in American democratic periodicals, e.g. 
Weydemeyer's 'Die Lage Europa's' in the Turn-Zeitung, No. 10, 1 July 
1852.—55 
77 The campaign for the Imperial Constitution, which was adopted by the Frankfurt 
National Assembly (see Note 56) on 28 March 1849, was the last stage of the 
1848-49 bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany. Despite its limited 
character, the Constitution was a step forward in solving the problem of 
Germany's unification. But it was rejected by the majority of German 
governments. In May 1849 popular uprisings in support of the Constitution 
broke out in Saxony, Rhenish Prussia, Baden and the Palatinate. The 
insurgents received no support from the Frankfurt National Assembly and the 
movement was suppressed in July 1849. Engels devoted his work The Campaign 
for the German Imperial Constitution to this subject (see present edition, Vol. 
10), but did not fulfil his wish to elucidate this problem in one of the articles of 
Revolution and Counter-Revolution in  Germany.—  56 
78 In 1844, to satisfy the Austrian Government, Sir James Graham, the British 
Home Secretary, ordered that the letters of Italian revolutionary refugees 
should be handed over to the police to be opened. This was the case with the 
letters of the Bandiera brothers (members of the conspiratorial organisation) to 
Mazzini containing the plan of their expedition to Calabria. The aim of the 
expedition was to start an uprising in Italy against the Neapolitan Bourbons 
and Austrian rule. The participants in the .expedition were arrested and the 
Bandieras executed.— 56 
79 The machine-building workers' strike which started in late December 1851 in 
several towns of South-East and Central England was organised by the 
Amalgamated Society of Engineers (see Note 48) with the aim of abolishing 
overtime and improving working conditions. The employers responded with a 
lock-out on a national scale. After three months' struggle the workers were 
defeated and compelled to resume work on the former terms.— 57 
80 The anonymous letter of 29 February 1852 informed Marx that he and his 
friends were under Prussian police surveillance and hinted that there might be 
a traitor in their organisation.—58 
81 Marx's letter to Amalie Daniels has not been found; judging by Marx's letter to 
Freiligrath (see this volume, p. 23), it could have been written after 26 January 
1852.—59 
82 Jones' letter to Weydemeyer of 3 March 1852 was intended for Die Revolution. 
It described the condition of various classes of English society and analysed the 
development of class struggle in England. Judging by Weydemeyer's letter to 
Marx of 24 May 1853, the letter was published in the American democratic 
papers at the end of 1852 or beginning of 1853.—59, 60, 70, 319

85 Apparently, while writing the concluding part of The Eighteenth Brumaire of 
Louis Bonaparte, Marx somewhat changed his plan: the work includes not six, 
but seven chapters, the last of which he sent to New York on 25 March 1852 
(see this volume, p. 70).—60, 573 
86 The role of protectionism at the different stages of capitalist development and 
the influence of the Corn Laws on the economic structure and class relations in 
capitalist society were the subject of a special economic research by Marx. See 
in particular 'The Protectionists, the Free Traders and the Working Class', 
'Speech on the Question of Free Trade', Marx's speech included into Engels' 
'The Free Trade Congress at Brussels' (present edition, Vol. 6) and also Capital, 
Vol. Ill, Book III, Part VI, Chapters XXXVII and XLIIL—61

8S In 1853 these notes were used by Cluss almost unchanged in the article 'Das

written against Heinzen and other petty-bourgeois democrats (see present 
edition, Vol. 12).—65 
89 In their polemic articles against Heinzen published in the Deutsche-Brüsseler-
Zeitung in 1847 (Engels' 'The Communists and Karl Heinzen' and Marx's. 
'Moralising Criticism and Critical Morality', see present edition, Vol. 6) Marx 
and Engels revealed the narrow-minded democratism of the German petty-
bourgeois radicals, in particular their failure to understand the need for the 
centralisation and unification of Germany.—65

94 Engels began to study Slavonic languages (Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian 
and Czech) at the end of 1850 and wanted to write a comparative grammar of 
these languages. He studied Russian most thoroughly. Extracts made by Engels 
from Pushkin's Eugene Onegin and The Bronze Horseman and Griboyedov's Wit 
Works Woe have survived. In the early 1850s he made extracts from Bowring's 
Specimens of the Russian Poets on eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century poets

and writers: Lomonosov, Derzhavin, Karamzin, Zhukovsky, Krylov and others. 
He knew many works by Czech and Serbian authors on the history of literature 
and folk art and also studied the history and culture of the Slav peoples on the 
basis of books by West European authorities.— 67 
15 Engels alludes to the portraits of George Washington, John Milton, Robert 
Blum and others printed in Harney's The Friend of the People. The portrait of 
Kosciuszko (1746-1817), a leader in the Polish liberation movement, was 
printed in No. 6, 13 March 1852.—68 
16 On 14 March 1852 Louis Bonaparte decreed the conversion of the state five 
per cents. The holders of five per cent papers were offered reimbursement of 
their nominal value or their exchange for papers of the same nominal price but 
bringing in 4 V2 per cent revenue. The measure was carried out with the help 
of the banking houses. The decree was published in Le Moniteur universel, No. 
74, 14 March 1852.—68 
' Marx has in mind the plan suggested by Weydemeyer (in his letter to Marx of 
10 March 1852), after the weekly Die Revolution ceased to appear, to publish 
the manuscripts held by Weydemeyer as separate pamphlets. The first issue was 
to contain Freiligrath's poems; the second, Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte; the third, Eccarius' article on the English machine-building workers' 
strike; the fourth, Cluss' article on the campaign for abstention from strong 
drinks; the fifth, his own article against Kinkel's memorandum; the sixth, Engels' 
article on England, and so on. However, Weydemeyer managed to issue two 
pamphlets only (see Note  2).—  70 
18 Weydemeyer fulfilled Marx's instructions (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 163). 
Marx relates, not quite accurately, the story told by the Greek writer Athenaeus 
(2nd-3rd cent. A.D.) in his book Deipnosophistai (Dinner-Table Philosophers). 
The Egyptian Pharaoh Tachos, alluding to the small stature of the Spartan 
King Agesilaus, who had come with his troops to the Pharaoh's help, said: 'The 
mountain was in labour. Zeus was afraid. But the mountain has brought forth a 
mouse.' Agesilaus replied: 'I seem to you now only a mouse, but the time will 
come when I will appear to you like a lion.'—70 
19 On 23 March 1852, on Marx's instructions, Wilhelm Wolff wrote in a letter to 
Cluss (to be passed on to Weydemeyer) that, instead of an article against 
Kossuth, Szemere was going to publish a pamphlet of 10 sheets about Görgey, 
Batthyâny and Kossuth. Attempts to find a publisher in the USA in 1852 failed 
however, and only in 1853 did the newspaper Die Reform (Nos. 18-28, 1 June-6 
July) publish the second section of the article, devoted to Görgey. The book 
appeared in Hamburg in  1853.—  70, 77 
,0 Marx refers here to the German Workers' Educational Society (see Note 24) 
dominated at the time by supporters of Willich and Schapper. 
On Pfänder's statement, see Note 24.— 72 
n The reference is to preparations to start The People's  Paper.—  72 
'2 In February 1852 the Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer published 
Szemere's letter against Kossuth. Cluss informed Marx and Wolff of this in a 
letter at the end of February 1852.—73 
13 Marx means the Central Committee of European Democracy founded in London in 
June 1850 on Mazzini's initiative. It included Ledru-Rollin, Darasz and Ruge 
and united bourgeois and petty-bourgeois refugees from different countries. In 
March 1852 the Central Committee of European Democracy actually dissolved

The capture of Rome was effected by French troops on 1 July 1849 as a 
result of the intervention of France, Austria, Spain and Naples against the 
Roman Republic proclaimed on 9 February 1849. After this event the republic 
ceased to exist.—73 
15 Marx refers here to Cluss' letter of 18 March 1852. Cluss reported on the 
activities of German petty-bourgeois emigrants in the USA and his opposition 
to the Congress of Kinkel's guarantors in Pittsburgh. This statement, dated 18 
February, was published in the Baltimore Wecker and reprinted in the 
Demokratisches Tageblatt (Cincinnati), No. 145, 20 March 1852, under the title 
'Eine verdeckte Batterie'. — 76 
16 The reference here is to Weydemeyer's letter to Marx and Engels of 6 April 
1852.  The part addressed to Engels bore no date, thus giving rise to Engels' 
doubts. 
Engels has in mind here a meeting of the German petty-bourgeois refugees 
convened in New York on 3 April 1852 by the representatives of the American 
Revolutionary League (see Note 173) and presided by Fickler. Goegg and 
Fickler, who vied with Kinkel in raising funds in the USA for the so-called 
German-American revolutionary loan (see Note 27), tried to make Kinkel's 
supporters agree to the association of the rival emigrant organisations. This was 
also reported in Cluss' letter to Wolff of 4-6 April 1852.—79 
" Judging by Weydemeyer's letter to Marx of 11 May 1852 Müller-Tellering's

0 Bas-empire (Lower Empire)—the name sometimes given in historical literature 
to the Byzantine Empire and also to the late Roman Empire; it came to denote 
a state at the stage of decline and dissolution. Here it refers to the 
proclamation of the Second Empire in France then being prepared by 
Bonapartist circles and effected on 2 December 1852.—  82, 453 
1 Only an extract from this letter has survived, quoted by Cluss in his letter to 
Weydemeyer of 6 June 1852. Marx made use of the economic data contained 
in Engels' letter to him of 20 April 1852 (see this volume, pp. 81-83) 
supplementing his political conclusion: 'On the other hand, it explains the 
flaccid condition of politics in this country. Given such prosperity, the Tories 
cannot, for their part, compete with the "blessings of Free Trade", even 
though they are at the helm, while the Free Traders, for their part, refrain 
from provoking political agitation because, so long as business is flourishing, 
the manufacturers do not want political upheavals and disturbances.'—83

Weydemeyer of 8 May 1852.—84 
3 The Society of 10 December—a secret Bonapartist organisation founded in 1849 
and consisting mainly of declassed elements, political adventurists and 
reactionary military. Its members were active participants in and organisers of

4 The reference here is presumably to the five chapters from Marx's The 
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte dispatched by Marx to Weydemeyer in 
New York between January and March 1852 and, after the manuscript had 
been copied, returned enclosed in Weydemeyer's letter of 6 April  1852.—  88 
3 A reference to the division at the second reading of the Militia Bill (see Note 
62) in the House of Commons.—89 
6 In the spring of 1852 negotiations were carried on to set up a new editorial 
board of The Northern Star, a Chartist newspaper published by O'Connor from 
1837 onwards. Harney turned down Jones' proposal to publish the Chartist 
newspaper jointly, would not let Jones buy The Northern Star, acquired it 
himself and continued the publication first under the title The Star and from 
24 April 1852 The Star of  Freedom.  This revealed the disagreement in principle 
existing between Jones and Harney, the latter seeking to turn the newspaper 
into the mouthpiece of the Right-wing Chartists and bourgeois radicals. In May 
1852,  Jones started a new Chartist weekly, The People's Paper.—89, 93 
7 Engels wrote this letter on Weydemeyer's letter to him of 12 April 1852.— 90 
8 In April 1852 Engels wrote only Article XIV; the next articles (XV-XIX), 
devoted to the campaign for the Imperial Constitution and the popular 
uprisings of 1849 in its support, were written in July-September 1852.— 90 
9 Engels visited Marx in London in the first half of April 1852 and returned to 
Manchester about 13 April.— 92 
i0 Gymnastic clubs—organisations of German democratic emigrants, including 
workers, set up in the USA by former participants in the 1848-49 revolution. 
At a congress in Philadelphia on 5 October 1850 the gymnastic clubs united 
into a Socialist Gymnastic Association (Sozialistischer Turnverein) which main­
tained contacts with German workers' organisations in America and published 
the Turn-Zeitung, a newspaper to which Weydemeyer and Cluss contributed 
regularly in 1852 and 1853.—92, 282 
11 Marx quotes Cluss' letter to him of 15 April 1852. Cluss' previous letter of 4-6 
April, mentioned here, was addressed to Wilhelm Wolff and informed him of a 
meeting of the German petty-bourgeois refugees held in New York on 3 April 
1852 (see Note 106).—93 
!2 The reference is presumably to the copies of Marx's letters of 15-22 August 
and 2 December 1851 to the journalist Ebner, in which he exposed the 
activities of Rüge, Kinkel, Willich and others (see present edition, Vol. 38). 
Later these literary sketches became part of the pamphlet The Great Men of the 
Exile (see Note 131). Marx's letters to Ebner became known to the Austrian 
police.— 93

1852,  immediately after the death of Marx's youngest daughter Franziska, in 
reply to Weydemeyer's letter describing the difficulties encountered in 
publishing The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.—94 
126 Weydemeyer wanted to publish Pfänder's statements (see Note 24, and this 
volume, p. 14) in one of the issues of the planned non-periodic journal Die 
Revolution; this intention was not carried out.—94

I2S The International Industrial Exhibition in New York was held in July 
1853.—95,  120, 349 
129 Weydemeyer complied with Marx's request and reported this in the article 'Die 
Lage Europa's' published in the Turn-Zeitung, No. 10, 1 July 1852.—96 
130 Marx presumably wrote to Cluss about the conflict between Jones and Harney 
(see Note 116) on 30 April 1852. This letter has not been found. Cluss 
mentioned it in his letter to Marx of 22-24 May 1852.—96 
131 It was in early 1851 that Marx and Engels conceived the idea of publishing a 
satirical exposé of the leaders of the petty-bourgeois democratic emigration. 
Engels wanted to publish a series of articles about 'continental democracy' in 
the weekly Friend of the People (see present edition, Vol. 38, p. 278) and in the 
autumn of 1851 he began writing a satirical article about Karl Schapper. As is 
seen from Marx's letters to Ebner (see Note 122), he had the literary portraits 
of Rüge, Kinkel, Willich and others ready as early as 1851. In late April and 
early May 1852 he continued collecting facts and material on this subject and 
received great help in this from Cluss and Weydemeyer, who sent him 
newspaper cuttings describing activities of various emigrant organisations in 
America. 
On the basis of the facts collected Marx and Engels drew up a political 
pamphlet during May and June 1852. It was tentatively entitled The Great Men 
and was to consist of two parts. Only the manuscript of the first part has 
survived. The pamphlet was not published during the authors' lifetime, but 
separate chapters became known to the émigré leaders, its 'heroes' (see this 
volume, p. 124). Some excerpts were sent to Cluss in America in May 1852. 
A proposal to publish the manuscript was made by a Hungarian emigre, 
Bangya, who, as it turned out later, had been a police spy since 1851 and kept 
Greif,  a Prussian police agent in London, fully informed about Marx. Marx 
learned about Bangya's actions only at the end of 1852 and publicly exposed 
them in the article 'Hirsch's Confessions' (see present edition, Vol. 12). 
The manuscript copy that has survived was written mainly by Engels with 
additions by Marx. The first pages are in Dronke's hand. The pamphlet is 
published in Vol. 11 of the present edition.—98 
132 After Kinkel's return from the USA, the committee which was to organise the 
'German-American revolutionary loan' decided at its sitting in London on 16 
April 1852 to reactivate the local sections. With this aim in view it distributed 
an instruction circular drawn up by Kinkel and Willich. Marx writes here about 
a copy of it made and sent to him by Bangya. On Bangya's spying activities, see 
Note 131.—100 
133 An allusion to the fact that in 1844-45 Mazzini protested in the press against 
Italian revolutionary emigrants' letters being opened by the police. His 
pamphlet, 'Italy, Austria and the Pope. A letter to Sir James Graham', was 
published in May 1845 in periodicals and separately. At that time James

Graham was Home Secretary and it was on his orders that Italian revolutionary 
emigrants' letters were delivered to the police.—101 
On 14 April 1849, the Hungarian National Assembly, on Kossuth's initiative, 
proclaimed the independence of Hungary and the overthrow of the Habsburg 
dynasty. On 2 May the Defence Council was replaced by a Council of Ministers 
headed by Szemere. Kossuth was elected ruler of Hungary. The siege of Ofen 
(Buda) by the Hungarian army under Görgey lasted from 4 to 21 May 1849 
and ended in the taking of the fortress. The storm was effected after the defeat 
of the Austrian troops near Komarom on 22 April 1849, which provided 
favourable conditions for the Hungarian revolutionary army to march on 
Vienna. See Engels' appraisal of the military operations during the siege of 
Buda in his article 'Buda', present edition, Vol. 17.—101 
The battle of Idstedt (a village in northern Schleswig) was fought on 24-25 July 
1850 by the Schleswig-Holsteinian and Danish troops and was the concluding 
episode of the national liberation uprising in Schleswig-Holstein against Danish 
rule in 1848-50. Under public pressure the Prussian Government, together with 
other states of the German Confederation, started a war against Denmark in 
1848,  but repeatedly betrayed the insurgents and on 2 July 1850 concluded 
peace with Denmark, leaving the insurgents to fight alone. As a result, the 
duchies remained within the Kingdom of Denmark. See Engels' detailed 
analysis of this battle on pp. 451-52 of this volume.—103 
As from 1852 Engels made a thorough study of the history of warfare, 
planning to write a military history of the 1848-49 revolutions, the Hungarian 
and Italian campaigns in particular. For this purpose he studied the works by 
Clausewitz, Jomini, Willisen, Hoffstetter, Küntzel, Görgey and many others. 
However, he failed to implement his plan.—104, 128, 249 
These are extracts from two letters which Marx sent to Cluss in the USA on 7 
May and on about 15 May 1852. The extracts were quoted by Cluss in his letter 
to Weydemeyer of 31 May 1852. It cannot be established with certainty when 
each extract was written. However, the analysis of the letters from Cluss to 
Marx of 22-24 May 1852 and to Weydemeyer of 25 May 1852 leads to the 
conclusion that the first paragraphs belong to the second letter and the rest 
must be from that of 7 May, though passages from the second letter are 
interpolated; this applies in particular to the passage containing quotations 
from Bermbach's letter of 3 May 1852, which could not have been received in 
London earlier than 13 May.—105 
After his expulsion from the German Workers' Educational Society in London 
in the spring of 1850, Müller-Tellering (on the exposure of his intrigues in that 
Society, see present edition, Vol. 38, pp. 229-30) wrote a lampoon— 
Vorgeschmack in die künftige deutsche Diktatur von Marx und Engels. The 
inscription on the envelope quoted here by Marx is a direct allusion to that 
publication. In compliance with Marx's wish Cluss returned to Müller-Tellering 
everything he had received.—105 
Demagogues is Germany were the participants in the students' opposition 
movement after the liberation of the country from Napoleonic rule. The name

the demagogues.—106, 223

HO -phg reference is to György Klapka's 'Political Programme' dated April 1852. 
Marx wrote the introductory and concluding remarks to it (see present edition, 
Vol. 11) planning to publish them in the New-York Daily Tribune. But the plan 
was not realised in this form. In September-November 1852 Marx had the 
articles 'Movements of Mazzini and Kossuth.—League with Louis Napoleon.— 
Palmerston' and 'Kossuth, Mazzini, and Louis Napoleon' (see present edition, 
Vol. 11) published in that newspaper. He warned revolutionary democrats 
against premature action and maintained that any reliance on support from 
Louis Bonaparte in the struggle to liberate Hungary and Italy from Austrian 
rule would only contribute to strengthening the Second Empire.—106 
141 In a letter to Marx of 6 February 1852 Weydemeyer promised to dispatch the 
first 50 copies of The Eighteenth Brumaire published as a special issue of the 
journal Die Revolution. Since the printing was delayed they were dispatched 
through Korff much later, but Marx did not receive them. For lack of money 
Weydemeyer failed to buy up all the copies printed and sent only 10 copies on 
13 August 1852, which reached London in early September. At the end of 
October 1852 Marx received 130 copies more from Cluss.—106 
142 See notes 17 and 44.—107 
143 In September 1851 arrests were made in France among members of local 
communities who belonged to the Willich-Schapper group (see Note 15). The 
conspiratorial tactics of this group enabled the French and Prussian police, with 
the help of the agent-provocateur Cherval, who headed one of the Paris 
communities and at the same time was in the pay of the Prussian and French 
police, to fabricate the case of the so-called Franco-German plot. In February 1852 
the accused were sentenced on a charge of plotting a coup d'état. Cherval was 
allowed to escape from prison. Attempts of the Prussian police to 
incriminate the Communist League led by Marx and Engels failed. Marx 
publicly exposed these provocations in his Revelations Concerning the Communist 
Trial in Cologne and Herr Vogt (see present edition, vols. 11 and 17).—112,

volunteers' corps during the 1849 Baden-Palatinate uprising) to form a special 
military unit in the USA in view of an allegedly imminent revolution in Europe.

informed Engels that Korff had published one of these articles in the 
New-Yorker Staatszeitung in his own name.— 120 
153 Ail that has survived from this letter is a short extract quoted by Cluss in his 
letter to Weydemeyer of 13 July 1852. The following passage from Cluss' letter 
may give an idea of what Marx wrote in the non-extant part of his letter: 
'A few days ago Marx wrote in haste some more lines from Manchester 
promising details next week. He has only 3 copies of Brumaire left. 
' "The history of the war between mice and frogs" [i.e. the pamphlet The 
Great Men of the Exile] (the first notebook up to Kinkel's departure to America) 
will appear anonymously. Marx regrets that he has to interrupt his studies in 
order to "clear the cesspool". Nevertheless, I think this is very good because it 
will protect the next revolution to some degree against this joint swindler 
company. In Marx's opinion, the whole thing is done in a very lively way and 
will come to us as soon as it is printed. He authorises us, if we think it 
economically and politically viable, to have it published in America. Think this 
over for a while.'—122 
54 Marx refers here to the French Provisional Government's decree of 16 March 
1848 which added an extra 45 centimes to every franc of direct taxes levied on 
landowners (land tax, taxes on movable property, windows and doors, patents). 
The tax became a new burden mainly for small peasants and caused them to 
join the opposition to the Second French Republic.—122 
jS In early July 1852 a number of French and German newspapers reported the 
arrests in Paris of members of a secret organisation who were making 
preparations for the assassination of Louis Bonaparte and aimed at restoring 
the republic. According to the newspapers, the arrested were mainly workers, 
several of whom had taken part in the June 1848 uprising. The newspapers 
maintained that the plot was directed by refugees in London and Brussels.— 
126, 128 
56 Engels has in mind the fact that Adolphe Chenu, the author of Les 
Conspirateurs.  Les  sociétés secrètes;  la  préfecture  de  police sous Caussidière;  les 
corps-francs (Paris, 1850), was simultaneously an organiser of secret societies 
during the July monarchy and a police informer, and that this was reflected in 
the book. Marx and Engels published a review of this book in the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue, No. 4 (see present edition, Vol. 
10).—128 
57 This refers to two documents issued in Waitzen (Vac) by Görgey, commander 
of the Upper Danubian Hungarian Corps, after the surrender of Buda to the 
counter-revolutionary troops of the Austrian Field Marshal Windischgrätz:

Notes 615 
'Statement of the Upper Danubian Royal Hungarian Corps' of 4 January 1849 
and the address 'To the Upper Danubian Royal Hungarian Corps' of 6 January 
1849.  In them Görgey unjustly accused Kossuth and the Defence Council 
headed by the latter of deserting the capital, and in fact counterposed the 
Corps to the Defence Council and put forward an independent plan of 
conducting the war. The documents were published in A. Görgei, Mein Leben 
und Wirken in Ungarn, 1. Bd., Ueipzig, 1852, S. 149-54.—128 
1,8 The due d'Enghien was condemned to death on a charge of conspiring against 
Napoleon and was executed by firing squad on 21 March 1804.—129 
:l9 Marx may have made up his mind to write on this subject when he was staying 
with Engels in Manchester from the end of May to second half of June 1852, 
but he did not carry out his plan until August, when he devoted a few articles 
for the New-York Daily Tribune to analysing political parties in England and 
exposing the anti-popular essence of the English electoral system. These articles 
were 'The Elections in England.—Tories and Whigs', 'The Chartists', 'Corrup­
tion at Elections' and 'Result of the Elections' (see present edition, Vol. 
11).—129 
160 The Mazas—a Paris prison.— 130

from France in 1848; a centre of Orleanist intrigues to restore the Orleans 
dynasty in France.—130 
162 Orlando innamorato—a chivalrous poem by Boiardo, an Italian Renaissance 
poet, published in Italy in 1495. In the sixteenth century, adaptations of this 
poem were made by Lodovico Domenichi and Francesco Berni; most popular 
was that of Berni which appeared in 1541 and was repeatedly republished. 
Boiardo's poem was republished in London in the 1830s.—131 
lti3 Here Engels alludes to the article 'Saedt' which he and Marx published in the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung, No. 225, 18 February 1849. The article ridiculed the 
mental limitation of Saedt, a Cologne public prosecutor since 1848, in 
connection with his poor speech for the prosecution at the trial of Kinkel in 
February 1849, on a charge of insulting the Prussian garrison at Mainz.—132, 
138

then the Code pénal introduced in 1811 in western and south-western Germany 
occupied by the French had been in force in Rhenish Prussia. The Code pénal 
determined the penalty for perjury, libel and similar crimes.—134, 230

68 In a letter to Cluss written at the end of June 1852, Huzel gave an account of 
Kinkel's slanderous attacks on Marx and Engels. Cluss quoted an extract from 
it in his letter to Marx of 4-5 July 1852 and Marx copied it in his letter to 
Engels of 6 August 1852 (see this volume, pp. 149-50).—139 
69 Marx ironically calls Gottfried Kinkel Johann after his wife Johanna, who 
exerted a great influence on him (see Marx and Engels, The Great Men of the 
Exile, IV and V, present edition, Vol. 11).—139 
70 This refers to the article 'Gottfried Kinkel' written by Marx and Engels in April 
1850 and published unsigned in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch­
ökonomische Revue, No. 4, 1850 (see Note 185).—139 
71 In a letter of 14 November 1851 Kinkel proposed that Cluss become a 
guarantor of the so-called German-American revolutionary loan.—140 
72 This letter of Marx to Kinkel has survived only as quoted by Cluss in his letter 
to Weydemeyer of 16 August 1852 and is reproduced in Marx's letter to Engels of 
6 August 1852 (see this volume, pp. 149-50). The texts are identical, with the 
exception of italics.— 140 
73 The American Revolutionary League—an organisation of German refugees in the 
USA set up in January 1852 by the petty-bourgeois democrats Goegg and 
Fickler who had arrived in the USA to raise the so-called German-American 
revolutionary loan (see Note  27).—141,  150, 155, 161 
74 The reference is to the secret conspiratorial organisation of German refugees 
in Paris—the German People's Union (Deutscher Volksverein) set up in 1832. 
When it was banned in 1834, a new secret revolutionary-democratic organisa­
tion of German artisans—the Outlaws' League (Bund der Geächteten) was 
formed.—143 
75 The League of the Just was established between 1836 and 1837 in Paris as a 
result of the split in the Outlaws' League and was the first political organisation 
of German workers and artisans. It had branches in Germany, France, 
Switzerland and England. Its members were greatly influenced by the ideas of 
Utopian socialism, that of Weitling in particular. In 1847 it served as a basis for 
the creation of the Communist League, the first international organisation of 
the proletariat (see Note 15).—143 
76 The reference is to the Addresses of the Central Authority to the League 
written by Marx and Engels at the end of March and in June 1850 and to the 
Address of the Central Authority in Cologne dated 1 December 1850 and 
drawn up by the associates of Marx and Engels, mainly Bürgers. The Address 
of the Central Authority of March 1850 and that of the Central Authority in 
Cologne were published in a number of German bourgeois newspapers (see 
Kölnische Zeitung, No. 156, 1 June 1851, Dresdner Journal und Anzeiger, No. 177, 
28 June 1851, and others).—143 
7' The reference is to the convention signed in Vienna on 20 May 1852 by the 
Austrian and Russian emperors and the King of Prussia in connection with the 
Bonapartist coup d'état in France on 2 December 1851. The signatories agreed 
to recognise the Bonapartist regime in France on certain conditions, which 
included the consent of the head of that regime to restrict the claim for power 
to his own lifetime and not to try to restore the Bonaparte dynasty.—143 
78 Only a short extract of this letter has survived as quoted by Cluss in his letter to 
Weydemeyer of 15 October 1852.—144

179 Marx has in mind the article on political parties in England which he wanted 
Engels to translate into English. This was in fact Marx's first own contribution 
to the New-York Daily Tribune. Marx wrote his first articles for the Tribune in 
German and sent them to Engels to be translated into English. Sometimes 
Engels divided a long article into two, which Marx then sent to the newspaper 
as separate articles. In this case too Engels divided the material received into 
two parts, which Marx sent to New York on 6 and 10 August entitled 
respectively: 'The Elections in England.—Tories and Whigs' and 'The Chartists' 
(see present edition, Vol. 11). From the end of January 1853 Marx himself 
wrote his articles for the paper in English.—145 
18<) Marx expresses his apprehension that Dana would refuse to print the article, 
because in the presidential election campaign in 1852 the New-York Daily 
Tribune supported the candidature of Scott, a representative of the American 
Whigs. 
The Whigs—members of a political party in the USA mainly representing 
the interests of the industrial and financial bourgeoisie and supported by some 
of the plantation owners. The party existed under this title from 1834 to 1854. 
The intensification of the struggle over slavery caused splits and led to 
regroupings in the ranks of the Whigs. The majority of them, with a section of 
the Democratic Party and the farmers' party (Free Soilers), formed the 
Republican Party, which opposed slavery. The rest of the Whigs sided with the 
Democratic Party, which defended the interests of the slave-owning planters.— 
145 
181 The series of articles Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany was 
published in the New-York Daily Tribune over Marx's signature (see Note 
5).—148 
182 In the margins of this letter there were vertical lines drawn by Marx at some 
time which has not been ascertained.—148, 153, 168 
18S Marx learned of these facts from Cluss' letter of 4-5 July 1852.—149 
184 The reference here is to Kossuth's circular of 28 June 1852 which Marx 
received from Cluss together with a letter of 22 July 1852. In the circular 
Kossuth urged the German refugees in America, in view of the imminent 
presidential elections, to demand that the USA should effect an armed 
interference in order to carry out a revolution in Europe. To expose the 
adventurist nature of this appeal, Cluss had the circular published in The 
New-York  Herald.  This was the immediate reason for Kossuth's departure from 
America on 14 July 1852 as he had officially declared himself a supporter of 
non-interference in the home affairs of host countries. The circular was also 
published in The People's Paper, No. 14, 7 August in the section 'Foreign News' 
under the title 'Secret Circular by Kossuth'.—150, 153, 158 
185 The reference is to Kinkel's letter to Huzel of 6 February 1852 (see p. 152).—151 
186 Presidential elections were to be held in France in May 1852 according to the 
Constitution. The petty-bourgeois democratic emigrant circles hoped that 
democracy would win in France and Louis Bonaparte would be removed from 
power because the Constitution stipulated that the outgoing President could not 
stand for re-election. After the coup d'état of 2 December 1851, however, the 
question of the President being re-elected practically no longer arose.—154

187 About 16 August 1852 Marx sent Engels a long article, which, while being 
translated, was divided into two ('Corruption at Elections' and 'Result of the 
Elections'). On their dispatch to New York they were dated 20 and 27 August 
respectively (see present edition, Vol. 11).—158 
188 This letter was first published in English abridged in K. Marx, On America 
and the Civil War, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1972. In the margins of the origi­
nal there were vertical lines drawn by Marx at a time which has not been ascer­
tained.—159 
189 xhe reference here is to the separatist organisation formed by the Willich-
Schapper adventurist sectarian group after the split in the Communist League 
(see Note 15).—160, 162 
190 An allusion to the unsuccessful attempt made in 1846-47 to publish Marx's and 
Engels' work The German Ideology (see present edition, Vol. 5).—161 
191 This letter of Marx's has not been found.—161, 183, 185, 254 
192 The reference is to the London committee of The People's Paper, set up for 
financing and distribution of the paper. Its 13 members were Chartists 
and members of the bourgeois-radical opposition who wanted to use the 
newspaper in the interests of the latter.—162, 175 
193 Engels has in mind the second part of the article on the English electoral 
system written by Marx about 16 August 1852 (see Note 187).—164 
194 On the instructions of Marx and Engels, Weydemeyer took the manuscript of 
The German Ideology to Westphalia where he failed in his negotiations for its 
publication with Julius Meyer and Rudolph Rempel, publishers in Bielefeld (see 
Note 190).—164 
195 An ironical allusion to the difficulties encountered in publishing the Chartist 
newspaper, The Star of Freedom, edited by Harney. It succeeded The Northern 
Star and ceased publication in November 1852.—164 
196 j\ reference to Huzel's letter to Cluss of 20 July 1852 which Cluss sent to Marx 
and which contained information about Kinkel's preparations for a congress of 
guarantors in America in the autumn of 1852, and gave a list of European 
guarantors of the loan. 
Huzel had a high opinion of Marx's work, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte, which he had read thanks to Cluss: I am also firmly convinced now 
that with his philosophy of destruction he will show us many more treasures 
with which we, despite all the devilish difficulties, can and must conquer the 
world.— In the Eighteenth Brumaire I find the loftiest ideas expressed in the 
most revolutionary way.'—166 
197 The reference is to the two documents: 'Entwurf des Unionsvertrags' and 'An 
das Comité zur Förderung der deutschen Nationalanleihe und an die Garanten 
dieser Anleihe in Amerika. London. 12. August 1852'. The first contained the 
terms for a preliminary agreement to amalgamate the American Revolutionary 
League and the German Emigration Club (see notes 173 and 26). 
The second document was an address to the committees and guarantors of 
the 'German-American revolutionary loan' (see Note 27). Its aim was to secure 
guarantors' preliminary consent to and approval of the amalgamation of these 
two organisations, which was to be finally formalised at the congress of 
the Revolutionary League at Wheeling (West Virginia) on 18 September

This is Marx's reply to Imandt's letter of 27 August 1852. With it Imandt sent 
Marx the 'Entwurf des L'nionsvertrags' and the circular to the guarantors of 
the loan (see Note 197) passed on to him by Kinkel and Willich. Enclosed also 
was a letter from Kinkel and Willich to Imandt of 26 August in which they 
asked the latter to give his opinion on the above-mentioned documents not 
later than 2 September 1852. 
Imandt look part in the guarantors' congress; on his actions towards the 
exposure of Kinkcl's and Willich's adventurist schemes see this volume, pp. 
151-52 and 153-57.—167

The Friends of Light (Lichtfreunde) —a religious trend that arose in 1841 and was 
directed against the pietism predominant in the Lutheran Church and 
distinguished by extreme mysticism and bigotry.—168, 172 
Marx learned all these facts from Bangya's letter of 30 August 1852. Bangya, 
being in the service of the Prussian police, tried by these means to worm his 
way into Marx's confidence. Marx soon became aware of Bangya's provocative 
activity and broke off all relations with him (see this volume, pp. 267-70).—169, 
177 
Marx alludes to a passage in the address to the guarantors of the loan issued 
on 12 August 1852 (see Note 197). In reply to the guarantors' proposal to 
found a newspaper, the document stated that revolution 'no longer needs the 
pen but the sword. A newspaper in London is of no use lor the 
revolution'.—170, 174 
The Centralisation was set up in 1836 as the leading executive organ of the 
Polish Democratic Society which arose in France in 1832 after the suppression 
of the national liberation insurrection of 1830-31 and united Left-wing Polish 
emigrants, the small nobility (szlachta) and the bourgeoisie. Its programme 
envisaged restoration of Poland's independence, abolition of the feudal 
obligations and the inequality of social estates, free transfer of land allotments 
to peasants, and a number of other progressive measures. In the summer of 
1849 the seat of the Centralisation was moved to London.—172 
The material on Vetter, Mazzini and Kossuth was used by Marx in the article 
'Movements of Mazzini and Kossuth.— League with Louis Napoleon.— 
Palmerslon' written for the New-York Daily Tribune (see present edition, Vol. 
11).—172 
The only part of this letter that has survived is an extract in Cluss' letter to 
Weydemeyer of 21 September 1852. Cluss writes: 'Herewith English notes for

revolution. The agent mentioned therein is General Vetter, a generalissimo of 
the Kossuth-Mazzini army. He vanished from London for a considerable 
stretch of time, no one knew where to. He was travelling on a passport in 
which he figured as an American painter, and with a singer by the name of 
Ferenze (his mistress). She gave concerts in all the important places. The rest 
you may read in the English. Vetter has now told the "big-wigs" [i.e. Kossuth] 
that, circumstances being what they are, he thinks he can do no better than go 
to America with Ferenze. Mazzini et Kossuth are said to be resigned to their 
fate and to have decided to leave the initiative to the French.— On 14 and 15 
September—yet another intrigue conducted by Kinkel behind the backs of the 
guarantors in London—the pro-Kinkel guarantors are to hold a meeting in 
Antwerp with a view to adopting a congressional resolution that will, it is 
hoped, serve as a weapon against the resolution passed by the American and 
Swiss guarantors.' After this Cluss quotes fragments from Marx's letter which 
are reproduced here in full. 
'Notes for the  Herald'  mentioned by Cluss are a version of Marx's article 
'Movements of Mazzini and Kossuth.—League with Louis Napoleon.— 
Palmerston' sent by Marx to Dana presumably after 5 September 1852. When 
publishing it in the New-York Daily Tribune the editors dated it 28 September 
1852.  The editors of the present edition have no information whether this 
material was published in The New-York Herald.—172 
7 Here the fragment from Marx's letter ends and is followed by a sentence which 
reveals to some extent the contents of the lost part of Marx's letter: 'Marx has 
now received 10 Brumaires and a letter from you. He does not complain about 
the material damage but solely about that caused him by this troublesome affair 
from the political and literary points of view; he says he must now fight his way 
through with fibs.' A few lines further Cluss again quotes Marx: 'I also took 
notes ... at the section meeting there.'—174 
8 Cluss does not say that this paragraph is by Marx, but textually it almost 
coincides with Marx's letter to Engels of 30 August 1852 (see this volume, p. 
170).—174

this series of articles.—181, 199 
215 Marx alludes to a passage in Massol's letter of 25 July 1852. Massol informed 
Marx that Proudhon had published a book on the coup d'état in France on 2 
December 1851 and stressed that Proudhon was only a populariser, while Marx 
was engaged in a serious analysis of the events: 'Dig, search, keep at it; that is

218 Engels has in mind the state of Heinzen's New York newspaper Janus which 
published attacks on the Communist League and carried insinuations against 
Marx and Engels personally.—185 
219 The reference is to the great fuss in the newspapers over Louis Bonaparte's 
tour of France on 14-16 September 1852, whose purpose was to secure support 
in the provinces, among the French clergy in particular, for his proclamation as 
Emperor of France under the title of Napoleon III, which took place on 2 
December 1852.—185 
220 The Customs Union of the German states was set up in 1834 under the aegis of 
Prussia because of the need to create an all-German market. During the 
1848-49 revolution the Customs Union practically ceased to exist, but in 1853 
Prussia managed to revive it and it continued to exist up to 1871. 
By the 'Customs Union business' Marx means a conference on the subject 
which was to be convened in Vienna on 30 October 1852.—186, 195

agreement was signed by Goegg on behalf of the Revolutionary League in 
America, and by Kinkel and Willich as members of the managing committee of 
the so-called German-American revolutionary loan (see notes 173 and 27). The 
aim of the Volksverein was to attract Englishmen as well as German refugees. 
However, owing to its adventurism and to persisting discord among the 
petty-bourgeois emigrants, the Volksverein was as short-lived as other such 
emigrant organisations before it.— 194 
227 Two religious opposition movements, the so-called German-Catholicism, and the 
Protestant 'free communities', appeared in the 1840s. They sought to establish an 
all-German national church and rejected the supremacy of the Pope and many 
dogmas and rites of the Roman Catholic Church. They expressed the German 
bourgeoisie's discontent with the icactionary system in Germany and its striving 
to unify the country politically. In 1850 the German-Catholics merged with the 
'free communities'.— 194, 267

252 Haupt, a former member of the Communist League, was arrested at the time 
of the Cologne Communist Trial and gave false evidence during the 
investigation. The police released him before the trial and he escaped to Brazil. 
His evidence, damaging to the accused, was cited in Seckendorf's speech for the 
prosecution on 3 November  1852.—  215

Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (present edition, Vol.  11).—  216 
255 On Engels' advice (see this volume, pp. 208-09), Marx tried through Weerth 
to get information from the bookseller Duncker about a certain Eisenmann 
with whom Bangya had allegedly negotiated the publication of Marx's 
and Engels' pamphlet, The Great Men of the Exile.— 216 
256 Marx's letter to lawyer Schneider II of 26 October 1852 has not been 
found.—217 
257 Engels' letter to Marx of 26 October 1852 has not been found.—218 
258 Engels refers to Marx's letter to Schneider II of 26 October 1852 which 
contained Stieber's evidence (see Marx's letter to Engels of 26 October 1852). 
Engels sent two copies of it by messengers to Cologne on 27 October: the 
original in Marx's hand care of Braubach Bros and a copy care of Johann 
Philipp Becker. Marx himself sent the third and fourth copies, addressed to 
Hermann Ebner and Georg Gottlob Jung, from London. This is proved by a 
list of documents dispatched to Cologne during the Communist Trial drawn up 
by Engels on about 31 October 1852 (see present edition, Vol.  11).—  218 
259 At the Cologne trial on 23 October 1852 Stieber presented in evidence against 
the accused the so-called Original Minute-book of the meetings of the 
Communist League Central Authority, alleged to have been formed again by 
Marx in London after the arrests in Cologne. According to Stieber's false 
evidence, the Minute-book was compiled by Rings and Liebknecht. In reality it 
was fabricated by the spy Wilhelm Hirsch, exposed by and expelled from the 
Communist League about 19 February 1852. Because of his expulsion it was 
decided to change the place and day of the weekly meetings of the London 
District members of the Communist League. Hirsch did not know about this 
and continued to date the fabricated minutes Thursday, whereas the meetings 
were then held on Wednesdays. By sending samples of Hirsch's and later 
Rings' and Liebknecht's handwriting to Cologne, Engels wanted to provide 
counsel for the defence with documents which would expose the actual author 
of the 'Original Minute-book'. Thanks to the material supplied by Marx and 
Engels the police fabrications were exposed and the 'Original Minute-book' was 
rejected as evidence for the prosecution (see present edition, Vol.  11).—  218,

260 Trie 'Original Minute-book' (see Note 259) presented by Stieber to the jury 
mentioned letters allegedly written to Marx by Mrs Daniels, the wife of one of 
the accused. On 25 October 1852, the Kölnische Zeitung, No. 273, published a 
statement made by King's Counsel Müller, father of Mrs Daniels, denying that 
Mrs Daniels had corresponded with Marx and declaring Stieber's 'Original 
Minute-book' a 'mystification'.—219, 301 
2hl The reference is to Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see 
present edition, Vol. 11). Marx began writing the pamphlet at the end of 
October 1852, when the trial of the Communist League members was still in 
progress in Cologne, and completed it in early December. On 6 December a 
copy of the manuscript was sent to the publisher Schabelitz junior in 
Switzerland, and on the following day a second copy was dispatched to Cluss in 
the USA. The pamphlet was published in Basle in January 1853, but almost the 
whole edition (2,000 copies) was confiscated by the police in March in the 
Baden frontier village of Weill on the way to Germany. In the USA the work 
was first published in instalments in the democratic Boston Neu-England-
Zeitung and at the end of April 1853 it was printed as a separate pamphlet by 
the same publishers.— 220 
262 An allusion to the campaign in French government circles for the proclamation 
of an empire (see Note 219).— 221 
263 jn  the iist 0f documents dispatched to Cologne during the Communist Trial 
this letter of Marx, which has not been found, is dated Monday, 25 October 
1852 (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 590).—222 
264 This is presumably a slip of the pen, for in Revelations Concerning the Communist 
Trial in Cologne, Chapter III, 'The Cherval Plot' (present edition, Vol. 11, p. 
413),  it is said that Cherval was admitted to the League of the Just in 1846, i.e. 
before it was reorganised into the Communit League in June 1847.— 222 
265 This material was used by the lawyer Schneider II in his speech at the trial on 
4 November 1852 and later by Marx in the pamphlet Revelations Concerning the 
Communist Trial in Cologne (see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 413, 417 and 
418).—222 
266 The reference is to Marx's correspondence with Hermann Becker concerning 
the publication of Marx's works. Negotiations to that effect started in December 
1850 and resulted in the publication of the first issue of Cesammelte Aufsätze von 
Karl Marx in Cologne at the end of April 1851. It contained the article 
'Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship Instruction' and part of the first 
article from 'Proceedings of the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly' written by 
Marx in 1842 (see present edition, Vol. 1). Publication was discontinued 
following Becker's arrest.—222 
267 Roland Daniels sent his manuscript 'Mikrokosmos. Entwurf einer physiologi­
schen Anthropologie' from Cologne in mid-February 1851 for Marx to review it. 
In his letter to Daniels of 20 March (it has not been found) Marx expressed his 
opinion of the manuscript. Daniels' work remained unpublished because of his 
arrest in June 1851 in connection with the Cologne Communist Trial.—222 
268 Marx has in mind the minutes which Hirsch kept in the Workers' Society 
presided over by Stechan, a refugee from Hanover (see Note 25).—222 
269 Stieber's letter to Marx of 26 December 1848, which Marx quotes below.—222

626 Notes 
271 This excerpt from Becker's letter to Marx of 27 January 1851 is quoted by 
Marx in Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see present 
edition, Vol. 11, p. 452).—224 
272 Marx's letter to Bermbach has not been found.— 224 
273 Van Diemen's Land—the name initially given by Europeans to the island of 
Tasmania, which was a British penal colony up to  1853.—  224 
274 The reference is to the duel between Barthélémy and the French refugee 
Cournet about 25 October 1852 in which the latter was killed. Barthélémy was 
sentenced to two months' imprisonment.—  224,  295 
275 This letter of Stieber's was used by the lawyer Schneider II in his speech at the 
trial on 4 November 1852 to expose Stieber's past spying activity; Marx quoted 
this letter in full in Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see 
present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 435-36).— 226 
276 The separatist Central Authority was set up by the Willirh-Schapper group 
after the split in the Communist League in September 1850 (see Note 
15).—226 
277 This refers to the Social-Democratic Committee of Support for German Refugees 
formed at the German Workers' Educational Society in London on 18 
September 1849. The Committee included Karl Marx, Heinrich Bauer, Karl 
Pfänder, Karl Blind, Anton Fiister and Frederick Engels (from 3 December 
1849).  In mid-September 1850 Marx and Engels withdrew from the Refugee 
Committee because the majority of its members had come under the influence 
of the Willich-Schapper group.— 227 
278 nere  Marx ironically writes about Stieber's attempt, in his evidence on 18 
October 1852, to reduce the disagreements existing between the supporters of 
Marx and Engels and the Willich-Schapper group to the question of personal 
rivalry. He ascribed to Marx an aspiration to become a dictator of Germany 
after a future revolution and to appoint his associates and friends ministers.— 
227 
279 In this connection see K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in 
Cologne (present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 422-23). In his speech on 4 November 
1852 Schneider II exposed Stieber's falsification of facts connected with the 
confiscation of Marx's letter to Kothes.— 228 
280 Engels' letter to von Hontheim of 30 October 1852 has not been found.—231 
281 The Red Catechism (Rother Katechismus für das deutsche Volk) and the letter 
accompanying it were written by Moses Hess who supported the Willich-
Schapper group. The letter was faked by imitating Marx's handwriting. Marx 
exposed this forgery in a statement sent to the editor of The Morning Advertiser 
and published in that newspaper on 2 November (see present edition, Vol. 11, 
pp. 380-81). Schneider II's intention to read this statement of Marx at the trial 
on 4 November drew a protest from the prosecution, but they were forced to 
give up the idea of using 'the accompanying letter' against the accused (see also 
K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, present edition, 
Vol. 11, pp. 443-45).—232 
282 On Engels' advice, Marx gave evidence on the points listed above, had it 
certified and sent to Cologne where it was used at the trial by Schneider 
II.—232

284 On 21 October 1852 Duncker wrote to Weerth that there was no publisher by 
the name of Eisenmann (see Note 255). 
Kothes was arrested because the police had intercepted a letter which Marx 
sent to his address to be delivered to Bermbach (on this see Revelations

288 The  reference is to a letter of 28 October 1852 composed by Bangya in the 
name of Charles Collmann, a publisher invented by him, concerning the 
preparations made for publishing Marx's and Engels' manuscript The Great 
Men of the Exile. The letter was not written on a publishers' notepaper and had 
no post marks. It contained Bangya's note dated 3 November 1852 asking 
Marx to acquaint himself with Collmann's letter.—237, 239 
289 The reference is to Bürgers' trip from Cologne to Hanover, Hamburg, Berlin, 
Breslau and Dresden made in May 1851 on an assignment from the Cologne 
Central Authority. The prosecution tried to present Bürgers' trip and his 
participation in drawing up the Manifesto of the Cologne Central Authority of 
the Communist League, and also Nothjung's journey to Leipzig in May 1851 
mentioned below, as proof of their involvement in a communist plot.—238 
290 The Crystal Palace was built of metal and glass for the first world trade and 
industrial exhibition in London in 1851.—238 
291 After the 'Original Minute-book' was exposed at the trial as a forgery (see Note 
259),  Stieber sent police lieutenant Goldheim to London. On his return 
Goldheim stated at the trial on 3 November 1852 that the book mentioned was 
not 'a minute-book', but a 'notebook', and that it was actually sold by 
H. Liebknecht, alleged to be the compiler of the minutes, to the Prussian agent 
Fleury and contained notes on communists' secret meetings at Marx's house. 
Goldheim asserted that he had seen a cash receipt in Liebknecht's own 
handwriting. He also spoke of a 'top secret meeting' at Marx's on 27 October 
1852 in connection with the Cologne trial. On 4 November 1852 lawyer 
Schneider II proved that this evidence for the prosecution was also false. On 
this see Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (present edition, 
Vol. 11, pp. 429-35 and 438-39).—240, 242

293 The meeting in memory of Robert Blum in London on 9 November 1852 was 
organised by Arnold Ruge and his associates. Speeches were made by Ruge, 
Tausenau, Ronge and other bourgeois radicals and democrats.—241, 246 
294 Marx learned about this from lawyer Schneider II's letter of 1 November 
1852.—242

295 On Bangya's provocative role in the matter of publishing Marx's and 
Engels' pamphlet The Great Men of the Exile see Marx's article 'Hirsch's Con­
fessions' (present edition, Vol. 12). 
The second part of the pamphlet (see Note 131) was probably not written, 
though the last lines of this work contain a definite hint that the account of 
German petty-bourgeois refugees' activities will be continued. Marx's pamphlet 
Herr Vogt, Chapter XII: 'Appendices', Section 6 'The War between Frogs and 
Mice' contains material on the activity of petty-bourgeois refugee organisations 
in 1852 (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 313-15).—242 
29fi Fleury's statement proving the falseness of Goldheim's evidence was not 
published in the Kölnische Zeitung. Counsel for the defence got possession of it 
after the trial. Marx quoted it in Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in 
Cologne (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 442).—243 
297 Marx wrote this statement on 21 October 1852; the text has not survived. Marx 
explains in Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne why the 
German newspapers refused to publish it (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 
436).—244 
298 Marx gives these facts in Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne 
(present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 442 and 451-52). Additional information about 
Hirsch's contacts with the Prussian police agents Greif and Fleury, and the role 
of the Prussian Embassy in London during the Cologne trial, is to be found in 
Herr Vogt, 'Appendices', Section 4 'The Communist Trial in Cologne' (see 
present edition, Vol.  17).—  245 
299 xhe reference is to the publication in October 1852 of a lithographed 
statement of accounts and of a statement by Reichenbach who was the treasurer 
of the so-called German-American revolutionary loan (see Note 27). Reichen­
bach refused to be in charge of the funds because the idea of the revolutionary 
loan did not justify  itself.  Later Marx quoted extracts from Reichenbach's 
statement in Herr Vogt, 'Appendices', Section 6 'The War between Frogs and 
Mice' (see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 314).—245, 246, 275, 282, 302 
300 On Engels' advice Marx wrote to the Frankfurt journalist Ebner asking him 
whether it would be possible to publish the pamphlet on the Cologne 
Communist Trial there (see this volume, pp. 238-39 and Note 122). Marx's letter 
to Ebner has not been found.— 245

English bourgeois radicals on Mazzini's initiative in order to interest the English 
public in Italy's national liberation.—246 
302 Only the author's copy of this letter has survived in Marx's notebook for 1860 
among material relating to his work on Herr Vogt.— 247 
303 Marx sent the German original of the statement to Cluss in America on 18 
November 1852. Marx's letter has not been found. The statement dated 18 
November 1852 was published in the New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung, No. 39, 10 
December 1852. Its text differed from the English version edited by Engels at 
Marx's request and published in English papers, dated 20 November 
1852.—247

307 After the 1830 revolution in France, the opposition movement of the so-called 
demagogues (see Note 139) became more intense in Germany. This caused new 
police repressions and arrests and increased emigration, especially after an 
attempt had been made to effect a coup d'état in Frankfurt am Main on 3 
April 1833 with the aim of establishing a republic.—251

312 After the Bonapartist coup d'état of 2 December 1851 intensive preparations 
were made to proclaim France an empire. On 21 and 22 November 1852 a 
referendum was held on the issue: on 2 December France was officially 
proclaimed an empire, and the Prince President Louis Napoleon became 
Emperor Napoleon III. In the period preceding the proclamation of the 
empire numerous decrees concerning, among other things, the economy and 
finance were promulgated. Here Marx has in mind two decrees of 18 
November 1852: on the foundation of the Société générale du Crédit mobilier 
and on the handing over of several railways to the Compagnie du chemin de 
fer de Lyon à Avignon founded on 8 July 1852 (both decrees were published 
in Le Moniteur universel, No. 325, 20 November 1852). The Crédit mobilier 
became a big joint-stock bank which acted as intermediary in credit and 
stockjobbing operations and took part in building railways in France and other 
European countries.—257, 263

The international Peace Congress was convened by the bourgeois pacifist

A reference to the Milan insurrection started on 6 February 1853 by the 
followers of the Italian revolutionary Mazzini and supported by Hungarian 
revolutionary refugees. The aim of the insurgents, who were mostly Italian 
workers, was to overthrow Austrian rule. The insurrection was badly organised 
and was soon suppressed. Marx analysed it in a number of articles (see present

(see,  e.g., 'M. M. Kossuth and Mazzini and The Times', The Daily News, 
No. 2105, 18 February 1853) assaying on behalf of Kossuth that tiie latter did 
not take part in the Milan insurrection (see Note 335) and declaring diat the 
address 'In the Name of the Hungarian Nation.—To the Soldiers Quartered in 
Italy' circulated over Kossuth's signature during the insurrection was a

1 Marx has in mind here the English workers' movement for observance by the 
manufacturers of the Ten Hours' Bill adopted by Parliament in 1847, for its 
application to all categories of workers and for the repeal of the 1850 law, 
which despite the 1847 Bill established a lO'/ä-hour working day. Marx 
analyses this movement in 'Parliamentary Debates.—The Clergy Against 
Socialism.— Starvation' (see present edition, Vol. 11).—282 
2 Marx refers to the speech made by John Russell, leader of the Whig Party and 
member of the Aberdeen Coalition Government, at the opening of Parliament 
on 10 February 1853. Marx analysed this speech in 'The Italian Insurrection.— 
British Politics' (see present edition, Vol. 11).—282 
3 A reference to John Aberdeen's Coalition Ministry of 1852-55 (the Cabinet of 
All the Talents), which consisted of Whigs, Peelites and representatives of the 
Irish faction. Marx described this Ministry in 'A Superannuated Administra­

11).—284 
4 A reference to questions in Parliament in connection with rumours that the 
reactionary governments of the continental powers, Austria in the first place, 
intended to demand that the British Government should deport political 
refugees, Mazzini and Kossuth in particular. On 1 March 1853 Palmerston 
denied in the House of Commons that such demands had been made and 
declared that, should they be made, the British Government would categorically 
reject them. However, on 4 March, Aberdeen, head of the Cabinet, stated in 
the House of Lords that the government was ready to take proceedings against 
the refugees.— 284 
5 In June 1850 the British Parliament debated the Anglo-Greek conflict over the 
so-called Pacifico incident. The house in Athens of this Portuguese merchant, a 
British subject, was burnt in 1847 and this served as a pretext for Palmerston 
to send ships to the Greek coast and present an ultimatum to the Greek 
Government.—  284,  455 
fi The debate on the Address took place at the opening of Parliament in 1850. The 
usual procedure of drawing up a reply to the Speech from the Throne was 
used as a pretext for a comprehensive criticism of Russell's Whig Government, 
of which Palmerston was a member.—284 
7 On 3 March 1853 the radical Hume moved in the House of Commons that all 
tariffs which were in the slightest degree protectionist should be annulled. 
Marx expressed his opinion on Hume's motion and on Gladstone's and other 
Cabinet members' attitude to the question in 'Achievements of the Ministry' 
(see present edition, Vol.  12).—  284

additional information about the attack on Francis Joseph and about Kossuth 
(presumably not published by the newspaper); 7. 'Forced Emigration.— Kossuth

Prussian Government.— Austro-Prussian Commercial Treaty.— The Times and 
the Refugees', which Marx planned to send off on 11 March, was presumably 
written between 12 and 18 March and published on 4 April 1853 (see present 
edition, Vol. 11).—288 
352 A reference to articles by Aurelius Ferenc Pulszky, a Hungarian journalist and 
supporter of Kossuth. As an émigré in London he contributed to the New-York 
Daily Tribune from 1853 to 1860. He signed his articles 'A. P. C, presumably 
an abbreviation for Aurelius Pulszky's Correspondence. Marx did not learn 
about Pulszky's contribution to the New-York Daily Tribune until several years 
later.—288 
3,-)3 The entente cordiale —an expression used to denote the rapprochement between 
France and Britain after the July 1830 revolution. 
The Holy Alliance—an association of European monarchs founded in 1815 
to suppress revolutionary movements and preserve feudal monarchies in 
European countries. The Holy Alliance, in which the main role was played by 
Russia, Austria and Prussia, was dissolved in the late 1820s, but after the 1830 
and 1848-49 revolutions attempts were made to resurrect it.—289 
354 In compliance with Marx's request Engels wrote for the New-York Daily Tribune 
between 12 March and early April 1853: 'British Politics.— Disraeli.—The 
Refugees.—Mazzini in London.—Turkey' (jointly with Marx), 'The Real Issue 
in Turkey', 'The Turkish Question' and 'What Is to Become of Turkey in 
Europe?' (see present edition, Vol. 12).—289 
355 An allusion to Countess Sophie Hatzfeldt's divorce case. Lassalle was in charge 
of it from 1846 to 1854 and, after the divorce had been granted by the court in 
July 1851, tried in particular to secure for the Countess her share of the 
common property of the former couple.—293, 478 
356 Engels used this information in the article for the New-York Daily Tribune 'The 
Real Issue in Turkey' (see present edition, Vol. 12).—295 
357 A reference to the Canada Clergy Reserves founded in 1791-1840, which 
consisted of a seventh of the revenue from the sale of lands in Canada and 
were used chiefly to subsidise the Established and Presbytarian churches. The 
discontent of other churches with such a distribution of funds compelled the 
British Parliament to pass a law in 1853 authorising the Canadian legislative 
bodies to distribute these funds among the different churches according to the 
proportion of the population professing their respective beliefs. Marx described 
this Bill and the debate on it in the House of Commons in 'Achievements of 
the Ministry' (see present edition, Vol. 12).—295 
358 This letter is a reply to Cluss' letter of 6 March 1853. The unanswered letters

5-8.—305 
36.K jn {Tenruary l#46j when an attempt was made to start a revolt in the Polish 
lands to secure the national liberation of Poland and the insurgents managed to 
win a temporary victory in Cracow, the Galician peasants also rose in revolt. 
The oppressed Ukrainian peasants hated the Polish szlachta, and the Austrian 
authorities succeeded in several places in turning the rebellious peasants against 
the Polish insurgents. After the suppression of the Cracow revolt, the Galician 
peasants were also crushed.— 306

In the early 1850s the struggle between Prussia and Austria for supremacy in 
Germany again became acute: in particular, Austria, with the support of Russia, 
hampered Prussia's attempts to restore the Customs Union (see Note 220). 
After the coup d'état in France in December 1851 a new war threatened 
Europe because Bonapartist circles wished to restore the frontiers of the First 
Empire. In connection with this Austria made certain concessions when 
negotiating a trade agreement with Prussia (see Note  350).—  307 370

The spring campaign of 1349 in Northern Italy began after Austria and 
Piedmont resumed hostilities on 12 March. At the decisive battle of Novara on 
22-23 March 1849 the Austrian army under Radetzky defeated the Piedmon-
tese troops. As a result Austrian rule was restored in Northern Italy.— 310 
The Vilâgos affair—the capitulation of the main forces of the Hungarian 
revolutionary army under Görgey to Paskievich's troops on 13 August 
1849.—  310 
The Hungarian revolutionary army relieved Komarom on 22 April 1849 (see 
Note 134).—310 
In the spring of 1849 Hungarian troops under Bern marched to the Banat, a 
district in the Serbian Voivodina, then part of Hungary. 
In speaking of the manoeuvre before Hermannstadt (Sibiu), Engels lias in 
mind the successful operations of Bern's troops during the campaign in 
Transylvania in February-March 1849. During the general advance of the 
Russian troops in summer 1849 Bern returned to Transylvania, again marched 
to Hermannstadt, drove out the Russian garrison but, faced by superior forces 
of the Russian and Austrian armies, was compelled to retreat.— 311 
The extract from this letter is printed as quoted by Cluss in a letter to 
Weydemeyer of 3 May 1853. It was published in English for the first time 
abridged in K. Marx and F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, Interna­
tional Publishers, New York, 1953.—312 
The reference is to a series of articles by Pieper published under the general 
heading 'A Critical History of French Socialism' in The People's Paper, Nos. 
31-33,  4, 11 and 18 December 1852. Weydemeyer and Cluss planned to publish 
these articles in Die Reform, but Pieper did not finish the series.— 312 
Here Marx has in mind Pieper's material difficulties. On 18 April 1853 Pieper 
applied to Engels for help, as he could not receive money due to him for 
private lessons. On receipt of Pieper's letter Engels propably wrote to Marx 
between 19 and 23 April 1853 inquiring about Pieper's situation. Engels' letter 
has not been found.— 314 
Marx received Engels' article on Switzerland on 26 April 1853 and dispatched 
it with his own article to New York on 29 April 1853. The editors published 
the material on Switzerland as two articles. The first article, including Marx s 
material, was entitled 'The Rocket Affair.—The Swiss Insurrection' and was 
published on 14 May 1853; the second article appeared on 17 May 1853 undei 
the heading 'Political Position of the Swiss Republic'; the date of its dispatch 
from London—1 May 1853—was arbitrarily supplied by the editors (see 
present edition, Vol. 12). The newspaper published both articles over Marx's 
name, though the first was written by Marx and Engels, and the second bv 
Engels.— 314, 319, 321 
Marx's letter to Strohn is not extant.—315 
In April 1853 as a pretext for reprisals against political refugees, the British 
authorities accused the proprietor of a rocket manufactory in Rotherhithe, in 
London, of a conspiracy with Kossuth which Marx ironically calls 'Kossuth's 
gunpowder plot' by analogy with the Catholic gunpowder plot against James I in 
England in 1605. In March 1853 the Prussian police arrested several liberal 
and radical bourgeois leaders in Berlin in an effort to trump up a new 
conspiracy case. These government and police actions are described in Marx's

Marx presumably refers to his letters to Cluss of 25 March and 17 April 1853 
(see this volume, pp. 298-300 and 312-14) and one of about 10 April 1853 
which is not extant. As emerges from Cluss' letter to Marx of 28 April 1853, 
Marx dealt in it with the publication in America of Revelations Concerning the 
Communist Trial in Cologne as a separate book.—317 
An allusion to the past of Henri Savoye, professor of German at Louis-Ie-
Grand college in 1841-48 and the author of several works on Germany and the 
German language.— 317 
An abridged translation of this letter was published for the first time as an

Friedrich Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary and 
Notes,  Martin Lawrence Ltd., London,  1934.—  319

Engels and their associates to help the Communist League members accused in 
Cologne and their families.— 323 
On 21 May 1853 Jones published in The People's Paper an appeal to organise 
workers' meetings in favour of the People's Charter. At the time Marx wrote 
several articles for the New-York Daily Tribune on the revival of the Chartist 
movement (see present edition, Vol.  12).—  325 
Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester from 30 April to 19 May and returned 
to London on 20 May 1853.—325, 335 
An abridged translation of this letter was published for the first time in Karl 
Marx and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895, London, 1934. It was 
erroneously dated 'about 18 May  1853'.  In later English publications the date 
of the letter was verified (see Marx and Engels, Selected  Correspondence,  Progress 
Publishers, Moscow, 1965).—325 
Willich slanderously represented his duel with Schramm in September 1850 
(see Note 360) as an attempt by Marx and Engels to get rid of him by having 
him killed. Marx refuted this slander in his pamphlet The Knight of the Noble 
Consciousness (see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 492-95).—326 
Die Reform was the organ of the American Workers' Association consisting 
mostly of German emigrant workers. Though officially its editor was the 
petty-bourgeois democrat Kellner, the newspaper's tendency was determined to 
a great extent by Weydemeyer, who became the newspaper's actual editor in 
the summer of 1853. Under his influence the paper retained its commitment to 
the working class for some time. It often reprinted Marx's and Engels' articles 
from the New-York Daily Tribune. Marx persuaded his associates (Eccarius, 
Pieper and Dronke) to co-operate with Die Reform, which regularly published 
articles and reports by Cluss and Weydemeyer, some based on material from 
Marx's letters. Towards the end of its existence (1854), the petty-bourgeois 
influence of its editor-in-chief, Kellner, became dominant.—326 
Marx and Engels talked about this during Marx's visit to Manchester from 30 
April to 19 May 1853.—326

exposure of Marx in that newspaper, and the disclosure of facts he had not 
hitherto wished to make public. However, he only carried out his threat six 
months later by publishing a slanderous article, 'Doctor Karl Marx und seine 
"Enthüllungen"', in the Belletristisches Journal und New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung,

of Herzen' that he 'was the first to raise the great banner of struggle by addressing 
his free Russian word to the masses' (V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 18, p. 31). 
Nikolai Ogarev, another prominent figure among the Russian revolutionary 
democrats, also took part in the management of the Free Russian Press. Besides a 
large number of books, pamphlets and leaflets, the Free Russian Press published 
the periodicals Tlojinpuan  3ee.ida  (The Polar Star) and Kojimojib (The Bell), which 
played a great part in developing the revolutionary and democratic movement in 
Russia. In April 1865 the Free Russian Press was moved to Geneva, where it

Only an extract of this letter has survived as quoted by Cluss in his letter to 
Weydemeyer of 28 June 1853. Part of it was published in English for the first 
time in K. Marx and F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, International 
Publishers, New York, 1953.—348 
Further Cluss gives the substance of Marx's letter in his own words: 'About the 
money business Marx says: He has never accepted any financial support; as for 
the case trumpeted forth by Willich, it was roughly as follows: Marx, it is said, 
had rented a house in Chelsea (London) as a subtenant, paid his monthly rent 
regularly, often at the price of great privation. Then the actual owner of the 
house suddenly turns up and seizes on Marx, as the sublessor has paid nothing 
for a year. English law authorises this procedure. Marx cannot pay, a broker is 
installed in the house, etc. Marx in a very unfortunate position.— He is a 
member of the Refugee Relief Committee. The moneys are paid out weekly to 
individual refugees. The total sum, however, which is provided for the greater 
part by our friends in Europe, is lying idle, and so Marx is "saved", by being 
granted the necessary sum on condition that he pays it back in fixed 
instalments when it is required for other refugees—those, it appears, who are 
alone entitled to  relief.  This he did conscientiously, and paid back everything, 
partly out of his own earnings and partly out of money he got from his family. 
C'est  tout [That's all]. 
'I have no lack of material to spin this out; on the contrary, there is an 
abundance of it. The same applies to the sacrifices he made for the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung, when the bourgeoisie fell away after the June Revolution 
[proletarian uprising in Paris in 1848], and the democratic petty bourgeoisie 
after the state of siege was introduced in Cologne. That's quite something. 
Marx says he spent about 7,000 talers for the N. Rh. Z. ... He says, too, that I 
can and should make use of all the material he gives me, without however 
involving him in this business as a witness. Reform: Marx says J am right. He 
says half Germany will come to New York for the industrial exhibition, and as 
we have no other publication in this city, we should simply take no notice of the 
stupidities of the Hornisse gentlemen [the editor of the Reform Gottlieb Kellner 
and its London correspondent Heinrich Heise published Die Hornisse in Cassel 
in 1848-50] and prudently steer our own course. As is well known, Talleyrand 
always called to his statesmen: "Avant tout, pas de zèle, pas de zèle!"  ["Above 
all, not too much zeal, not too much zeal!"].'—348 
A twenty-five thousand-strong political demonstration was organised by the 
Chartists in Halifax on 26 June 1853 on the occasion of the funeral of 
Benjamin Ruston, an old Chartist worker. Marx wrote about this demonstration 
in the article 'Russian Policy Against Turkey.—Chartism' (see present edition, 
Vol. 12).—350

Marx refers here to the articles on Russian foreign policy, in particular with 
respect to Turkey, in The Morning Advertiser (e.g. of 6 and 7 September 1853, 
etc.) and in the New-York Daily Tribune. Those in The Morning Advertiser were 
written by Karl Blind and those in the Tribune by Adam Gurowski.— 365 
In a letter of 31 July 1853 sent to Ferdinand Freiligrath who passed it on to 
Marx on 18 August, the Communist League member Carl Wilhelm Klein 
reported on the formation of a new Communist League community in 
Philadelphia, where he was living in emigration at the time. He asked the 
Communist League members in London to help him establish contacts with the 
communities in Germany and to send in articles for Gradaus, a German 
refugees' newspaper close to the Working Men's Association in Philadelphia at 
the time. Simultaneously, Marx received from Cluss and Weydemeyer, in reply 
to his inquiry, information about Klein's own unseemly conduct in Philadelphia. 
Taking into account Klein's influence among the Solingen workers, Marx 
recommended that Cluss should maintain contact with him. Marx's reply to 
Klein's letter has not been found.—365, 367 
An extract from this letter is extant as quoted by Cluss in his letter to 
Weydemeyer of 3 October 1853.—366 
Presumably an allusion to the fact that Poesche used the article 'Geld' in Meyer's 
Conversations-Lexicon (Vol. 12, Hildburghausen, Amsterdam, Paris and Philadel­

The article 'The Western Powers and Turkey.— Imminent Economic Crisis.— 
Railway Construction in India' was written jointly by Marx and Engels on 19-20 
September 1853.—368, 370 
The knife and fork question—words, which came to symbolise the Chartists' social 
programme, pronounced by an English priest and Chartist, J. R. Stephens, at a 
meeting in 1838. See Engels, The Condition of the Working-Class in England 
(present edition, Vol. 4, p. 519).—372, 377 
Presumably Marx mentioned his intention to write articles on these subjects in 
a no longer extant letter to Engels written between 17 and 28 September 
1853.—374 
Marx's 'The War Question.— Financial Matters.—Strikes' (dated 7 October 
1853) suggests that Engels sent in the promised material and Marx worked it 
up for this article (see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 409-15).—  374,  376 
In September 1853 the Preston manufacturers responded with a lockout to one 
of the biggest strikes by English workers in the 1850s. The strike was started by 
the weavers and spinners of mills in and around Preston who demanded a ten 
per cent wage rise; they were supported by workers in other trades. The 
lockout lasted until February 1854, but the strike continued after that date. To 
break the strike the Manufacturers' Association started bringing workers to 
Preston from Ireland and from English workhouses. In March 1854 the leaders 
of the strike were arrested, and as funds were low the workers were compelled 
to return to work. The strike ended in May 1854 (see K. Marx, 'Panic on the 
London Stock Exchange.—Strikes', present edition, Vol. 12).—374, 376, 513 
Textile mill workers and some  5,000  miners went on strike in Wigan (see

433 Marx carried out his plans in February and March 1854 by writing 'Russian 
Diplomacy.—The Blue Book on the Eastern Question—Montenegro' and 
'Declaration of War.—On the History of the Eastern Question' (see present 
edition, vols. 12 and 13). He wrote two articles on Denmark (21 October and 4 
November 1853): 'Arrest of Delescluze.— Denmark.— Austria.— The Times on 
the Prospects of War Against Russia' and 'Persian Expedition in Afghanistan 
and Russian Expedition in Central Asia.—Denmark.—The Fighting on the 
Danube and in Asia.—Wigan Colliers' (see present edition, Vol.  12).—  376 
434 Only part of this letter is extant.—377 
435 At first Wilhelm Wolff intended to emigrate to the USA.— 377 
436 A reference to the first article in the series Lord Palmerston which Marx was 
working on from early October to early December 1853 (see present edition, 
Vol. 12). The pamphlet Lord Palmerston was intended for the New-York Daily 
Tribune. Simultaneously the articles were published in the Chartist People's 
Paper, which published eight articles from 22 October to 24 December 1853 as 
a single series, each article being preceded by the editorial note: 'Written for 
the New-York Tribune by Dr. Marx, and communicated by him to us.' The 
New-York Daily Tribune published only four articles (their contents corres­
ponded to six articles in The People's Paper) as leaders, outwardly unconnected 
and with different titles. The sixth and eighth articles of the series were not 
published in the Tribune at all. 
At Marx's request Cluss translated into German the first article published in 
the Tribune. It was published abridged in New York in the German-language 
workers' newspaper Die Reform, Nos. 72, 73, 74, 77 and 78, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 
November 1853. In December 1853 Cluss translated the second and third 
articles of the pamphlet from the Tribune and the fourth from The People's 
Paper. The editors of this edition do not have a complete file of Die Reform for 
1854 at their disposal; it is therefore impossible to say whether the publication 
of the German translation was continued.— 378 
437 On 5 August 1853 the House of Lords rejected the Combination of Workmen 
Bill which would have granted limited rights to workers' organisations. In this 
context Marx denounced the anti-working-class policy of both the ruling 
oligarchy and the liberal and radical bourgeoisie. In the atmosphere of a mass 
strike movement, the manufacturers created 'an association for the purpose of 
aiding the trade in regulating the excitement among operatives in the 
Manchester district' and resolutely opposed the organisation of workers' 
associations (see K. Marx, 'The War Question.— British Population and Trade 
Returns.— Doings of Parliament', present edition, Vol. 12). Marx thought it 
necessary to draw the workers' attention to the fact that the bourgeoisie was 
consolidating its forces; with this aim in view he wanted to provide Jones with 
facts before his tour of the strike districts. In an article written on 7 October, 
i.e. the day after his meeting with Jones, Marx wrote: 'The London press, it 
appears, was anxious to withhold the fact from the eyes of the world, that the 
Factory Lords were systematically arraying their class against the class of Labor, 
and that the successive steps taken by them, instead of being the spontaneous 
result of circumstances, are the premeditated effects of a deep-laid conspiracy 
of an organized Anti-Labor League!" (see present edition, Vol. 12, p. 412). 
To help the strikers a group of Chartists headed by Jones suggested the 
setting up of a coordinating workers' organisation, The Mass Movement, which

was to unite Chartists, members of co-operative associations, trade unionists 
and unorganised workers (see Note  498).—  378 
438 In this letter Marx continues to set forth for his associates in America certain 
propositions of the economic theory he was then elaborating (see Note 45). At 
the time of writing this letter Marx had received from Cluss his article 'Das 
"beste Blatt der Union" und seine "besten Männer" und Nationalökonomen' 
published in the New York workers' newspaper Die Reform in September 1853, 
for which Cluss had made use of Marx's earlier letters. (For the text of this 
article and its analysis see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 623-32.) The question of 
rent was among the problems raised in the article. These notes by Marx are 
directly related to this subject and to the critique he began earlier of the 
American vulgar economist H. Ch. Carey.—378, 387 
439 Presumably Marx continued this letter the next day, 6 October  1853.—  383 
440 On Tuesday, 18 October 1853, Marx dispatched to New York 'The Turkish 
Manifesto.— France's Economic Position'. Engels may have taken part in writing 
it.— 388 
441 This letter was known earlier only from a copy of it in Cluss' letter to 
Weydemeyer of 2 November 1853 and partly as rendered by Cluss in his letter 
to Weydemeyer of 4 November 1853. The extract published in Marx and 
Engels, Works, Second Russian Edition, Vol. 28, and Marx und Engels, Werke, 
Bd. 28, included part of Cluss' text by mistake (the last paragraph).—390 
442 As the editors did not regularly send copies of the New-York Daily Tribune to 
him, Marx asked Cluss and Weydemeyer to send him the issues containing his 
articles. Cluss was compelled to copy out the article 'Revolution in China and in 
Europe' because he could not buy the newspaper in time. 
Marx's letter (presumably of August 1853) containing a request for this 
article has not been found.— 390

published in Die Reform.— 390 
444 The Turko-Egyptian fleet was destroyed by combined Russian, English and 
French squadrons at Navarino (Greece) on 20 October  1827.—  394 
445 In October 1853 Weydemeyer became editor-in-chief of Die Reform. As Cluss 
wrote to Marx on 23-24 October 1853, Weydemeyer was compelled 'to write 
almost the whole newspaper  himself.  In view of this Cluss requested Marx to 
get his associates to contribute to the newspaper.—396 
446 Only an extract from this letter is extant as quoted by Cluss in his letter to 
Weydemeyer of 7 December 1853.—397

449 Here Marx replies to Cluss' letter of 23-24 October 1853 in which Cluss wrote 
about the difficulties he had encountered in publishing the translation of 
Marx's first article from Lord Palmerston (see Note 436) in Die Reform. The 
Tribune published Marx's work anonymously, as leading articles, so Die Reform 
prefaced its publication with an editorial note: 'The interest aroused by 
Palmerston's name at the present time has induced us to print this rendering

A few lines below Cluss writes: 'Marx added some notes on Urquhart because 
Jones,  in a paper I am to receive, characterises him in a tactless way as an ally 
of the Russians [Jones' article 'A Russian Movement in England', The People's 
Paper, No. 80, 12 November 1853], Marx writes [this letter is not extant] that 
he gave Jones a dressing down for this. I have made up a short article out of 
the "Urquhartiade" '. Marx's article, 'David Urquhart', was published by Cluss 
unsigned in Die Reform, No. 112, 19 December 1853 (see present edition, Vol. 
12).—398

486).—401 
454 On 23 November 1853 Engels wrote a special letter—a statement against 
Willich, which Marx included in The Knight of the Noble Consciousness (see

December 1853 and is not extant.—403 
458 A reference to the London Convention of 15 July 1840 on support for the 
Turkish Sultan against the Egyptian Pasha Mohammed Ali and to the London 
Convention of 13 July 1841 which laid down that in peacetime the Straits 
would be closed to warships of all powers.—404, 432 
459 Marx did not realise his plan to continue publishing the series of articles on 
Palmerston in the New-York Daily Tribune. The last article dispatched to New 
York and recorded in his notebook on 6 December 1853 was not published in 
that newspaper. In The People's Paper it appeared as the eighth in the series 
'Lord Palmerston' and ended with the words 'To be continued'.—404 
460 Marx agreed to J. C. Juta's proposal to contribute to the newspaper Zuid

463 iviarx  refers to Charles Dana's letter to Mrs Marx of 16 December 1853 in 
which he presumably wrote about Engels' article 'The War on the Danube' 
published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 16 December as a leader. A week 
earlier, on 7 December, Dana had published another article by Engels, 
'Progress of the Turkish War', also as a leader (see present edition, Vol. 
12).—407 
464 Dana wrote to Mrs Marx about this on 16 December 1853.—407 
465 About 16 December 1853 the London publisher Tucker published anonymous­
ly the pamphlet Palmerston and Russia in Tucker's Political Fly-Sheets, No. 1 (a 
reprint from the Glasgow Sentinel) (see Note 541). The pamphlet reproduced 
the article of the same title published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 4 
November 1853, the second in this newspaper's publication of Lord Palmerston. 
The second edition of Palmerston and Russia, referred to here, was issued 
with Marx's participation in early February 1854. Marx made some amend­
ments and additions on the basis of the People's Paper publication. On how the 
whole series of articles Lord Palmerston was written and published see this 
volume, Note 436, and present edition, Vol. 12.—408, 432 
466 Engels analysed the fighting between the Russians and the Turks at Oltenitza (4 
November 1853) and Citatea (6 January 1854) in 'The Progress of the Turkish 
War', 'The War on the Danube' and "The Last Battle in Europe' (see present 
edition, Vol. 12).—408 
467 At the battle of Sinope between Russian and Turkish naval squadrons on 30 
(18) November 1853, during the Crimean war, the Turks were defeated. 
After the battle of Sinope, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, British Ambassador 
to Constantinople, handed the Sultan a recommendation from the British 
Government to conclude a three months' armistice with Russia; at the same 
time he tried to get British squadrons sent immediately to the Black Sea. 
The Vienna Protocol was signed on 5 December 1853 at the conference of 
representatives of Britain, France, Prussia and Austria. In this Protocol, as in 
the subsequent Note of 12 December, the four powers offered to mediate in 
the conflict between Russia and Turkey. As a basis for negotiations they 
demanded the evacuation of Moldavia and Wallachia by the Russians, renewal 
of former treaties between Russia and Turkey, guarantee of Christians' rights 
by special firmans and a reform of the administrative system in Turkey. In a 
Note of 31 December 1853 the Turkish Government stated its conditions for 
peace negotiations with the powers mediating: ,1) the preservation and 
guarantee of Turkish territorial integrity; 2) Russian evacuation of the 
Danubian Principalities; 3) renewal and observance of the London Convention 
of 1841 (see Note 458); 4) respect of the Sultan's sovereignty. These conditions 
were approved by a new Vienna conference of the ambassadors on 13 January 
1854 and forwarded to the Russian Government. However, Russia refused to 
accept the mediation of the powers and agreed to direct negotiations with 
Turkey. The participants in the Vienna conference rejected Russia's pro­
posals.—408 
468 A reference to Palmerston's short resignation of his post as Home Secretary 
(16-24 December 1853). His resignation was not accepted, however (on this see

European peoples against its rule waged up to 1814.—409 
472 Engels' letter to Steffen has not been found.—409 
473 when Engels was in London (see Note 461) he presumably discussed with 
Marx his plan to write such a work for the English Press. This plan did not

474 Neither Marx's note to Wilhelm  Wolff,  nor Wolff's letter to Marx has been 
found.—410 
475 The reference is to the Turkish Government's Note of 31 December 1853 (see 
Note 467).—410 
476 By the original (first) Vienna Note Marx means the draft agreement between 
Russia and Turkey drawn up by the Austrian Prime Minister Buol and adopted 
at the conference of the French, British and Prussian Ambassadors in Vienna 
at the end of July 1853. It obliged the Sultan to observe the terms of the 
Kuchuk-Kainardji (1774) and the Adrianople (1829) treaties on the rights and 
privileges of the Orthodox Church in the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish 
Sultan Abdul Mejid agreed to sign the Note but demanded a number of 
changes and reservations which the Russian Government found unacceptable.— 
410 
477 Marx alludes ironically to the leading article in The Times of 20 January 1854 
which stated in particular: 'Nevertheless, to all these considerations the 
Emperor Nicholas opposes a proud intractable temper, heightened, perhaps, by 
the religious enthusiasm or hereditary excitability of his family, and stimulated 
by the enthusiasm of his people, which is mixed with a barbarous contempt for 
nations whose power they cannot compare with their own.'—410 
478 Marx refers to the speeches made by Cobden and Bright at the Manchester 
Reform meeting on 24 January 1854 and reported in The Times, No. 21647, 25 
January. The speeches, dealing mainly with the foreign policy problems, were 
analysed in Marx's and Engels' article 'Fortification of Constantinople.— 
Denmark's Neutrality.—Composition of British Parliament.—Crop Failure in 
Europe' (see present edition, Vol. 12).—411 
479 Cluss' letter to Marx has not been found.—411 
480 Here Marx writes about issue No. 11 in Tucker's Political Fly-Sheets series being 
prepared for publication on the basis of Marx's Lord Palmerston (see Note 465). 
The pamphlet was printed in February-March 1854 anonymously and entitled 
Palmerston, What Has He Done? It reproduced with slight amendments the text 
of the fourth (except the first four paragraphs) and the fifth articles of the 
People's Paper publication.—412 
481 This offer was made by Dana in a letter to Mrs Marx of 16 December 1853. 
These plans did not materialise.—412 
482 The reference is to the second edition of the pamphlet Palmerston and Russia in 
Tucker's Political Fly-Sheets series (see Note 465). In subsequent editions of this 
series this work was entitled Palmerston and Poland.—412

646 Notes 
483 Marx has in mind the articles from his Lord Palmerston published in Die Reform 
in Cluss' translation. They corresponded to the second and third articles 
('Palmerston and Russia' and 'A Chapter of Modern History') in the New-York 
Daily Tribune and the fourth in The People's Paper (see Note 436).—412 
484 Marx wrote about this meeting also in a letter to Ferdinand Lassalle of 1 June 
1854 (see this volume, p. 455). 
Marx described Urquhart in his article 'David Urquhart' published in Die 
Reform on 19 December 1853 (see present edition, Vol. 12).—412 
485 In a letter to Nicholas I of 29 January 1854, Napoleon III proposed as a 
condition of preserving peace that Russia should withdraw her troops from the 
Danubian Principalities. On 14 February 1854 the letter was published officially 
in Le Moniteur universel, No. 45. Nicholas I's reply, containing a refusal to 
accept Napoleon Ill's proposal, was sent off on 9 February 1854 and published 
in Le Moniteur universel, No. 64, 5 March 1854.—414 
486 In a letter to Marx of 27 March 1854 J. J. H. Smuts, editor of The Zuid 
Afrikaan, refused to accept any further contributions from Marx, for, he wrote, 
'the amount of remuneration claimed by [Marx] for such correspondence, 
entirely exceeds the means which my establishment allows me to apply to such 
a purpose'.—414 
487 At Marx's request Engels wrote on 13 March 'Retreat of the Russians from 
Kalafat' (see present edition, Vol. 13). 
The Greek revolution—the revolt of the Greek population in Epirus, the 
mountain regions of Thessaly and other territories still subject to Turkey; Marx 
assessed these events in the article 'The Greek Insurrection' (see present 
edition, Vol. 13).—414, 444 
488 Marx has in mind Lassalle's letter of 10 February 1854. Engels' letter to Marx 
mentioned here has not been found.—417 
489 In 1853, with the growth of a massive strike movement of the British 
proletariat, a group of Chartists headed by Ernest Jones proposed to create a 
broad workers' organisation, The Mass Movement, which was to unite trade 
unions and unorganised workers with the primary aim of coordinating strikes 
in the various districts of the country. The organisation was to be headed by a 
regularly convened Labour Parliament consisting of delegates elected at 
meetings of both unorganised workers and of the trade unions associated with 
The Mass Movement. The Labour Parliament assembled in Manchester on 6 
March 1854 and was in session till 18 March 1854. It discussed and adopted 
the programme of The Mass Movement and set up an Executive of five 
members. Marx, elected honorary delegate to the Parliament, sent a letter to it 
(see present edition, Vol. 13), in which he formulated the primary task of the 
British labour movement—the necessity to create an independent proletarian 
mass political party. Marx regarded the convocation of the Labour Parliament 
as an effort to free the labour movement in Britain from narrow trade union 
limitations. 
The attempt to found The Mass Movement failed because the majority of 
the trade union leaders did not approve of associating the trade unions with 
the political struggle and did not support the idea of creating a single mass 
workers' organisation. By the summer of 1854 the strike movement had abated 
and this also cut short the participation of broad masses of workers in the 
movement. After March 1854 the Labour Parliament never met again.

496 Engels sent his manuscript 'The Fortress of Kronstadt' to The Daily News on 30 
March with a letter in which he offered to contribute to this newspaper as a 
military observer (see this volume, pp. 423-26). 
'The Fortress of Kronstadt' was not published during Engels' lifetime; in 
the present edition it is included in Vol. 13.—420, 422 
497 Marx refers to Lassalle's letter of 7 March 1854 (on it see this volume, p. 419). 
On Palmerston Lassalle wrote in particular: 
'True,  Palmerston never deserved—not by a long shot—the totally usurped 
reputation which he enjoys, and has lately been even more primitive than 
before; but neither is he a Russian agent, at least not consciously. His attitude I 
can best describe to you in the words he said to a friend of his as early as 
December: Je veux la Russie, je ne dis pas ruiner, mais lui donner un soufflet pour 
toute sa vie! [I want—I don't say to destroy Russia—but to give it a slap in the 
face that it would remember for ever!] 
'It is a fact that he pressed for war from December, etc., and answered 
every objection that Russia could not concede this or that with "Tant mieux!" 
["All the better!"]? (F. Lassalle. Nachgelassene Briefe und Schriften herausgegeben 
von Gustav Mayer. Band III. Der Briefwechsel zwischen Lassalle und Marx.

Petersburg, Hamilton Seymour, and the British Foreign Secretary Russell, 
concerning the negotiations between Seymour and Nicholas I on the Turkish 
question at the beginning of 1853. This correspondence and other documents 
pertaining to the pre-history of the Crimean War were published as a Blue 
Book, Correspondence Respecting the Rights and Privileges of the Latin and Greek 
Churches in Turkey. Presented to Both Houses of Parliament by Command of 
Her Majesty. Parts V, VI, London, 1854. Marx gave a detailed analysis of these 
documents in 'The Documents on the Partition of Turkey' and 'The Secret 
Diplomatic Correspondence' (see present edition, Vol. 13).—422 
499 Marx's letter to the editors of the New-York Daily Tribune of 27 March has not

1 On the outbreak of the Crimean War Engels offered his services as military 
observer to The Daily News and sent the editors his article 'The Fortress of 
Kronstadt' (see Note 496) on 30 March, and after 3 April 1854, at the request 
of the editors, the article 'The Russian Army', which was to open a series of 
articles on the Russian army and navy. The article was set and Engels probably 
received the proofs on 12 April 1854, with a letter from the editor 
H. J. Lincoln, who asked Engels about his terms. Engels pinned great hopes on 
this collaboration, believing that permanent work on the newspaper would 
enable him to give up his commercial activity and move to London. However, 
as can be seen from Engels' letter to Marx of 20 April 1854, Lincoln cancelled 
the previous contract when he discovered Engels' political views. Some of the 
propositions formulated in the article 'The Russian Army' were elaborated in 
'The Military Power of Russia' (see present edition, Vol. 13) and 'The Armies 
of Europe' (see present edition, Vol. 14) published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune and Putnam's Monthly.—423 
12 John Watts consented to recommend Engels as chief military correspondent to 
The Daily News in his letter to Engels of 27 March 1854.—424

Parliament' (see present edition, Vol. 13).—427

' This refers to the stand taken by Palmerston as Foreign Secretary on the

considered a free city. In Parliament and the press Palmerston passed himself 
off as 'a friend of Poland' but in fact betrayed its interests when in 1840 the 
population of Cracow protested against the unlawful occupation of that city by 
Austrian troops since February 1836 and when in November 1846, after the 
suppression of the national liberation uprising in Cracow, Austria, Prussia and 
Russia signed an agreement on the annexation of Cracow to the Austrian 
Empire. Marx exposed Palmerston's actions in his pamphlet Lord Palmerston 
(see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 358-70).—430, 432

1853 in connection with this work are extant.—432

The Unkiar-Skelessi treaty of defensive alliance was concluded by Russia and 
Turkey on 8 July (26 June) 1833. It provided for mutual aid in the event of 
war with a third power. A secret article of the treaty freed Turkey from the 
obligation to give military aid to Russia in return for an undertaking to close 
the Straits to all foreign men-of-war on Russia's demand.—432, 456 
The First Anglo-Afghan war (1838-42) was launched by Britain with the aim of 
colonising Afghanistan but ended in Britain's defeat.—432 
In 1838 the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies granted a French company a 
concession to extract sulphur in Sicily. In April 1840 the British Government, 
referring to the treaty of 1816 which forbade Naples to grant other countries 
commercial privileges infringing British interests, ordered its Mediterranean 
fleet to open hostilities and compelled Naples to cancel its agreement with the 
French company.—432 
Marx refers to the attitude of the Whig Government, in which Palmerston held 
the post of Foreign Secretary, towards Italy and Hungary during the 1848-49 
revolution.—432 
A reference to Cluss' letter to Marx of 4 April 1854.—433 
The report of Gorchakov, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army on the 
Danube, to Nicholas I was reprinted by The Times on 19 April 1854 from a 
special supplement to the Journal de Saint-Pétersbourg of 6 April 1854 and 
entitled 'The Russian Passage of the Danube'. The same issue of The -Times 
carried an item 'The Russian Fleet in the Black Sea' reprinted from Pyccniü 
uneajiud?) (and not from Cleepnan nuena as Marx wrote) about military 
operations on the Caucasian coast.—433

been found.—435 
A reference to Pieper's letter to Engels of 12 April 1854.—435 
The reference is to Herzen's address 'The Free Russian Community to the 
Russian Soldiers in Poland' printed in the Free Russian Press in London about 
25 March 1854 in connection with the outbreak of the Crimean War. Herzen 
called upon the Russian soldiers 'not to use arms against Poland'. The address 
was immediately reprinted by a number of English, French, Italian and Polish 
newspapers, The Daily News (No. 2471, 21 April 1854) among them.—437 
This letter of Marx has not been found.—439 
An allusion to Marx's articles on India ('The British Rule in India', 'The East 
India Company.— Its History and Results' and others—see present edition, 
Vol. 12) written in 1853, when the British Parliament debated the prolongation 
of the Fast India Company Charter.—439 
Engels' letter to Cluss has not been found.—441 
Kossuth, jointly with Mazzini and Ledru-Rollin, criticised the US Senate in the 
press refusing to prolong George Sanders' powers as Consul in London. This 
American public figure and journalist maintained contacts with petty-bourgeois 
emigrants in London. The American newspapers, The New-York Herald and 
The New-York Times in particular, attacked Kossuth for his criticism and 
accused him of meddling in US domestic affairs. Clippings from the American 
newspapers were sent to Marx by Cluss in his letter of 4 April 1854. Marx 
forwarded them to Engels probably in his letter of 22 April.—441

624 Weydemeyer, editor of Die Reform, received a review of Schimmelpfennig's 
book The War Between Turkey and Russia written jointly by Engels and Heise, 
when the newspaper ceased publication (Weydemeyer to Engels, 16 May 1854). 
He sent it on to Cluss who wanted to insert it in some other newspaper, 
preferably Der Deutsch-Amerikaner, a weekly published from March 1854 in 
Chicago by Eduard Schläger (Cluss to Marx, 25 May 1854). The editors of the 
present edition have no file of Der Deutsch-Amerikaner for that period and the 
fate of the review is unknown.—443 
525 An allusion to Schimmelpfennig's proposal to contribute military articles to Die 
Reform. In a letter to Marx of 13 April 1854 Cluss asked for Marx's advice on 
this point.—444 
526 The reference is to a number of reforms carried out in the Ottoman Empire in 
the spheres of finance, the army, administration and legislation (known as 
tanzimat) between 1839 and the early 1870s. Their practical implementation 
met with fierce resistance on the part of feudal reaction, particularly at the first 
stage, prior to the Sultan's new rescript (hatti-humayouni) in 1856.—444 
527 Odessa was bombarded by a united Anglo-French squadron on 22 April 1854. 
For details see Marx's 'The Bombardment of Odessa.—Greece.— Proclamation 
of Prince Daniel of Montenegro.—Manteuffel's Speech', present edition, Vol. 
13.—444, 446, 452 
528 Marx refers to the notice published by the Russian Ministry of Finance in a 
special supplement to KoMMepnemaa zaiema, Nos. 40 and 41, 6 (18) and 8 (20) 
April 1854 and reprinted in the Journal de Saint-Pétersbourg, No. 377, 8 (20) 
April 1854. Marx apparently used a report reprinted in The Times, No. 21726, 
27 April 1854, from the Journal de Saint-Pétersbourg.— 446 
529 In 1838 and 1839 the great powers held negotiations to regulate relations 
between the Netherlands and Belgium which had seceded from the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands as a result of the 1830 revolution. Previously England 
supported Belgium, jointly with France, but this time it sided with Russia, 
Austria and Prussia who sought to impose on Belgium the peace terms worked 
out by the great powers. France found itself isolated and was compelled to 
agree to these terms. Louis Philippe's diplomatic defeat was regarded in France 
as a serious foreign policy humiliation. 
In 1839, when the Turkish-Egyptian conflict over Syria, which had been 
occupied by the Egyptians in 1833, flared up anew, and France supported the 
Egyptian Pasha Mohammed Ali, Britain, seeking to prevent a growth of French 
influence in that area, brought diplomatic pressure to bear on France. On 15 
July 1840 a convention was signed in London by Britain, Russia, Prussia, 
Austria and Turkey promising to support the Sultan of Turkey (see Note 458). 
Louis Philippe, fearing a conflict with this coalition, made a new concession and 
refused any further support to Egypt.—447 
530 Mar x's conspectus of H. H. Parish's Diplomatic History of the Monarchy of  Greece 
(London, 1838) made early in May 1854 when he was studying the history of 
Greece is extant.—447

have used a reprint of this material in L'Indépendance belge, No. 123, 3 May 
1854.—447

533 Engels lived in Berlin as an army volunteer from September 1841 to about late 
September 1842.—449 
534 Here Marx has in mind the patrons of Stehely's confectionery in Berlin in the 
1840s, radical-minded men of letters, students and members of 'The Free' (see 
Note 535).—449 
535 'The Free'—a group of Berlin Young Hegelians which came into being in the 
first half of 1842. Among its principal members were Bruno Bauer, Edgar 
Bauer, Edward Meyen, Ludwig Buhl and Max Stirner. The system existing in 
the country was criticised by 'The Free' in an abstract manner, their statements 
were devoid of real revolutionary content, their ultra-radical form often 
compromised the democratic movement. Many of 'The Free' renounced 
radicalism in the following years. 
For a criticism of 'The Free' see K. Marx and F. Engels, The Holy Family, or 
Critique of Critical Criticism (present edition, Vol. 4).—449 
536 xhe information on Wiss given in the previous letter was passed on to Cluss by 
Marx in a letter written probably in the first week of May 1854. Marx's letter 
has not been found.—450 
537 Engels' irony is directed at Willich, who in his article 'Doctor Karl Marx und 
seine "Enthüllungen"' (Belletristisches Journal und New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung, 
No. 33, 28 October 1853) wrote that Schramm's second Miskowsky vanished 
without trace after the duel between Schramm and Willich (see Note 
360).—451 
538 In a letter of 30 April 1854 Cluss informed Marx, among other things, that Die 
Reform ceased publication.—453 
539 This is Marx's reply to Lassalle's letter of 20 May 1854 in which the latter asked 
for information on the plans of the political emigrants in England in 
connection with the Crimean War and also for Marx's articles on Palmerston 
which had been published in London as a separate pamphlet (see notes 465 
and 480).—454 
540 Marx's letters to Lassalle written in the second half of 1854 have not been 
found.—454 
541 A series of twelve pamphlets under the general title Tucker's Political Fly-Sheets 
was published in London by Urquhart's follower Tucker in 1853 and 1854, 
exposing Palmerston's foreign policy. The first two issues reproduced some 
sections of Marx's Lord Palmerston (see notes 465 and 480). In 1855 Tucker 
reprinted the series in one volume.—455, 472 
542 On 8 May 1852 Russia, Austria, Britain, France, Prussia, Sweden and Denmark 
signed the London Protocol on the integrity of the Danish monarchy, 
confirming the indivisibility of the Danish Crown lands, including the Duchy of 
Schleswig-Holstein. Among the legitimate claimants to the Danish Crown the 
London Protocol mentioned the Russian Emperor (as a descendant of Duke 
Charles Peter Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp who reigned in Russia as Peter III). 
He waived his rights in favour of Duke Christian of Glücksburg who was 
proclaimed successor to King Frederick VII. The London Protocol thus created

a precedent for the Russian Tsar to claim the Danish Crown in the event of the 
Glücksburg dynasty dying out.—456 
543 The Quadruple Alliance was concluded in April 1834 between Britain, France, 
Spain and Portugal. Even at the time the treaty was concluded, conflicts of 
interests appeared between Britain and Prance which later aggravated relations 
between the two countries. This treaty was formally directed against the 
absolutist 'Northern Powers' (Russia, Prussia and Austria), but in actual fact 
allowed Britain to strengthen her position in Spain and Portugal under the 
pretext of rendering military assistance to both governments in their struggle 
against the pretenders to the throne, Don Carlos in Spain and Dom Miguel in 
Portugal.—456 
544 A reference to the London conventions of 1840 and 1841 (see Note 458).—457 
54s Giovane Italia (Young Italy)—a secret organisation of Italian bourgeois 
revolutionaries founded by Mazzini. It existed in 1831-34 and 1839-48, its aim 
being struggle for the independence and unity of Italy.—458 
546 Engels apparently refers to Napier's report published in The Times, No. 21758, 
3 June 1854. It described the action between an English frigate and steamer 
and three Russian merchant ships near the fortress of Gustavsvaern on 23 May. 
Two Russian ships were sunk, the third captured. The report called this 'a very 
gallant feat of arms'.—460 
547 In June 1854 Engels simultaneously made notes from A. Görgei, Mein Leben 
und Wirken in Ungarn in den Jahren 1848 und 1849 (Bd. I-II, Leipzig, 1852) and 
from F. Hellwald von Heller, Der Winter-Feldzug 1848-1849 in Ungarn (Wien, 
1851) written on Windischgrätz's instructions.—460 
548 Engels refers to military reports of the Austrian Command published in the 
official Wiener Zeitung and also in Der Lloyd,  Österreichischer Correspondent, Die 
Presse and other Austrian newspapers, mostly over Windischgrätz's signature. 
Engels used them as his main source when writing articles for the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung on the course of the 1848-49 revolutionary war in Hungary 
against the Austrian monarchy (see present edition, vols. 8 and 9).—460

military operations at Silistria, was added by the editors to Marx's article

According to The, Times, the aim of the latter was to establish contact with the 
Circassian leaders (primarily with Shamyl) for a joint attack on the Russian 
towns of Sandjak and Anapa. This aim was attained. 
For an appraisal of these events see Engels' 'The War' and Marx's and

557 Marx refers to the fourth bourgeois revolution in Spain (1854-56) which began 
with a pronunciamento in Madrid on 28 June 1854. Marx analysed the 
revolutionary events in Spain in several articles written in 1854 (see present 
edition, Vol. 13).—469 
558 Engels complied with Marx's request and sent (by Tuesday, 1 August) material 
for their joint article 'That Bore of a War' (see present edition, Vol. 13).—472 
559 At the evening sitting of the House of Commons on 24 July 1854 the leader of 
the House, John Russell, announced that Sevastopol had been destroyed and 
captured by the Anglo-French squadron. However, replying to a question by 
Disraeli, leader of the Tory opposition, he was compelled to take his words 
back. The false claim of the capture of Sevastopol by the Allies was deleted 
from the text of Russell's speech published in The Times. 
At the sitting of 25 July 1854 Sidney Herbert, Secretary at War, gave 
reasons for the unsatisfactory food supply of the British expeditionary army 
and fleet and did his best to justify the Cabinet and War Administration. The 
speeches of Russell, Disraeli and Herbert were published in The Times, Nos. 
21802 and 21803, 25 and 26 July 1854. Marx attended the debates on the war 
in the House of Commons on 24 and 25 July and described them in detail in 
'The War Debates in Parliament' and 'The Policy of Austria.—The War 
Debates in the House of Commons' (see present edition, Vol. 13).—472

561 The federal J){et—the central organ of the German Confederation formed in 
1815.  It met in Frankfurt am Main and consisted of representatives of the 
German states. The Federal Diet was a vehicle of the German governments' 
reactionary policy. It ceased to exist during the 1848-49 revolution, was 
restored in 1851, and existed till 1866.—475 
562 This is presumably an allusion to the Mainz Central Investigation Commission 
instituted by decision of the Conference of German states in Karlsbad in 1819 
for an investigation into the 'tricks of the demagogues' (see notes 139 and 307), 
i.e. for the struggle against the opposition movement in the German

supported the emperors. The two parties existed till the fifteenth century.—

565 -phe reference is to Marx's part of the article sent to the New-York Daily 
Tribune on 29 August 1854. The article was tampered with by the editors, who 
published the part concerning Bomarsund (written by Engels) as a leader in 
issue No. 4182 for 13 September 1854. A few sentences from Marx's text were 
included in the news review in the same number. News about Kars, mentioned 
by Marx here, was included as a separate paragraph in Pulszky's article also 
published in that number (see present edition, Vol. 13, Note 293).—480 
566 In connection with the bourgeois revolution which started in Spain in 1854 (see 
Note 557), Marx made a thorough study of the history of the nineteenth-
century Spanish revolutions. The result was a series of articles, Revolutionary 
Spain, written between August and November 1854 (see present edition, Vol.

America on 30 September 1854. The Tribune editors published it as two

579 By 'Baron Nicholson's court' Marx means a club—the Judge and Jury 
Society—formed by Renton Nicholson in London in 1841. Its visitors staged

582 In 1763, the English journalist John Wilkes criticised King George Ill's Speech 
from the Throne in his newspaper The North Briton. He was expelled from the 
House of Commons and outlawed. After his forced flight to France, Wilkes 
returned to England in 1768, was elected to Parliament four times but each 
time his election was declared invalid. He was not admitted to Parliament until 
his fifth election. 
In connection with 'Wilkes' case' letters published in the London newspaper 
The Public Advertiser from 1768 to 1772 and signed Junius became very 
popular. The author campaigned for Wilkes' rehabilitation and for démocrat­
isation of the political system in Britain. In 1772 Junius' letters were published 
as a book. It was established later that they had been written by the journalist 
Philip Francis.—489 
583 In February 1792 the coalition of European feudal and absolutist states 
launched a war against revolutionary France. Britain supported this coalition 
and after France had been proclaimed a republic on 10 August 1792 and King 
Louis XVI executed in January 1793, it openly entered the war on the side of 
the coalition in early 1793.—489 
584 The suggestion that Robert Adair, British diplomat and Fox's confidential 
agent, was sent to St. Petersburg with the aim of upsetting William Pitt's plans 
was made by G. Tomline in Memoirs of the Life of the Right Honorable William 
Pitt, in 3 Volumes, London, 1821.—489 
585 In 1756, at the beginning of the Seven Years' War, Admiral Byng was ordered 
to lead a squadron to the Mediterranean. The squadron was defeated at the 
battle of the Minorca on 20 May 1756. The government placed the entire 
responsibility for this on the admiral, who was brought to England under 
arrest, sentenced to death and shot in March 1757.—490

October to December 1822. It decided in favour of French armed intervention 
against revolutionary Spain and continuance of Austria's occupation of the 
Kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia, and condemned the national liberation 
uprisings of the Greek people against the Turkish yoke.—492

592 The Bidassoa—a river in the Western Pyrenees on the border between France 
and Spain. The allusion is to the Peace of the Pyrenees concluded by France 
and Spain on Faisans Island on the Bidassoa on 7 November 1659 which 
helped France seize supremacy in Western Europe from Spain.—494

Bourbons, et de la nécessité de se rallier à nos princes légitimes pour le bonheur de la 
France et celui de l'Europe published in 1814. 
The Spanish branch of the Bourbon dynasty succeeded to the Spanish 
throne in accordance with the will of the childless Habsburg, King Charles II, 
in favour of the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV and great-great-
grandson of Henry IV, who became King Philip V of Spain in 1700.—497

published his three-volume Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem in 1811.—497 
897 In a letter of 1 November 1854 Charles Dana proposed that Marx should use 
for his military articles The War with Mexico by R. S. Ripley, a book on the 
operations of the American army in the war against Mexico in 1846-48. Dana 
wrote: 'This will gratify the national amour propre of our readers, and convince

Marx contributed to the Neu« Oder-Zeitung during 1855, writing his first article 
for it on 29 December 1854. Marx's articles were published unsigned, but 
marked 'x\ As there was practically no workers' press during the years of 
reaction, Marx's contributing to the Neue Oder-Zeitung made it possible to 
maintain contact with Germany and keep German readers informed on the 
vital problems of international and domestic politics, the working-class and 
democratic movement, and economic development in the capitalist countries, 
primarily Britain and France. Marx regularly sent articles on the operations in 
the Crimean War, and made frequent use of entire reports by Engels for the 
New-York Daily Tribune, translating them into German; he also sent the Neu« 
Oder-Zeitung abridged versions of Engels' articles, with occasional changes and 
additions. Articles from the Neue Oder-Zeitung are published in vols. 13 and 14 
of the present edition.— 502 
The reference is to the Welcome and Protest Committee formed by the 
Chartists, headed by Jones, for Barbes' expected arrival in Britain after he was 
amnestied, and against Napoleon Ill's intended visit. Barbes was released from 
prison on Napoleon Ill's order of 3 October 1854 in acknowledgment of the 
chauvinist stand he took when the Crimean War broke out. Marx and Engels 
censured Barbes' behaviour in the article 'The Sevastopol Hoax.—General 
News'  written on 5-6 October 1854: 'From this moment Barbes has ceased to be 
one of the revolutionary chiefs of France' (see present edition, Vol. 13, p. 491). 
On 18 October 1854 the emigrant L'Homme. Journal de la démocratie universelle, 
published in London, carried Barbes' letter of 11 October in which he 
confirmed his attitude to the war but at the same time declared his hostility to 
the Bonapartist regime. This statement, however, did not save his political 
reputation and shortly afterwards he gave up politics.— 502 
At one of the meetings held by the Welcome and Protest Committee in London 
on 26 and 28 November 1854 Jones said among other things that 'the 
democracy of Britain did not own the word foreigner—it looked on the exiles 
not as Frenchmen, or Italians, but as men, as brothers... At the same time, it 
desired to give the forthcoming demonstration a truly national and English 
character. If exiles were on the committee, it might be said exiles have got up 
the affair, and that it was not a genuine manifestation of British feeling. 
Therefore the committee would number only British names though it hoped to 
gather round itself hearts from every land' (The People's Paper, No. 135, 2 
December 1854).—503 
Marx has in mind the national liberation war in Spain against the Napoleonic 
rule (1808-14).—504 
The reference is to the last, the third unpublished article of Marx's series 
Revolutionary Spain, sent to New York on 8 December 1854. The manuscript

Marx carried out his plans in the article 'Progress of the War' which he wrote 
jointly with Engels on 14-15 December 1854.—505 
Engels planned to write a critique of pan-Slavist ideas. Ever since his removal to 
Manchester in 1850 Engels had been studying the language, literature and

history of the Slav peoples. As can be judged from Marx' letters to Engels of 16 
May and 26 June 1855, Marx negotiated the publication of Engels' pamphlet in 
Germany (see this volume, pp. 535 and 539). But these plans of Marx and 
Engels remained unfulfilled. 
In April 1855 at Marx's request Engels wrote two articles on this subject 
under the title 'Germany and Pan-Slavism' (see present edition, Vol. 14, pp. 
156-62). They were published in the Neue Oder-Zeitung and under changed 
titles in the New-York Daily Tribune (see Note  649).—  505,  534, 535, 539 
0 Engels spent Christmas in London. Engels' letter written on about 15 December 
1854 has not been found.— 505 
1 Marx refers to the trial of the French Blanquist worker Emmanuel Barthélémy, 
accused of murdering two Englishmen. The English Press made a great fuss 
over the trial, which did not succeed in clearing up the motives behind the 
murder. Barthélémy was sentenced to death and executed on 22 January 
1855.—505 
2 In compliance with this plan Marx wrote two articles, on 29 December 1854 
and 1 January 1855, which were published in the Neue Oder-Zeitung on 2 and 4 
January 1855 under the general title 'Rückblicke' ('In Retrospect'). This marked 
the beginning of Marx's collaboration with this newspaper (see Note 603).—507 
3 Thé formation of a Foreign Legion for the purpose of reinforcing the British 
in the Crimea was envisaged by the Enlistment of Foreigners Bill passed in 
Parliament on 22 December 1854. The Legion was not formed however owing 
to protests against the use of foreign mercenaries.—508, 520

F. Engels, Literature and Art. Selections from Their Writings, N. Y., 1947, 
p. 106.—508 
15 Marx and Heine met and became friends in Paris at the end of December 
1843.  Marx supported Heine in his disputes with the radical petty-bourgeois 
opposition who attacked Heine for his criticism of Ludwig Börne, one of their 
prominent representatives.—509 
6 In reply to attacks in the Allgemeine Zeitung in April 1848 Heine stated in the 
supplement to No. 144 of the same paper, on 23 May 1848, that he was 
compelled to accept the pension his French friends (the historian Mignet, in 
particular) succeeded in obtaining for him as he was in great straits owing to 
the prohibition of his books in Germany.—510 
17 In a letter of 7 January 1855 Lassalle asked Marx to list the works containing 
official statistical data on the changes in England's economic position after the 
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 (see Note 72).—511 
18 Marx has in mind his economic notes made from September 1850 to August 
1853,  when he resumed his economic research (see Note  45).—511,  522 
19 In January 1854 Marx wrote the following articles for the Neue Oder-Zeitung: 
'The Opening of Parliament' (on the 24th), 'Comments on the Cabinet Crisis' 
(on the 26th) and 'Parliamentary News' (on the 27th). At Marx's request Engels 
wrote for the New-York Daily Tribune the article 'The European War' (about 29 
January) (see present edition, Vol.  13).—  514

0 The reference is to the Aberdeen Coalition Government (see Note 343) which 
was defeated in the House of Commons on 29 January. On the basis of the 
material mentioned here and sent by Marx to Engels with his next letter of 31 
January 1855, Engels wrote the article 'The Late British Government' for the 
New-York Daily Tribune on 1 February 1855. The same subject was used by 
Marx in the articles 'The Defeated Government' and 'Two Crises' for the Neue 
Oder-Zeitung in early February 1855 (see present edition, Vol. 13).—515 
1 In April 1853 and from March to May 1854 Marx devoted several articles to 
Gladstone's financial policy. They were published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune, the Neue Oder-Zeitung and The People's Paper. The most detailed 
analysis of Gladstone's budget is given in 'The New Financial Juggle; or 
Gladstone and the Pennies', 'Achievements of the Ministry', 'L. S. D., or Class 
Budgets, and Who's Relieved by Them', 'Riot at Constantinople.—German 
Table Moving.—The Budget' (see present edition, Vol. 12), 'British Finances.— 
The Troubles at Preston', 'British Finances' and others (Vol. 13). It has not 
been established which articles Marx sent to Engels. —515 
2 The Irish Brigade—the Irish faction in the British Parliament from the 1830s to 
the 1850s. With the equilibrium existing between the Tories and the Whigs, the 
Irish Brigade, alongside the Manchester men (see Note 63), could influence the 
alignment of forces in Parliament and sometimes decide the fate of the 
government.— 516 
3 The reference is to the Franchise Bill. As early as February 1852 Russell made 
a preliminary statement of his intention to introduce it (see his speech in the 
House of Commons on 9 February 1852, The Times, No. 21034, 10 February 
1852);  however, it was never debated in Parliament.— 516 
4 Marx refers to the 'Removal of Some Disabilities of Her Majesty's Jewish 
Subjects' Bill, introduced by Russell in the House of Commons on 24 February 
and aimed at admitting Jews to the House. Russell's Bill passed the House of 
Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords. Marx assessed it in the 
article 'Parliamentary Debates.—The Clergy Against Socialism.— Starvation' 
(see present edition, Vol.  11).—  516 
15 At the sitting of the House of Commons on 31 May 1853 Russell stated that the 
British Parliament should not sanction a state subsidy to the Catholic Church in 
Ireland because the Catholic clergy were not sufficiently committed to the 
English Crown and the Constitution. Russell's speech was published in The 
Times, No. 21443, 1 June 1853.—516 
6 These Bills were introduced in Parliament in November 1852. Marx analysed 
and assessed them in the articles 'The Indian Question.—Irish Tenant Right' 
(see present edition, Vol. 12) and 'From the Houses of Parliament.—Bulwers' 
Motion.—The Irish Question' (Vol. 14).—517 
7 The Transportation Bill, which abolished deportation of criminals to penal 
colonies, was passed on 12 August 1853. After preliminary detention the 
transportées were given release certificates granting them the right to reside in 
Britain under police surveillance, employed as cheap labour for public works. 
Marx assessed this Bill in 'The War Question.— British Population and Trade 
Returns.—Doings of Parliament' (see present edition, Vol.  12).—  518 
8 Marx refers to the proposals on the public debt moved by Gladstone in the 
House of Commons on 8 April 1853. For details see Marx's articles 'The New 
Financial Juggle; or Gladstone and the Pennies', 'Achievements of the Ministry',

'Affairs in Holland.—Denmark.—Conversion of the British Debt.— India, 
Turkey and Russia', 'The Russian Humbug.—Gladstone's Failure.—Sir Charles 
Wood's East Indian Reforms' (present edition, Vol. 12). 
At the sitting of the House of Commons on 28 July 1853 Gladstone moved 
a resolution on measures for creating a public consolidated fund to pay for 
shares of the South Sea Company, which in fact meant the failure of the plan 
for conversion of the public debt (see K. Marx, 'Financial Failure of 
Government.—Cabs.— Ireland.—The Russian Question', present edition, Vol. 
12).—518

The reference is to the article 'On the History of the Eastern Question' 
published in the Journal de Saint-Pétersbourg, No. 336, 18 February (2 March) 
1854 in connection with John Russell's speech in the House of Commons on 17 
February 1854. The article alluded to the collusion of the Russian and British 
governments in the Turkish question supporting its statement by reference to 
Seymour's secret correspondence in 1853 and the memorandum of 1844. Marx 
analysed the position adopted by the two powers in the articles 'The Documents 
on the Partition of Turkey' and 'The Secret Diplomatic Correspondence' (see 
present edition, Vol.  13).—  519 
Under a law in force in England since 1662 paupers who changed their place 
of residence or applied to a parish for alms could be returned to their former 
place of residence by court decision. On 10 February 1854 a Settlement and 
Removal Bill was introduced in the House of Commons envisaging prohibition 
of forced settlement of paupers in England and Wales. The Bill was^rejected by 
Parliament.—520 
Under a law in force in England since the early eighteenth century newly 
elected MPs were to take an 'oath of abdication' denying the right of any heirs 
of James II to the throne; the oath contained expressions of loyalty to 
Christianity. Refusal to take the oath deprived an MP of the right of active 
participation in the work of Parliament.— 520 
Engels' article 'The Late British Government' (see present edition, Vol. 13 and 
also Note 620).—520 
The reference is to Ferdinand Lassalle's letter to Marx of 27 January 
containing cuttings from the January issues of the Düsseldorfer Zeitung and the 
Kölnische Zeitung, and Roland Daniels' letter of 16 January  1855.—  521 
Marx writes about the traditional banquets of petty-bourgeois emigrants held to 
mark the anniversary of the February 1848 revolution in France.—521 
A reference to the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 
24).—521 
A reference to the International Committee set up by representatives of the 
London Chartist Organising Committee (as the Welcome and Protest Commit­

Polish, Hungarian, Italian and other petty-bourgeois refugees. Jones was its 
President. At the end of 1855 the International Committee became an

independent organisation; renamed the International Association in 1856, it 
operated until  1859.—  521 
639 Judging by extant documents, Herzen did not attend the meeting, but received 
a written invitation to become a member of the International Committee (see 
Note 638).—521 
640 An allusion to Herzen's view of 'old Europe' and 'young Russia' expounded 
most clearly in Du développement des idées révolutionnaires en Russie, par 
A. Iscander, Paris, 1851; La Russie et la vieux Monde. Lettres à W. Linton. Esq., 
par A. Herzen; Le peuple russe et le socialisme. Lettre à Monsieur J. Michelet, 
professeur au Collège de France, par A. Herzen. Seconde édition, 1855, and other 
works. These publications were used by Marx and Engels. — 523 
641 This may be a reference to Herzen's reply to Ivan Golovin's slanderous article 
(see this volume, pp. 523-24): 'Reply to Mr. Golovin. To the Editor of The 
Morning Advertiser', published in The Morning Advertiser on 15 February 
1855.—525 
642 Marx refers to the anonymous pamphlet De la conduite de la guerre d'Orient. 
Expédition de Crimée. Mémoire adressé au gouvernement de S. M. l'Empereur 
Napoléon III par un officier général, Bruxelles, 1855. Its authorship was ascribed 
to several persons, Prince Napoleon (Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte) among 
them. Marx assessed it in the articles 'On the History of the French Alliance' 
and 'The Brussels Mémoire' and Engels in 'Fate of the Great Adventurer' (see 
present edition, Vol.  14).—  526 
643 In January and February 1855 Marx read B. G. Niebuhr's The History of Rome, 
a new edition in three volumes, London,  1847-51,  and simultaneously made a 
summary of it entitled 'Römische Geschichte'.— 527 
644 Badinguet—a nickname given to Napoleon III because in 1846 he escaped 
from prison in the clothes of the mason Badinguet. In April 1855 Napoleon III 
made an official visit to England.— 534 
645 Marx and his wife returned to London from Manchester about 6 May 
1855.—535 
646 In 1854, in connection with the Crimean War and the exacerbation of the 
Eastern Question, Bruno Bauer published several pamphlets, among them De 
la dictature occidentale, Die jetzige Stellung Rußlands and Rußland und das 
Germanenthum. It has not been established which of these is referred to 
here.—  535 
647 Marx may have had in mind his letter to Eisner of 17 April 1855, but he could 
have written to him after his return from Manchester, i.e. after 6 May 
1855.—535 
648 Marx has in mind the supporters of the Administrative Reform Association set 
up in May 1855 on the initiative of liberal circles in the City. Taking advantage 
of the alarm in the country caused by the plight of the British army in the 
Crimea, the Association hoped by means of mass rallies and with the Chartists' 
support to bring pressure to bear on Parliament and win broader access to 
government posts for members of the commercial and finance bourgeoisie. The 
Association failed in its strivings and soon ceased to exist. Marx repeatedly 
wrote about the Association's activity and its relations with the Chartists; see for 
instance his article 'The Agitation Outside Parliament' (present edition, Vol. 
14).—536

662 Notes 
649 Marx considered it essential to publish a critique of pan-Slavist theories in the 
New-York Daily Tribune in order to counteract the influence exerted on 
American public by the articles and pamphlets of a pan-Slavist contributor to 
the newspaper, A. Gurowski. The New-York Daily Tribune published after 
heavy editing Engels' two articles on pan-Slavism (see Note 609) under the titles 
'The European Struggle' and 'Austria's Weakness' on 5 and 7 May 1855 
respectively (see present edition, Vol. 14).—536 
650 Dana's letter to Marx of 1 June  1855.—  537 
651 Engels wrote the survey 'The Armies of Europe' (see present edition, Vol. 14) 
from June to September 1855. He was helped in this work by Marx, who 
collected material for him on various European armies, the Spanish and the 
Neapolitan in particular, at the British Museum library. The survey was 
published unsigned in Putnam's Monthly in August, September and De­
cember.—537, 540 
652 On 29 June Engels wrote 'From Sevastopol' (see present edition, Vol. 14) about 
the Allies' unsuccessful storm of Sevastopol on 18(6) June 1855—the fortieth 
anniversary of Waterloo. The main French attack was directed against 
Malakhov Hill and the English against the Redan (Third Bastion).—538 
653 In a letter of 13 August 1855 which has not survived, Engels asked Weerth, 
then in Hamburg, to negotiate with Duncker about his, Engels', pamphlet on 
pan-Slavism (see Note 609). As emerges from Weerth's reply to Engels of 24 
August, his negotiations with Duncker failed.—539 
654 A mass demonstration organised by the Chartists was held in Hyde Park on 24 
June 1855, in protest against a series of anti-popular measures adopted by 
Parliament (in particular, the prohibition of Sunday trading). Marx took part in 
this demonstration with other German revolutionary democrats and described it 
in 'Anti-Church Movement.—Demonstration in Hyde Park' (see present 
edition, Vol. 14).—539 
655 Marx has in mind the police reprisals against the participants in the second 
mass demonstration held, despite the police prohibition, in Hyde Park on 
Sunday, 1 July 1855, in protest against Sunday Trading Bill (on the first 
demonstration see Note 654). Marx describes the events in which he took part 
in 'Agitation over the Tightening-up of Sunday Observance' (see present 
edition, Vol. 14).—541 
656 A law prohibiting the sale of spirits had been in force in the State of Maine 
since 1851. 
Know-nothings—a secret political organisation formed in the USA in 1854 
against emigrants; the members of this organisation swore to answer 'I know 
nothing' to all questions about its activity and aims.—542 
657 A reference to Szeredy's letter to Marx of 15 July 1855 containing a request for 
assistance in publishing and distributing his novel Asiatic Chiefs in Britain and 
the USA.—543 
658 Marx made this request because he intended to write the pamphlet Lord John 
Russell (see present edition, Vol. 14).—543 
659 Marx's pamphlet Lord John Russell was published in the New-York Daily Tribune 
on 28 August 1855 condensed into a single article. The pamphlet was 
published in full in German in the Neue Oder-Zeitung as a series of six articles

adressé au gouvernement de S. M. l'Empereur Napoléon III sur l'expédition de Crimée 
et la conduite de la guerre d'Orient, par un officier général, Genève, mai 1855—was 
ascribed to the French journalist Tavernier and the Belgian officer, adjutant of 
the War Minister, T. F. Sterckx. Like the first Mémoire it was aimed at 
justifying the actions of the French Command in the Crimean campaign.— 545 
661 Marx's letter to Dana has not been found.— 546 
662 On 15 June 1855 Charles Napier published in The Morning Advertiser his 
letters criticising the administrative system in the British Navy, the lack of talent 
among commanders, and in particular the criminal irresponsibility of James 
Graham, First Lord of the Admiralty, which came to light during the military 
operations of the Anglo-French fleet in the Baltic Sea in 1854 and 1855. The 
Times published Napier's article on 24 August 1855. Marx wrote about 
Napier's letters and his correspondence with Graham in the articles 'Napier's 
Letters.—Roebuck's Committee', 'Napier's Letter' and 'Another British Revela­
tion' (see present edition, Vol. 14).—546 
663 The information Marx had access to was presumably unreliable. It has not been 
established what newspaper he meant. Herzen met Engländer in 1849, but he 
already knew at that time that he was an agent of the French and Austrian 
police and would have nothing to do with him.—548, 553 
664 Here Marx compares his enforced departure for Manchester (see Marx to 
Moritz Eisner, 11 September 1855, this volume, pp. 550-53) with the evacuation 
of the Southern Side of Sevastopol by the Russian troops on 28-29 August (8-9 
September) 1855.—550 
665 This is Marx's reply to Eisner, who wrote in his letter of 4 September 1855 
about the financial straits of the Neue Oder-Zeitung to which Marx contributed 
during that year (see notes 603 and 612).—550 
666 Eisner's letters of 3 and 7 October 1855 to Marx.—554 
667 The reference is to two Prussian Constitutions. The first was imposed by King 
Frederick William IV simultaneously with the dissolution of the Prussian 
National Assembly on 5 December 1848. It introduced a two-chamber system. 
The King retained the right not only to rescind the Chambers' decisions but 
also to revise certain articles of the Constitution. The further strengthening of 
the reaction led in April 1849 to the dissolution of the Second Chamber elected 
on the basis of the 1848 Constitution, to the replacement of universal suffrage 
with a three-class electoral system based on a high property qualification and to 
the introduction of a new, still more reactionary Constitution which came into 
force on 31 January 1850.—554 
668 On 10 October 1855 L'Homme, the French refugee newspaper printed in 
Jersey, carried an open letter by a leader of petty-bourgeois democratic 
emigrants, Felix Pyat, to Queen Victoria in connection with her visit to France 
in August of that year. Anti-Bonapartist in content, this letter was provocative 
and adventuristic like all Pyat's utterances. It caused a polemic in the English 
and emigrant press, and serious fears that the so-called Aliens Bill might again 
come into force (see Note 75). To curry favour with Napoleon III the

the demand of the Prussian Government, he was expelled from France and 
compelled to move to Brussels.—556 
671 An allusion to Georg Weerth's former activity as a journalist. During the 
1848-49 revolution he wrote essays and feuilletons (in verse and prose) for the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung. —556 
672 Marx's letter to Jones has not been found.— 557 
673 The reference is to a book by Herzen which came out in London in early 
October 1855. It included the second and fourth parts of My Past and Thoughts 
and was entitled My Exile in Siberia (two volumes, London, 1855). The title was 
supplied by the publishers, Hurst and Blackett, and on about 17 October 
Herzen lodged a protest with them against the arbitrary change of the title. 
Reviews published in The Leader, (No. 290, 13 October), Critic, London Literary 
Journal (No. 25537, 15 October), Atlas (20 October), Athenaeum (No. 1460, 20 
October), The Economist (10 November) and other papers highly appraised 
Herzen's book.—558 
674 Engels' two articles for the New-York Daily Tribune were sent to the USA by the 
steamer Asia, which sailed from Liverpool and reached Halifax on 19 
December. The newspaper published the first article as a leader entitled 'The 
State of the War' on 21 December 1855 and the second also as a leader, 'The 
War in Asia', on 26 December 1855. Engels' authorship of these articles was 
established during the preparation of this volume.— 559 
675 In his letter of 20 November 1855 Dana informed Marx that the Tribune 
editors had agreed to publish two articles by Marx every week and to pay him 
10 dollars for each.—559, 560 
676 Judging by Dana's letter (see Note 675) Marx proposed to organise the dispatch 
of articles to the New-York Daily Tribune directly from the Crimea probably 
expecting that the German emigrant O. Mirbach, a former Prussian artillery 
officer who intended to leave for Constantinople, would be the correspond­
ent.— 560 
677 The article written by Engels on 12 December 1855 and edited by Marx was 
sent to the USA by the steamer Pacific on 16 December and published in the 
New-York Daily Tribune on 29 December 1855 under the title 'The Asiatic 
Campaign'. Marx's and Engels' authorship of this article was established during 
the preparation of this volume.— 561 
A nickname given to Bruno Bauer by Marx and Engels in the first half of the 
1840s. The Young Hegelians called their own trend 'critical criticism'. See Marx 
and Engels, The Holy Family, or Critique of Critical Criticism (present edition,

an additional material to expose the false nature of the whole trial.— 576 
687 Marx and Engels used addresses of several businessmen and trading houses for 
safe conveyance of the documents to the defence counsel at the Cologne 
Communist Trial, Schneider II, Esser I and von Hontheim. The list of these 
addresses is given in Vol. 11 of the present edition, pp.  590-91.  See also this 
volume, p. 218.—578 
688 -phe editors of the present edition do not have the original of this letter at their 
disposal and it is printed according to a copy in Cluss' letter to Weydemeyer of 
28 March 1853.—579 
689 An allusion to the fact that financial difficulties prevented Weydemeyer and 
Cluss from buying up from the printers all the copies of The Eighteenth 
Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte printed in New York.— 579 
690 Jenny Marx presumably refers to the unsuccessful attempt to publish Marx's 
and Engels' pamphlet The Great Men of the Exile.—580 
691 The American funds—money raised for the so-called German-American 
revolutionary loan (see Note 27).— 580 
692 -y/he excerpt from Cluss' letter to Weydemeyer given here expounds the 
contents of part of Marx's letter to Cluss, which has not survived. The letter 
was probably written on about 1 May 1853, when Marx was visiting 
Manchester.— 582 
693 The reference is to Cluss' letter to Marx of 10 April  1853.—  582 
694 Engels planned to publish Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany in 
German in Die Reform. The last, twentieth, article of this work did not appear 
in the New-York Daily Tribune and was probably not written (see Note 
214).—582 
695 The excerpt from Cluss' letter to Weydemeyer given here contains an account 
of Jenny Marx's letter to Cluss of 20 May 1853 which has not survived.— 583 
696 Marx visited Engels in Manchester from 30 April to 19 May  1853.—  583

666 Notes 
This excerpt from Cluss' letter to Weydemeyer gives the contents of part of 
Marx's letter to Cluss which has not survived. The letter may have been written 
in February 1853.—584 
Marx's letter to Cluss has not survived.—584 
Jenny Marx presumably asks Engels to return Marx's letter to Jacob Schabelitz 
which she mentions here. The letter, which has not been found, was written at 
the end of November 1852. In his reply to Marx of 1 December Schabelitz 
agreed to accept Marx's terms for the publication of the pamphlet Revelations 
Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne.—585 
The circumstances of the duel between Schramm and Willich referred to here 
were distorted by the latter in the slanderous article 'Doctor Karl Marx und 
seine "Enthüllungen"'. Miskowsky was Schramm's second (see present edition, 
Vol. 12, pp. 494-95, and also Note 360).—586 
Karl and Jenny Marx' letter to Cluss has not survived.—587 
Probably a slip of the pen. The meetings of Polish refugees were held on 28 
and 29 November 1853 (see Note 456)^—587
