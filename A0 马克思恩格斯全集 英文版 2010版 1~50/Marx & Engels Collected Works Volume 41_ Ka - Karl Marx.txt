Preface 
Volume 41 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels contains 
their letters to each other and to third persons from January 1860 
to September 1864. This material provides an irreplaceable insight 
into their life and work, enabling us to follow the composition of 
their writings, and to build up a picture of their practical 
revolutionary activities. 
This period saw the continuous rise of the bourgeois democratic 
and national liberation movements which had been growing in 
Europe and America ever since the world economic crisis of 1857. 
The rapid development of capitalism in Britain, France, Germany 
and some other European countries accelerated the liquidation of 
the political and social survivals of feudalism. In Germany and 
Italy, where the bourgeois revolution had not yet been completed, 
the movement for national unification once more got into its 
stride. In Russia, even after the abolition of serfdom in February 
1861,  peasant disturbances continued, and revolutionary tenden­
cies were growing among the progressive intelligentsia. In 1863, a 
national liberation uprising began in Poland. In the USA, the Civil 
War was being fought between the capitalist North and the 
slave-owning South. There was growing opposition in France to 
the Bonaparte regime. The struggle of the oppressed peoples 
under the Austrian monarchy was gathering momentum. In 
Mexico, the bourgeois revolution triumphed. 
As a result of the industrial revolution, serious changes were 
taking place in the proletariat's numerical strength, composition 
and class consciousness. In 1859-60 the London building workers' 
strike, which had repercussions far beyond Britain, vividly 
demonstrated the irreconcilability of proletarian and bourgeois class 
interests. The working-class movement had set out on a 
course of independent struggle, which testified to its gradual eman­
cipation from the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie. In 
the first half of the 1860s, these processes became manifest, in 
England, with the further growth of trade-unionism and the 
workers' awakening to political activity; in France, with the 
growing class awareness of the proletariat; in Germany, with the

establishment of the General Association of German Workers 
(1863).  In addition, there was the active participation by workers 
of various nationalities in the revolutionary struggle for freedom 
and democracy in the American Civil War and in Garibaldi's 
detachments in Italy. The realisation by progressive workers that 
their interests ran counter to those of the ruling classes, the 
increased feeling of class solidarity and the strengthening of 
international contacts led to the foundation, on 28 September 
1864,  of the International Working Men's Association (the First 
International). 
In 1860-64, Marx and Engels regarded as the main task the 
further elaboration of economic theory, which was of crucial 
importance for the development of the working-class revolutionary 
movement. They were also close followers of current events, which 
they analysed in their articles for progressive bourgeois newspa­
pers.  The rise of the working-class and democratic movement 
highlighted the need for establishing a proletarian party and 
promoting international contacts between proletarian rev­
olutionaries. 
Marx considered it his principal duty to write an economic 
work which would arm the proletariat with a knowledge of the 
laws of capitalist society's development and would provide 
economic proof of the historical necessity for a proletarian 
revolution. On 15 September 1860, he wrote to Lassalle that his 
work had an 'expressly revolutionary function' (p. 193). In June 
1859,  the first instalment of A Contribution to the Critique of Political 
Economy was published (see present edition, Vol. 29). Early in 
1860,  Marx began preparing the second instalment which, in his 
own words, was to contain the 'quintessence' of his economic theory 
(p- 12). 
Marx wanted to finish this work as soon as possible. Engels, too, 
considered the early appearance of Marx's work 'of paramount 
importance' (p. 14). However, Marx interrupted his work in 
order to publish a repudiation of the libellous attacks on him 
made by Karl Vogt. Not until a year and a half later, at the beginning 
of June 1861, was he able to resume his economic studies (p. 292). 
True,  they were often interrupted subsequently because of recurring 
material difficulties and ill health (see, e.g., pp. 353 and 435). 
Moreover, Marx was constantly widening the scope of his study, 
perfecting its structure and developing its propositions. Although 
Marx worked hard and with the utmost dedication, the project, 
which was to be his masterpiece, Capital, stretched out over many-
years.

Preface XXI 
Marx's and Engels' letters make it possible to follow the 
different stages in the writing of Capital and to see how, in the 
process of preparing the second instalment of A Contribution to the 
Critique of Political Economy, Marx exceeded the original planned 
limits of the manuscript so that by the summer of 1863 he had 
written a far bigger second rough draft of the future work (the 
first version of Capital was the manuscript of 1857-58; see present 
edition, Vols. 28 and 29). The manuscript of 1861-63, which 
Marx called A Contribution to the Critique of Political  Economy,  consists 
of 23 notebooks (present edition, Vols. 30-34). The problems 
of the future Volume I of Capital are here worked out in 
detail, and some important propositions in Volumes II and 
III are expounded. The greater part of the manuscript is 
taken up by a historical-critical section (Theories of Surplus 
Value). 
In a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann of 28 December 1862, Marx 
mentions for the first time his intention of calling his work Capital 
and of using the original title, A Contribution  to the Critique of Political 
Economy, solely as a subtitle. He decided to use the manuscript of 
1861-63 for a book which was to deal with 'capital in general' 
(p. 435). Its new structure had, in the main, taken shape by January 
1863.  In a letter to Engels of 29 May 1863, he wrote that he intended 
to 'make a fair  copy  of the political economy for the printers (and give 
it a final polish)' (p. 474). Evaluating his own work, Marx noted in a 
letter to Engels dated 15 August 1863 that he had 'had to demolish 
everything and even build up the historical section out of what was in 
part quite unknown material' (p. 488). 
Late in July or in August 1863, the work on Capital entered a 
new stage.. Marx revised the manuscript of 1861-63, the result of 
which was the third rough draft of the theoretical part of Capital, 
consisting of three books (the manuscripts of 1863-65). He worked 
on the first book (the future Volume I of Capital) until the 
summer of 1864. 
The letters reflect the titanic work done by Marx in those years: 
the study and analysis of a mass of factual material (official 
reports, press publications), and the critical interpretation of works 
by the classic bourgeois political economists and by representatives 
of vulgar political economy. In his letter to Lassalle of 16 June 
1862,  Marx attacks the eclecticism of the German vulgar economist 
Roscher, who 'merely goes snuffling round amidst the wealth of set 
answers ... always with an eye to the prejudices and the interests of his 
paymasters' (p. 379). 
Not only do the letters illustrate the various stages of Marx's

XXII Preface 
work on Capital; they also contain some of the conclusions at 
which he was arriving in the course of his research. Thus, in his 
letters to Engels of 2 and 9 August 1862, he outlines 'a lengthy 
and complex affair' (p. 394)—the formation, as the result of 
competition and the flow of capital from one branch to another, 
of the average rate of profit, and the proof of the possibility of 
absolute ground rent 'without infringing the law of value' (p. 403). 
He also indicates the practical revolutionary significance of this 
problem for substantiating the need to abolish private landed 
property from the viewpoint of the proletariat's interests (p. 398). 
Lenin commented that these letters give 'a remarkably popular, 
concise, and clear exposition of the theory of the average rate of 
profit on capital and of absolute ground rent' (V. I. Lenin, 
Collected Works, Vol. 21, p. 68). 
In a letter to Engels of 28 January 1863, Marx mentions the 
'considerable controversy' about the way in which the machine 
differs from the tool (p. 449), gives a brief historical outline of the 
growth of machine production and, finally, formulates the concept 
of the industrial revolution: 'The industrial revolution,' he writes, 
'began as soon as mechanical means were employed in fields 
where, from time immemorial, the final result had called for 
human labour..., where, by the nature of things and from the 
outset, man has not functioned purely as power' (p. 451). 
Worthy of special attention is the letter from Marx to Engels of 
6 July 1863. In it, Marx formulates the basic theses of his theory 
of social reproduction, which he also presents in the form of an 
economic table (pp. 490-91). This analysis of the reproduction and 
circulation of the aggregate social capital was to be expounded later 
in detail and at a higher theoretical level in Section III of the second 
volume of Capital. 
Marx carried on his economic studies in close and fruitful 
contact with his friend Engels. He not only obtained from him 
data on the organisation of production, but also kept him advised 
of the progress he was making in his research and consulted him 
on many important matters. 'Can't you come down for a few 
days?'  he wrote to Engels on 20 August 1862. 'In my critique I 
have demolished so much of the old stuff that there are a number 
of points I should like to consult you about before I proceed' 
(p. 411). 
The letters in the present volume bear evidence to the 
encyclopaedic knowledge of Marx and Engels and the vast scope 
and diversity of their scientific interests. They enthusiastically 
welcomed Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, published in

Preface XXIII 
1859.  Both Marx and Engels valued it highly as a work that 
affirmed the idea of development in nature, refuted the idealistic 
interpretation of its laws, and bore out materialist dialectics. In 
1863-64, Marx and Engels read and exchanged views on books by 
Sir Charles Lyell, Thomas Henry Huxley, Perceval Barton Lord, 
Theodor Schwann, Mathias Jakob Schleiden and others. Marx was 
also studying mathematics with a view to substantiating differential 
and integral calculus in terms of dialectics. 
A number of letters testify to the interest taken by Marx and 
Engels in ancient history, the history of religion, and law. Marx 
read in the original Greek, 'for recreation', Appian on the civil 
wars in Rome. Appian attracted him because 'he probes the 
material basis' of those wars (p. 265). Marx liked the way Appian 
described his favourite hero, Spartacus, as a 'great general..., of 
noble character'. Marx's letters to Lassalle of 11 June and 22 July 
1861,  and Engels' letter to Marx of 2 December 1861 contain a 
critique of Lassalle's work, Das System der erworbenen Rechte. In this 
connection Marx and Engels discussed Roman law, particularly its 
application in West European countries, and raised the general 
philosophical problem of the relationship between form and 
content (p. 318); Criticising Lassalle's idealistic approach to the legal 
categories, his faith 'in the "idea of law", absolute law' (p. 330), they 
demonstrated that the law is conditioned by the production and 
property relations (pp. 294, 317-18). 
As before, Engels pursued his special interest in languages (he 
had resumed his studies of Russian and Serbian), and in the 
theory and history of the art of war. The letters reflect the wide 
range of military problems with which he concerned himself at the 
time.  Engels analysed, from the standpoint of historical material­
ism, the military aspects of current international affairs (with 
special reference to the US Civil War), and also wrote about his 
articles for newspapers and The New American Cyclopaedia. 
The letters of Marx and Engels from 1860 to 1864 give a 
detailed picture of their work as journalists. They continued 
contributing, until March 1862, to the progressive American 
newspaper, the New-York Daily Tribune, of which Marx was an 
official correspondent for eleven years. At the beginning of the 
1860s, it spoke for the Republican party and actively opposed slavery 
in America. Although nominally only Marx was correspondent for 
the Tribune, he continued writing for it in collaboration with 
Engels. Engels also contributed to The Volunteer Journal, for 
Lancashire and Cheshire and to the Allgemeine Militär-Zeitung in 
Darmstadt.

XXIV Preface 
In May 1861, Marx was invited to write for the liberal Viennese 
newspaper Die Presse, which was popular not only in Austria, but 
also in Germany. Marx set great store by the opportunity to 
publish articles in the European periodical press. He accepted the 
offer of Die Presse and began, in October 1861, sending articles to 
Vienna; however, for political reasons the editors did not always 
publish them. 'The rotten Presse is printing barely half my articles,' 
he wrote to Engels on 27 December 1861. In December 
1862,  Marx had to give up contributing to this newspaper alto­
gether. 
The letters of Marx and Engels are an important supplement to 
their journalism, making it possible to reconstruct how the articles 
were written and how, by exchanging opinions, they arrived at a 
common view on various matters. The letters often contain more 
abrasive, emotional judgments on various personalities than the 
articles. They reflected the spontaneous reaction of Marx or 
Engels to this or that instance of personal behaviour and were not 
intended for publication. 
Marx and Engels gave much attention at the time to the national 
liberation movement in Italy. They followed in detail the heroic 
campaign of Garibaldi's 'Thousand' in Sicily and in South Italy in 
1860 and had a high opinion of his revolutionary tactics (p. 205). 
They identified themselves with the Italian people's revolutionary 
war, which was making possible the unification of the country by 
revolutionary means, and attributed an all-European significance 
to the Italian problem, as relevant to unmasking the true aims of 
Napoleon Ill's European policy—the exploitation of the national 
liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples in his own selfish 
interests. 'Garibaldi is a veritable godsend. Otherwise, Bonaparte 
would have been restored to popularity and sustained by the 
Russo-Prussian-Austrian Holy Alliance,' Marx wrote to Engels on 
15 September 1860. The leaders of the working class exposed the 
policy of the Piedmontese government of Cavour, who was trying 
to unite Italy under the aegis of the Savoy dynasty. This was 
objectively leading to the subordination of Italy to Bonapartist 
France. 'Cavour is actually Bonaparte's tool,' Marx wrote to 
Lassalle on 2 October 1860. Marx also noted the dangerous 
flagging of the revolutionary spirit jn Garibaldi's army (pp. 203-04), 
the causes of which he disclosed more fully in his articles on Italy (see 
present edition, Vol. 19). 
Marx and Engels also regarded the problem of Germany's 
unification as closely connected with the revolutionary struggle of 
the Italian people. This struggle, in their opinion, was reducing

Preface XXV 
the threat to Germany from Bonapartist France (p. 132). Two 
factors, they believed, could create conditions for the unification 
of Germany by revolutionary-democratic means in the first half of 
the 1860s: first, the constitutional conflict that had developed in 
1860 between the Prussian government and the bourgeois liberal 
majority of the Diet (Landtag) over the problem of reorganising 
the Prussian army; second, the national liberation struggle of 
Schleswig and Holstein against Danish domination in 1863-64. His 
visit to Germany in 1861 convinced Marx of the growing mood of 
opposition, the revolutionary ferment and the disillusion of the 
German people with the 'new era' proclaimed by 'handsome William' 
(p. 312). 
Right up to the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian war in 1866, 
Marx and Engels retained their hopes of the country's unification 
by revolutionary-democratic means. They severely criticised the 
indecision and cowardice of the German liberal bourgeoisie and 
the reactionary policy of Bismarck, who was using the Danish War 
of 1864 as a first step on the road to the unification of Germany 
'from above' by 'iron and blood'. 
With unfailing attention, Marx and Engels followed the matur­
ing crisis in the social and political system of the Second Empire in 
France. They stressed in their letters that Napoleon III was 
seeking a way out of it in foreign policy adventures and trying to 
use in his own interests the aspirations of the Italian and German 
peoples for unification. They denounced the demagogic subter­
fuges to which he was resorting in order to camouflage his 
predatory policy. Bonaparte, wrote Marx on 29 March 1864 to 
Lion Philips, 'set his troupiers up in business as "freedom" 
exporters' (p. 513). In 1861, Britain, France and Spain launched 
their armed intervention in Mexico, where the bourgeois revolu­
tion had triumphed. On the part of Napoleon III, the Mexican 
expedition, openly colonial in character (pp. 349-50), was an attempt 
to strengthen his position by victories overseas (p. 453). Marx 
foresaw the inevitable failure of the expedition and the fall of 
Napoleon's empire. 'I myself am in no doubt,' he wrote to Engels on 
15 August 1863, 'that Mexico will be the hurdle at which he'll break 
his neck' (p. 489). Marx derided the Bonapartist methods of political 
demagogy, which, under conditions of colonial war, had assumed 
particularly grotesque forms. He also pointed out another danger of 
the British-French-Spanish intervention. Napoleon III and Palmer-
ston wanted to use Mexico as a base for intervention in the US Civil 
War on behalf of the slave-owning Confederacy (see, e.g., 
p. 489).

XXVI Preface 
One of the key issues in the correspondence between Marx and 
Engels during this period was the US Civil War. In their letters, as 
in their articles, they analysed its causes, disclosed its true nature 
and motive forces and pointed out its significance not only for the 
United States but for Europe. Marx and Engels were only able to 
throw light in the press on the early stage of the war, as their 
contributions to the New-York Daily Tribune and Die Presse ended 
in 1862. The letters are particularly valuable, since they inter­
preted the course of the Civil War from beginning to end. They 
furnish a methodological basis for studying the history of that war 
and many problems of the United States's subsequent development. 
The letters show that, even before the outbreak of the Civil 
War, Marx and Engels were following the growing antagonism 
between North and South closely, and were aware that a clash was 
unavoidable. They regarded it as a result of the irreconcilable 
struggle between two social systems, capitalist production develop­
ing in the North and the plantation system in the South, based on 
slave labour. The preservation of slavery was incompatible with 
the capitalist development of the country as a whole. The problem 
of whether the American farmers would be given access to land in 
the West, or if slavery would spread all over the States, was at the 
root of the Civil War. Realising that hostilities were already 
imminent, Engels wrote to Marx on 7 January 1861: 'The least 
irruption of irregulars from the North might result in a general 
conflagration. At all events, one way or another, slavery would 
appear to be rapidly nearing its end' (p. 242). 
Marx and Engels regarded the Civil War in the USA as a 
specific form of bourgeois-democratic revolution whose victory 
would open the way to the rapid development of capitalism in 
North America. They therefore vigorously supported the North, 
objectively the vehicle of social progress. They assessed the 
significance of the Civil War in the context of the overall outlook: 
for the revolutionary movement in Europe and America, consider­
ing that it could give a powerful stimulus to social struggle and the 
development of the working-class movement. 'The slavery crisis in 
the United States,' Marx wrote to Lassalle on 16 January 1861, 
even before the beginning of the war, 'will bring about a terrible 
crisis in England...; the Manchester cotton lords are already 
beginning to tremble' (p. 246). Later, in a letter to Engels of 
29 October 1862, Marx pointed out that events in America 'are such 
as to transform the world' (p. 421). 
As the letters show, Marx studied the history of the secession of 
the Southern states very carefully and revealed its true nature and 

=====第25页=====
Preface XXVII 
aims.  Drawing on American sources, he refuted the claims of the 
British bourgeois press about its 'peaceful nature'. He demon­
strated that secession was not an act of self-defence, but a 
predatory war for the expansion of slavery. For fifty years, the 
slave-owners had been waging a steady offensive struggle against 
the North. After the election of Abraham Lincoln as President in 
1860,  they went over to open military operations and on 12 April 
1861 unleashed a war against the Union. Marx described secession 
as 'usurpations without exception' by a handful of slave-owners, a 
policy that was at odds with the interests of the vast majority of 
the population even in the southern states and met the 'strongest 
opposition' there (pp. 301, 305-09). 
Marx, and especially Engels, followed the course of military 
operations in the USA. Engels summed up the major battles and 
analysed the strategy and tactics of the two sides (see Engels' 
letters to Marx of 12 June and 3 July 1861, 5 and 23 May and 
30 July 1862, 11 June 1863, 9 June and 4 September 1864 and many 
others). While noting the progressive nature of the war on the part 
of the Northerners, Marx and Engels severely criticised the methods 
of the Federal government, which was afraid to give the war a 
nationwide revolutionary character and proclaim the abolition of 
slavery. They also deplored the professional incompetence, indeci­
sion, cowardice and instances of outright treachery on the part of the 
Federal government ministers and generals in the army of the North 
who were associated, through material interests, with the 
slaveowners of the South (pp. 307, 386-87, 414 and others). 
Marx stressed in 1862 that 'the way in which the North is waging 
the war is none other than might be expected of a bourgeois 
republic, where humbug has reigned supreme for so long' 
(p. 416). 
The military failures of the North sometimes made Engels 
doubt the possibility of its winning, and he confided this to Marx 
(pp. 386-88, 414-15 and others). Marx pointed out in his replies that, 
in assessing the prospects of the war, consideration must be taken not 
only of the strength of the armies on both sides, but of the totality of 
economic, socio-political and military factors (pp. 400, 420-21). He 
wrote to Engels on 10 September 1862: 'It strikes me that you allow 
yourself to be influenced by the military aspect of things a little too 
much' (p. 416). 
In the letters of this period, the fundamental proposition of 
Marxist military science is developed: that the character of a war 
and the methods of its conduct are mutually determined. '...Unless 
the North instantly adopts a revolutionary stance, it will get the

terrible thrashing it deserves,' Engels wrote to Marx on 30 July 
1862.  Marx also emphasised that 'wars of this kind ought to be 
conducted along revolutionary lines, and the Yankees have so far 
been trying to conduct it along constitutional ones' (p. 400). He 
was certain that sooner or later the people would compel the 
government to change its mode of waging the war. 
Subsequent events confirmed Marx's predictions. In the middle 
of 1862, having realised the need for decisive action, Lincoln put 
through a series of revolutionary-democratic measures, the main 
ones being the emancipation of the slaves, and the Homestead 
Act, which gave great numbers of American farmers access to the 
land. These measures, described by Marx as of 'historical import' 
(p. 421), became a turning-point in the history of the Civil War 
and ensured the ultimate victory of the North. 'The fury with 
which the Southerners are greeting Lincoln's acts is proof of the 
importance of these measures,' Marx wrote to Engels on 29 October 
1862. 
As early as during the Civil War, Marx and Engels noted the 
socio-economic factors that favoured the preservation of racial 
discrimination and of national and social oppression in the USA 
after the Republicans' victory and the abolition of slavery. As 
fighters for the proletarian revolution, they denounced American 
bourgeois democracy, describing the USA as the 'arche­
type of democratic humbug' (p. 562). 'The people have been 
cheated,' wrote Engels, and the bourgeoisie is always ready to 
compromise with the slave-owners for the sake of 'the almighty 
dollar' (p. 457). The record of the Civil War bore out Marx's and 
Engels' conclusion that the bourgeois-democratic republic was only 
a stage on the road to proletarian revolution. As Engels wrote to 
Marx on 15 November 1862, '...the bourgeois republic should be 
utterly discredited..., so that ... it may never again be preached 
on its own merits, but only as a means towards, and a form of 
transition to social revolution' (p. 428). 
During the period in question, Marx and Engels were keeping a 
close watch on the revolutionary events in Russia and Poland. As 
can be seen from their letters, it was at this time that they began to 
regard a peasant revolution in Russia as a potential stimulus to 
proletarian revolution in Europe. They envisaged support for the 
general European revolutionary movement in the campaign for 
the abolition of serfdom in Russia which, in the late 1850s and 
early 1860s, had produced a revolutionary situation there. 'In my 
view,' Marx wrote to Engels on 11 January 1860, 'the most 
momentous thing happening in the world today is the slave

movement—on the one hand, in America, ... and in Russia, on the 
other... Thus, a "social" movement has been started both in the 
West and in the East. Together with the impending downbreak in 
Central Europe, this promises great things' (p. 4; see also 
p. 7). Even after the abolition of serfdom, Marx and Engels 
continued studying the unceasing actions of the peasants, robbed 
by the 1861 reform. 
Marx and Engels also discussed the implications of the peasant 
movement in Russia for the national liberation struggle in Poland, 
which they regarded as being of general European significance 
and which, given the favourable development of events, could 
become the starting-point of a revolution in Europe. They 
considered that an uprising in Poland could call forth mass 
peasant actions in Russia which, in their turn, would benefit the 
movement in Poland. An alliance of the Russian and Polish 
revolutionary movements could ensure the success of an uprising 
in Poland. On learning of the Polish insurrection, which began in 
January 1863, Marx wrote to Engels: 'What do you think of the 
Polish business? This much is certain, the era of revolution has 
now fairly opened in Europe once more... This time, let us hope, 
the lava will flow from East to West and not in the opposite 
direction...'- (p. 453). 
Marx and Engels also hoped that the Polish insurrection and the 
peasant revolution in Russia would lead to a revolutionary upsurge 
in Germany, and above all in Prussia, which was undergoing an 
acute political crisis. Deprived of support from Russian tsarism, 
the Prussian monarchy would lose its hegemony in Germany. 
Engels wrote to Marx on 17 February 1863: 'Monsieur Bismarck 
knows that it will be a matter of life and death for him if there's 
revolution in Poland and Russia' (p. 456). 
In view of the vast importance of this question for Germany's 
future, Marx and Engels felt something had to be done to 
stimulate democratic circles in Germany to take resolute action in 
defence of the insurgent Poles and oppose the internal reaction. 
With this aim in view, they decided, as early as in February 1863, 
to write a pamphlet, Germany and Poland (pp. 455, 457-59), in which 
they would trace, on the strength of concrete historical material, 
Prussia's predatory policy towards Poland and the rise of the 
Hohenzollern dynasty. The idea was to demonstrate the absolute 
incompatibility of Germany's interests with those of 'the Hohenzol-
lerns'  own state' (p. 462), i.e. of reactionary Prussia, which was the 
main obstacle to the unification of Germany by democratic means. 
Just as scathingly they denounced (also on the historical plane) the 

=====第28页=====
XXX Preface 
hypocritical policy of the British and French governments which, 
while posing as Poland's protectors, were pursuing their own selfish 
ends (see, for example, pp. 462-63). Marx and Engels also disclosed 
the treacherous role of the Polish nobility where their own people's 
interests were concerned (pp. 470-71). 
In analysing the motive forces of the insurrection and its 
prospects, Marx and Engels agreed that it could only succeed 
given the broad participation of the peasant masses (p. 483). They 
therefore attached special importance to the movement in 
Lithuania, where an active part was being played by the 
peasants—a movement which extended beyond the bounds of the 
Kingdom of Poland, to other provinces of the Russian empire 
(p. 464). However, as early as in the summer of 1863 it was clear 
that the chances of success were slight. The movement in Poland 
did not develop into an agrarian revolution, and the struggle of 
the peasants in Russia was by this time on the wane. The tsarist 
government not only quelled the Polish insurrection but used it as 
a pretext for suppressing the revolutionary movement at home, 
thereby slowing down its further development. 
The main cause of the insurrection's failure, Marx and Engels 
held, was that the leadership had been taken over by the 
bourgeois-landowner party of 'whites'. These were afraid to rely 
on the popular masses and placed all their hopes on support from 
the government of Napoleon III and Palmerston. Marx and 
Engels noted with alarm the growth of Bonapartist illusions 
among the Polish democrats. On 15 August 1863 Marx wrote to 
Engels: 'The Polish affair has gone completely off the rails because 
of ... Boustrapa [Napoleon III.—  Ed.],  and the influence his 
intrigues have given the Czartoryski party' (p. 489). The same 
social and political factors, in Engels' opinion, were behind the 
military failures of the insurgents. He also pointed out the weak 
sides of their military organisation—the lack of experienced 
commanders, the shortage of arms, and the low standard of 
leadership, which led to considerable losses at the very beginning 
of the uprising (pp. 461, 464, 466, 476, 483, 492). 
Marx and Engels endeavoured to give practical support to the 
Polish revolutionaries. They considered that sympathy for the 
Polish liberation movement among the workers and democratic 
circles in the West European countries should be used to organise 
aid to the insurgents, and to strengthen the internationalism of the 
workers of different countries. In their letters, Marx and Engels 
wrote with outrage of the 'foul conduct' of the Prussian 
government, which gave every possible assistance to Russian

tsarism in crushing the insurrection. They also denounced the 
treacherous behaviour of the German liberal bourgeoisie, which 
had become an accomplice of reaction. Marx wrote to Engels on 
7 June 1864 that the 'Prussian liberal press is too cowardly even so 
much as to remark on the continued surrender of Polish refugees by 
the Prussians' (p. 538). 
The late 1850s and early 1860s marked a new stage in the 
practical revolutionary activities of Marx and Engels, aimed at 
setting up a revolutionary proletarian party. They had no plan 
specifying the organisational forms of such a party as yet; the 
structure of the Communist League was ill-suited for the needs of 
a mass workers' movement. During this period, Marx and Engels 
were endeavouring to rally round them and educate the most 
advanced representatives of the proletariat, and to protect them 
from libel and harassment by class enemies. 
The letters show how determinedly Marx and Engels sought 
ways and means of influencing the working-class movement 
(pp. 9, 13-14, 261, 455 and others). They widened their personal ties 
with members of the working-class and democratic movements, 
resuming old contacts and getting to know representatives of the 
new generation of workers in Britain, Germany, Switzerland, 
France, Belgium and the USA. Their closest associates were their old 
comrades-in-arms, Johann Georg Eccarius, Wilhelm  Wolff,  Wil­
helm Liebknecht, Victor Schily, Wilhelm  Eichhoff,  Carl Pfänder 
and others, many of whom had been members of the Com­
munist League. In 1859, Marx rejoined the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London (p. 11); his lectures helped to 
imbue its members with a spirit of proletarian solidarity and 
taught them the rudiments of a revolutionary scientific world 
outlook. 
With great attention and hope, Marx and Engels followed the 
renewed political activity of the British proletariat. As a result of 
the blockade by the Northerners'- navy of the Southern ports in 
the USA, there was a 'cotton famine' in Europe, especially in 
Britain. Closely connected with this was a crisis in the British 
cotton industry, involving a sharp fall in production and a 
deterioration in the workers' condition. British government circles, 
which were planning armed intervention in the USA on the side 
of the rebels, tried to win the support of the masses by trading on 
the plight of the workers. The British proletariat, however, came 
out resolutely against the bourgeoisie's interventionist plans. Marx 
and Engels approved of the mass meetings held by workers in 
London, Manchester and other cities in 1862-63 to express their

XXXII Preface 
solidarity with the opponents of slavery in the USA (pp. 440, 468). 
On 26 March 1863, Marx attended one such meeting in St. James' 
Hall, and in his letter of 9 April 1863 to Engels he commented with 
satisfaction: 'The working men themselves spoke very well  indeed, 
without a trace of bourgeois rhetoric or the faintest attempt to 
conceal their opposition to the capitalists' (p. 468). These meetings 
did much towards educating English workers in the spirit of 
internationalism. At the same time, Marx and Engels noted the 
'sheeplike attitude' and 'servile Christian nature' of the majority of 
the workers in England. They considered freeing these workers 
from the influence of bourgeois ideology a primary task. Through 
the German Workers' Educational Society in London Marx 
established contacts with the English trades-union leaders who, in 
acknowledgment of his services to the working class, invited him as 
guest of honour to the inaugural meeting of the First Internation­
al on 28 September 1864. 
.Marx corresponded actively with his old colleague Joseph 
Weydemeyer, whom he called 'one of our best people' (p. 117). He 
helped Weydemeyer to organise Stimme des Volkes, the newspaper 
of the Chicago Workers' Society (pp. 115-19). Taking part in the 
campaign for the defence of Auguste Blanqui, who was in prison, 
Marx established 'direct links with the decidedly revolutionary party 
in France' (p. 298). Marx and Engels saw that in France, as in 
Britain, there was a noticeable growth of political activity by the 
working class, although its forces were still very weak (p. 477). 
Marx and Engels were also keeping a finger on the pulse of the 
working-class movement in Germany, drawing a great deal of 
information, in particular, from the letters of Wilhelm Liebknecht, 
who returned to his homeland in 1862. '...His continued sojourn 
in Berlin is most important to us,' Marx wrote to Engels on 7 June 
1864 (p. 537). Liebknecht's activities in the General Association of 
German Workers, guided by the advice and directions of Marx 
and Engels (pp. 537, 539), helped to disseminate the ideas of 
scientific communism among the German workers. The establish­
ment of direct contacts with them was of great importance. In June 
1864,  a number of their representatives came from Solingen to visit 
Marx in London. '...Now as ever,' he informed Engels after a talk 
with them, 'all were our resolute supporters' (p. 533). At the end of 
1862,  Marx began corresponding with Ludwig Kugelmann, a 
participant in the revolution of 1848-49, and with Johann Philipp 
Becker, an eminent leader of the democratic and working-class 
movement, whom he considered 'one of the noblest German 
revolutionaries' (p. 356).

Preface XXXIII 
A vital task in the efforts to form a proletarian party was the 
defence of the proletarian fighters, of the party 'in the broad 
historical sense' (p. 87) from calumny and attacks by the 
ideologists and agents of the bourgeoisie. In the late 1850s, the 
petty-bourgeois democrat Karl Vogt launched a smear campaign 
against Marx and his associates. In December 1859, he brought 
out a pamphlet, Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung, a piece 
'full of the most outrageous calumnies' (p. 23). He resorted to 
falsification of the facts and to barefaced lies to libel the 
Communist League, portraying its members as conspirators in 
secret contact with the police and accusing Marx of personal 
motives. The libel was taken up by the European bourgeois press 
and also by a number of German papers published in the USA. 
Marx's and Engels' letters in 1860 testify to their correct 
assessment of the 'Vogt's libellous work' (p. 56) as an attempt to 
discredit the nature and objectives of the battle being fought by the 
proletarian revolutionaries. Marx's steps against Vogt had 'nothing 
to do with private interests', he wrote to Ferdinand Freiligrath on 
23 February 1860. Vogt, he emphasised, was indiscriminately 
slinging mud at the party (pp. 56, 57). Under these conditions 
Marx and Engels considered a fitting rebuff to Vogt to be 'crucial 
to the historical vindication of the party and its subsequent 
position in Germany' (p. 54). The answer to his pamphlet 
was Marx's devastating exposé Herr Vogt (see present edition, 
Vol. 17). 
The correspondence enables us to trace step by step the 
different stages in the writing of this book. Marx spent nearly a 
year on Herr Vogt, interrupting his economic research and the 
work on Capital. To obtain the necessary information, he sent out 
a great many letters to friends, acquaintances and others who 
could help in unmasking Vogt. He also consulted his personal 
archives and studied a vast quantity of other material. Herr Vogt 
was written in close collaboration with Engels, who helped Marx at 
every stage of the work. The preparations for the writing and the 
book itself played an important part in rallying the proletarian 
revolutionaries, especially the German ones (in Germany and 
Switzerland) and in consolidating their prestige with the masses. 
When he began work on the pamphlet, Marx brought a lawsuit 
against the Berlin National-Zeitung, a bourgeois daily which in 
January 1860 had reproduced Vogt's vilest insinuations in two 
leading articles. Marx's aim in instituting the proceedings was the 
public unmasking of the libeller (pp. 21-22). However, as is clear 
from Marx s correspondence with Weber (his lawyer in Berlin) 
2—558 

=====第32页=====
XXXIV Preface 
and others, the suit was dismissed. Marx's complaint was 
successively rejected at four judicial levels on the pretext that 'no 
discernible public interest was involved'. In his letters, Marx 
revealed the class nature of the Prussian legal system and the true 
reasons why the Berlin courts had rejected his case. 'It is, of 
course, "an issue of public importance" to the Prussian govern­
ment that we should be traduced to the utmost,' he wrote 
sarcastically to Engels on 24 April 1860 (p. 129). 
Marx's Herr Vogt, which came out on 1 December 1860, 
denounced Vogt as a paid Bonapartist agent (p. 132) and gave a 
true picture of the views and activities of the proletarian 
revolutionaries. Engels greeted its appearance enthusiastically. 
'The thing's splendid,' he wrote to Marx on 3 December 1860 
(p. 222), and in his letter of 19 December, he described it as Marx's 
'best polemical work' (p. 231). 
The revolutionary theory of Marx and Engels affirmed its 
influence within the working-class movement in struggle against 
bourgeois ideology, reformism, opportunism and petty-bourgeois 
socialism. During the period covered by this volume, Marx and 
Engels considered that their main objective in this field was 
criticism of the reformist theory and opportunist tactics of 
Ferdinand Lassalle, . who claimed the role of organiser and 
theoretician of the working-class movement in Germany. Mean­
while, working out a truly scientific programme and tactics had 
become a matter of cardinal importance to the German working-
class movement in the early 1860s as it had grown numerically and 
adopted a course of independent political struggle, and needed, in 
particular, to define its position on the most urgent problem 
facing the country, that of unification. 
Marx and Engels took a positive view of Lassalle's efforts to free 
the German proletariat from the influence of the bourgeois Party 
of Progress and the cooperativistic ideas of Schulze-Delitzsch. It 
was his practical activity that they approved of. '...It's quite a 
good thing that an audience for anti-bourgeois stuff should be 
recaptured in this way,' Engels wrote to Marx on 20 May 1863 
(p. 473). The foundation in May 1863, with Lassalle's direct 
participation, of the General Association of German Workers 
initiated the recovery of the independent working-class movement 
in Germany. Marx and Engels saw this as a service by Lassalle. 
However, Lassalle's programme for the working-class movement 
encountered harsh criticism from Marx and Engels. In the 
summer of 1862, as a result of discussions with Lassalle in 
London, Marx became convinced that 'all we had in common 

=====第33页=====
Preface XXXV 
politically were a few remote objectives' (p. 400). He severely 
criticised 'An Open Reply to the Central Committee on the 
Convocation of the General German Workers' Congress in 
Leipzig', drawn up by Lassalle as a platform for the Association. 
Lassalle's programme created the illusion that it was possible to 
achieve socialism without a consistent revolutionary class struggle, 
by agitation for universal suffrage and by setting up production 
associations with state assistance. 'He solves the wages v. capital 
problem "with delightful ease",' wrote Marx ironically (p. 467). 
Marx and Engels stressed that Lassalle did not understand the 
true conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat as set forth 
and substantiated in their writings. On the subject of Lassalle's 
'Workers' Programme', Marx wrote to Engels on 28 January 1863: 
'...the thing's no more nor less than a badly done vulgarisation of 
the Manifesto and of other things we have advocated so often that 
they have already become to a certain extent commonplace' 
(p. 452). In their letters, Marx and Engels repeatedly criticised 
Lassalle for his distortion of the ideas he had borrowed from them, 
his 'historical and theoretical blunders' (p. 479), his boastfulness and 
petty conceit (see pp. 389, 390,  440-41,  488-89, 534). 
Marx and Engels were particularly worried by Lassalle's tactics. 
With the constitutional conflict deteriorating, Lassalle's attacks 
exclusively on the bourgeois-liberal Party of Progress were playing 
into the hands of reaction. Condemning this flirting with the 
government (Marx and Engels did not yet know of Lassalle's direct 
negotiations with Bismarck), Engels wrote to Marx on 11 June 
1863:  'The chap's now operating purely in the service of Bismarck' 
(p. 478). As early as in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848), 
Marx and Engels wrote that in fighting feudal reaction the German 
workers should seek an alliance with the bourgeoisie, 'whenever it 
acts in a revolutionary way'. They considered it necessary, 
however, to encourage among the workers 'the clearest possible 
recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and 
proletariat' (present edition, Vol. 6, p. 519). Lassalle 'could have 
found out perfectly well from the Manifesto what attitude one 
ought to adopt towards the bourgeoisie at times such as these', 
wrote Engels (p. 494). 
The differences with Lassalle were over matters of principle, 
which is why Marx and Engels avoided joint political actions with 
him lest he compromise them (pp. 261, 399-400, 469-70). At the 
same time, they considered that any public criticism of Lassalle 
would be injudicious, since his agitation was contributing to the 
political unification of the German working class. They foresaw, 
2*

XXXVI Preface 
however, that an open attack on his reformist and sectarian views was 
unavoidable. This is shown by a letter from Marx to Engels of 
12 June 1863, in which he wrote that he was only waiting for an 
opportune moment to reply publicly to Lassalle in order '1) to show 
the public how and where he had cribbed from us; 2) how and where 
we differ from his stuff (p. 480). Meanwhile, however, having 
realised the futility of trying to influence him, they virtually broke 
with Lassalle in 1863-64 by gradually ceasing to correspond with 
him. At this time, Marx and Engels considered that their task was 
the theoretical elaboration and dissemination of a scientifically 
based strategy and tactics for the German working-class move­
ment. They maintained a regular correspondence with their 
supporters in Germany, who were carrying on active revolutionary 
propaganda among the workers. 
The letters that Marx and Engels wrote in September 1864 after 
receiving the news of Lassalle's death give an objective assessment 
of his activity and his role in the German working-class movement. 
Marx stressed that Lassalle 'was one of the vieille souche [old stock] 
and the foe of our foes' (p. 560). In a letter to Marx of 4 September 
Engels noted that as a political leader, Lassalle was undoubtedly 'one 
of the most significant men in Germany', and by way of a 
summing-up he continued: 'For us he was a very uncertain friend 
now and would, in future, most certainly have been our enemy' 
(p. 558). 
The letters in this volume show how, thanks to his theoretical 
and journalistic activities and expanding contacts with the work­
ing-class movement, Marx's name had become known to a new 
generation by the time of the establishment of the International 
Working Men's Association. The services he had rendered 
predetermined his role as leader of the First International, and its 
development on a Marxist ideological platform. 
The correspondence during the period covered by the present 
volume is an important source of biographical information about 
Marx and Engels. It reveals their nobility of character and gives an 
insight into their domestic life and into their circle of friends. 
Marx's letters testify to his abiding love and respect for his wife. 
Arriving in Trier in December 1863, he writes to her, remember­
ing events of thirty years ago: 'I have made a daily pilgrimage to 
the old Westphalen home (in the Neustrasse), which interested 
me more than any Roman antiquities because it reminded me of 
the happiest days of my youth and had harboured my greatest 
treasure' (p. 499). 
The years 1860-64 were a difficult period for both men. Late in

1860 Jenny Marx fell seriously ill, and illness struck Marx himself 
down early in January 1861. These troubles were followed by 
serious financial difficulties. Having ceased to contribute to the 
New-York Tribune and Die Presse, he had lost a small but steady 
source of income. To prevent himself and his family from 'actually 
being relegated to the streets', as Marx wrote to Ludwig 
Kugelmann on 28 December 1862 (pp. 435-36), he decided to work 
in a railway office, but was rejected because of his bad handwriting. 
He was rescued by Engels' consideration, unselfishness, and constant 
readiness to help a friend in need. 'I can't tell you how grateful I am,-' 
Marx wrote to Engels on 28 January 1863, 'although I  myself...  did 
not require any fresh proof of your friendship .to convince me of its 
self-sacrificing nature' (p. 448). 
Meanwhile, Engels continued working in the offices of the 
Ermen 8c Engels firm 'as clerk with a percentage of the profits, in 
return for a guarantee that I shall become a partner in a few 
years'  time' (p. 134). He regularly sent Marx part of his income, 
also giving material aid to other comrades. In March 1860, Engels 
received the news of his father's death. A little while later, his 
mother, whom he loved very much, fell dangerously ill. 'I might 
acquire a hundred other businesses, but never a second mother,' 
he wrote to her on 27 February 1861. A heavy loss to Engels was 
the sudden death in January 1863 of Mary Burns, his faithful 
companion in life. 'I simply can't convey what I feel,' he wrote to 
Marx on 7 January 1863 (p. 441). 'I felt as though with her I was 
burying the last vestige of my youth' (pp. 446-47). 
Marx and Engels were always ready to come to the assistance of 
friends and fellow fighters who were having a hard time in 
emigration. In the summer of 1860, Marx, in spite of his own 
personal circumstances, rented a room for Eccarius, who was 
seriously ill, in an attempt to provide the conditions for his early 
recovery. Subsequently, both Marx and Engels stepped in to help 
their comrade and his family. 
In May 1864, death claimed an old friend and close associate of 
Marx and Engels—Wilhelm  Wolff,  who had been living in 
Manchester since 1853. After Wolff's death, Marx wrote to his 
wife:  'In him we have lost one of our few friends and fellow 
fighters. He was a man in the best sense of the word' (p. 523). 
Marx and Engels bore their trials and tribulations with courage 
and fortitude. They were helped in this by their great friendship 
and their implicit faith in the historical justice of the cause of the 
working class. It was from this that they drew the strength to 
continue the struggle.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN. MANCHESTER l 
[London, after 11 January 1860] 
11 January 1860 
Dear Marx, 
Today I am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of the supplement to 
No. 349 of last year's Kölnische Zeitung. 
The Wilhelm Joseph Reiff mentioned therein as having a warrant out against 
him for "immoral conduct" is, so I am told, none other than the Reiff who 
appeared at the trial of the Communists in Cologne and who is presently over here 
and living off the party. 
Now I have written to Reiff today (care of Liebknecht, not knowing how else to 
get in touch with him), informing him that I can no longer take any interest in 
him—that I forbid him to continue to use me as a reference—and that I will not 
tolerate his visits! 
Thus,  for my part, I have acted as I thought fit. What attitude the party will 
wish to adopt towards this dirty business is its own affair. You are now in 
possession of the facts! 
Your 
F. Freiligrath 
I had never received the said  'Reiff'  at my house because the 
fellow was suspect, and more than suspect, on account of his 
conduct at the communist trial,2  whereas the 'fat rhymester'" had 
taken him under his protection and saddled Liebknecht with him. 
Since then, the fellow has been living off Liebknecht, the 
Laplander, 15 Lessner, Schröder, etc., and other poor devils, besides 
having the hat passed round at the Workers' Society, 3 etc. 
The above letter from Freiligrath is all the news of the Teuton 
that I have had since the great retreat.4 And what an absurd letter 
it is. How grotesque the grandeur behind which there lurks the

mentality of a cringing cur. F. seems to think that prose can be 
put to rights with the help of exclamation marks. 'The party' is to 
'adopt an attitude'. Towards what? Towards Wilhelm Joseph 
Reiff's 'immoral conduct'—or 'this dirty business', as Beta's friend 
describes it. What an imposition. By the way, I might mention en 
passant that the 'Association of German Men', 5 founded by an 
equivocal compositor called Zinn, has nominated Prince Albert, 
Gottfried Kinkel, K. Blind and F. Freiligrath as its 'honorary 
freemen'. The Cheruscan 6 has, of course, accepted the charter. 
Next Monday I have to pay a £1 instalment at the Marylebone 
COUNTY-COURT.7 At the same time, I have received from the 
Westminster COUNTY-COURT (ON  BEHALF  OF A BAKER) the enclosed scrap of 
paper, which you must return to me. What I foresaw is coming to 
pass.  No sooner has one philistine found his way to the 
COUNTY-COURT than he is followed by another. If things go on like 
this, I really don't know how I can keep my head above water. 
What is so disastrous about these constant interruptions is that I 
simply cannot get on with my work.8 
The review in the Darmstadt Militär-Zeitung is most WELCOME. 9 
Your recent pamphlet3 has assured you a position as a military 
critic in Germany. As soon as you get the opportunity, you must 
publish something under your own name, adding beneath it 
'Author of Po and Rhine'. Our rascally enemies shall see  BY and  BY that 
we're able simply to impress the public without first seeking 
permission from it or its Betas. 
In my view, the most momentous thing happening in the world 
today is the slave movement—on the one hand, in America, 
started by the death of Brown,10 and in Russia, on the other. You 
will have read that the aristocracy in Russia literally threw 
themselves into constitutional agitation and that two or three 
members of leading families have already found their way to 
Siberia." At the same time, Alexander has displeased the peasants, 
for the recent manifesto declares outright that, with emancipation, 
'THE COMMUNISTIC PRINCIPLE' must be abandoned.b Thus, a 'social' 
movement has been started both in the West and in the East. 
Together with the impending DOWNBREAK in Central Europe, this 
promises great things. 
I have just seen in the Tribune that there's been another slave 
revolt in Missouri, which was put down, needless to say.12 But the

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 25 January 1860 
Dear Engels, 
Have you already heard about Vogt's pamphlet,3 in which there 
are the most horrible scurrilities concerning me? And, what is 
more, the thing is being jubilantly acclaimed by the Teutonicb 
bourgeoisie. The first edition has already been sold out. Yesterday, 
a LEADER in the National-Zeitung contained a long defamatory 
passage from it.c  (Any chance of your laying hands on this 
particular number of the Nat.-Zeit.} I haven't been able to get hold 
of it here.) Now, what ought I to do? Mr Lassalle would seem to 
have taken such umbrage at my last letter that there hasn't been a 
word from him since. 15 
I should be grateful if you could have an article READY for Friday 
or Saturday0 (there is a ship sailing via Cork). 
Salut. 
Your

Manchester,  26 January  1860 
Dear Moor, 
Tomorrow being Tribune day,17  I'm  sorry that there should 
again  be no  material  to hand;  the few  notes  on Morocco  in The 
Times"  don't even  run to the  engagement  at Cabo-Negro,18  nor 
has anything else happened. However, you'll have enough material 
with the  parliamentary  stuff. 1' I am  still waiting  to hear about  the 
reform  of the  Prussian army  as well.19 
Your opinion  of the  importance  of the  slave movement  in 
America  and  Russia1  is already being confirmed.  The  Harpers-
Ferry affair,'" with  its  sequel  in Missouri,12  is bearing fruit. 
Everywhere  the  free  NIGGERS' 1 in the  South  are  being hounded  out 
of the  states,  and I  have just seen from  the  first New York cotton 
report (W.  P. Wright  & Co of 10  January 1860)e  that  the  planters 
HURRIED  their cotton  ON TO  EHE PORTS IN ORDER TO GUARD AGAINST ANY PROBABLE 
CONSEQUENCES ARISING  OUI OE  THE HARPERS-FERRY AFFAIR.  In  Russia,  tOO,  the 
confusion  is growing admirably;  the  Augsburg  Allgemeine  Zeitung's 
St. Petersburg correspondent  is very good  on this subject, though 
he pays more attention  to the  constitutional movement among  the 
aristocracy,' which, however, also provides  a certain impetus  for 
the peasants,  of course. 
In India  we  have  the  makings  of a  tremendous crisis.  As far as 
the views  of the  local philistines  on the  subject  are  concerned, 
CONFER  the enclosed  MARKET REPORTS.  NOW  yarn prices are mostly so 
high, almost higher than  the  peak  in 1857,  and yet  cotton  is 2'7s 
to 2 V2d cheaper.  Twenty-six  new  mills  are  under construction  in 
Burnley alone,  and a  proportionate number  in other places.

8 4. Engels  to Marx.  26 January  1860 
Everywhere, by degrees, the workers are getting a 10% rise in 
wages and will shortly receive even more. In my view, the practice 
of operating on fictitious capital is again just as  RIKE  in Indian 
business as it was in 1846/47, and most people are buying only 
because they have to, and cannot stop. But, even if that were not 
so, the increase in production alone will bring about a colossal 
COLLAPSE  this autumn or in the spring of 1861 at the latest. 
Already these idiotic English believe that they will shortly 
inundate. France.20 A jackass of a calico  printer—ONE  OE THE 
SHARPEST—says  that, with a 30% protective tariff in France, the 
business he could do there would be 15% more profitable than on 
any other market. The fool imagines that monopoly prices will 
continue to obtain in France, even if the monopoly is abolished. It 
has occurred to no one that the whole thing is a piece of sharp 
practice, the aim being to get at John Bull where he is notoriously 
vulnerable, and ultimately to fleece him good and proper. 
Who,  actually, is the Mr Fischel who wrote the Duke of 
Coburg'sa pamphlet for him21  and now writes for The Free Press} 
Even from the excerpts from his pamphlet I could see that the 
Coburg chap has Urquhartite  LEANINGS. 
Dronke is now in Liverpool and holds a very good agency for a 
Franco-Spanish copper mining company—£500 guaranteed and 
the possibility of earning up to £1,000, or so I'm told. 
Garnier-Pagès got it for him. He comes here quite often, but 
always steers clear of me, sending me his regards post festum. 
Lupus has had a bad bout of bronchitis but is better now 
though still very anxious about himself and not yet fully 
recovered. Once again he has so arranged inatters as to be in a 
chronic state of strife with his  LANDLADY. 
I have a great deal to do at the office just now, hence the 
irregularity of my correspondence. Nor, for the time being, do I 
see that anything can be done about this excessive drudgery 
unless, as I hope, there is a crisis. 
Many regards to your wife and the  YOLNG  LADIES. h.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 28 January [1860] 
Dear Engels, 
I have ordered Vogt's pamphlet3  and shall also have one sent to 
you. It is the record (or first complete version) of his ineffectual 
lawsuit in Augsburg, together with an introduction. The latter is 
directed especially against myself and would seem to be a second 
and amended edition of Müller-Tellering. 22 As soon as the stuff 
arrives, we must see what we can do. Faucher told me WITH AN 
INTENSE PLEASURE that Vogt treats me pretty well en canaille b and with 
EXQUISITE contempt. The scoundrel tries to make the German 
philistine believe I am living here like a Dr Kuhlmann at the 
workers' expense, etc. (Needless to say, I have kept the whole 
squalid business from my wife.) 
A new military weekly has come out in Berlin.c  It seems to me 
that, on pretext of asking him about this paper's WHEREABOUTS, you 
should IMMEDIATELY write to Lassalle. It is essential for us to have 
some sort of connection in Berlin just now. L.'s reply to you will 
show whether we can carry on with him or not. In the latter 
case—which, all things considered, would not be pleasant—I 
should have to have recourse to Dr Fischel (Prussian assessor), 
about whom more anon. There is no reason why, in your letter to 
L., you should not let fall the remark that J consider the obstacles 
(or at least his warnings IN THAT  REGARD)  he placed in the way of my 
publishing a statement on Vogt in the Volks-Zeitung (the same, 
that is, as appeared in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung d), to be a 
kind of CONSPIRACY with Vogt on his and Duncker's part. Then, of 
course, you might drop a word or two to the effect that, in view of 
the ambiguous attitude of sundry old party friends (a few 
incidental  HITS UPON  Freiligrath 4), the difficulty of my position and 
the infamies I have to contend with, my TEMPER is, at times, a trifle 
frayed; further, that I have mentioned to you a letter I wrote to L. 
which the latter has apparently taken amiss.e You, for your part, 
will naturally suggest that L. knows me too well not to overlook an

nothing - c  Militärische Blatter - d K. Marx, 'Declaration', 15 November 1859. -

occasional brusque remark,  etc.  Then  he will at least cease  to beat 
about  the  bush.  I am  altogether  of the  opinion that  a certain 
amount  of diplomacy  is now  called for—if only  to find  out  just 
where  we  stand. After  all,  compared with  the  others,  L. is  still a 
HORSE-POWER. 
The fact  is the  various gangs—first  the  imperial rascals,23 
secondly  the  German National Association24  and,  lastly,  the 
liberals,  are  presently doing everything  in their power  to destroy 
us morally  in the  eyes  of the  German philistines. There  can  hardly 
be any  doubt that, despite  all the  clamour  for  peace,  THERE  WILL  BE A 
NEW WAR,  probably within  the  year, very probably before  the  advent 
of summer.  In any  case,  the  international situation  is so  complex 
that it is .oi the  utmost importance  to vulgar democracy  and 
liberalism  to stop  us  obtaining  a hearing from,  or access  to, 
German philistia  (i.e. the  public). There comes  a point when  one 
can no  longer turn  a blind eye—i.e. show indifference—in 
personal  and  party matters. Vogt's CASE does  not  lend itself  to 
exactly  the  same treatment  as that  of a  Tellering,  a Heinzen  or 
tutti quanti*  In Germany this same ventriloquist  is looked  on as a 
scientific celebrity;  he was  imperial regent  and is  financed  by 
Bonaparte.  You  might also—just,  as it  were,  en passant—ask  the 
noble Lassalle what action  he thinks appropriate  in the  matter  of 
V. In his  letters  to me, L. has  committed himself  too  deeply  to 
perform  a complete volte face.  At all  events,  an attempt must  be 
made  to force  the  fellow  to adopt  a definite position—aut, aut!' 25 
Fischel  is a  Prussian Urquhartite.  In the  Berlin Portfolio,  of 
which  he is the  publisher,  he has  alluded  to my  anti-Pamc 
pamphlets  and  printed some extracts from them.26  (On  Urquhart's 
express instructions.)  He had  been invited  by the  Urquhartites  to 
come  to England where  he was  paraded before  the  FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEES27  as evidence  of the  triumphant 'belief  (in  Urquhart) 
on the  Continent.  I met him  while  he was  over here.  He  offered 
me his  good services, should  I require them  in the  North German 
press. 
Hip-hip-hurray  and  away  to Italy0  (by  that louse Bamberger  in 
Paris)  is said  to contain attacks  on your articles  in the  Volk.2H 
What  did Mr  Orges  say in his  statement? 29 I missed  it. 
If possible, write something  for  Tuesdaye  (it doesn't have  to be 
long)  on the  military importance  of Savoy  (and  Nice)  to France.f

Apropos! 'In recognition of my services to the development of 
communistic principles', I have received an invitation to the 
anniversary celebrations on 6 February of the 'Workers' Educa­
tional Society' down here. (For these chaps still regard themselves 
as heirs to the old Windmill Association.)30  Similar invitations, if 
for different reasons, have gone out to Schapper, Pfänder and 
Eccarius. Circumstances being what they are, I have, of course, 
accepted the invitation, thus wiping out all traces of the old 
quarrel with the working men's bunch. Mr F. Freiligrath has not 
been invited. Indeed, I must now take care not to run into 
Potbelly. For in my present state of fury over the filthy Vogt 
affair—and F. F.'s magna pars" therein 4—fearful eruptions might 
well ensue. Regards to Lupus.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE

London, 30 January 1860 -
Dear Lassalle, 
I was very glad to get your letter. For I had believed—and had 
written to tell Engels so b—that your reason for not writing was 
pique at my last letter.15 
I can only spare a minute or two since I have a leader to write 
today for the New-York Tribune. Quite briefly then: 
1. I shall send you the pamphlet on the 'Communist Trial'1 
straight away. So far as I am aware, you have already had one 
from me.

12 6.  Marx  to Ferdinand  Lassalle.  30 January  1860 
2. Vogt  has been careful  not to let his  Telleringian concoction— 
i.e. the  first version 31—reach  us here. Neither Freiligrath (whom  I 
have just seen)  nor  Kinkel,  nor the  Hermann,  nor any of the 
booksellers over here have  had it. The  imperial rascal 23 wishes, OF 
COURSE,  to steal a march on me. 
What  I know,  I have learned from  the  National-Zeitung.*  A  pack 
of Stieberian lies.  I have written  and  told  my  lawyer  in Berlinh  to 
sue the N.-Z. for  libel. What  do you  think  of this?  Let me  know  by 
return. 
From your letter  I see  that Vogt himself admits having been 
bought indirectly  by  Bonaparte, 32 for I  know about  the  manoeuvres 
of your revolutionary Hungarians.  I denounced them  in London 
in an  English paper1  and had  five  COPIES  sent  to Mr  Kossuth.  He 
kept his  trap shut.  In New  York,  and  elsewhere, Hungarian 
refugees have adopted resolutions censuring  him. 
Your reasoning  ad vocem Vogt eludes  me. I  shall write  a 
pamphlet  as  soon  as I get  hold  of his  rubbish.  But I  shall begin  by 
saying  in the  foreword that  I don't give  a damn about  the  opinion 
of your German public. 
Liebknecht  is an  upright  man. The  Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung 
is—to  my  mind—just  as good  as the N.-Z. and the  Volks-Zeitung.™ 
To judge  by the  excerpts  I have seen  in the  N.-Zeitung, Vogt  is 
some kind  of Chenu  or de la  Hodde. 34 
3. About  my  work  on political economy—the second instalment, 
when  it appears, will contain only  the  conclusion  of  section  I, 
Book  I, and  there  are six  books.3'' Hence  you  cannot wait until  it is 
finished.30 However,  you  would,  in your  own  interests,  be well-advised 
to await  the  next instalment which contains  the  quintessence. 
Appalling circumstances  are to  blame  for the  fact that  it isn't  yet in 
Berlin.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 31 January 1860 
Dear Moor, 
I intend to write to Ephraim Artful' 1 tomorrow; a diplomatic 
missive such as this ought not to be sent off without due 
reflection. For a day or two now, I have been mulling over Savoy, 
Nice and the Rhine, a kind of sequel to Po and Rhine. I have made 
up my mind to offer the thing to Duncker; it won't be more than 
2 sheets long and might provide a good pretext for getting in 
touch with Ephraim. At all events, I shall write the thing in the 
course of next week, after which I shall immediately send the 
manuscript to Beruh. Apart from one or two matters concerning 
the French revolutionary campaigns in Nice and Savoy, no 
preparatory work is called for, so it will be soon done. 
Obviously Mr Vogt must be given a thorough lambasting; but 
it's difficult to say anything until we know what the fellow has 
actually published.' 1 At all events, you might just as well use 
Fischel as anyone else, provided he really does have connections.' 
Moreover, little Jew Braun d will now see that the significance of 
your statement c and of the whole set-to between Vogt and the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung*' is of quite a different order to what 
the Berlin philistine at first imagined. As things stand, we must 
maintain all these connections, while the conspiration du silence and 
other intrigues, to which we must meanwhile turn a blind eye, will 
subsequently release us from all obligations as soon as some crisis 
necessitates a breach on genuinely political grounds. 
As to the chances of a fresh set-to, I am entirely of your 
opinion.' But I believe that if, despite Vogt and Co., we are to 
keep our end up so far as the public is concerned, we shall have to 
do it through our scientific work. We haven't the money to 
organise the émigré press and several times we have seen that an 
émigré paper or German pamphlets printed in London never

command a public (in Germany) unless the thing can be kept 
going for a year at least. In Germany itself direct political and 
polemical action, as our party understands it, is a sheer 
impossibility. So, what remains? Either we hold our tongues or we 
make EFFORTS that are known only to the emigration and the 
American Germans but not to anyone in Germany, or else we go 
on as we have begun, you in your first instalment" and I in Po and 
Rhine. That, I think, is the main thing just now and, if we act 
accordingly, no matter how much Vogt may howl, we shall soon be 
back on a FOOTING such as will enable us (WHENEVER REQUIRED) to 
publish the necessary personal statements in one German paper or 
another. The early appearance of your 2nd instalment 38 is 
obviously of paramount importance in this connection and I hope 
that you won't let the Vogt affair stop you from getting on with it. 
Do try for once to be a little less conscientious with regard to your 
own stuff;  it is, in any case, far too good for the wretched public. 
The main thing is that it should be written and published; the 
shortcomings that catch your eye certainly won't be apparent to 
the jackasses; and, when times become turbulent, what will it avail 
you to have broken off the whole thing before you have even 
finished the section on capital in general? 8 I am very well aware of 
all the other interruptions that crop up, but I also know that the 
delay is due mainly to your own scruples. Come to that, it's surely 
better that the thing should appear, rather than that doubts like 
these should prevent its appearing at all. 
Mr Orges has issued a pur personal statement b which reveals 
who this queer fish is. Originally a Prussian lieutenant of artillery 
at the military college in Berlin (1845-48), at the same time, he 
pursued his studies and obtained his doctorate; he left the service 
in March 1'848 (his application to resign is dated 19 March '48) 
and went to Schleswig-Holstein where he joined the artillery; in 
1850,  he joined the crew of a merchant vessel, in which he 'served' 
and sailed round the world; in 1851, he attended the Exhibition in 
London, 39 which he reported for the A. A. Z.; he was then 
consorting with Schimmelpfennig, Willich, Techow, etc., and, 
subsequently, became the A. A. Z.'s military editor. At all events, 
there's more to the man than anyone else on the paper, which he 
has set on its feet again. The leaders I attributed to Heilbronner 
are all by him. Nevertheless, I'll still be able to deal with him good 
and proper.

MARX TO ENGELS

[London,] 31 January 1860 
Dear Engels, 
Your articlec received. Very good. 
Herewith a letter from Lassalle which arrived yesterday and to 
which I replied immediately, if briefly. d Only a pamphlet written 
by us jointly will get us out of this business. I have also written 
secretly to Fischel in Berlin, asking whether it is feasible to bring a 
libel suit against the National-Zeitung.*2 Vogt's piecee  (not to be had 
at any booksellers in London; he has sent it neither to Freiligrath 
nor to Kinkel, nor to any of his other acquaintances over here. 
Obviously he wished to steal a march on us. I have thus had to 
order it) is, so far as we are concerned, clearly a de la 
Hodde-Chenusian concoction. 34 I have read the second article in

the Nat.-Z? from which I see inter alia that Lupus (described as 
Casemate  Wolff,  Parliamentary Wolff) is alleged to have sent a 
circular to a reactionary Hanoverian paper in 1850.4!!  It gives a 
réchauffé of all the foul refugee gossip of 1850-52. The jubilation 
of the bourgeois press is, of course, unbounded, and the tone of 
Lassalle's letter—kindly show it to Lupus and then file it—clearly 
betrays the impression it has made on the public. 
Yesterday I saw Freiligrath for a moment. I approached him 
very ceremoniously (i-f he has the slightest sense of honour he 
must make an anti-Vogt statement), and all our entreviewb 
amounted to was the following: 'I: I've come to ask you to lend 
me the pamphlet on the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung lawsuit 
which I've been seeking in vain at all the booksellers and must 
certainly have been sent you by your friend Vogt. F. (very 
melodramatically): Vogt is not my friend. /: Lassalle has written to 
me that I must reply at once. You haven't got the pamphlet, then? 
F. No. /: Good evening.' (He held out his honest right hand and 
shook mine Westphalian-fashion.) Voilà tout. 1 
I was assured by Juch (owner and present editor of the 
Hermann, whose acquaintance I made in connection with the 
Stieber affair and Eichhoff's trial44  in Berlin), that Kinkel hadn't 
yet had a copy from Vogt either. This same Juch had, however, 
been sent numerous Vogtian tirades against us which he did not 
print. This chap—who is, incidentally, quite honest in his own 
way—has got to be kept mellow for the time being. Since only the 
Hermann is now appearing in London, it would have been 
dreadful to have to confront Vogt's gang unarmed, here on our 
own ground. 
Apropos! As a result of my first meeting with Juch,d  on my 
advice, Eichhoff cited friend Hirsch, who is doing time in 
Hamburg for forgery, as a witness for the defence. Consequently, 
the trial, due to begin on 26 January (I read about this in the 
Publicist),  was again adjourned after a heated argument. Stieber 
has now done with Hirsch.

My dear Sir, 
I conclude from your silence, that you have taken offence at my 
last letter,42 but I dare say, without any sufficient reason. You will 
not deny that by your own letter, the last but one, you did release 
me from the promise I had made to you.45 On the other hand, 
you may any day write to Berlin, and ascertain from Mr Duncker, 
the publisher, that he has called upon me not any longer to delay 
the sending of the manuscript due to him.8 Lastly, my proposal of 
Mr Kavannagh was, of course, meant to serve you, not me, and I 
proposed it only as a pis-aller.a 
Meanwhile, I took care to have a notice of your pamphlet (or 
rather of its impending appearance) inserted in the Weser-Zeitung, 
by a friend of mine. So soon as your pamphlet has come to my 
hands,  I shall feel happy to give a large article on the same in the 
New-York Tribune. Kossuth has tried, by another letter to 
McAdam, at Glasgow, to attract public attention in England. This 
time his effort has proved a complete failure. 
There is one affair, in which I require information on your 
part, and think myself justified to ask it from you. 
Prof.  Vogt (the tool of James Fazy at  Genf, b who is intimately 
connected, as Vogt is, with Klapka and Kossuth) has published a 
pamphlet on his lawsuit with the A. A. Zeitung c. This pamphlet 
contains the most absurd calumnies against  myself,  so that I 
cannot but reply to the scandalous libel, though I regret the time 
to be applied to so mean a subject. Well. He now contends that he 
received the money for his propaganda from revolutionary 
Hungarians, and, half and  half,  insinuates, that the money came 
directly from Hungary. How incredible, since Kossuth-himself 
could get none from that source. Can you inform me somewhat 
exactly about Klapka's circumstances at the time before the 
a last resort - b Geneva - c  C. Vogt, Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung,

outbreak of the Italian war?46  Since I shall be forced, in the 
pamphlet I intend writing," to speak of Kossuth et Co., somewhat 
largely, you will oblige me by adding what new points you have 
found out regarding his recent transactions. Has he, out of the 
3 millions, spent any part for paying or for arming a Hungarian 
corps? (I mean apart from the money given to military and civil 
dignitaries. b) 
The time becomes very critical, and, I hope, no misunderstand­
ing shall prevent our common action. 
Yours truly

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 1 February 1860 
Dear Moor, 
This time, then, the business is growing more serious every day. 
Mr Altenhöfer and the devious Hafner in Paris have each 
published personal, if somewhat vague, statements in the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung. 47 Now we get Lassalle's sagacious 
letter. 48 The chap is himself already almost a Bonapartist, at a time 
when coquetting with Bonapartism seems to be the order of the 
day in Berlin, so Mr Vogt will undoubtedly find the ground 
favourable  there.  A fine notion of Lassalle's, that one shouldn't use 
one's connection with the Augsburg A. Z. against Vogt and 
Bonaparte, yet Vogt can use Bonapartist money for Bonapartist 
ends and keep his hands perfectly clean! In the eyes of these folk, 
it is actually meritorious of Bonap. to have beaten the Austrians; 
the specific Prussian spirit and Berlin punditry are again in the

ascendant and things in that city must look almost as they did 
after the peace of Basle.49  There's no reasoning with such people. 
Lassalle seems to excrete this paltry, niggling pap as naturally as 
his turds, and maybe a good deal more easily—what answer can 
one give to such inanities and facile wisdom! Extraordinary advice, 
the chap doles out! 
Let's wait until we've got the pamphlet,3 and in the meantime 
cast round for somewhere to print and someone to publish our 
riposte. If possible, Germany and the opposing party's headquar­
ters, Berlin. The business of the 3,000 copies is plainly a lie of 
Vogt's.50  However, there's scandal enough and to spare. I shall go 
and see Lupus today and tell him to rack his brains for all the 
material he can lay hands on concerning Vogt. In the meantime, I 
shall sort through the papers dealing with 1850/52 and you must 
look out our old manuscript about the émigrés. b So far, I have no 
idea of what the fellow actually says. 
Regards  to the  FAMILY.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 2 February 1860 
Dear Moor, 
Conferred with Lupus last night. It was only while reading 
Lassalle's letter' out to him that I became fully aware not only of 
the chap's philistinism and arrogance, but also of his 'method'. 
Even in the paltriest of trifles, the fellow is Absolute Spirit Old 
Hegelian style and, just as he proposes in economics to assume the

role of a higher unity between you and the economists, the finite 
contradiction,51  so too he is already assuming the role of a higher 
unity between you and Vogt. Yours, the 'principle', Vogt's the 
'Italian policy' 52—and very nice too! What egregious schoolmaster 
presumption to start off by telling us we should declare Vogt 
hadn't been bribed, and then to proceed to take seriously, and 
thus reduce to absurdity, the one good joke in Fröbel's state­
ment! 53 
Lupus wonders whether, under Prussian law, the National-
Zeitung mightn't be compelled to accept a statement from you. I, 
too, believe the Press Law contains some such article.  IF SO, we 
should invoke it immediately on receipt of the pamphlet"; for, as 
Lassalle rightly remarks, habent sua fata libelli b; what that will be in 
the pamphlet's case one cannot tell, and the quicker the rejoinder, 
the surer will be its effect. 
Quoad c our pamphlet, we are at a disadvantage in being 
personally on the defensive and unable to return lies for lies. 
Then there's another disadvantage—namely, that the public= 
Philistia already detests us in advance, for while we do not actually 
stand convicted of odium generis humani,d we are guilty of odium 
generis bourgeois,5 and that amounts to exactly the same thing. 
On the other hand, we are at an advantage in being able to 
provide an exposé of our Italian policy which puts the matter on a 
totally different plane, leaves aside the personal aspect and places 
us in a favourable position, not perhaps in the eyes of the Berlin 
liberals, but in those of the greater part of Germany, in that we 
stand for the popular, national side. The Savoy affair in particular 
is something of a godsend to  us. 54 
Now it seems to me that, as soon as the pamphlet arrives 
(couldn't Lass, send it by post?), you should pack your bags and 
come up here, when we can decide once and for all what to do 
and how and where. I should gladly seize on the opportunity to 
come to London, but, as your wife is to be kept in the dark, it 
would be better if you were to come up here, the more so since, if 
any work is to be done, I couldn't stay so long in London. Another 
thing to be decided is whether I should appear on the title page; 
there's only one reason I can see against it, which, however, seems 
to me quite conclusive; but we'll discuss that when we meet.

The Savoy piece shall be donea  and Lassalle and Duncker

not yet been sent. 
It is extraordinary that I should have first learned of Heise's 
death via Dundee' and London. After all, the little chapd was here 
last Thursday or Friday and came to see me. I was out, however, 
and he also missed me at the club that evening. But, if he'd known 
about it, he'd surely have got someone else to tell me, as he usually 
does.  He saw Charles,'' too.

MARX TO ENGELS

Dear Engels, 
After one minor alteration, or rather the deletion of one 
sentence, C. D. Collet yesterday declared himself willing, but, at 
the same time, said that, as Urquhart was the actual editor, he 
must first submit the thing to him, which means a delay of 24 
hours. 55 Collet admitted that I could, of course, publish the 
statement malgré eux, 1 but, if it was done the way he suggested, I 
could subsequently, TO  A CERTAIN DEGREE, fall back on him and Urq. 
WEIL. I conceded this and intend to see what Father U. has to say. 
(For the sequel see immediately below.) 
Incidentally, it's no go either with a pamphlet or a statement in 
the newspapers—just now. The pamphlet would BE KILLED by the 
self-same press WHICH  NOW  TRUMPETS THE GRANDEUR  OF VOGT. The latter's

attack on me—he is obviously seeking to represent me as an 
insignificant and rascally bourgeois blackguard—(this ' emerges 
from everything I've learnt from hearsay up till now) is intended 
to be the grand coup of bourgeois vulgar democracy—and likewise 
of the Russo-Bonapartist riff-raff—against the party as a whole. 
Hence it must likewise be countered with a grand coup. Further­
more, the defensive does not suit our purpose. J shall sue the 
National-Zeitung. I've now made up my mind to do so. Not a great 
deal of money will be required for the time being—I am referring 
to the preliminary deposition in court. But lawyers will be 
exceptionally keen to make themselves available for, whatever 
happens, the lawsuit will make a great noise throughout the length 
and breadth of Germany. As soon as I have Fischel's letter" (it will 
arrive, I think, tomorrow) I shall issue a brief statement to the 
various German newspapers announcing that I am instituting an 
action for libel against the N.-Z. in Berlin. In its second article,b 
which I have got, I have already discovered items so actionable as to 
bring about its immediate undoing in a legal sense.c  This lawsuit will 
be the peg on which we can hang the whole of our riposte to  the public 
at large in court. Later on, we can turn our attention to that bastard 
Vogt. 
When you consider that in a week or two, in connection with 
Stieber, the Cologne communist trial2 will be re-enacted all over 
again,44 this vile attack could, if skilfully exploited, help rather 
than hinder us, for this will AT ONCE enable us to state our case 
forcefully to the mass of the workers. 
On the other hand, what evidence can Vogt or the National-
Zeitung produce against us? At the most, there is Techow's 
gossip 56 and, perhaps (in THE WORST CASE), some' not altogether 
pleasant reviews by Liming57  but, these apart, the fact that Vogt 
knows nothing of conditions here and makes the most absurd 
mistakes is apparent if only from his article in the Biel 
Handels-Courier. d 
So my plan is this: Next week, as soon as Vogt's rubbishe arrives, 
I shall come and visit you for a few days in order to talk the whole 
thing over.58 As to the costs of the action, Dronke (who, by the by, 
owes me money) must also bear his share. (Whatever happens you 
must come here a few days at Easter.)

For the rest (I have already written to everyone imaginable), in 
addition to procuring the necessary material for the action, I'm 
working on my Capital? If I set about it with determination, it will 
be finished in 6 weeks and, after the lawsuit, it will be a success. 
A fine thing it would be—with a crisis in the offing, with the 
KING  OF PRUSSIA  a at death's door, etc.—if we were to allow ourselves 
to be finished off in this way by Imperial Vogt 23 et cie., or

better part of the records for 1850/52 yesterday evening. Lupus 
cannot recollect anything at all and I have to keep jogging his 
memory. Not that I'm much better; since those days so much 
BITTER  BEER  has flowed down my gullet that many things are difficult 
to ascertain. As regards Lupus the following emerges: 
1. In 1851, not 1850, when the document appeared in the 
Karlsruher Zeitung (our plan of campaign against the democrats a), 
Lupus was still in Zurich'' and was attacked by the fellows as one 
who happened to be in their midst and was a member of our 
League.68 
2. Another document, however, had appeared previously in, if 
I'm not mistaken, the Hannoversche Zeitung, namely a circular from 
the Cologne Central Authority composed by Bürgers. 64 But I can't 
ascertain exactly whether it happened in the Hann. Ztg. You must 
go into this. 
3. Vogt has jumbled all of this up and has Lupus writing a 
document in London in 1850 which was produced in Cologne at a 
time when Lupus was still in Zurich. (L. came to London after 
5 May and before 21 July 1851.) All that remains to be ascertained 
is whether Bürgers' document really did appear in the Hann. 
Zeitung, and how it fell into the hands of the Hanover police. The 
letters I wrote you between February and April 1851 are bound to 
contain some mention of it. c Let me have particulars about this; 
without them I hardly imagine that Lupus' statement'1 will suffice. 
The item in The Times (original source Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung) had already been noted. 59 
I am starting on my thing" today. Up till now, the Vogt rumpus 
has prevented me from doing so. This time I shall again describe 
myself as the 'author of Po and Rhine' so as to get that personage 
all the more firmly established in the field of military literature— 
if I put my own name to it the immediate result would be a 
conspiration du silence. At the same time, however, i.e. about a 
fortnight after it comes out, I shall get Siebel to arrange for an 
appropriate review to appear in the papers. In general, this fellow

Dear Engels, 
Nothing from Berlin yet.11 If Izzy weren't a knave, incidentally, 
he would have sent me the National-Zeitung of his own accord, 
if nothing else, as soon as it came out. 
Now, as regards the extract from the N.-Z. for Lupus,1' what I 
wrote, on the first occasion, was from memory and was not 
intended as a basis for a public statement. On the second occasion, 
I was copying, and to avoid misunderstanding, am doing so again. 
I can't send the original as I haven't a second one to spare. 
Extract from No. 41 of the N.-Z., dated 25 January. (It is the 
concluding passage in the LEADER): 
'Only one further thing is worthy of note: The open letter to the National 
Association immediately fell into the hands of the Hanoverian reactionary party 
and was made known by this last; in 1850 another "circular" (as Vogt recollects, 
written by Parliamentary Wolff alias Casemate Wolff) was sent from London to the 
"proletarians" in Germany, and simultaneously allowed to fall into the hands of the 
Hanoverian police.'

Dear Moor, 
Received the circular addressed to Collet. a Comes altogether à 
propos, yesterday's Daily Telegraph having carried two columns 
about Vogt's shit b and the Brimstone Gang.65 If it amounts to no 
more than what's in the Telegr., then Izzy has been frightened by a 
fart. To 'parry the thrust', all one has to do is hold one's nose. 
Mr Ronge is up here. He hurried along to Siebel, saying he 
wished to be introduced to me!! Furthermore, he asked whether I 
also belonged to the Brimstone  Gang—IN  FACT, if it weren't for 
him, S., and if it weren't for S., I  myself,  wouldn't have heard 
about the nonsense in the Telegr. 
S., who's an out-and-out charlatan and'knows it, is dead keen to 
be of service to us in this business. He's got masses of connections 
and, best of all, is quite above suspicion. The fellow knows that the 
whole robber band, Kinkel and Co., are just as much humbugs as 
he is, and in us he has at last found people who are totally 
impervious to his humbug, inde c an unbounded admiration.

London, 8 February 1860

Haverstock Hill 
Dear Freiligrath, 
As an old party friend and an old personal friend, I consider it 
my duty to keep you informed of the steps I have taken in the 
furtherance of the Berlin lawsuit, by reason of which they must 
soon, though not immediately, become known to the public. 
You will recall or have seen from the printed English circularb 
sent you that, besides Hollinger's written statement, Blind cited 
that of certain compositor, Wiehe, in the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung" (etc.) as evidence that I had been guilty of 'a plain 
a K. Marx, 'To the Editors of the Volks-Zeitung. Declaration'. - b K. Marx, 
'Prosecution of the Augsburg Gazette'. - c K. Blind's statement in the Allgemeine 
Zeitung, No. 313, 9 November 1859. See this volume, pp. 60-62. Printed according to the original

falsehood' and that 'the imputation' that he, Blind, was the author 
of the pamphlet Zur Warnung, and that the latter had been 
printed for him by Hollinger or, indeed, had come off Hollinger's 
printing-press 'was a lie'. I am now sending you an exact copy of 
the sworn statement made by this man Wiehe before the 
magistrate in Bow Street. Of that statement I received an officially 
attested duplicate. One copy of the same is already on its way to 
Berlin for the Public Prosecutor's dossier. 
It would, I think, be superfluous were I at this point to add a 
single word of comment to the document. 
Your 
K. M. 
'One of the first days of November last—I do not recollect the exact date—in 
the evening between 9 and 10 o'clock I was taken out of bed by Mr F. Hollinger, in 
whose house (3, Litchfield Street, Soho) I was then living, and by whom I was 
employed as compositor. He presented to me a paper to the effect that I had been 
continuously employed by him during the1  preceding 11 months, and that during 
all that time a certain German flysheet "Zur Warnung" (A Warning) had not been 
composed and printed in Mr Hollinger's Office, 3, Litchfield Street, Soho. In my 
perplexed state,—and not aware of the importance of the transaction I complied 
with his wish, and copied and signed the document. He promised me money, but I 
never received anything. During that transaction Mr Charles Blind, as my wife told 
me at the time, was waiting in Mr Hollinger's room. A few days later Mrs Hollinger 
(Mr F. Hollinger's wife) called me down from dinner and led me into her 
husband's room, where I found Mr Charles Blind alone. He presented me the 
same paper which Mr Hollinger had presented me before, and entreated me to 
write and sign a second copy, as he wanted two, the one for  himself,  the other for 
publication in the Press. He added that he would show himself grateful to me. I 
copied and signed again the paper. 
'I herewith declare the truth of the above statements and that: 
'1. During the eleven months, mentioned in the document, I was for six weeks 
not employed by Mr Hollinger, but by a Mr Ermani. 
'2. I did not work in Mr Hollinger's Office just at the time, when the flysheet 
"Zur Warnung" (A Warning) was published. 
'3. 1 heard at the time from Mr Voegele, who then worked for Mr Hollinger, 
that he, Voegele, had together with Mr Hollinger himself composed the flysheet in 
question, and that the manuscript was in Mr Blind's handwriting. 
'4. The types of the pamphlet- were still standing, when I returned into 
Mr Hollinger's service. I myself broke them into columns for the reprint of the 
flysheet (or pamphlet) "Zur Warnung" (A Warning) in the German paper "Das 
Volk", published at London by Mr Fidelio Hollinger, 3 Litchfield Street, Soho. The 
flysheet appeared in No. 7, d. d. 18 June 1859 of "Das Volk". 
'5. I saw Mr Hollinger give to Mr William Liebknecht, of 14, Church Street, 
Soho,  London, the proofsheet of the pamphlet "Zur Warnung", on which 
proofsheet Mr Charles Blind with his own hand had corrected 4 or 5 mistakes. 
Mr Hollinger hesitated at first giving the proofsheet to Mr Liebknecht, and when

Mr Liebknecht had withdrawn, he, F. Hollinger, expressed to me and my fellow 
workman Voegele his regret for having given the proofsheet out of his hands. 
'Johann Friedrich Wiehe.

Wiehe at the Police Court Bow Street, London, this Royal Coat of Arms 
8th day of February, 1860, before me Th.a Henry. Bow Streetc

I would beg you, for the time being, not to show this copy of 
the affidavit to anyone. What the consequences would be under 
English criminal law will not escape you.

MARX TO ENGELS fi7 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 9 February 1860 
Dear Engels, 
To have offered your pamphletd  at two louis d'or per sheet is 
SHAMEFUL. Pamphlets of this kind ought to be sold, not by the sheet, 
but as a whole. Even 40 talers per sheet would be too little. 
Incidentally, Campe is better than Duncker. The publisher e who 
brings out the Darmstadt Militär-Zeitung 1 would gladly take the 
pamphlet, too. Actually, the main thing is that it should come out 
quickly and, if I were you, I would settle this matter, at least, by 
telegraph with that louse, Duncker.' i8 
I have been IN A SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE with ' The 
Daily Telegraph' since the day the shitg appeared. For before 
making amende honorable, the fellow h—I was as rude as hell to him

in my letter 42—wants  to await  his  correspondent's reply, whereas  I 
demanded  the  immediate insertion  of at  least  a brief note. 
Whatever  he  does  or does  not  insert,  I shall  now  bring down  a 
LIBEL ACTION  on his  head.  The  circumstances  of the  case being what 
they are, any  lawyer would happily undertake  the  thing  on  spec, 
as did, for  instance, Edwin James,  who  VOLUNTEERED  in Ernest 
Jones's  LIBEL ACTION  against Reynolds.69  I wrote  to Ernest Jones 
about this yesterday.42  On the  same Tuesday  as the  thing 
appeared,"  by the by, I  wrote  to the  EDITOR  of  Palmerston's 
MOB-PAPER  saying, inter alia:  'THAT LETTER PURPORTING  TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN 
FROM  FRANKFORT-ON-THE-MAIN,  BUT  WHICH  WAS IN  FACT INDITED  AT  BERLIN,  IS 
NOTHING  BUT A  CLUMSY AMPLIFICATION  OF TWO  LEADERS ETC.  ETC.' in the  Berlin 
National-Zeitungï  The  writer,  i.e. The  Daily Telegraph's swine  of a 
Berlin correspondent,  is a Jew by the  name  of Meier, 70 a relative 
of the  CITY-PROPRIETOR'S  who is an  English  Jew by the  name  of Levy. 
Hence, both these fellows rightly accuse Heine—juvanted  Vogt — 
of being  a baptised  Jew.  Herewith Izzy's last letter, which  you 
should retain  as a  curiosity. Calls himself objective, does  he? 
Inimitable,  the  plasticity  of this most unhellenic  of all  Wasser-
polack 71 Jews!  My  only reply  to the  fellow  was an  immediate 
announcement  in the  papers—including  the  Volks-Zeitung —to the 
effect that  I was  bringing  a libel action against  the  N.-Z. e (In  each 
case I enclosed  the  circular about Blind/ although, according  to 
the great Izzy,  I ought  'not to  delude myself  as to the  force  of that 
argument'.) 
All this week,  by the by, I've  been prevented from writing 
anything  for the  Tribune.  I have  had to  send  out  fifty letters  at 
least,72 running round  to see  Collet  and God  knows  who  else not 
CONSIDERED.  And on top of  that there  was the  correspondence with 
the beastly Telegraph  and the  correspondence with  the  Star,8  to 
which  I sent  the  whole  of my  correspondence with  the  Telegraph. 
The enclosed letter from  the  Star  is to be put on  your files.  I have 
also written  to Reynolds.42  Shall  see  what  he does. Then there  was 
the running  in connection with Wiehe  and  going  to the  police. 
The result  you  will find below.  Two  replies  so far to my  letters  to

Bristiersa  story. Another letter from Szemere. Most valuable on 
account of disclosures about, the revolutionary Hungarians' 'own' 
(excluding Bonapartist) funds out of which, so Vogt maintains, his 
money was received. A letter from Imandt, not so bad. b One or two 
points, at any rate. I am still awaiting an answer, notably from Mr 
Reinach in Neuchâtel, who is said to be a walking chronique 
scandaleuse" on the subject of the imperial  bailiff. 23 (Apropos. What 
address did the spy Hafner give in the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung? 47 There's a POINT I want to verify with him.) Have also 
written to Borkheim 42 (whom I have never met personally). Was 
CHIEF of the Brimstone Gang in Geneva who hung out at the Café 
de la Couronne and with whom on your occasional excursions you 
sometimes used to get tipsy, or so Schily tells me in his letter. 
I have drawn up the indictment against the Nat. -Zeit, for the 
public prosecutor's office at the Berlin municipal court. It will go 
off before I come up to you. But I must wait until I have Fischel's 
answer with regard to the commencement and conclusion, the 
prescribed form of address, etc. Should I send the package (since 
it has to include all manner of manuscripts, documents) to Berlin 
by post or by  PARCEL  COMPANY? It should at all events be REGISTERED. 
I have rummaged through everything I have here in London in 
the way of letters and newspapers for the period 1848-59, and 
sorted out and put in order what we need. Now you must get 
things ready so that I find everything that's available in one 'great 
pile' when I get to Manchester. 
Well, on Monday there was the working-men's banquet,d 
attended by eighty people. An indignant anti-Vogt resolution was 
unanimously adopted by 'the proletarians'. The beastly Hermann 
asked me to report on it. This I refused to do, but told them to 
obtain a brief account from Papa Liebknecht. 
Apropos, to  RETURN  à nos moutons," i.e. Lassalle. Not knowing, 
when I got his first letter, whether you had written to him as we 
had originally agreed (when CIRCUMSTANCES were otherwise), I told 
him in a couple of lines that I had thought the only explanation 
for his many-month-long silence must be annoyance at my last, 
somewhat rude (in fact excessively rude), letter. I said that I was 
glad this was not the case, and also that I had informed you of my

figurative sense it means 'to return to the matter in question'.

misgivings." WELL! What a FUSS the brute goes and makes about it! 
How presumptuous the moral attitude adopted by the chap 
towards Liebknecht! 7:i And this is the fellow who resorted to the 
most impudent means and consorted with the most impudent 
individuals au service de la comtesse de Hatzfeldt! Has the brute 
forgotten that, though I wanted to have him admitted to the 
League, he was rejected on account of his ill-repute by the 
unanimous decision of the Central Authority in Cologne?  IN FACT,  I 
believe, delicacy impelled me to keep the fellow in the dark about 
all this, as also about the working men's deputation sent over to 
see me a few years ago from Düsseldorf, which adduced the most 
scandalous and in part irrefutable allegations against him! ' 4 And 
now just look at the pretentious ape! No sooner—looking through 
his Bonapartist-tinted spectacles—does he think to descry some 
weak point in us, than he puffs himself up, pontificates, and 
strikes an—absurd, need one  say?  — attitude!  And contrariwise, 
how completely do his legal instincts desert him for fear that I 
should not, TO THE BENEFIT OF MY TENDER FRIEND Lassalle, allow myself 
without more ado to be pushed into the background by Vogt. 
How he contradicts  himself!  How mean he becomes! One 
shouldn't 'stir things up even more'. 'They' wouldn't 'take it 
kindly'. Not take it kindly! They! For the sake of his pale-ale 
Berlin philistines, I am to let myself be browbeaten by schoolmas­
ter Squeers, alias Zabel! Now I know just what to think of Mr 
Lassalle. 
I immediately wrote to Blind—or perhaps, I should say, put into 
an envelope the circular, which affects him so very closely.b He has 
kept his trap shut, of course. Instead, the brute goes running 
around town in the hope that things can be sorted out by 
tittle-tattle (vide below how much good that will do him). For the 
past few weeks the man's been indulging in feverish activity, 
publishing pamphlet after pamphlet, blowing his own trumpet in 
the Hermann for all he's worth, sucking up, fore and aft, to the 
few bourgeois whose acquaintance he made on the Schiller 
committee,7' pressing his own candidature as secretary of the 
recently conceived Schiller Association,'*' now denying his 'Pat­
riots', 77 now making himself important in their eyes by means of 
semicovert, statesmanlike allusions, etc. Well, all this amounts to, 
as you will instantly realise, is a drowning man clutching at a 
straw. 
No one has behaved so abjectly as that potbellied philistine 
Freiligrath. I sent him the circular.1' He didn't so much as

acknowledge its receipt. Does the brute believe that I couldn't, if 
so minded, immerse him up to the eyebrows in the lake of 
brimstonea? Has he forgotten that I possess a hundred or more of 
his letters? Does he imagine that I don't see him because he shows 
me his backside? Yesterday, I also sent the philistine the ensuing 
palliative, ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION that he should not say a word 
about it to anyone, including his friend the crypto-democrat Karl 
Blind. That will tickle him, and ere long he'll begin to feel uneasy 
at the undue proximity of the felonious friend in whose company 
he appeared before the public (as I reminded him  QUITE  en passant 
in my last letterb) in the pages of the A. A. Z.c Almost everyone, 
except for Freiligrath, even distant acquaintances, are behaving 
decently to me at this time of crisis. 
But to come to essentials. Firstly, I discovered through Juch that 
Wiehe once committed a theft in Bremen, which was why he had 
to come to London. Secondly, I learnt through Schapper that 
Wiehe introduced himself to him as a compositor on the Volk, and 
it was he who had obtained the fellow's present job for him. I 
briefed Schapper, who quietly intimated to Wiehe that he knew 
about the Bremen affair, but then proceeded to read my circular 
aloud in the presence of his EMPLOYER and to  CROSS  EXAMINE him. The 
fellow admitted everything. What the outcome was, you will see 
from the following document of which I possess an officially 
authenticated duplicate. One is going to Berlin. The other I shall 
keep here and employ in no uncertain manner against the 
nay-sayer. d One further point. This will show you the kind of 
people these 'honest fellows' consort with. I had, of course, let 
Wiehe know that I would compensate him for the loss of half a 
working day, the time he would have to spend with me at the 
police court. When all had been done, I gave him 2/6d. He 
remonstrated. Well, how much a day do you earn? I asked. ABOUT 
3/-, said he, but I want five from you. After all, I ought to get 
something for telling the truth. 
But the best is yet to come. I:* You have declined the money offer 
made by Blind and Hollinger in order to bribe you? He: Why 
decline! The rogues promised, but never gave me anything.* That's 
compositor Wiehe for you. But Hollinger is a villain of far deeper 
dye. Vögele, whom I had arranged to see yesterday, did not turn up. 
Doubtless Blind-Hollinger made it worth his while to keep away. But

they'll have thrown their money down the drain. For I know that this 
chap has still got a conscience, and so I shall work on him.78 My 
circular misled them into approaching the wrong man. They 
believed it meant that I wouldn't be able to get at Wiehe  himself. 
Well, now ad rem": 
'One of the first days of November last—I do not recollect the exact date—in 
the evening between 9 and 10 o'clock I was taken out of bed by Mr F. Hollinger, in 
whose house I then lived, and by whom I was employed as compositor. He 
presented to me a paper to the effect that during the preceding 11 months I had 
been continuously employed by him, and that during all that time a certain 
German flysheet "Zur Warnung" (A Warning) had not been composed and printed 
in Mr Hollinger's Office, 3, Litchfield Street, Soho. In my perplexed state, and not 
aware of the importance of the transaction, I complied with his wish, and copied, 
and signed the document. Mr Hollinger promised me money, but I never received 
anything. During that transaction Mr. Charles Blind, as my wife informed me at 
the time, was waiting in Mr Hollinger's room. A few days later, Mrs Hollinger 
called me down from dinner and led me into her husband's room, where I found 
Mr Charles Blind alone. He presented me the same paper which Mr Hollinger had 
presented me before, and entreated me to write, and sign a second copy, as he 
wanted two, the one for  himself,  and the other for publication in the Press. He 
added that he would show himself grateful to me. I copied and signed again the 
paper. 
'I herewith declare—upon my oath—the truth of the above statements and 
that: 
'1. During the 11 months mentioned in the document I was for six months'5 not 
employed by Mr Hollinger, but by a Mr Ermani. 
'2. I did not work in Mr Hollinger's Office just at that time when the flysheet 
"Zur Warnung" was published. 
'3. r heard at the time from Mr Voegele, who then worked for Mr Hollinger, 
that he, Voegele, had, together with Mr Hollinger  himself,  composed the flysheet 
in question, and that the manuscript was in Mr Blind's handwriting. 
'4. The types of the pamphlet were still standing when I returned to 
Mr Hollinger's service. I myself broke them into columns for the reprint of the 
flysheet "Zur Warnung" in the German paper "Das Volk" published at London, by 
Mr Fidelio Hollinger, 3, Litchfield Street, Soho. The flysheet appeared in No. 7, 
d. d. 18th June, 1859, of "Das Volk". 
'5. I saw Mr Hollinger give to Mr William Liebknecht, of 14, Church Street, 
Soho,  London, the proof sheet of the pamphlet "Zur Warnung", on which 
proofsheet Mr Charles Blind with his own hand had corrected 4 or 5 mistakes. 
Mr Hollinger hesitated at first giving the proofsheet to Mr Liebknecht, and when 
Mr Liebknecht had withdrawn, he, F. Hollinger, expressed to me and my fellow 
workman Voegele his regret for having given the proofsheet out of his hands.

IN BERLIN 
London, 13 February 1860 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Sir, 
Last week I wrote to a friend" in Berlin requesting him to 
recommend a lawyer for a libel action, which I am compelled to 
bring against the Berlin National-Zeitung.42 Today I have received 
a reply in which my friend names you, Sir, as the most eminent 
lawyer in Berlin. 
I am therefore taking the liberty of asking whether you will 
agree to act as my lawyer in the libel action, further information 
concerning which is given below. 
Should the provisional retaining fee of 15 talers herewith 
enclosed not suffice, kindly telegraph me. I shall then immediately 
despatch whatever additional sum may be required. 
I enclose herewith the power of attorney and trust that this 
instrument will suffice. I would earnestly beg you to institute the 
action forthwith, lest it become statute-barred, and should be much 
obliged if you would inform me by telegraphic despatch that you are 
taking the necessary steps.

23. Marx to J. M. Weber. 13 February 1860 41 
I have simultaneously begun an ACTION  FOR  LIBEL  against The Daily 
Telegraph here in London, which paper printed an English 
version3 of the National-Zeitung's calumnious articles.b 
I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, 
Dr Karl Marx 
(vertec) 
The articles in the National-Zeitung alluded to in the preceding 
letter are to be found in No. 37 (dated Sunday, 22 January 1860) 
and No. 41 (dated Wednesday, 25 January 1860), both of them 
leaders. In subsequent letters I shall take occasion to characterise 
the animus by which these articles were inspired. But the specific 
points on which I wish to bring an action for libel, and which seem 
to me the most cogent from the legal point of view, are the 
following: 
1. In No. 41 (article is headed 'Wie man radikale Flugblätter 
macht'),  column 3 (towards the bottom) reads: 
'In the Allgemeine Zeitung Blind has twice declared 0 outright that he is not the 
author' (i.e. of the flysheet Zur Warnung); 'nor does he say this to exculpate Vogt, 
with whom he does not agree, but simply for the benefit of the Marx-Liebknecht-
Biscamp camp ... he' (Blind) 'is obviously not a member of the Marx party in the 
narrower sense. It appears to us that the latter did not find it too difficult to turn 
him into a scapegoat, and if the charges levelled at Vogt were to carry any weight, they 
had to be attributed to a definite person who would have to be responsible for 
them. The Marx party could very easily saddle Blind with the authorship of the pamphlet 
because and after he had expressed similar views to those contained in it in 
conversation with Marx and in an article in The Free Press.' By making use of Blind's 
assertions and turns of phrase the pamphlet could be fabricated and made to look as if 
he' (i.e. Blind) 'had concocted it.' 
Here, then, I am actually accused of having 'fabricated' a 
pamphlet in another man's name. Furthermore, in the same article 
(same column, further up), the National-Zeitung itself informs its 
readers that I had sent the A. A. Z. a 'deposition by the compositor 
Vögele', m in which the latter said that 'he knew Blind's handwriting 
from previous manuscripts; he himself had set the first part of the 
pamphlet on Hollinger's press, and Hollinger himself had set the 
rest'; thus, in the passage quoted above, the National-Zeitung 
a [K. Abel,] 'The Journalistic Auxiliaries of Austria', The Daily Telegraph, No. 1439, 
6 February 1860. - b  'Karl Vogt und die Allgemeine Zeitung' and 'Wie man radikale 
Flugblätter macht', National-Zeitung, Nos. 37 and 41, 22 and 25 January 1860. -
c PTO - d Blind's statements in the Allgemeine Zeitung, Nos. 313 and 345, 
9 November and 11 December 1859. - e [K. Blind,] 'The Grand Duke Constantine 
to Be King of Hungary', The Free Press, No. 5, 27 May 1859.

42 23. Marx to J. M. Weber. 13 February 1860 
insinuates not only that / fabricated a pamphlet and fraudulently 
made it appear to be a 'concoction' of Blind's. It insinuates outright 
that I had wittingly sent the Augsb. Allg. Zeitung a spurious 
document. And, to crown its animus calumniandi,' 1 it goes on: 
'Thereupon, on 2 November, Hollinger declared that it was a malicious 
invention to say that the pamphlet had been printed in his workshop or that Blind 
was its author, adding that his compositor, Wiehe, who had worked for him for 11 
months, concurred with this statement. Marx, always ready with an answer, replied 
in the Allgemeine Zeitung on November 15 b: 
'"Hollinger's declaration is simply ridiculous. Hollinger is aware that he has 
formally infringed English law by publishing the pamphlet without declaring the 
place of publication." In addition, Marx several times insists that, before the 
pamphlet came out, Blind had communicated its contents to him verbally and had 
put down in writing exactly what later appeared in the pamphlet; hence, because of 
the similarity in content and form, Blind had, de prime  abord, 1 been regarded as the 
author.' 
Here, in order to introduce the passage cited above, which is 
defamatory to  myself,  the National-Zeitung omits deliberately that 
part of my statement in the supplement to the Augsburg A. Z. of 
21 November 1859 which is of most significance to lawyers, and 
to English lawyers in particular. I enclose the cutting from the 
Augsburg A. Z., in which I have underlined for your benefit what 
was deliberately omitted from my statement by the National-
Zeitung? 
In accordance with universal legal usage, it should now be 
incumbent on the Nat. -Zeit, to prove that its defamatory charge 
against me is true. But I shall let you have legal evidence to the 
effect that it is false. You will even see that under English law I am 
now in a position, should I so wish, to have Mr Blind consigned to 
the galleys for  CONSPIRACY  against me. 
2. No. 37 of the Nat. -Zeit., the leading article entitled Karl Vogt 
und die 'Allgemeine Zeitung', column 2, reads (I quote): 
'Vogt reports on p. 136 et. seq.: Among the refugees of 1849 the term 
Brimstone Gang'"; or the name of the Bristlers, e referred to a number of people 
who,  originally scattered throughout Switzerland, France and England, gradually 
congregated in London, where they revered Herr Marx as their visible leader.' 
a deliberate libel - b  This refers to Marx's 'Declaration' of 15 November, published 
in the supplement to the Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 325, 21 November 1859. - c from 
the very start - d Marx presumably refers to point 2 of his 'Declaration'. - c  See this 
volume, p. 70, and Marx's Herr Vogt (present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 38-47). 

=====第79页=====
23. Marx to J. M. Weber. 13 February 1860 43 
I shall let you have evidence to the effect that in this passage 
two quite distinct Genevan societies have been lumped together, 
neither of which ever had, or sought to make, any connection 
with me. But this I consider to be of no more than secondary 
importance. The actual passage upon which I wish the second 
point in the libel action to be based is one that occurs 
subsequently and which I shall now quote: 
One of ilic chief occupations of the Brimstone Gang' (ostensibly under my 
COIIHII.UK!,  \\<IS  to compromise people at home in Germany in such a way that they were 
forced to pa\ moim' so that the gang should preserve their  secret  without compromising them. 
Not just one, but hundreds of letters were written to people in Germany threatening 
to denounce them for complicity in this or that act of revolution unless a certain 
sum of money had been received at a specified address by a certain date.' 
It will now be incumbent on the National-Zeitung to substantiate 
the charge of boundless depravity it brings against me by 
producing in court, not hundreds of letters, not one letter, but one 
single line containing infamous blackmail of this nature, and of 
which it can be proved that it emanated, I won't say from  myself, 
but from any person with whom I have ever had anything to do. 
The passage cited above continues as follows: 
'Following the principle that "whoever is not unconditionally for us, is against 
us", the reputation of anyone who opposed these intrigues' (i.e. the blackmailing 
letters previously described) 'was ruined, not just among the refugees, but also 
by means of the press. The "proletarians" ' (as whose chief I am portrayed) 'filled 
the columns of the reactionary press in Germany with their denunciations of those 
democrats who did not subscribe to their views; they became the confederates of the 
secret police in France and Germany.' 
It will, of course, be easy for the Nat.-Zeit. to find in the 'columns 
of the reactionary press' thus  filled,  one single line emanating 
from myself or friends of mine which contains 'denunciations' 
against any 'democrat' whomsoever. 
It is absolutely correct—and this is the only  FACT—that 
Ferdinand Freiligrath wrote a satirical poema about Mr Kinkel's 
revolutionary loan and his revolutionary tour of the United States, 8^ a 
poem which was first published by my friend Weydemeyer in a 
journal appearing in New York,1' and subsequently printed in the 
a p Freiligrath, 'An Josef Weydemeyer. Zwei poetische Episteln', Epistel 1.- b Die 
Revolution 

=====第80页=====
44 23. Marx to J. M. Weber. 13 February 1860 
Morgenblatt? But that could certainly not be described as a 
'denunciation'. In actual fact, the so-called democratic emigration 
(German) filled the German press with the most inane tittle-tattle 
about  myself.  There was only one instance which I felt merited the 
trouble of a reply, but the paper to which I sent the rectifying 
statement did not print it. b 
The only German paper for which I have written since going 
into exile has been the Neue Oder-Zeitung. I was its correspondent 
from about the beginning of January until July 1855. Not once 
did I devote a single line to the émigrés. 
As regards Liebknecht's articles for the Augsb. Allg. Zeitung 
which likewise never contained a line about émigrés —and which, 
by the by, reflect great credit to him (their content, I mean)— 
these have nothing whatever to do with me. I shall be writing to 
you about this at greater lengths 
Needless to say, my alliance with the secret police in Germany and 
France has for me the spice of novelty. 
3. In the above cited No. 41, 'Wie man radikale Flugblätter 
macht', the National-Zeitung identifies the 'party of the proletariat', 
as whose chief it describes me, and hence  myself,  with 'a conspiracy 
of the most infamous sort, with the manufacturing of counterfeit 
paper-money on a massive scale, etc' which purportedly took 
place in Switzerland in 1852, and likewise with similar 'machina­
tions'  in 1859 which purportedly caused the German states, 'after 
the Peace of Villafranca', to raise the matter with the Swiss 
'Federal Council'. 
Later, I shall show in greater detail that I had nothing whatever 
to do with these matters having, indeed, abandoned all agitation 
since September 1850, and that, while the Cologne communist trial 
was pending (1851-52),2 I disbanded the communist society to 
which I belonged,63  nor have I since that time belonged either to a 
secret or to a public society. That the Nat. -Zeit, was deliberately 
libellous on this point, too, may be deduced from the fact that it 
must have known from the communist trial in Cologne that /  myself, 
through counsel there, denounced as a police agent the fellow said 
to have been active in Switzerland in 1852, and that Stieber 
himself was forced to admit that this fellow had been my enemy 
since 1850. If necessary, I can provide you with evidence to the 
a Morgenblatt für  gebildete  Leser - b This presumably refers to the 'Statement' by Marx 
and Engels which was to be published in the Weser-Zeitung and the New-Yorker 
Staatszeitung in early 1851 (present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 535-36). - c See this volume, 
pp. 66-67.

23. Marx to J. M. Weber. 13 February 1860 45 
effect that this fellow (Cherval, real name Cramer) never had any 
connection with me, even before 1850. 
4. The final point in the libel action should be based on the 
following passage in No. 41, 'Wie man radikale Flugblätter macht', 
column 2, which runs: 
' Where the money for this generously distributed paper' (i.e. the Volk, published 
in London) 'came from, is known to the gods; men, however, are well aware that 
Marx and Biscamp have no money to spare.' 
Taken in conjunction with the animus of the two leading 
articles, with the way I am lumped together with secret police, 
reactionaries and a Brimstone Gang extorting money through 
chantage and revolutionary threats, this sentence can only imply 
that I obtained money for the Volk in a dishonest fashion or by 
underhand means. It is now up to the National-Zeitung to 
substantiate this libel. I, for my part, shall provide you with 
information, not only about the financial contributions obtained by 
me for the Volk, but also, in so far as this is necessary, about my 
own—in Mr Zabel's eyes," dubious—financial circumstances; and 
that information will be such as will enable you to prove the very 
opposite of the defamatory insinuation put forward by the 
Nat.-Zeit. 
I would beg you, when you reply to this letter, to let me know 
upon which points you require further elucidation/ 
P. S. Since it would otherwise be too late to post this letter, I 
shall send on the power of attorney tomorrow. If at all possible, this 
evening under separate cover.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 13 February 1860 
DEAR FREDERICK, 
The booka arrived today. Nothing but shit. Sheer tripe. Luckily, 
the worthy National-Zeitung has reprinted in its two leaders 
(No.  37 and No. 41) all the passages which are actionable and in 
which all the scurrilities are concentrated. 
Today (on receiving a second letter from Fischel), I at once sent 
Legal Counsellor Weber (the leading lawyer in Berlin) an 
indictment together with a retaining fee of 15 talers (£2 10sh). b 
The case would have cost me nothing if, instead of instituting a 
private action for libel, I had had recourse to the Royal Prussian 
Public Prosecutor, but as I wrote and told Fischel,c I could not 
expect the Royal Prussian Public Prosecutor to 'display especial 
zeal in upholding the honour of my name'. Moreover, the whole 
procedure costs very little. 
Of the £5 you sent me, £2 10 has therefore gone to Weber, £1 
today to the COUNTY-COURT,  5/—to  Vögele and 2/—on the two 
AFFIDAVITS he made d; also a LOT on stamps for letters. Before going 
to the CITY today I had to borrow a further £1 from a baker, 
repayable on Wednesday. 
Luckily, Urquhart has written Collet a rude letter in which he 
lashes out at him for sending me the PRINTER'S BILL.82 This (i.e. my 
publication) was, he said, an expense chargeable to his agitational 
activities. So I don't have to pay him. 
Tomorrow I shall be faced with yet another expense and I don't 
know how I'm going to meet it. For I have got to call on that 
bastard Zimmermann (from Spandau, a Vogtian and, at the same 
time,  an advocate to the Austrian Embassy) so that he can supply me 
with the wording for the power of attorney which must go off to 
Weber without delay. There's no time to be lost, you see, because 
actions of this kind become 'statute-barred' remarkably quickly in 
Prussia.

In addition to the Volks-Zeitung, the Berlin Publicist has 
published my statement, 2 the latter having placed it alongside an 
extract from the English anti-Blind circular.b  This last I have today 
sent to Louis Blanc and Félix Pyat, together with the AFFIDAVITS of 
Wiehe c and Vögele. 
The Kölnische Zeitung and the N.-Z. did not publish my 
statement. 83 
Mr F. Freiligrath—whom (with seeming benevolence) I shall 
compromise in no mean fashion—did not even acknowledge 
receipt of the things I sent him. 
You must surely have got my last important communication?d 
After I've settled the matter of the power of attorney tomorrow, 
I shall leave on Wednesdaye (having notified you beforehand) for 
Manchester where, in addition to our indispensable meeting, I 
have business connected with Roberts. 
You will have gathered from the foregoing that I'm now

„ „. 6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Sir, 
I am in receipt of your note of the 13th and regret that I am 
only now able to send the manuscript enclosed herewith.3 I hardly 
imagine that it will run to more than 3 printed sheets. 
I don't quite understand the provisos you make concerning 
considerations of principle, unless you wished to make a general 
proviso to the effect that you must see the manuscript be­
forehand.86  I cannot believe that you wish to assume moral, logical 
and aesthetic responsibility for everything you publish, from Marx 
to Jacobus Venedey and from Lassalle to Palleske, or to associate 
your publishing house with the line of the Volks-Zeitung, on which 
I cannot comment since it is not to be had in Manchester. If, 
however, the considerations of principle are connected with 
Lassalle's pamphlet on Italy, b which admittedly does not tally with 
my views on the subject, I do, of course, respect such reservations 
on your part, but I also know that Lassalle is certainly the last 
person who would wish this to be taken into account. I am 
therefore writing to Lassalle c in the firm conviction that he would 
consider it an insult, were he thought capable of doing the 
slightest thing to obstruct the publication of a piece that differed 
from his own views on the subject. 
[Should] d you feel, however, that the pamphlet is unacceptable 
to your publishing house by reason of its length or its principles, I 
would request you to deliver it within twenty-four hours of receipt to 
Mr B. Afinger (Sculptor), 
Linienstrasse 173, Berlin. 
I have sent the letter to Borkheim. 
I remain, 
Yours truly,

ENGELS TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 20 February 1860 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Lassalle, 
Many thanks for sending me Vogt's concoction." More about this 
below. 
As Duncker has doubtless told you, I have offered him a sort of 
sequel to Po and Rhine" which he accepts subject to the proviso 
'considerations of principle'.' Even though I find it somewhat 
surprising that the publisher and not the author should be 
responsible for the principles advanced in a work, I have, 
nevertheless, tried in vain to discover what can be meant by this. 
Surely D. isn't claiming that his publishing house is simply an 
extension of the Volks-Zeitung, which, by the way, I never see up 
here.  Finally, it occurred to me that D. may have got wind of the 
fact that my views on the Italian question are different from yours 
and made this proviso out of excessive concern for your 
pamphlet/ I'm convinced that, should this be the case, I would 
only have to draw your attention to it, for you to reassure D. on 
this score.  In view of your objectivity, you would, I know, consider 
it an insult, were anyone to suppose you capable of even remotely 
desiring the suppression of a work because it was opposed to your 
own views on a question of this kind. In fact, I had to spend a 
long time thinking things over before I could make up my mind 
to raise this point with you, being afraid you might be offended 
with me for assuming such -imputations to be possible, even at 
third hand. But since there seems no other explanation for D.'s 
'considerations', I have no choice. 
Settling Vogt's hash will be mere child's play. We dealt with this 
ancient, warmed-up drivel as much as eight years ago87 (though 
the little Genevan philistine in his secluded corner doesn't know it) 
and we'll jolly well demolish it so that nothing's left but the stench,

peculiar to Vogt, which he has injected into it. Incidentally, the 
statements of Blind, 3 Biscampb and, in particular, Lupusc  have 
compromised the fellow to such an extent that, if things go on like 
this, there'll be literally nothing left to do. And now we have 
Schaible's statement about the provenance of the pamphlet Zur 
Warnung,'' which completely nullifies the legal proceedings in 
Augsburg 88 and will ultimately compel Vogt, should he wish to 
demonstrate the contrary, to do so in London. All this has, of 
course, meant our rummaging through the whole of our archives, 
in which we have the life histories of the entire democratic gang; 
we can do for every one of them. This ignoramus Vogt, with his 
letter from Techow 56 (which Vogt stole, to boot) and his paltry, 
parochial Genevan gossip, imagines that we others are just as 
ignorant, just as low and just as cowardly as he. He is in for a 
surprise. 
Most cordially, 
Yours,

seemed to me best to wait until the latest date (namely yesterday, 
20 February) by which your written reply might be expected to 
reach London from Berlin. 
Since this did not arrive and since, on the other hand, you did 
not reject by telegraph my request that you should act as my 
lawyer, I assume that you have accepted my  brief.  To avoid 
further loss of time, I am therefore sending you the following in 
this registered letter: 
1. The power of attorney; 
2. 7 enclosures, together with translations where the original is in 
English. 
These enclosures comprise: 
1. A. Vögele's affidavit 78; 
2. J. F. Wiehe's affidavita; 
3. My English anti-Blind circular.b 
4. and 5. Two letters concerning this matter from the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung to me. 89 
6. Dr Schaible's statement in the London 'Daily Telegraph' of 
15th February 1860, page 5, column 5, paragraph headed 'The 
Vogt Pamphlet'. 
7. A letter from K. Blind to Liebknecht dated 8 September 
1859. 90 
Tomorrow, by which time I shall, perhaps, have received a letter 
from you, I shall take the liberty of sending you some comments 
on these documents. However, you will see at first glance that the 
infamous conduct attributed to me in No. 41 of the National-
Zeitung, where I am portrayed as the anonymous fabricator of 
papers allegedly circulating in other people's names, is irrefutably 
shown in law to be an infamous libel. 
As regards the affidavits (statements made in court in lieu of an 
oath),  all I would say is this: i 
You will note that in affidavit enclosure II, the words  UPON  OATH-
have been deleted by the magistrate. For he explained to us that a 
statement made before him was the equivalent of a sworn 
statement, that a false statement was a felony and hence punishable 
with  TRANSPORTATION  but that, under English law, an oath could 
properly be administered only in the presence of the defendant. 
The rest I shall leave for tomorrow, pending which I remain, 
Sir, 
Your very obedient Servant, 
Dr. K. Marx

MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH91 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 23 February 1860a 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Freiligrath, 
I am writing to you again and, indeed, for the last time, about 
the Vogt affair. You have not so much as ACKNOWLEDGED receipt of 
my first two communications, 13 a courtesy you would have 
extended to any philistine. I cannot possibly surmise that you 
imagine I am trying to extort a letter from you for any public 
purpose. As you are aware, I possess at least 200 letters of yours, 
in which there is more than enough material to establish your 
relations with me and with the party, should it prove necessary. 
I am writing to you because, as a poet and a man up to his eyes 
in business, you would seem to misconceive the significance of the 
lawsuits I am conducting in Berlin and London.92 They are crucial 
to the historical vindication of the party and its subsequent position 
in Germany; this applies all the more to the lawsuit in Berlin in 
that it is taking place at the same time as the Eichhoff-Stieber 
case, 44 which turns mainly on the Cologne communist trial.2 
The GRIEVANCES you may perhaps be nourishing against me are 
the following: 
1. That I abused your name (or so you told Faucher). 
2. The kind of 'scene' I made you in your OFFICE.

30. Marx to Ferdinand Freiligrath. 23 February 1860 55 
Re I. I personally have never mentioned your name, except for 
saying in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung that Blind had told you 
much the same as he told me. a This is a  FACT.  From the first I 
realised how important it was to call attention to the real origins of 
the pamphlet,b and I had the right to cite a witness in connection 
with what Blind had said. 
As for Liebknecht'^ letter to the editor of the A. A. Z., in which 
he mentions your name and mine (with reference to Blind 93), he 
will, if necessary, confirm on oath that this was done without my 
knowledge, just as he sent the Augsb. Allg. Zeit, the pamphlet 'Zur 
Warnung' without my knowledge and during my absence in Manchester. 
When Vogt sued the A. A. Z. and the latter turned to him 
[Liebknecht],  he was still in doubt as to whether or not I should 
disavow him, as I could have done, and was in fact surprised when 
I immediately said I would do all I could to help him. 
If—in the letter I wrote you'—I took his side in the matter of 
your letter to him, this was simply because it seemed ungenerous, 
in a man of your repute and social standing, to write so harshly to 
an obscure party member living in a garret and one with whom 
you had hitherto been on friendly terms. 
As regards the irritable tone of my own letter, there were 
various reasons for that. 
Firstly, I was deeply wounded by the fact that you seemed more 
inclined to believe Blind than  myself. 
Secondly, from a letter you wrote me in a very irritable vein 
regarding The Morning Advertiser (Schiller Festival article'1) you 
would seem to consider me capable of the enormity, not only of 
surreptitiously introducing into Blind's article something injurious 
to yourself,  but of actually denouncing this to you as Blind's 
handiwork.94 I was at a complete loss to imagine what I could have 
done to deserve such injurious suspicions. 
Thirdly, you showed Blind a private letter I had written you. 
Finally, I had the right to expect—and all the more so after the 
'Gartenlaube' article, 95 that you should include in your statement in 
the A. A. Z.e some allusion, however faint, that would obviate any 
appearance of its being a personal breach with myself and a public

repudiation of the party. The fact that your second statement" 
actually appeared alongside Blind's13  and your name served as a 
screen for his lying and fraudulence could hardly be expected to 
delight me. Incidentally, I give you my word of honour that, prior to 
their publication, I had no knowledge whatsoever of any of the 
statements made by Liebknecht in the A. A. Z. 9b 
Re 2. The day I came to your office, the two issues of the 
National-Zeitung' (the first contained the libellous excerpts and 
comments later reprinted in the Telegraph6 ) had just reached me 
from Berlin. There was utter commotion at home, and my poor 
wife was in a truly pitiful state. At the same time, I received a 
letter from Germany informing me that, besides your statements 
published in the A. A. Z., Vogt's libellous work included a letter 
of yours, from which your close relationship with Vogt was all too 
apparent, 9' and that, in particular, your name was the only one of 
any note out of which Vogt made political capital and which lent 
plausibility to his infamies in the eyes of the public. Imagine 
yourself in similar circumstances and then ask yourself whether, in 
your own case, spleen might not momentarily have prevailed over 
reason. 
Let me repeat once again that this letter has nothing to do with 
private interests. In the London lawsuit I could have you SUBPOENAED 
as a witness without your prior permission. As regards the Berlin 
lawsuit, I am in possession of letters from you which, if required, I 
could place on the record. Nor do I stand alone in this matter. 
From every side—Belgium, Switzerland, France and England— 
Vogt's libellous attack has br.ought me unexpected allies, even 
from among people who belong to quite a different school of 
thought. 
But in the first place it would anyhow be better for both parties, 
as for the cause, to act en entente. 
In the second, I must tell you frankly that I cannot resign 
myself to losing, as a result of irrelevant misunderstandings, one 
of the few men whom I have loved as friends, in the eminent 
sense of the word.

If I have failed you in any way, I am at all times ready to admit 
to my error. Nihil humani a me alienum puto? 
Finally, I understand very well that, in your present position, 
any affair such as the one under consideration could only be 
obnoxious to you. 
You, for your part, will realise that it is impossible to count you 
out altogether. 
Firstly, because Vogt is making political capital out of your name 
and pretending to have your approval in his indiscriminate 
mudslinging at a party which prides itself on counting you as one 
of its number. 
Moreover, you happen to be the only member of the former 
Cologne Central Authorityb who, between the end of 1849 and 
the spring of 1851, lived in Cologne and has since that time lived 
in London. 
Inasmuch as we have both consciously, each in his own way, out 
of the purest of motives and with an utter disregard for private 
interests, been flourishing the banner for 'la classe la plus laborieuse 
et la plus misérable m high above the heads of the philistines for 
years now, I should regard it as a contemptible offence against 
history, were we to fall out over trifles, all of them attributable to 
misunderstandings.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 23 February 1860 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Lassalle, 
I am at present having to conduct two lawsuits, one in Berlin 
and another in London,92 while, at the same time, simply working 
for a living, and am unable to write you more than a few lines. 
I must say that, having seen the book, I'm astonished at the 
'great deal of truth' you discovered in Vogt's romance," no less 
than at the pusillanimous advice you gave me. 
As for the only part that wasn't pure invention—Techow's letter,3fi 
or rather the substance thereof—I refuted this 7 years ago in a 
pamphlet which appeared in New York under the title The Knight 
of the Noble Consciousness, and to such good effect that all the 
yapping curs, who then still all belonged to the same pack, held 
their tongues and dared not utter a single word in reply. 
What I should like you to do and what would be of inestimable 
use to me, would be to find out who is the Daily Telegraph's 
correspondent in Berlin and where the brute lives, the number of 
the house and the name of the street. I believe he's a Jew called 
Meier.70 It shouldn't be at all difficult for you, in view of the 
position you occupy in Berlin, to find this out. Please advise me of 
it forthwith. 
I enclose the pamphlet on the communist trial.b 
Your 
K. M. 
P. S. As for my mistrust (you compel me to talk like statesman 
Blind, vide the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung"), that's something at 
least you can't complain of. Take, for instance, the enclosed note 
from Baltimore (United States). That note was sent to me in 
confidence. 100 The official allegations against you (among them the 
assertions of a workers' deputation from Düsseldorf) are in the

MARX TO J. M. WEBER 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 24 February 1860 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Sir, 
I find it surprising that as late as yesterday I should still have 
been without an acknowledgment from Berlin of the registered 
letter despatched to you on 13 February.'' 
Yesterday I mailed you from here—Manchester—in a second 
registered letter, the power of attorney together with seven other 
enclosures' and, with reference to the said (numbered) enclosures, 
am today taking the liberty of sending a few additional notes on 
the chief points which I consider it necessary to stress in the action 
for libel against the Berlin National-Zeitung. At the same time, I 
enclose a letter of 19 November 1852,'01 and a copy of the 
Revelations published by me in  1853.' 1 
I. a) The anonymous pamphlet ''Zur Warnung. 
In No. 41 of the Berlin National-Zeitung, leading article, 'Wie 
man radikale Flugblätter macht', -page 1, column 3, there is a 
passage which runs as follows: 
'The Marx party could very easily saddle Blind with the authorship of the 
pamphlet because and after he had expressed similar views to those contained in it 
in conversation with Marx and in an article in The Free Press. By making use of 
Blind's assertions and turns of phrase the pamphlet could be fabricated and made 
to look as if he' (i.e. Blind) 'had concocted it.'

Altogether the whole intent of this column is to depict me as the 
fabricator of the said flysheet and, at the same time, to charge me 
with the infamy of having made it look as though it had been 
concocted by  Blind. 
Before dealing with the evidence provided in the enclosures I 
sent you yesterday, it would, I think, be pertinent to give you a 
concise history of this controversy. 
In the course of its lawsuit with Vogt, the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung printed amongst other documents the following letter 
from me': 
'October 19, 1859 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill, London 
'Sir, 
'As long as I had a hand in the German Press I attacked the 
Allgem. Zeitung and the Allgem. Zeitung attacked me. However, 
this does not of course prevent me from assisting the Allgem. 
Zeitung, as far as it lies in my power, in a case in which it has in 
my view fulfilled the primary duty of the press: that of the 
denunciation of HUMBUGS. The enclosed document would be a legal 
document here in London. I do not know whether it is the same 
in Augsburg. I have procured the said document because Blind 
refused to stand by statements which he had made to me and 
others, which I passed on to Liebknecht, and which allowed the 
latter no doubts about the denunciation contained in the 
anonymous pamphlet. 
'Yours very sincerely, Dr K. Marx.' 
The document enclosed in the letter to the Allg. Zeit, and also 
printed by the latter, runs: 
'I hereby declare in the presence of Dr Karl Marx and Wilhelm Liebknecht that 
the flysheet published anonymously and without indication of the place of printing 
under the title Zur Warnung, which was reproduced in No. 7 of the Volk, had been 
'1. composed and printed in the printshop of Fidelio Hollinger, 3 Litchfield 
Street, Soho, I myself composing part of the manuscript and F. Hollinger the other 
part; 2. that it was written in Karl Blind's hand, which was known to me from Karl 
Blind's manuscripts for the Hermann, and from anonymous flysheets written by 
Karl Blind, ostensibly printed at "Frankfurt am Main", but in fact composed and 
printed at F. Hollinger's, 3 Litchfield Street, Soho; 3. that Fidelio Hollinger in 
person told me Karl Blind was the author of the flysheet Zur Warnung, directed 
against  Prof.  Vogt. August Vögele, Compositor. The authenticity of the above 
signature is attested by W. Liebknecht, Dr. K. Marx. London, 17 September 1859.' 1

(Sec Vogt's  piece,  'Mein  Prozess  gegen die"Alg. Zeitung'", Documents, 
pp. 30, 31.) 
In reply, the following letter from Karl Blind, together with the 
depositions of Hollinger and Wiehe, appeared in No. 313 of the 
Allgem. Zeitung and in the Kölnische Zeitung: 
'London, 23 Townshead Road, St John's Wood, 3 November 1859. In order to 
refute the allegation that I am the author of the flysheet Zur Warnung, I need do 
no more than make public the following document. This only in self-defence—not 
as a vindication of Karl Vogt, whose mode of action I and my friends of the 
republican party must unconditionally condemn in view of all that we have learned 
over the past six months. I can testify to the accuracy of the information provided 
by Mr Julius Lröbel to the effect that offers of money emanating from Vogt did, 
beyond doubt, arrive here, for the purpose of persuading Germans over here to 
influence the Press at home in the sense already mooted. Karl  Blind.' 
a) 'I hereby declare that the assertion of the compositor Vögele printed in the 
Allg. '/.., No. 300, to the effect that the pamphlet Zur Warnung mentioned there 
was printed in my printshop or that Herr Karl Blind was its author, is a malicious 
fabrication. Fidelia Hollinger. 3 Litchfield Street, Soho, London, November 2, 1859.' 
b) 'The undersigned, who has lived and worked in No. 3 Litchfield Street for 
the past 11 months, for his part testifies to the correctness of Herr Hollinger's 
statement. London, November 2, 1859. /. F. Wiehe, Compositor.' 
(Cf. Vogt's book, Documents, pp. 37 and 38.)  " 
To this I replied in No. 325 of the Allg. Zeit.,'' the relevant 
cutting from the A. A. Z. having been sent you in my first letter 
from London.'' 
Karl Blind, for his part, published a further rejoinder in the 
supplement to the Allg. Zeit, of 11 December, in which the editors 
declare: 
The following is the substance of Mr Karl Blind's statement: Having repeatedly 
based my testimony on the documents signed by Herr Hollinger, the printer, and Herr 
Wiehe, compositor, I declare here for the last time that the allegation (which is 
latterly put forward merely as an insinuation) that I am the author of the pamphlet 
frequently referred to is a downright untruth. The more recent statements about 
me contain distortions of the crudest sort. Let me repeat: I say this merely in 
self-defence against the Marx-Biscamp-Liebknecht camp, and not as a vindication 
of Vogt, my opposition to whom I have already voiced.' 
The editors of the Allgem.. Zeit, commented on this statement as 
follows: 
'Since the further elucidation in these pages of the above circumstances, or the 
controversy over them, has long ceased to be of any interest to the public at large, 
we would request the gentlemen concerned to desist from any further exchanges.''1

(Cf. Vogt's book, Documents, pp. 4f, 42.) 
Thus,  the files were closed for the time being. No sooner had I 
got hold of the articles in the National-Zeitung containing the 
excerpt from Vogt's pamphlet and the commentary thereon, than 
I brought out the English circular (enclosure III), addressed to the 
Editor of the London Free  Press:'  The aim was to impel K. Blind to 
bring an action for injuria against me, thus affording me the 
opportunity, first of providing legal proof in London as to the 
printing and provenance of the pamphlet Zur Warnung, and 
secondly of compelling its real author to produce incriminating 
evidence against Vogt in an English court of law. 
The immediate consequence of this circular (enclosure III), 
which I sent to Karl Blind as soon as it came off the press, was 
K. Blind's statement, which appeared in the Allgem. Zeitung of 
13 February, in the supplement to No. 44. In this statement, entitled 
Against Karl Vogt, while reiterating that he was not the 'author' of the 
and- Vogt flysheet Zur Warnung, Blind was, nevertheless, forced by 
my circular to come out with sundry arguments to the effect that 
Vogt was an agent for Bonapartist propaganda in London. This was 
the immediate consequence of my first move, namely the publication 
of the circular (enclosure III). 
In the meantime, I had procured the two affidavits of the 
compositors Vögele and Wiehe (enclosures I and II). These 
affidavits proved, firstly that my claim that the flysheet Zur 
Warnung had been printed in Hollinger's printshop and written in 
Blind's hand, was true. Secondly, that Hollinger's and Wiehe's 
depositions, published by Blind both in No. 313 of the Allg. Zeit. 
and in the Kölnische Zeitung, and again cited by him in the Allg. 
Zeit.'s supplement of 11 December, were false. Thirdly, that Blind 
and Hollinger (see enclosure II, the compositor Wiehe's affidavit) 
entered into a CONSPIRACY in order to obtain false evidence against 
me and disparage me as a liar and slanderer in the eyes of the 
public. A CONSPIRACY of this nature is a criminal offence under 
English law. Only one circumstance has restrained me from 
prosecuting Hollinger and Blind, and that is consideration for 
Blind's family. 
I sent copies of the affidavits of the two compositors Vögele and 
Wiehe (enclosures I and II) to several refugees who consort with 
Blind, to whom they showed them. The immediate  consequence  was 
Dr Schaible's statement in The Daily Telegraph of 15 February 1860, 
11 K. Marx, 'Prosecution of the Augsburg Gazette'. 

=====第99页=====
32. Marx to J. M. Weber. 24 February I860 63 
in which Schaible declares himself to be the author of the flysheet 
Zur Warnung, and accepts responsibility for the imputations 
against Vogt contained therein. (See enclosure VI.) Hence, if Vogt 
wishes to prove his innocence, he will have to begin his lawsuit all 
over again—in London. Schaible's statement to the effect that he 
is the author of the flysheet Zur Warnung in no way alters the fact 
that the flysheet was printed in Hollinger's printshop, that Blind 
caused it to be printed, that it was written in Blind's hand,that the 
depositions of Hollinger and Wiehe cited by him were false and, 
finally, that Hollinger and Blind were trying to extricate them­
selves from the snare and compromise me by giving false 
evidence. 
I need hardly point out that the two affidavits of Vögele and 
Wiehe (enclosures I and II) and Dr Schaible's statement in 
The Daily Telegraph of 15 February (enclosure VI) put you in 
possession of positive evidence as to the falsity of the National-
Zeitung's libel il adduced by me under la) of this letter. 
b) My relations with the 'Allgemeine Zeitung'. 
The two letters from the Editor of the Allgem. Zeitung to me 
dated 16 October 1859 (enclosures IV and V), 8B and my reply to 
the same, dated 19 October 1859, quoted above under la), 
represent my entire correspondence with the All. Zeitung. Hence, all 
this amounted to was my placing at the disposal of the Allgem. 
Zeit, a written document which could not fail to throw light on the 
provenance of the flysheet, the publication of which had led to 
Vogt's prosecution of the Allgem. Zeit. 
On 9 May 1859, on the occasion of a public meeting held by 
David Urquhart, K. Blind informed me of all those allegations 
against Vogt which were later repeated in Zur Warnung, although 
that pamphlet did not appear until the folloiving June. He assured me 
that he was in possession of the evidence. I did not attach much 
importance to this information, as I had already been convinced 
by Vogt's pamphlet entitled Studien zur gegenwärtigen Lage Europas, 
as well as by his association with Fazy, the 'tyrant of Geneva', and 
Fazy's association with L[ouis] Bonaparte, that Vogt was a 
Bonapartist agent. It was all the same to me, whether it was with 
good or evil intent, whether paid or unpaid. Two or three days 
after Blind had told me this, Mr Biscamp, with whom I had never 
been connected in any way, either personally or politically, was 
brought to my house by Liebknecht. Biscamp suggested that my

friends and I might care to support Das Volk, the paper he had 
founded, by making financial and literary contributions to it. 
Initially, I rejected his proposition, firstly because my time was in 
fact very much taken up, and secondly because I needed to learn 
more about Das Volk, of which there had so far been only one 
issue, before I could invite my friends to contribute to it. In this 
connection, I stressed that I had so far eschewed on principle any 
kind of participation in German newspapers published in London. 
During this talk I repeated to Liebknecht, in the presence of 
Biscamp, what Blind had told me at Urquhart's meeting. At the 
same time, I also mentioned the tendency of South Germans to 
exaggerate out of an inflated sense of their own importance. 
Subsequently, in No. 2 of the Volk of 14 May, under the heading 
'Der Reichsregent als Reichsverräter', Mr Biscamp published, on 
his own responsibility and with his own interpolations, an article 
that is quoted in Vogt's piece, Mein Prozess, etc., Documents, 
pp. 17, 18,  19. "I2 
Later, about the middle of June, at a time when I was away from 
London and staying in Manchester,"" Liebknecht received from 
Hollinger, in the latter's printshop, the proofsheet of the flysheet 
Zur Warnung, which he instantly [recognised] as being a reproduc­
tion of the information transmitted to me verbally by Blind, and 
the manuscript of which, as he learnt from the compositor Vögele, 
Blind had entrusted to Hollinger for printing. Liebknecht sent this 
proofsheet to the All. Zeit., which published it, thus laying itself 
open to Vogt's libel action. Liebknecht was all the more justified in 
taking this step (about which I knew nothing, since I was not then 
in London) because he knew that Blind, Vogt's accuser, had been 
personally invited by Vogt to collaborate in the proposed work of 
propaganda. Vis-à-vis someone who took it upon himself to pay a 
premium for all articles in the German press favourable to 
Bonaparte's plans (see Vogt's admission to that effect in his book, 3 
letter to Dr Loening, Documents, p. 36), duty demanded that such 
widely read newspapers as the Allgem. Zeit, be utilised as 'a 
warning'. 
As soon as Vogt brought his libel action against the A. A. Z. for 
reproducing the flysheet Zur Warnung, the Editor of the Allg. Zeit. 
wrote to Liebknecht urgently requesting that he produce  proof. 
Liebknecht appealed to me. I referred him to Blind and, on his 
request, went with him to see the latter, as you will perceive from

Blind's letter (enclosure VII). We failed to find Blind, who was at 
the seaside resort of St Leonards. Liebknecht wrote to him twice. 
His letters remained unanswered for weeks until, perhaps, Blind 
thought that the Augsburg lawsuit was nearing its end. (His 
calculations were thrown out by the fact that the Allg. Zeit, had 
meanwhile succeeded in getting the case adjourned.) Eventually, 
Blind replied to Liebknecht in a letter dated 8 September 
(enclosure VII), in which he says with the most barefaced 
effrontery that, 'as already remarked', he had had 'no share 
whatever in the said affair', and that he might, 'on some future 
occasion, be willing to discuss verbally ... the observations made in 
the course of private conversation'. Liebknecht brought this letter 
to me. 
I now perceived that, if Blind's tongue was to be loosened, 
forceful measures were needed. I recalled having read in the 
London Free Press of 27 May an anonymous article ('The Grand 
Duke Constantine to be King of Hungary')" which contained the 
substance of the flysheet Zur Warnung and of Blind's verbal 
communications to me. The style and content of the article never 
for a moment left me in doubt that Blind was the author of it. To 
make quite sure, I went with Liebknecht to see Mr Collet, the 
responsible editor of The Free Press. After some prevarication, he 
declared Blind to be the author of the article in question. Shortly 
afterwards, I obtained the written statement of the compositor 
Vögele to the effect that the flysheet had been composed in 
Hollinger's printshop and that the manuscript was written in 
Blind's hand. 
Liebknecht now wrote another, even longer letter to Blind, in 
which he notified him that we now had proof of his connection 
with the flysheet Zur Warnung, drew his attention, in particular, to 
the article in The Free Press, and once more requested him to 
provide such information as might be available to him. K. Blind 
did not answer, nor indeed did he once break his silence either 
before or during the legal proceedings in Augsburg. There could 
thus no longer be any doubt that K. Blind was firmly determined 
to adhere to a policy of denial and diplomatic impassivity. In these 
circumstances, I told Liebknecht that I was prepared, should the 
Allg. Zeit, ask me to do so in writing, to send it Vögele's statement 
which I had in my possession. And this is in fact what I did, after

receipt of the Allg. Zeit.'s two letters of 16 October, in my reply of 
19 October. 
The reasons which impelled me to take this step were as follows: 
Firstly: I owed it to Liebknecht, who had first heard from myself 
about Blind's remarks concerning Vogt, to provide proof that he 
was not merely repeating random allegations against third parties. 
Secondly: The Allg. Zeitung was, in my view, wholly justified in 
reprinting the pamphlet Zur Warnung, knowing as it did that its 
source was one whom Mr Vogt had personally invited to 
collaborate in his work of propaganda. The circumstance that the 
Allg. Zeit, belongs to a party hostile to myself and has always 
treated me personally in a hostile manner, even to the extent of 
repeatedly publishing the most fatuous gossip about me, in no way 
alters that view, no more than does the circumstance that, since I, 
accidentally, do not come within the jurisdiction of the Augsburg 
Court of Justice, I cannot be subpoenaed as a witness by the Allgem. 
Zeit. 
Thirdly: In the Biel 'Handels-Courier', No. 150 of 2 June, 
supplement (cf. p.  31 of the Documents in Vogt's book), Vogt had 
published a lampoon against me," obviously on the assumption 
that I was the author of the anti-Vogt article which Biscamp had 
published in the Volk on 14 May. 1' Similarly, when he took action 
against the Allg. Zeit., it was on the assumption that I was the 
author of the flysheet Zur Warnung. Blind was evidently deter­
mined to perpetuate this quiproquo,' which suited Vogt so well. 
Fourthly: and, so far as I was concerned, this was the chief  factor.  I 
wished to bring about a direct encounter between Vogt and his 
accusers, and on ground, moreover, such as would ensure a 
conclusive 'issue to the affair and leave no loopholes for either 
party. To achieve this, it was essential that I force both the real 
author and the publisher of the flysheet Zur Warnung to come out 
of their hiding places. That I had reckoned correctly is shown by 
Dr Schaible's statement' 1 (enclosure VI) and Blind's letter to the 
Allg. Zeit, of 13 February, Supplement to No. 44, already cited. 
My correspondence with the Allg. Zeit, is confined to the two 
letters (enclosures IV and V) from Dr Orges, X'J and my reply of 
19 October, cited above (under la). This sufficed for Mr Vogt 
(and the National-Zeitung) to dub me a contributor lo the 
Allg. Zeit, and to present himself to the German public as the

innocent victim of a conspiracy between the reactionaries and the 
extreme Left. 
Liebknecht has been a correspondent of the Allg. Zeit, since 
1855,  just as Mr Vogt himself was once its correspondent. 
Liebknecht will, if necessary, testify on oath to the truth, namely 
that I never made use of him to smuggle so much as a single line 
into the Allg. Zeit. His connection with the Allg. Zeit, neither has 
nor has had anything whatever to do with me. Besides, his articles 
are confined exclusively to English politics, and the views he 
upholds in the Allg. Zeit, are the same as those he has upheld and 
upholds in radical German-American papers. There is not a line 
in any of his articles which does not contain his views and which 
he could not, therefore, uphold anywhere. As regards England's 
foreign policy, Liebknecht subscribes to much the same anti-
Palmeiston views as Bucher in the Berlin National-Zeitung. As 
regards England's internal policy, he has always supported the most 
progressive English party. He has never written a line in the Allg. 
Zeit, about the tittle-tattle of the London refugees. 
So much for my alleged relations with the Allgem. Zeitung. 
II. In No. 41 of the National-Zeitung, the leader, 'Wie man 
radikale Flugblätter macht', p. 1, column 2, line 45 from the top et 
seq.. runs: 
'In May last year, a newspaper, Das Volk, was founded in London by the same 
Biscamp mentioned a short while since.... Where the money for this generously 
distributed paper came from, is known to the gods; men, however, are well aware that Marx 
and Biscamp have no money to spare.' 
Taken in conjunction with the whole of the article in No. 31, 
and likewise the leader in No. 37 of the National-Zeitung, where I 
am depicted as the 'confederate of the secret police in France and 
Germany', and especially with reference to the passage I shall 
presently cite under III, the lines I have just emoted imply that the 
money for Das Volk was procured by me dishonestly. 
As to this, I would merely observe that 
Vogt  himself,  in his pamphlet discussed by the National-Zeitung, 
quotes, on [p.] 41 of the 'Documents', which comprise the 
beginning of his book, the following editorial note in No. 6 of the 
Volk, dated 11 June: 
'We are pleased to inform our readers that K. Marx, Fr. Engels, 
Ferd. Freiligrath, W.  Wolff,  H. Heise, etc. ... are determined to 
grant their support to Das Volk.'''

Thus,  up till the middle of June, I had not as yet given any 
support to the Volk, nor up to that point had I had anything to do 
with its financial affairs. However, I might perhaps mention in 
passing that at the time Biscamp earned his living in London as a 
tutor and, throughout, edited the 'Volk' gratis. Similarly all the 
contributors, from the time the paper first came out until its 
collapse, wrote for it gratis. Hence the only production costs that 
kid to be met were those of printing and distribution. These, 
however, always markedly exceeded the paper's returns. Before I 
collaborated on the paper, losses were met by public collections 
among Germans in London. Later, I procured between £20-25 
(133 to 166 talers) which were contributed exclusively by 
Dr Borchardt, general practitioner, Dr Gumpert, ditto, Dr. 
Heckscher, ditto, Wilhelm  Wolff,  teacher, Friedrich Engels, a 
businessman (all resident in Manchester), and  myself.  Although 
some of these gentlemen were not at all in sympathy with the political 
opinions held by  myself,  Engels and W[ilhelm]  Wolff,  they all 
thought it high time to come out against Bonapartist machinations 
amongst the émigrés (and this was the Volk's principal aim). 
Lastly, the Volk left debts amounting, I think, to £8 (53 talers), 
for which Biscamp is liable, and in respect of which Hollinger 
possesses a promissory note of his. 
That is the whole of the Volk's financial history. 
As far as Mr Biscamp is concerned, he has himself declared in 
the supplement to No. 46 of the 'Allg. Zeit.' of 15 February 1860: 
'My entire political association with Mr Marx is confined to the few journalistic 
contributions he made to the weekly paper I founded, ... the Volk' 
As regards my own sources of income, all I need say here is 
that, since 1851, I have been a regular contributor to the New-York 
Tribune, the foremost English American paper, for which I have 
written not just articles, but leaders, too. The paper has some 
200,000 subscribers and pays accordingly. In addition, I have for 
several years contributed to the Cyclopaedia Americana published 
by Mr Dana, one of the editors of the New-York Tribune. I hope to 
obtain from Mr Dana in New York a letter relating to these 
circumstances in time for the court proceedings.3 However, should 
this letter fail to arrive soon enough, I need only refer you to 
Mr Ferdinand Freiligrath, MANAGER of the General Bank of Switzerland, 
2 Royal Exchange Buildings, London, who has for many years been 
good enough to cash my bills on America.

The effrontery of Vogt and his ally the National-Zeitung in 
casting aspersions on me because of my participation in a 
newspaper which did not pay a penny, is all the greater for the fact 
that, on p. 226 of his book discussed in the National-Zeitung, this 
same Vogt openly admits that 'furthermore', too, 'he would obtain 
the money' required for his purposes 'wherever he could lay hands on 
it'. 
III. In No. 37 of the National-Zeitung, leader entitled 'Karl Vogt 
und die "Allgemeine Zeitung"', page 1, column 2, line 22 from top, 
et seq., the National-Zeitung says — and this passage, which I now 
quote, I consider to be the most incriminating of all from the point 
of view of the libel action: 
'Vogt reports on p. 136 et seq.: Among the refugees of 1849 the term Brimstone 
Gang, or the name of the Bristlers, referred to a number of people who, originally 
scattered throughout Switzerland, France and England, gradually congregated in 
London, where they revered Herr Marx as their visible leader.... One of the chief 
occupations of the Brimstone Gang was to compromise people at home in Germany in such a 
way that they were forced to pay money so that the gang should keep secret the fact of their 
being compromised. Not just one, but hundreds of letters were written to people in 
Germany, threatening to denounce them for complicity in this or that act of 
revolution unless a certain sum of money had been received at a specified 
address by a given date.... The "proletarians"' (as whose chief 1 am portrayed) 
'filled the columns of the reactionary press in Germany with their denunciations of those 
democrats who did not subscribe to their views. They became the confederates of the 
secret police in Germany and France.' 
As regards this infamous passage, which the National-Zeitung 
takes over lock, stock and barrel from Mr Vogt, thus ensuring its 
circulation among its 9,000 subscribers, I would remark: 
Firstly: As I have already mentioned in my first letter to you,a it 
will now be incumbent upon the National-Zeitung to produce from 
amongst these 'hundreds' of threatening letters, one solitary letter 
or one solitary line of which I or any person known to be 
connected with me was the author. 
Secondly: I repeat what I have already said in my first letter,1 ' 
namely that, since July 1849, I have never written for any German 
paper except the Neue Oder-Zeitung of Breslau' (1855), at a time 
when it was under the editorship of Dr Eisner and Dr Stein. As 
the issues of the paper will themselves reveal, and as Messers 
Eisner and Stein will assuredly be willing to testify, I never 
thought it worth my while to devote so much as a single word to 
the emigration.

As for the columns in the 'reactionary press' which I and my 
friends filled with 'denunciations', it will be incumbent on the 
National-Zeitung to produce just one such column. On the other 
hand, it is both true and demonstrable that a large proportion of 
the German émigrés in London systematically filled German 
newspapers of all complexions with their hostile gossip about me 
for years on end. I have never made use of my connections, either 
with the New-York Tribune, or with the Chartist papers, or with 
The Free Press, for the purpose of retaliation. 
As for my 'alliance with the secret police in France and 
Germany', Hörfei, a notorious French police spy, was the chief 
agent in Paris for Kinkel's émigré association. He in turn was 
connected with Beckmann, who was both a Prussian police spy and 
a correspondent of the Kölnische Zeitung. Again, one Engländer, 
likewise a notorious French police spy, was for a considerable time 
the Paris correspondent of Ruge's clique. This was how 'the 
democratic émigrés in London' succeeded in setting up, all 
unwittingly, of course, an 'alliance with the secret police in France 
and Germany '. 
Finally Vogt, and with him the National-Zeitung, mentions 
'a number of people who, among the refugees of 1849, went by the name of the 
Brimstone Gang or Bristlers and who. originally scattered throughout Switzerland, 
France and England, gradually congregated in London, where they revered Herr 
Marx as their visible leader'. 
This passage I regard as of secondary importance. Nevertheless, 
with a view to elucidating and unmasking the libellous intentions 
of Vogt and the National-Zeitung, I would make the following 
observations: 
The Brimstone Gang was the name given to a society of young 
German refugees who lived in Geneva in 1849/50 and set up their 
headquarters in the Café de l'Europe in that city. This was neither 
a political nor a socialist society but, in the true sense of the term, 
a 'society of young blades' who were seeking to overcome the first 
pangs of exile by indulging in mad escapades. It consisted of 
Eduard Rosenblum, medical student; Max Cohnheim, shop assistant; 
Korn,  chemist and pharmacist; Becker" engineer, and L. S. Bork-
heim,  student and artilleryman. I had never seen any of these 
gentlemen save Mr Becker, and him only once, at the Democratic 
Congress in Cologne in 1848. 104 In mid-1850 all the members of 
11 Max Joseph Becker

the society except for Korn were expelled from Geneva. The 
group scattered to the four winds. 
I am obliged to Mr Borkheim, now manager of a big 
commercial enterprise in the City (44 Mark Lane), for the above 
notes concerning a society of which I had been hitherto entirely 
ignorant.*'' I first made Mr Borkheim's acquaintance only about a 
fortnight since, after I had written to him asking for information.' 2 
So much for the Brimstone Gang. 
Now, as regards the Bristlers, this was a term of abuse which one 
Abt, at present secretary to the Bishop of Freiburg,1 ' applied to the 
Workers' Educational Association in Geneva. For Abt had been 
declared dishonourable by a general refugee society which com­
prised members (refugees) of the Workers' Educational Associa­
tion as well as former members of the Frankfurt Parliament. To 
avenge  himself,  he wrote a pamphlet, in which he christened the 
Workers' Educational Association 'Biirstenheimers' [roughly: 'Bris­
tlers'] because the Association's President at the time was a brush 
maker [ Bürstenmacher] by the name of Sauern heimer.'"'' There was 
never any kind of connection between this Workers' Educational 
Association in Geneva and myself or the communist society in 
London to which I belonged.""' In the summer of 1851, two of its 
members, Schily, a lawyer now in Paris, and P. Imandt, now 
professor at the training college in Dundee, were expelled by the 
Swiss authorities and made their way to London where they joined 
the Workers' Society then headed by Willich and Schapper'"'; this, 
however, they left a few months later. Their relationship to me 
was that of compatriots and old personal friends. The only person 
in Geneva with whom I ever had anything to do since my 
expulsion from Prussia (1849) was Dronke, now a businessman in 
Liverpool. 
Thus,  the names Brimstone Gang and Bristlers, like the two quite 
distinct societies they denoted, were exclusive to Geneva. There was 
never any connection between the two societies and  myself.  They first 
became known in London through the leaders in the National-
Zeitung'' excerpts from which were reprinted by a London paper, 
The Daily Telegraph.' 
Thus,  my connection with the 'Brimstone Gang' and the 
'Bristlers' is a deliberate fabrication on the part of Vogt, the 
National-Zeitung having made itself his mouthpiece.

IV. The National-Zeitung, No. 41, leader 'Wie man radikale 
Flugblätter macht', page 1, column 1, line 49 from the top, says: 
To begin with, Vogt simply alludes to the 'party of the proletarians' 'under Marx'. 
In this way I am identified with the 'party of the proletarians' and 
hence everything the paper says about that party also applies to 
myself personally. 
Now, further on in the same article, column 2, line 19 from the 
top et seq., we read: 
'In this way a conspiracy of the most infamous sort was devised in 1852, which 
aimed at damaging the Swiss workers' associations by manufacturing counterfeit paper 
money on a massive scale. (See Vogt for further details.) This conspiracy would 
have caused the greatest difficulties for the Swiss authorities if it had not been 
uncovered in time.' 
And, further on in the same column, line 33 from top: 
'The party of the "proletarians" nourishes a particular hatred for Switzerland', 
etc. 
The National-Zeitung must have known from the Cologne 
communist trial of October 18522  (just as Vogt knew from my 
Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial) that I never had 
anything to do with Cherval, who is said to have been responsible 
for the machinations in Switzerland in 1852 (Mr Schapper of 
5 Percy Street, Bedford Square, London, with whom Cherval had 
connections before the Cologne trial, is prepared to provide all the 
necessary information on the subject); that during the communist 
trial in Cologne I denounced Cherval, through the medium of 
counsel, as an ally of Stieber's; that, according to the depositions 
wrested from Stieber, when Cherval was in Paris in 1851, hatching 
the complot franco-allemand under Stieber's direction, 108 he [Cher­
val] belonged to a society hostile to  myself.  The National-Zeitung 
knew from Vogt's book, which it made the subject of two leading 
articles, that, after the Cologne trial was over, I had also 
denounced Cherval as a mouchard'' in the work, Revelations 
Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, which I sent to 
Switzerland for printing. During the Cologne trial, when Cherval 
arrived in London, ostensibly after escaping from prison in Paris, 
but in fact as a mouchard, [he] was welcomed with open arms by 
the Workers' Society, then run by Willich and Schapper, only to be 
expelled in consequence of the cross-examination to which, at my 
•' police spy

32. Marx to J. M. Weber. 24 February I860 73 
instigation, counsel (notably Schneider II) subjected Stieber re 
Cherval during the proceedings in Cologne. 
Hence it was the most barefaced and deliberate libel on the part of 
Vogt and his associate, the National-Zeitung, to make me responsi­
ble for the alleged activities in Switzerland of an individual 
notoriously my enemy, whom I had exposed and persecuted. Vogt 
speaks of Marx's associates in Geneva with whom Cherval 
consorted. At the present time, as in 1852, I have no connections 
with anyone whomsoever in Switzerland. 
Let me repeat what I told you in an earlier lettera : On 
15 September 1850 my friends and I disassociated ourselves from 
one section of the London Central Authority of the then extant 
German communist society (called 'Communist League'),''' namely 
from that section which, under Willich's leadership, took part in 
the (come to that, highly innocuous and puerile) revolution-arid 
conspiracy-mongering of the 'Democratic Emigration'. We re­
moved the Central Authority to Cologne and entirely suspended 
all correspondence with any part of the Continent except for 
Cologne. As the Cologne trial was to show, that correspondence 
contained nothing of a criminal nature. From the spring of 1851 
onwards, immediately after the arrest of individual members of 
the society in Cologne, we (the London section of the society) broke 
off every single connection with the Continent. The only man—not 
personally known to me, by the by—with whom I continued to 
correspond about ways and means of defending the arrested men, was a 
friend of theirs, Mr Bermbach, former deputy of the Frankfurt 
National Assembly. My friends in London met once a week for the 
purpose of frustrating the police machinations unblushingly 
resorted to and daily renewed by Stieber. In mid-November 
(1852),  after the conclusion of the Cologne trial, I, with the 
consensus of my friends, declared the 'Communist League' 
disbanded, nor, since that time, have I belonged either to a secret or 
to a public society. Ferdinand Freiligrath, who belonged to the 
communist society, was in Cologne from the autumn of 1848 until 
the spring of 1851, and has lived in London from the spring of 
1851 until the present, can testify to the absolute truth of the 
foregoing account. For that matter, sufficient proof is provided by 
the enclosed letter of 19 November 1852, postmarked London and 
Manchester, which my friend F. Engels has discovered amongst 
his old papers. 1'

I arranged for the enclosed pamphlet,3  quoted by Vogt and the 
National-Zeitung, to be printed in Boston (in America) after the 
original edition of 2,000 copies published by Schabelitz in Basle 
had been confiscated on the Baden border. From this, no less than 
from the Stieber-Eichhoff case, 44 when it eventually comes up in 
Berlin, you will see that the communist society, to which I 
belonged until mid-November 1852, committed no offence what­
soever on which to base an indictment; also that, on the other 
hand, in spite of the very restricted means at our disposal, my 
London friends and I so effectively demolished the web of 
intrigue spun by the police that in the end they actually proposed 
to secure the prisoners' conviction—as Hirsch, once Stieber's agent 
and now in gaol in Hamburg, relates in his confessions in the New-
Yorker Criminal-Zeitung of 22 April 1853 b—by getting Hirsch to 
travel to Cologne under the name of Haupt, and perjure himself 
in the name of the Haupt he was impersonating. This coup was on 
the point of being perpetrated when, Hirsch says, Mr von 
Hinckeldey wrote saying that, 
'The State Prosecutor hopes that thanks to the happy constitution of the jury it 
will be possible to get a verdict of guilty even without extraordinary measures, and he' 
(Hinckeldey) 'therefore asks you not to trouble yourselves further.' 
It goes without saying that the only value the enclosed pamphlet 
would have in a court of law would lie in the light it throws on my 
struggle with Stieber, Hinckeldey and the then Prussian police 
system. The societies therein alluded to have belonged to the 
realm of history for years now. 
V. Finally, in order to leave you in no doubt as to the 
significance to me of the libel suit against the National-Zeitung, I 
will allude very briefly to the repercussions here in London of the 
leaders in the National-Zeitung. 
The Daily Telegraph (a newspaper appearing in London) of 
6 February 1860 published an article of two and a half columns 
under the heading The Journalistic Auxiliaries of Austria. 
This article, dated Frankfurt am Main, but in fact written in 
Berlin, is, as the most fleeting comparison will reveal, a mere 
paraphrase if not, in part, a word for word translation of the two 
leaders in Nos. 37 and 41 of the Nat. Zeit, on account of which I 
am suing it. I shall be sending you the said issue of the Daily

Telegraph within the next few days. In this Telegraph article, as in 
the National-Zeitung, firstly, my friends and I are portrayed as 
'confederates of the secret police'; and, secondly, there is a word

published in the Daily Telegraph of 13 February 1860. The 
following is a literal translation (I shall let you have the original in 
a few days' time): 
' Frankfort-on-the-Maine, Feb. 8. I shall not be long in disposing of the remarks 
addressed to you by Dr Marx in reply to a communication of mine. The letter 
addressed to you by him has been simply misdirected. If the learned gentleman 
had offered his observations to Dr Vogt  himself,  or to one of the hundred German 
editors who quoted the book of Dr Vogt, his behaviour would only have been what 
the case seems to demand. As it is, however, Dr Marx, leaving unrefuted the 
numerous accusations raised against him in his own country, prefers cooling his 
anger by attacking the only English paper that has received into its columns a 
statement printed and reprinted before in almost every German city of any magnitude. 
The learned gentleman seems to be utterly oblivious of the fact that he has not the 
slightest right to complain of the publication of a certain piece of unpleasant 
intelligence by an English paper, so long as he does not deem it convenient to call to 
account the originators and propagators of the mischief in his fatherland. I conclude these 
lines by declaring my readiness to acknowledge the untruthfulness of the 
statements put forth in the communication alluded to the moment Dr Marx will 
have satisfied the world of their falsity. If he is in possession of the evidence 
required for such a purpose, nothing would be easier for him than to accomplish so 
desirable an object. There are at least fifty German cities at his disposal where he will 
have to institute lawsuits, and bring the editors to condign punishment. Unless he 
chooses to pursue this course, it is not the duty of the correspondent of an English 
paper to retract what he did not assert, but merely repeated on the uncontradicted 
authority of the most  respectable  sources.' 
Merely en passant I would draw attention to the exaggerations 
with which the Daily Telegraph's Berlin correspondent (a Jew by 
the name of Meier,7" I believe) endeavours to cloak his plagiarisms 
from the National-Zeitung. First there are a hundred German 
editors, then many thousands (in other words, as many editors as 
there are towns of any importance in Germany) and, finally, at 
il K. Marx, 'To the Editor of The Daily Telegraph'.

least fifty editors whom I would have to sue. Incidentally, by the 
most respectable sources, he means his only source, the Berlin 
National-Zeitung. 
Again merely in passing, I should mention that in my letter of 
6 February to the Editor of the Daily Telegraph, a letter which, as 
he wrote and told me  himself,  he forwarded to his German 
correspondent, I had disclosed to the Editor of the Telegraph, and 
hence also to his correspondent, that I intended to bring a libel 
action against the Berlin 'National-Zeitung'. 
What seems to me the one point of crucial importance here is 
that the Daily Telegraph, skulking behind its correspondent, is 
refusing me any kind of satisfaction until I have taken action against a 
German paper. It invokes the 'respectable' authority of the 
National-Zeitung, which was alone in printing, in this context, the 
very assertions made by it. 
You can imagine what a scandal the Telegraph article created in 
London. For that scandal I have the National-Zeitung to thank. If 
only for my family's sake, I shall have to bring an ACTION FOR LIBEI. 
against the Telegraph, for which the necessary retaining fees will 
amount in this country to at least £200—before the case has been 
decided. The depths of depravity to which Vogt is capable of 
descending will have been apparent to you from the dastardly 
insinuation that I owed my alleged connections with the Neue 
Preussische Zeitung to the fact of my wife's being the sister of the 
former Prussian minister, von Westphalen. 
I now await by return of post (unless a letter has been despatched 
to me previously) notification that you have received the following 
letters: 
1. Letter from London of 13 February, together with a 
retaining fee of 15 talers. 
2. Letter from Manchester of 21 February, together with power 
of attorney and seven enclosures. 
3. This letter from Manchester of 24 February, enclosing the 
pamphlet Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne 
and a letter which I wrote Engels on 19 November 1852, 
postmarked in London and Manchester.

Dear Liebknecht, 
You should let Schapper have a look at Vogt's book.3 Go and see 
him. He will tell you what I've written to him.42 
According to the letter from my lawyer in Berlin,1' which arrived 
yesterday, things are going well. The information I sent him 
included what was required in respect of  yourself.  Deal thoroughly 
with all that part of Vogt's book relating to you, so that I can have it 
at any time. But stick absolutely rigidly to the FACTS. 
Next, it is essential that the resolution backing me and censuring 
Vogt, adopted by the Workers' Educational Society on 6 February 
I860 1 and signed by the Society's chairman,'1  should be authenti­
cated immédiatement (i.e. the signature) before the magistrate. So, 
have a word with Weber 1 if necessary.

Dear Schapper, 
I have written to Liebknecht asking him to let you have a look at 
Vogt's book, a so that you can see for yourself how important the 
Berlin lawsuit against the National-Zeitung (the one against the 
Telegraph1 ' is secondary) is to the historical vindication of our party 
and its subsequent position in Germany. Yesterday I had a letter 
from my lawyer in Berlin ' from which I gather that Mr Zabel of 
the National-Zeitung will probably atone for his pro-Vogtian zeal 
by becoming intimately acquainted with the interior of a penal 
establishment. My lawyer thinks it important that you should make 
the following affidavit, 109 as soon as possible, or one along similar 
lines,  before a London magistrate (the one in Bow Street is our man; 
he already knows Liebknecht, who could go with you): 
*'I declare herewith, that, in the year, etc., Cherval (alias 
Cramer, etc.) was introduced by myself into the London Branch of 
the German friendly society called "Der Bund" (the Union) 63 (a 
society, by the by, which has ceased to exist long time since); that 
in etc. 1848 the said passed through Cologne where he had a 
short interview with me, which I did not even mention to Dr Karl 
Marx. Cherval being an individual utterly unknown to Dr K. M.; 
that in 1851/52 during his stay at Paris, Cherval belonged to, and 
corresponded with that branch of the German friendly society 
called "Der Bund" which at the time was directed by myself and 
Mr Willich, now living at Cincinnati, U. St.; that, during the 
autumn of 1852, after his return from Paris to London, Cherval 
entered the public German Working-men's Society, called "Der 
Arbeiterbildungsverein", of which he had formerly been a 
member and which, at the time, was directed by myself and the 
above said Mr Willich; that consequent upon the revelations 
publicly made at Cologne against Cherval during the trial of

Dr Becker' and others, and upon other information derived from 
other sources, the said Cherval was publicly expulsed from the 
German Workmen Club above named, and, soon after, disappeared 
from London.'* 
Engels sends you his kindest regards; he will, by the by, be 
coming down to London himself sometime in the spring. I beg 
you to lose no time.

MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 29 February 1860 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Freiligrath, 
Your letter really warmed my heart, for there are very few 
people with whom I strike up a friendship, but when I do I 
adhere to it. My friends of 1844 continue to be my friends today. 
As to the strictly official part of your letter, however, this is based 
on some grave misapprehensions, hence the following by way of 
clarification: 
1. The Eichhoff-Stieber case44 
The 'material' which I passed on to Juch (on which occasion I 
also pointed out to him that there were two reasons why he and 
Eichhoff did not deserve my support: firstly, the way in which they 
had referred to the Cologne trial 2 in the Hermann1 '; secondly, my 
conviction that Eichhoff is simply a tool of the ex-police official 
Duncker, who is seeking to avenge himself on Stieber as Vidocq 
once did on Gisquet in Paris; nevertheless, I would, I said, do all 
in my power to help overthrow Stieber and bring him to book, if 
only to avenge the death of my friend, Dr Daniels), this 'material', 
I say, amounts to the following: 
a [K. Eichhoff,] 'Stieber', Hermann, Nos. 36-38, 40, 42, 43; 10, 17, 24 September, 
8, 22, 29 October 1859. 

=====第117页=====
36. Marx to Ferdinand Freiligrath. 29 February 1860 81 
I gave Juch a copy of the Revelations Concerning the Communist 
Trial in Cologne; N. B. this publication of mine, which was printed 
first in Switzerland and later in Boston, was cited by Vogt as a 
well-known book, and was in no sense 'something secret'. 
I told Juch that it contained all I knew. 
Finally, I pointed out to him that Lewald (Eichhoff's defence 
counsel) must examine Hirsch, who was in jail in Hamburg, as a 
witness. This was done. Hirsch has now admitted on oath that the 
'minute-book' was a Prussian fabrication and an indictable offence 
in every other respect. 
Hence the 'revelations' produced by the trial, thanks to my 
'material', exonerate the former members of the League63  from any 
semblance of legal culpa'' and 'expose' the Prussian police system, 
which, once installed as a result of the 'Cologne trial' and the 
infamous pusillanimity of the Cologne jury, grew to be such a 
power in Prussia that it has finally become intolerable to the 
bourgeois themselves and even to Auerswald's ministry. Voilà tout b 
Besides, I'm astonished that you could even imagine that I might 
hand the police anything on a platter. I would remind you of 
letters sent from Cologne (1849-50),"° which you knew about and 
in which I was reproached in so many words with having dragged 
my feet too much (at the time, I did so for very good reasons, 
certainly not out of concern for myself) in regard to agitation by 
the League. 
2. My lawsuit against the 'National-Zeitung' 
I would point out  d'abord 1 that, after the 'League' had been 
disbanded at my behest in November 1852, I never belonged to any 
society again, whether secret or public; that the party, therefore, in 
this wholly ephemeral sense, ceased to exist for me 8 years ago. 
The lectures on political economy I gave, after the appearance of 
my book' 1 (in the autumn of 1859), to a few picked working men, 
amongst whom were also former members of the League, had 
nothing in common with an exclusive society—less even than, say, 
Mr Gerstenberg's lectures to the Schiller Committee.'5 
You will recall that the leaders of the fairly ramified Communist 
Club in New York1" (among them Albrecht Komp, MANAGER of the 
General Bank, 44 Exchange Place, New York) sent me a letter, 
which passed through your hands, and in which it was tentatively 
suggested that I should reorganise the old League. A whole year 
passed before I replied,"'2 and then it was to the effect that since

1852 I had not been associated with any association and was firmly 
convinced that my theoretical studies were of greater use to the 
working class than my meddling with associations which had now 
had their day on the Continent. Because of this 'inactivity' I was 
thereupon repeatedly and bitterly attacked, if not by name at least 
by inference, in Mr Scherzer's London Neue Zeit. 
When Mr Levy came over from Düsseldorf (for the first time), 
on which occasion he frequently called on you, too, he actually 
proffered me a factory operatives' insurrection, no less, in 
Iserlohn, Solingen, etc. I told him bluntly that I was against such 
futile and dangerous folly. I further informed him that I no longer 
belonged to any 'league'; nor, in view of the danger presented to 
the people in Germany [by] such a connection, could I have 
anything to do with it, no matter what the circumstances. Levy 
returned to Düsseldorf, and as I was shortly afterwards informed 
by letter, spoke very highly of you while denouncing my 
'doctrinaire' indifference."' 
Since 1852, then, I have known nothing of 'party* in the sense 
implied in your letter. Whereas you are a poet, I am a critic and 
for me the experiences of 1849-52 were quite enough. The 
'League', like the société des saisons in Paris ' M and a hundred other 
societies, was simply an episode in the history of a party that is 
everywhere springing up naturally out of the soil of modern 
society. 
There are two things I have to prove in Berlin (I mean with 
regard to this hoary and outdated business of the League): 
First, that since 1852 no such society has existed of which / have 
been a member, 
next, that in as much as he slings Telleringian mud, and worse, 
at the communist society that existed up till November 1852, 
Mr Vogt is a scoundrelly and infamous slanderer. 
As to the latter point, you, of course, are a witness and your letter 
to Ruge (summer of 1851) proves that, during the period with 
which we are solely concerned here, you regarded attacks of this kind 
as being directed against  yourself,  too. 
You were a co-signatory to the statements in the Morning 
Advertiser, the Spectator, the Examiner, the Leader, and the People's 
Paper:' One copy of these is on the court files in Cologne. 
Nor did you raise the least objection when I reverted to this 
matter in my Revelations (p. 47) {Boston edition).1'

Again, your name appears—as treasurer—in the appeal we 
published requesting contributions for the convicted men.115 
But there's hardly any need to go into all this again. 
What is imperative, however, is that my lawyer in Berlin3  should 
be sent the following letter from me to Engels, this being a legal 
document by virtue of the fact that it was sent without an envelope 
and bears both London and Manchester postmarks. 
'London, 19 November 1852 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
'Dear Engels, 
'Last Wednesday,1 ' at my suggestion, the League disbanded; 
similarly the continued existence of the League on the Continent 
was declared to be no longer expedient. In any case, since the arrest 
of Bürgers-Röser, it had to all intents and purposes already ceased 
to exist there. Enclosed a statement for the English papers, 1 etc. In 
addition I am writing, for the Lithographierte  Korrespondenz,  an article' 
(instead, I wrote the pamphlet published by Schabelitz' 1) 'on the dirty 
tricks  played by the  police,  etc., and also an appeal to America for money 
for the prisoners and their families. Treasurer Freiligrath. Signed by 
all our people.' (The few remaining lines are irrelevant.) 
'Your K. M.'J 
In the case of such a document I cannot, of course, delete any 
names. This is the only document in which, with a view to 
substantiating a fact, namely the disbandment of the League, I make 
use of your name, in as much as it happens to occur in a letter 
written by me in 1852. I cannot see how that would compromise 
you. 
I should like to use one letter of yours, written in 1851, for the 
pamphlet which is to appear after the hearing.' Nothing in the 
least compromising about it, legally speaking. But since this will 
take many weeks, I shall arrange matters with you by word of 
mouth.

From  the  above  it follows that: 
The 'meetings, resolutions  and  transactions  of the  party' since 
1852 belong  to the  realm  of fantasy,  as you  might have known  in 
any case without  my  telling  you and,  judging  by a  great many  of 
your letters  to me,  evidently  did  know. 
The only activity  in which  I persisted after  1852, for as  long  as it 
continued necessary—i.e. until  the end of  1853  — in company with 
a few  kindred spirits  on the  other side  of the  Atlantic,  was of the 
kind described  by Mr  Ludwig Simon  in 1851 in the  Tribune  as a 
•SYSTEM  OF MOCKERY  AND  CONTEMPT', 111' and was directed against the 
emigration's democratic humbug  and  revolution-mongering. Your anti-
Kinkel poem,'1  no less than your correspondence with  me  during 
that time, prove that  you and I  were entirely  d'accord. 
However, this  has  nothing  to do  with  the  lawsuits. 
Teilering, Bangya, Fleury,  etc.,  never belonged  to the  'League  . 
That dirt  is thrown  up by  storms, that  no revolutionary period 
smells  of attar  of roses, that even,  at times,  one  becomes  a target 
for all  manner  of garbage, goes without saying.  Aut, aut!" 
However, when  one  considers  the  tremendous efforts made  to 
combat  us by the  whole  of the  official world,  who did not so  much 
skim  as wade through  the  depths  of the  Code pénal  in order  to 
ruin us;  when  one  considers  the  slanderous attacks  of the 
'democracy  of folly' which could never forgive  our  party  for 
having more brains  and  character than  itself;  when  one  knows  the 
parallel history  of all the  other parties; when  one  finally asks 
oneself what  can  actually  be held (other than,  say, the  infamies 
refutable  in court,  of a  Vogt  or a  Tellering) against  the  party  as a 
whole,  one can  only conclude that what distinguishes  it in  this,  the 
nineteenth century,  is its  purity. 
Can one  escape  the  filth  in bourgeois intercourse  or TRADE?  But 
in the  latter,  the  filth  has its  natural habitat. Example:  Sir 
R. Carden, vide  the  Parliamentary Blue Book  on corrupt election 
practices.' Example:  Mr  Klapka, concerning whose personal details 
I am now  very well informed.  Kl. is not one  whit better,  and 
possibly worse, than Bangya whom,  by the by, he and  Kossuth 
have been sheltering  to this  day in  Constantinople, despite  his 
heroic deeds  in Circassia  and  despite  my  public denunciation/1

simply because he knew too much about them. As a person Bangya 
was more decorous than Kl. He kept a mistress; for years Klapka 
allowed a mistress to keep him, etc. The filth of a Tellering may 
well be counterbalanced by the purity of a Beta, and even the 
dissoluteness of a Reiff finds its equivalent in the chastity of a 
Paulaa who, at any rate, was not a member of the party, nor made 
any pretence so to be. 
The honourable meanness or mean honourableness of solvent 
(and this subject only to highly ambiguous provisos, as every trade 
crisis goes to show) morality is to my mind not one whit superior 
to disrespectable meanness, from the taint of which neither the 
first Christian communities, nor the Jacobin Club, nor our 
erstwhile 'League' could remain entirely free. But bourgeois 
intercourse accustoms one to the loss of one's sense of respectable 
meanness or mean respectability. 
3. The special matter of Vogt and Blind. 
Following the affidavits made by Vögele' 8 and Wiehe b (as 
everyone knows, a false affidavit entails transportation) and 
following the statements extracted in consequence thereof—from 
Blind in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung c and from Dr Schaible 
(Daily Telegraph of 15 February) d—the affair has resolved itself to 
the extent that your testimony relating to this point has now been 
rendered quite superfluous. As regards the Blind case, my only 
problem is an embarras de richesses. 
In this matter I approached Ernest Jones, with whom I had not 
consorted for two years on account of his foolish, but now publicly 
disavowed, attitude to Bright, Gilpin, etc.117  I approached him 
firstly because he, like many others, some of them quite unknown 
to me, let me know spontaneously, immediately after the Telegraph 
of 6 February had appeared, how profoundly indignant he was at 
the infamous conduct of Vogt, who had had the effrontery to 
assert that the Communist League had been founded and, from 
1849 to 1852, had operated, with one end in view, namely to extort 
money from compromised people in Germany by threatening to denounce 
them;  who traced back my 'connection' with the Neue Preussische 
Zeitung to my 'relationship by marriage' to von Westphalen, etc. 
(For my wife's sake I was glad of this demonstration, since one can

hardly expect ladies  to grow  a political thick skin; moreover,  it is 
precisely  by  catastrophes that they  are  accustomed  to  gauge 
whether  a friendship  is in  earnest  or in  jest); secondly, because  I 
was deterred  by  consideration,  not for  Blind,  but for his  wife  and 
children, from discussing  his  case, most invidious from  a legal point  of 
view, with  a true-blue English lawyer.  It was  this same consideration 
that deterred  me  from sending  the  English circular11  to the 
Morning Advertiser  or to any  English daily other than  the 
Telegraph. 
What Jones told  me was  this: 
'You  can  go—and  I myself will  go with you—to  the  magistrate 
and at once take out a  WARRANT  for Blind's arrest for  CONSPIRACY  on 
the strength  of Wiehe's affidavit.  But  bear  in mind that this  is a 
criminal  ACTION  and  that, once  it has  been reported,  you  will have 
no power  to withdraw  it.' 
I then asked Jones (who  can  tell you  this all over again;  he lives 
at 5 Cambridge Place, Kensington,  W.)  whether  it wasn't possible 
for him to  warn Blind  and  thus induce  him to  make  a statement 
that would include,  not  only everything  he  knew about Vogt,  but 
also an admission  of the  falsity  of the  depositions adduced  by him 
in the A. A. Z. h 
Jones replied: 
'In CONSPIRACY,  and hence criminal,  CASES,  any attempt by the advocate 
to COMPOUND  OR  BRING ABOUT  A COMPROMISE  would itself be punishable 
under criminal  law.' 
Jones will  act as my  COUNCIL  in the  Telegraph affair. 
After Jones's pronouncements,  I found myself  in a  most 
awkward  and  embarrassing situation,  for, on the one  hand,  I owed 
it to my  family  to  compel  the  Telegraph  to  recant;  on the  other,  I 
did not  wish  to take  any  steps that might  be  legally injurious  to 
Blind's family.  As an  expedient  I sent  to Blind's friend Louis Blanc 
a copy  of  both affidavits  and a  letter, part  of which reads  (I 
quote): 
'NOT  FOR MR  BUND  WHO  HAS RICHLY DESERVED  IT, BUT FOR HIS  FAMILY,  I SHOULD 
REGRET BEING FORCED  TO  LODGE  A CRIMINAL ACTION AGAINST  HIM.' 
This last move evoked Schaible's statement  (POOR DEAR),  just  as the 
printed circular,3 which  I had  sent  to Blind immediately after  it 
came  out, had  evoked  his  anti-Vogt statement  the  self-same  day in 
" K. Marx,  'Prosecution  of the  Augsburg  Gazette'.  - b K. Blind's statements  in the 
Allgemeine  Zeitung,  Nos. 313 and 345, 9  November  and 11  December  1859.

the A. A. Z:' Blind may have the hole-and-corner cunning of a 
man from Baden, but he had forgotten that he was confronting 
someone who would be ruthless the moment his own honour, or 
that of his party, was at stake. 
This is how matters stand: The action against The Daily 
Telegraph has been instituted but my SOLICITOR will delay matters 
until after the case against the National-Zeitung has been decided. 
Had Schaible told me frankly what he knew against Vogt (Schaible 
is Blind's FAME ELEPHANT, of course), it would have been wholly 
unnecessary for me, after his statement had appeared in the 
Telegraph of 15 February, to lodge the affidavits in London. In 
Berlin, where it will have no legal repercusions on Blind, this will, 
of course, be unavoidable. Whether Schaible was the real (literary) 
author of the 'flysheet' b or not does nothing to alter the facts 
established in the affidavits, namely that the depositions adduced 
by Blind in the A. A. ZS were false, that they were obtained by 
means of a CONSPIRACY, that the flysheet had been printed in 
Hollinger's printshop, written in Blind's hand and handed over by 
him to Hollinger to be printed. 
Distasteful though these matters certainly are, they are not 
more distasteful than European history as a whole since 1851, 
with all its achievements in the diplomatic, military and literary 
fields. 
'For all that and all that','1 the philistine upon me will always be a 
better device for us than / beneath the philistine.c 
I have frankly stated my views, with which I trust you are 
largely in agreement. Moreover, I have tried to dispel the 
misunderstanding arising out of the impression that by 'party' I 
meant a 'League' that expired eight years ago, or an editorial 
board that was disbanded twelve years ago.' By party, I meant the 
party in the broad historical sense. 
With sincere assurances of my friendship,

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 3 March I860 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Dear Lassalle, 
I am replying by return, albeit briefly (though, I hope, 
intelligibly), for I am up to my eyes in work connected with the 
two lawsuits. 
1. Ad vocemb: My action against the 'National-Zeitung'. 
You cannot give an opinion on the possible outcome of this 
action since you don't know, on the one hand, what papers I have 
in my possession, or, on the other, how totally unfounded Vogt's 
lies are. But you ought to have favoured the attack from the very 
outset. The second action is against the Daily Telegraph in London, 
for having enlarged on and reproduced the articles in the N.-Z.'' 
The Telegraph is the vilest daily paper in London, which is saying 
a great deal, but it is assuredly not small. It has the largest 
circulation of all the London daily papers. Is specially subsidised 
by Palmerston. This is the reason why it devotes so much space to 
the mud slung at me. 
I am enclosing my Knight of the Noble Consciousness herewith. 
2. The 'superbe gestus" 1 exists only in your imagination." 8 On the 
other hand, Engels, Wolff and my wife, to whom I showed both 
a Presumably Helene Demuth. - b Re - ' 'Karl Vogt und die Allgemeine Zeitung'

your letters, are unanimously agreed that they betray what looks 
uncommonly like disconcertedness at Vogt's libellous piece3  — 
always assuming that très faciunt collegium}' 
I sent you the note,c etc., in order to demonstrate to you ad 
oculosd how you would flare up when confronted with a piece of 
infernal rubbish which has neither appeared in print nor ap­
proaches the level of Vogt's infamies. 
Vogt has charged me with punishable FACTS. In your letters I 
could find no trace of indignation at this worthy citizen to whom, 
for good measure, I am expected to make a public amende 
honorable. Had Vogt known of your relations with me and been in 
possession of Wiss's note, he would have published it as an 
authentic document relating to the history of the 'Brimstone 
Gang'.'™ To suggest that (other than in a letter to you") I had 
alluded anywhere—and in public—to Blind's anti-Vogt  stuff,  is a 
flippant allegation on your part. That V. is a Bonapartist agent has 
become perfectly clear to me from his book. f When Willich 
(Techow merely wrote 5b what Willich had prompted him to in 
1850) slung mud of a similar kind at me in the United States in 
1853, s Weydemeyer, Dr Jacobi and Cluss came out spontaneously, 
even before I myself could have been notified of it, with a public 
statement to the effect that the whole thing was an infamous piece 
of slander. h None of my friends in Germany had uttered a word 
of protest against this extravagant attack; instead they wrote 
admonishing me in patriarchal tones. 
Hence it was wholly pertinent to use the note, etc., for the 
purpose of putting you in my position, or rather of instilling in 
you a correct, if somewhat less dispassionate and doctrinaire, view 
of the same. 
What I sent you was not a copy of Dr Wiss's letter but the 
original (i.e. the copy sent me from America). Dronke knows 
nothing about the note.

recipient of Wiss's letter,3  I referred to you as one of the most 
competent people in our party and an intimate friend of myself 
and Engels. 120 Evidently the recipient, whom I may not name 
without asking him first, showed Wiss the letter, or at any rate told 
him what was in it. Hinc Wiss's lacrimae. b I have no connection 
with Wiss and never have had. Earlier on, he had offered his 
services to the Neue Rheinische Zeitung and submitted an article 
which I threw into the waste paper basket unacknowledged. He has 
published half a dozen idiotic articles against me c in New York (in 
Weitling's Republik der Arbeiter). 
I used the word 'official' allegations'1 simply by way of contrast 
to Wiss's 'confidential' letter. I can see now—I was writing in 
haste—how very comical it was. 
Who the Düsseldorf people e were I cannot say without 
committing a breach of confidence. Suffice it to observe, however, 
that J did not get in contact with them. As for the ingratitude of 
the workers towards you, that's a mere bagatelle compared with 
what I have had to put up with. However it isn't Levy, either as a 
person or collectively. Becker, 1 Bermbach,  Erhard,  Uhlendorff (the 
last name unknown to me) have never written me a single line 
either against you or about you. 121 
/ did not 'ally myself with Becker. The League's Central 
Authority had been transferred to Cologne.122 It was there that the 
final decisions had to be taken. (This 'League', like everything 
connected with it, has long been a thing of the past. With two or 
three exceptions, its documents are in America.) Becker was 
enrolled there. Thus, he established liaison with me. 
If you will now compare the aforementioned FACTS with your 
interpretation of the same, your particular aptitude for 'mistrust' 
will become plain to you. 
As to my mistrust, / know (and you would oblige me by quoting 
other instances) that, during my eighteen years of public activities, 
there have been only two instances when this mental disorder 
might, with some plausibility, have been imputed to me. 
a. In the N. Rh. Zeit. I accepted a denunciation of Bakunin g 
which had originated in Paris from two wholly unrelated sources.

One of these sources was a Polish acquaintance of mine. The other 
was the Paris Lithographierte Korrespondenz, which meant that, even 
were I not to print the denunciation, every newspaper editor 
would have had it. A public accusation was in the interests of the 
cause and in the interests of Bakunin. I had Bakunin's counter-
statement in the Neue Oder-Zeitung reprinted without delay? 
Koscielski, whom he had sent to Cologne as his second to call me 
out, examined the letters from Paris, whereupon he was so 
convinced that it had been my duty as an editor to publish the 
denunciation (I printed it without comment, as though it were an 
article) that he wrote by return of post and told Bakunin he could 
no longer act as his second. K. came to be one of the N. Rh. Z.'s 
best and most useful friends. I printed a public apology to 
Bakunin in the N. Rh. Z., b made it up with him personally in Berlin 
(August 1848) and, later, broke a lance for him in the Tribune 
(1851). 123 
b. In the Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial several 
people, particularly Schapper, O. Dietz and, to a lesser extent, 
Willich, are treated unjustly; however, 
Schapper himself (and Dietz in a letter to Schapper) has admitted 
that in principle I was in the right so far as they were concerned; 
that they got mixed up in acts of such folly that  ' only by a 
miracle could they have expected to elude suspicion; 
that Willich was out of his mind at the time and capable of any 
move against me, indeed was guilty of infamous moves against me 
and my friends. 
Finally: 
The remark: 'As to my mistrust, at least you can't complain about 
that'1 
was a legitimate reply to your remark: (I quote from memory) 
'As regards those who know you, no harm will be done to you by 
Vogt's pamphlet, etc' It was to this anodyne assurance I was 
retorting. 
As to the 'great deal of truth',d I must take another look at your 
letter in London. 
I trust that all points have now been settled.

MARX TO J. M. WEBER 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 3 March 1860 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road 
Sir, 
I have received your letter of 22 February and would first 
tender you my best thanks for your acceptance of my  brief. 
I fully endorse the manner in which you propose to handle the 
case.  Should the count I mention be dismissed on formal grounds, 
its ventilation is, nevertheless, of the utmost importance, at any 
rate so far as the public is concerned. 
By way of a commentary on the enclosures sent herewithd  and 
as a final exposé of the facts at my disposal, I am taking the liberty 
of making a few additional observations, but should, perhaps, first 
point out that, since I have not got a copy of my letter to you of 
13 February,' the numbering corresponds to that of the counts set 
out in my last letter of 24 February/ 
ad IV. ad vocem? Cherval. 
You will have seen from your copy of the Revelations Concerning 
the Communist Trial in Cologne that Mr Karl Schapper was one of 
the two leaders of the section of the 'Communist League'63

inimical to me in 1850 whom I accused of wrongly construing the 
purpose of the then still extant secret society which ought, I felt 
sure,  to disseminate opinions but steer clear of any kind of 
conspiratorial activity, and that I therefore publicly accused Messrs 
Schapper and Co., not only through the medium of counsel at the 
Cologne court,3 but also in the above-named pamphlet, afterwards 
published in Switzerland and America, of having provided Stieber 
and his agents with pretexts for their police machinations, thereby 
bringing about the prosecution of my friends in Cologne. 
While the admission of his errors before a magistrate could not 
but be a blow to Mr Schapper's self-esteem, I knew him to be a 
man of honour (he was proof-reader to the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung in 1848/49), and I therefore wrote to him from here, 
asking him to swear an affidavit to this effect before a London 
magistrate. b He at once proved equal to my expectations. (See 
Enclosure a) Translation: Enclosure f. 1.) 
Like myself,  Mr Schapper has for many years eschewed all 
political agitation. 
Schapper's affidavit also clears up the obscurities that may have 
remained in respect of my relations with the wretched Cherval, 
regarding which, by the by, the National-Zeitung could not have 
been in doubt had they done no more than skim through the reports, 
published in all the leading Prussian papers, of the public proceedings 
at the communist trial in Cologne (October and November 1852). 
It was their bounden duty to do so before making such 
calumnious allegations against me. It was all the more their 
bounden duty in as much as they themselves repeatedly referred to 
the said trial in their leading articles. Schapper's affidavit proves 
that Cherval was never connected with me, but only with my then 
opponents. As regards Cherval, I have this to add: 
From an old letter, which / wrote to Friedrich Engels in 
Manchester (28 October 1852) and which he has kept, I would cite 
the following passage: 
'That Cherval was a police spy is borne out by the following: 
'Firstly, his miraculous escape from prison in Paris immediately 
after sentence; 
'Secondly, his unmolested stay in London, although a common 
criminal; 
'Thirdly, Mr de Rémusat (I have authorised Schneider II to 
name him if necessary) tells me that Cherval offered him his 
services as agent to the Princes of Orleans. Thereupon, he wrote

to Paris and was sent the following documents (of which a copy 
was shown me) from which it emerges that Cherval was first a 
Prussian police spy and is now a Bonapartist one.'3 
The contents of the passage cited above will be corroborated by 
the lawyer, Mr Schneider II from Cologne, should you consider it 
necessary to summon him to Berlin as a witness. The Monsieur de 
Rémusat mentioned in the excerpt from the letter to Engels was, if 
I am not mistaken, a minister under Louis Philippe, or at any rate 
one of the most outstanding deputies of Louis Philippe's day, and 
one of the most eminent writers of the so-called doctrinaire party 
of that time. 
ad II (ad vocem funds for the journal Volk) 
I am sending you, Enclosure b (translation Enclosure f, 2), my own 
affidavit concerning the source of the money placed at the Volks 
disposal by me. 125 
Since I have to stay in Manchester for some time, as my legal adviser 
in the libel action against the London Daily Telegraph lives up here, I 
had to swear the affidavit before a Manchester JUSTICE OF THE  PEACE.  In 
accordance with English law, therefore, it bears no stamp. 
ad I, I have nothing further to add. 
ad III, I would remark: 
As regards my 'connection' with the 'secret police', I could have my 
brother-in-law, the erstwhile Prussian Minister, von Westphalen, 
called as a witness. However, my wife, his sister, wishes to avoid this 
family scandal if it is at all  possible  to do so. That is something I must 
leave entirely to your discretion. 
Enclosure b) (translation: Enclosure f, 3) contains an affidavit by 
G. Müller, chairman of the public German 'Workers' Educational 
Society' in London. 3 It is the only working men's association (save for 
the secret society, the 'Communist League' already mentioned, which 
was disbanded at my behest in November 1852) to which I be­
longed in London since my arrival there (September or August 
1849) until my resignation from the same (mid-September 1850) 
which was publicly announced in various German papers b (including 
the then still extant Londoner Deutsche Zeitungc). It is, in fact, the only 
German working men's association with which I have had anything 
whatever to do during my time of residence in London. Now, at its 
anniversary banquet (6 February 1860, the very day the National-
Zeitung's articles were reproduced in the London newspaper, the

Daily Telegraph) that same association voted a unanimous resolution 
backing me and censuring Vogt, although I had kept aloof from it 
for ten years. 
Its president had this resolution drawn up in legal form in 
London, as you will see from the enclosure. 
adV. I enclose herewith (under Enclosure d) the article the Daily 
Telegraph paraphrased from the National-Zeitung; likewise the reply 
from the Daily Telegraph's (Berlin) correspondent in response to my 
complaint (under Enclosure e), of which I provided a translation in 
my letter of 24 February.3 
I now consider it to be quite unnecessary for the name of my friend 
Ferdinand Freiligrath to be mentioned at all during the course of the 
lawsuit, with the sole exception of the letter to F. Engels dated 
19 November 1852, enclosed in my letter to you of 24 February. b I 
consider that letter essential if the facts are to be established in court.

Supplementary Information 
Needless to say, the only points in Vogt's lampoon which I shall 
touch on in the action against the National-Zeitung are those 
actually incorporated by that newspaper in its leader, whether 
simply as they stood, or in the shape of comments; also, in regard 
to the National-Zeitung, only such points as are punishable by law. 
All else must be kept in reserve against such time as, the 
proceedings being concluded, I can reply to Vogt in writing." 
Hence the only purpose of this supplementary information is 
the following: 
1. To provide some additional observations on those passages in 
the National-Zeitung which, though quite irrelevant to the actual 
case for the prosecution, might possibly be of use in replying to 
defence counsel. 
2. Being myself the son of a lawyer (the late Justizrat Heinrich 
Marx of Trier, for many years bâtonnier of the barreau h there, 
noted for his integrity of character no less than for legal ability), I 
know how important it is for a conscientious lawyer to be quite 
clear about his client's character. In addition, you will perceive that 
certain points given in ad 2 might be used to advantage during the 
proceedings. 
ad 1) The passage from the National-Zeitung, quoted under III 
in my letter of 24 Februaryc  (No. 37 of the National-Zeitung, 
column 2, line 65 from the top et seq.),  goes on: 
'To fill in the picture Vogt publishes among other documents a long letter by 
Techow, a former lieutenant, dated August 26, 1850,' 1 in which', etc. 
Now for a start there is nothing, not a single line, in that 
letter—though anyone who had read only the Nat.-Zeit and not 
Vogt's lampoone  might easily be tempted to think there was— 
about what the Nat. -Zeit, aping Vogt and in concert with him, had 
just before maintained, i.e. 'the compromising of people at home in 
Germany in order to extort money from them by threats of 
denunciation', or 'connections with the secret police in France and 
Germany', and so forth. 
What Techow really says, amounts to no more than this: that he 
went drinking with  myself,  Engels and Schramm (now dead, 
then— 1850—manager of the Revue 1 brought out by Engels and 
* Marx means his Herr Vogt. - b President of the Bar - c See this volume, p.

me in Hamburg), and took in deadly earnest the pranks we played 
upon him while he sought to impress us as an exceedingly serious 
and self-important emissary from a secret society in Switzerland.127 
This applies to the theoretical part of his letter, notably the account 
of his conversation with us (it never took place in that form) which 
evinces the strangest misapprehensions and the most comical 
misrepresentations. No one, I assume, would expect me, a man 
who,  for over fifteen years, has been publishing his views in 
German, French and English, to concern myself seriously with an 
account of my theory written by an ex-lieutenant who has spent no 
more than a few hours of his whole life in my company and at a 
wine tavern at that. Mr Techow's deviousness and mauvaise foi* are 
clearly discernible from the fact that he had earlier written to me 
and Engels from Switzerland, attacking Willich (see Enclosure g: The 
Knight of the Noble Consciousness, pp. 3-4 b), while later, in his letter, 
which was never published, he did not hesitate to disseminate 
Willich's delusions (at that time Willich was actuated by the most 
absurd delusions about the importance of his own person and the 
snares laid for him by imaginary rivals) and his slanderous 
allegations against  myself,  although the tiniest glimmer of common 
sense would have told him that a few days spent in London 
consorting exclusively with those who were then our enemies did 
not entitle him to pronounce a verdict one way or the other. 
So far, I have discussed only what one might describe as the 
theoretical part of Techow's letter (reproduced in Vogtc —whether 
tampered with or not I can't, of course, say — on pp. 142 et seq.). 
I now come to the most incriminating part of the letter, in which 
he speaks of the duel between my friend Conrad Schramm, now 
dead, and Willich. Had the National-Zeitung reprinted the letter, I 
would have enclosed one from Schramm, written long after the 
duel, in which he reproached me with letting myself be influenced 
by Willich because I had advised him [Schramm], albeit vainly, not 
to fight 
Here I need do no more than refer you to Enclosure g, pp. 5-9.d 
(When this appeared in New York in December 1853 they, Willich 
and C. Schramm, were both in America.) 
As regards the pamphlet (Enclosure g), I consider it necessary to 
tell you something about how it came into being.

98 38. Marx to J. M. Weber. 3 March 1860 
In December 1852, just a few weeks after the end of the 
communist trial in Cologne, I sent the ms. of my Revelations 
concerning that trial to Basle—to Schabelitz, the publisher. 
Having delayed publication for months, S. made such blunders 
over dispatching it that the entire consignment destined for 
Germany was confiscated at the Baden border. In the event, I sent 
the ms. to the United States of North America where it appeared 
in Boston in March 1853, first in serial form in the Neu-England-
Zeitung, and then as a pamphlet in its own right. 
The appearance of the Revelations in America coincided with 
that of Mr Willich himself who, together with Kinkel, had gone 
there to drum up a revolutionary loan S] since, according to the view 
published by Kinkel in the German American papers at the time, 
'revolutions are as easily made as railroads', always provided 'the 
necessary cash' is in hand. a It was this kind of balderdash against 
which I took a decided stand. After the appearance of the 
Revelations in America, Willich allowed at least four months to 
elapse before publishing a rejoinder in the New York Criminal-
Zeitung? 
It contained the self-same calumnies and balderdash as 
Techow's letter (indeed, in his letter sent to Switzerland in 1850, 
Techow was merely repeating what Willich had whispered in his 
ear when he was in London, and what Willich was to publish in 
New York in 1853). It was all the more essential that I should 
answer, in that my articles in the New-York Tribune had earned me 
a publicly recognised position in the English-American Press. 
Meanwhile, I had decided that I should deal with the matter 
pertinently if in a jocular vein, as indeed I did in The Knight of the 
Noble Consciousness. Needless to say, Techow could have  replied,  as 
could Willich. However, they deemed it wiser to remain silent and 
not to break that silence in the seven years since that time. 
What insidious inanity, therefore, on the part of the National-
Zeitung (intent only on avenging itself for the criticism I bestowed 
on it in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in 1848/49'), to foist on the 
public as authentic truth tittle-tattle that had long since been publicly 
refuted.

When Vogt's book arrived in London, by the by, I sent it with 
an accompanying letter to Mr Techow in Australia and shall no 
doubt be able to place his reply before the public in four months' 
time. 
Incidentally, the following account of how the letter came to be 
published is typical of Vogt. 
For in a letter from Paris dated 6 February 1860 Schily, a 
lawyer, writes: 
'This letter' (i. e. Techow's) 'passed through different hands before reaching 
mine, where it remained until, following my expulsion from Switzerland (summer 
of 1851), it came into the possession of Vogt via Ranickel (a working man who had 
connections with Willich). For I had been unable to put my papers in order, having 
been picked up quite unexpectedly, without prior notification or an expulsion 
order, in the streets of Geneva, where I had been sent into forced residence, and 
forcibly conveyed via sundry lock-ups to Basle, whence I was sent on my way. My 
papers were put in order for me by friends and in this Ranickel had a hand, which 
is how he came into possession of that document. I later wrote to Ranickel from 
London, asking for the document, but did not get it. As a man specially trusted by 
Willich (he once shared his lodgings at Besançon), he may well have had other 
intentions or instructions.... Ranickel is now said to have a highly successful 
établissement as a book-binder, and to number among his clientèle the gouvernement 
of Geneva (the head of which is Fazy, Vogt's patron). Not content with idolising 
Willich, Ranickel acted as Vogt's informer.' 
Such is the honest manner in which Mr Vogt acquired Techow's 
letter. 
I would ask you not to mention Schily's name, should this point 
be raised, since Vogt, qua Bonapartist agent, is powerful enough 
to have Schily banished from France. 
I need say nothing further on this score save that, no sooner 
had Willich published (in 1853)" the balderdash now reproduced in 
Techow's letter, than there instantly—before, indeed, I could 
possibly have been notified in England—appeared in the self-same 
New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung, a devastating riposte b written by 
Joseph Weydemeyer (former Prussian Lieutenant of artillery, 
subsequently co-editor of the Frankfurt Neue Deutsche Zeitung, 
presently DEPUTY-SURVEYOR in the State of Iowa r) who was in 
Frankfurt am Main and a member of the 'Communist League' 
throughout the time of the rift in London and the Communist 
trial in Cologne. The said statement was also signed by 
11 in his article 'Doctor Karl Marx and seine "Enthüllungen"' - b J. Weydemeyer,

Dr A. Jacobi, now a general practitioner in New York, who was 
himself among the accused at Cologne, but was acquitted. 
As regards the following passage, No. 37 of the National-Zeitung, 
column II, line 31 from top et seq.: 
'They' (i.e. myself and co.) 'continued the work of the Rheinische Zeitung among 
the refugees. In 1849 this paper had counselled against any participation in the movement 
and had also constantly attacked all the members of Parliament, etc' 
allow me to make the following observations: 
It is perfectly correct that, unlike the National-Zeitung, the Neue 
Rh. Zeit, never sought to make a milch cow of the revolution; 
rather that paper was kept on its feet only at considerable financial 
sacrifice and at great personal risk to  myself,  until such time as 
suppressed by the Prussian government. The absurd allegation, 
particularly so when coming from the National-Zeitung, that 'in 
1849 the Neue Rh. Zeit, had counselled against any participation in 
the movement', is best refuted in the columns of the paper  itself. 
As to the manner in which I conducted myself during the 
revolution, I would refer you to Enclosure 1) (Zwei politische 
Prozesse etc.). 
Similarly, it is true that the Neue Rhein. Zeit, always dealt with 
Mr Vogt and the other windbags of the Frankfurt National 
Assembly ironically and in accordance with their deserts. Come to 
that, as he himself admits in his pamphlet, by 1846 Vogt was 
already a naturalised Swiss citizen, i.e. a national of a foreign state, 
and hence should have had absolutely no say in Germany. That 
the Neue Rhein. Zeit, 'attacked all' the members of Parliament is 
incorrect. It was on the most amicable terms with many members 
on the extreme Left. The extent to which even Vogt and Co. 
sought to curry favour with the newspaper almost up to the time 
of its demise is plainly evident if only from the fact that, when 
they founded the March Association?' 1* they sent out a circular 
throughout the length and breadth of Germany in which the 
public was strongly recommended to subscribe to  'good'  and 'the 
best' newspapers, the  'good'  being accorded one asterisk and 'the 
best' two. The Neue Rhein. Zeit, was honoured with 'two 
asterisks'. 3 No sooner had this scrap of paper come into my hands 
than I wrote a short leader in the Neue Rhein. Zeit. (I believe it 
was an issue in March 1849) protesting against this unsolicited 
patronage on the part of people whom I esteemed neither 
for their personal character nor for their political intelligence. b

ad 2) In 1842 (at the age of twenty-four) I was editor-in-chief of 
the old Rheinische Zeitung which, subject first to single, and then to 
double censorship, ended up by being compulsorily closed down by 
the Prussian government (spring, 1843). One of the men with 
whom I was working at the time was Mr Camphausen, Prime 
Minister of Prussia after the March revolution. The old Rhein. Zeit. 
can be said beyond all doubt to have disrupted the power of the 
censorship in Prussia. (I would observe in confidence—not, of 
course, for public consumption—that after the 'Rhein. Zeit.' had been 
closed down, overtures were made to me by the Prussian 
government through the medium of Geheimer Revisionsrat [Privy 
Auditor Councillor] Esser, a friend of my father's. Esser, I should 
explain, was taking the waters with me at Kreuznach, where I 
married my present wife. After this communication, I left Prussia 
for Paris.) 
In Paris I published the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher in 
company with Friedrich Engels, Georg Herwegh, Heinrich Heine, 
and Arnold Ruge. (I later broke with Herwegh and Ruge.) At the 
end of 1844 I was expelled from Paris (by Guizot) at the 
instigation of the Prussian Embassy there and left for Belgium. 129 
The standing I enjoyed amongst French radicals during my stay in 
Paris can best be gauged from Enclosure h), a letter from Flocon of 
I March 1848, recalling me to France in the name of the 
Provisional Government, and annulling Guizot's expulsion order. 
(In confidence: While in Paris in the summer of 1844, after the 
bankruptcy of the publisher (Julius Fröbel) of the Deutsch-Französ. 
Jahrbücher, I received from Dr Claessen, on behalf of Camphausen 
and other Rhein. Zeit, shareholders, a letter—enclosing 1,000 
talers —describing my services in such glowing colours that, for 
this very reason, I shall not enclose it.) 
I lived in Brussels from the beginning of 1845 to the beginning 
of March 1848, when I was again expelled and returned to France 
on the strength of Flocon's letter. In Brussels, besides unpaid 
contributions to sundry radical newspapers in Paris and Brussels, I 
wrote the Critique of Critical Criticism in collaboration with 
Fr. Engels (a book about philosophy, published by Rütten, Frank­
furt am Main, 1845)," Misere de la Philosophie (book on economics, 
published by Vogler in Brussels and by Frank in Paris in 1847),'' 
Discours sur le libre échange (Brussels 1848)/ a work in two volumes 
on latter-day German philosophy and socialism d (not published;

see my preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, 
F. Duncker, Berlin 1859), and numerous pamphlets.130 During the 
whole of my stay in Brussels I gave unpaid lectures on 'political 
economy' at the Brussels German Workers' Educational Society.'51 
These were about to appear in book form when publication was 
interrupted by the February Revolution.132  Typical of my standing 
among the radicals (of very varying complexions) in Brussels is the 
fact that, in the public société internationale, 61 I was committee 
member for the Germans, Lelewel (an old man of eighty, veteran 
of the Polish Revolution of 1830/31 and learned historian) for the 
Poles,  Imbert (later gouverneur of the Tuileries in Paris) for the 
French, and Jottrand, a Brussels lawyer, former member of the 
Constituent Assembly™ and leader of the Belgian radicals, for the 
Belgians, who was also chairman. From the two letters written to 
me by Jottrand, now an old man (Enclosures k, 1, and k, 2), as also 
from Lelewel's letter (Enclosure i), you will see what my 
relationship with these gentlemen was during my stay in Brussels. 
Jottrand's letter (Enclosure k, 2) was written after a dispute I had 
had with him at a public meeting on 22 February 1848, following 
which I had notified him of my resignation from the société 
internationale} 3* He wrote me the second letter, when I founded 
the Neue Rhein. Zeitung in Cologne. 
My second period of residence in Paris lasted from March until 
the end of May 1848.135  (In confidence: Flocon offered to help 
myself and Engels finance the founding of the N. Rh. Z. We 
refused because, as Germans, we did not wish to take subsidies 
from a French government, even if friendly.) 
From May 1848 until the end of May 1849 I was editor of the 
Neue Rh. Zeit, in Cologne. From Enclosure I) you will see that I was 
elected one of the three chairmen of the Rhenish-Westphalian 
democrats. 136 (In confidence: When I arrived in Cologne, I was 
invited by a friend of Camphausen's to go to him in Berlin. I 
disregarded the insinuation.) 
In Paris from June 1849 till August 1849. Expelled under 
Bonaparte's presidency. 
From the end of 1849n7  until now, 1860, in London. Publications: 
Revue der Neuen Rh. Zeitung* in Hamburg, 1850, The Eighteenth 
Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (in New York, 1852), Diplomatie 
Revelations of the 18th Century (London, 1856), Critique of Political 
Economy, 1st instalment, Duncker, Berlin, 1859, etc. Contributor to

remained a member of the German Workers' Society3 (end of 1849 to 
September 1850) I gave unpaid lectures. 
From Enclosure o (it is confidential) you will see how I came to 
make David Urquhart's acquaintance. From that time onwards I 
have contributed to his Free Press. I agree with him in matters of 
foreign policy (opposition to Russia and Bonapartism), but not of 
internal policy, in which I support the Chartist Party (which opposes 
him).  For 6 years now I have contributed gratis to the latter's 
publications (in particular the People's Paper). (See Enclosure TO.) 
My anti-Palmerston articles3 written for the New-York Tribune in 
1853,  have been repeatedly reprinted in pamphlet form in 
England and Scotland, to the tune of 15-20,000 copies. 
You will see from Enclosure n, which was sent me in 1856 at the 
behest of the Sheffield club by the secretary of one of the 
Urquhartite clubs, which are concerned solely with diplomacy, how 
I stand with the Urquhartites, despite our differences over internal 
policy. 
The letter in Enclosure n stems from Ernest Jones, BARRISTER-AT-LAW 
in London, acknowledged leader of the Chartist Party, also 
recognised poet. 
Translations of Enclosures o, n, and m will be found in Enclo­
sure p. 
A typical example of the kind of tittle-tattle about me 
disseminated by certain German quarters in London will be found 
in the letter from my friend Steffen b (formerly Prussian lieutenant 
and teacher at the Divisional School, at present in Boston) quoted 
on p. 14 of Enclosure g, 'The Knight of the Noble Consciousness'. 
Despite ten years of unremitting attacks on  myself,  I have never 
burdened the German public with a single word of my life story. 
Vis-à-vis my lawyer, in a case such as the present one, I considered 
it indispensable. 
As regards the Italian war,46  I should add that my views on the 
subject are absolutely in accord with those expressed by my friend 
Fr. Engels in the well known pamphlet Po and Rhine, published 
by Fr. Duncker in Berlin in 1859. The manuscript of the said 
work was sent to me by Engels before it was dispatched to 
Berlin. 
We are in favour of a free and independent Italy and in 1848 
said as much in the Neue Rh. Zeit., in terms more forthright than any 
other German paper, and the same goes for Hungary and Poland. 
But we do not wish Bonaparte (in collusion with Russia) to make

My dear Sir, 
Having been absent from here for a few days, I was prevented 
answering your letter immediately. 
As to the Printers' Bill,'39 which I had taken the liberty to ask 
you for in a letter addressed to you on the 6th of February42 (if I 
am not mistaken), you have forgotten transmitting it to me. Pray, 
send it to Mrs Marx. 
As to Schaible's declaration {extorted by my proceedings against 
Blind3),  it will be sufficient to remark: 
1-st) Whether Blind be the 'literary' author of the fly-sheet, is a 
question I have not to deal with. He is the author in the legal 
sense of the word. 
Schaible's declaration (which 'circumstances', he says in the 
Telegraph,'' prevented him for three months from making, but 
which I extorted in no time by sending to Louis Blanc a copy of 
the two Affidavits1  at the Bowstreet Police-Court) proves much 
against Vogt. It proves nothing for Blind. It does not exculpate 
him in any respect. He has written (if not drawn up) the 
manuscript; he has printed it in Hollinger's office; he paid 
Hollinger's Printer's Bill; he made two false declarations in the 
Augsburg Gazette d; he and Hollinger entered into conspiracy 
against me in order to induce (and with what success you know) 
a See this volume, p. 49.- b The Daily Telegraph - ' See this volume, pp. 31-32 and

No. 345 (supplement), 11 December 1859.

the compositor Wiehe to give them false evidence. This is not all. 
Blind, as you know from the letter he addressed in September to 
Liebknecht, had the cool impudence of stating that he had nothing 
at all to do with the whole affair. Lastly, all the successive steps 
now taken by him and Schaible were forced upon him by the 
menace suspended over his head for a criminal action for 
'conspiracy'. 
2) Dr Schaible may, for aught I know, have allowed himself to 
be made Blind's scape-goat. He, as I know, belongs so to say to the 
household furniture of Blind's. 
3) The principal political end I aimed at, has been obtained by 
Schaible's declaration. It makes void and annuls the proceedings at 
Augsburg,140 —mere mock proceedings; there being present no 
witnesses, no accuser, no (real) accused, and, in point of fact, no 
tribunal, since Vogt, in his wisdom, had appealed not to that 
description of Bavarian tribunal which, according to the Bavarian 
law, had to decide on the case. In respect to this same Vogt, it will 
suffice to say that at Geneva, his own place of residence, a Swiss 
paper (Die Neue Schweizer Zeitung, The New Swiss Gazette, in its 
number of November 12, 1859) has declared to have indignantly 
repulsed Vogt's attempt at bribing it with French money." That 
same paper, in a leading article, called upon Vogt to take judicial 
proceedings against  itself,  same way as I, in a declaration signed 
with my name, and published in the Augsburg Gazette and the 
Hamburg 'Reform', had called upon him to sue the Volk at 
London. 141 Vogt, although a Genevese Ständerath} 1 and, therefore, 
a public servant, rested mute to these appeals, while enlisting the 
favour of the stupid German Liberals by the Augsburg comedy, or 
rather farce. 
You will be so kind to consider this letter as confidential, since the 
lawyers who carry on my actions for libel at Berlin and London, 
think it fit that, except on the most urgent emergency, I should 
not break my silence until after the judicial proceedings have been 
closed. 
Yours faithfully

My dear Sir, 
You will excuse me for having not before acknowledged the 
receipt of the letter you had the kindness to address me from 
Bruxelles.  I thank you for that letter, although I shall abstain from 
using it in any way. Should I think it opportune laying before the 
public any official documents, relating to my past life, the 
Bruxelles episode—as  far as it refers to my relations with the Belgian 
radicals—would be best characterised by two letters of yours (d.d. 25 
févr. 1848" and 19 mai 1848 b) which I have now found among my 
papers. 
Since you belong to the American school of Republicans (whose 
opinions I do only accept in regard to some  political  questions), it 
may interest you to know that, for about 3 years, I am one of the 
principal writers in the New-York  Tribune,  the first Anglo-American 
paper. I have improved this connexion for giving M. Spilthoorn, on 
his passage through London, letters of recommendation for the 
U. St. Should you, on any occasion, want to publish anything— 
relating to the affairs of your country—in the  Tribune,  you may rely 
on my willingness of obliging you. 
The shameless attacks (on behalf of which I have instituted two 
actions for libel, one at Berlin, one at London) recently made 
against me, proceed all from the Bonapartist camp. Monsieur 
Louis Bonaparte, through the instrumentality of M. Mocquard, his 
secrétaire intime, has publicly thanked the New-York Times for 
having done its best (and this its 'best' was of a very shabby 
description) to counteract my New-York Tribune strictures (since 
1852) of the Lesser Empire. 143

Dear Lassalle, 
Very many thanks for the trouble you have been to with 
Duncker in connection with my pamphlet.b I would have agreed to 
the arrangement of my being named had not another publisherc 
accepted it in the meantime (when this reaches you, the thing will 
probably be out) and were I not determined that the 'author of Po 
and Rhine' should first carve out a place for himself in military 
literature before making his official entry (i.e. on the title page) as 
a civilian before the lieutenants. When you say that you would be 
sure to convince us and hence believe it would be in our own 
interests not to commit ourselves by name to the views we have held 
so far in regard to the Italian business, your argument is, no doubt, 
of crucial value subjectively speaking; similarly we can assure you that 
we are just as sure of our ability to convince you, the more so 
since our views are based on a careful study of diplomatic material 
which, at least on certain points, is available in pretty complete 
form to the public in London, as it surely is not to the public in 
Berlin (where, indeed, it does not for the most part exist at 
all).

42. Engels to Ferdinand Lassalle. 15 March 1860 109 
Apropos. A few days ago we got a letter from Nothjung. After 
his release, the poor devil was declared to have forfeited his right 
of domicile in Mülheim 'by reason of his many-year-long ab­
sence' (H!), 144 and has been forbidden to show his face within five 
miles of Cologne. He has become a photographer in Breslau 3 where, 
after a great deal of trouble, he has obtained a resident's permit. 
Now he has got to pay an entry fee, a household fee, and 
umpteen others such as are only to be found in a Prussian 
dictionary. This, as you can imagine, the poor chap is in no 
position to do after his long spell in prison which, to make matters 
worse, has rendered him homeless (in what sort of country can 
such things happen!) and so odious are the laws still obtaining 
there that he cannot exist unless he gets all this business settled. 
Mightn't it be possible to do something for him over there? Such a 
thing would have been unheard of in the Rhine Province before 
1848,  and even the bourgeois who helped to impose such shocking 
laws on us ought to help poor devils of this kind. Homeless 
because of a many-year-long absence in a Prussian fortress—just 
try telling that to an Englishman! His address is P. Nothjung, 
Photographer, Zwingergasse No. 7, in the Baths. With the 
connections you have in Breslau, it should be easy for you to do 
something for him. Our ex-tailor, by the way, seems to have 
acquired quite a tidy education at his fortress-university, and 
writes quite civilised letters. 
Just now I'm writing trivia about the reorganisation of the army in 
Prussia and have offered these to Duncker.

Sir, 
I am enclosing herewith the last two documents needed to 
complete what has already been sent. The first is a letter from the 
editor-in-chief of the New-York Tribune to me.1 I have included a 
German translation. 
The second document is highly important in that it proves that 
the wretched Cherval, alias Nugent, alias Cramer, far from being 
in touch with me when he was in Geneva, was hounded out of that 
city as a result of my book about the Communist trial in Cologne.b 
The letter is from Johann Philipp Becker in Paris (Becker fled 
after the affair of  1830/31,  in 1848/49 he first commanded the 
volunteers in Baden, then he was colonel of the revolutionary 
army in Baden and the Palatinate; he is now a business man in 
Paris and, so to speak, the doyen of the German émigrés) and is 
directed to Rheinländer, a merchant in London, with whom he 
has business connections. Mr Rheinländer, who is an acquaintance 
of mine, was good enough to let me have the letter. 1 
Apart from this letter, I have also sent you:

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 8 April 1860 
Dear Moor, 
During the last few days of my stay in Barmen ,46 the contract 
relating to the Manchester business has been subjected to 
thorough legal scrutiny. This convinced me that everything over 
here was hanging in the balance and that I must get back without 
a moment's delay. I left on Friday morning at 6 o'clock and was 
back here by 12 noon yesterday, i.e. in 30 hours. *The thing was, 
we wanted to secure Charley.*'1 This was accomplished yesterday 
evening, in so far as it was necessary, and now I shall have to wait 
and see what Gottfriedb does. However, my base of operations is 
now secure. 
Under the circumstances, I shan't be able to come to London 
until everything here has been settled. Until then I shall be up to 
my eyes in business matters and legal quibbles, and there's nothing 
I can do about it. In the meantime I have learned from Gumpert 
and Siebel what they know. I've neither seen nor heard anything 
of my pamphlet. c You might return me the copy you have, also 
the letter (presumably from Fischel?) G. sent you,'1 so that I know 
what is going on. Open the letter if you haven't already done so; 
this will save writing to and fro. 
G. told me that there had been some further unpleasantness at 
my lodgings; I'm moving out straight away. 
I neither saw nor heard anything of the Prussian police. No one 
demanded my passport or anything of that kind. The few 
policemen I ran into in Barmen gave me a MILITARY  SALUTE,  that was 
all. 
Industry on the Rhine has developed enormously and the 
constitutional system has bitten deep into the citizenry. Things 
have changed vastly since 1848, though sufficient of the old leaven 
still remains. 
Still no reply from Webere ? If it doesn't arrive soon, there'll be 
nothing else for it but to get Ephraim Artful f to take him to task.

Dear Engels, 
Great disappointment today when, instead of  yourself,  your 
letter arrived. However, we saw that it only made 'good sense'. 
Siebel has carried out his mission well and with great 
discretion. 147 
I still haven't been able to find the key.3 However, the 'upper' 
key also fits the lower key-hole. It locks both compartments. 
I shall send you Weydemeyer's letter shortly. 
Before leaving Manchester I confided to Gumpert, etc., such 
fables as I thought necessary to justify my non-trip to Holland. 
Freiligrath has written me a friendly letter. Up till now I have 
neither answered him, nor seen him. 
The only letter I have had from Gumpert that was addressed to 
you was intended for me—from Liebknecht, who informs me that 
the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung has given him notice. 148

My dear friend Becker, 
First, my most sincere thanks for your letter, for the verbal 
information you gave to Siebel and for sending the correspondence. 
Apart from anything else, I ought to account Sieur c Vogt's attack a 
blessing, if only because it has brought me into closer contact with 
the doyen of our revolution and our emigration. I do not, by the 
by, share the Philistines' astonishment at the consistency of your 
behaviour. Hitherto I have always found that, once they set out on 
a revolutionary course, all men of really reliable character—I 
would mention only old Levasseur, Cobbet, Robert Owen, Lelewel 
and General Mellinet—constantly draw fresh strength from their-

setbacks and become ever more resolute, the longer they swim in 
the stream of history. 
The next reason for my writing—other than the desire to 
convey my thanks to you personally—is that I have been 
commissioned by my old friend J. Weydemeyer to enlist corres­
pondents in Europe for the Stimme des Volks. This paper, I should 
say, has been founded in Chicago by the American Workers' 
League, 149 whose headquarters have moved from New York to 
Chicago. It is a daily paper and may acquire even greater 
importance since Chicago is increasingly becoming the metropolis 
of the North-West. I enclose the heading of the prospectus. 
Terms are as follows: You would have to contribute once a week. 
Fee 2 dollars per article. This would come to ABOUT £5 or 125 fr. a 
quarter. The fee is a small one, nor could it be otherwise in the 
case of a workers' paper. On the other hand, my friend 
Weydemeyer's character is a guarantee of prompt payment, which 
cannot exactly be said of German-American papers elsewhere. If 
you agree to this request, you could start next week, but notify me 
beforehand. 
The parcel containing the invaluable correspondence came by 
post, the day before S. arrived in London. I shall get them bound 
and always keep them at your disposal. Among them is a 
document of a column mutinying against Willich, 3 which is highly 
characteristic of this Don Quixote. 
I should be very glad—and it would be of great importance to 
my pamphletb —if you, with your intimate knowledge of Fazy, 
could send me a thumb-nail sketch of his goings-on since the coup 
d'état, also a vignette of the man's character. I regard Vogt simply 
as the servant of Fazy, whom I once saw in Paris (1843) and whom 
I at once sized up correctly by his being a former contributor to 
the National (on which the best of them were bad). 
Lommel's little work1 is entertaining and has some useful 
revelations about 1847/48. But I can't agree with his extremely 
parochial ideas about the origins of the year of revolution. 
However it is, perhaps, the very narrowness of his outlook that 
enables him to portray vividly and with true insight the ground 
with which he is personally familiar. 
Your two little poems about Leibniz and 'What of it?' pleased 
me enormously and it would be a good idea if you were to enclose

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 150 
IN BERLIN 
London, 9 April I860 
(The old address) 
Dear Lassalle, 
Since your last letter, all manner of things have happened. 
Engels' father has died and Engels has spent a fortnight in Prussia 
by permission of the Prussian Government. I  myself,  however, 
have been overwhelmed with business, and even now can only 
write quite briefly. 
1. My lawyer3 in Berlin has asked me to undertake not to mention 
his name. If, however, despite the mass of material I have sent him 
and despite various reminders, these six weeks of silence are 
prolonged, you will have to prod him, for the case becomes 
statute-barred on 22 April. 
2. Vogt visited Plon-Plon in Paris. He was seen by acquaintances 
of mine, who spoke to him. Nevertheless, he had the effrontery to 
state,  or cause it to be stated, in the German papers that he had not 
been to Paris.

5. My old friend /. Weydemeyer has given up his post as 
DEPUTY-SURVEYOR in the state of Wisconsin at the request of the 
American 'Workers' League' (a public society with branches 
throughout the United States) 149 which has moved its headquar­
ters from New York to Chicago (Illinois). W. will assume the 
editorship there of a daily paper founded with the help of 
workers' shares." Chicago is increasingly becoming the centre in 
the American North-West where German influence predominates. 
W. has asked me to enlist correspondents for the paper and this I 
have done over here, in Paris and in Switzerland.b I invite you to 
undertake the German articles (if possible at least two a week). 
There is no question of payment. But as party work it is very 
important. W. is one of our best people. If, as I hope, you agree to 
this, you should start directly and send your articles to: 
'J. Weydemeyer,  CARE  OF Chicago Arbeiterverein, BOX 1345, 
Chicago (Illinois), United States.' 
6. While leafing through the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (neces­
sary on Vogt's account) I was glad to discover a short leader in 
which we broke a lance with the Vossische c for Miss Ludmilla 
Assing. 
7. Would it be possible for you to send me a brief sketch of 
what the worthy Zabel of the National-Zeitung has been up to, 
since reaction set in? The sketch could appear in my pamphlet d 
as a letter signed by you. You would, moreover, find yourself in 
the company of highly honourable refugees who are writing about 
other people for this work. Some anonymously, others under 
their own names. Several do not belong to our faction of the 
party.

MARX TO GEORG LOMMEL 
IN GENEVA 
[Draft] [London,] 9 April 1860 
To G. Lommel. (Geneva) 
Citizen, 
I have been told by Siebel, whom I saw a day or two since at 
Freiligrath's while on his way back from Switzerland, that a letter 
sent by me from Manchester on 26 February to the editors of the 
Neue Schweizer Zeitung, 4'2 and intended for you, has fallen into 
Brass's hands. For I had been informed that you were the editor 
of the Neue Schweizer Zeitung, a paper I have never seen. It was in 
this belief that I wrote to you, since your name was known to me 
through its having featured with such great credit in the annals of 
the revolution. I would not have written to Mr Brass. 
What I wanted of you was to learn something about Vogt's 
activities. Material concerning the activities of V. and other 
Bonapartist agents has been pouring in from people belonging to 
the emigrations of various countries and to the various schools of 
thought within the revolutionary party. But I wish to set to work 
with discrimination and a strict regard for the truth. A contribu­
tion from you, with your intimate knowledge of how things stand 
in Switzerland, would therefore be of the utmost value to me. 
With regard to your book Hinter den Coulissen, a copy of which 
was given me by Siebel, I found this of great interest and believe it 
is important that the second part should appear. In the case of the 
latter, I might be able to get hold of a financially reliable bookseller 
for you over here. With regard to part I, I think I could dispose of 
300 copies at 1 franc apiece, partly by direct sales at the various 
societies in London, partly through booksellers. But first the 
copies would have to be here. If this appeals to you, send the copies 
to the booksellers 'Petsch, etc., London'. 
Finally, I have one more proposal to make you. My friend 
J. Weydemeyer (previously co-editor of the Neue Deutsche Zeitung 
in Frankfurt) has given up his post as DEPUTY-SURVEYOR in the state 
of Wisconsin at the request of the Workers' League in the United 
States (which has moved its headquarters from New York to 
Chicago), 149 in order to take over the editorship in Chicago of Die 
Stimme des Volks, a daily paper founded by the Working Men's and 

=====第155页=====
49. Marx to Georg Lommel. 9 April 1860 119 
Gymnastic Club.152  I have been asked by him to enlist correspon­
dents in Europe, and this I have done over here, in Paris and in 
Berlin. I am taking the liberty of inviting you to act as 
correspondent for Switzerland, initially on the basis of one 
contribution per week. Fee 2 dollars (10 frs.) per article— 
payments, as might be expected from a paper of this kind and 
particularly at the outset, will be modest for the time being, but 
will improve as the paper grows. Hitherto there has been only one 
daily in the state of Illinois, the Staatszeitung? Day by day, 
however, Chicago is increasingly becoming the centre of the entire 
North-West of America, where there is a very large German 
population. I can guarantee prompt payment. If you agree to this 
proposal, will you start straight away this week and be good enough 
to advise me. The address is: 
J. Weydemeyer,  CARE  OF Chicago Arbeiterverein, BOX 1345, 
Chicago (Illinois), United States. 
To come back to Vogt, you will have seen a statement of mine 
(beginning of February) b in various German newspapers to the 
effect that I shall reply to his lampoonr after settlement of the 
libel action I have brought against the Berlin National-Zeitung for 
printing excerpts from Vogt's concoction.d 
On pp. 180-181 (cf. the passage) Vogt speaks of a 'conspiracy' 
he foiled at the Lausanne working men's festival. Can you give me 
any information about this piece of boasting? The passage runs as 
follows: 153 What is the truth of the matter? 
Finally, I would take the liberty of pointing out that your 
account of Vogt's activities, which you could send me in the form 
of a letter, thereby finding yourself in the highly honourable 
company of other refugees (though it cannot appear until later by 
reason of the lawsuit in Berlin"), would figure in my pamphlet' as 
a section in its own right, contributed by you, and I would, of 
course, pass on to you the fee per sheet paid me by the publisher 
in respect of the section you had contributed. I say this because I 
know full well what it is to be a refugee, having myself lived under 
those conditions almost uninterruptedly for seventeen years, and it 
would be most unjust if one of us were to accept payment from a 
publisher at the expense of another. Owing to the lawsuit in

Berlin and also because Vogt's main attack, etc., is directed against 
me, my pamphlet will be in great demand and will find a good 
publisher in Germany. One is inclined to ask whether a 
concentration of attacking forces would not be desirable in the 
interests of the cause. On that point you will, of course, be entirely 
your own judge and under no circumstances should you 
misconstrue my plain speaking.

ENGELS TO EMIL ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
Manchester, 11 April 1860 
Dear Emil, 
What do you think G. Ermen's latest proposals are? 
1. He wants to buy mother out by instalments and assume sole 
control of the business. 
2. Under the terms envisaged in the contract / am to stay on 
with him as clerk for another four years! 
At so cheap a price does the fellow think to buy us out of our 
inheritance in the firm of Ermen & Engels and obtain my grateful 
assent to my own degradation vis-à-vis  himself. 
The negotiations were quite amicable. The proposals affecting 
myself I turned down flat, whereupon he held out the prospect 
that I might become a partner in four years, whereupon I 
demanded guarantees before I could consider the matter and told 
him that we were all of the opinion that, if there was to be a

parting of the ways, it would mean division in kind and 
competition. This surprised him greatly, and the matter progressed 
no further. He had imagined that we in Barmen were urgently in 
need of money (as to which I enlightened him) and wanted to exploit 
the opportunity. In short, he was very disappointed by the 
conversation and will doubtless make some other approach. More 
when I see you. 
After this affair, we can be more certain of Charles'* than ever; 
he actually believes that we two will be able to make Gottfried b do 
anything, perhaps even retire into private life.

Dear Engels, 
BEST  THANKS for the hundred pound note. It came as a glorious 
surprise THIS MORNING. The whole family was filled with glee. 
You may or may not have seen that the Kölnische Zeitung

good offices of my bankrupt friend Speck I am now hot on the 
trail of the whole Brimstone Gang here in London.

amused himself by presenting Mr Reuter (the Jew from Trieste of

Hörfei and Schlesinger, was a partner in a Bonapartist litho­

Esterhazy, a  MAN  ABOUT  TOWN  and the cousin of Esterh., the Austrian 
ambassador); they fell out, etc. Mr Bernhard  Wolff,  chief proprietor 
of the Berlin 'National-Zeitung' and owner of the Berlin telegraphic 
bureau, is hand-in-purse (partners) with S. Engländer, who is at 
present editing European world history in Reuter's name. N. B.

[London,] 16 April 1860 
Dear Engels, 
Have had some most valuable material from Lommel today." 
However, he volunteered to submit to a further CROSS-EXAMINATION, 
and one such has already gone off to him today.42  It was also 
much needed. Moreover, in the letter in which I buttered him up, 
I suggested he should send 300 copies of his Hinter den Coulissen 
to Petsch (the booksellers) here. I would promote the sales (in 
working men's clubs, etc.). Now he wants an advance of 150 
francs. I think that you in Manchester should CI.UB together 
forthwith and raise a few pounds, while I would find the rest down 
here.  The man is invaluable to us. He has also written about this to 
Siebel. Hence I shall also drop the latter a couple of lines today. 
Siebel should do nothing without first consulting me. 
I enclose Weydemeyer's letter. 
Not a word yet from that confounded lawyer,1' to whom I sent a 
reminder last Friday.1 However, he's got the retaining fee, and I 
his acceptance of the  brief.  So, I cannot imagine that he will lay 
himself open to a lawsuit against  himself.

major work,  he has in his  mind  a clear outline  of three other 
major works, including  the  'political economy',  and is, in  addition, 
studying  6-7  unnamed sciences 'with productive intent'.  The

whereby  the  former imperial regents have  the  right  to recall  the 
German parliament  on any  particular occasion? 
Do you or  Lupus know anything about  a request  for annexation

Dear General, 
In furtherance of a work I intend to publish on Bonapartist 
machinations," I am taking the liberty of addressing myself to you 
as one of the most vigorous champions of European liberty. 
During the recent war in Italy  4(i you issued a statement in which 
you showed that you had seen through the humbug and had 
therefore made a timely exit from the stage—proof, if proof were 
needed, of your superiority to that clown, Kossuth, and his 
sycophants. Having unfortunately lost that statement, I had 
recourse to Szemere in Paris.b He referred me to you. Hence, if 
yoq would be so kind as to let me have a copy of the said 
statement, together with your comments on the deception 
practised on the Hungarians in Italy, you would be doing a service 
to the good cause. 
As early as last summer (1859), in articles of mine which 
appeared in the New-York Tribune' and the London 'Free Press',d I 
mentioned your name as that of the only military representative of 
the Hungarian emigration not to have succumbed to the bribes 
and wiles of the diplomats of France and Russia, or allowed 
himself to be impressed by Kossuth's phantasmagoria, and, in the 
new book I propose to write, I should be glad to allot you the 
place of honour that befits you. 
I am taking the liberty of reminding you that, as early as 
1848-49, when Editor-in-Chief of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, I 
was the most determined advocate of revolutionary Hungary in 
Germany. Now, as then, I consider Hungary's independence and 
sovereignty to be the conditio sine qua of Germany's  release  from slavery. 
But with no less determination do I reject the endeavour to

Dear Engels, 
I trust that your indisposition isn't serious. Also that you are 
taking care of yourself and not over-working. 
I have sent Lommel the 150 francs today." (What you don't 
manage to scrape together in Manchester will be collected here.) 
For the following reasons: 
1. If he is to retrieve the booksb from the bookbinders', he has. 
got to pay 50 frs. That leaves him 100 frs. To haggle over that 
would be exceedingly impolitic and would not command any respect 
for our party. 
2. The main thing is that the so-called advance be sent to the 
chap quickly and unconditionally. In that way, he'll be beholden to 
us. The other half he shall have  BY AND  BY and thus will remain 
ENGAGED tO US. 
3. As soon as he has the money, he will leave for Savoy whence 
he will send back reports. 
4. From Petsch's note enclosed herewith (I gave him the copy 
Siebel brought back with him) you will see that he believes that he 
can make a profit on what is, in fact, an interesting pamphlet. 
5. L. is a decent chap. Otherwise he'd sell  himself.  From the 
papers Becker has sent me, I see that Lommel was a leading light

Sir, 
I have no hesitation in expressing my regret that you should 
have taken offence at my taking home the book of calculations 
during dinner-time. As books have been taken home, before, by 
others connected with the office, I did not expect it would have 
caused you any annoyance. As to any intentions on my part of 
taking any undue advantage, you are aware that the whole of the 
calculations contained in the said book are so much out of date 
that not one of the elements given therein agrees with the present 
real cost. I could not, therefore, have any such intention, and [I] 
hope the feeling now expressed by you is not in any way 
influenced by the prospect of the arrangements for winding up, or 
otherwise settling, the affairs of the firm, it being the interest of 
all parties that such matters should be conducted in a friendly and 
accommodating spirit.

Sir, 
Eleven days ago I sent you a letter," in which I notified you that 
I had still not received either an acknowledgment of, or a reply to, 
the numerous letters (enclosing documents, power of attorney, 
etc.) despatched from here and Manchester over the past two 
months, although your letter of 22 February had led me to expect 
an early communication and, according to that same letter, the 
action will become statute-barred on 22 April (i.e. tomorrow). I 
therefore requested an explanation. 
Having received no reply to that letter either, I am forced to 
conclude 
Either that my letters failed to arrive, although every one, save 
the last, was registered; 
Or that at least one of your letters has been intercepted. 
Therefore, should this letter suffer the same fate as its 
predecessors, I shall lodge a complaint both with the General Post 
Office over here and with the Prussian Embassy; I shall also, if 
need be, make a public protest in the columns of the London 
'Times'.

MARX TO ENGELS

[London,] 24 April 1860 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Herewith a letter from Weber. From that letter I learn for the 
first time (what the jackass might have been kind enough to tell 
me earlier on) that he did not originally file a civil but a criminal 
action for injuria against Zabel, which means that, under Prussian 
law, the application has to be countersigned by the Royal 
Procurator's Office. Since this has been refused, he has appealed. 
It is, of course, 'an issue of public importance' 156 to the Prussian 
government that we should be traduced to the utmost. 
From his letter you will see that he also instituted the civil action 
on the 18th. 
Will you let Dr Heckscher know about this business and give 
him some notes (a few lines) on the subject for the Hamburg 
Reform}''  He has himself repeatedly offered to do me a service of 
this kind, and the matter has got to be brought out into the open 
(if only to instil a little caution into the Prussian government). I 
am also writing to Siebel to this effect. Indeed, the public must not 
be allowed to suppose that the matter has lapsed. 
The stuff from Lommel (I have got six or seven more 
documents from him)b  contains ample CIRCUMSTANTIAL EDIVENCE of 
Vogt's bribery. Vogt no longer feels safe in Geneva and has 
therefore applied for Schwyz citizenship. I hope, by the by, that 
one of these days you will write me a proper letter telling me just 
how your affairs are going. It's not very friendly of you to treat me 
with the reserve that might be appropriate in the case of others. 
How goes it with your health? I've been most anxious about it. 
Your

9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park,

Dear Lassalle, 
Many thanks for Humboldt a and Fichte.'59  I hadn't yet read the 
latter, and it was CLEVER of you to throw it into the fray. When your 
letter arrived, I got Engels to send me both your letter and the 
one from Counsellor Weber in Berlin. From this last I see that the 
matter of not mentioning his name applied solely to my public 
announcements in the newspapers' 3; hence I was, in this instance, 
labouring under a misapprehension. 
Today I have heard from Weber. From his letter it would 
appear that he began by filing a criminal action>He then received 
the following communication dated 18th inst. 
'The original documents are returned to Dr Carl Marx, c/o Counsellor Weber, 
together with the notification that no issue of public importance is raised by this 
matter which could make it desirable for me to take any action (Art. XVI of the 
Prolegomena to the Penal Code of April 14, 1851). Berlin, April 18, etc. Lippe.' 
Weber has appealed to the Chief Public Prosecutor1 against this 
ruling. At the same time, in order to prevent its becoming 
statute-barred and to keep open another course of action, he has 
filed the action for injuria with the civil judge. 
With my pamphletd in view, I am, of course, having investiga­
tions made in Paris and Switzerland, and have even sent an 
emissaryc  to Geneva. I now have proof that Vogt is a French 
agent. At the moment, he no longer feels safe in Geneva and is 
therefore sounding out the possibility of becoming a citizen of 
another canton.

Dear Frederick, 
Herewith: 
1. Letter from Fischel. ltii Gumpert's belief that he sent me a letter 
written to you from Berlin is a DELUSION. The letter to you which he 
sent contained Liebknecht's letter to me.1 
2. Letter from Szemere. I haven't written to him for a long time 
because I disliked intensely the way he flattered Badinguet163 and 
Pam in his pamphlet.b However, I shall now give him a piece of 
my mind. 
3. Letter from Emmermann and Beust to Schily. 164 What do you 
think of these worthies? Beust, buckling on his sword and accusing 
me of prevarication just because he got scared and decamped 
from Cologne! You needn't return the letters to me, but had 
better file them. 
As regards Fischel's suggestion, I must first know more about 
the kind of newspaper he envisages, the line it will take, etc. 
I'm very glad that it was Schimmelpfennig who was Techow's 
addressee 5h for that will enable me to present the one in terms of 
the other. It's also a good thing that Willich prevented a reply to 
Schapper. I shall treat him with mild irony.

Dear Moor, 
Heckscher sent the story to the Reform" straight away, but with 
what success I don't yet know; as usual, having made a great song 
and dance about his influence, he now says he can't promise it will 
appear, etc. 
Meanwhile Siebel has got it into the Mittelrheinische Zeitung. 
Any news from Berlin? 
Mr Szemere has put me to great expense over the Tokay. The 
wine's so sweet that no one can drink it, so I've sent back the 
whole lot, apart from a bottle or two, and shall, of course, have to 
bear all the expenses, customs duty, etc., etc. He writes most 
civilly, offering me other wines, but charges three times as much 
as Charles'sb  wine merchant in Pest. The fellow is trying to make 
huge profits out of his 'entreprise toute patriotique'. Nous verrons! 1 
Siebel is ill with some 'genius's ailment' on which, as usual, he 
prides  himself.  I shall go and see him this evening. 
I haven't heard a word about my pamphletd  or seen anything in 
the papers. It's the conspiration du silence all over again. 
Apropos. Reiff has come up here, or so he says, on the advice of 
Liebknecht, Lochner, etc.! He wants me to help him with money; is a 
street musician. I've told him that in the circumstances I would first 
have to write to you, which didn't seem to please him.— Said you

My brother Emil is here and is negotiating with Ermen. I shall 
probably be remaining with Gottfriedf as clerk with a percentage

Dear Frederick, 
Reiff is a scoundrel. No one sent him up to Manchester. He 
disappeared from here after he had been exposed. He was thrown 
out of the League 63 back in 1850. During the preliminary 
investigation at the Cologne trial2 he actually turned traitor. I've 
just found a letter of Bermbach's which refers to this.3 So, have 
nothing to do with him. 
As to your pamphlet,1 ' you'll have found something in Fischel's 
letter. By the by, in your place I shouldn't hesitate to exploit 
friend Siebel's minor literary connections (as soon as he's up and 
about again, that is) for the purpose of combating the conspiration 
du silence. Had you actually put your name to the pamphlet, the 
public would have seized upon it, if only out of curiosity. Behrend, 
by the by, seems to be even worse than Duncker. 
Szemere is a man who likes to ask others to do him a service, 
but who keeps his own pocket-flaps buttoned. You have now done 
enough for him and, if I were you, I would leave his wine to its 
mission toute patriotique?

From your letter  it would appear that  you are  once again going

As for the proposed newspaper, I would not be averse to 
becoming involved in it.162 Only I would first have to know 
something more about its establishment, political outlook, etc. As 
regards foreign policy (and this, as from England, would no doubt 
be the main thing), I believe that we are in substantial agreement. 
On the other hand, there might well be considerable differences 
of opinion in regard to internal policy. The main thing, of course, 
is to know what attitude the newspaper intends to adopt in 
Prussia. If it eschews an emphatically one-sided party viewpoint, I 
should say that, at the present time, when Germany is in danger, 
people of varying political views could work together against 
foreign foes, without making any mutual concessions. 
Yours very truly, 
K. Marx

Dear Moor, 
My brotherb left this evening because my mother is seriously ill 
and sent for him by telegram. 
Matters have been pretty well settled with Ermen. My family is 
leaving capital amounting to £10,000 in the business, which it will 
have to make over to me when I become a partner. My material 
position will improve straight away, or at least the percentage of 
my share. I shall tell you all about this when I come down at 
Whitsun. Providing, that is, that everything's settled by then, and 
a Marx's note to the copy of the letter in his notebook. - '' Emil Engels

nothing has happened to my mother, so that I am, in fact, able to 
come. But I'm rather afraid she may have caught the infection 
from my father. I feel as though typhoid fever has now got a grip 
on our family. 
About the other points, tomorrow. 
Siebel wants to know whether, amongst the papers he brought 
back, you have found the pamphlet, Die Sphinx auf dem 
französischen Kaiserthron*; Schily has noticed that it's missing and is 
afraid he may have lost it. 
Saw Lupus yesterday. The bone's still troubling him, and 
rheumatism into the bargain. It almost looks as though Gumpert's 
intervention is bringing the matter to a head, which is just as well, 
since it will be over all the sooner, and then L. will be back on his

140 68. Marx to Carl Siebel. 15 May 1860 
Apropos. 
If you were to send the Mittelrheinische Zeitung a note about the 
progress of my case, dated 'Berlin', you might take the opportuni­
ty of slipping in a word or two about the Eichhoff-Stieber case, 44 
which was decided on 10 May in the Court of the First Instance in 
Berlin. For Eichhoff has been given an eighteen-month sentence 
for 'libelling' Stieber. The libel suit rested mainly on the 
denunciation of Stieber (in the London Hermann) for perjury, 
theft, etc., perpetrated by him in the course of the Communist 
trial in Cologne (1852). 2 Below I cite various instances that are 
characteristic of the proceedings in the Prussian law court. 
1. Eichhoff 's denunciation rested (except for my pamphlet, 3 
which he could not, of course, mention) on the reports printed by 
the 'Kölnische Zeitung' during the proceedings in Cologne, 1' the 
authenticity of which has never been challenged either by Stieber 
or by anyone else. The court declared these reports to be 
inadmissible evidence. Whenever it was in the interests of Stieber, 
the court allowed as authentic the reports in the Vossische Zeitung c 
(probably deriving from Stieber himself), because they had been 
declared 'authentic' by Signor Stieber. Whenever it went against 
the interests of Stieber's denunciator, the selfsame court declared 
the meagre record kept by the clerk of the court to be the only 
authentic source. 
2. Goldheim, a police official, and  Greif,  a police lieutenant, 
Stieber's chief fellow-culprits and his subordinate tools in the 
Communist trial of 1852, were wholly exempted from CROSS-
EXAMINATION because the court did not wish to expose these 
gentlemen to the alternative (as the presiding judge' 1 frankly 
stated) 'of either committing perjury or testifying against them­
selves'. On the other hand, their statements were allowed as 
evidence for Stieber's defence. 
3. In 1851, Stieber and Greif had got the Prussian police spy 
Reuter to break into Oswald Dietz's house and steal papers, which 
(although they were in fact quite irrelevant to the charge 1<>8) were 
produced in evidence by Stieber during the Cologne trial. This 
a Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne - b  Reports on the 
Communist trial in Cologne were published in the Kölnische Zeitung from 5 
October to 13 November 1852, under the title 'Assisen-Procedur gegen D. Herrn. 
Becker und Genossen. Anklage wegen hochverrätherischen Complottes'. -
' Reports on the Cologne Communist trial were published in the Königlich 
privilegirte Berlinische Zeitung von Staats- und gelehrten Sachen (Vossische Zeitung) from 
6 October to 16 November 1852, under the title 'Die Verhandlungen des grossen 
Kommunistenprozess vor dem Assisenhofe zu Köln. - d Göbel

69. Marx to Engels. 28 May 1860 141 
theft was one of the counts upon which Eichhoff's denunciation of 
Stieber rested. And now just listen to this! Drenkmann, the Royal 
Procurator, enunciated the following brand-new theory of theft: 
'The question as to whether or not the papers were acquired by theft may,' he 
said, 'be left in abeyance; in forming an opinion of the accused, it is of no account. 
Had they in fact been acquired by theft, the police official who had thus obtained 
them could not be accused of theft in the legal sense, but at most of immoral 
conduct. A theft in the legal sense demands a dolus malus? This, however, cannot 
be assumed of police officials who might have instigated such a theft, since they 
would have been acting, not for their private advantage, but in the interests of the 
State.' 
Thus,  if a Prussian police official breaks into a house in London 
and 'steals' from it, he is 'at most' committing an immoral action, 
but not a crime in law. This is a suspension of  COMMON  LAW imposed 
upon the English by the Prussian State. 
4. Hirsch, in prison in Hamburg, had testified on oath that the 
minute-book 169 had been fabricated by himself and Fleury under 
Greifs supervision. Why wasn't Hirsch taken to Berlin to be 
cross-examined as a witness there during the trial?

Dear Moor, 
I return Ephraim Artful a herewith. His proposal re yourself is 
truly crazy.b  After all, there's nothing you could say, either, about 
what happened in Cologne. However, Ephraim might be of some 
use in the matter. At least he has more PLUCK than the old women 
actually involved at Cologne, who always prefer to endure 
everything patiently. But it might also be worthwhile trying to see 
if there's anything to be done from Cologne. 
Ad vocem'1  Fischel, perhaps we'd better tell the fool the more or 
less unvarnished truth and give him a bit of a lesson about the 
extent to which the word 'reactionary' has come to be [just] an 
empty phrase in his mouth. You might also take the opportunity 
of getting him to explain just why He, Ephraim the Profound, 
agrees in effect with our own and Fischel's 'anti-Palmerstonianism'. 
An enigma—at least so far. A private set-to between L. and F. in 
Berlin can't possibly concern us, and F. has behaved too well for 
us to drop him on some pretext or other just to please L. The 
only thing to do, presumably, is to give the Dark Heraclitus' 1 a 
mysterious intimation or two to the effect that 'reactionary' cuts no 
ice in foreign policy, in which field much greater 'jackasses' than 
Fischel are of service, provided they know all the ropes. How 
horrorstruck our far-sighted revolutionary thinker and pragmatic 
Royal Prussian court democrat would be, if he heard that 
Urquhart proposes to extend the power of the Crown. So nice a 
speculative distinction may be drawn, by the way, between this 
separate field of FOREIGN POLICY, on the one hand, and internal 
policy, on the other, that you'll certainly enjoy pointing out to him 
how, in foreign policy, the subjectively reactionary is, for the 
nonce, objectively revolutionary, thereby putting the man's mind 
at rest. Just help the man make the transition and he'll be satisfied 
theoretically, however much our connection with Fischel may rile

him in practice, and rile him the more for the knowledge that it 
was Fischel who saw to my pamphlet.3 
You might also observe for his benefit how revolutionary a 
mode of action it is, first to deprive the Germans, or get others to 
deprive them, of their best territory and the very basis of their 
national existence on the pretext that the present rulers of that 
territory are reactionaries, and then to expect revolution. And it 
mightn't be a bad idea to say something about superstitious belief 
in the revolutionary initiative of the crapauds!' The whole to be 
presented in the usual allusive manner so that he'll have to chew it 
over for the space of four weeks and then wipe the slate clean by 
writing you a four-page letter to which you won't reply. 
My coming up here on Saturday' was most useful. By Sunday I 
had already found out a great deal that is important to 
negotiations, and now have the draft contract to study.

For the past three weeks I have been suffering from a liver

I have got into such arrears with my work that the next few weeks

start contributing immediately to the new newspaper." Could you 
send me one or two numbers of the same for my perusal? And 
likewise give me some advice about the PRINCIPAL  MANAGERS  of the new 
undertaking? Black, red and gold is a couleur which can now be used 
to some effect vis-à-vis other countries. 170 
I recommend to you Mr Georg Lommel, 85 rue du Nord, Café 
Court, Genève, for the post of Geneva correspondent of the 
paper. 
Geneva is now a major seat of Bonapartist intrigue, and 
Lommel is well informed. I am convinced that he would agree to 
act as your correspondent on very reasonable terms. 
Ad vocemb Abel: Many thanks for this discovery.17' Who is Abel? 
You would greatly oblige me by sending a few more details; 
indeed I should like to have this information as soon as possible. 
I have doubtless already told you that the Chief Public 
Prosecutor' has upheld the Public Prosecutor's"1 dismissal of my 
libel action on the grounds that no 'public interest' would be 
served thereby.e So the civil action will now be going ahead. 
You will have seen in the papers that Reuter, the Jewish 
confidence trickster who owns the London telegraphic bureau, was 
presented to the Queen. 1 Quite simply the facts are as follows: 
Reuter's factotum—he himself being barely able to write gram­
matically—is the Viennese refugee Sigmund Engländer. This 
Engländer was previously in Paris, where he contributed to a 
lithographic news bulletin run under the auspices of the then 
minister of police 8; at the same time, he was a French moucharda 
When the Oriental war' broke out, he was expelled from Paris 
because it had been discovered that he was a Russian spy. He then 
came to London where he eventually entered the service of 
Reuter, with whom he had already had connections earlier on. 
Now, since the entire European press is controlled by Reuter via 
his telegraphic bureau, and the telegraphic bureau by the Russian 
embassy via Engländer, you will understand why Pam presented 
Reuter to the Queen. So far as I know, the presentation had 
something to do with Russia's entry into the Austro-Prussian 
Telegraphic Union. I have informed Collet of the FACTS. Perhaps 
you for your own part may be able to make use of them. 
I am, Sir,

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN BERLIN 
[London, about 2 June 1860]c 
Dear Lassalle, 
For some three weeks past I've been suffering from a liver 
complaint, which has prevented me from doing any [kind] ' of work, 
and which I haven't completely shaken off yet. This state of affairs 
makes me a very poor letter-writer. 
Well, before I reply to your letter, just one or two preliminaries. 
The Daily Telegraph's, Berlin correspondent is called Abel. Can you 
provide me with any particulars about this individual? 
Schwarck, the Chief Public Prosecutor, has in turn dismissed the 
criminal action against the National-Zeitung on Appeal on the 
grounds that no 'public interest' would be served thereby. It won't 
be long now before the civil action is preferred. 
Now for your letter. 
I shall not come to Berlin.172  I did not go to Cologne and all I 
knew of the sworn evidence given there by Stieber was derived 
from the reports in the Kölnische Zeitung? It is upon those reports 
that my critique in the Revelations'" is based. Hence I could be of 
no use as a witness in this case. If they want to have me testify 
about one point or another, I am prepared to make a deposition

(as apparently has often been done by other refugees) at the 
Prussian Embassy in London. 
During the early stages of the Eichhoff case Juch, the editor of 
the Hermann, appealed to me for help in this respect. 1'3 I gave 
him the Revelations, recommended that Schneider II be sum­
moned as witness from Cologne, and pointed out the necessity of 
questioning Hirsch, who was in gaol in Hamburg. The latter 
interrogation would seem to have been conducted most ineptly. 
Indeed, it would be absolutely essential to convey Hirsch bodily to 
Berlin to act as a witness. Only in this event could there be a 
proper CROSS-EXAMINATION that would publicly lay bare the whole 
disgraceful operation, since Hirsch was fully initiated into these 
mysteries of Stieber-Goldheim-Greif-Fleury. 
Another essential witness would be Cherval (Joseph Cramer), at 
present in Paris. As he did a bolt from Aachen after forging some 
bills,  Prussia could undoubtedly demand his extradition. But the 
government will take good care not to do so. Apart from that, he's 
a French mouchard* and therefore under Bonaparte's protection. 
Most of the other people whom it might be important to 
examine are in America. Only one is still over here, a certain de 
L'Aspée from Wiesbaden, who is employed as an  INTERPRETER  by the 
English police. I have taken the necessary steps [to arjrange a 
meeting [with him] and shall see whether he is willing either to 
[travel] to Berlin [or] to submit to questioning at the Prussian 
Embassy. In 1853, [he] sent The Times an article denouncing 
[St]ieber. The article was suppressed owing to Bunsen's interven­
tion and did not [appear]. 
I shall [now] adduce a few points, which you may, perhaps, be 
able to put to use. I wrote the Revelations immediately after the 
Cologne trial was over. However, I subsequently made further 
investigations into this casus, which is of special interest to me. But 
first let me say what a capital idea it was of Eichhoff's to cite the 
chief fellow culprits, Goldheim and Greif,  as witnesses for the 
defence. As things stand, the only way to get at Stieber et cie. 
would be for the government to institute an inquiry into the 
Cologne trial. But it'll take good care not to. 
Stieber (see page 10 of my Revelations)h is said to have testified 
on oath in Cologne that 'his attention had been drawn' to 'the 
conspiracy's archives' in the keeping of Oswald Dietz in London by 
the copy of 'the papers found on Nothjung' which were sent to 
a police spy - h See present edition, Vol. 11, p. 405. 

=====第183页=====
72. Marx to Ferdinand Lassalle. About 2 June 1860 147 
him in London from police headquarters in Berlin. A mere 
examination of the Cologne records, which must necessarily 
contain the papers found on Nothjung, should be enough to 
refute this perjured evidence. 
The actual state of affairs was as follows: Cherval (Joseph 
Cramer) was the Paris correspondent of the Willich-Schapper 
Leaguem  and, as such, corresponded with Oswald Dietz. At the 
same time, Cherval was an agent of the Prussian ambassador in 
Paris,  Prince Hatzfeldt. Not only did he denounce Dietz, as 
secretary of his London committee, to Hatzfeldt, he also wrote 
Dietz letters that were intended for use as evidence later on. 
Stieber and Greif (as Greif himself told Hirsch in Fleury's presence) 
acted on Hatzfeldt's information. What they found out through 
Reuter was where Dietz lived, after which Fleury, on Stieber's 
orders, burgled Dietz's lodgings accompanied by Reuter. This, too, 
is known to Hirsch. 
En passant, the following circumstance may be relevant, with 
which Mr Hirsch is familiar. Fleury had made exact copies of the 
letters stolen at Reuter's and given them to Hirsch to read. Among 
those letters was one from Hanover written by Stechan in which 
he mentioned a remittance of 30 talers for the refugees. Stieber 
(together with his friend Wermuth in Hanover) altered this to 530 
talers for the leaders. Stechan, who, so far as I know, is now in 
Edinburgh, could perhaps swear an affidavit to this effect. Stieber 
(according to the Köln. Zeit., see p. 11 of the Revelations*) further 
stated on oath that the Dietz archives had arrived in Berlin on 
5 August 1851, having been sent to him from London. The IACI is 
that Stieber took those 'archives' with him from London to Paris 
on 20 July 1851. This is a point which the above-mentioned 
L'Aspée could, if he so wished, corroborate on oath. 
Mr Greif testified on oath in Berlin that he did not know 
Hirsch, or knew him only very slightly. The FACT is that Hirsch was 
introduced to Fleury by Greif at 39 Brewer Street, Golden Square, 
the private residence of Alberts (then, as now, secretary to the 
Prussian Embassy in London) at that time, after Greif had first got 
Hirsch to give him a report on the activities of the revolutionary 
emigration. From that time on,  Greif,  Fleury, and Hirsch worked 
together (under the direction of Greif), and were, in particular, 
jointly responsible for composing the forged minute-book. 
The month of April 1853 found Goldheim and Stieber back in 
London where they were intent on engineering a link between

Kossuth's mysterious gunpowder plot and the Berlin conspiracy 
(Ladendorf's). 175 At that time (i.e. many months after the Cologne 
trial),  Hirsch constantly accompanied them in London and worked 
together with them. 
Considering that the police have acknowledged their Fleury in 
court, let me provide a character sketch of these Prussian agents in 
London: The said Fleury is called Krause, and is the son of 
Krause the cobbler, who was executed in Dresden some 22 to 25 
years ago for the murder of Countess Schönberg and her maid. 
Some time after the Cologne trial, this same Fleury-Krause was 
convicted of forgery in London and sentenced to two or three 
years in the HULKS. Having now served his sentence, he is once 
again up to his old activities. 
The French plot (complot allemand-français) 108 was engineered 
under Stieber's direction by Cherval in company with  Greif, 
Fleury, Beckmann, Sommer and the French spy, Lucien de la 
Hodde (under the name of Duprez). At Cherval's instigation, 
Greif (who, like Stieber, swears he does not know the Franco-
Prussian spies Cherval and Gipperich) went to North Germany 
where he was to find out the abode of a certain tailor named Tietz 
and obtain possession of the letters Cherval had written him on 
police instructions. He went to the home of Tietz's betrothed in 
Hamburg, saying he had come 'as a friend' of Tietz's and would 
take into safe keeping any potentially dangerous correspondence. 
However, the coup misfired. 
Greif also corresponded with Maupas, through de la Hodde-
Duprez, about the release of Cherval and Gipperich. No sooner 
had Cherval arrived in London than he was taken on by Greif at a 
regular salary of £1 10s a week. In particular, Greif sent -him to 
Jersey to prepare a major political conspiracy there. Subsequently, 
the association between Greif and Cherval came to an end. If 
Mr Hirsch so wishes, he can affirm all these matters on oath. They 
are important, not only because Greif has again perjured  himself, 
but also because they concern the relationship between Cherval and 
Stieber and the 'veracity' of the statements made at Cologne by 
Stieber in respect of Cherval. At the very time when Stieber swore 
in Cologne that he knew nothing of the whereabouts, etc, of 
Cherval (see p. 27 of the Revelations*), Cherval was cooperating 
with Greif,  who himself was acting on Stieber's orders. But the 
case could be legally proven only, of course, by obtaining 
depositions from Hirsch (who might perhaps talk in open court) 
a See present edition, Vol. 11, p. 418.

and from Cherval (who cannot be got hold of). Needless to say, 
Alberts, secretary to the Embassy, won't speak; nor will de la 
Hodde, Beckmann, Maupas, etc. 
Hirsch and Fleury (the latter had rented a lithographic press at 
Stanbury's Printing Works, Fether [Fetter] Lane, Fleet Street, 
London, to that end) had been instructed by Greif to produce 
leaflets, such as 'To the Rural Proletariat', 'To the Children of the 
People', etc., which Greif sent to the Prussian government as 
emanating from the Marx party.

Hamburg in the course of the communist trial at Cologne, 
Hinckeldey sent a courier to the Prussian Embassy in London with 
the request that someone be found to take over Haupt's role, and 
to 'swear' Haupt's denunciations before the Assizes. The Police 
Presidium, he said, would give a reward of a thousand talers. In 
his letter, Hinckeldey wrote that the very existence of the political 
police depended upon the outcome of this trial. Hirsch, having 
first consulted Fleury (out of the 'noblest' motives, as he himself 
subsequently said), declared himself willing. Everything was well in 
train when Fleury returned with tidings of the Prussian Embassy's 
refusal. A further communication from Hinckeldey read: 
'The State Prosecutor hopes that thanks to the happy constitution of the jury it 
will be possible to get a verdict of guilty even without extraordinary measures, and he' 
(Hinck.) 'therefore asks you not to trouble yourselves further.' 
For the same reason, the order previously sent to Beckmann, 
the Prussian spy in Paris, bidding him come to Cologne and 
corroborate Stieber's statements regarding the complot allemand-
français was countermanded. 
But now we come to the most curious part of the story, which is 
also perfectly known to Mr Hirsch and is typical of Stieber no less 
than of Goldheim. 
Fleury had learned that I intended to have the actual 
handwriting of the alleged signatories of the minutes (W. Lieb 
knecht, Rings, and Ulmer) officially authenticated in London. He 
knew that a refugee called Becker lived in the same house 
as Willich. He therefore wrote the following letter in Becker's 
name: 
'To the Royal Presidium in Berlin; 
dated from London 
'It is the intention of Marx and his friends here to discredit the signatures on 
the League Minutes by having handwriting specimens legally authenticated. These

specimens are to be produced in the Court of Assizes as the really authentic ones. 
'Everyone familiar with English laws knows that on this point they can be 
manipulated and that a person who vouches for the authenticity of a thing does 
not actually give any true guarantee. 
'The person who gives you this information does not recoil from giving you his 
name in a matter like this where the truth is at stake. Becker, 4 Litchfield Street.' 
Stieber had declared before the Assizes at Cologne that he had 
had the minute-book for a fortnight (before producing it in court), 
and had duly deliberated before putting it to use; he further 
declared that it had reached him through a courier,  Greif. 
Mr Goldheim, on the other hand, in a letter to the Prussian Embassy 
in London, said: 
'The minute-book was produced so late only in order to avoid scrutiny as to its 
authenticity. 
The letter signed 'Becker' was addressed to the Police Presidium 
in Berlin. Had it really emanated from Becker, therefore, it must 
have gone to Berlin. Instead, the letter went to Goldheim, the 
police official, at the Frankfurter Hof in Cologne, and a cover to 
that letter to the Police Presidium in Berlin containing a note: 
'Herr Stieber in Cologne will give a complete explanation as to its 
use.'  Thus, Stieber knew to what end the letter had been forged. 
Moreover, Fleury had written expressly to Goldheim on the 
subject. 
Thus,  between Fleury, Goldheim, Stieber and Prussian Police 
Presidium there was tacit collusion over the forgery. 
(Stieber did not make use of the letter, having already been 
ccftnpelled to drop the minute-book since, independently of the 
authentications provided by me, Schneider II had not only 
discovered other signatures of Liebknecht's and Rings' in Cologne, 
but had also concluded from a much earlier letter of mine that the 
forger was Hirsch. Stieber got wind of the fact that Schneider had 
compared Liebknecht's, etc., signatures at the Record Office, and 
that other counsel had done the same. It was then that, at the 
following session, he came out with the imaginary H. Liebknecht 
(see pp. 38-40 of Revelations").) 
Stieber knew the minute-book to be a fake. Why otherwise 
should he fear authentication of the genuine signatures? 
On 29 October, Goldheim arrived in London. Stieber had sent 
him ithere to confer on the spot with Fleury and Greif and devise 
a See present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 427-29.

some coup that might save  the  minute-book.  He had to  return 
empty-handed, having told Fleury that, rather than compromise 
the chiefs  of police, Stieber  was  resolved,  if needs  be, to  expose 
him, Fleury. 
As a last recourse, Fleury  now  brought Hirsch  a specimen  of 
handwriting  for him to use to  copy  out a  statement, sign  the  latter 
with Liebknecht's name,  and  then attest  it before  the  LORD MAYOR 
while falsely declaring himself (Hirsch)  to be  Liebknecht.  On 
handing Hirsch  the said specimen  to be  copied, Fleury told  him 
that the  handwriting  was  that  of the  person  who had  written  the 
minute-book,  and  that Goldheim  had brought  it (the  specimen) 
back from Cologne with  him. 
(Hence  it follows that  the  minute-book produced  in Cologne  was 
not the  same  as had  been written  by Hirsch  and Fleury. Stieber 
himself  had had it  copied.  The  chief difference between  it and the 
one fabricated  by Fleury  and  Hirsch —a few  insignificant altera­
tions apart—lay  in the  fact that, whereas  the  minutes provided  by 
Fleury  had  been unsigned, signatures  had  been appended  to those 
submitted  by Stieber.) 
Hirsch copied  out the  statement  in handwriting  as similar  as 
possible  to that  of the  specimen. (This last  was  still  in his 
possession when  he left London.)  The  statement  was to the  effect 
that the  undersigned,  i.e.  Liebknecht, declared  the  authentication 
of his  signature obtained  by Marx  and Co. to be  false,  and  this,  his 
signature,  to be the  only genuine  one.  While  en route  to the  LORD 
MAYOR, Hirsch declared that  he would  not  take  an oath before 
him, whereupon Fleury said  he would  do so  himself.  First  he 
called  in at the  Prussian consulate (where,  of course,  he was 
well known)  and got the  Prussian consul  to endorse  his handwrit­
ing (as that  of Liebknecht). Then, together with Hirsch,  he betook 
himself to the  LORD MAYOR  for the purpose of attestation. The  LORD 
MAYOR, however, asked  for  guarantees, which Fleury  was  unable  to 
provide,  and  thus  no oath  was  taken.  (One day  later—but trop 
tard" —Fleury obtained credentials from  a lawyer.) 
All this dirty business came  to light  in an  affidavit Hirsch swore 
before Jardine,  the Bow  Street magistrate.  The  affidavit  was  sent 
to Göbel,  the president  of the  Appellate Court,  and two  copies 
went  off simultaneously  to Schneider  II and the  lawyer Esser. 
Whether Hirsch  can be  conveyed bodily from Hamburg  to 
Berlin  to testify  in open session  and  confront Stieber-Goldheim-
Greif,  I cannot  say. The  present régime being what  it is,  there  can

be no question of getting hold of Cherval—now, what is more, an 
avowed 'civiliser' and 'LIBERATOR'. 
In the case of my own testimony, I could not, of course, without 
being guilty of all manner of indiscretions, in any way show how 
one fact or another had come to my knowledge. Moreover, such 
evidence would not constitute  proof. 
The trial would be altogether straightforward were the govern­
ment de bonne foi. 3 As things are, it is most difficult to conduct. 
Now I come to Fischel.b 
My relations with David Urquhart and his followers (I won't say 
party because, apar.«' from the sect which holds him to be a 
prophet in all disciplines, Urquhart can, in his own proper domain 
of FOREIGN POLICY, boast supporters among all English parties, from 
the Tories to the Chartists) have been amicable since the 
appearance, in 1853, of my first anti-Palmerston pamphlet.c Ever 
since, there has been a constant interchange, they providing me 
with information, I making unpaid contributions to their Free Press 
(e.g. my Revelations of the diplomatic history of the 18th century, or 
again, the Progress of Russia in Central Asia,176 etc.), and placing at 
their disposal my personal knowledge of Russian agents such as 
Bangya, etc. Now, Fischel is the Urquhartites' recognised and, as it 
were, official agent in Berlin and my knowledge of his activities 
there is confined to what I have heard about the Portfolio.26 This 
was how I came into contact with Fischel (it was only by chance 
that I ran into him at a London newspaper office,d  on which 
occasion I asked him to convey my regards to you). He has carried 
out various commissions for myself and Engels in Berlin. We have 
never exchanged so much as a word, either verbally or in writing, 
on the subject of internal policy, nor for that matter have I done 
so with Urquhart since the time when I told him once and for all 
that I was a revolutionist, and he retorted no less frankly that all 
revolutionists were agents or DUPES of the Petersburg cabinet. 
In the letters we have exchanged with Fischel he has always 
observed the utmost discretion and confined himself solely to the 
one field of foreign policy in which we are in accord with the 
Urquhartites. 
You will have read Urquhart's writings, and hence it would be 
otiose for me (aside from the strain already involved in writing so 
long a letter in my present state of health) to embark on an 
analysis of this highly complex figure here. He is, I grant you, 
a in good faith - h See this volume, pp. 136-37, 141-45. - c Lord Palmerston-
d Presumably that of The Free Press.

subjectively reactionary (romantic) (though not, indeed, in the 
sense of any real reactionary party but, as it were, metaphysically 
so); this in no way precludes the movement in foreign policy, of 
which he is the head, from being objectively revolutionary. 
The fact that some of his German followers such as Bûcher, 
Fischel, etc. (I don't know the latter's Moskowitertum, but I know 
what's in it without reading it), have chosen to adopt some of his 
'Anglo-Saxon' fads—which, by the by, are not without a kind of 
perverse critical sense—, is to me a matter of complete indiffer­
ence,  just as in a war against Russia, say, it would be a matter of 
indifference to you whether, in firing on the Russians, the motives 
of your neighbour in the firing-line were black, red and gold or 
revolutionary. Urquhart is a power, of which Russia is afraid. He is 
the only official personage in England who has the courage and 
honesty to affront PUBLIC OPINION. He's the only one of them who is 
incorruptible (whether by money or ambition). Finally, and strange 
to say, I have so far encountered none but honest men among his 
followers, and hence feel bound to regard Fischel as such until I 
have proof of the contrary. 
As for F.'s relations with the Duke of Gotha, a I have very good 
reason to believe that they are not venal. Seeing that this Gotha 
chap belongs to the English dynasty, which Urquhart is using 
against Palmerston and ministerial usurpation generally ('Why 
doesn't anyone ever shoot at cabinet ministers?' Humboldt asks, 
presaging such usurpation), what could suit him better than to 
promote anti-Russian and anti-Palmerston sentiment in Germany 
in his (Gotha's) name? This is why Fischel's pamphlet, Despoten und 
Revolutionäre, was translated into English as The Duke of Coburg's 
Pamphlet, and was thought important enough by Palmerston to 
warrant a personal reply in the form of a pamphlet (anonymous), 
which has greatly compromised him. 1'7 For Palmerston had hitherto 
made the unfortunate House of Coburg the scapegoat for his 
Russophilia, and the pamphlet compelled him to abandon this FALSE 
PRETEXT. 
It is very possible, indeed probable, that Fischel's anti-
Palmerstonianism is of little significance in Berlin. On the other 
hand, so far as England (and thus par ricochet1' Germany) is 
concerned, it is important in that this controversy is being skilfully 
exploited by the Urquhartites and magnified into the German view 
of Palmerston, for the furtherance of the English controversy. 
a Ernst II - b indirectly

154 72. Marx to Ferdinand Lassalle. About 2 June 1860 
Hence, in the war that we, together with the Urquhartites, are 
conducting against Russia, Palmerston and Bonaparte, and in 
which people of all parties and  classes  in every capital of Europe as 
far as Constantinople are playing their part, Fischel, too, is a 
component. On the other hand, I have never exchanged so much 
as a syllable with Bücher, because to do so would have been 
pointless. Were he living in Berlin instead of London, it would be 
quite a different matter. 
Should we enter into a revolutionary phase in Germany, this will, 
of course, put an end to diplomacy—of a kind, by the by, that 
entails not the least concession on either side nor even a shadow of 
pretence. And even then this English connection will be useful to 
us. 
Come to that, it goes without saying that, in foreign policy, 
there's little to be gained by using such catchwords as 'reactionary' 
and 'revolutionary'. In Germany now there is no such thing as a 
revolutionary party, and to me the most loathsome form of reaction 
is Royal Prussian court democracy as practised, say, by the 
National-Zeitung and also, to some extent (their acclaim of that 
scoundrel Vincke, the Regent,a  etc.) by the Volks-Zeitung. 
At all events, the Urquhartites have the advantage of being 
'educated' in foreign policy, so that the ignorant members obtain 
their inspiration from the educated ones; the advantage, too, of 
pursuing a definite goal, the fight against Russia, and being 
engaged in a life and death struggle with that mainstay of Russian 
diplomacy, DOWNING STREET AT LONDON.178 Let them imagine, if they 
wish, that this struggle will result in the establishment of 
'Anglo-Saxon' conditions. It is up to us revolutionaries to go on 
using them so long as we have need of them. This does not 
prevent us from actually knocking them on the head wherever 
they threaten to frustrate our internal policy. The Urquhartites 
have never reproached me for also writing under my own name 
in the Chartist newspaper that was their bugbear until its 
demise—Ernest Jones's People's Paper. E. Jones laughed at 
Urquhart's oddities, ridiculed them in his paper and yet, in that 
same paper, acknowledged his outstanding worth in the matter of 
FOREIGN POLICY. 
Finally, despite his fanatical hatred of the French Revolution 
and everything 'universal', Urquhart's romanticism is exceedingly 
liberal. The freedom of the individual, if in a very topsy-turvy

My dear Sir, 
My protracted silence was owed to two circumstances. On my 
return from Manchester I was overwhelmed with business. 
Afterward, I fell sick. I am still under medical treatment and little 
apt for writing. 
As to your affair with Mr Engels, the delay was caused by a 
second sudden departure for Germany having become necessary 
on his part. 180 On his return for Manchester he passed through 
London and told me that he would immediately settle the little 
bill. He regretted not having been able to prove more useful to 
you, but had not thought of charging you with the expenses 
incurred by the sending back of the wines.* 
I have read your bookc with much pleasure and profit. I concur 
in the main views you take of the conditions necessary for the 
restoration of Hungary, but I dissent from the apology passed on 
Bonaparte and Palmerston. The latter has, in 1848-9, betrayed 
Hungary, as well as Italy. He had before acted in the same way in 
regard to Poland; he, afterwards, treated in the same way 
Circassia. He is still what he was since 1829—a Russian agent, 
bound to the Petersburg cabinet by ties it is not in his power to cut 
through. Russia, of course, wants the destruction of the Austrian

Empire, but what she not wants is the formation of the constituent 
elements of that empire into independent and self-sustaining 
states.  A true reconstitution of Hungary would even more stand in 
the way of Russian Eastern diplomacy than tottering, vacillating 
and frightened Austria. I should have wished, in your own 
interest, and that of your country, that you had not reprinted the 
memorial to Palmerston, 181 not spoken of the true interest of 
Russia, and avoided even alluding to the dismemberment of 
Turkey. As it is, you have estranged exactly that portion of 
English politicians which was most willing to do you justice, and 
was least influenced by Kossuth's sycophants. (Kossuth has in these 
latter times given out—through his agents—and even succeeded 
in forcing the opinion into some weekly papers, that you were 
intriguing against him, because he was a Republican, in principle 
at least, while you belonged to the 'Constitutional and Aristocratic 
party'.) 
You excuse the liberty I have taken in frankly stating the points 
on which I cannot but dissent from you. The interest I take in 
your writings and your doings will, I hope, serve as a sufficient 
excuse. When will you come again over to London? 
Yours truly

acknowledges the truth of the somewhat eccentric compliments I

a rather melancholic, melodramatic, and depressed mood of 
mind.

'You will have seen the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung of 8 June. Reading 
between the lines, one perceives in its Berne report, presumably written by 
Tscharner, co-editor of the  Bund,  a denunciation by the Vogtians to their lord and 
master in Paris and thence, indirectly, to the Federal authorities in Berne, likewise 
to Germany's princely courts. It's the same old tale of conspiracy—German 
demagogues trying to stir up trouble between France and Germany in order to 
make possible a central republic. Vogtian intrigue no longer cuts any ice at all, either 
in Federal circles or in Geneva; nevertheless, it still appears to have sortie effect on the 
limited intelligence of the German princes. This conspiratorial bogey held up to them 
by Badinguet"> 3 is actually said to have induced the timid fellows to grant him the 
audience in Baden-Baden he so ardently desired. 183  For the past fortnight the 
Allgemeine has been quietly discarding the choicest of the notes I sent it from Savoy 
and Turin, and Vogt, who returned here ten days ago, has told a worker that a stop 
will soon be put to the activities of the fellows responsible for the scrawls in the 
German papers and that people will be in for more surprises before long.' 
A pamphlet by About has now come out in Paris: Napoleon III et 
la Prusse. 3 In the first place SOFT SAWDER for Germany. Her great 
men, he says, are all of them HOUSEHOLD WORDS in France, e.g. 
'Goethe, Schiller, Humboldt, Vogt, Beethoven, Heine, Liebig, etc' 
France is completely disinterested, although constantly provoked. 
Then came some rubbish about German unity being brought 
about with the help of France. Then a highly superficial review of 
conditions obtaining in Prussia at present. (Even the Niegolewski 
affair is discussed at length! 184) The only way she can save herself 
is to side with France's 'democratic principle' against Austria's 
feudalism. In other words, this democratic principle consists in 
basing princely dictatorship on 'suffrage universel'. Satis superque! b 
However, it's capital that Royal Prussian court democracy should 
now be getting into a nasty fix; let's hope that the Prince Regent,' 
too, will soon have compromised himself sufficiently.

ENGELS  TO MARX 185 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,]  20 June  1860 
Dear Moor, 
Amicus* Lommel would certainly appear  TO  DRAW  RATHER  LARGELY  ON 
HIS IMAGINATION  in ascribing  the  chief part  in the  Baden-Baden 
business  to the  Bonapartist denunciations.b  But it's  undoubtedly 
quite correct that there's something behind  the  business  and  that 
Vogt, Bonaparte  and Co. are  also resorting  to this stratagem. 
How nice  it is  that  the  Little Germans' National Association-
mongering24 should  now be  opportunely depicted  in About's 
pamphlet0  as virtually promoting Bonapartist interests. Presuma­
bly our  friend Izzy will soon  be making  a change  of front  now; as 
a result  of this pamphlet,  the  gentlemen will either reveal 
themselves  as Bonapartists  or else find themselves  in a  considera­
ble dilemma with that Prussian Germany  of theirs. 
I happened  to come  by the old  Danish Kjämpe-Viser A; very nice 
stuff in places along with  a great deal  of rubbish. Here  is one  that

•l Herr Oluf fares both  far and  wide, 
To fetch  the  wedding-guests  he doth ride. 
Maidens dance  on the  green land, 
Four  and  five,  a blithe band. 
The Elf  King's daughter gives  him her  hand. 
Welcome, Herr  Oluf, why  wouldst thou flee? 
Step into  the  ring  and  dance with  me. 
But dance  I neither will  nor may. 
Tomorrow dawns  my  wedding  day. 
Oh list, Herr  Oluf,  come dance with  me, 
Two buckskin boots  I'll give  to thee. 
Two buckskin boots  to fit you  well, 
Two gilded spurs  for a  magic spell. 
But dance  I neither will  nor mav, etc. 
Oh list, Herr  Oluf,  come dance with  me, 
A silken shirt  I'll give  to thee. 
A shirt  all shining white  so fine. 
My mother bleached  il with pale moonshine. 
But dance  I neither will  nor may, etc. 
Oh list. Herr  Oluf,  come dance with  me, 
A pile  of gold  I'll give  to thee. 
Gladly  I'd take your gold away, 
But dance  I neither dare  nor may. 
An thou, Herr  Oluf,  dance  not  with  me, 
Sickness  and  plague shall follow thee. 
And then  she  touched  him on the  chest. 
Never such pain  had  clutched  his  breast. 
She helps  him,  half-swooning,  his  mount  to bestride: 
Now get  thee hence  to thy  fair bride. 
As to his own  door  he drew near, 
His mother  was  trembling there with fear. 
Tell me  quickly,  oh quickly,  my son, 
Why  are thy  looks  so pale  and  wan? 
How should they  not be  pale  and  wan? 
'Tis from  the Elf  King's realm  I tome. 
Oh list, dear  son I  love  so well, 
What  to your bride  am I to  tell? 
Say to the  forest  I am  hound, 
To exercise  my  horse  and  hound. 
Next morning, when  it was  scarcely  day, 
There came  the  bride with  her  company. 
They poured  the  mead, they poured  the  wine. 
Where  is Herr  Oluf,  bridegroom mine?

Dear Becker, 
Would you be so kind as to forward the enclosed letter to 
Lommel?4'2 I am sending it through you because I only have an 
address for Lommel in Geneva which no longer appears to be 
certain. At any rate, in his last few letters L. has neither mentioned 
the letters I sent him, nor answered my inquiry regarding the failure 
to arrive (should have come weeks ago) of a parcel he had advised 
me of. 
Give Schily my kindest regards. I would ask you to arrange the 
letter Ranickel wrote him to be sent me as soon as possible. l 
It was not until a day or two ago that I became capable of work 
again and I am still to a certain extent convalescent. 
The publishers of the Deutsche Zeitung, which is to come out in 
Berlin at the beginning of July, have approached me through a 
third person' 1 about contributions. I have not yet given them a

me to be 'pro-National Association'24  and, or so a friend in Berlin"

its stand. Write and let me know if you and Schily would act as 
joint correspondents for the paper, which evidently has fonds, 
should you get an invitation to this effect either direct from Berlin 
or via London! I should like to have an answer about the matter by 
return, because I would not, of course, drop any hints to this effect

CHANCELLOR  OF L HE EXCHEQUER, the wretched Economist has said virtually 
nothing about India. Nor should you forget (although it won't yet be 
necessary this week) to let me have  ABOUT  a quarto page or so on the

fellow's point of view it is not altogether bad. Has some  FACTS  about 
Vogt's  cowardice. 
Jakob's passages relating  to ourselves  are as  follows. 
A friend writes  obligingly: 
'It is disgraceful that  in his  triumph over  the  Augsburg Zeitung 11 and 
the "Brimstone Gang", 1'3 this  man  Vogt should also drag Venedey  in his  wake' 
(p. 4). 
'No more than  a word  or two  pro domo.b  Could Karl Vogt have forgotten that  all 
the stale, insipid morsels  he dished  up to his  readers  in his  Erklärung 11 against 
me—"noble Jakob", "blond soul", "imperial teardrop"  and  sundry other epithets— 
had been dished  up ten  years  ago  fresh, fragrant  and  seasoned with  the  spice  of 
wit by Marx, Engels  and company  in the  Rhenish newspaper. d Do I  have  to remind 
him that  in the  self-same article,  'Der  Reichsregent', e which  the  Augsburger 
[Allgemeine Zeitung] used  as the  point  of departure  for its  accusations against Vogt, 
this "dirty gang,  a handful  of malicious vagabonds  in London",  as Vogt describes 
it, gave battle along lines identical  to those adopted  by  Vogt  in his Erklärung 
against myself? Nevertheless, Karl Vogt  did not  feel that this prevented  him  from 
accusing  me of  having borrowed from Messrs Marx, Engels  and company  the 
"defamatory statements"  I made about  him.  Vogt  is well aware that,  in jibing  at 
me, he is  simply repeating their words'  (p. 7). 
'This pamphlet  of Vogt's' about  his  lawsuit  has all the air of a  triumphal march 
and, indeed, Karl Vogt —not that  he  himself appears  the  more justified  in 
consequence—has consigned  to  London  in complete disarray  the A. A. and 
likewise  the  "London Brimstone Gang'"  (p. 6).

Dear Frederick, 
I didn't read about Izzy's adventure.3 
You will see from the enclosed letter from Weber how rottenly 
the Prussian scoundrels are behaving.188 It now seems that there is 
nothing to be expected from the High Court, either. 
What splendid jurisprudence! First, I'm forbidden my 'libel 
action' because it is not in the interests of the Prussian 
government. And then the 'action for injuria' is not allowed 
to proceed in public because there is no 'indictable offence' to 
hand. This is tantamount to 'pleading' on behalf of the National-
Zeitung. 
How liberal, by contrast, Bavaria turned out to be with regard to 
Vogt. 189 That's 'Prussian progress' for you. 
Get Heckscher to publish another short notice in the Reform. 
The way the Prussians handled the case must at least be brought 
to the attention of the public. 
From the evidence I sent Weber and which Weber included in 
his indictment it was apparent to the scoundrelly gang that the 
National-Zeitung would inevitably have been convicted had the case 
been allowed to 'come up'. Hence all this dirty chicanery.

[Manchester, after 28 June 1860] 
Dear Moor, 
Encl. an article on the  RIFLE  parade 3; the subject occurred to me 
just when I was about to despair. Go over it thoroughly; I haven't 
the time to do so  myself. 
Those Prussians really do have a 'nice style' just now. Since the 
action against the National-Zeitung could only serve to introduce a 
strident note of discord into the general constitutional harmony, 
the case must be stopped at all costs. The judges, 'and there still 
are such in Berlin',192 are being got at and I'm quite positive that 
Mr Weber has been got at, too. It's quite plain to me from the 
whole tone of his letters. All the more need, then, to press on with 
the pamphletb so that the noble Prussians can be shown that they 
are not, after all, able to suppress such things. Those swine. Might 
it be, perhaps, that they quietly affected such a liberal attitude 
towards me,' in order to behave all the more abominably to 
yourself? 
If possible, I shall do Bohemia this evening.0 Incidentally, you 
should devise the pamphlet—difficult though this may be—in 
such a way as to make it absolutely impossible for the Prussians to 
ban it. And above all be quick, for it is probable that between now 
and 1861 the daydream of peace will gain ascendency and hence 
interest in high treason wane. Do try and be a bit superficial for 
once,  so that you get it done in time.

Dear Frederick, 
As regards Meissner, the thing strikes me as somewhat dubious, 
since he is pretty well hand in glove with Vogt and Co. At any 
rate,  I shan't send him a manuscript 3 unless he concludes a 
contract beforehand. 
What about Bohemia? I must have it now, otherwise I shall be 
held up. Anyway, it need only be  brief,  you know.b 
I should also like you to devote a few sentences to a discussion 
of the military inanities contained in the following utterances of 
Falstaff Vogt's.c 
1. This man, who has made such a detailed study of the 
relationship between 'Energy and Matter',193 maintains that, within 
their present boundaries, the United Danubian Principalities are 
capable—qua independent kingdom—of forming a 'bulwark' 
against Russia and, indeed, of withstanding the Russians, Aus-
trians and Turks. 
2. As the main proof of Badinguet'slb3 altruism and policy of 
non-conquest he puts forward the argument that, after the 
'glorious' Crimean campaign/ he did not annex either 'Russian' or 
'Turkish' territory. 
I am still not yet quite fit. One day, I feel a bit better, the next

After sundry adventures, which I shall relate some other time,

via Cologne. I already have the consignment note (railway) from 
Geneva. 
A couple of days ago I had a letter from Eccarius in which he 
told me that his tailoring had come to an end, i.e. the state of his 
health did not permit him to carry on with it. The doctor had said 
that he couldn't help him. What he needed was a change of air, 
etc. Accordingly, I have rented a lodging for him in this 
neighbourhood at my own expense (away from his  FAMILY,  OF COURSE, 
who are staying at their old place); he takes his meals with us ditto 
and has nothing to do save potter about the Heath b and send one 
article a week to Weydemeyer, who pays him 3 dollars per article. 
I hope he will pull through. I have likewise bought him some port. 
But I can't carry on like this, since at the present moment, when 
our cash box is at a low ebb, the other additional expenses he 
involves us in are already a burden. 
Couldn't you do something quickly on Garibaldi, or on the 
Prussian government, which has pushed through its army reform

kind?

be the genuinely 'magnanimous man'. Your princes, by the way, 
would seem after all to have realised that this time their heads are 
at stake; not that that is going to save them. 
Just now I am reading Ulloa's Guerre d'indépendance de l'Italie 
1848/49. Of all the military scribblings that have come my way 
(by PROFESSIONAL WRITERS) this is the most idiotic and slovenly. His 
criticism is so much hot air, the facts are distorted or not properly 
known and invariably flung together in a jumble. This Ulloa, who 
was a captain in the Neapolitan artillery in 1848, has called himself 
'general' ever since Plon-Plon took him under his wing. This gang 
pullulates with mysterious generals. Moreover, if this SPECIMEN is 
anything to go by, the Neapolitan officers must really be a rotten 
lot. 
If Garibaldi doesn't make a move soon,198 things may turn out 
badly for him, unless the business in Naples goes well, winch 
doesn't seem likely by the look of it. No doubt there'll be a few 
more defections before Milazzo and Messina, but the prospects for 
an expedition to the Continent may deteriorate. The navy won't 
place any obstacles in his way for, after all, they have no wish to 
fight Italians, but there certainly seems to be a rabid gang within 
the Neapolitan army who might resist along with the foreigners, 
nor can G. afford a defeat. If he had 10,000 reliable men he 
could, of course, finish the whole thing off in three days. He must 
now have between  5,000  and 6,000 men, not counting the 
Sicilians, of course.

simply add to the costs. It's imperative that I now send Weber his 
32 talers 3 silver groschen and 6 pfennigs so that the chap can let 
me have the documents (including his indictment) by return. I 
need them for the pamphlet, 3 which will be ready for my wife to 
copy (and she'll do it quickly) within the next 8-10 days. 
What is to be done next (I mean in the newspapers)? 
A lawsuit like this (note, e.g., the deplorable tone, reminiscent of 
newspaper polemics, of the High Court's findings) is something I 
have not come across before. These Prussian curs need a thorough 
hiding. It's a good thing, by the by, that they've supplied me with 
'material'. 
Nevertheless, the craven rabble in the High Court did see fit to 
disallow Mr Vogt's insinuations about 'extortion', etc.

Dear Moor, 
End. £5, F/L 12596 for the expenses. Lupus absolutely insisted 
on standing £4 of it. So, here we have the celebrated High Court 
of the Miller of Sanssouci. 192 I should like to know what its 
decisions and reasoning would have been, had a Prussian official 
been treated in this way instead of you. 
It would be quite useless to set the Supreme Tribunal in motion; 
but might you not seek an opinion from a  FIRST  RATE  Prussian LAWYER?

ENGELS TO JENNY MARX 203 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 15 August 1860 
Dear Mrs Marx, 
I shall do the article,3  tant bien que mal, b if I possibly can. Today 
Siebel has landed me with a young fellow from Barmen, which 
means I can't do anything; however, I shall probably get down to it 
tomorrow. By the way, it's irresponsible on Moor's part not even 
to answer my questions concerning Siebel. 204 For ten days now I've 
been putting off writing to S., and he might at least let me know 
what I am to tell the fellow. It's absurd, too, that nothing has yet 
been done about publishers; heaven knows how long negotiations 
will eventually take. Then, what with the notoriously dilatory 
methods of German printers, we'll find that we've arrived, piano 
ma sanoï in the year 1861 and there'll be no one to blame but Mr 
Moor  himself,  with his thoroughness and his failure either to do 
anything about publishers  himself,  or to put Siebel in a position to 
do something. Meanwhile, things will be in full swing everywhere 
in Europe, and the public will have lost all interest in who exactly 
belonged to the original Brimstone Gang,'' 5 how the pamphlet Zur 
Warnung***  came into being, or what is and is not true in Techow's 
letter. 56 We're forever producing truly splendid things, but take 
care to see that they never appear on time, and so they are all 
flops. 
An immediate riposte to Vogt three sheets long would,  AFTER  ALL, 
have been of far greater value than anything that has since been 
done. Insist for all you're worth on something being done—and 
done immediately—about a publisher, and on the pamphlet d being 
finished at long last. Otherwise, we shall wreck all our chances and 
ultimately find ourselves without any publisher at all. 
But now for something comical—a great secret, however, that 
mustn't go beyond the four walls of No. 9 Grafton Terrace. Just 
imagine! That ridiculous Siebel, arriving in Barmen, goes and falls 
head over heels in love with a philistine girl, c becomes engaged and 
intends to marry very shortly and settle down to a life of 
a 'The Sick Man of Austria' - b for better or worse - c slowly but surely - d  Herr

MARX TO BERTALAN SZEMERE 
IN PARIS 
London, 21 August 1860 
My dear Sir, 
I was most agreeably surprised on receiving the few lines you 
were so friendly to address to me. 
My own silence is easily accounted for. For a long time after the 
arrival of your last letter, I was labouring under the most heavy 
and distressing liver-complaint, a complaint which almost disables 
you from writing. Later on, I was told by some acquaintance of 
mine, that you sojourned at London, so that I was not sure 
whether any letter addressed to Paris was likely to find you. 
Great events, as you justly remark, have come to pass, but of all 
things the most dangerous that, in my opinion, could happen to 
Europe, would be a war between the legitimate counterrevolution, 
seated at Warsaw, and the illegitimate counterrevolution seated at the 
Tuileries. Still, we must take the situation as it is, and make the 
best of it. If Garibaldi, whose real intentions I have ascertained 
from private letters communicated to me, has momentaneously 
been forced to strike his own flag, I hope that in the coming 
spring the occasion will offer of separating once for all the cause 
of nationalities from the cause of French counterrevolution. 
I have one thing to ask of you. Kossuth has in the latter times 
worked hard to reconquer his lost influence in the United States. I 
intend baffling his manoeuvres, and would therefore feel much 
obliged, if you would communicate to me, so soon as  possible,  and as 
circumstantially as possible, the late adventures of that mock-hero. 
He has been (or is) at Paris; what was he doing there? He has 
been at Turin; what was he about? Perhaps, you could also add 
some curiously grotesque details of his first appearance in Italy, 
during the war of 1859.46 
With the events before us, it is of the highest importance, that 
on the one hand the good understanding between the German 
party of liberty and the Hungarians should be raised above every 
doubt—and I shall soon have the occasion of speaking (not by 
word of mouth, but by print3) to Germany on this point; that on 
a Marx means his book, Herr Vogt. 

=====第218页=====
182 98. Marx to Engels. 27 August 1860 
the other hand Kossuth, the would-be representative of the 
Hungarian Nation, should be disavowed on both sides. 
Here at London I still live, and shall continue to live, in my old 
house, 9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill. If you 
visit again London, I hope you will not again forget my address. 
Mrs Marx, moreover, was very disappointed in missing the 
occasion of making the personal acquaintance of a man whose 
great intellectual powers she has already become familiarised with 
by his writings. 
Yours truly

MARX TO ENGELS

[London,] 27 August 1860 
Dear Engels, 
You can attribute my long silence to the persistently frightful 
state of my liver, as a result of which I have to devote every spare 
moment to work. 
I wrote to Siebel re publishers ABOUT ten days ago 42 and await his 
reply. The long delay is due partly to my relative inability to work 
and partly to the fact that it was not till recently that I had all the 
available material. By the by, I believe that, with the exception of 
the Italian affair206  (Austria's craving for intervention was a 
Bonapartist figment), nothing more is going to happen this year 
(write SOMETHING about Garibaldi. What do you think of Bangya's 
friend Türr? 207), so there'll be an interim period during which 
pamphlets of this kind will still be readable. 
The enclosed letter from Schily will tickle you very much. Let me 
have it back. Today I sent Schily your Nice, Savoy, etc. 
ABOUT a fortnight ago I sent Dr Zimmermann (formerly 
chairman of a Prussian Municipal Court) a letter, in which I put to.

he deemed it necessary to confer with other brethren of the same 
craft in Berlin. No doubt I shall get his written opinion in the 
course of this week. I shan't allow the Prussians to get off so 
lightly. 
I'm in a great fix over money. 
Mr Weydemeyer's journal3 is already at an end; i.e. he has 
resigned from the editorial board and intends to go to New York 
as a SURVEYOR. However, his colleague11 is going to make the paper 
pay by selling it to a political party. Weydemeyer has at last come 
to realise that he's too honest for American journalism.

particularly since the disease has grown worse. From the outset,

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN AACHEN 
London, 7 September 1860 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
H aver stock Hill 
Dear Lassalle, 
I was delighted to hear from you again at last, although sorry 
that you should have no better news for me as regards your 
health. I myself am still suffering from my liver complaint; not as 
painful as gout (nor as distinguished, at least in English eyes), but 
perhaps even more disruptive when it comes to brain-work. 
There are two main reasons for postponing the publication of 
my anti-Vogt piece,3 aside from my being necessarily engaged on 
more urgent work. These are: 
1. I wanted to wait until the end of the lawsuit against the 
National-Zeitung, but have now decided not to. 
The lawsuit has passed through the following stages: First the 
Public Prosecutorb and then the Chief Public Prosecutor0 dis­
missed the action, because 'no public interest' would be served by ex 
officio intervention. Next came the civil action. The Municipal 
Court issued a 'ruling' to the effect that the action be dismissed, 
because the defamatory passages were merely (which, N.B., is 
incorrect) 'quoted'. The High Court declared the Municipal Court's 
argument to be mistaken, but arrived at the same conclusion, 
because the libellous passages neither did nor could refer to me 
(this the court proves by dint of 'misquoting'), the National-Z. had 
no intention to insult, etc. The very style of the 'ruling' is enough 
to betray the fellows' embarrassment. Now we have reached the 
Supreme Tribunal. Thus, I have now so far improved my 
knowledge of Prussian justice as to know that it is up to the 
officers of the judiciary whether a private individual gets a public 
hearing at all. For all these rulings are mere 'preliminaries' aimed 
at precluding any sort of encounter between myself and the 
Nat.-Z.  in open court. In his letters Legal Counsellor Weber, who 
appears to know nothing about my friendly relations with the 
a Herr Vogt - b Lippe - c Schwarck 

=====第223页=====
102. Marx to Ferdinand Lassalle. 7 September 1860 187 
Prussian government, throws up his hands in dismay at these 
'inexplicable' rulings. 
As you know, I instituted the lawsuit against the  Nat.-Z.  before I 
was in possession of Vogt's book.2  However, I was on the right 
track, for the  Nat.-Z.,  with commendable tact, had picked out 
all—but really all—the actionable libels (I am speaking here of 
calumnies within the meaning of the Code, not mere abuse by the 
fellows, which I did not wish to attack in court) from Vogt's 
concoction and had even, in some cases, added to their sting. But 
on every single count I found myself in the position, not of 
demanding that my opponent provide proof that it was true, but of 
myself being able to provide proof that it was false. The only 
exception was the matter of hundreds of threatening letters sent 
to Germany for the purpose of extorting money. In this instance, 
of course, it was the N.-Z.'s business to get friend Vogt to send 
them one of those threatening letters. 
Hence the courts realised that, as soon as the case came up in 
open court, the verdict must go against the N.-Z., and this, not to 
mention a legal victory for me, would indeed be 'contrary to the 
public interest'. The 'Supreme Tribunal' will find some other 
subterfuge. But in this way the Prussians are at any rate supplying 
me with material whose pleasing repercussions in the London 
press will soon be brought home to them. 
2. The real snag just now is the question of a publisher. 
The thing can't very well appear in Prussia since various 
passages relating to Stieber, etc., would lay the publisher open to 
prosecution. My negotiations in Hamburg, etc., have so far been 
of no avail. Either the chaps want to have nothing to do with it, or 
else they take the liberty of laying down conditions as to the tone 
and contents of the piece, to which I cannot, of course, agree. 
O. Meissner would have taken the thing, had he not previously 
published Demokratische Studien, to which, besides yourself and 
Grün, Vogt, along with his whole clan, Bamberger, Simon, etc., 
contributed. 
The best thing would be to get the thing printed over here and 
distributed on the Continent by some German bookseller here (as 
Vogt did from Geneva). But, unlike Vogt, I have no Bonapartist 
subsidies, with which to get the pamphlet of some 12 to 15 sheets 
printed in this country. 
. So that's how matters stand. As you will have gathered, my 
attitude towards Vogt is not as mild as German publishers would 
a Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung, Geneva, 1859.

Masses of inquiries have reached me from Switzerland and 
America about the publication of the scrawl. 
My wife sends her kind regards. For months I have avoided 
Freiligrath, not wanting to have a disagreeable encounter with 
him; nor, at a crucial moment, could I relish the cowardly hedging 
(on account of his business connection with James Fazy, who is his 
principal). {But what I thought particularly unseemly was the way 
he continued to consort with Blind on an intimate footing, after I 
had shown him legal documents proving that Blind had, under 
incriminating circumstances, extracted from Wiehe, the com­
positor, a false deposition for publication in the Allgemeine Zeitung 
relative to the flysheet Zur Warnung.' 2'"} Nevertheless, in the 
eyes of the world we are 'friends' just as we have always been. But 
intercourse between our families has been completely broken off. 
As you know, my wife is of a determined disposition. 
I hope you will soon send better news of  yourself.

Dear Engels, 
THANKS FOR THE ARTICLE. 
I enclose herewith Eichhoff 's piece" which, however, you must 
return to me intact within 2 or 3 days at the outside. It doesn't 
belong to me. The scrawl had no sooner come out than it was 
confiscated in Berlin. This copy is the only one to be had in 
London. Part II, about Patzke, etc., so badly written, is excruciat­
ingly funny. Moreover, it shows you what those stinking courts of 
justice in Berlin are like. And the infamous press there, venting all 
of its liberal leonine courage on Bombalino and reserving none for 
its Patzke, its tribunals and its utterly contemptible Prince Regent. b 
Garibaldi is a veritable godsend. OTHERWISE, Bonaparte would 
have been restored to popularity and sustained by the Russo-
Prussian-Austrian Holy Alliance.2" 
Our gentle Heinrich Bürgers —but you'll see this for yourself 
from the enclosed epistle from Lassalle (also to be returned)—has 
gone over to the Prince Regent. Lassalle wrote to me first, from 
Aachen, where he is taking the waters for gout. Amongst other 
things, he says that in Cologne and Düsseldorf, where the 
Workers' Associations have been reorganised under the leadership 
of two young barristers unknown to us, r my anti-Vogt pieced  is 
eagerly awaited. Borkheim brought back the same news from

Switzerland. In reply to Lassalle's pressure, I told him a that all we 
can hope for (and such, judging by Siebel's letters, is the case) is to 
get the printing done in London, whence Petsch would transact 
business in Germany through the usual channels (Leipzig), and in 
other countries direct. To this end, I wrote, money is needed. Next 
I get the fellow's letter. But he won't get off so easily. I'm writing 
to him again today.b  He'll have to disgorge at least £30 by way of 
conscience-money. Borkheim is contributing £12. Thus, the major 
part of the expenses would already be met. Herewith a specimen 
proof from Hirschfeld. It would amount to £4 10/- a sheet. But 
there'd be as much on it as on two ordinary sheets. Take a look at 
the final pages of the conclusion to L.'s endless letter, where he

liver, if nothing else. The things about the Prussian government 
are quite interesting, but the best of it is that the chap imagines we 
should now concede that he is right over the Italian question!!! 
Now, when, in Italy  itself,  Cavour is actually being attacked and 
threatened by the revolutionary party! What naïveté. Now, with 
Garibaldi on the point of attacking Bonaparte in Rome," we are to 
admit that, in the spring of this year, we should have joined forces 
with Cavour and Bonap. and—qui sait? h—might yet join forces 
with them! True, Mr Weasel is very reticent about the present. 
You must at all costs avoid having your pamphlet' printed in 
London. I immediately wrote to Siebel once again. Firstly, the 
thing would be confiscated at once, perhaps actually on the 
frontier or at Leipzig, and secondly, even if this didn't happen, 
distribution would again be so appallingly bad that no one would 
ever set eyes on the thing. The experience is one we have been 
through hundreds of times with émigré literature. Always the 
same ineffectuality, always money and labour gone down the 
drain—not to mention the irritation. And then, where's the 
money to come from? According to your letter, it will call for £50 
to £60 or more, and Lassalle certainly won't get us £30. Come to 
that, the thing ought to be worded in such a way that it could be 
printed and distributed in Germany; of what use to us is a riposte 
to Vogt which no one ever sets eyes on? And I simply don't see 
why we need any confiscable content here. Even with the press 
regulations as they now are, you can still say enough to drive the 
Prussians mad, and that, after all, is preferable to satisfaction in 
partions'* of which the public remains unaware and which, as it 
were, you give yourself merely in private. 
Some three weeks ago I sent an article on the RIFLE MOVEMENT' to 
the Allgemeine Militär-Zeitung in Darmstadt and, because in my 
dealings, with those professional soldiers I couldn't risk sailing 
UNDER FALSE COLOURS, I told the fellows in an accompanying letter' 
that I had fought in the campaign in Baden on the side of the 
insurgents. 212 They did print the article all the same and it has 
now appeared in English over here as well.g If possible, I shall

connection of great value to me as regards military affairs. 213 
The business of the Holy Alliance3  is pretty disastrous and in 
France will be of enormous help to Bonap. Garibaldi, that's the 
only redeeming feature. Meanwhile, I'm anxious to know how the 
liberal philistines in Prussia will feel about her coming under 
Russia's aegis again. Nowhere else in the world, by the way, does 
the gutter-press equal that of Berlin; this time it even seems to 
have gone too far for the Weasel. I'll tell you this—it's impossible 
so much as to pick up the National- or the Volks-Zeitung; the 
stench of their boring balderdash and know-all fadaise 0 carries half 
a mile or more.

Dear Lassalle,

1. I wrote to Freiligrath (day before yesterday)42 about an 
answer to your question.2'4 None arrived.d Answering such 
questions conflicts, of course, with his duty to his office.

only possibility. By the by, deliberately written so as not to be 
confiscable. Although not printable in Berlin, it would, like any 
other book, be distributed in Germany from Leipzig; in Switzer­
land, Belgium, America direct from here. Engels is paying for one 
share, I for another. But the thing's expensive since a sheet costs 
4'/a pounds sterling over here. You must contribute a share if you 
can. I have optimistically arranged for printing to begin not later 
than next week. If the money has not been collected, nothing will 
be lost, save the sum to be paid for what has already been printed. 
3. Garibaldi shared my opinion of Bonaparte's mission, ' just as 
Mazzini did. I have actually seen letters of Garibaldi's on this 
score. However, the past is no longer of any concern. As soon as 
Garibaldi has divested the Italian cause of Bonaparte (and such is 
his object, expressly stated in a letter he wrote to an English 
acquaintance of mine, Green),1 ' all disputes within the revolutionary 
party will cease. But what is important now is that we should come 
to an agreement on a programme. If you would care to make a 
brouillon, 1 Engels, Wolff and I will agree possible modifications 
with you. The time is approaching when our 'small' if, in a certain 
sense, 'powerful party' (inasmuch as the others do not know what 
they want, or do not want what they know) must devise its plan of 
campaign. That we in particular (here in England) should adopt a 
national stance seems to me tactically correct—quite apart from 
any inherent justification. 
4. As for our attitude towards Russia, I think you are mistaken. 
The view that I and Engels have formed is a quite independent 
one, having, I may say, been laboriously evolved over many years 
from the study of Russian diplomacy. True, Russia is hated in 
Germany and, in the very first issue of the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung, we presented an anti-Russian war as the revolutionary 
mission of Germany. But hating and understanding are two 
altogether different things. 
5. Your praise of my book'1 gave me great pleasure, coming as it 
did from a competent judge. I think that Part II may very likely 
come out before Easter. It will take a somewhat different form, 
more popular TO SOME DEGREE. Not, of course, as a result of any 
impulse from within  myself,  but, first, because Part II has an 
expressly revolutionary function, and, second, because the condi­
tions I describe are more concrete.

In Russia my book has caused a considerable stir, and a 
professor in Moscow has given a lecture on it. 182 Moreover, many 
Russians, in particular, have written to me very kindly about it. 
Ditto German-speaking Frenchmen. 
6. Ad vocem 3 H. Bürgers?15  How like the gentle Heinrich. He 
was, it is true, nominally co-editor of the N. Rh. Z., but never 
wrote for it, except for one article,' 1 of which I deleted one half 
and rewrote the other. So enraged was he about this (it happened 
during the early days of the paper) that he asked for a general 
vote.  This I conceded as an exception, at the same time explaining 
that a newspaper office should be ruled dictatorially and not by 
general vote. Universal suffrage went universally against him. 
After that, he wrote nothing more. Prison, by the by, is said to 
have had a very moderating effect on him. Give me Casemate 
Wolff c any day. Admittedly, his temperament is diametrically the 
opposite of Bürgers'. 
What has vexed me more than Bürgers is that Miquel, a 
Göttingen lawyer and a very gifted and energetic member of our 
party, has joined Bennigsen.

written, but contains some delectable things. Throws a fine light 
on the liberal 'police' and the 'law-courts' in Berlin. Was instantly 
confiscated. One copy arrived here safely. 
8. I must confess my complete ignorance of Prussian legal 
procedure. I never imagined I should get material justice. But I did 
think the procedure was such that I would at least succeed in 
getting as far as a public hearing. That was all I wanted. 
Under (old) Rhenish procedure, did a private action for injuria 
or libel also depend on prior permission being obtained from 
officers of the judiciary, i.e. the government?

MARX  TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  25 September  1860 
Dear Engels, 
The family arrived back safely yesterday. 
With regard  to the  enclosed letter from Dana  I should explain 
that, after your visit  to London,217  I wrote  to Dana4" saying  I 
would rather  he  assigned  the  'NAVY' article  to some other 
contributor  to the  Cyclopaedia.218  After that,  I didn't hear from  him 
and thought  the  matter  had  been DROPPED until  the  enclosed letter 
turned  up yesterday.  If you  could possibly  do the  thing—however 
briefly  and  superficially  DOES  NOT  MAI PER—it  would  be of  enormous 
help to me,  particularly just  now,  since,  to obtain  a breathing-space, 
I was  forced  on 14  September  to draw  an anticipatory bill  on Dana, 
having  a life of 2  months (payable  2 months after date). When 
writing  to him, I  reminded  him of our  long-standing friendship,  as 
this was, in  fact, against  the  PRINCIPLES  of the  Tribune. However,  my 
letter crossed  his, so  just now it  behoves  us to  keep  him  happy, quite 
apart from  the  necessity  of his  continuing  to believe that  we can do 
everything. So,  if it is at all possible,  you  would oblige  me more than  I 
can say by  doing  the thing.  Ten  pages  was the  maximum prescribed 
by Dana. FIFE DO  ALSO,  a if not  otherwise feasible.  The  point  is that 
something should  go off. 
How  WITH  Lamoricière? h 
What  do you  think  of the  Garibaldi situation? 
Kossuth  was  balked  by Mazzini's intervention;  he had  been sent 
by Bonaparte. Garibaldi  was to  have by-passed Rome  and  marched 
on Venice direct.2'9 
Now,  ad vocem' Vogt. 
The thing's11 being printed here. 
1. Money.  All I  have  to pay is  £25.  £12  from Borkheim, Lassalle 
has promised  me £8.  There remains  £5. The  other printing costs, 
ditto distribution costs will  be met by  Petsch,  the publisher.  We are 
SHARERS TO EQUAL PARIS  in the  profits, after deduction  and  refund  of 
•' Five will also  do - b See  this volume,  p. 195. - ' as  regards  - d K. Marx, Herr Vogt.

the costs. I told Petsch this was now the only condition upon which 
I would have the thing published in London. 
2. The thing is not confiscable. This was a misapprehension on 
Lassalle's part. I had told him, on the contrary, that, though not 
confiscable, it could not appear in Berlin because no publisher 
there would print it because of the communist trial.44 
3. We are no longer in the 1850-58 era. Petsch has his agents in 
Leipzig, Berlin, and Hamburg. So, the thing will be distributed 
through ordinary booksellers' channels in Germany. In Belgium, 
Switzerland, and America, Petsch will sell direct through his agents 
there, thus saving a great deal of time. Advertisements in the 
newspapers, booksellers' notices, etc., will be attended to here, with 
my assistance. We shall send Siebel 50 copies to be distributed to 
journals, etc. Confiscation I hold to be out of  the question. Vogt is not 
the Prince Regent," and Stieber has officially fallen into disgrace. I 
am deliberately keeping myself en réserve where politics are 
concerned. 
4. We are saving time, for in Germany we might spend months 
yet doing the rounds; also time on proof-correcting, etc. It is 
Petsch's first publication (along with an anti-About pamphlet of 
Borkheim's1'), and he will go to no end of pains, if only in his own 
interests. 
5. If the thing goes well, as I have every reason to suppose, Petsch 
will publish pamphlets, whether by you or me, in German or English 
and put an end to BURKING by German publishers. (2 sheets already 
printed.) 
On this occasion, therefore, necessity would appear to have been 
a-virtue. Qu'en pensez-vous?^ I believe that Po and Rhine' 1 ditto 
Savoy,' etc., would have created much more of a stir had they 
come out here in London.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 1 October 1860 
Dear Moor, 
Where has your family been to, if they are now safely back 
home? b I'm completely in the dark. To the SEASIDE, perhaps, or to 
the country? I hope it has done them good. 
'NAVY' is most inconvenient just now.' I'm having the hell of a 
time with the LAWYERS over matters connected with the firm—no 
one in Germany has an inkling of the way things drag on here, 
and it's precisely this week that the fellows must needs descend on 
me with a mass of files, etc. However, I shall do my best220  but it 
certainly won't be a quick job, for I'm in no way au fait. 
Quanto ad  Vogt: I must say that I don't like your title at all. 1' If 
you want to give him a nickname, surely it must be one that is 
comprehensible to people without their having to read the book; 
alternatively it should only appear in the actual book after the 
explanatory bit. To my mind, the simpler and more unaffected 
the title the better, except that Bonaparte, or at least Plon-Plon, 
should, if possible, figure in it as well as Vogt. If you object to 
'Carl' Vogt, call him Herr Vogt, though I don't see why 'Carl' 
cannot appear above 'Karl'—no one is going to make a joke about 
it. 
Printing in London: I have no confidence in a publishing 
operation that requires us to advance all or half the money. The 
enclosed letter from Siebel shows that he was far from giving up 
a C Vogt, Studien zur gegenwärtigen Lage Kuropas. - h See this volume, pp. 195, 196,

the affair for lost, quite the contrary, and was only waiting for 
instructions in order to act (let me have it back, it hasn't been 
answered yet). I've seen only too often what happens when things 
are printed abroad, and I fear that it will be exactly the same this 
time.  If Vogt is an exception (and, after all, his thing was printed 
in Frankfurt^.), he was also backed up by the press, which certainly 
isn't going to happen to us. Besides, Mr Petsch is having to pay for 
the advertisements, etc., etc., and hence won't be particularly keen 
to advertise too much. Tu verras^ At all events, you would 
certainly have been able to find a publisher in Germany long ago, 
had you get Siebel moving properly, and I always prefer it this 
way b; furthermore, Hirschfeld's little press is not going to be in 
overmuch of a hurry. However, the thing is under way, and we 
shall have to see how it turns out. It would be best, I think, if, in 
addition to the title, you were to include nothing but the chapter 
headings in the advertisement; that would be quite sufficient. And, 
above all, see that the thing gets finished. 
When 3-4 sheets have been printed, you might send me copies. 
Apropos: What do 5 or 10 of Dana's pages amount to?' I've no 
idea. 
Lamoricière has been ignominiously surprised by the Piedmon­
tese. 2;!1 He was completely unprepared on that flank, his defences 
were directed exclusively against Garibaldi, and he had manned 
the worthless citadels in the towns with small garrisons fit only to 
deal with uprisings. Hence the succession of surrenders; overall, 
the Piedmontese were 6 to 1. At Castelfidardo the Austrians 
fought very well, likewise at Ancona, which is in no sense a 
fortress on the landward side; but, on the whole, the papal army 
shows how little can be achieved with a force which, though good 
in part, is heterogeneous and commanded by all kinds of foreign 
officers. Admittedly the Piedmontese were 3 to 1. 
From a military point of view, Garibaldi appears to be getting 
short of breath. He has dispersed his good troops among the 
Sicilian and Neapolitan battalions to such an extent that he no 
longer has any kind of organisation, and as soon as he reaches a 
moderately well defended river line with a fortress he does not 
command, as at Capua, he comes to a halt. Not that it matters 
much for the time being, since the 30,000 Neapolitans can't subsist 
on that small strip of land, and will have to disband in a fortnight 
11 You'll see. - b See this volume, p. 191. - c  Engels means the size of the article on the 
navy that Marx requested him to write (see this volume, p. 196).

or advance, which they won't succeed in doing. But, unless he has 
some really exceptional strokes of luck, it's hardly likely that G. 
will reach the Quirinal222  so quickly. On top of that, the 
Cavourians are now raising a hubbub; before long, these wretched 
bourgeois will be able to make his position untenable, so that as a 
pis aller' he'll be forced to attack before he's capable of winning. 
Apart from this, it would be essential to trounce the Neapolitans 
as quickly as possible and then induce the Piedmontese to 
fraternise before Victor Emmanuel joined them, for by then it 
would be too late, and they would stay loyal to Victor Em. But it is 
of the utmost significance that the French in Rome 223 should have 
been publicly placed by G. in the same category as the Austrians in 
Venice. Whether their expulsion will or will not be effected 
forthwith is of lesser significance. 
Things in Austria look splendid. A National Association21 
philistine, a Rhenish Prussian, who lives in Bavaria (Franconia), 
relates that people from Munich, who recently attended the 
railway festival in Vienna, never doubting the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung's reports about conditions in Austria, returned quite 
dumbfounded, so different had they found everything. The 
Austrians had told them that it was all humbug and that 
conditions there were no longer bearable. He also said that the 
bourgeoisie in Austria already had a specific for the financial 
imbroglio: in Austria 20% of all landed property belongs to the clergy, 
and this must be confiscated. Can one imagine a more splendid 
revolutionary situation? What is all that supercilious Prussian 
sophistry along with its National Association when compared with 
such a programme? 
The writings of Prince Frederick Charles 6 and Mr Waldersee' 
have convinced me beyond doubt that the Prussians have 
organised and trained their army so splendidly that they must 
inevitably be beaten. In order to remedy the defect arising from 
45 years' lack of war experience, they have created a mock 
conventional war in the shape of manoeuvres where everything is 
different from real war, and where soldiers and officers are 
expressly instructed to retreat on any pretext and where complete­
ly wrong notions and things are drummed into them. E.g., on 
manoeuvres soldiers are not, of course, permitted to enter and 
a last resort - b  [Friedrich Karl, Prinz,] Eine militärische Denkschrift, Frankfurt am

occupy houses; the houses, therefore, are marked as being 
occupied by posting soldiers round the outside. In Schleswig 
during a battle a Prussian captain received the order to occupy a 
farm, whereupon he posted his men round its perimeter fence, 
just as though on manoeuvres! Waldersee saw this with his own 
eyes.  Prince Fr.' Charles, by the way, is by no means a bad chap as 
soldiers go and absolutely detests the pointless grind of the 
Prussian parade ground. But, whether he's any good as a 
commander, it is impossible to say

MARX TO ENGELS

[London,] 2 October 1860 
Dear Engels, 
One of my letters must have failed to reach you, for I wrote and 
told you that my FAMILY was spending a week at the SEASIDE." 
As regards Dana's pages,'1 one of your large pages (e.g. in 
Artillery) was the equivalent of one of Dana's. 
My impression of Siebel's letter was exactly the opposite of 
yours, 1 namely his helplessness. Meissner, by reason of the 
Demokratische Studien, is actually in the enemy camp. Moreover, it 
would appear from his private conversation with Siebel that he 
expected a 'dignified' discussion and regards Vogt as a great man. 
O. Wigand is a personal enemy of mine and, years ago, on my 
offering to entrust him with the Eighteenth Brumaire (even for 
nothing), wrote me a churlish reply. 224 Oelbermann in Bonn is a 
mere fantasy. I know the meridian of Bonn. All in all, the 
pamphletd is pretty well unpublishable in Germany (especially as

Siebel has no connections with Leipzig publishers), judging by the 
style that has become established during the 10 years of reaction. 
And then to have the manuscript actually hawked round from one 
man to the next, thereby causing the whole thing to be blabbed 
out, without finding a taker—or only after protracted wanderings! 
I should, of course, prefer Cotta, Brockhaus or even Campe to Mr 
Petsch; but circumstances being what they are, I still regard him as 
a WINDFALL. Borkheim, who is a very good businessman, has great 
faith in Petsch. Finally, our last experiences in Germany were 
hardly encouraging. 
Printing will go ahead more quickly this week at Hirschfeld's. 
He still had all kinds of stuff that had to be finished.

Edwin James, the clown, was in such a FUNK that he fled all the way 
back to London, arriving the day before yesterday. 220 In the 
Plon-Plonist Opinion nationale Kossuth has addressed a letter to 
Garibaldi, which was written both in the spirit and at the behest of 
the Bonapartists. 
Your RIFLE articlea has gone the rounds of the London press226 
and has even been discussed in the pro-government Observer. This 
was a SENSATION.

[London,] 2 October 1860 
Dear Lassalle, 
Forwarded your letter to Freiligrath forthwith. 
When I wrote saying you should 'muster' a quota, I was, OF 
COURSE, deliberately using an ambiguous term. Only do not enlist 
the help of anyone who is not a personal friend of mine. I should 
be glad, by the by, to receive the contribution at an early date. 
Come to that, I don't believe it will be à fonds perdue for we shall at 
least recoup the cost of production. "* 
Engels wrote an essay on the English RIFLES c for the Darmstadt 
Militär-Zeitung, which he subsequently translated for the Manches­
ter Volunteer journal. It has been reproduced and discussed by the 
entire London Press. 226 
From letters that have come to me straight from Garibaldi's 
camp,  things would seem to be in rather parlous state. Cavour is 
actually Bonaparte's tool and controls Victor Emmanuel. Garibaldi 
is in a difficult position vis-à-vis Bonaparte and the Piedmontese 
army, the more so in that all the bourgeois and aristocratic 
riff-raff in Italy are on the side of Cavour. Somewhat to the

ENGELS TO MARX

Manchester, 5 October 1860 
Dear Moor, 
Enclosed £5 note E/L 33688 Manchester, 12 Jan. 60. 
I would have sent it sooner, but Gumpert touched me for ten 
pounds, after which I had to wait a day or two so as not to make 
myself conspicuous by drawing a lot of money all at once. 
As to printing in London, the chief consideration, of course, is 
that the thing' should appear and appear quickly; but printing in 
Germany was preferable and could undoubtedly have been 
arranged. However  SHARP  Petsch may be, a German publisher, e.g. 
Meissner (who is far from being the philistine you imagine him to 
soldiers -  >> of the pamphlet Herr Vogt - c K. Marx, Herr Vogt.

be—just take a look at his list) is in a much stronger position to 
break the conspiration du silence. Nor do I account it in any way a 
blessing that the party is thus also compelled to invest capital, for 
we've little enough as it is. 
Title—I would repeat, and this is quite definitely Lupus's 
opinion also, that at any rate, a title that requires one to read half 
the book before one finds out what it means could not be more 
unhappy. Your philistine has long since ceased to take such an 
interest in Vogt as to PUZZLE over why you should call him Dâ-Dâ. 
The only thing that can make Vogt interesting is his connection 
with Bonaparte and Plon-Plon, and this you must emphasise in the 
title,  if you are to arouse the philistine's curiosity. So far as the 
title is concerned, your system  OF MOCKERY  AND  CONTEMPT " is unlikely to 
produce anything but a title that is affected or contrived. A simple 
title is surely the best; MOCKERY  AND  CONTEMPT comes in the book soon 
enough. 
So, père 1' Garibaldi has drubbed the Neapolitans again after all, 
and taken 2,000 prisoners. 228 The impression the chap makes on 
the troops must be tremendous. It's an excellent thing that Tün-
should have been discredited along with Riistow's theory.' 
Otherwise, the latter would undoubtedly have taken it into his 
head to become the German Garibaldi; among the bourgeois 
republicans, the chap could come to be dangerous. It will probably 
be all up with Bombalino before long; the troops will soon have 
nothing left to eat and will disperse, for the area is not large 
enough to support them. Apart from that, there's nothing to be 
said about the affair for the time being. By the way, there's no 
denying that the rè galantuomo d is playing his hand with a great 
deal of PLUCK if he should now go to Naples. 
The success of my  RIFLE  article" was not altogether fortuitous. I 
sent the little sheet/ boldly marked in red, to the main London 
papers and the press up here and wrote to them more or less as 
follows: *The Correspondent, for England, of the Allgemeine 
Militär-Zeitung presents his compliments to the Editor of the ... 
and begs to call his attention to an article of his in the Volunteer 
Journal (a copy of which is sent by post) on the Newton review. As

Marie Antoinette with just a tiny soupçon of the virtuous Eugénie, 
but exceedingly  mannish,  notwithstanding—SHE  WILL WEAR  THE 
BREECHES.  His 'sensible creature' will surprise him yet. Madame la

dorf and is still said to frequent Kiipper's beer garden, where she 
puts away her 3 or 4 pints in an afternoon. Or so the philistines 
say. 
According to the latest reports, Garibaldi is the grandson or 
great-grandson of the Dr Jos. Bapt. Maria Garibaldi of Ajaccio 
who was sent to Germany by King Theodore  Neuhof,  married 
Miss Katharina von Neuhof in Westphalia and, after the over­
throw of his brother-in-law, settled in Nice. 229 His face certainly 
has a Westphalian cast to it. Ewerbeck and Willich are both 
caricatures of G. in their own way.

there is said to be a very pointed article against Vogt. c

Dear Lassalle, 
You will forgive  me for  writing  no more than  a few  lines. Apart 
from  my  usual preoccupations,  I am  just now  snowed under with 
proof-sheets." 
I should  be greatly obliged  if you  could  let me  have such money 
as you are  able  to send  by the  beginning  of November, since  I 
have given  the  printer  (as a  matter  of fact, printers  in London  are 
paid by the week)  an I.O.U. payable  at the  beginning  of November. 
Today  I received  a final nonsuit from  the  Supreme Tribunal.  It 
reads: 
'Your appeal  of August  23 of  this year against  the  ruling  on July  11 of  this year 
of the  Criminal Senate  of the  Royal High Court  in the  action  for  libel brought  by 
Dr. K. Marx against  Dr.  Zabel, editor  of the  N' ational-Zeitung,  is hereby dismissed 
as without foundation after consideration  of the  relevant documents.  For the  Royal 
High Court  did not  find  an  objective defamation  of the plaintiff  in the two  leading 
articles  of the  Nat. -Zeit,  in question,  nor did it  find that there  was  an"intention  to 
insult  the  plaintiff.  It was  right, therefore,  to refuse permission  to proceed with  the 
proposed action  for  libel. 
'The question whether there  is an  objective  act of  defamation,  or an  intention  to 
insult, essentially pertains  to matters  of fact and the  conclusions regarding them 
can only  be disputed  by an  appeal  to the  Royal Supreme Tribunal  if the  decision  of

entered into a written agreement with him whereby he has got to

Dear Engels, 
From your letter, I see that you are yourself in straitened 
circumstances.232 Nevertheless, not having anything pawnable left, 
I must ask you to send me the £5 you promised, and to do so, if 
possible, in the course of this week. Next Saturday (17 November), I 
have to pay Hirschfeld £25 against bills and haven't yet got 
together quite enough money. 
The book3 (12 sheets, 24 in terms of normal printed pages) will 
be ready next week. Because of the Supreme Tribunal's verdict,b I 
have had to completely rewrite the bit about the lawsuit,c  originally 
only a few pages long. It will now run to about 1 printed sheet. 
The whole of the last sheet in brevier (appendices). I haven't sent 
you the individual sheets because, in this case, as in any other, it 
would have detracted from the general EFFECT of the work. I shall 
send you 6 copies, 1 for you, 1 for Lupus, 1 for Gumpert, 1 for 
Borchardt, 1 for Heckscher, and 1 for Charley.' 1 
Your question concerning Lommel's pamphlet,1 " about which you 
had heard no more 'and which was where the money went' seems 
to imply some sort of reproach. D'abord, 1 even if it hasn't yielded 
a centime, I could not have written 'Agency', the most important 
chapter in the personal attack upon Vogt, without the help of 
Lommel. In reply to my various  CROSS-EXAMINATIO\S,  the man had to 
write at least 40 letters. Add to which, he let me have his anti-Vogt 
statement, originally intended for the Allgemeine Zeitung}™ I 
cannot see that people who are complete strangers to our party 
are under any obligation to work for us gratis. Besides, Petsch told 
me yesterday that he had sold 2 or 3 pounds' worth and would 
anyhow get rid of the rest—if not already sold out (he has just 
readvertised them in Germany) — in the UNITED STAFFS and Au­
stralia. 
As soon as you have read the book, you will abandon the view 
that it could have been placed in Germany (by 1880, maybe)

through the offices of Siebel whose connections are solely literary. 
I've heard from Siebel. 
I have given way to you over the title and (yesterday) inserted 
Herr Vogt. My wife was absolutely against this and intent on Dâ-Dâ 
Vogt, remarking most learnedly that, even in the case of Greek 
tragedy, the title and content would often seem at first glance to 
be unconnected. 
I don't know whether you have seen Kolatschek's Stimmen der 
Zeit. The article 'Juchheisten' (in which our friend Lassalle comes 
off badly) does in fact contain some information (although that 
jackass Kolatschek overlooks this), which sheds light on Vogt's 
reason for selling himself to Bonaparte. At the beginning of 1858 
a joint-stock company, 'La Cimentaire', a dubious type of loan 
bank, was founded in Geneva. Besides the managing director, who 
was never named, there was Vogt, co-director. By the end of 1858, 
the directors had consumed the entire capital. Bankruptcy. The 
MANAGING DIRECTOR was locked up. Criminal proceedings were to 
follow. From the National Council in Berne, Vogt rushed to 
Geneva. Fazy quashed the  case.  The shareholders did not get a single 
centime. 
From those same 'Juchheisten' (why, BY  THE  BY, does not 
Kolatschek, having sold himself to the Austrians, call them 
Juchheiten?) I see that Juchhe! nach Italien!* (for I could not bring 
myself to read the Vogt clique's Demokratische Studien, which 
Borkheim had put at my disposal), i.e. 'L. Bamberger', banker in 
Paris,  editor of the Mainzer Zeitung in 1848, disgusting cockroach, 
has presumed to speak of 'communists on half-pay'. b Hence I have 
written a short note about this wiseacre and have included him 
among Vogt's accomplices, and likewise introduced a few poor 
jests about the rest of the Juchheisten, L. Simon, Hartmann (the 
one who told Borkheim in Switzerland that Vogt had done me in), 
and H. B. Oppenheim.

MARX TO ENGELS 237 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 23 November 1860 
Dear Frederick, 
Best thanks for the £10 and the 'NAVY' 3 (splendid article). 
Now, as regards my wife's illness, it is in one respect better and 
in another worse than I was aware. For, until the character of the 
disease was definitely determined, Allen concealed its true nature 
from me. Yesterday this was no longer possible. What my wife has 
got is—SMALL  POX, and very badly, too, although she has been twice 
vaccinated against it. (Tell no one about it except Lupus.) And 
that's why Allen promptly removed the children from the house. 
It's a ghastly disease. Should Lenchen catch it, I shall at once 
send her to hospital. So far, I have done the nursing (the bulk of 
it) myself.  But, as I find it too exhausting, I hired a nurse as soon 
as the £10 arrived today. For many weeks my wife had been in an 
exceptionally nervous state owing to our many TROUBLES, and was 
thus more liable TO  CATCH  the contagion in an omnibus, shop, or 
the like. 
Writing articles is almost OUT OF THE QUESTION for me. The only 
occupation that helps me maintain the necessary  QUIETNESS  OF MIND 
is mathematics. During the past weeks I have written de omnibus 
rebus 1' for the Tribune, mainly on the  WARSAW  CONGRESS,  the  STATE  OF 
POLAND,  ITALY, FRANCE and the money market.238 Nothing about 
China yet. 
Have you had the Kolatschek?1 
The doctor has allowed my wife claret, taken in small doses, as 
she is exceptionally weak. Last night was dreadful—indeed, at the 
moment, I myself am  SICK  as well. 
The devil alone knows what misfortunes we suffer. 
I have boarded the poor children out witn the Liebknechts, who 
live quite close by and to whom I sent the VICTUALLERS daily. They

Sir, 
I should be greatly obliged if you would insert the declaration" 
overleaf in the Volks-Zeitung as soon as possible and let me have a 
copy  thereof. 
You will probably receive a copy of my anti-Vogt pamphlet'5 
next week. I am sending 3 copies to my friend Lassalle, 1 for 
himself,  1 for the Countess Hatzfeldt and 1 for Miss Ludmilla 
Assing. 
Would you be so kind as to apprise L. of this; also of the fact 
that for the past week my wife has been prostrated by a very grave 
nervous fever, so that, on doctor's orders, I was compelled to 
lodge the 3 children elsewhere. L. will realise that, in the 
circumstances, I cannot write letters, but he would greatly oblige 
me by writing  himself. 
I am, Sir, 
Your most obedient Servant,

Dear Frederick, 
My wife's condition has improved, in so far as this is possible 
under the circumstances. It is going to be a lengthy business. What 
might be called the paroxysm of the disease is now over. 
Allen believes that the only explanation for the infection is the 
state of extreme nervous excitation in which she has been these 
many months. 
Perhaps you would be kind enough to ask Heckscher to send 
the enclosed to the 'Reform' without delay. 
The day before yesterday, Petsch actually advertised Herr Vogt 
in the Hermann and the Athenaeum as due to appear this week." 
From its date you will see that I scribbled the piece for the 
Reform as long ago as Saturday. I had intended to send it to you 
with an accompanying letter, but suddenly felt so unwell that any 
kind of writing was OUT  OF QUESTION. Allen gave me some medicine, 
and today I feel all right again. Regards to Lupus. 
Your 
K. M.b 
Sir, 
Your acceptance of the following declaration would much oblige 
me. You will be receiving a copy of my anti-Vogt pamphlet in the 
course of next week.

To the Editorial Board of the Reform 
Declaration 
At the beginning of February 1860 the editorial board of the 
Reform were kind enough to publish a declaration by  myself c 
which began with these words: 
a The advertisement appeared in the Athenaeum on 24 November and in the 
Hermann on 1 December 1860. - b  Given below is the text of Marx's declaration 
published in the Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 336 (supplement), 1 December 
1860.  - c K. Marx, 'To the Editors of the Volks-Zeitung. Declaration'.

'I hereby make it known that I have taken steps preparatory to 
instituting legal proceedings for libel against the Berlin National-
Zeitung in connection with the leading articles in Nos. 37 and 41 
regarding Vogt's pamphlet Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine 
Zeitung. I reserve the right to answer Vogt in writing at a later 
date.' 
In the course of February 1860 I brought a libel suit in Berlin 
against F. Zabel, the responsible editor of the National-Zeitung. My 
lawyer, Legal Counsellor Weber, resolved at first on an official 
investigation. With a ruling of April 18, 1860 the Public Pros­
ecutor 3 refused to 'take action' against F. Zabel, on the grounds 
that there was 'no public interest' involved. On April 26, 1860 his 
refusal was confirmed by the Chief Public Prosecutor. 13 
My lawyer then began civil proceedings. The Royal Municipal 
Court in a ruling of June 8, 1860 prohibited me from proceeding 
with my lawsuit on the grounds that the genuinely defamatory 
'utterances and statements' of F. Zabel's were 'merely quotations 
from other persons', and that 'the intention to insult' was not 
present. The Royal Court of Appeal for its part declared in a ruling 
of July 11, 1860 that the alleged use of quotation did not affect the 
culpability of the articles, but that the defamatory passages 
contained in them did not refer to my 'person'. Furthermore, 'in 
the present case' the intention to insult 'could not be assumed'. 
Thus,  the Royal Court of Appeal confirmed the negative ruling of 
the Municipal Court. In a ruling of October 5, 1860, which I 
received on October 23 of this year, the Royal Supreme Tribunal 
found that 'in the present case' no 'legal error' on the part of the 
Royal Court of Appeal 'could be discerned'. The prohibition on 
suing F. Zabel was thus definitely sustained and my claim did not 
reach the stage of being accorded a public hearing. 
My reply to Vogt will appear in a few days.

MARX TO ENGELS 239 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 28 November 1860 
Dear Engels, 
My wife is now out of danger. Tell Lupus straight away, and give 
him my warm regards. The thing will drag on for a long time, and, 
as Allen says, when she is well again, she must go away at once for 
at least 4 weeks. 
As for myself—the danger of infection being greatest for 10 
days as from yesterday—I had myself revaccinated yesterday. Ditto 
Lenchen. A circumstance that has been of great help to me was 
having an appalling toothache. The day before yesterday, I had a 
tooth pulled out. While the fellow (Gabriel, he's called) did, in fact, 
pull out the root, after causing me great PHYSICAL  PAINS,  he left in a 
splinter. So, the whole of my face is sore and swollen, and my 
throat half closed up. This physical pressure contributes much to 
the disablement of thought and hence to one's powers of 
abstraction for, as Hegel says, pure thought or pure being or 
nothingness is one and the same thing. 
Well, during these ten days, the isolation will have to be more 
stringent than ever. 
I cannot write, of course, while in this state and, since the bill of 
£50 drawn on Dana 2 l/2 months ago" has in any case not been 
properly worked off—my wife had all manner of  NERVOUS  COMPLAINTS 
even before her illness, so that sundry matters were left undone 
and hence I'm in a great fix—I would ask you, at least during the 
next fortnight, to do as much writing as possible. Under the 
present circumstances it might seem to be appropriate to write to 
my old lady.b But ever since she allowed the Prussian corporalc  to 
marry into the family, all INTERCOURSE has ceased in consequence of 
certain remarks passed by me. There has been an appalling spate 
of dunning from all quarters. To alleviate it, in some quarters at 
any rate, I have handed out the greater part of the £10. I 
wouldn't write about all this to you, who already do all you can 
and more, but que faire? But what's to be done? Moreover, all

avenues are closed to me, for, strangely enough (due perhaps to 
the improvement), I cannot leave the house, since at the very time 
when I should be seeing as little of her as possible (which, of 
course, she can't be told), my wife wants me to be near her all the 
time. 
Allen is of the opinion that, if she hadn't been twice vaccinated, 
she would not have pulled through. As things are, he considers 
even the  SMALL  POX to be a blessing. For, so he told me yesterday, he 
thought her nervous condition was such that this ailment was 
preferable to a nervous fever or something of that kind, which 
might otherwise have afflicted her. 
The poor children are very scared. Allen is going to vaccinate 
them and the whole Liebknecht family on Friday. 
You will probably be getting Herr Vogt on Friday. 3 There was 
some delay last week, because / was unable to complete the 
revision of the final sheets on time. 
My best thanks for the wine. Even before it arrived, Allen had 
prescribed wine for me, along with another medicine of a less 
pleasant kind.

As a result of God alone knows what combination of cir­

while, at least, I am reduced to drawing only small amounts at a 
time;  the point is that where Ermen is concerned, it behoves me 
just now TO  APPEAR  TO LIVE  WITHIN  MY INCOME  (which I did not do during 
the last financial year); in view of the negotiations, this is an 
expedient that I simply cannot allow myself to be deprived of. If I 
could think up some pretext, I would try to borrow £5 for a 
fortnight from Gumpert, but I couldn't do so without his guessing 
what the reason was, and anyway I don't know whether he would 
have it at this season. I know very well what a fix you are in and 
shall do all I can — but the £10 I sent you recently has already 
been debited in advance to December's account, which means that 
that month is already heavily mortgaged. All the same, you'll get 
something tomorrow for sure. 
I was ready to do an article" for you this evening (last Fridayb 
my eye was so inflamed that writing by gas-light was out of the 
question), but Szemere—who sends you his regards—has just 
turned up, and so it's our  OF THE  QUESTION  today as well. I shall do all

Lupus has specially requested me to tell you in advance how 
much he enjoyed the dressing-down you gave Mr Simon. The 
more I read of the book," the better it pleases me. But shocking 
misprints and spelling mistakes. Once there's Russian instead of 
Austrian Emperor. Moreover, it looks bad when all the foreign 
words that your wife wrote in roman characters are printed in 
roman type. This invariably happens in the case of foreign 
printers and special precautions have to be taken to avoid it. 
What you have omitted are résumés. E.g. at the end of the 2 
chapters: 'Bristlers' and 'Brimstone Gang'; again, after 'Police 
Matters', after all the personal business (i.e. before the 'Studies'), 
and elsewhere, résumés would also have been appropriate, for in 
that way you would have presented your philistine ad oculos b with 
a general impression. It would have meant only four extra pages 
and would have been extremely effective in a book in which the 
material and the innumerable names—the latter pretty well 
unknown to the said philistine—tend to be somewhat overwhelm­
ing; it would also have brought out the artistry of the whole 
arrangement, which is truly admirable. 
How is your wife?

restless, can't sleep, and is even a little delirious, it's still very 
disturbing. 
How about letting me have another article by Saturday,3 about 
my lawsuit—perhaps, dated from Berlin? When I find writing 
LEADERS awkward, I date them from Berlin, Paris, etc. Such articles 
are easier to get through. 
Might not something be said about the Chinese war? Or 
Bonaparte's military preparations, etc.?241 
At the moment, I have absolutely no 'ideas' about anything. 
What I have got is an "orrible'b headache. 
The children—poor little devils—are still living in exile.c To 
cheer them up, I have sent them a bottle or two of wine. The day 
before yesterday, the little oned saw me walking past Liebknecht's 
house and shouted from the window: 'HALLOO, OLD BOY!' 
Apropos! As soon as Freiligrath heard of my wife's illness 
(didn't, of course, know what it was), he, of course, wrote me a 
letter full of 'feeling'. But when I sent him Herr Vogt —with, of 
course (you can see just how many ideas I have from the way 'of 
course' has cropped up 3 times in 3 lines), a friendly inscription, 
and he had occasion to write to me about SOMETHING ELSE,  he forgot 
to say a word about the book, or TO ACKNOWLEDGE its receipt. To 
suggest that he had forgotten to do so, he wrote at the bottom of 
his letter, 'In great haste'. I believe there are certain parts that 
worry him  stiff.  Firstly, his 'indiscretion' re Vogt. But Fazy, in 
particular. He was intending to move to Geneva in the spring. 
One wonders whether the disclosure of the Fazy scandal might not 
prove a hindrance. 
Blind, who had already ordered a copy from Petsch last 
Thursday," didn't get one until yesterday [Tuesday]. The thing 
wasn't distributed in London until then so as to prevent MR 
ALBERTS, OF THE PRUSSIAN EMBASSY, warning Berlin before my package 
of books arrived there. In London, of course, there have been a 
lot of jibes at my 'undignified' mode of attack. Twelve COPIES were 
ordered yesterday by that louse Trübner.

Dear Frederick, 
Best thanks for the £2. The OFFICE closest to me is the CAMDEN 
TOWN  MONEY OFFICE." 1 
As regards the want of résumés, you are perfectly right. They 
were there originally, but were deleted by me when I saw how 
much the affair had grown without my noticing it. For, printed in 
the normal way, the thing 15 would amount to a very stout volume. 
You will find, by the by, that in Chapter XI, 'A Lawsuit', all the 
personal stuff is so thoroughly dinned into your philistine that it 
will remain with him for the rest of his days. 
As for Monsieur Edouard Simon, the cur described you in his 
mud-slinging article 242 (a malicious translation of Techow's 'police 
spy') as 'le mouchard toujours affairé'.' Whereat I took it upon myself 
to make an example of the laddie, since insults aimed at you vex 
me more than those directed against  myself. 
Apropos—BY  THE  BY—as  soon as Lupus has got through the 
thing, I'd be grateful if he could drop me a line or two. My wife's 
greatest pleasure at the moment consists in letters about it. On the 
whole, she is getting on well, but slowly. 
Mr Philistine Freiligrath, that 'snotty Westphalian snout', d wrote 
to me yesterday as follows: 
'Your  book,' (not pamphlet, egad!) 'has been sent me by Petsch. Many thanks! 
From  what I have read so far, I find it is, as I expected, full of wit and malice. 
There  is so much detail as almost to make it difficult to get a general idea of it. 
You will excuse me if I do not enter into the case as such. Even today I still 
deplore  the whole dispute from which now, as before, I would sooner stand aloof.' 
What do you think of those two last sentences? The swine, who 
was already aware of Vogt's lies and Blind's turpitude, but now 
has them before him in black and white, is unwilling (not, mark 
you, that I invited him to do so) 'to enter into the case as such'. 
And 'now, as before,' he 'would sooner stand aloof from the whole

dispute'. It now seems to me that he hasn't yet read the whole of 
it, for he would then see just where he stands. I have now 
discovered the secret of his intimacy with Blind (it is business, of 
course, that ties him to Vogt-Fazy). Namely, on the occasion of the 
Schiller festival, Freiligrath had 20,000 copies of his poem a 
printed at a cost of £40-60. He wanted to make a business of it. 
But didn't sell forty. Since his speculation had failed, it now 
behoved him 'to palm off the cost, as Petsch aptly put it, onto the 
Schiller committee./5 In this Blind was his most servile TOOL. Hincb 
the 'reciprocal good turn' done by the snotty Westphalian snout. 
You will find the misprints you repiobate listed in the errata. 
Originally, the list was 3 times as long. But since it looked bad, we 
shortened it. The fault lies entirely with Hirschfeld, a ninny who 
has no control over his compositor. Petsch isn't having anything 
else printed by him. 
Salut. 
Your

Should something or other occur to you that might do for a 
military pamphlet of 1-3 sheets, Petsch would be delighted, for he 
now wants to achieve the status of 'publisher and bookseller'. He's 
a very nice chap.

my brother-in-law leaves tomorrow—so I've been in no position 
to do an article. Something on Austria" for Saturdayb if pos­
sible. 
As a person, Sz. is quite a decent chap; he has an Austrian's 
bonhomie and, at a time of revolution in Hungary, might even be 
energetic, resolute and clearsighted; but en dehors de son pays' he 
certainly has little in the way of knowledge or ideas. At any rate, I 
couldn't extract a great deal of sense from him in this respect. It's 
odd that, having adopted such a decidedly Bonapartist stance in 
his pamphlet, 11 he should now have performed a complete 
volte-face. He made me, inter alia, the following conciliatory 
proposal: What, he inquired, would my attitude be if, given the 
disintegration of the Empire, the Habsburgs were to remain 
merely Kings of Hungary, and German Austria revert to 
Germany?e  Whereupon I told him, of course, that such a solution 
might be perfectly acceptable to us and that we would gladly make 
the Hungarians a present of the whole robber band. His 
negotiations regarding the wine business here went off quite well. 
Cobden's recommendations and the acquaintances he struck 
up chez Cobden in Paris have made things much easier for 
him. 
If at all possible, I shall send you another two pounds 
tomorrow; unfortunately it's too late today. 
Regards to your wife, who is getting better, I hope, and the 
girls.

Apropos port! I've none left that's drinkable, but shall try and 
lay my hands on some decent stuff tomorrow and send it off

MARX TO ENGELS

[London,] 18 December 1860 
Dear Frederick, 
My wife is now much better. Allen thinks that the children  — 
running two households is not only very inconvenient, but also 
expensive—will be able to come back on Sunday" or Monday. I 
myself shall then resume my contributions to the Tribune, which 
has had only 2 articles 'M3 in nearly 5 weeks. Let me have another 
one by Saturday if you can. 
For the past two days, I have been confined to bed and taking 
medicine, but Allen says it is nothing of any consequence and I 
should be fit again in 3 or 4 days. Apparently, it's the result of the 
EXCITEMENT, etC. 
As regards your view of Szemere, I would inform you, strictly on 
the quiet, that I am entirely of the same mind. The really funny 
part is that I had proposed to him, ironically, that they should 
keep the Habsburgs for themselves, that Pest would be the final 
place of refuge for the same, etc.1'

Dear Moor, 
Enclosed the £2 on Camden Town. 
The more I read of the book,a  the more difficult I find it to 
imagine how Vogt will pass off these stories that 'will never come 
out'. b 41 copies in London in a few days is a great deal; by now it 
will be even more. This is, of course, the best polemical work you 
have ever written; it's simpler in style than the Bonaparte' and yet 
just as effective where this is called for.

THANKS for the £2. I have sent Lenchen to the POST OFUCK to 
collect it. 
My wife, or so Allen thinks, will not have any pock marks. She

recovering that sick people grow more restive and impatient), but 
Allen is perfectly satisfied with her PROGRESS.

As for  myself,  I am today (the worst thing was lack of sleep) 
much the better for having slept soundly all night and hope to be 
ALRIGHT again in 2, or, at the most, 3, days' time. 
Having been too unwell to go out this week, I don't know how 
the book3  has been selling in London. Though I've been told by 
Liebknecht that the London Workers' Society 3 has bought 6 copies 
for its library this week. 
Zimmermann of Spandau (now a lawyer in London), formerly a 
member of parliament, bosom friend of Vogt, once a great 
traducer of the Volk and of my own person, last week gave a 
dinner at which the lawyer Höchster (connu 1' from Elberfeld, now 
a very busy avocat in Paris) was present; our friend Rheinländer 
also attended. Zimmermann declared that Blind was hopelessly 
compromised. As  TO Vogt, he [Zimmermann] had been reluctant to 
credit bribery, although aware of the chap's vanity and frivolity. 
But now my work had convinced him that Vogt was nothing but 
an ordinary 'mouchard'' only distinguished from muchardus vulgar-
isd by the size of his salary, etc. Moreover, he (Z.) had written to 
acquaintances in Switzerland in order to leave Mr Vogt in no 
doubt about his views. 
Bücher has written and told Borkheim that the case against 
Vogt has been fully proved. Also that my work had eradicated any 
'prejudice he might have had against Marx's agitational activities'. 
He had, he wrote, expressed his views on these two points in the 
Camberwell e businessmen's circle (to which he gives lectures on 
the history of German jurisprudence) and written ditto to 
'influential persons in Germany'. 
Zimmermann and Bücher are of importance here because of the 
philistines. 
In the course of my ordeal—during the past 4 weeks—I have 
read all manner of things. Inter alia Darwin's book on Natural 
Selection} Although developed in the crude English fashion, this is 
the book which, in the field of natural history, provides the basis 
for our views. By comparison, A. Bastian's Der Mensch in der 
Geschichte (3 stout volumes; the chap's a young Bremen doctor 
who has spent several years travelling round the world), with its 
attempt to present psychology in terms of 'natural science' and 
history in terms of psychology, is bad, muddled, and amorphous.

The only useful thing in it is a few ethnographical ODDITIES now 
and again. And, what is more, very pretentious and atrociously 
written. 
Apropos. As regards Ludwig Simon, try and guess how I 
succeeded in catching out the gentle Kunigunde. a 
Lassalle, from whom I got a letter a few weeks ago, is very ill. 
Not gout—osteitis? Is publishing, or so he writes, 'a long and 
important work' with Brockhaus in 2 volumes, b 17 hours in bed, 3 
hours up, and busy proof-correcting this 'long and important 
work'. I can hardly suppose the anti-Vogt piece, which I sent him, 
will serve to alleviate his aches and pains. But whose fault is it that 
he's a Berlin 'idealist politician'?

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 26 December 1860 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Herewith a cutting of the advertisement for Herr Vogt from the 
Genfer  Grenzpost*;  the enormous  LETTERS  are themselves indicative of 
the love Brass feels for Vogt. By the by, in the last 5 numbers of 
the Grenzpost there are some very good articles. 
Up till now, or so Petsch told me yesterday, 80 copies have been 
disposed of in London. On the other hand, he complains, 'not a 
single one'h in Manchester. 
Otherwise, to the best of my knowledge, nothing has appeared 
so far in the German press except in the Reform, which has 
mentioned the thing (favourably) several times1  and has promised 
a long article next week. So far as the Allgemeine Augsburger 
Zeitung is concerned, it's all rather odd. They have been sent 
2 lengthy reviews, one by that shit Biscamp, the other by 
Mr L. Bucher for the supplement. And still not a word.  BUT  nous 
verrons? 
Well now: 
1. L. Simon." The book was almost finished, up to the last page, 
when, late one evening, being on my way to Hirschfeld's about 
some proof-correcting, I called in for a moment at friend 
Rheinländer's OFFICE in the City. With an exceedingly cheerful

countenance, he told me that young Höchster (the lawyer's son) 
had come over from Paris and gone into business here in London. 
Rheinländer knows the Höchsters, father and son, very well from 
his Paris days. Young Höchster —I saw him later at R.'s—is an 
innocuous lad quite without political—I wouldn't say views—but 
.ideas.  He was once clerk to a banker— Königswärter a or some 
such (at the moment I'm not quite sure whether I've got this 
well-known Bonapartist name right), where L. Simon was CHIEF 
clerc. R. asked Höchster about the gentle Kunigunde. 'Oh,' says he, 
'he's not popular at the office. Although  CHIEF  of the clercs,  he's so 
unsure of himself that he refers everything to the PRINCIPAL, and 
he's got very little idea of business. He's bad-tempered, and then a 
lot of his time is taken up with politics. The famous E. About 
comes to see him nearly every evening, and they work together. I 
have myself seen them correcting the proofs of one of their joint 
publications.' On CROSS-EXAMINATION by R., it then transpired that this 
joint work was La Prusse en I860!' In Königswärter's Bonapartist 
office, L. Simon was RATHER boastful about his connection with 
E. About, and young Höchster, being like a newborn babe in 
politics, believed he was telling R., against whom, of course, he 
does not harbour the least suspicion, something that was 
altogether to L. S.'s credit. What is particularly odd is that later, at 
the dinner given by Zimmermann (to which Höchster JUNIOR was 
not invited) R. very artlessly asked old Höchster what he thought 
of my denunciation of L. S. Höchster aîné 1 declared that for many 
years past, he had on principle stayed away from politics which 
had already been his undoing twice. All the same, he said, he 
found the thing hard to credit; but R. insisted that my source was 
a very 'reliable' one. 
2. Blind has avenged himself in the grand manner. He has 
notified Petsch et Co. that he will no longer favour them with his 
custom. Such is 'the blind man's revenge'. Old Zizka! 
3. About Freiligrath—who will today derive comfort from the 
plaster you applied to his "snotty snout—and the material basis of 
his relations with Blind, I have, if I am not mistaken, already 
written to you.d What actually happened was this: 
At the time of the Schiller festival (1859), the noble poet, through 
his agent  Blind,  first offered the famous cantatae to the manage­
ment at the Crystal Palace.24'1 They were to pay him £40  DOWN  IN CASH 
for permission to publish the renowned cantata and, on  the day of the

Schiller festival, they were to sell it in the Crystal  Palace,  other sales 
being reserved by the mercantile poet for  himself.  The management 
thanked Mr F. profusely for his kindness and begged him to peddle 
his cantata  himself. 
Thereupon the noble chap, ostensibly at his own expense, got 
Hirschfeld to print 20,000 copies of the tripe. The cost of 
production was £40. The noble poet's plan was that half the 
profits should go to the Schiller Institute '" and the other half to 
his propriis laribus,3 which, after deduction of production costs (his 
retail price was 6d per copy), would have meant that he would 
CLEAR  £210 for  himself,  and, on top of that, gain kudos in Germany 
for his magnanimity. 
But he had counted his chickens before they were hatched. 
Perhaps a few hundred COPIES  <ALL  IN ALL) were sold throughout the 
whole of England, and these were disposed of only by bringing 
the utmost pressure to bear on private individuals. 
So now he found himself in trouble.b Then Blind worried away 
at the Schiller Committee from morn till night and from night till 
morn in an endeavour to induce them to bear the printing costs, 
in which, after fierce altercations, he finally succeeded. Hinc illae 
lacrimae.c 
The disposal of the many COPIES left in stock was entrusted by 
Freiligrath to his blind friend, and last November (1860) this 
indefatigable little sharper engineered his own Schiller festival in 
London, so as to get rid of F.'s rubbish. No wonder, then, that F. 
is now, as before, 'on intimate terms' with his precious Blind.'1  F. 
knows better than anyone else on which side his bread is buttered, 
avant touf when it comes to SHOP INTEREST (including, or COURSE, 
literary fame). 
Whilst on this subject, I should mention another DROLLERY 
characteristic of Blind. 
On the quiet, without a word to friend Freiligrath or friend 
Kinkel (and drawing on the famous £100 fund), the pensive Blind 
had had printed something preliminary, or a preliminary some­
thing on Schiller and Blum. f At half past seven in the morning, 
he, ere others dreamt of evil, placed outside the entrance to the 
Palace24t> a boxful of his 'radical pamphlets' guarded by mes­
senger-boys borrowed from the Morning Advertiser who pressed 
a own hearth - b In the original, 'Holland in Not' (Holland in trouble)—a phrase, 
dating back to the Netherlands' war of liberation against Spanish oppression 
(1572-1609). - c Hence these tears (Terence, Andria, I, 1, 99). - d See this volume,

the rubbish into  the  hand  of each arrival. Anyone  who  asked what 
it cost  was  relieved,  according  to his  outward  APPEARANCE,  of 6d, 3d, 
or as  little  as Id.  Anyone  who  didn't  ask got the  rubbish  for 
nothing.  And  thus, even before Kinkel's speech"  of F.'s  cantata1'

Of the 6  COPIES  of Herr Vogt you ordered, will you kindly send 
one to the Kölner Anzeiger, one to the Zeitung für Norddeutschland

that you yourself should read through a copy and yourself do a 
notice of it. 
As for the Kölner Anzeiger, you might use this little sheet as a 
weapon against the Kölnische Zeitung. 
Sales of the book are going so well that Petsch is 'contemplating' 
a second edition. In such an event, it would be of the utmost 
importance that you should, if possible, supply me with everything 
that appears about it in Germany (I see nothing here but the 
Allgemeine Zeitung, the Neue Preussische Zeitung, and the Volks-

Dear Moor, 
The Revelations* will be despatched from here today or

people know where it is to be had. 
Can't you get me Toby's cry of pain2''8? 
Shall write to Siebel. 
In none of the German papers save the Kölnische' 3 have I found 
so much as an advertisement—which is surely odd. 
Our old enemies are not escaping the fate they deserve. The 
editor en chef of the late lamented Strassburger Correspondent was, 
according to the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung,^ "a certain Mr 
Wolfers of Cologne"—the worthy Wolfers of Dumont's paper' 1— 
couldn't you somehow convey this to Biscamp for transmission to 
the Augsburg A. Z.? Also, that the chap is not a Rhinelander but 
a beastly Belgian. Schwanbeck dead of delirium tremens, the 
worthy Brüggemann disappeared and consigned to oblivion, and 
Wolfers openly in the pay of Bonaparte—what more can you ask? 
Doubtless King William I will now make a real ass of himself as 
well. When he tells the Berliners that much has happened that was 
unjust, e perhaps he is referring to the enforced dismissal of 
Stieber.250  Apropos. Another friend, griffin  Greif 1 would appear

will be getting too much for Mr Bonaparte as well as for Franzi. 
In North America things are also hotting up. With the slaves the 
situation must be pretty awful if the SOUTHERNERS are playing such a 
risky game.203 The least irruption of irregulars from the North 
might result in a general conflagration. At all events, one way or 
another, slavery would appear to be rapidly nearing its end and 
hence also COTTON PRODUCTION. What repercussions this will have on 
England we shall soon see. And with such powerful movements 
under way, a jackass like Bonaparte thinks he can go on fishing in 
troubled waters indefinitely.

Dear Frederick, 
I myself only had Toby's cry of pain248 for rapid perusal. Last 
week, by the way, I ordered 2  COPIES  through Petsch, one of which 
you shall have. 
Siebel's present address is Carl Siebel jun., Barmen (Kleine 
Wertherstrasse, No. 25). 
Petsch has already advertised the Revelations'1  in the Buchhändler-

consideration for Schapper.

As regards booksellers' advertisements of Herr Vogt, I have so 
far seen them only in the Reform," the Publicist^ the Freischütz,' and 
the Grenzpost. A Incidentally, I got Petsch to write, under my 
supervision, to all the chaps concerned, and thus the mystère will 
resolve itself within the next few days. He thinks it doesn't depend 
on the newspapers but on the  booksellers,  who have been putting 
the thing off until after Christmas and the New Year. And the 
advertisement goes into the newspapers only through the agency 
of the bookseller who is responsible for local sales. Mais nous 
verrons! e 
You can see what a hapless creature I am! Last Wednesday/ 
(JUST  A WEEK  AGO) I got a cold and cough accompanied by a stabbing 
pain in the region of the liver, so that not only coughing, but 
turning my carcass from one side to the other, caused me physical 
PAINS.  This seemed to me to indicate an inflammation. It was the 
first time I had felt a dolorg of this kind, although Allen had often 
asked me searchingly whether I had. This time—particularly since 
I am already encumbered with a hair-raising DOCTORS BILL, not to 
mention other  BILLS,—  I have so  FAR been treating  myself.  The 
treatment was simple—no smoking, CASTOR OIL, drink only 
lemonade, eat little, no spirits whatever, do nothing, stay at home 
(since the cold air at once sets me coughing). I'm not quite well yet 
and somewhat weak. By the by, you might sometime ask Gumpert 
what one ought to do about such acute attacks, should they recur. 
I shall ask Allen as soon as I can go out again and am once more 
completely fit. 
Salut.

Dear Engels, 
Yesterday I received the enclosed scrap of paper and thus can 
no longer avoid paying the agents £2 5/- for the books. 254 In 
addition, the  TRANSPORT  thereof to my house will cost  ABOUT  10/-. Duty 
has been waived. I'd certainly not write to you about this nasty 
matter, but dura nécessitas* since I haven't a farthing. 
Overleaf you will find a copy of a scrawl penned by H. Beta at 
Gottfried Kinkel's behest on the subject of Herr Vogt.

Magazin  für  Literatur  des  Auslands.  1861. No. 2. 
'Herr Vogt —by Karl Marx.  In the early years  of the  "refugees", many  a little 
sum was  doubtless expended  on getting secret police  to smell  out  frightful secrets 
and conspiracies. While  the  labour  was  great,  the  yield  was  rather pitiful.  But as 
regards  the  fear inspired  in many  a refugee  by the  secret police,  it was  indeed quite 
desperate. Some  men  actually went  mad as a  result. Others,  it is  true, liked  to boast 
about this fear,  and to let all and  sundry know that almost every state  in Europe 
had assigned special spies  to them. Boasting  it was, not  hypochondria.  The  devil  in 
person eluded  the  notice  of these small  fry,  even when  he had  them  by the  scruff 
of the  neck. They  ate and  drank with  him,  entertained  him as a  friend  at their 
tea-tables,  and  never noticed that  his  only object  was to  betray them,—not  for 30 
pieces  of silver,  not he! He was  prepared  to pay, and pay a lot, for the  printing  of 
this pamphlet with  his own  money.  For ten  years  now the  said Mr  Karl Marx would 
seem  to have laboured  and  snooped  and  nabbed letters  and  copied them  so that he 
might appear  on his own  account  and for his own  delectation  as the  first among  all 
your Vidocqs  and  Stiebers.  All the long-forgotten rubbish  and  mistakes perpetrated 
by the  emigration  ten  years since have been made  use of,  copied, extracted from 
friends over  a cup of  tea—not that  one  would wish  to pillory  the  latter.  In the 
space  of ten  years,  any man,  whether  a refugee  or not, is  liable  to write something 
nonsensical  or over-hasty  in private, counting  on the  discretion  of friends,  on its 
being swept away  in the  flow  of time.  But  when friends carefully glean these 
occasional slips  and  snippets  and  deck them  out  with whimsy, thus raising  a cloud 
of dust  and  filth,  as in Mr  Marx's pamphlets, when,  for example, things uttered  in an 
agitated hour  ten  years since h — (voilà Godofredum)'—are printed  in bold  so that 
one sees  Mr  Marx's desire  to make  a ribaldry,  a disgusting little anecdote  out of 
11 hard necessity  - h Marx's italics.  - l That's Gottfried (Marx's remark).

them,—then indeed everyone deserves to be pilloried. Mr Marx is a master of 
constructive denunciation. Vidocq, Ohm, Stieber, etc., are mere lambs by 
comparison. Many will delight in wading through this churned-up filth, for it is 
masterly calumnya; but we would urge caution on our readers: in the simian 
wilderness there are malicious baboons who, for want of other weapons, resort to 
ordure with which they bombard friend and foe alike. Beware: Throughout almost 
the whole of his 190 pages Mr Marx engages in this type of strategy, a type which 
eschews all expenditure on ammunition. Read it, by all means, but keep close at 
hand a basin of water and strong soap, not forgetting your smelling bottle!

Dear Lassalle, 
D'abord^ my best if belated wishes for a Happy New Year. 
My wife is now convalescing. Her illness resulted in my falling 
seriously ill  myself;  and, at present, I am suffering from 
inflammation of the liver. And a very nice New Year's gift too! 
Hitherto, the complaint has merely been chronic. Now it is 
becoming acute. 
This is the explanation for my silence, despite the very close 
sympathy felt both by my wife and myself for your sufferings. I 
hope that when you next write you'll have a better account to give 
me of  yourself.  If you would care to send me a fairly detailed 
report on your illness, I shall consult a doctor whom I regard as a 
veritable aesculapian genius." However, he does not live here, but 
in Manchester.

I was  greatly tickled  by the  Royal Prussian Amnesty2'0  which  in 
effect excludes  all refugees from  its indulgence. Gottfried Kinkel, 
who has  recently joined  the  National Association, 2'7 could, 
however, return,  if a  correct interpretation were  put on the 'act of 
grace'.  As for  Bucher, Freiligrath, Borkheim, Zimmermann  of 
Spandau,  and many others, they have long been 'naturalised 
Englishmen'. 
Faucher, former London correspondent  of the  Neue Preussische 
Zeitung, afterwards co-editor  of the (MANCHESTER SCHOOL"'")  Morning 
Star,—  a chap,  by the by,  with whom anyone  can  consort since  he 
does not  conceal  but,  indeed, openly flaunts,  a lack  of character 
typical  of the  Berliners,  and who  isn't actually taken politically  au 
sérieux''  by any of his  acquaintances,—believes that  he can now 
play the  Prussian Cobden. Good luck  to him.  Such,  at least,  was 
his plan when  he left London. 
One of my  friends,  f. Ph.  Becker,  is at  present with Garibaldi  in 
Caprera.  He has  written, telling  me  that  the  Mazzinists were 
almost exclusively responsible  for the  serious part  of the  south 
Italian movement, that Garibaldi does  not  exactly possess  a 
superfluity  of brains,  and  that  the  utmost confusion reigns  in his 
friends' camp. Garibaldi,  by the by,  agrees with Mazzini  in 
believing that Cavour isn't even well-intentioned with regard  to 
Victor Emmanuel, that  he is  rather Bonaparte's direct tool  and 
that the  Gaeta intervention,"'9  as well  as Farina's appointment  to 
Sicily  and  Farini's  to Naples,  etc., are  nothing  but  carefully 
calculated moves  to compel  Vic. Em. to  make fresh territorial 
concessions  to France,  and  concessions  in favour  of Murat  in 
southern Italy. Which will succeed,  and  soon become manifest. 
The slavery crisis  in the  United States will bring about  a terrible 
crisis  in England  in a  year  or two;  the  Manchester  COTTON  LORDS  are 
already beginning  to tremble. 
I seldom read German  stuff.  Recently, however,  I happened 
upon  A. Bastian,  Der  Mensch  in der Geschichte,  etc. I think  it's a bad 
book, formless  and  pretentious.  His  endeavour  to explain psychol­
ogy in terms  of 'natural science' amounts  to little more than  a 
pious wish.  His  endeavour  to  explain history  in  terms  of 
'psychology',  on the  other hand, shows that  the man  does  not  know 
what psychology  is, or, for  that matter, history.

struggle. One does, of course, have to put up with the clumsy 
English style of argument. Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, 
for the first time, 'teleology' in natural science is not only dealt a 
mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained. 
I have lately had the opportunity of seeing rather more German 
newspapers. Ghastly  stuff.  And, withal, a self-satisfied mediocrity 
which is indeed NAUSEOUS. 
Could you send me the 2nd volume of Eichhoff's Polizei-

Dear Frederick, 
You must excuse my failure to acknowledge receipt of the £3 
ere now. On Monday I had a relapse and, since there was no sign 
of improvement on Tuesday, I had to have recourse to Allen 
again, so that I am at present UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT. Writing 
means that I have to stoop, which hurts, and so I kept putting it 
off. As you see, I am as tormented as Job, though not as 
god-fearing.

Siebel —whose time appears to be very valuable since there 
hasn't been a single line from him—has sent me 2 Cologne 
Anzeigers, containing two short reviews favourable to my book. 3 The 
bookseller's advertisement was in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung 
supplement of 1 January. 
I'd be glad if you would let me have for The Times a short 
critique in English of the Prussian amnestyb2S6—because of Allen's 
orders that I should refrain altogether from writing for at least 
another week. The following are the main points to be emphasised: 
1. That the amnesty is the lousiest to have been proclaimed in 
any country (not excluding Austria) since 1849; (mesquin^ typically 
Prussian); 
2. That the state of the 'liberal' Prussian press may be judged by 
the plaudits it bestows upon this piece of ordure; 
3. That, whenever a new government comes to power in Prussia, 
an amnesty is proclaimed in respect of certain minor mis­
demeanours, resistance to gendarmes, insults to officials, etc., and 
that the present amnesty is in fact no more than this. 
4. In effect all refugees—i.e. all who took part in the revolution 
of 1848/49—are excluded from the amnesty. The prospect held 
out to those refugees 'liable to be sentenced by Our civil courts' and 
who are permitted 'to return without let or hindrance' (as though 
everyone had not always been 'legally' entitled to return), is that 
the Ministry of Justice will 'ex officio' lodge 'pleas for clemency' 
on their  behalf.  This, in effect, guarantees nothing. This 
absurd formula was chosen presumably because Prussia is a 
'state under the rule of law' whose constitution precludes the king 
from suppressing any judicial inquiry. A pretty mockery in a state 
where, on the admission of the Prussian Gerichtszeitung (in Berlin), 
there has been no justice for the past ten years. Furthermore, 
sentences in absentia could be  AT ONCE  pronounced and quashed. 
This 'legal' coquetry is indeed deserving of recognition when 
Stieber,  Greif,  and Goldheim continue to be left at large—ditto 
Simons, Manteuffel, etc. 
5. Beastliest of all is § 4 of the amnesty, whereby 'all those liable 
to be sentenced by military tribunals in the near future' must first 
'appeal' for William's 'clemency', whereupon he 'will reserve his 
final decision until such time as he has received a report from Our 
Military Department of Justice'. 
a Herr Vagi - h See this volume, pp. 249 and 253. - c mean 

=====第285页=====
148. Marx to Engels. 22 January 1861 249 
Consider in this connection that, given the Prussian Land-
wehr's41 constitution, it is most exceptional for a Prussian refugee 
to be outside the jurisdiction of a 'military tribunal'; that the 'plea 
for clemency' is categorically prescribed, and nothing positive is 
promised in return for this humiliating procedure; finally that, 
more than any refugee, William himself is in need of an 'amnesty' 
since, from a strictly legal standpoint, he had no business to 
intervene in Baden,21'0 etc. 
The Times will undoubtedly accept a critique of this kind with 
the utmost pleasure. I would send it simultaneously to other 
papers as well, just signing it, of course, 'A PRUSSIAN REFUGEE'. At the 
same time, I would write a personal letter to the Editor.3 
It is the only way we can give these Prussian dogs, and the 
corporal1' in charge of them, their deserts.

As to my condition, Allen is of the same view as Gumpert. But, 
whatever it may be, it is a highly disgusting condition, which 
incapacitates one for work. There is also some attendant physical 
pain, though today it's much better. I'm still taking medicine and 
Allen calls every three days. He was here again today. Riding, 
CHANGE OF AIR, etc. But I can't, of course, tell him where the shoe 
pinches. I have wondered off and on whether I might not fix 
something up with a  LOAN  SOCIETY  through Borkheim so as to put my 
affairs in some sort of order, these having become much 
disorganised as a result of medical expenses, the impossibility of 
drawing on the Tribune, etc. But each time I get to the point, my 
heart sinks into my boots, for Borkheim (despite all his GOOD 
QUALITIES) is a braggart and every day—or rather each time I see 
him—he goes on about the money he is owed by refugees. 
If you could send me an article whenever you have the time and 
the inclination [it would]a be very welcome. I am still INCAPABLE. 
Most welcome of all would be an article from you for Saturday13 
on French armaments,0 or on things French generally. 
In my view there is no alliance between Russia on the one hand 
and Prussia and Austria on the other. It's simply that Russia, who 
always protects herself on two sides, has concluded certain 
agreements (relating to Poland and the Danubian Principalities) 
with the chaps in Warsaw262; but it's also quite certain that she has 
struck a new bargain with Bonaparte against other 'contingen­
cies'. 
Apropos: It might, perhaps, be even better if you wrote about 
Schleswig-Holstein. d One point: the foul behaviour of the Berlin 
press,  which constantly abuses Austria for 'impeding' Prussia's 
anti-Danish moves. Now that Austria has given its consent, it wails 
about 'snares', issues warnings, urges peace, etc. Vide Volks-Zeitung, 
Kölnische Zeitung, etc. See that you lay about the Berlin press. In 
the past I used to do so frequently in the Tribune. But it has to be 
constantly repeated.

reply to all your inquiries. First, my thanks for your package. I have 
passed one COPY of the petition to Freiligrath. Engels will receive

Perhaps you would be good enough to see that the enclosed 
note is delivered to Mr Eichhoff without delay. 264 
Owing to the current state of your health, friendly duty 
precludes my spurring you on to fresh labours. OTHERWISE I would 
have declared an anti-Zabel pamphlet, such as you envisage, to be 
a political deed. 
My wife sends her kindest regards to you and the countess.3 Her 
convalescence is proceeding satisfactorily. I, for my part, expect I

[London,] 29 January 1861 
Dear Engels, 
When misfortunes come, they never come singly, as you will see 
from the enclosed letter from Dana. They have protested a bill for 
£30 I drew on them at 2 months' date on 10 December and, 
furthermore, have cancelled all articles for the next 6 weeks. 
Yesterday I went straight to Freiligrath, of course, and, if he is to 
have adequate security, about the only way out is for him to try 
and discount a bill which I shall give him on myself at 3 months. 
How I shall continue to make  SHIFT  here I can't imagine, for the 
rates,  school, house,  GROCER,  butcher and God knows what else are 
denying me any further  RESPITE.  What a dirty trick it was of Dana's 
to refer in his statement of accounts to the critical period of 
1858/59 when my contributions were reduced to 1 article per week 
purely as an exception*" an agreement that was in any case 
rendered null and void years ago per usum'' and, what's more, 
explicitly by letter. Now he is deducting all the articles they didn't 
print last year. Conversely, allowing his incorrect assumption that 
the agreement of 1858/59 remains in force, he would still not have 
the right to condemn me to IV2 months' idleness. And yet there's 
no action I can take against the chaps, since I'm entirely 
dependent on them. I really don't know what to do, though I have 
long seen this crisis looming up. 
Lassalle's letter also enclosed. In his present missive, he shows 
no sign of remembering the impression Vogt's rubbish2 " had 
made on him. Still, it is better to see the light late rather than not 
at all. As to his proposed revival of the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung —la Hatzfeldt, about whom I enclose a memorandum 2" 
for you, has 300,000 talers at her disposal  — I would, circumstances 
being what they are, clutch even at this straw, but the tide in 
Germany hasn't risen high enough yet to bear our ship. The thing 
would prove abortive from the very outset. 
Toby1' has again written to Borkheim, inquiring whether it was 
true that he had never heard about our £90 refugee affair. I was 
iw.< despised in Germany, he said, hence the universal silence. Even

the great L. Walesrode has declared that no one need reply to 
such scurrilities, etc. En passant, I should be grateful if you would 
send Borkheim —seeing that he contributed £12 to Herr Vogt —a 
reply to his letter. It is a point upon which he is very touchy. 
Bücher and Rodbertus, who had been on the list of deputies for 
Berlin, were struck off by infuriated Little Germans 266 following 
the publication of their statement.26 ' The latter is bad, but the way 
Bücher serves G. K. (Gottfried Kinkel) in the last issue of the 
Hermann* is good. 
Mr Kolatschek wrote yesterday asking for a complimentary copy 
of Herr Vogt in order to review it. This has been sent. There have 
been relatively large sales of the pamphlet in Petersburg and Riga; 
on the other hand, nothing (maybe 6 copies) in Cologne. 
The story Lassalle tells about Zabel is a good one.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester, 31 January 1861] 
Dear Marx, 
It's difficult to answer Borkheim's letter.3  All local commission 
houses which buy  GOODS  • for the Italian market operate there 
themselves. Hence they would regard an order from London as the 
action of a competitor and duly ignore it. Reuss, Kling & Co. and 
A. S. Sichel are the main houses in this line, but they certainly 
won't accept small orders. At all events, make sure that whoever 
approaches these people does not mention my name; it would 
serve no purpose whatever and might make me look a complete 
ass. If the order is of any size and the intention is to start a 
regular connection, the buyer would do best to come up himself 
and go to the manufacturers direct. The people here who buy for 
the London houses are exclusively in the EAST INDIA TRADE or else 
small chaps whom I don't know. 
That's all I have to tell you today. 
I can't imagine what fellows he is referring to who are up to all 
kinds of nonsense.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 2 February 1861 
Dear Frederick, 
Yesterday I got the enclosed note from Freiligrath3 which 
doesn't make matters any more agreeable. You must write and tell 
me at once what I ought to do. 
In fact, I've been so  BOTHERED  from all sides that my head is going 
round and round and, on top of that, there is the unpleasantness 
of having to annoy you with all my petites misères. 
I have written to Dana, who is definitely in the WRONG  legally,  but 
with little prospect of success.b The fellows know that one needs 
them and that they, for their part, don't need one at this moment. 
Weren't you going to send me the Nazione—certain letters of 
Mazzini's? Forgotten? You will shortly be getting the confiscated 
issue of the Courrier du Dimanche from me. 
Bucher maintains—he asked Borkheim to tell me—that his 
review will still appear in the Allgemeine Zeitung. You will doubtless 
have seen that at every opportunity the scoundrelly Blind brings 
his name before the public as an homme d'état.' 
The rotten book business has cost me more than £4 all in all. 
What a strange fate this LIBRARY has!244 
No news from Siebel? His connections certainly seem to be 
exceedingly limited. 
Salut. Your

Thimm told Petsch a day or two ago that Herr Vogt has been the 
object of some particularly malicious abuse in Manchester. Brass, 
expressly for his own personal satisfaction, has ordered new type 
to be cast so that Herr Vogt can be advertised in an even more 
conspicuous manner. Given the large number of Swiss in 
Manchester, is it not possible to sell at least 1  COPY  of the Grenzpost 
there?

Dear Moor, 
I can't manage more than a line or two today. Provided the 
tailor is prepared to discount the bill for £35 if I draw it and so 
arrange it that the money doesn't have to be paid until July or 
August, VERY WELL, I shall draw it. But I must be able to count on 
the utmost discretion, for it could cost me my position. If 
Gumpert has got some money in (I haven't seen him since Friday), 
I might even be able to arrange it without that. a

Dear Moor, 
You can write and tell Freiligrath that we don't need his tailor. 
Gumpert has obtained so much money in payment of his accounts 
that he can lend me the greater part of what is needed, to be 
repaid monthly £5  AT  A TIME;  the business has therefore been fixed 
up. Freiligrath can have the £30 any day and then he need only 
pay the expenses, which I shall likewise remit to him within 24 
hours of my knowing the amount. As far as I'm concerned, he can

write to me about it direct and you need not bother about this 
whole thing any more. I shall then make sure that I get at least 
part of the amount put down to the next financial year. 
Your letters returned herewith. Not until my last had gone 
off, 2'2 did I discover that, according to Dana's calculations, you 
have drawn payment for 19 more articles than they printed. 
Nevertheless, the fact remains that it is a dirty rotten business and, 
in this respect, the Tribune is behaving in true PENNY PAPER fashion. 
Its socialism amounts to nothing more than the highly contempti­
ble petty bourgeois mania for getting the best out of a bargain. 
Lassalle has become Isidor P-B a again. What sort of politician is 
this who thinks he has reduced a government to pulp because he 
has demonstrated that it was guilty of inconsistency in so trifling a 
matter? He must have some fine notions of parliamentary rule 
and what stands for law and justice under that rule. The man is 
incorrigible. One can only wonder what his monumental work in 
two volumes1' will be about. At all events, anything can happen 
now that he has made such a complete volte-face in re Vogt.2a As 
to his little paper,' if I were you, I would advise him to start a 
weekly in opposition to the  Preussisch.es  Wochenblatt, Berliner Revue, 
Wochenschau des Nationalvereins ,'' etc. La Hatzfeldt's 300,000 talers, 
which both of them will hang on to very tightly indeed, and 
madame's Lucullan mode of life won't leave enough in the way of 
an income to keep a daily going. There'd soon be a dearth of cash. 
On the other hand, a weekly of this description doesn't cost much 
and it would certainly be a nice source of income for us. Lassalle 
would, of course, have to pay us properly, i.e., English rates, 
otherwise it's no go. Besides, the thing would come in very useful 
as a mouthpiece for us. 
Our Prussian corporalc is suffering from a truly colossal attack 
of the shits. In every speech, the oaf talks of the impending 
life-and-death struggles. 
The Volunteer Journal has published a revised version of my 
Tribune article on French armaments.2'* This evening I shall, if 
possible send off a dozen copies to all the newspapers; the thing 
may create a sensation. I am also sending you one; since the 
scoundrels in New York are not at all interested in it now, 
and in any case it has been much shuffled about, no harm can be

Dear Freiligrath, 
I have so arranged matters with Engels that you can obtain the £30 
any day you like, ditto the expenses at 24 hours' notice. The tailleur d 
thus becomes redundant, and I would ask you to let Engels know 
when he is to send the money. 1' 
I shall myself be obliged to go to Holland, since I won't 
otherwise be able to weather the current crisis. Would you be so 
good as to inquire from some business friend of yours what the 
position is in regard to passports in Holland—whether one has to 
have a passport? The Tribune's 'turpitude',c coinciding as it did 
with other misfortunes, was all the more disastrous for me in that 
it prevented me from making futher arrangements about my 
wife's convalescence in accordance with doctor's orders. Although 
I don't belong to the category of 'German martyrs' and have 
always been inimical to that category, I nevertheless think I have 
had my fair share of refugee-trouble.

Dear Mother, 
I am returning herewith the contracts, 7 copies, duly signed, 
having kept the 8th here.270 I must say that, if it hadn't been for 
your sake, I could have made up my mind to do so only with 
difficulty. It was hard for me thus to exclude myself for no valid 
reason or on no good pretext, or so it seemed to me, from the 
only family business that remains to us—remains with any 
certainty. I believe that I also had a right to it and that my 
brothers b had no right to assume that I should, without more ado 
and for no reason at all, relinquish that right in their favour. What 
I demanded was certainly not unfair; moreover, I had put 
forward that demand quite early enough for it to be taken into 
account during the deliberations. Emil Blank conceded as much 
when he was here. But I was told absolutely nothing more, and

not till the others had settled everything did they approach me 
with the demand that I agree to forgo my claim, basing that 
demand—in EmilV letter—on reasons which may be very 
businesslike, but which J, for one, would not have cared to bring 
up in this way vis-à-vis my brothers; and, by way of consolation, / 
am left with Emil's assurance that Gottfr. Ermen, or so Emil is 
convinced, will not break his contract with me. This conviction is 
outweighed by that of our lawyer, who told Emil more than once 
that the contract qua contract affords me no legal guarantees. They 
have the business in Engelskirchen, and I have Emil's conviction. 
Mother dear, I have swallowed all this and much more for your 
sake.  Not for anything in the world would I contribute in the 
smallest way towards embittering the evening of your life with 
family disputes over inheritance. I believe that my conduct when I 
was at home,141' just like my letters, has amply demonstrated that I 
was very far from seeking to place obstacles in the way of any 
agreement and that, on the contrary, I gladly made sacrifices so 
that everything might be settled in accordance with your wishes. 
That is why I have signed the thing without more ado. Whatever 
the cost, I would not wish you to be plagued with such things any 
longer, or to worry about them. Nor shall I bear any grudge 
against my brothers, or so much as mention the matter to them, 
unless they absolutely force me to do so, for it has been settled, 
and I have no desire to parade my belief that I have made a 
sacrifice. But I considered it my bounden duty to tell you frankly 
what my motives were in this matter, and it goes without saying 
that I never remotely supposed you could, perhaps, have arranged 
matters more favourably for me. On the contrary, I know that, 
throughout the negotiations I, too, was always in your thoughts 
and that you did all you could for me. 
The matter is now settled, and that is that. You are unlikely ever 
to hear another word from me about it, and I need not say that, 
when Emil comes over here, I shall, as always, give him a fraternal 
welcome; though our views may have differed in this case, he is, 
nevertheless, a fine lad, who has always taken my interests over 
here very much to heart. 
The dressing-gown has arrived, and I am very glad of it as it's 
freezing again, but the red epaulettes are a trifle outré for local 
taste.  By the way, I now have the company of a young ratter, who 
has strayed into the house.

[London,] 14 February 1861 Dear Frederick, 
You must really forgive me for not having answered your very 
kind letter1' before now. In the meantime, you will have received a 
communication from philistine Freiligrath. 
I have had, and still have, an enormous amount of running 
about to do. For I intend to go to Holland so as to put my affairs 
over here in order, otherwise they will get out of hand. There are 
two things I require for the purpose, a passport and money, both 
of which I shall manage to get hold of here d'une manière on d'une 
autre. 1 (I may have to go as far as Aachen.) 
I haven't written to Lassalle yet. No doubt something in the 
nature of a weekly d would be best, but, then again, what a risk we 
should run, given the indiscretion of our friend, if he were there 
on the spot as editor-in-chief, and thus in a position to get us all 
into hot water! He would, of course, immediately stress that the 
thing was a party organ, so that we, too, should be held 
responsible for every imbecility and our position in Germany would 
be ruined before we had so much as regained it. This requires the 
most careful consideration.

The conspiration de silence in the German press is having a 
seriously adverse effect on sales of Herr Vogt. After a good start, 
they have accordingly come to a STANDSTILL. The Allgemeine Zeitung 
seems pretty well determined not to carry Bucher's review either. 
At any rate, we shall know one way or another in the next few 
days,  for, if it intends to publish it at all, it can't go on putting it 
off much longer. Kolatschek is a certainty. 
My wife recommends that you read Hans Ibeles by Johanna 
Mockel/' in which Willich figures as Wildemann, etc., Mrs von 
Brüningk as Platonina, and that blackguard Kinkel as Don Juan. I 
myself know nothing about the rubbish save for what my wife has 
told me. She says that the book provides irrefutable evidence that 
Johanna Mockel threw herself out of the window because she had 
been crossed in love.  (BY  THE  BY, my wife's complexion is still far 
from smooth and probably won't be for some time to come.) At 
any rate, it's commendable in Parson Kinkel 2'1 that he should 
make money out of the late Mockel's  CONFESSIONS  by selling them to 
Cotta, and then consume it with Minna Werner, by whom he already 
has a child. Parsons are the cleverest of men. However, Johanna 
Mockel was an acrimonious body and her breath, for all her love of 
music, was acrid, too. 
Have had the Nazione.h Very good. Ditto the Volunteer Journal. 
But not your pamphlet.269 
Vogt will never forgive Vincke for having put him in the shade 
so completely. Incidentally, those Prussian swine are making fools 
of themselves IN  EVERY  RESPECT. Firstly, the blackguards ask Bonaparte 
to continue his intervention at Gaeta 272; secondly, the rascals have 
joined Bonaparte and Russia in declaring themselves in favour of 
continued French intervention in Syria.273 Austria opposes this, 
and, of course, so does Palmerston, FOR APPEARANCES SAKE. And the 
way they're carrying on at home! The rotten bunch is bound to 
come a cropper. 
Wilhelm Liebknecht has been almost completely laid off by his 
American newspapers as well. One of the papers' for which he 
wrote was SACKED in New Orleans.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN BERLIN 
[London,] 15 February 1861 
Dear Lassalle, 
I did not, as I had intended, send off a second letter to you 
on the heels of my first," because, in the meantime, a crisis had 
supervened, i.e., a financial crisis. Dana wrote from New York, 
saying that it (the Tribune) had dismissed all its European 
correspondents, retaining nobody save  myself,  but that 1. the 
Cyclopaedia? 1 was to be temporarily suspended; 2. my contributions 
were to be suspended for 6 weeks; 3. finally, that in future I was 
to write one article less per week. 
Under these circumstances and in view of the expenditure 
arising out of my wife's illness, I have got to go to Holland and see 
my uncle Philips, if I am to put my financial affairs in some sort 
of order. Since I require money for the trip I have drawn a bill on 
you for £20 (ABOUT 34 talers) payable at 6 weeks' sight. I shall send 
you the required sum from Holland before the expiry date or else 
bring it to Berlin in person, for I may possibly come as far. I shall 
come, by the by, simply as a traveller if, that is, I cross the Dutch 
border and enter Germany. (If I were Karl Heinzen — Heineke 
the lusty knave 274 — I should say OVERSTRIDE.)

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 27 February 1861 
Dear Engels, 
I am leaving tomorrow on a passport made out not to me, 
however, but to Biihring,* valid for Holland. This created a vast 
amount of TROUBLE, as did raising enough money for me to get 
away at all. Have paid quite small sums on account to the most 
pressing creditors; in the case of others (e.g. GROCER), I invoked the 
American crisis and obtained a respite, but only on condition that 
my wife paid weekly during my absence. In addition, she has to 
pay £2 18/- in rates next week. 
Nota bene. I presume you got a letter from my wife (ABOUT a 
week ago) in which she thanked you for the wine? She is a little 
worried lest it should have fallen into the wrong hands. The 
children, too, are greatly obliged to you for the wine. They would 
seem to have inherited their father's fondness for the bottle. 
I shall probably go to Berlin as well—without a passport—to 
look into the matter of a weekly3 (Apropos—in Berlin William I is 
called Handsome William), and survey the dungheap generally. 
In the last number of the Hermann, that swine Blind published a 
letter Mazzini had written him.b  The importunate slimy creature 
clearly succeeded in convincing Mazzini that he represents the 
German émigrés. He uses the said Hermann as a receptacle for his 
filthy twaddle—patriotic—on the subject of Schleswig-Holstein, 
and also makes the latter an occasion for writing letters under his 
own name to the -Globe, etc. Through Bronner—with him and 
Schaible he constitutes the 'Association for Freedom and 
Unity' 276—he extorted so much money from a Bradford merchant 
that he was able to start a rotten little rag in Hamburg—the 
Nordstern —so as to throw his weight about in the North, while in 
* Biihring—formerly represented the Faucher proletariat, his  FREE-TRADE  pro­
letarians—has real inventive genius, but is not a business man, hence invariably 
swindled while others exploit his inventions.

the South, through Schaible's agency,  he courts notoriety  as 'Blind, 
man of iron'  in the  columns  of the  Stuttgart Beobachter  (a kind  of 
South German Volkszeitung).  The  purpose  of all  this business  on 
the part  of the  wretched creature  is, on the one  hand,  to shout 
down  the  disgrace inflicted  on him in  Herr Vogt 3 and, on the 
other,  to become Hecker secundus.  Le pauvre  hère!" 
The Cologne people have done  my  library proud.244  The  whole 
of Fourier stolen, ditto Goethe, ditto Herder, ditto Voltaire  and, 
what  to me is  ghastliest  of all, the  Economistes  du 18 siècle 
(brand-new, cost  me  some  500 fr.) and  many volumes  of classical 
Greek writers, many single volumes  of other works.  If I go to 
Cologne,  I'll  have something  to say  about  it to  that National 
Association  man  Bürgers. Hegel's Phenomenology  and  Logic ditto. 
During  the  past fortnight there's been such  a lot of  confounded 
running around  to do—real ingenuity  was  needed  to prevent  a 
complete break-up  of the  household—that  I have read  no 
newspapers whatsoever,  not  even  the  Tribune  on the AMERICAN 
CRISIS.  However,  for  recreation  in the  evenings  I have been reading 
Appian's Civil Wars  of Rome  in the  original Greek.'  A most 
valuable book.  The  fellow comes  of Egyptian stock. Schlosser says 
he is 'soulless', probably because  he probes  the  material basis  of 
the said civil wars. Spartacus emerges  as the  most capital fellow  in 
the whole history  of antiquity.  A great general  (no  Garibaldi  he), 
of noble character,  a REAL  REPRESENTATIVE of the  proletariat  of ancient 
times.  Pompey  a real shit; acquired spurious fame only  by 
misappropriating,  as Sulla's  YOUNC  MAN-,  etc.,  Lucullus's victories 
(over Mithridates), then Sertorius's (Spain),  etc. As a  general,  was 
the Roman Odilon Barrot.  As soon  as he was  brought face  to face 
with Caesar  and had to  show what stuff  he was  made of—a mere 
louse. Caesar perpetrated  the  most stupendous military blunders, 
deliberately crazy ones,  to discountenance  the  philistine opposing 
him. Any  ordinary Roman general—Crassus, say—would have 
annihilated  him six  times over during  the  battle  in Epirus.27'  But 
anything could  be  done with Pompey.  In Love's Labour's Lost, 
Shakespeare would seem  to have  had  some inkling  of what Pompey 
was really like.'1

Dear Mother, 
I would have liked to answer your dear letter straight away, but 
with Emil's" being here, have been so taken up with current 
business that it has been quite impossible. Well, he left yesterday 
morning and will probably reach Engelskirchen tonight. Dear 
mother, you have no need to worry about the possibility of my 
bearing any grudge against my brothers' 5 over the matter of the 
firm; it wouldn't occur to me. It was extremely disagreeable for 
me to have to withdraw from the family business in this way, nor 
could I find it agreeable when something I looked upon as a right 
to which I was entitled was lightly passed over for all kinds of 
reasons that had no bearing whatever on that right, my assent 
being, so to speak, demanded as a matter of course.c I do not 
suggest that things haven't been arranged as well as, if not better 
than, they might have been had my claim been taken into 
consideration, but this is precisely what no one has taken the 
trouble to explain to me, and you cannot deny that, in the 
circumstances, it was expecting rather much of me to sign the 
thing. But having done so, I regard it as settled and you can count 
on me not to bear any of my brothers the slightest grudge about 
that. We shall need one another often enough and, besides, you 
know that I'm not in the least inclined to play the noble soul of 
whom no one takes note. I am sure Emil didn't notice any

ill-temper on my part, still less any manifestation of annoyance 
towards  himself,  nor indeed could he have done, since I have now 
resigned myself to the thing and my only wish is that the business 
in Engelskirchen should yield good results for the four of us. 
So, do not grieve over it, mother dear. For  myself,  the thing is 
over and done with, so much so that even the painful sensation I 
undeniably experienced, when I signed it, is likewise over and 
done with, disposed of and forgotten. If, I thought, this one 
aspect of the thing is disagreeable to me, then how many more 
such moments—far more disagreeable ones—must you have gone 
through in the course of the negotiations? And then I rejoiced at 
being able to put a stop to it all with one stroke of the pen. I 
might acquire a hundred other businesses, but never a second 
mother. 
I am very well, by the way. Emil enjoyed himself here very 
much, and will have written to tell you that we have just about 
finished with Gottfr.,a so that that affair, too, will at last be in 
order. Well, goodbye, and mind you keep fit and look after 
yourself properly. My warmest regards to Hermann,b the Rudolfs,' 
the Blanks, and the Boellings. 
With much love, 
Your son

possibility of joint politico-literary enterprises, but also and more 
especially to see you again. 
Now, however, I should like you to tell me exactly how matters 
stand as regards the following point. The only passport I have is 
an old one issued by the French when I was expelled in 1849.279  I 
could not bring myself to approach the Prussian Embassy in 
London. Nor did I wish to become a naturalised Englishman (like 
Freiligrath, Bucher, Zimmermann, etc.) and travel on an English 
passport. The following question arises: In 1845, when pursued in 
Belgium by the Prussian. government, 28" I obtained through my 
brother-in-lawa a Prussian expatriation permit. On the pretext of 
my having ceased to be a Prussian subject, I was, as you know, 
expelled by the Prussian government in 1849. However, in the 
eyes of the law, all refugees who had spent 10 years outside the 
country would equally have ceased to be Prussian 'subjects'. I have 
never been naturalised abroad. Further, in accordance with the 
resolution passed by the Preliminary Parliament281 of 1848—a 
resolution that was regarded as virtually binding by all German 
governments on the occasion of the elections to the Frankfurt 
parliament22 —all refugees, even though, like Vogt, etc., they 
might have been naturalised abroad, could avail themselves of 
their German citizenship and everywhere qualify for election to 
parliament. I invoked this when, in 1848, I requested that my 
Prussian citizenship be reinstated. This was refused by the 
Prussian ministry of the day, though they didn't venture to treat 
me as a foreigner until ail was up with the revolution. 
ïn practice, the only importance that attaches to this question 
just now is vhether I shall be able to get to Berlin unimpeded. If 
only I car, succeed in crossing the border, I shall have nothing to 
fear in Berlin; on the periphery, however, it's a more ticklish 
matter. 
As you know, I am here with my uncle1 ' (who looks after my 
mother's affairs and has, in the past, frequently made me 
substantial advances against my share of the inheritance) in order 
to put my parlous finances in order. He's a stubborn man, but the 
fact of nry being a writer greatly appeals to his vanity. So, when 
you write to me, you must refer to the success (lucus a non lucendo c) 
•' Wilhelm Robert Schmalhausen - h Lion Philips - ' Literally: 'a grove from not 
being light'. The expression, first used by Quintilian in De institutione oratoriu (I, 6, 
34), illustrates the practice ascribed to ancient Roman etymologists of deriving words 
from their semantic opposites, as hints ('grove') from Ulcere ('to shine, be light'), 
because a grove is not light.

(Address: Dr F. Lassalle) 
My dear Cousin, 
I cannot thank you enough for your precious letter which fails 
only in being too short, although you have acted up to the English 
rule of packing the best things in the smallest compass. 
I arrived at Berlin on Sunday last (17th Marchd ), at 7 o'clock in 
the morning. My travel was not marked by any incident save a 6 V2 
hours'  delay at Oberhausen, an abominably tedious little place.

streets of Berlin, had everything prepared for my reception, and 
gave me a most friendly welcome. The first hours having been 
talked away and my railway-fatigue chased by some rest and some 
refreshments, Lassalle introduced me at once to the house of the 
countess of Hatzfeldt who, as I soon became aware, dines every 
day in his house at 4 o'clock p. m., and passes her evenings with 
him. I found her hair as 'blond' and her eyes as blue as formerly, 
but for the remainder of her face I read the words imprinted in 
it: twenty and twenty make fifty seven. There were in fact wrinkles 
full of 'vestiges of creation', there were cheeks and chin betraying 
an embonpoint which, like coal beds, wants much time to be 
formed, and so forth. As to her eyebrows, I was at once struck by 
the circumstance that they had improved instead of deteriorating, 
so that art had by far got the better of nature. On later occasions I 
made the general remarks that she perfectly understands the art 
of making herself up and of finding in her toilette-box the tints no 
longer derived from her blood. Upon the whole, she reminded me 
of some Greek statues which still boast a fine bust but whose 
heads have been cruelly 'beknappered' by the vicissitudes of time. 
Still, to be not unjust, she is a very distinguished lady, no 
blue-stocking, of great natural intellect, much vivacity, deeply 
interested in the revolutionary movement, and of an aristocratic 
laissez aller very superior to the pedantic grimaces of professional 
femmes d'esprit. 3 
On Monday, my friend Lassalle drew up for me a petition to the 
chief of the Prussian police for my restoration to the civil rights of 
a Prussian subject. b On Tuesday, Lassalle  himself,  who is a man of 
extraordinary audacity, carried the petition to Herr von Zedlitz 
(Polizeipräsident, partisan of the Junkerpartei and the king's" 
confidant) and, what with menaces, what with flatteries—Zedlitz 
considering this direct appeal to  himself,  instead of to the 
subaltern authorities, as a compliment paid to his person—he has 
so far succeeded that to-day the ministerial paper—Die Preussische 
Zeitung —announces my return to the 'fatherland'. Still I have not 
yet received an official answer in regard to my re-naturalisation. 
On Tuesday evening Lassalle and the countess led me to a 
Berlin theatre where a Berlin comedy, full of Prussian  self-
glorification, was enacted.' 1 It was altogether a disgusting affair. On 
Wednesday evening I was forced by them to assist at the 
performance of a ballet in the Opernhouse. We had a box for

ourselves at the side—horribile dictw'—of the king's 'loge'. Such 
a ballet is characteristic of Berlin. It forms not, as at Paris, or at 
London, an entrejeu, h or the conclusion, of an opera, but it absorbs 
the whole evening, is divided into several acts, etc. Not a syllable is 
spoken by the actors, but everything is hinted at by mimickry. It is 
in fact deadly—dull. The scenery, however, was beautiful; you 
assisted for instance at a sea-voyage from Livorno to Naples; sea, 
mountains, seacoast, towns, etc., everything being represented with 
photographical truth. 
On Thursday Lassalle gave a dinner in honour of my return, 
gentlemen and ladies being invited. Among the celebrities there 
were the old general von Pfuel, 'Schlachtenmahler" Bleibtreu, 
Hofrath Förster (a known Prussian historiograph and formerly 
called the 'Hofdemagog',' 1 he being a personal friend of the late 
king') and so forth. Hofrath Förster brought out a toast on my 
humble  self.  I was seated at table between the countess and 
Fräulein Ludmilla Assing, the niece of Varnhagen von Ense and 
the editor of Varnhagen's correspondence with Humboldt. 1 This 
Fräulein, who really swamped me with her benevolence, is the 
most ugly creature I ever saw in my life, a nastily Jewish 
physiognomy, a sharply protruding thin nose, eternally smiling 
and grinning, always speaking poetical prose, constantly trying to 
say something extraordinary, playing at false enthusiasm, and 
spitting at her auditory during the trances of her ecstasis. I shall 
to-day be forced to pay a visit to that little monster which I treated 
with the utmost reserve and coldness, giving her to understand by 
friend Lassalle that the power of attraction works upon myself 
always in a centrifugal direction and that, when I happen to 
admire a person very much, I am very apt to steal altogether out 
of its presence. 
The state of things here is illboding for the powers that be. The 
Prussian Exchequer labours under a deficit, and all the old parties 
are in a movement of dissolution. The chamber of deputies will 
have to be re-elected during this season, and there is every 
probability that, during the process of its reconstitution, a great 
movement will pervade the country. This may, as my friend 
Lassalle thinks, be the proper moment for starting a newspaper g

Dear Siebel, 
The secret of my journey, which win. HAVE PUZZLED you to some 
extent, is as follows: 
As a result of the crisis in America the Cyclopaedia Americana,1  to 
which I was a contributor, has been completely suspended; 
similarly my contributions to the Tribune, my main resource, have 
been suspended until the end of April, and reduced by half for 
the period immediately thereafter (apart from myself all their 
European correspondents have been provisionally dismissed). This 
was compounded by a double misfortune: Herr Vogt, which, 
combined with the lawsuit, etc., cost me nearly £100, and a 
frightful stroke of ill-luck in that my wife (although twice 
vaccinated) caught small-pox and was ill for two months during 
which time I had to run two households, since the children 
couldn't remain at home.

So, I had to look round for other resources. Party friends here 
had already proposed to me starting a newspaper 3 in the autumn. 
Hence my presence here. More in my next. 
In the meantime, I have run into financial difficulties here (I 
shan't be staying much longer). If you could lend me 
100-150 talers, you would oblige me. 
Before returning to England I intend to see you at all events, if 
only on account of the newspaper project (for which 20,000 talers

Dear Siebel, 
A letter, which arrived from Amsterdam today, brought the 
pleasant tidings that I shall be able to SETTLE my chief financial 
difficulties (which run to hundreds of pounds), since my uncle'1 
(who looks after my mother's affairs) has declared himself 
agreeable so far as the main issue is concerned. I am thus rid of 
my chief worry, but as regards the secondary matter I wrote to you 
about,1 I shall have to rely on you. 
I am bored stiff here. I am treated as a kind of LION and am 
forced to see a great many professional 'wits', both male and 
female.  C'est  affreux.' 1 What is keeping me here (not for more than 
another  week,  I hope) is the circumstance that I refuse to leave until 
I have forced the Prussian government to recognise my REINIEGRA-
ITON. (Prima facie, 1' they are not making any difficulties about it, 
but are trying to shelve it.)

My sweet little Cousin, 
I hope you have received the letter I sent you from Berlin3 
although you were cruel enough to leave your admirer without 
one single word of acknowledgement. Now, my cruel little witch, 
how will you be able to defend such a line of conduct? Were you 
not aware that a world of Philisteans hemmed me in, and that half 
an army of antiquated beauties and detestable blue stockings, did 
their best to transform me into an ass? Old Circe, as you are 
aware, metamorphosed the companions of Ulysses into pigs.These 
modern Circes have so far civilised themselves as to take to the 
asinine line. And was it not your duty, under such circumstances, 
to come to my rescue? Beware that I take my revenge, and 
conspire with Waradje'2Si against the tranquillity of your heart.

a beautiful country to live out of it. For my own part, if I were 
quite free, and if, besides, I were not bothered by some thing you 
may call 'political conscience', I should never leave England for 
Germany, and still less for Prussia, and least of all for that affreux" 
Berlin with its 'Sand' b and its 'Bildung'' and 'seinen überwitzigen 
Leuten'. 11 
At Berlin everybody who has some spirit to lose, is of course 
extremely anxious for fellow sufferers. If the ennui, that reigns 
supreme at that place, be distributed among a greater lot of 
persons, the single individual may flatter itself to catch a lesser 
portion of it. For this reason the countess Hatzfeldt, Lassalle's 
Egeria, tried everything to prolong my sojourn in the metropolis 
of tschakose without heads. Yesterday she made her last effort, 
and we had the following scurrilous conversation: 
She. 'This, then, is the thank for the friendship we have shown 
you, that you leave Berlin so soon as your business will permit?' 
I. 'Quite the contrary. I have prolonged my stay at this place 
beyond the due term, because your amiability chained me to this 
Sahara.' 
She. 'Then I shall become still more amiable.' 
J. 'Then there remains no refuge for me but running away. 
Otherwise I should never be able to return to London whither my 
duty calls me.' 
She. 'This is a very fine compliment to tell a lady, her amiability 
is such as to drive you away!' 
/. 'You are not Berlin. If you want to prove me the sincerity of 
your amiability, do run away with  myself.' 
She. 'But I fear you will abandon me at the first station.' 
I. 'I am quite sure of not "leaving the girl behind me" f  at the 
next station. You know that when Theseus, having eloped with the 
Greek beauty/ abandoned her at some station or other, there at 
once the god Bacchus descended from the Olymp and carried the 
forlorne one in his arms to the abode of eternal pleasures. Now, I 
do not doubt but a god is already waiting for you at the first 
railway station behind Berlin, and I would be the most cruel of 
mortals to frustrate you of such a rendezvous.' 
But enough of these fooleries. In true real earnest, I feel most 
happy in the idea of soon seeing again yourself and the whole 
Bommel family circle. Recommend myself to your 'rival', h and tell

Dear Uncle, 
First, let me express my heartfelt thanks for the great friendship 
you have again shown me and the delightful hospitality extended 
to me under your  roof.  So as to avoid all suspicion of flattery, I 
shall make only the most fleeting allusion to the enormous 
pleasure I derived from consorting with a man of your experience 
who,  on the one hand, observes the passing world with so 
humane, unbiassed and original an eye and, on the other, has 
preserved intact the fire and impetuosity of youth. 
My onward journey from Bommel went entirely according to 
plan. In Rotterdam I found Jacques 1' on the pier, spent a couple 
of hours chatting with him and then, the self-same day, hurried 
on to Amsterdam, where my business was speedily settled the next 
day. Augustc  and family—this time with the addition of his wife's 
niece from Rotterdam—were well and happy. August entrusted 
me with a special mission, namely to shake up Monsieur Jacques a 
little on my return to Rotterdam, for he is suffering plus ou moins A

from 'world-weariness', an illness which may simply be attributed 
to the fact that, unlike the great majority of mankind, he is 
self-critical and has not yet succeeded in adopting any definite 
political standpoint such as might be satisfactory to  himself.  On my 
return journey from Amsterdam I got to Rotterdam at half past 
nine at night, and had to board the  STEAMER  for London at 7 o'clock 
the following morning (Sunday).'' In the short time I spent with 
Jacques it was not, of course, possible for me to answer all the 
questions he put to me or even touch very briefly on all the points 
he raised. Therefore, having previously consulted his employers, 
Jacques decided to continue our discussion in London. I arrived in 
the world capital on Monday and found the whole family well and 
cheerful. Jacques turned up last Wednesday'' and left again 
yesterday morning, to the great regret of my family who would 
have liked to keep him here longer. We have arranged to conduct 
a kind of political correspondence with one another. 
You will recall, dear Uncle, how you and I would often remark 
in jest that nowadays the rearing of human beings lags far behind 
cattle rearing. Now, having seen the whole of your family, I must 
declare you to be a virtuoso at rearing human beings. Never in my 
life have I made the acquaintance of a finer family. All your 
children have independent characters, each one an individual, 
each with his own intellectual predilections, and all equally 
distinguished by their humane culture. 
Here in London there is great consternation over the course of 
events in America.285  The acts of violence which have been 
perpetrated not only by the  SECEDED  STATES,  but also by some of the 
CENTRAI,  or RORDER  STAIES—and  it is feared that all 8 BORDER  STATES, 
namely Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, 
Arkansas, Maryland, and Delaware, will side with the secession­
ists—these acts of violence have rendered all compromise impossi­
ble. There can be no doubt that, in the early part of the struggle, 
the scales will be weighted in favour of the South, where the class 
of propertyless white adventurers provides an -inexhaustible source 
of martial militia. IN THE LONG RUN, of course, the North will be 
victorious since, if the need arises, it has a last card up its sleeve in 
the shape of a slave revolution. For the North, the great difficulty 
is the QUESTION [of] HOW TO GET THEIR FORCES TO THE SoUTH. Even AN 
UNOPPOSED  MARCH—in this season—of 15 MILES PER DAY, WOULD BE 
SOMETHING  IRYING; but Charleston, the nearest attackable point, is 544 
miles from Washington, 681 from Philadelphia, 771 from New

York and 994 from Boston, and the three last-named towns are 
the main operational bases against the South. The distance of 
Montgomery, the seat of the SECESSIONIST CONGRESS,286 from those 
same places is 910,  1,050,  1,130 and 1,350 MILES RESPECTIVELY. A 
cross-country march would therefore seem to be QUITE OUT OF THE 
QUESTION. (Use of the railways by the NORTHERN  INVADERS  would merely 
lead to their destruction.) Hence, all that remains is sea transport 
and naval warfare which, however, might easily lead to complica­
tions with foreign powers. This evening the English government is 
to announce in the Commons what ATTITUDE it intends to adopt in 
such an eventuality. 
For myself personally, developments in America are naturally 
RATHER damaging since transatlantic newspaper readers have neith­
er eyes nor ears just now for anything save their own affairs. 
However, I have received an advantageous offer from the Vienna 
Presse which I mean to accept provided certain ambiguities are 
satisfactorily cleared up. 11 I should have to write for it from 
London. My wife has a specific objection to our moving to Berlin, 
as she does not wish our daughters to be introduced into the 
Hatzfeldt circle, yet keeping them out of it altogether would be 
difficult. 
I have today had an extremely amicable letter from Lassalle. He 
has still heard nothing more from von Zedlitz, the Police President, 
regarding my  RENATURALISATION.  The conflict between police and 
public in Berlin has now, so Lassalle tells me, entered a new 
phase.

family,

MARX  TO ENGELS 287 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  7 May 1861 Dear Frederick, 
Habes confitentem reum?  But the  circonstances atténuantes*'  for my 
not writing were  as follows: D'abord c I spent,  as you'  know,  the 
greater part  of my  time  in Berlin  at Lassalle's house where  it 
would have been impossible  for me to  write  to you  without  my 
telling Lassalle what  was in the  letter,  and  THAT  DID  NOT SERVE MY 
PURPOSE. Later,  I was  continually  en route, from Berlin  to Elberfeld, 
Cologne, Trier, Aachen, Bommel, d Rotterdam,  and  Amsterdam. 
Lastly,  my  original plan,  as I  wrote  and  told  my  wife,  had  been  to 
go from Rotterdam  to Hull  and  from Hull  to Manchester  so that I 
could give  you a  detailed verbal report. This  was  frustrated  by my 
cousin Jacques Philips.  For, as I was  about  to leave Rotterdam,  he 
told me he  would  be coming  to London  the  following  day,  AND  HE 
WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD.  So, of course, I had to proceed direct to 
London  in order  to do him the  honneurs there.  He did not  leave 
here until  the day  before yesterday. 
In any  case,  I now  hope that  you  will come  to us for a few  days 
at Whitsuntide.  I heard  in Elberfeld that  you  wanted  to visit your 
family  at Whitsuntide. Even  if you do, you  could  so arrange 
matters that  you  spend  at least  a couple  of days with  us. I  have 
much  to tell you, and  this  can be  done better  by word  of mouth

London  a miss. 
First, then,  to  BUSINESS.  For a  start,  I squeezed  £160 out of my 
unclè e so that  we  were able  to pay off the  greater part  of our 
debts.  My  mother, with whom  any  discussion about cash  is out of 
the question,  but who is  rapidly nearing  her end,  destroyed some 
I.O.U.s  I had  given  her in the  past. That  was the  distinctly 
pleasant result  of the two  days  I spent with  her. I  myself said 
nothing  to her  about MONEY MATTERS  and it was she who  took  the 
initiative  in this connection. Further, when  in Berlin,  I paved  the 
way for me to  establish  a connection with  the  Vienna Presse? 88 
should  the  need arise;  in view  of the  present situation  in America, 
this will doubtless prove indispensable. Finally,  I have arranged

through Lassalle for the second part of my political economy 8 to 
be published by Brockhaus instead of Duncker. As to Duncker, 
Camilla Essig (alias Ludmilla Assing) rightly remarked to me that, 
if one wants to keep a book secret, one must get Duncker to 
publish it. However, I do at least figure in the recent piece by 
Rau-Rau a—the German Say. 
Apropos. With regard to your Po and Rhine, etc., I am told by la 
Hatzfeldt—who converses with all the Prussian generals at the 
house of her brother-in-law, General von Nostitz, and whose 
nephew Nostitz is, furthermore, an aide-de-camp to 'handsome 
William'b —that your pamphlet is considered in high, if not the 
highest, military circles (including, inter alia, that of Prince Charles 
Frederick) to be the product of an anonymous Prussian general. 
The same thing happened in Vienna, or so I was told by assessor 
Friedländer (brother of the editor of the Vienna Presse). I myself 
have discussed it with General Pfuel, now 82, but still mentally 
alert and become very radical. Pfuel didn't know, of course, that 
we had conferred on him the honorary title of 'von Höllenstein'. 289 
He has, by the by, fallen out of favour and is ranked by the Court 
with the Jacobins, atheists, etc. 
NOW tO POLITICAL BUSINESS. 
In Berlin there is, of course, no haute politique? Everything 
revolves round the struggle with the police (not that the latter are 
in the least presumptuous just now, being a model of civility and 
tolerance) in that people would like to see Zedlitz, Patzke, etc., 
removed from office and punished; secondly, round the opposi­
tion between the military and civilians. It is over these issues (in 
bourgeois circles, other particularly sore points are the military 
bills and tax exemption for the landowners) that matters will come 
to a head.290  (Count Tavernier, an artillery officer, told me that 
they would like nothing better than to turn their batteries on the 
Garde du Corps.) The prevailing atmosphere is one of general 
dissolution, and people of every rank regard a catastrophe as 
inevitable. This would seem to be more the case in the capital than 
in the provinces. Curiously enough, military circles share the 
general conviction that the first clash with the crapauds d will result 
in a trouncing for the Prussians. Berlin is in a cheeky, frivolous 
mood. The Chambers are despised. In one theatre I visited, a 
comical ditty about Vincke was sung to the accompaniment of loud 
a K. H. Rau, Lehrbuch der politischen Oekonomie. Bd. I, Grundsätze der Volks-
wirthschaftslehre, Leipzig und Heidelberg, 1860. - b William I - r high politics -

applause. Among a broad section of the public there is much 
dissatisfaction with the existing press. At the coming new elections 
(in the autumn) to the Second Chamber, there is no doubt that 
most of the fellows who sat in the Prussian National Assembly will 
be elected.291 This is important, not on account of the said fellows, 
but because 'William the Handsome' mistakes them for red 
republicans. All in all, 'handsome William' has been dogged by the 
spectre rouge'1 ever since he became king. He considers his 
popularity as a 'liberal' to be a trap set for him by the overthrow 
party. 
Now, under the circumstances it might, in fact, not be 
inopportune if we could bring out a paperb  in Berlin next year, 
although I personally find the place unpleasant. 20-30,000 talers 
would have to be got together in association with Lassalle, etc. BUT 
hie facet' Lassalle put the proposal to me direct. At the same time, 
he confided that he would have to be editor en chef along with 
myself.  And Engels? I inquired. 'Well, if three aren't too many, 
Engels can also be editor en  chef,  of course. Though you two ought 
not to have more votes than me, for other-wise I would always be 
outvoted.' As reasons why he, too, must take the helm he stated: 1. 
that he was generally regarded as being closer to the bourgeois 
party and hence could procure funds more easily; 2. that he 
would have to sacrifice his 'theoretical studies' and his theoretical 
tranquillity and ought, after all, to get something out of it, etc. If, 
however, we were unwilling, he went on: 'I would still be 
prepared, as before, to assist the paper financially and in literary 
ways;  that would be an advantage to me; for I should have the 
benefit of the paper without the responsibility for it,' etc. This was 
just sentimental hot air, of course. Lassalle, dazzled by the esteem 
earned him in certain learned circles by his Heraclitus A and, in 
another circle, consisting of spongers, by his good wine and food, 
doesn't know, of course, that he is of ill repute with the public at 
large. And then his intractability; his obsession with the 'specula­
tive concept' (the fellow actually dreams of a new Hegelian 
philosophy raised to the second power,  v. hich he intends to write), 
his inoculation with early French liberalism, his arrogant pen, 
importunity, tactlessness, etc. If subjected to rigid discipline, 
Lassalle might be of service as one of the editors. Otherwise, we 
would simply make fools of ourselves. But, in view of the great 
friendliness he showed me, you can see how difficult it was for me

to speak my mind. So, I was generally non-committal and told him 
I could settle nothing without prior discussion with you and 
Lupus. (That was the main reason why I didn't write to you from 
Berlin, for I didn't want to have a reply from you about this while 
I was there.) If we decide against it, the countessa  and Lassalle 
intend to set out on a year's trip to the East or to Italy. BUT HERES 
THE RUB. b He now expects me to give him an answer, which I can't 
put off any longer. Qu'en dis-tu? c 
He's a frightfully pompous fellow, and so I had no alternative 
but to be constantly ironical at his expense, which wounded his 
amour-propre, the more so in that it aroused in the countess, 
whom he has impressed as a universal genius, a disquieting urge 
to emancipate herself from this Buddha. At certain times, 
strangely enough, la Hatzfeldt's voice has a Jewish intonation that 
has been acquired from and instilled in her by him. 
Lupus's reservations about the Prussian police are  QUITE  OUT  OP 
PLACE. The only difficulty that still remains can at most affect those 
who had formerly taken the military oath of allegiance. Assessor 
Friedländer tells me that Lupus is STILL THE MOST POPULAR MAX in 
Breslau and in another district of Silesia as well, I forget the 
name. Eisner has turned into a good-for-nothing on the Schlesische 
Zeitung, just as Stein has on the Breslauer. Nevertheless, a go-ahead 
democratic party has again been formed in Breslau. The enclosed 
excerpt from the Preussische Gerichts-Zeitung was inserted at my 
instigation by its editor, Stadtrichter Hiersemenzel. d Actuarius 
Stein, who has returned to Berlin from Zurich, sends Lupus his 
kindest regards. 
You shall hear of my negotiations with the Prussian government 
and/or police in my next letter.292 
Apropos. I have a present for you from Lassalle, a fine military 
atlas,  which you must come and fetch in person. 
Salut to you, Lupus and Gumpert.

IN BERLIN 
London, 8 May 1861 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Lazarus, 
Post tot discrimina rerum." If anyone is responsible for my 
silence—during my travels, that is, for here in London I had to 
spend my first week playing Amphitryon 13 to my cousin from 
Rotterdamc —it is the countess/ She had promised that I would 
find her portrait and a letter from her at Zalt-Bommel. Since 
neither of these materialised, and since I am a strict observer of 
the jus vindictae* I didn't write either. In addition, my time at 
Bommel was completely taken up. On the one hand, I had 
business with my uncle,' and on the other, I had to pay court to 
my cousin. 8 So, YOU SEE, SIR, WRITING  WAS  OUT  OF THE QUESTION. My stay in 
Trier was useful in as much as my mother destroyed some old 
I.O.U.s. Incidentally the old woman also intrigued me by her 
exceedingly subtle esprit and unshakable equanimity. 
First, then, to the financial side. Herewith an interim payment 
of £20. You still have £10 to come. The concatenation of 
circumstances was as follows: My uncle gave me £150 in cash to 
pay bills due at the beginning of May. He promised to send a 
further bill to London a few weeks later. In the meantime, 
therefore, I borrowed the enclosed £20 from my cousin,r ditto 
some money for the household, and a third amount for the 
repayment of various small loans in Germany. If, however, you 
must have the outstanding £10 straight away, let me know at once. 
I couldn't go to Manchester as I had originally planned h  because 
my cousin from Rotterdam  ' decided to travel to London hard on 
my heels. The pretext was his interest in discussing politics with 
me.  IN FACE, however, I believe he wanted to make the 
acquaintance of his various female cousins. I wrote to Engels the 
day before yesterday about the plans for the newspaper' and shall

doubtless have  an answer from  him in a day or so.  Conditions  in 
America will probably  be such that, even  if nothing comes  of the 
newspaper enterprise,  I may  move  to Berlin  for a  semester  or 
thereabouts,  ALWAYS  SUPPOSED THAT  I GET  MY RENATURALISATION. London,  I 
CANT  DENY  IT, possesses an extraordinary fascination for me, 
although,  to a  certain extent,  I live  a hermit's life  in this gigantic 
place. 
Apropos. Blanqui  is still in Mazas prison293 (Paris) where  he is 
being physically maltreated  by the  gendarmes,  etc., on the 
instructions  of the  examining magistrate. Taking advantage  of the 
general amnesty,  he had  travelled from here  to Paris—with  no 
plans  for conspiracy whatever—as  an agent  for a  businessman.  In 
England,  as elsewhere  in Europe,  the scoundrelly press  TRIES  TO BURKE 
THE WHOLE AFFAIR.  I have made  an appointment  for  next Saturday 
with Simon Bernard, who knows more about  the  matter,294  and we 
shall then discuss  the  subject thoroughly.  We  intend, possibly  in 
concert with Ernest Jones,  to hold  a PUBLIC MEETING about this 
outrage.  As  soon  as I  have spoken  to Bernard  and am  better 
informed  I shall send  a report  to the  countess.  But I  would  ask you to 
see to it at  once through  one  channel  or another that  an item about 
this guet-apens* appears  in the  Breslau papers.  The  German papers 
reprint  one  another's  stuff, as you  know. 
To turn from tragedy  to tragi-comedy,  did you see in the 
newspapers that workers  in Geneva boxed Fazy's ears  in broad 
daylight? 
Kossuth's behaviour here during  the  lawsuit295  was  lamentable. 
Having  at first taken  the  floor with such swagger  in his  AFFIDAVITS, 
etc., he bowed  and  scraped during  the  hearing  itself,  assumed  as 
insignificant  and  subdued  an air as  possible, disavowed  all 
revolutionary designs  or intentions  on his own  part  and  thus 
stupidly deprived himself  of the  sympathies  of a  public predis­
posed  in favour  of such melodramatic characters. 
I don't know whether  you  have followed  the  parliamentary 
debates  on the  MacDonald CASE.296 Palmerston's provocative  be­
haviour towards Prussia11  has, in  fact,  no  other  aim  than  to 
explode  the  idea (Schleinitz's)  of an  Anglo-Prussian alliance.  I 
need hardly tell  you to  what purpose,  for you  know  the  story.

Countess Hatzfeldt is said to have offered me 20,000 talers to 
found a newspaper. Secundo, I had imagined that Herr Vogt had won 
me support among the middle classes, on which score, however, I 
suffered a bitter disappointment. And, ultimo, I gave 
the thing up in despair, since 'not one man of letters' wished to have 
'anything to do' with me. Good shot, Toby! 
Rodbertus's pamphleta is highly commendable as regards its 
tendency. Otherwise, what is good in it isn't new and what is new 
in it isn't good. Roscherb  on the other hand is the true 
representative of professorial erudition. Fausse  science,"  as Fourier 
would say. 
Don't forget to knock at Brockhaus's doord; 10-20 sheets, for I 
can never estimate the length in advance. 
And now, mon cher, I must conclude by most cordially thanking 
you for the kind and amiable way in which you took me in and 
entertained me and, more especially, put up with my incivilities. 
As you know, I was beset by worries and am also troubled with my 
liver. But the chief thing is that we laughed together a great deal. 
Simia non ridetf and thus we have shown ourselves to be truly 
consummate Buddhas.

I would ask you to convey my best respects, and one for  yourself.

photographs I had been given in Germany and Holland. Secondly, 
a cutting from a Düsseldorf paper about Herr Vogt. Lastly, I 
enclose a copy of the Free Press b which is admittedly somewhat 
out-of-date, since you and Lupus did not, perhaps, follow the 
parliamentary debate on the Afghanistan affair very closely. It. was 
the greatest  CHECK  Pam had experienced since 1848.207 
What you say about the plan for a newspaper in Berlin 
corresponds precisely to my own view and I had already, mutatis 
mutandis,c intimated the main points to Lazarus.d And—though I 
had already told him positively in Berlin that I would undertake 
nothing of the kind without you and Lupus—I had, nevertheless, 
positively pledged myself to lay the matter before you 'seriously 
and objectively', and thus salvavi animam meam.e 
Apropos Lassalle-Lazarus. In his magnum opus on Egypt,' 
Lepsius proved that the exodus of the Jews from Egypt was 
nothing other than the story Manetho relates of the expulsion 
from Egypt of 'the leper folk', with an Egyptian priest named 
Moses at their head. Lazarus the leper is thus the archetype of the 
Jew and of Lazarus-Lassalle. Save that in our Lazarus's case, 
leprosy has gone to the brain. Originally, his disease was secondary 
syphilis that wasn't properly cured. As a result, he developed 
caries in one of his legs, and something of this still remains, 
according to his doctor, Frerich g (I don't know how that famous 
professor spells it), in the form of neuralgia or SOMETHING  OF THE  SORT 
in one of his legs. To the detriment of his own physique, our 
Lazarus is now living as luxuriously as his counterpart, the rich 
man,h  and it is this, I think, that is mainly preventing his recovery. 
He has acquired altogether too much refinement and would, for 
instance, regard going into a pub as an outrage. Curiously 
enough, he asked me at least four times whom I meant by Jacob 
Wiesenriesler' in Vogt. However, considering his vanity, which has 
now grown truly 'objective', this was only usus naturae) We are all 
to be sent his new legal masterpiece (Dharma). 298 
While in Berlin I also went to see Friedrich Koppen. I found 
him still very much as he always was. Only he's grown stouter, and 
'grizzled'. I went out on the spree with him twice and it was a real

treat for me. He made me a present of his two volume Buddha," an 
important work. Amongst other things, he told me how those 
scoundrels, Zabel et cie, had gained possession of the National-
Zeitung. That paper was originally founded in 1848, with a fully 
paid-up share capital (but with no proper contract, IN  A LOOSE  WAY). 
Mügge, Koppen, and others, exerted themselves to that end. 
Rutenberg became editor-in-chief, with Zabel as his deputy, and, 
lastly, the Jew  Wolff b as manager. The paper made rapid headway 
as a result of its pale-ale-swigging philistine moderation and its 
service to the parliamentary Left.299  Rutenberg was elbowed out by 
his sociis c on the pretext, false or real, that he was adopting too 
conservative a line and was accepting gratifications from Han­
semann. Zabel brought in a faiseur d who did his writing for him, 
while Zabel frequented sundry public houses where he conversed 
with pale-ale-swigging philistines and thus ensured the growth of 
the paper's popularity. The coup d'état (Manteuffel's) 30° and the 
various arbitrary anti-press measures, the severity of which did not 
abate until the end of 1850, provided a welcome excuse not to 
convene the shareholders. Meanwhile, the paper, which, with 
the suppression of the revolutionary press and the rise of the 
Hinckeldey-Stieber régime, found itself for the first time in its 
true element, acquired stature in the eyes of the philistines. It 
became a going concern and, in ABOUT 1852, some of the 
shareholders grew importunate and demanded a statement of 
accounts, a general meeting, etc. The most refractory were then 
taken on one side by Jew Wolff and divinity student Zabel. It was 
divulged to them in confidence that, if the paper were not to be 
ruined, dead silence must be religiously kept in respect of its 
finances, since it was, in fact, bankrupt. (In fact, the shares, 
originally 25 talers, were by then already worth 100.) So, on no 
account must it be flushed, d'une manière ou d'une autre? out of its 
shy financial retreat. As a special concession, however, an exception 
would be made in their (i.e., the most troublesome shareholders') 
case and the amount they had invested would be returned to them 
in exchange for their shares. In this way, the most dangerous were 
indemnified. This farce was repeated on several occasions. The 
majority of those who were thus bought off, however, received  — 
strictly in proportion to the passive resistance they put up—at the 
most 40, at the lowest 5%, of the sum they had originally invested.

To this day, a considerable proportion of the liberal milksops have 
not received a FARTHING, nor are they any more capable of 
extracting a statement of accounts. They keep silent for fear of the 
Kreuz-Zeitung? Such is the escroquerie h that has enabled Jew Wolff 
and divinity student Zabel to become leading dignitaries of 
liberalismus vulgaris, with 'surplus money' at their disposal. A pity I 
hadn't heard this tale before! 
Rutenberg has been handed over by Manteuffel to Schwerin as 
an expressly guaranteed item of stock-in-trade. With his scissors he 
is now snipping the Staatszeitung to rights—a paper nobody reads 
any more. A type of London Gazette. Bruno, c who is said to have 
fared hellish badly, vainly offered his services to the present 
ministry—i.e., in the form of continued contributions to the 
semi-official Preussische Zeitung. He is now the principal con­
tributor to Wagener's (Kreuz-Zeitung) Staatslexikon. Besides, he's a 
FARMER at  Rixdorf,  or whatever the miserable hole is called. 
One day, I witnessed a session of the second chamber from the 
press gallery. I had similarly witnessed a session of the Prussian 
Agreers301  in the summer of 1848. Quantum mutatum ab illis! d Not 
that they were Titans either—far from it! A cramped assembly 
room. Nothing much in the way of visitors' galleries. The fellows 
sit on benches (as compared with the arm-chairs of the 'Gentle­
men'), 302 an odd combination of government office and school­
room. A Belgian Chamber is imposing by comparison. Simson or 
Samson, or whatever the president's name is, avenges  himself— 
with all the grotesque and brutal magisteriality of a ministerial 
huissier" 303—for the kicks dealt him by Manteuffel when dispens­
ing discipline with his ass's jawbones among the philistines 
cowering below. In any other assembly this unspeakable SPECIES of 
servile insolence personified would already have had his ears 
boxed. In Berlin one is repelled, especially at the theatre, by the 
prevalence of uniforms (apropos, in the very first few days, la 
Hatzfeldt took me to a box close to that of 'handsome William' 
and company, in order to insult the royal family. Three hours of 
ballet. This was the only performance of the evening. Yet another 
aspect of Berlin), yet one cannot but rejoice when one espies, here 
and there among the crowd of kow-towing bureaucratic school­
boys,  some chap in uniform who at least holds his head erect and 
sits up straight. Vincke happened_ to be speaking—indeed, he

the fellow. Had I heard him speak before, the portrait would have 
turned out very differently.304  In an indifferent comedy, Die 
Journalisten, by Freytag which I saw in Berlin, one of the 
characters is a fat Hamburg philistine and wine MERCHANT named 
Piepenbrink. Vincke is the spit and image of this Piepenbrink. 
The most revolting Hamburg-Westphalian patois, a torrent of 
hastily gabbled words, not a sentence correctly constructed or 
complete. And this is the Mirabeau of Hasenheide! a The only 
figures in this gathering of pygmies who at least look decent are 
Waldeck, on one side, and Wagener and Don Quixote von 
Blanckenburg, b on the other. 
Went to see Siebel in Elberfeld. Had supper with him in 
Barmen. Pretty, young wife, sings well, admires her Carl—found 
her not unpleasing. Siebel just the same as ever. Consorts mainly 
with a liberal journalist (formerly Münster correspondent to the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung)," poets, musicians, and painters. The best 
among them, I thought, was Seel. Siebel took me to the 
'California' in Barmen, a boring bunch. They drank my health. I 
got Siebel to tell them I had lost my voice, and he replied on my 
behalf with a few boring jokes which, however, were in the RIGHT 
PLACE. Siebel says that his father copies everything he does— 
writing verse and drinking, so that he's said to be a block, off the 
young chip. 
In Cologne I called on Schneider II and Dr Klein. Just the same 
as ever—if anything, have gone even further. Spent a couple of 
hours tippling with them. In one pub saw, also incognito, 
Stuhlgang Königswinter (Wolfgang Müller). d Called on Mrs 
Daniels. Not that ninny and National Association man Bürgers. 
But more about this later. I've indulged in so much chat that I 
haven't yet touched on essentials. Some more anon.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 16 May 1861 
DEAR  Frederick, 
I missed Gumpert. First, I went to Euston Square 305 at 5 in the 
afternoon and waited there till 6. Later on, at  ABOUT  8 OCLOCK,  I went 
to London Bridge Station. In neither case did I catch him. 
Perhaps you would be so kind as to write and tell us when you 
are coming.3 
As regards your own relations with Prussia,13  let me begin by 
giving you the opinion of the leading jurists with whom I spoke in 
Berlin. Everything depends upon whether or not you were conscripted. 
If not, your  CASE  as a Landwehr 41 man is one for the ordinary civil 
courts. It would seem, by the by, that the Prussians are officially 
concerned only with your Elberfeld affair, not the one in Baden. 306 
I don't know if you have read the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung 
of 19 April last. The final news item from Paris c reads (I quote): 
'By way of a warning to booksellers, Herr Vogt by Karl Marx has been placed on 
the list of proscribed books, thus frustrating the appearance of a much abridged 
French version, which is now in press.' 
I had intended to give you a further account of my journey 
today, but Mr Bühring has just come to see me, so I must get this 
note off. 
Salut. 
Your

MARX  TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 307 
IN BERLIN 
[London,]  29 May 1861 
Dear Lassalle, 
I have written  to a  frienda  in Germany42  who,  I hope, will send 
you the  remaining  £10 (67  talers) within  a week  at the  latest.  I'm 
horribly  put out by  this business,  but my  uncle, b as is the  wont  of 
such old  gentlemen,while  on the  whole doing what  he promised,  is 
at least creating difficulties  for me. 
Because  of  conditions over there,308  my  American articlesc 
continue  to be  wholly  in abeyance  for the  time being,  and  will so 
continue until circumstances  in Europe again acquire some interest 
for the  TRANSATLANTICS, 
In Paris  the  workers  are in a  most sorry plight  as a  result  of the 
American crisis. Ditto  in Lyons. 
The whole  of the  official press  in England  is, of  course,  in 
favour  of the  SLAVEHOLDERS.  They  are the  selfsame fellows  who  have 
wearied  the  world with their  ANTISLAVE TRADE  philanthropy.  But 
COTTON, COTTON! 
Engels  has been here  on a  three-day visit.  He is not yet  going  to 
move.  If he did so, he'd  have  to give  up his  position, break  his 
contract  and  incur severe financial loss,  and  this,  he declares,  he is 
unwilling to do  SAVE  IN DECISIVE  TIMES,  nor has he any intention of 
falling, perhaps before  3 months  are out,  into  the  clutches  of 
Prussia's common law  WITHOUT DOING  ANY  GOOD  TO  ANYBODY. d Cir­
cumstances,  he  thinks,  are not yet  ripe  for the  setting  up of a 
paper/ He thanks you very much for the  MILITARY  MAPS. 
In my  letter  to the  countess309  which  you  passed  on to her, I 
gave  her a  more circumstantial  and  accurate account  of 
Bonaparte's infamy vis-à-vis Blanqui, indeed  of the  WHOLE CASE!  No 
doubt  she  will have told  you  about  it. Please convey  my  kindest 
regards  to her. I  hope  she is now in  better health. 
I am  curious  to  hear more about your  TRANSACTIONS  with  the 
Prussian government.  THANKS  for the  zeal  you  have displayed.

Dear Frederic, 
I have had a letter from Vienna today. To start with, 
Friedländer b wants me to send him 2 articles, 1 about the business 
in America (in which I am to provide a brief political and military 
résumé of the whole mess, for 1 or 2 leaders) and 1 on the 
situation in England. Later (i.e. when he has had these articles) he 
will let me have his further suggestions; and, in fact, I am to get 
£1 for each article, 10/- for mere news-letters. This is good pay by 
German standards and I shall have to agree to the thing, car il faut 
vivre. c Since I should like to get the 2 sample articles off this week, 
you must do^the military part about America for me.d I will then 
fit it into the political part. 
A week ago I made a serious start on my book.31 " Have heard 
nothing more of Lassalle, save  • what his cousin Friedländer e 
(Lassalle does not and must not know anything about the 
transactions with the Presse) wrote and told me from Berlin, 
namely:

by his excessive zeal and his memoranda tending to prove too much, and partly 
spending his time perusing and reading out loud the numerous letters that pour in 
from professors and privy councillors thanking him for a book so fine, so interesting 
and so witty, etc.2  These letters provide him with a grand opportunity to make 
conversation about his "excellent" book, thus proving that he is quite insensible to 
little titillations of this kind and wholly immune to vanity. The poor countess, b who 
is fighting off a severe attack of influenza, finds it ever more difficult to play her 
official role of opposer, and I, too, am beginning to tire of acting as seconder.' 
So much for Friedländer. 
As regards the goings-on in. the so-called National Association257 
down here and Kinkel's consequent downfall, I shall write 
tomorrow, having still to write to Berlin and Vienna today.

Dear Lassalle, 
Perhaps you would be so kind as to pass on the enclosed letter 
to the countess.313 
Many thanks for your book," which arrived here a day or two 
since (I immediately sent the other copies to their respective 
destinations in Manchester). I began at the end, namely with the 
Pelasgian affair, and then went back to the law of succession at the 
beginning, having now progressed as far as p. 215. It is an 
important work in every respect. However, I cannot send you a 
criticism, assessment, etc., until I have read right through the

whole thing. Merely en passant, then: In India, adoption is the 
prevailing form. English law has taken a course diametrically 
opposed to that of French law. Complete testamentary freedom 
(whereby no Englishman or Yankee is compelled to leave his 
family a farthing) dates back to the bourgeois revolution of 1688 
and evolved in the same measure as 'bourgeois' property 
developed in England. Thus, it would seem after all that, aside 
from its specifically Roman origins, etc., complete testamentary 
freedom, indeed the making of wills generally, is a DELUSION, which, 
in bourgeois society too, must have roots of its own, independent 
of mythology, etc. 
I have, alas, had a letter from Germany saying tha,t the £10 
cannot be remitted to you before the end of this month. Until then, I 
must trust to your diplomatic finesse. As you know, I was 
disagreeably surprised by the fact that my uncle,3 who honoured 
the bills I currently owed, put off giving me the additional amount 
I asked for until SOME MONTHS LATER. All the same, I couldn't help 
laughing at such a typically Dutch turn of events. 
Whether or not I am accorded Prussian nationality there might 
still be some question of myself and FAMILY travelling to Berlin on 
my passport as a 'foreigner', and spending the winter there.

Manchester, 12 June 1861 Dear Moor, 
Unfortunately, I haven't been keeping any newspapers on the 
American war, besides many of the places are not to be found on 
the map. The essential points are as follows: 
The South had been quietly arming for years, particularly since 
a Lion Philips

the fuss over the presidential elections203 and, at the very last 
moment, had received money and arms en masse as a result of the 
treachery on the part of Buchanan's ministers.315 By 4 March, 
therefore, the North was completely crippled. Moreover, prior to 
the fall of Sumter,285 Lincoln did not or could not do anything, 
save effect a somewhat greater concentration of his few regular 
troops (18,000 in all, the majority scattered about the West on 
anti-Indian duties) and refurbish their equipment. Now finally, 
after the attack on Sumter, the North was sufficiently aroused to 
silence all outbursts on the part of the opposition, thereby making 
powerful military action a possibility. 75,000 men were drafted 
and may now be serving, but it would seem that ten times that 
number were eager to volunteer, so that there may be up to 
100,000 men now serving even though they won't by any means 
have been concentrated yet. A further call-up by Lincoln is 
expected daily and will take less time, for everything is better 
prepared now. The 75,000 men, or rather the element occupying 
positions in the Washington region, on the Ohio facing Kentucky, 
and in St Louis (Missouri) (i.e. not counting the reserves in Ohio 
and Pennsylvania), have been sufficient for the time being to 
restore the balance between the forces of North and South along 
the line of the Potomac and momentarily even to permit a limited 
offensive by the North. 
For the South, just as for the North, the primary objective was 
Washington. The South's offensive in that direction was far too 
weak; beyond Richmond the main force was evidently not strong 
enough to put in a timely thrust. All they managed to do was send 
a mobile column to Harper's Ferry on the Potomac above 
Washington. This POSITION is ideally suited to an offensive against 
the North (Maryland and Pennsylvania), for it lies at the 
confluence of the Shenandoah, an important river, and the 
Potomac, is extremely strong tactically and commands both rivers 
completely. Seemingly, it was not without intent that the Federal 
Armory was sited up there by a government that foresaw and 
favoured future secession. The occupation of Harper's Ferry 
disrupts the control of the Potomac line by Union troops at a 
sensitive spot and will immediately afford the Southern troops 
complete command of both banks, assuming they advance en masse 
to this line. 
The fate of Maryland and Delaware was dependent on 
Washington being held by the North; cut off from the South and 
occupied by Union troops, they at once fell to the Union. A 
second success for the North. 

=====第332页=====
296 175. Engels to Marx. 12 June 1861 
The reconquest of Missouri by the St Louis Germans316 was the 
third success and one of enormous importance, for whoever holds 
St Louis blocks the Mississippi. The extent to which Kentucky's 
neutrality is favourable to North or South will probably depend on 
circumstances and events. For the time being, at any rate, it will 
restrict the theatre of war toa the area that lies further east.b 
Result: Thus, for all its preparations, the South has achieved 
nothing, save that the North, after only 1 month's preparation, has 
already wrested from it the national capital and three slave states, 
while a fourth slave state doesn't dare secede;317 also that the 
South's offensive on the Potomac has come to a halt, whereas the 
North has already advanced beyond this river, as yet without 
meeting resistance. For every man the South can still produce, the 
North will produce three or four. The seceded states have about 
7'/2 million inhabitants, of which more than 3 million are slaves; a 
minimum of 1 million whites must be deducted to guard the 
slaves, so that barely 2V2 million are left as the aggregate of the 
population available for war. If 10% of these are mobilised, 
probably the largest number ever mobilised for defensive pur­
poses,  this will produce at most 250,000 men. But there would 
certainly not be a muster of that order. Switzerland, with pretty 
well the same population—rather more than 2 millions—has on 
paper about 160,000 militiamen. By contrast the North — 
reckoning the free states alone—numbers nearly 20 millions, all 
of whom are available with the exception, perhaps, of California, 
Utah and the territories in the far West. If we say the available 
population amounts to 17 millions and if we assume that not 10% 
but simply one third of that, i.e. 3Vs%, are available for an 
offensive war, we arrive at over 500,000 men, more than enough to 
quell the South, even if it exerts itself to the utmost. Man for man, 
there is no question that the people from the North are markedly 
superior to those from the South, both physically and morally. 
Your pugnacious SOUTHERNER has a good deal of the cowardly 
assassin in him. Each of them goes about armed, but only because 
this will enable him, during a quarrel, to fell his antagonist before the 
latter expects to be attacked. That is the aver...

MARX TO ENGELS 249 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 19 June 3 1861 
Dear Frederick, 
I have put off writing for so long because Weber (the Palatine 
watchmaker) had promised me a report on the London National 
Association257 meeting, which was the scene of Kinkel's strange 
experience and was attended by Weber as a guest. I did not 
receive the enclosed from him until today. You will have seen 
from the last Hermann what it was all about.b The final meeting 
has been adjourned until Saturday week.c  In the meantime, Juch, 
having been given the necessary  SUPPLIES  by a German businessman 
in the CITY, has set off to Coburg with the intention of getting the 
central committee of the National Association there to expel Zerffi 
(and hence implicite 6 Kinkel). It's really splendid that Gottfried's 
boot-licking attitude to the English should have inspired such 
fanatical rage in all the liberal bourgeois in the CITY. 
Letters have even arrived from Bonn, threatening Gottfried 
'with a drubbing' should he return. The secret behind the support 
given to MacDonald by Zerffi (no doubt acting on instructions) 
and Gottfried318 is this: Gottfried holds an English appointment as 
lecturer at the Kensington Museum,319  the good Zerffi likewise at 
an Ashley (Shaftesbury)" INSTITUTION. Gottfried's only ALLIES are the 
louts of the 'apolitical' choral and other drinking societies. Last 
week Gottfried bribed these people (probably with English money) 
to join the National Association en bloc. (For anyone can become a 
member of the beastly association by obtaining a card from 
Trübner, at a MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION of 3/-.) Again, Gottfried held a 
private meeting of his followers and sent a deputation to 
Heintzmann asking him to resign voluntarily (on account of the 
insult to Gottfried's dignity) from his position as chairman, failing 
which a motion would be proposed to that end. 
BY THE  BY, I should not forget to tell you that, while the row was 
going on, my friend Rheinländer joined the National Association

Londoner Mitglieder des Nationalvereins am 1. Juni 1861',  Hermann, No. 128,

(after talking it over with me), and brought in some fifty members 
(mostly clerks) from his Islington Choral Society; it was they more 
than anyone else who kicked up the anti-Gottfried row. 
Rheinländer tells me that never before has the German business 
contingent in the City taken sides so fanatically over a political 
issue. How priceless it would be if Gottfried were forced to resign 
from the National Association because of his kow-towing to a 
foreign government! That would put paid to his status among the 
German MIDDLE CLASS  riff-raff,  and where would he be without 
them? Gottfried is aware that this is the issue upon which he will 
stand or fall, and is therefore busying himself after his own 
fashion. What particularly irks him just now is the way everyone is 
saying that 'the Volk and "Marx" had been right about him after 
all'. 320 He told an acquaintance of Hirschfeld's, the printer, that the 
'Brimstone Gang65 were the invisible leaders of the whole 
business'. Nice, is it not, that we, who haven't raised a finger, 
should be endowed by our enemies with such mystical 'powers'? 
The second enclosure I am sending you (which please return as 
I have got to answer it) is a letter from la Hatzfeldt.321  I shall keep 
her as my private correspondent in Berlin as she has incomparably 
more political nous (not to mention her good contacts) than 'the 
step that bears in itself the systematic principle of its walking'. 
(Lassalle, Vol. II, p. 545.) a (Apropos. I presume you and Lupus 
have had L.'s opus?) There are two passages in her letter I should 
explain to you. With regard to the Blanqui affair, I had arranged 
for a letter to be sent her from Brussels (from Denonville).b 
Initially, it's a matter of obtaining money to print a pamphlet, 
emanating from Denonville, about the—infamous—Blanqui trial. 
(Debates, etc., and discussion thereof.) Blanqui himself has, 
through Denonville, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to me and to 
the parti prolétaire allemand (in partibus) c for the sympathy we have 
shown him.322 I consider it a very good thing that we should again 
have direct links with the decidedly revolutionary party in France. 
Second point: In the letter in which I notified Lassalle that there 
was nothing doing just now so far as the newspaper was 
concerned, I endeavoured to sugar the pill by saying that I might 
perhaps come to Berlin next winter. d 
a F. Lassalle, Das System der erworbenen Rechte. - b Louis Watteau - c German 
proletarian party (in exile). In partibus infidelium—literally: in parts inhabited by 
infidels. The words are added to the title of Roman Catholic bishops holding purely 
nominal dioceses in non-Christian countries. - d See this volume, pp. 283-84.

176. Marx to  Engels.  19 June 1861 299 
La Hatzfeldt's assessments of official democracy in Berlin is 
perfectly correct. She doesn't, of course, come into contact with 
the genuine rank and file, nor, of course, is she familiar with the 
prevailing mood in the pubs—which is better. 
Many thanks for your letter about America.3 If anything of 
importance (military) should happen, you will, I presume, not fail 
to write and let me have your views about it. From the picture I 
have gained of General Scott—now 76, to boot—from the 
Mexican War323 (see Ripley1'), I would expect him to make 
tremendous  BLUNDERS—if,  that is, the old jackass isn't supervised by 
others. Above all, slow and irresolute. Incidentally, from the facts 
appearing in the Tribune I see that the North is now speaking 
openly of a slave war and the abolition of slavery/ 
Yesterday in the COMMONS, on the occasion of the Schleswig-
Holstein affair, Lord Montagu, having previously given notice of 
his intention, raised the matter of Palmerston's London Protocol 
(on the Danish Succession) of 1850, 324 etc. The Old Mand had 
recourse to his usual method. Hardly had Montagu embarked on 
his speech than he was brought up short by a pre-arranged 
COUNT-OUT  of the House. 
On Saturday'' I have £2 to pay out in rates and should be most 
grateful if you could send this to me. At the beginning of July I shall 
be getting a bit more money. The fact that I have already spent what 
I brought back with me will not surprise you, since, besides the 
debts which occasioned the trip,278 nothing has been coming in for 
nearly 4 months, while school and doctor alone ate up nearly £40. 
What's this about L. Simon, of whom there is some mention in 
the last part of la Hatzfeldt's letter?325  Was Simon in the 
Landwehr 41? At any rate, you have sinned more 326 than Ludwig 
(who was nowhere in the field, etc.). I don't understand the 
business. Regards to Lupus.

MARX  TO  ENGELS 249 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  1 July  1861 
Dear Frederic, 
I was  delighted  to see  Lupus here,  as was the  whole  FAMILY. 
Despite  his  gout,  the old man had  quite  a youthful  air. He 
immediately handed over-your letter,232  and £2,  which promptly 
went to the  TAX  GATHERER.  I was expecting to get a  SUPPLY  from 
Germany this morning,  but  nothing  has  arrived  yet.  Since  I am 
completely without  REVENUE  for the time being and yet  IN A CONTINUAL 
COURSE OF CONSUMPTION  (this being  how  some economists account  for 
'profit', which they  see as  deriving,  not  from  the  costs  of 
production,  but  from  the  costs  of consumption327),  any  supplies 
from Manchester would  be  most welcome. 
Please write  and  tell me at  once what  you  think about  the  moves 
(military)  in  Virginia.  The  BLUNDERS  made  by  officers  of the 
militia—-Brigadier-General Pierce,  by nature  a 'tailor' from  the  State 
of Massachusetts—will,  of  course, recur often enough  on'  both 
sides. 328 Is Washington still threatened?  Do you  believe that  the 
SOUTHERNERS'  position at Manassas  JUNCTION  is an offensive one? Or 
aren't  the  fellows engaged rather  in a  withdrawal?  In Missouri  the 
defeat  of the  SOUTHERNERS  seem certain,329  and  who  should  now  turn 
up there  but the  terrible  'COLONEL  Bernstein'? From  a private letter 
to Weber  it transpires that  'COLONEL  Willich'  is in  command  of a 
corps from Cincinnati.  He  would  not  appear  to have gone into 
action  yet. 
On studying these American affairs more closely,  I have come  to 
the conclusion that  the  conflict between South  and  North—for  50 
years  the  latter  has  been climbing down, making  one  concession 
after another—has  at last been brought  to a  head  (if we  disregard 
the effrontery  of  'CHIVALRY'S'  fresh demands)  by the  weight which 
the extraordinary development of the  NORTH WESTERN STATES  has 
thrown into  the  scales.  The  population there, with  its  rich 
admixture  of  newly-arrived Germans  and  Englishmen  and, 
moreover, largely made up of  SELF-WORKING  FARMERS,  did not, of 
course, lend itself  so  readily  to intimidation  as the  GENTLEMEN  of 
Wall Street  and the  Quakers  of  Boston. According  to the  last 
census (1860),  it had  grown  by 67 p. c.  between  1850  and  1860,  in 

=====第337页=====
177. Marx  to Engels.  1 July  1861 301 
which year  it numbered 7,870,869, whereas, according  to the  same 
census,  the  entire free population  of the  seceded  SLAVE  STATES  was 
ABOUT  5 million. These  NORTH  WESTERN  STATES  lurnished  not  only  the 
BULK of the  ruling party,  but  also  the  President3  in I860.330  It was 
also this self-same area  in the  North that first came  out 
unequivocally against  any  recognition  of the  independence  of a 
SOUTHERN  CONFEDERACY. They cannot,  of course, allow  the  lower 
reaches  and  estuary  of the  Mississippi  to pass into  the  hands  of 
foreign states. Again,  in the  Kansas affair3 (from which this  war 
really dates),  it was the  population  of these NORTH WESTERN [States] 
who came  to blows with  the  BORDER  RUFFIANS. 
A closer look  at the  history  of the  secession movement reveals 
that secession, constitution (Montgomery), Congress ibid.,  etc., are 
USURPATIONS 286 without exception. Nowhere  did  they allow  the 
people  en masse  to vote. This  'USURPATION'—which  is concerned,  not 
only with secession from  the  North,  but  also with consolidating 
and intensifying the oligarchy of the 300,000  SLAVE LORDS  in the 
South vis-à-vis  the 5  million  WHITES—has  been  the  subject  of highly 
characteristic articles which appeared  in the  Southern PAPERS  at the 
time. b 
And now let us  turn  to high politics— Kinkel  and the  National 
Association  in London. 0 You  will no doubt recall that,  a week  ago 
last Saturday, Heintzmann  had  adjourned  the  meeting  (a fact he 
advertised  in the  Hermann4 ), because Juch  had  been sent  to 
Coburg, THERE TO MOVE  A placitum patrum. c At the  same time,  the 
GREAT  Heintzmann  had  convened  an extraordinary meeting  for 
Tuesday'  to commemorate  the  Battle  of Waterloo,332  etc. 
Foxy Gottfried, however, together with Zerffi, sent  out  secret 
circulars  to their people  (see  last Hermann) summoning them  to a 
meeting  on Saturday.8 Gottfried  and his  people, having  now got 
the field  to themselves, effectively held their meeting behind  the 
backs  of the  others. Gottfried  (as one of the  vice-presidents  of the 
National Association) took  the  chair,  and  Zerffi  (as a  member'  oi 
the committee  of the  self-same National Association) acted  as 
secretary.  It goes without saying that  the  resolutions pertaining  tc 
the MacDonald business,318  etc.,  that were adopted  at this meeting 
were agreeable  to Gottfried  and  Zerffi.  Now, on the  following

Tuesday, Heintzmann called for a reading of the minutes of the 
last meeting at which he had taken the chair, and acted as though 
he knew nothing whatever about the interim meeting held by 
Gottfried and Co. Nor did Gottfried and Zerffi, who were present, 
call for the reading of the relevant minutes or, for that matter, 
say a single word about the meeting they themselves had 
arranged. What Gottfried did do, however, was to write to Juch 
the following day, requesting him to reproduce in the Hermann 
the minutes of his, Gottfried's, meeting enclosed in his letter. He 
even ominously invoked an agreement which he had made with 
Juch on handing over the Hermann. The latter, however, said 
'quod non' 3 (see last Hermann). The day before yesterday, b 
it would seem, the row was discussed at a meeting of the Natio­
nal Association at Seyd's Hotel. But I haven't had a report on it 
yet. 
This will give you some idea of what the 'Machiavellismus 
Gottofredi Magni"7 is like. You will further see from the last 
Hermann's account of the meeting of the National Associationd 
that Blind—who has as many little dodges up his sleeve as there 
are fleas on a dog—invited 'Dralle' e to join, in order to secure for 
himself a vote of thanks as the saviour of Schleswig-Holstein/ This 
was, however, CAPPED  BY Heintzmann, who didn't even give Dralle's 
NOTION a chance to be put to the vote. This same summus g Blind got 
a third party to ask Weber, etc., whether he should 'appear as 
a speaker' at the MEETING to be held by the German commu­
nist association and the Frenchmen's associations in honour 
of the June insurrection.333 Reply: If he wanted a drubbing—

ENGELS TO MARX 249 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 3 July 1861 
Dear Moor, 
Your questions about the state of affairs in Virginia are easier 
put than answered. Is Washington still threatened? Not im­
mediately, otherwise the SOUTHERNERS would not have eyacuated so 
much territory; but one doesn't know, of course, how the 
opposing sides compare in terms of strength. Should the first 
major attack by the Northerners be decisively repulsed, it's 
impossible to say what might happen, for there is no knowing 
where they would come to a halt again. However, the chances are 
three to one that, even in that case, the Potomac would form an 
adequate obstacle. 
The position at Manassas JUNCTION is determined by the 
SOUTHERNERS' need to maintain communications with North-West 
Virginia along the railway to Paris and Strasburg. If M. J. is lost, 
their nearest railway communication with West Virginia (on the 
far side of the mountains) would be the line from Richmond via 
Gordonsville to Staunton—80 miles to the south; they would lose 
the opportunity of rapidly moving their reserves, particularly 
those immediately to the rear of their dispositions, from west to 
east, etc., as need arose, while any elements in West Virginia could 
be cut off or forced to make a wide detour. Such is the

304 178. Engels to Marx. 3 July 1861 
significance of the position—whether it has any tactical impor­
tance I can't say, for no conclusions at all can be drawn from the 
maps.  All in all, the war in West Virginia will now turn on the 
railway junctions. 
The affair at Big Bethel328 is of no significance. Tactically 
speaking, it was abominably MISMANAGED; a night attack carried out 
with volunteers like these and, what's more, with each column 
separated from the rest, could only end in confusion, mutual 
slaughter, and panicky flight. 
On the other hand, the North would seem to be at fault in 2 
respects: 1. the massive strength of the newly formed and fully 
mobile corps doesn't appear to have been called on at all; they were 
kept kicking their heels some 400-500 miles from the scene of the 
fighting, whereas on the Potomac they would have been worth 
their weight in gold, and 2.  BRAVE  OLD Scott would again appear to 
have made colossal plans for an encirclement334 which can only 
lead to a colossal dispersal of his troops; to what extent this may 
lead to defeats, given the slack ways and unknown heroes of the 
South, it is impossible to determine. 
What is this about not voting on secession?" According to all the 
papers up here, the resolutions at the conventions were ratified in 
each state by popular vote.

Goffredo il Magnanimo h subsequently got on in the affair.

MARX TO ENGELS 249 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 5 July 1861 
Dear Engels, 
Your letter enclosing £5 most gratefully received. 
For the past 3 days I have had a foul inflammation of the eyes 
which has prevented me from doing any writing or reading. 
However, I believe it will pass in a couple of days. 
Lupus found Alberts extremely obstructive. (I would mention in 
passing that the latter is Bernstorff's factotum. Also chief police 
agent and chief pimp to the more select visitors from Prussia.) 
However, with his own particular brand of rudeness, he finally 
browbeat Alberts into entering a long scrawl on his Swiss passport 
to the effect that Lupus,- an exile, was availing himself of the 
amnesty, etc., to travel to Wiesbaden, etc., for such and such a 
purpose. Initially, he had been told that, because of his 10 years' 
residence abroad—so this is the story they dish out to everyone— 
he had lost his Prussian citizenship. He should therefore have 
himself naturalised as an Englishman and travel on an English 
passport. 
Zedlitz,  BY THE  BY, told Lassalle shortly before his resignation that 
I had republican or, at least, anti-royalist views, and it was their 
unvarying principle never to renaturalise anyone of that couleur. 
They didn't want to set a praecedens in my CASE. 292 Winter, Zedlitz's 
successor, told Lassalle he could not reverse his predecessor's 
decision. Finally Schwerin, who was also being pestered by Lassalle 
and wanted to be rid of him, said he would refer the matter to the 
Berlin municipal council—which, however, he won't do. During the 
debate in the Chamber on the subject of refugees, Vincke et cie 
applauded loudly when Schwerin announced that the government 
would always reserve the right to decide each particular case as it 
thought fit. 336 
As to the secession business, the matter has been quite wrongly 
represented in the English papers.3 Everywhere, with the excep­
tion of South Carolina, there was the strongest opposition to 
secession.

First:  BORDER  SLAVE  STATES?  A CONVENTION  of the  BORDER  STATES  was 
held in the  winter  of  1861. 337 Those invited were Virginia, 
Kentucky, Arkansas, Maryland, Delaware, Tennessee  and  North 
Carolina.  For  this purpose, further  CONVENTIONS  were held  in each 
of the  above states  so  that  DELEGATES  might  be  sent  to the  GENERAL 
CONVENTION. 
Delaware refused even  to call a convention  for  this purpose. 
Tennessee ditto.  Its  Democratic  LEGISLATURE  took  it out of the 
Union  by  coup de  main. Admittedly,  an  ELECTION  was later  HELD  to 
ratify this  INVALID ACT.  This took place under A  REIGN OF TERRORISM. 
More than  l/3 didn't vote  at all. Of  the,remainder,  '/a  were against 
secession, including  the  whole  of  East Tennessee, which  at this 
moment  is arming  to oppose  the  secessionists. 
Kentucky. 100,000  for the  UNION TICKET,  only  a few  thousand  for 
secession. 
Maryland declared itself  in favour  of Union, and has now elected 
6 U  NION  MEN  aS  MEMBERS  OF  CoNGRESS.  ' 
North Carolina  and  even Arkansas elected  UNION DELEGATES,  the 
former actually  by a  large majority. Subsequently terrorised. 
Virginia.  The  people elected  a UNION CONVENTION  (by a majority). 
Some  of these chaps allowed themselves  to be  bought. When  the 
Southern fever was  at its  height—fall  of Sumter280—an  ORDINANCE 
OF SECESSION  was  PASSED  SECRETLY  BY 88 TO  55. All other moves—while 
the ORDINANCE  continued  to be  kept secret—aimed  at the  CAPTURE  of 
the FEDERAL  NAVY  YARD  AT NORFOLK  and the  FEDERAL  ARMORY  AT HARPERS 
FERRY  were carried  out  secretly. Were betrayed  to the  FEDERAL 
AUTHORITIES  before their  EXECUTION.  An  alliance with Jefferson Davis' 
GOVERNMENT  was concluded  in secret, and  a huge mass  of CONFEDERATE 
TROOPS  was suddenly pitched into  the  territory. Under their 
protection (truly Bonapartist, this),  it now  voted  for  secession. 
50,000  UNION  VOTES  nevertheless,  despite  the  SYSTEMATIC  TERRORISM.  AS 
you know,  NORTH  WESTERN  VIRGINIA  has now  publicly  broken  with  the 
secessionists. 
Second:  GULF STATES.339  A  popular vote proper was taken only  in a 
few states.  In most  of them,  the  conventions, which were chosen  to 
decide  the  attitude  of the  southern states  to  Lincoln's election 
(subsequently,  at the  Montgomery Congress,28fa  it was  they who 
formed  the  DELEGATES),  usurped  the  power  not  only  to decide  on 
secession  but  also to recognise  the  Constitution, Jefferson Davis, 
etc. How this actually came about you will learn from  the  extracts 
below, taken from Southern American papers.

Texas, where, after South Carolina, there  is the  largest  SLAVE PARTY 
and  TERRORISM,  nevertheless 11,000 votes  for  Union. 
Alabama.  No  popular vote either  on  secession  or on the new 
Constitution, etc. The convention elected here  PASSED  the  ORDINANCE 
OF SECESSION  by 61 votes to 39. The 39 were from the  NORTHERN 
COUNTIES,  peopled almost exclusively  by  whites,  but  they rep­
resented more  FREE MEN  than  the 61; for, in  accordance with  the 
UNITED  STATES CONSTITUTION,  each slave-holder also votes for 3/5 of his 
slaves. 
Louisiana. More  UNION  VOTES  than  SECESSION VOTES  were cast at the 
election  for  delegates  to the  convention.  But the  DELEGATES  defected. 
The interests  of the  mountain districts,  the  west  of Carolina,  the 
east of Tennessee,  the  north  of Alabama  and  Georgia,  are  very 
different from those  of the  southern  SWAMPS. 
The 2nd  Decembrist nature340  of all  this manoeuvring  for 
secession (which  is also  why  the  fellows were compelled  to provoke 
a war so that with the cry  'THE  NORTH  AGAINST  THE SOUTH'  they could 
keep  the  movement going), which will  be  apparent  to you  from 
the following excerpts,  is also evident from  the  fact that  the 
traitors  in Buchanan's administration  who  were  at the  head  of the 
movement—War Secretary Floyd, Navy Secretary Toucey, Treas­
ury Secretary Cobb, Secretary  of the  Interior Thompson  — 
together with  the  leading senators  of the  South, were deeply 
involved  in the  DILAPIDATIONS  running  to many millions which,  in the 
course  of December  1860,  had  been referred  by  Congress (House 
of Representatives) to a COMMUTÉE  of ENQUIRY.  For some of these 
fellows,  it was,  at least,  a question  of escaping  the  penitentiary. 
Hence they  are the  most willing tools  of the  300,000-strong 
SLAVEHOLDERS  oligarchy.  It goes without saying that  the  concentra­
tion, status,  and  resources  of the  latter enable  it TO PUT DOWN  any 
opposition  for the  time being. Among  one  section  of the  'POOR 
WHITES',  they found  the  MOB  that served them  in place  of Zouaves. 341 
Georgia.  'The  Griffin Union'3: 
'It is mere mockery  for the  same  men who  made  the  Constitution  in 
Montgomery  to come back  to Georgia  and  ratify  it under  the  name  of a  state

falling  off of  nearly 3,000,  and an  absolute majority  of elected deputies  of 79. But, 
upon assembling,  by wheedling, coaxing, buying,  and all the  arts of deception,  the 
convention showed  a majority  of 31' (against Union). '...The Georgia Convention  and

any such purpose.' 
The North  Alabamian: 
'The Convention made haste  to  usurp  the  prerogative,  and  ratify  the 
Constitution...  It is a  remarkable fact that  the  substantial, physical force  of the 
country,  the  hardfisted, handworking  men,  expected  to do all the  fighting when

'In Alabama a majority of the popular vote was cast against going out, but a 
small majority of the delegates were for secession, they took Alabama out, and 
refused the people to have any voice in the matter. The vote of Louisiana, too, was

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 12 July 1861 
Dear Engels, 
Your last letter232 together with enclosure, or rather the enclosure 
minus letter, most gratefully received. 
The grand tragi-comedy of Gottfried Kinkel has come to a 
worthy end, and POOR Gottfried has been knocked on the head. 
To put the grand goings-on into a nutshell, what actually 
happened was this: On 15 June, Gottfried and Co., as I have 
already related," had, off their own bat, held a special meeting, 
at which they passed resolutions agreeable to themselves. On 
18 June, Heintzmann took the chair at an extraordinary meeting, 
whose agenda did not include the great point at issue, since they 
were still awaiting a reply from Coburg. 
The crucial meeting finally took place on 6 July, an answer 
HAVING MEANWHILE ARRIVED from the oracle at Coburg. 343 Both parties 
were there in force, including the 35 members of the Association 
of German Men D bought by Gottfried for cash. However, before 
the day of the meeting there had already been a considerable 
See this volume, pp. 301-02.

310 180. Marx to Engels. 12 July 1861 
amount of agitation. For instance, the Association of German Men 
had been harangued by Heinztmann et cie and told about 
Gottfried's machinations. The chairman of that association, a SHIP 
AGENT  by the name of Schmidt (a Hanoverian), went over to the 
'patriotic' side, of course, 
Heintzmann—BY  THE  BY—has,  of course, a twofold interest in 
view: on the one hand, to appear pleasing to the Prussian 
government, on the other, perhaps to obtain hac via* from that 
government some important TRUSTIVE office connected with the 
forthcoming industrial exhibition. 344 From what I hear, the fellow 
has performed the office of chairman after the true heavy-handed 
fashion of your Royal Prussian Elberfeld prosecutor. Not that this 
isn't the right way to handle the melodramatic Gottfried. 
Well then, after the meeting (on 6 July) had been declared 
open, Heintzmann called for the reading of the minutes of 1 and 
18 June. Neither Kinkel nor Zerffi dared so much as suggest that 
their minutes of the 15th should be read. Thus, they admit the 
illegality of the meeting secretly organised by themselves. Next, 
Heintzmann read out the letter from Coburg. The oracle over 
there had written as follows: While expulsion from the National 
Association could, of course, only be effected by the senate at 
Coburg, expulsion from the comité (as in Zerffi's case) was a local 
matter and hence must be decided in London. 
Now, it so happened that the election of new officials to the 
London National Association was in general due to take place on 
6 July. Hence, when Schmidt moved that they proceed with the 
agenda and allow the elections to decide the case, his motion was 
carried. 
Gottfried made a very long speech and generally conducted 
himself in a melodramatically excited manner. The few hairs he 
still possesses stood on end. He was by turns acrimonious and 
threatening and even, at times, had recourse to irony, a field that 
is quite foreign to him. Throughout his speech, the utmost 
disorder reigned. Hissing. Notably, too, reiterated shouts of 
'Gottfried', which he always regards as a grievous outrage. But 
oddest of all, it seems, was the manner in which, during the 
succeeding debate, even though he no longer had the floor, 
Gottfried kept leaping to his feet in order to interrupt, whereupon 
Heintzmann, raising a menacing arm, caused him by a mere 
gesture- to subside into his seat. 
a thereby

181. Marx to Antoinette Philips. 17 July 1861 311 
At the elections Gottfried and his whole gang were thoroughly 
trounced. Heintzmann was elected chairman by 133 votes to 
Gottfried's 5. So, even the fellows he had suborned voted for the 
most part against him. No sooner had these results been 
proclaimed than he apparently adopted a most 'dignified' pose, a 
synthesis of the 'dying gladiator' and 'Christ crucified'. Has 
Gottfried deserved this of 'his beloved Germany'? 
In the meantime, however, that creature Blind—who, as a 
'republican', does not.of course,belong to the National Association-
had succeeded by dint of obsequiousness, sharp practice, and 
intrigues of all kinds in having himself loudly acclaimed as the 
courageous and patriotic champion of Schleswig-Holstein at both 
the National Association meetings of 15 and 18 June. 3

heavy pressure of business, and during the last 2 or 3 weeks I 
laboured under a most disgusting inflammation of the eyes which 
very much limited the time I had disposable for writing or 
reading. So, my dear child, if I must plead guilty, there are many 
attenuating circumstances which I trust you, as a gracious judge, 
will allow to influence your sentence. At all events, you would do 
me great wrong in supposing that during all that time one single 
day had passed away without the remembrance, on my part, of my 
dear little friend. 
My Berlin affair has not yet been brought to a definite issue. 
You will remember that during my stay in the Prussian metropolis 
the Hohenzollern authorities seemed to yield, and even furnished 
me with a passport for one year. Yet hardly had I turned my back 
upon them, when Lassalle, to his utter astonishment, received a 
letter from the Polizeipräsident v. Zedlitz to the purpose that I 
could not be 'renaturalised' because of my 'politische  Bescholtenheit'.* 
At the same time the Prussian government declared that all the 
Political Refugees, having been absent from Prussia for more than 
10 years, had lost their right of citizenship, had become 
foreigners, and would, consequently, like all other foreigners, only 
be re-naturalised at the pleasure of the king. In other words, they 
declared their so-called amnesty 1' to be a mere delusion, sham and 
share. This was a point I had tried to drive them to during my 
Berlin stay, and it was more than even the Prussian press and the 
Prussian chamber of deputies were able to bear silently with. 
Consequently, the case gave rise to bitter discussions in the 
journals, and to an interpellation of the cabinet in the Abgeord-
netenhaus.c  For the nonce the ministry escaped by means of some 
equivocous and contradictory statements, but the whole affair 
contributed not a little to disillusion people in Germany as to the 
'new era' inaugurated by what the Berliners irreverently call the 
'Schöne Wilhelm'/ 345 Lassalle, with his usual stubbornness, tried 
hard to get the better of the authorities. First he rushed to Zedlitz 
and made him such a scene that the Freiherr e got quite frightened 
and called his secretary for assistance. A few weeks later, Zedlitz 
having been removed from his post, in consequence of hostile 
demonstrations against him by the Berlin mob, Lassalle called 
upon Geheimrath' Winter, the successor of Zedlitz, but the 
"successor' declared that his hands were bound by the decision of 
a political unreliability - b See this volume, pp. 248-49. - c Chamber of Deputies -

his 'predecessor'. Lassalle, lastly, caught hold of Count Schwerin, 
the minister of the Interior who, to escape from the violent 
expostulations of my representative, promised him to leave the 
whole case to the decision of the Berlin magistrate—a promise he 
is, however, not very likely to keep. 336 As to  myself,  I have attained 
at least the one success of forcing the Berlin government to throw 
off its liberal mask. As to my return to Berlin, if I should think 
proper to go there before May 1862, they could not prevent it 
because of the passport granted to me. If I should delay my 
return, things will perhaps have so altered in Prussia, that I shall 
not want their permission. It is really ridiculous that a government 
should make so much fuss, and compromise itself so much, for 
fear of a private individual. The conscience of their weakness must 
be awful. 
At the same time I had the good fortune of being honoured by 
the singular attention of the French government. A person at 
Paris whom I do not know, had a translation of my pamphlet Herr 
Vogt already in print, when an order on the part of M. de 
Persigny forbade him going on with the translation. At the same 
time a general warning was communicated to all the booksellers at 
Paris against selling the German original of Herr Vogt. I got only 
acquainted with this occurrence by a Paris correspondence 
published in the Allgemeine Augsburger Zeitung." 
From the Gräfin Hatzfeldt I have received a letter filling 16 
pages. b Take an example of this, my dear child. She has gone—of 
course, in company of Lassalle —to a bathing place near Frankfurt 
on the Main. Thence they will proceed to Switzerland, and, after a 
month's sojourn there, to Italy. She feels much ennuyée 1 and thinks 
herself much to be pitied, because she has no other business on 
hand save that of amusing  herself.  It is in fact a bad plight for an 
active, stirring and rather ambitious woman whose days of 
flirtation are gone by. 
A propos. I have sent from Manchester to August d the two 
volumes of Lassalle's new juridical worke and should like to hear 
whether the packet has found out its address. From Jacques' I 
have heard nothing.

Dear Engels, 
I do not believe that you can apply to the Prussian Embassy in 
London for a 'certificate of good conduct'347 without presenting 
the fellows with a document most compromising to  yourself.

Embassy a supervisory body obliged to issue testimonia as to the

conduct of foreigners or Prussians. Only insofar as it issues 
passports does it have to consider whether someone's reputation, 
either as a result of a court decision or by rumor publicus, is that of 
a .criminal. As for the rest, it is  SUPPOSED  TO KNOW  NOTHING about private 
INDIVIDUALS. What it does know, it knows per abusum* as a 
moucharderieh institution. Thus, a certificate of good conduct from 
that quarter would be tantamount to a certificate of good conduct 
from the illegal (and hence officially non-existent) secret political 
police, sub auspiciis' of Alberts, the Embassy clerk. But you cannot 
recognise such an -authority, and the chief of police in Barmen 
would be very hard put to it, were you to ask him to indicate the 
paragraph in the Prussian statute book according to which the 
Prussian Embassy in London possesses such attributes. 
The same cannot be said of the Prussian consul in Manchester. 
Consuls are commercial, not political representatives of their state. 
Hence they are SUPPOSED to know the businessmen of their locality 
and, in particular, those of their own nationality. Hence the consul 
would be able to give a certificate to the effect that X. X. has lived 
in Manchester for 10 years as a respectable businessman and is 
known to be such. The Prussian government has no right 
whatever to demand any other kind of testimonial and would be 
too cautious to do so officially. But the former it can demand, 
because your request for renaturalisation has put you on the same 
footing as FOREIGNERS of whom suchlike testimonials, etc., may be 
required when they apply for naturalisation in Prussia. 
The Prussian government has no more right to demand any sort 
of testimonial concerning your political conduct than, say, a 
confession of political faith executed by you  yourself.

strange attempt at assassination346 (it's not clear from the 
newspapers whether he's a Russian or a German) will greatly 
contribute to a frightful termination of the 'new era'.345 
I have read the 2nd part of your work" (when I wanted to 
begin on the first, I was prevented by my eye-trouble) and have 
derived very great pleasure from it. I began with No. II because 
the subject was more congenial to me; not that this will prevent 
me from subsequently considering the thing in its totality. 
You have misconstrued to some extent the very brief comments 
in my previous letterb —no doubt it was the way I put it that was 
to blame. D'abord, by 'testamentary  freedom' I didn't mean freedom 
to make a will, but freedom to make it with complete disregard for 
one's family. In England, the will as such goes back a very long 
way, nor can there be the slightest doubt that the Anglo-Saxons 
adopted it from Roman jurisprudence. That the English, even at a 
very early date, considered testacy rather than intestacy to be the 
norm, is evident from the fact that as far back as the Late Middle 
Ages,  if a pater familias died ab intestatof only the obligatory 
portions went to his wife and children, according to circumstances, 
whereas V3 or V2 fell to the Church. For the priests assumed that, 
had he made his will, he would for the salvation of his soul have 
left a certain amount to the Church. Generally, it seems to be in 
this sense that wills in the Middle Ages had a religious connotation 
and were made for the benefit of the deceased rather than the 
survivors. But the point I was trying to make (I am not, of course, 
concerned here with feud il property) was that, after the revolu­
tion of 1688, the restrictions governing family settlements, to 
which the testator had till then been legally subject, were lifted. 
That this was in keeping with the system of free competition and 
the society based thereon cannot seriously be questioned; nor that 
Roman law, modified to a greater or lesser extent, was adopted by 
modern society because the legal idea that the subject of free 
competition has of himself corresponds to that of the Roman 
person (not that I have any intention of enlarging at this juncture 
on what is a most important point, namely that the legal 
representation of certain property relations, though undoubtedly 
deriving from them, is not for all that, and cannot be, congruent 
with them). 
You have shown that the adoption of the Roman will originally 
rested on a misconception (and still does, so far as the sagacity of

learned jurists is concerned). But it by no means follows from this 
that the will in its modern form—no matter with what misconcep­
tions of Roman law modern jurists may construe it—is the 
misconceived Roman will. If this were so, it might be said that every 
attainment of an earlier age adopted by a later one is a 
misunderstanding of the past. It is certain, for instance, that the 3 
unities, as theoretically construed by the French dramatists349 in 
Louis XIV's day, rest on a misconception of Greek drama (and of 
Aristotle as the exponent thereof). On the other hand, it is equally 
certain that they understood the Greeks in a way that corre­
sponded exactly to their own artistic needs. Hence their continued 
adherence to this so-called 'classical' drama long after Dacier and 
others had provided them with a correct interpretation of 
Aristotle. It is also certain that all modern constitutions are largely 
based on a misconception of the English constitution, adopting as-
essential precisely that which appears to be declining in the 
English constitution—and which continues to exist in England in 
name only per abusum*—e.g. a so-called responsible cabinet. The 
misunderstood form is precisely the general one. It is the one that 
lends itself to general  USE at a certain stage in the development of 
society. 
Whether, for example, the English would or would not have 
had the form of will they now have (which, although it derives 
directly from the Roman and corresponds to Roman forms is not 
the Roman) without Rome is, to my mind, neither here nor there. 
Now, let me put the question another way, e.g.: Might not legacies 
(and under the so-called will of today the chief beneficiary 
becomes, in fact, merely a universal legatee350) have arisen of 
themselves out of bourgeois society, even without any reference to 
Rome? Or, in place of legacies, just written instructions on the 
part of the defunctib as to the disposal of their assets? 
What still seems to me not proven is that the Greek will was 
imported by Rome, although diere would admittedly seem to be 
every probability that this is so. 
You will have seen that Blanqui's sentence—one of the most 
outrageous that have ever been pronounced—has been confirmed 
in the court of appeal.293 I am now curious to see what his friend in 
Brusselsr will have to tell me.

This is to inform you in much haste that the £5 has been most

An odious little sheet was sent to me yesterday entitled 
Thusneldah —by Kinkel and Zerffi, attacking Heintzmann et cie. 
Rarely have I encountered such abysmally stupid juvenilia. 
The worthy Heinrich Bürgers has made a pro-National Associa­

Gotha.' 
Handsome William appears to be completely out of his mind. 
The fool is studying folio volumes on the coronation of Fred­

My sweet little Cousin, 
You must excuse me for sending you today only a few lines. 
The fact is that I reserve to myself the pleasure of addressing you 
a real letter' in a few days. For the present, I wish only to learn, 
by your gracious interference, whether August" has at last 
received Lassalle's work!1  Lassalle bothers me with a new letter as to this 
subject, he considering of course 'his work' as something awfully 
important. He presses me to answer him by next post, and thus I 
must again call upon you. You will much oblige me by informing 
me as soon as possible of the real state of the case. 
Apropos. The book was to be sent to August from Manchester, 
not from London, but I have been assured that it had been sent 
from Manchester to Amsterdam. Of course, I don't care a fig for 
the whole 'loss', if loss there be, since August would certainly not 
much miss 'the work'. But courtesy obliges me to make these 
researches. 
In writing me, you will be of course so friendly to inform me at 
the same time of what you are doing arid so forth, knowing my 
deep interests in all that concerns you. 
My best compliments to your father and the whole family. 
Believe me always your most sincere admirer

DEAR  Frederick, 
Our youngest3 has had jaundice ever since I got back352; her 
condition had been unsatisfactory long before that. Yesterday the 
yellowness was gone from her eyes, and there is every indication 
that she is on the mend. 
I sent one article to the Tribune the week before last and one 
this week.b In two weeks' time we shall know (meanwhile I am 
continuing with one article per week) whether things can go on in 
this way. 
The Vienna 'Presse', or so I gather from what the Times 
CORRESPONDENT  wrote yesterday,' has finally revised its attitude 
towards Schmerling and hence it may now be possible to establish 
a connection with the paper. 
In the issue of Kolatschek's Stimmen der Zeit that arrives in 
London this Monday (or so Kolatschek has written and told 
Borkheim) there is a special supplement on Herr Vogt. A 
Very many thanks for the Manchester Guardians (most useful to 
me just now) and the BRITISH ASSOCIATION PUBLICATION.333 
At the beginning of this week, a young officer by the name of 
E. Oswald—dressed in Garibaldi OFFICER  UNIFORM—called  here with 
an introduction from Schily. A former Prussian lieutenant, he 
joined Garibaldi as a volunteer, and was promoted lieutenant 
under Medici. After the disbandment of Garibaldi's army, he went 
to Paris, where he took employment as a worker, in a factory to 
make ends meet. He is now over here and intends to go to 
America to join in the struggle. What he needs are funds to get 
him there. A sailing vessel leaves here every week for New York, 
and the fare is only £6. Borkheim is prepared to put up £5 on his 
own account and that of one or two acquaintances. So it's up to a 
few liberal philistines (Borchardt, etc.) in Manchester to raise a 
further small sum, partly to provide the passage money. The £6,

however, does not include food. Borkheim turned  d'abord*  to 
Kinkel with a view to obtaining Oswald's travelling expenses from 
the revolutionary funds. 81 But Gottfried said: quod non.b  (When in 
Zurich, Borkheim had succeeded by this means in procuring the 
money for Anneke's passage to America.) Nor will the American 
Embassy give a single FARTHING. Oswald seems to me to be an 
excellent young man and entirely unassuming into the bargain. 
Once he got to New York, a recommendation from me to Dana 
would be very useful to him. However, something must be done 
about it quickly, for his stay in London simply means faux frais de 
production? 
Oswald says that, as a soldier, Türr isn't worth twopence either. 
A mere intriguer. Garibaldi kept him on, primarily because he had 
been recommended by an Italian friend of Garibaldi's, previously 
associated with Türr, but more especially by virtue of his function 
as the 'REPRESENTATIVE OF HUNGARY'. Whenever Garibaldi employed 
him in any kind of independent military role, he was dissatisfied 
with him. Rüstow, too, evidently took little or no part in the affair. 
Officially his duty was that of 'historiographer' of the war. Oswald 
says of Garibaldi that he is essentially a guerrilla leader, but would 
be unable to cope with a larger army on a larger terrain. His 
strategical advisers are Cosenz and Medici.

[London,] 30 October 1861 
Dear Engels, 
Circumstances have finally CLEARED to the extent that I have at 
least got firm ground under my feet again and am no longer in a 
state of complete suspense. As you know, shortly after my return 
from Manchester352 and as soon as I thought the moment 
opportune, I again started writing for the Tribune at weekly 
intervals. Last week included, I had sent them 6 articles.355 Then, 
in the last mail, the first 2 articles" actually came back in print, the 
first of them (over 3 columns on English opinions on the UNITED 
STATES) in a PROMINENT PLACE and particularly  REFERRED  TO on the front 
page of the paper. To this extent, then, the matter is in order and 
hence I am assured of £2 per week. 
Secondly: I had, as you know, already written to the Vienna 
Presse from Manchester, asking for 'information'. 35'1 About 3 weeks 
ago I got an answer which was politically entirely satisfactory to 
me. (In the meantime, the paper has modified its attitude to 
Schmerling.) At the same time, Friedländer (on behalf of Zang, 
the proprietor) asked for 2 sample articles. These b I sent off and 
yesterday morning I got an answer to the effect 1. that the articles 
had appeared with due prominence on the front page,357 2. that I 
was engaged on a regular basis from November, £1 per article, 
lOsh. per news-letter. 
As regards the Tribune, I must first of all find some way of 
drawing bills, for it can hardly be arranged through Freiligrath in 
future. 
For the rest, this twofold engagement holds out an assured 
prospect of putting an end to the harried existence led by my 
family over the past year, and also of finally completing my 
book.310 Thanks to you, I was able to placate the more pressing of 
the blackguards at the beginning of September, but even so, the

harassment was still quite intolerable, and in October it again 
reached a crescendo. I am writing today to my old lady" to find 
out whether anything can be squeezed out of her. I shall likewise 
see if I can raise something from a LOAN SOCIETY. My chief concern, 
of course, is to put my affairs into some sort of order, pending the 
availability of amounts WORTH DRAWING from New York and Vienna, 
and above all to have leisure in which to work during the interval 
that must necessarily elapse. In the MEAN TIME, we have pawned 
everything that was not actually nailed down and, what is even 
worse, my wife is seriously unwell. When it was simply a case of 
enduring the pressure of day-to-day adversities, she did this 
bravely, but she has been cast down by the complete absence of 
prospects. In the meantime, the favourable news from Vienna and 
New York has already evoked a favourable reaction. 
Borkheim had strangely misled both himself and me over 
Kolatschek's Stimmen der Zeit. True, No. 39 carried a contribution 
running to a printer's sheet headlined 'K. Vogt und K. Marx', but 
it was written by the student Abt, the 'lowest of the low', whom 
you will remember from Geneva. Having taken due note of the 
actual content of my pamphlet b in the first 2 pages, he devotes the 
remaining 14 to railing in the most rabid and villainous fashion 
against me and, notably, Schily and Imandt, on account of the 
'Bristlers'. 338 He concludes by saying that, if I don't recant, he will 
attack me 'at the only vulnerable spot he knows' and compromise 
me in a manner 'that I shall regret'. Needless to say, I didn't take 
the slightest notice of the scoundrel. But something very odd must 
have happened to put Mr Kolatschek at Abt's mercy, for, as Abt 
says,  he had had the scrawl as far back as January and had 
refused to print it until September.

Dear Frederick, 
You must excuse  me for my  failure  to send  a more prompt 
acknowledgement  of the £5,  ditto  the  wine. Very many thanks  for 
both.  It so  happened that  I have been very busy  of late,  on top of 
which  I have  had a  great deal  of domestic  BOTHER. 
Once again,  the  Tribune's front page calls attention  to an  article 
of mine as  'MOST INTERESTING'.2  Odd the way these  YANKEES312  hand 
out testimonia to their own  CORRESPONDENTS. 
I had an  answer from  my old  ladyb yesterday. 'Soft' words,  BUT 
NO CASH.  She  also tells  me  what  I have long known, namely that  she 
is 75 and is  suffering from many  of the  infirmities  of old age. 
Up till  now I  have also been vainly trying  to raise  a LOAN  over

Dear Citizen, 
My reply to your last letters has been delayed for so long 
because I was waiting from day to day for news from a lady you 
know.a At last I have learned that she left for Italy some months 
ago but will shortly be returning to Berlin. 
If the first letter for L.b has not arrived, I imagine that the fault 
must lie in the address; it was marked via Gibraltar instead of via 
Southampton. After I had been advised of this mistake, I corrected 
the address on the second letter. This I not only franked but also 
registered. I enclose the receipt from the English post office. 
The 50 francs I am sending you comes from a German working 
men's club.c In my next letter I shall send you a further 
contribution. Please be so kind as to acknowledge receipt and send 
copies of your pamphlet363 in return. 
It would be useful if you were to write me a letter I could send 
to Berlin and which would establish the monetary resources 
needed for a <rescue attempt>.d I should return it to the 
appropriate quarter. 
Rest assured that there is no one more interested than myself in 
the lot of a mane whom I have always regarded as the brains and 
inspiration of the proletarian party in France. 
Salut.

[London,] 18 November [1861] 
Dear Engels, 
herum Crispinus!* 
Well, this is how matters now stand. 
On 9 November, I drew £16 on the Tribune for the 8 articles 
then sent. Out of this £16, I paid £3 apiece on account to butcher, 
baker, TEAGROCER, OILMAN, MILKMAN, and GREENGROCER. I spent 10/- on 
coal, which will all be gone by tomorrow. Your £5 went for the 
most part on the repayment of small cash loans. So, I'm broke, 
and there are further debts to be paid—the LANDLORD, school f ees, 
the cobbler, and essential purchases for the family against the 
winter. I write for the Presse almost every day. With the Presse and 
the Tribune combined I might be able to make SHIFT. But in view 
of the constantly reaccumulating deficit (not a. milliard, admitted­
ly364) and a whole year's loss of income this really can't be done. 
Now there has been yet another disaster. 
As you know, I advanced Petsch & Co. £25 for the printing of 
Vogt, it being agreed that this was to be repaid out of the SALE of 
COPIES,  before any other deductions. Moreover, they owe me a few 
pounds for Hinter den Coulissent the Communist Trial 1 and the 
18th Brumaire? etc. 247 
On the other hand, I obtained newspapers and books from the 
fellows to the value of £10 9/-, if only to be in possession of some 
security. 
Koller (an  associé*)  has now had a row with Petsch, who is not in 
the business at present. There's a lawsuit pending between the two 
over the firm's liquidation. 
The rascally Koller, whom I pressed about my claim, wrote 
instead advising me of his suit in the COUNTY-COURT  7 regarding the 
£10 9/-. I went to see Zimmermann. He told me that my suit

would cost me about £30-£60 in a  SUPERIOR COURT,  and that it would 
be better if I established my claim in the form of a counter-claim 
in the  COUNTY-COURT,  to which I had been summoned by Koller. Nor 
does he himself practise in the  COUNTY-COURTS. SO,  to this end, I shall 
have to see an English  SOLICITOR  before the week is out (and as soon 
as possible), which I can't do without  CASH. 
If I were quit of this wretched situation and did not see my family 
oppressed by  MISERABLE  adversities, how overjoyed I would 
be at the fiasco of the Decembrist financial system, so long and so 
frequently prognosticated by me in the Tribune.

plain speaking in Silesia: 'If you elect democrats, we shall be 
ruined.' 'Soldiers are the only answer to democrats.'363

Dear Moor, 
Have the YANKEES gone quite out of their minds, playing such a 
mad trick on the CONFEDERATE  COMMISSIONERS?  366 The FACT that even 
over here in the Channel, a warship was lying in wait for the MAIL 
STEAMER  shows that general instructions had gone out from 
Washington. There could be no clearer casus  belli 11 than to forcibly 
seize political prisoners on board a foreign vessel. The fellows 
must be completely crazy to saddle themselves with a war 
against England. If war should really break out, you could send 
your letters to New York via Germany or Le Havre, under cover 
to a third party, but you'll have to take care that you're not aiding 
and abetting  the  ENEMIES  of the  QUEEN. b 
I was delighted to hear that Bakunin had bolted. The poor devil 
must have been very much the worse for wear. What a way to 
make a journey round the world!36' 
Monsieur Bonaparte would also seem to get no money and 
Fould pretty well at his wits' end.364 I can't help wondering what's 
going to happen there. 
Things are going swimmingly in Russia and Poland, and now 
there's also a chance that good old Prussia may at long last be 
involved in a crisis, provided the electors don't allow themselves to 
be intimidated again.368  But the purse, the purse! That may well 
serve to keep the few 'men of Progress' afloat a little while longer. In 
Cologne it is even rumoured that good old Heinrich Bürgers might 
stand for Parliament. 
Varnhagen's Tagebiicherc  must be quite interesting. All the same, 
the fellow was a scurvy, cowardly knave. There was quite a witty 
article about the thing in the Kreuz-Zeitung, —full of spite and 
malice, of course.' 1

Dear Moor, 
The above is the number of the enclosed fiver, which could not 
go off till today, as the first of December fell on a Sunday. Once 
again, I didn't register it. 
During the past few days I have at last read some of the 
Lassalle. a His stuff about retroaction may be quite plausible, but 
doesn't hold water, as is apparent, e.g., in the case of divorce 
legislation, of which it might also be said, and has in fact been said 
by many a Berlin philistine: 'If I'd known how difficult it was to 
get divorced, I should never have got married.' By the way, it's 
grossly superstitious of the fellow to go on believing in the 'idea of 
law', absolute law. His objections to Hegel's philosophy of law are 
for the most part perfectly justified, but he hasn't yet really got 
into his stride with his new philosophy of mind; even from the 
philosophical standpoint he should have progressed sufficiently to 
regard the process alone, not just its momentary result, as the 
absolute, in which case no other idea of law could follow than 
precisely the historical process  itself.  The style's nice, too. 'The 
hand-wringing despair of the contradictions', etc., and then the 
introduction. Pure Ephraim Artful. I dare say I shan't get very 
much further, unless I find it might come in useful as a course in 
Roman law, in which case I shall read the whole thing. How, 
a F. Lassalle, Das System der erworbenen Rechte.

by the way, one could think it worthwhile to send so simple and, 
au fond? insignificant an idea chasing right through the Corpus 
juris, 3,10 applying it to every single point—as though it would gain 
weight in the process—is quite beyond my comprehension. But 
even nicer is the assumption that this  WILD  GOOSE  CHASE,  conducted in 
and around the 'plenitude of the concrete', is the proof of his 
pudding and he must therefore remain infallible ever after. 
In Berlin things will now begin to hum. The new little 
Chamber's half-hearted 'progress' democracy371 will prove too red 
for handsome William, after all, and by March they'll already find 
themselves in a state of mild chronic crisis. I am curious to see 
what happens. If only the chaps in the Chamber aren't too timid, 
they will yet succeed in toppling the handsome one, but I don't 
trust that democratic breed. 
I hope your wife is feeling better. Cordial regards to her and 
the girls.

MARX TO ENGELS 372 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 9 December 1861 
Dear Engels, 
From my PERTINACIOUS silence you may discern with what 
reluctance I write to you at all. Considering the great efforts— 
greater, even, than you can manage—that you make on my 
behalf,  I need hardly say how much I detest perpetually boring 
you with my lamentations. 
The last money you sent me, plus a borrowed pound, went to 
pay the school  bill  — so that there shouldn't be twice the amount 
owing in January. The butcher and épicier" made me give them 
I.O.U.s, one for £10, the other for £12, due on 9 January. 
Although I didn't know with what I should pay them, I couldn't 
risk being sued lest I bring the whole house tumbling about my 
ears.  I owe the LANDLORD £15, and shall owe him £21 in January. 
Ditto the GREEN GROCER, the baker, the news agent, the milkman, and 
the rest c.f the rabble whom I had placated with payments on 
account after my return from Manchester, 352 lastly the TALLYMAN, 
since the onset of winter meant buying indispensable items of 
winter clothing, which therefore had to be got on tick. 
The amount I can expect at the end of the month is £30 at 
most, since those scoundrels from the Presse are not printing some 
of my articles. I have, of course, first to accustom myself to 
keeping within the 'bounds of German reason'. (Incidentally, 
though, they are making quite a splash in their paper with my 
contributions.) 
What I have to pay (including interest at the pawn-shop, etc.) 
amounts to £100. It is remarkable how, despite an occasional 
helping-hand, the loss of all income combined with debts that are 
never quite paid off invariably brings the same old muck to the 
surface again. 
Today I have written to Dronke because he still owes me some 
money. But just gently nudging his memory, not urging; I made so 
bold as to tell him that, if he could make me an advance, you would 
guarantee its repayment.373 
Once I'm out of this mess, New York and Vienna will allow me 
at least to jog along again.

My wife was in a dangerous nervous condition, and for a few 
days Dr Allen was most alarmed. He knows, or rather suspects, 
where the shoe pinches, but is too tactful to say anything 
untoward. The poor woman is still very out of sorts, but so 
resilient is she by nature that, as soon as things take a turn for the 
better, I feel sure she will be all right again. 
There isn't going to be war with America, as I have said from 
the very beginning in the  Presse, 3 and I am only sorry I didn't have 
the means to exploit the boneheadedness of a Stock Exchange 
dominated during this silly season by Reuter and The Times. 
I agree with your STRICTURES ON Izzyb (who writes from Florence 
to say he'has had a very interesting meeting' with Garibaldi, etc.). 
The 2nd volume is more interesting, if only by reason of the Latin 
quotations. Ideologism permeates everything, and the dialectical 
method is wrongly applied. Hegel never described as dialectics the 
subsumption of vast numbers of 'CASES' UNDER  A GENERAL PRINCIPLE. 
My writing is progressing, but slowly.310 Circumstances being 
what they were, there was, indeed, little possibility of bringing 
such theoretical matters to a rapid close. However, the thing is 
assuming a much more popular form, and the method is much 
less in evidence than in Part I.c

He is going  to try and  discount  the  bills.  I told  him at  once that

Dear Engels, 
You know  how the  Dronke business came about.c  I wrote  to 
him, not  because  of the  bill, but to dun him. In the  circumstances, 
I was, of  course, compelled  to inform  him of the  critical situation  I 
was in, a  situation which  he,  like anyone else, must,  and did,  find 
quite natural  in view  of the  American affair.  As a  result  of this 
communication,  he came  to see me and,  thus,  the  arrangement 
was made which,  to begin with,  I would never even have thought 
of, had you not  expressly stated  in your letter232 that  you  would 
accept  the  bills  if I was  able  to get  them discounted through

Freiligrath  or 'some other person'.  I say  this much  in order  to 
absolve myself  of any  semblance  of indiscretion. 
There  is nothing doing with  F., as I  already knew beforehand. 
He only  had the  tailor  and by the  time  of the  Tribune affair  he'd 
already lost  him,  because  two of his  clerks  had  obtained articles  of 
clothing  to the  value  of £70 on his  recommendation  and 
decamped without paying. Moreover,  my  RELATIONS  TO F. were  so 
CHANGED  that, when  he  arranged  to  have even  my  bills  on the 
Tribune discounted again  by  Bischoffsheim,  he did so  only with 
reluctance. But, even  if he had  wanted  to,  he couldn't particularly 
since  the  latent bankruptcy  of his  bank court  par  les rues de Londres? 
This letter will  go off at the  same time  as one to  Dronke, 
informing  him  that  I embarked  on the  TRANSACTIONS  with  him as a 
result  of a  misunderstanding  and  asking  him  therefore  to regard 
them  as non avenues. b I also told  him  that,  if he  could discount  the 
bills  on me  personally  WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION OF OTHER PERSONS,  this 
would  be  agreeable  to me.  I had to  tell him  that, because  I can see 
no way out, and  indeed  my  situation  is one of the  utmost peril. 
His address, letters  to be  marked private,  is 49  Oldhall Street, 
Liverpool. Judging  by  what Dronke says (though  I believe  he's in 
Newcastle  and not in  Liverpool  at all), he  would simply  try to 
arrange  the  matter with  his own  BANKER. 
Unfortunately,  I couldn't help informing  my  wife  of the 
contents  of your letter, insofar  as it  referred  to the  bill transaction. 
And news  of this kind always brings  on a  kind  of paroxysm. 
As to war  with America,  Pam may  possibly succeed  in bringing  it 
about,  but not  without difficulty.  He has got to  have  a PRETEXT  and 
it doesn't seem  to me as  though Lincoln will give  him one.  Some  of 
the Cabinet, Milner Gibson, Gladstone, plus  ou moins' Lewis, can't 
be so easily  BEFOOLED  as John Russell. 
Taken  by and  large,  the  Americans have  not  been  at fault, 
either materially  or.  formally, under English maritime  law,  which  is 
in force there.375  As  TO THE  QUESTION  OF MATERIAL RIGHT,  the  English 
CROWN LAWYERS  have themselves given  a decision along these lines.376 
They have therefore adduced, since  Pam  needed  a PRETEXT,  an 
ERROR  in forma, a  TECHNICALITY,  A LEGAL QUIBBLE.  But this, too, is 
erroneous. Under English maritime  law one  must distinguish 
between two cases. Whether  A NEUTRAL  SHIP  CARRIES  BELLIGERENT  GOODS  AND 
PERSONS  or  CONTRABAND  OF WAR,  either  in the  form  of  objects  or 
persons.  In the  latter case,  the  ship with  CARGO  and  persons  is TO BE 
SEIZED  AND BROUGHT  INTO  A PORT FOR ADJUDICATION.  In the first instance—if 
a is the  talk of London  - b null  and  void  - c more  or less 

=====第372页=====
336 197. Marx  to Engels.  19 December  1861 
it is established beyond doubt that  the  GOODS  (properly speaking  an 
impossibility  in the  case  of  persons) have  not  passed into  the 
possession of a neutral, the  BELLIGERENT  GOODS  or persons may be 
seized  ON THE  HIGH SEAS,  while,  the  ship,  etc.,  gets off  scot-free. This 
sort of jurisprudence has—if  we  disregard  the  AUTHORITIES—been 
constantly asserted  by  England,  as I  have discovered  for  myself  by 
consulting Cobbett's Register3  on all the  squabbling that  has  gone 
on with neutrals since  1793. 
Conversely, since the English  CROWN LAWYERS  confined the 
problem  to an  ERROR  in forma  and  thus conceded  the  Yankees  the 
right to  seize  all  English ships with  BELLIGERENTS  aboard  and  bring 
them into port  FOR ADJUDICATION,  the  Yankees  may  very well—and  in 
my view will—declare that they  are  satisfied with this concession, 
that in future they will commit  no  formal infringements  in case  of 
seizure,  etc., and  deliver  up  Mason  and  Slidell  FOR THE  NONCE. 
If Pam is  absolutely  set on  war,  he can,  of course, bring  it about. 
In my  view, that  is not his  intention.  If the  Americans  act in the  way 
I imagine they will,  Pam  will have provided stupid John Bull with 
fresh proof that he is  'THE  TRULY  ENGLISH  MINISTER'.87'  The chap will 
then be  free  to do  whatever  he  likes.  He  will seize this 
opportunity, 
1. to force  the  Yankees  to recognise  the  Declaration  of Paris  on 
the rights  of the  neutrals378; 
2. to use  this as a  pretext  for  something  he has  hitherto  not  dared  to 
do, namely request  and  prevail upon  the  English Parliament  to 
sanction the abandonment of the  OLD  ENGLISH  MARITIME LAW,  the said 
abandonment having been subscribed  to by  Clarendon—on  his 
(Pam's) instructions—unbeknown  to the  Crown  and  without  the 
prior knowledge  of Parliament. 
Pam is an old man, and,  since  the  time  of Catherine  II, the 
Russians have been trying  to enforce  the  declaration published  in 
Paris.  There  are  still two  things they lack:  the  sanction  of the English 
Parliament and the accession of the  UNITED STATES.  On this occasion, 
both would  be  achieved.  It seems  to me  that these warlike alarums 
are simply theatrical props with which  to make stupid John Bull 
believe that the definitive abandonment of his own  MARITIME LAWS  in 
favour  of Russia  is a  victory over  the  Yankees  won  thanks  to the 
PLUCK  of the  'TRULY ENGLISH MINISTER'. 
Additional reasons  for  these warlike alarums seem  to be: 
Diversion  of attention from Poland  (for at  public meetings even 
fellows such  as Conningham from Brighton  are  demanding  the 
a Cobbett's Weekly Political Register 

=====第373页=====

STOPPAGE Of FURTHER PAYMENT of the DuTCH-RuSSIAN LOAN 9) and 
diversion of attention from Denmark where Russia is engaged at 
this moment in ousting Glücksburg, the HEIR PRESUMPTIVE appointed 
by herself. 380 
It is,  OF COURSE, possible that the Yankees won't give way, and, in 
that case, Pam will be forced into war by his preparations and 
rodomontade to date. However, I would rate the odds at 100 to 1 
against.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 27 December 1861 
Dear Engels, 
When the outside world first began to 'dun' me, I wrote — since 
I didn't want to be always pestering you — not only to my mother 
and other relations, but also to Siebel. Now that young man, as I 
see from his letter, has again written to you. Consider the matter 
as non avenue." 
I am extremely vexed that you should have had to give Dronke 
an I.O.U. for my sake. Originally, he promised to arrange the 
matter in less onerous a form and to give longer TERMS.*73 
I don't yet know quite how I am to weather this crisis. Whatever 
happens—since otherwise it would be plainly impossible—I shall 
write to my LANDLORD and tell him that he cannot be paid now, that 
I intend to give him a bill, etc. 
The court case is also going wrong.b Since the point at issue 
turns on PARTNERSHIP, my LAWYER considers it necessary—if I am not 
not having happened - h See this volume, pp. 327-28 and 334.

to be  made  to pay the  £20—that  the  case  be removed from  the 
SHERIFFS  COURT374  and taken before a  SUPERIOR  COURT.  I am due to 
appear at the  SHERIFF'S  COURT  on January 3rd. My mistake lay in not 
having concluded  a written contract with  A.  Petsch. Sidney,  my 
attorney, believes  I should  be  pretty safe  in the  SUPERIOR COURT. 
The rotten Presse  is printing barely half  my  articles. They're 
jackasses.  I wonder  how  they propose  to pay,  whether  I'm 
expected  to write individual articles  on  'spec',  or what? 
In the  meantime,  may I  wish  you in  advance every happiness 
for the New  Year.  If it's  anything like  the old one, I, for my  part, 
would sooner consign  it to the  devil. 
Salut.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 25 February 1862 
Dear Engels, 
My prolonged silence is due, not to anything 'intrinsic', but to 
the sordid state of affairs which I didn't want to bore and plague 
you with. 
As you know, on New Year's Day, I was able to SETTLE only that 
part of my debts which couldn't, or so it seemed, be put off any 
longer (e. g. my LANDLORD, to whom I shall owe a whole year's rent 
by the end of next month). Most of the money went on debts 
upon which bills had been drawn. 
The Vienna  'Presse',  as was only to be expected in view of the 
present rotten state of affairs in Germany, has not turned out to 
be the milch-cow it should have been. I am supposed to receive £1 
per ARTICLE. But since the fellows only print perhaps one article in 
four, and quite often none at all, damn-all comes of it except loss 
of time and annoyance at having to write on spec, whether or no 
the gracious editorial board condescends to accord the article its 
imprimatur. 
I had to give way in my lawsuit with Koller, a the main reason 
being that, as soon as the SOLICITOR wanted a £30 advance since the 
case went to a SUPERIOR  COURT,  I was not, of course, able to produce 
that sum. I had to pay/the SOLICITOR £5 for himself and for the 
COUNSEL he had retained, and also come to an arrangement with 
Koller whereby I am to pay him £18 by monthly instalments of 
£2; I paid him the first £2 on the last day of January, and have to 
pay the next £2 at the end of February, but what with, I don't 
know. 
During the past 2 months the Presse has printed so little of my 
stuff that I have no balance there worth mentioning. 
What makes the situation even PLEASANTEK is that for nearly 2 
months now little Jenny has been undergoing medical treatment. 
The child has grown visibly thinner. Jenny is now already old 
enough to feel the full strain and also the stigma of our 
circumstances, and I think this is one of the main causes of her

physical indisposition. (Apropos. Yesterday Allen prescribed wine 
for her, and I'd therefore be grateful if you could send down 
a few bottles.) For instance, unbeknown to us, she called on 
Mrs Young to see whether she mightn't go on the stage. 
TAKE ALL IN ALL, leading such a dog's life is hardly WORTH WHILE. 
As regards the copies of Urquhart's paper,a I haven't yet been 
able to get hold of them. Write and let me know with which issue to 
begin,  and Collet will do what is necessary. Herewith the chap's 
denunciation of Bakunin,b whom I haven't seen. He is living at

MARX TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 383 
IN GENEVA 
London, 26 February 1862 
Dear Becker, 
You must attribute my prolonged silence to one thing only—my 
inability to help. The American civil war has meant the total loss 
of my principal source of income for a whole year. Subsequently 
(a couple of months ago), this 'business' was resumed, but on a 
very 'restricted' basis.384  So far as acquaintances are concerned, 
however, I can count very few who have any means at their 
disposal. E. g., it is some while since that I wrote to Siebel on your 
behalf 42 but I am told by Borkheim that he gave no signs of life. 
In Manchester, a few 'revolutionary adventurers, who were sailing

to the United States for the good cause,' had scraped the bottom 
of the barrel. 
Now, as regards the subscription to your work,3 I shall do my 
utmost but can hold out little hope. All the riff-raff in the 
associations here—with the exception of the Workers' Educational 
Society,3 which has nothing in the way of funds— is constitutional, 
and actually favours the Prussian National Association.24 The 
fellows would sooner give money to have a work like yours 
suppressed. As you probably know, these Germans, both young 
and old, are all of them pert men of sterling worth and practical 
insight, and look upon people like you and me as immature fools 
who have still not recovered from their revolutionary fancies. Nor 
is the riff-raff at home any better than it is abroad. The time I 
spent in Berlin,b etc., convinced me that any attempt to influence 
the canaille by literary means would prove utterly futile. The 
fellows' self-complacent stupidity, which possesses in its press— 
that pitiable press—an extraordinary elixir of life, is beyond 
belief.  And then the spiritual passivity to boot—nothing 
short of a sound thrashing would reanimate your stolid German 
who,  having lost his philosophical illusions and applied himself to 
money-making and 'Little Germany' and 'practical constitutional­
ism', is now no better than an impulsive CLOWN. So far as I'm 
concerned, Germany may altogether [...],' but a roomful of 
precocious and decrepit children."1 
The Hermann is the property of the erstwhile Royal Prussian 
Procurator Heintzmann: 'with God for King and Fatherland', 'a 
modicum of Little Germany' and moderation in the exercise of 
freedom. A namesake of yours, one Becker from Leipzig, who writes 
for that paper, is a good chap but not influential enough to help us in 
a matter such as a subscription. Engels only returned to Manchester 
a few days ago after an absence of several months. He and Wolff (of 
Breslau) e will do what they can. However, with the exception of the 
above-named and 3 or 4 others, the numerous German population 
in Manchester consists of the same philistines as it does here and 
everywhere else. 
Quoad 1 'Vogt'g, do with it as you please. It goes without saying, 
of course, that I could not but be delighted if the pamphlet which

the press has all but killed by silence in Germany, could be 
used to some effect at least in Switzerland. A French translation 
was made in Paris, without my previous knowledge, and was 
already being printed but vanished by supreme imperial ukase.a 
So, in fact, there is no French edition. 
Let me assure you, my dear friend, that nothing could be more 
painful to me than to have to stand by helpless and passive and 
witness the struggles of a man such as  yourself.  I admire your 
steadfastness, your fervour, and your energy. The Ancients—I 
think it was Aeschines—said that one should endeavour to acquire 
worldly goods so that one might help one's friends in need! What 
profound and humane wisdom lies therein! 
At the earliest possible opportunity I shall let you know the 
result of communications to various persons about the subscrip­
tion. 
In the meantime, farewell. My wife asks to be kindly remem­
bered to you.

I shall get the £2 for Koller 3 off to you tomorrow or on

This year, I am spending more than my income. The crisis is

money as possible; unfortunately, I can't dispense with my

The wine hasn't arrived  yet. 
I should  be grateful  if you  could  let me  have this week  (by  Friday 
morning3)  an  article  in English  on the  American war.387  You can 
write  it without  the  slightest misgiving.  The  Tribune will print  it as 
the LETTER  OF A  FOREIGN OFFICER.  Nota bene: The Tribune hates 
McClellan,  who is in  league with  the  Democratic Party  and, 
throughout the period in which he was  COMMANDER  IN CHIEF  OK AIL THE 
ARMIES,  prevented  any  action  by  intervening directly  not  only  on the 
Potomac (where this  may  have been justified),  but in  every theatre 
of war,  especially  in the  west.  (He was  also  at the  bottom  of the 
highly infamous intrigue against Fremont. 388) Moreover,  out of 
esprit  de corps  and a  hatred  of CIVILIANS,  this same  Mac has  sheltered 
all the  army's traitors,  e.g.,  Colonel Maynard  and  General Stone. 
The latter's arrest took place  a day or 2  after Clellan  had  been 
dismissed as  COMMANDER  IN CHIEF  of all the armies. Similarly, the New 
York Herald's impudent  'REPRÉSENTA FIVE'  b in Washington was 
arrested  as a SPY  against McClellan's wishes, having  on the 
previous  day  entertained McC.'s entire  STAFF  to a  champagne 
breakfast. 
You will recall  my  having told  you  from  the  start that nothing 
would come  of the  expectations regarding  the  China trade. This  is 
confirmed by the latest  BOARD  OF TRADE  report:c 
1860 1861 
[£] [£] 
China 2,872,045 3,114,157 
Hong Kong 2,445,991  1,733,967 
Total 5,318,036 4,848,124 
So, a decrease  in total exports. More  of them direct, fewer  via 
Hong Kong.  In the  meantime,  the  Russians have seized another 
fine island  off  Korea.'1  Add to  this their  new  'OCCUPAI IONS' in Java," 
and their supremacy of the  NORTHERN PACIFIC  is assured.' 89 The 
extent  to  which Pam's influence  has  russified  the  entire English 
press  is borne  out by its  profound silence over Russia's  PROGRESS  in 
this area, ditto  its  passive attitude vis-à-vis Poland.

Dear Moor, 
Enclosed POST OFFICE ORDER for £2, Camden Town. 
The book" went off long ago, i.e. on 9 October,in a parcel to 
our agent E. Schröder in Amsterdam, and was enclosed in bale 
no. 118 for B. ter Haar and Son of that city. I enclosed a note to 
Schröder at the time, asking him to see to the thing. Everything 
was correctly addressed to your cousin ; c so all he can do, if he ' 
hasn't got it yet, is approach Schröder. 
You shall have the article.387 The braggarts of the South are now 
getting a splendid thrashing. Most cheering of all is the reception 
met with everywhere by the gunboats on the Tennessee river as 
far up as Florence, Alabama (here the mussel shoals begin, 
disrupting navigation). So in west Tennessee, in the plains, the 
majority is also decidedly pro-Union. 15,000 prisoners, including 
Johnston, the Confederates' best general, who decided Bull Run 
by his rapid concentration on the centre, is no laughing matter.390 
I shall be seeing Lupus this evening. If he can advance me 
something until 1 July, I shall get it for you. I myself shall be au

sec1 until then. Should there be [no] peace or some other 
settlement in America, it may well be that my total income from 
1 July 1861-62 will be reduced to £100 and I shall thus run into 
debt. We have a whole heap of goods and can't sell a thing and, if 
we are saddled with them until matters in America have been 
straightened out, we are likely to lose all the profit made up till 
the end of December.385 However, I imagine the scrap will 
continue, for I don't see how the fellows can make peace. 
What's this about a Russian island off Korea?b  And what's this 
about occupations in Java? (QUERY Japan?) Je n'en sais rien? How 
about the Free Presses? 
By the way, according to your figures, trade with China has

it alternated between 1 and 3 millions.

official Russian communiqués and reports from American con­
suls—all of them suppressed by the English press. I sent the 
relevant numbers to Urquhart and haven't yet got them back. I 
had previously used them for a Presse ARTICLE on the Russian 
advance in Asia. However, the jackasses didn't print it. Now, you 
know what a bad memory for names I've got. So, at the moment I 
can't provide you with the names. The first island a lies exactly half 
way between the south-western extremity of Japan and the Korean 
mainland. It has a large harbour and, according to the American 
account, is capable of becoming a second Sevastopol.b As regards 
the other islands that are actual Japanese possessions, one of them, 
if I am not mistaken, is called Jeso.c However, I shall see if I can 
retrieve the documents. 
Chinese trade, compared with what it was like up to 1852, has 
certainly increased, but by no means on the same scale .is have all 
other markets since the Californian-Australian discoveries.59] 
Moreover, in earlier REPORTS Hong Kong, as an English possession, 
is shown separately from China, so that exports under the heading 
'China' invariably (from the 40s on) amount to less than total 
exports. Finally, the increment achieved since 1859 fell back in 
1861 to its former level. 
In consequence of the American crisis, the  BOARD  OF TRADE  report 
for 1861d shows a considerable change in the ranking order 
of the various markets for English exports. India leads with 
£17,923,767 (including Ceylon and Singapore. India alone, 
£16,412,090). 
'Second market Germany, normally 4th. I860: £13,491,523. 1861: 
£12,937,073 (not including what goes via Holland and, to a lesser 
degree, via Belgium). In view of Germany's economic importance 
to England, what a diplomatic advantage it would give us, 
circumstances being different, over bluff John Bull! 
France this year the 5th market. 1860: £5,249,980. 1861: 
£8,896,282. However, that includes Switzerland as well. England, on 
the other hand, now ranks as the premier market for France. 
Out of the total exports of £125,115,133 (1861), £42,260,970 go 
to English 'POSSESSIONS' and 'COLONIES'. If one adds to that what 
England exports to other parts of Asia, Africa and America, there 
remains at most 23 to 24% for export to the countries of Europe.

Should Russia continue  to advance  in Asia  at the  same rapid pace 
as during  the  past  10  years, until  all her  EFFORTS  are  concentrated 
on India,  it will be the end of  John Bull's world market,  a demise 
that will  be hastened  by the  United States's protective tariff policy, 
which that country will certainly  be in no  hurry  to relinquish,  if 
only out of  REVENGE  against John. Moreover, John Bull  is 
discovering  to his  horror that  his  main colonies  in North America 
and Australia  are  becoming protectionist  to the  same extent  as he 
himself is becoming a  FREE TRADER.392  The complacent, brutal 
stupidity with which John  has  acclaimed Pam's  'SPIRITED POLICY'  in 
Asia and  America, will  one day  cost  him  damned dear. 
To me it  does  not  seem very  PROBABLE  that  the  SOUTHERNERS  will 
have concluded peace  by  July  1862.  When  the  NORTHERNERS  have 
1. secured  the  BORDER  STATES—and  it is  upon these,  in fact, that 
everything  has  centred from  the  starta—and  2. the  Mississippi  as 
far as New  Orleans  and  Texas,  the war may  well enter  a 2nd  phase 
during which  the  NORTHERNERS  will make  no  great exertions  of a 
military nature  but, by  isolating  the  GULF STATES,339  finally bring 
them  to the  point  of voluntary  RE ANNEXATION. 
During this  war  Bull  has  acted with what must  be  wholly 
unprecedented effrontery.393 
In terms  of brutality  on the  English side,  the  Mexican Blue Book'' 
exceeds anything previously known  in history. Menshikov appears 
a GENTLEMAN  compared with  Sir C.  Lennox Wyke.  Not  only does this 
blackguard evince  the  most immoderate zèle' in the  execution  of 
Pam's secret instructions  but, by his  insolence, also seeks  to avenge 
himself  for the  fact that,  in the  exchange  of diplomatic dispatches, 
Sefior Zamacona,  the  Mexican Foreign Minister  (how  resigned) 
and erstwhile journalist, invariably proves himself superior.  As for 
the chap's style, herewith  a few  examples from  his  dispatches  to 
Zamacona. 
* 'The arbitrary  act of  stopping  all  payments  for the  space  of two  years394  is 
depriving  the  parties interested  of their money  for  that space  of time, which  is a  dead 
loss of so much value  to them.'  'A starving  man may  justify,  in his own  eyes,  the  fact 
of stealing  a loaf on the  ground that imperious necessity impelled  him  thereto;  but 
such an argument cannot,  in a  moral point  of view, justify  his  violation  of the law, 
which remains  as positive, apart from  all  sentimentality,  as if the  crime  had not had 
an excuse.  // he was actually  starving,  he should have first asked  the  baker  to assuage 
his hunger,  but  doing so' (starving?) 'of his own free  will,  without permission,  is acting

occasion.' 'With regard  to the  light  in which  you  view  the  question,  as expressed  in

had a full right  to complain  ... of  having first  of all  heard  of this extraordinary 
measure  ... by  seeing  it in  printed bills placarded through  the  public streets....'b 
'I have  a duty  to perform both  to my own Gvt. and to  that  to which  I am 
accredited, which impels me...,' etc. c 
'I suspend  all official relations with  the  Government  of this Republic until that

DIPLOMATISTS  in the past 25 years have been largely to blame for the 
TROUBLES  in Mexico/ Wyke replies that 
*'the population  of Mexico  is so  degraded  as to  make them dangerous,  not  only 
to themselves,  but to  everybody coming into contact with them!'*^ 
Zamacona writes, saying that the propositions he [Wyke] has 
made would put an end to the Republic's independence, and were 
incompatible with the dignity of any independent state. h Wyke 
replies: 
* 'Excuse  me for  adding that such  a proposition  as I  have made  to you  does  not 
necessarily become undignified  and  impracticable simply because  you, an  interested 
person,'* (i.e., Foreign Minister  of Mexico) *'are pleased  to say  so.'*'

Dear Engels, 
Because your article" failed to arrive, I have been unable to 
write to New York today. My relations with the Tribune are no 
longer such that, if (assuming they print the article) I send them 
SOMETHING  ELSE in place of the sequel, they will print it. Rather, I am 
convinced that they are on the point of giving me my congé again 
along with all the other European correspondents. Their format has 
been reduced. They print perhaps one article in 3 or none at all. 
These are the usual indications of such a procedure. 
So, let me have the sequel by Tuesdayh or better still, the 
conclusion, since it is only the conjectural part relating to the future 
that can be of any real interest to them. 
I'm not getting on very well with my book,310 since work is often 
checked, i.e. suspended, for weeks on end by domestic distur­
bances. Little Jenny is still by no means as well as she should be.'

Dear Frederick, 
My wife was discreet enough not to write to Dana. What the 
intention was is now unmistakably evident from the fact that the 
fellows don't even send me the Tribune any more.390 
Enclosed letter from Friedländer. Arrived on Saturday. a Fine 
ideas these Germans have. I am to send him an article on the 
opening [of the exhibition344 ], which, with the SEASON  TICKET  needed to 
this end, the clothes I'd have to buy and sundry incidental 
expenses, would cost me at least 10 guineas—and, IN EXCHANGE, the 
prospect of selling a total of 4 to 6 articles à £8 (summa 
summarum h), or, at very best, à £12. And, since one must always 
assume the minimum where these chaps are concerned, I should 
actually lose money on the 4 articles! I have written to tell him 42 
that I am confined to my room and cannot therefore send off on 
Thursday the desired inaugural sermon but shall, from time to 
time,  submit a few articles on the exhibition along with the 
other ones. So far as the 'other' articles are concerned, the cat is now 
out of the bag.c 1 article per week (o £1), and even that is 
hedged about with somewhat hypothetical clauses. I must accept, 
of course, and have already accepted, since something is better 
than nothing at all. What the chaps are particularly interested in at 
the moment is America, and I should be grateful if you would 
send me an article (before the end of the week that is) on the 
progress of the war (I mean the battle of Corinth396), and 
generally write to me from now on whenever military events take 
a new turn. If only to disseminate correct views on this important 
matter in the land of the Teutons. (I had already revised your 
earlier articles for them; were published, what's more.d)

the pleasure of becoming acquainted with the Vienna Presse or the 
Berlin National-Zeitung, the old Neapolitan would have abandoned 
this preconceived idea. 
On arriving in London,897  I found a letter from my LANDLORD, in 
which he said he would call today (28 April) in order to get the 
rest of the £20. However, he can't have a centime. During my 
month's absence, the list of debts relating to IMMEDIATE NECESSITIES 
has, of course, grown. In addition, there are 2 extra items that 
must be paid for and are even more urgent than the LANDLORD. 
Firstly, £7 for the piano MASTER since, CIRCUMSTANCES being what they 
are, my wife had to give him notice and hence must also pay him. 
Secondly, £10's worth must be redeemed from the pawn-shop, 
whither have departed not only the children's things but also those 
of the maids, right down to their boots and shoes. Because of the 
LANDLORD, I have so far remained incognito (excepto Borkheim), so 
that my wife may tell him that I have not yet returned and 
attempt to put him off indefinitely. For it's a question of SHIFTING. 
So far Borkheim has advanced £20; promises the remainder for 
the beginning of next week. 398 
My wife saw Dronke in the street with madame and offspring, 
but they didn't see her. 
As regards Ariadne, adhuc sub judice lis est.3 For the disputed 
point in this case is a legal one. In Diodorusb  she figures as a star. 
I don't find her shown as a constellation. Rather, indeed, as a 
planetoid, No. 43, Plate II, Mädler, latest issue, 5th Edition (which I 
have),  Berlin 1861. So, at all events, the girl is in the firmament. 
As things stand, it is a nice legal point as to whether you or Lupus 
have won. Your general contention that all those persons placed 
by the Greeks among the stars live on in the astronomical charts 
would also seem to be doubtful in the extreme. 
What was it you wanted besides the English army ESTIMATES? AS 
soon as I am 'mobile' again, I shall see to the matter. 
Kinkel has departed with his tail between his legs. He makes no

from time immemorial, the said swine has been using regularly

editor of the Gartenlaube. But the real joke is that, after the

proceed with the matter, and it was only with difficulty that 
Gottfried engineered the final 'set-to'. 399 However, I am writing to 
Eichhoff,  instructing him to drop the matter for the time being, 
since otherwise he'll take the edge off Gottfried's defeat. 42 For

Dear Lassalle, 
You'll be terribly angry with me,  OLD  BOY,  and justifiably so, but, 
at the same time, with absolutely no justification. If I postponed 
writing to you from one day to the next, it was because I was 
hoping from one day to the next to put my affairs so far in order 
as to be able at least to pay off the £10 I owed you and, besides, 
write to you with an easy  mind.  Instead, the situation has grown

again—though at V3 of my former income—has finally got rid of 
all its foreign correspondents. So, I now find myself in a complete 
vacuum. I have no intention of treating you to a tale of woe of any 
sort; it's a wonder I haven't actually gone mad. If I mention the 
beastly mess at all, it's simply so that my other misfortunes should 
not be compounded by a misunderstanding with you. 
What you say about J. Ph. Becker in your last letter is absolutely 
wrong.401 I. e., you don't know the man except from hearsay. He 
is one of the noblest German revolutionaries there has been since 
1830,  a man who can be reproached with nothing save an en­
thusiasm which fails to take account of circumstances. As for his 
connections with the Italians, a bosom friend of Orsini's3 has 
entrusted me with papers that leave no room for doubt on this 
score, whatever the Italians, and even Garibaldi, may say. As for 
his relationship with Tiirr—whom I had denounced over here in 
The Free  Press  even before 1859402—all it amounts to is this: During 
the Baden campaign403  Becker made Türr a lieutenant. Hence a 
kind of comradely relationship. Had Becker intended to exploit 
this connection and accept the offers made him in Paris by Türr 
in the presence of one of my London friends, 13 he would not have 
endured the martyrdom which he, a man of 60, is in fact 
enduring. I know full well the sources whence Becker has 
obtained his exiguous financial support. They are confined to 
people within our closest circle. True, he fell foul of some of the 
Italians because his strongly Teutonic sentiments caused him to 
reject certain well-intentioned plans. It is indeed exasperating that 
men of Becker's stamp should be so egregiously slandered. 
As for my book?10 it won't be finished for another two months. 
During the past year, to keep myself from starving, I have had to 
do the most despicable hackwork and have often gone for months 
without being able to add a line to the 'thing'. And there is also 
that quirk I have of finding fault with anything I have written 
and not looked at for a month, so that I have to revise it completely. 
At all events, the work loses nothing thereby, and pro annoc the 
German public has, after all, far weightier things to think about. 
Ad vocemd your booke which I have of course now quite 
finished, and individual chapters reread, it strikes me that you 
apparently haven't read Vico's 'new science'. Not that you'd have 
found anything in it immediately to your purpose; but it does 
provide a philosophical view of the spirit of Roman law,

contrasting with that of the legal philistines. You would scarcely be 
able to work your way through the original, as it is not only 
written in Italian but in a very peculiar Neapolitan idiom." 
However, I commend the French translation, La Science nouvelle, 
etc.; traduite par l'auteur de l'essai sur la formation du dogme 
catholique. Paris, Charpentier, Editeur —1844. To whet your 
appetite, I shall do no more than quote the following sentences: 
'L'ancien droit romain a été un poème sérieux, et l'ancienne jurisprudence a 
été une poésie sévère dans laquelle se trouvent renfermés les premiers efforts de la 
métaphysique légale.' '...l'ancienne jurisprudence était très poétique, puisqu'elle 
supposait vrais les faits qui ne l'étaient pas, et qu'elle refusait d'admettre comme 
vrais les faits qui l'étaient en effet; qu'elle considérait les vwans comme morts, et les 
morts comme vivans dans leurs héritages.' 'Les Latins nommèrent heri les héros; d'où 
vient le mot hereditas ... l'héritier ... représente, vis-à-vis de l'héritage, le père de 
famille défunt.' b 
Vico contains in embryo Wolf (Horher), c Niebuhr {Römische 
Königsgeschichte), A the fundamentals of comparative linguistics 
(even if in fanciful form) and a whole mass of really inspired  stuff. 
So far, I have never been able to get hold of his legal writings 
proper. 
Under the circumstances in which I now find myself (and have 
found myself for the better part of a year) I shall not be able to do 
a critique of your book until  BY AND  BY. On the other hand, I should 
be grateful, not for my own sake, but for that of my wife, if, without 
a prior quid pro quo on my part, you could let Brockhaus advertise 
the first part of the political economy. 
Never have the English middle classes (and aristocracy) put their 
foot in it with such effrontery as during the great struggle that is 
taking place on the far side of the Atlantic. By contrast, the 
English  WORKING  CLASS,  which suffers most from the bellum civile,' has 
never before shown itself as heroic and noble. This is the more 
admirable when one knows, as I do, all the mechanisms that were 
set in motion, both here and in Manchester, to incite them to stage 
a G. Vico, Principj di una scienza nuova. - b  'Ancient Roman law was a grave poem and 
ancient jurisprudence austere poetry which contained the first attempt to formulate 
legal metaphysics.' '...ancient jurisprudence was highly poetical in that it supposed 
true those facts that were not so, and refused to admit the truth of facts that 
were so indeed; in that it regarded the living as  dead,  and the dead as living in their 
inheritance.' 'The Latins called heroes heri; whence comes the word hereditas ... 
the heir ... represents, vis-à-vis the inheritance, the deceased pater familias.' -

As to the Tribune, I saw in the Manchester Examiner and Times' 
LITERARY  GOSSIP  an item to the effect that Dana is resigning from the 
Tribune  'ON  ACCOUNT  OF DIFFERENCES  OF OPINION  WITH MR  HORACE  GREELEY'.  SO, 
that old jackass  WITH  THE FACE  ANGELIC  seems to have been behind it all.405 
But I wouldn't let the fellows off just like that without at least 
writing to Dana, asking for further elucidation as to what it all 
means and who is now  MANAGING  the Tribune in his place, so that 
you know whom you are to have recourse to. If the chaps want to 
sever the connection, at least get them to say so; I wouldn't just 
tamely put up with indirect hints. If you were subsequently to go 
to another New York journal, they could always say that you were 
being disloyal to them. Besides, they must surely give a reason. 
Borkheim writes to say that he has paid the balance of the 
money, so I hope you will be saved from arrest." 
Ad vocemb Ariadne, there's no doubt I'm right.0 All the old 
constellations still exist on the modern charts. What Diodorus 
maintains is not authoritative. The fellow wasn't an astronomer. 
Moreover, it was a question of the wording. I betted on 
constellation. But subsequently it struck me, too, that she figures 
among the recently discovered asteroids; that, however, has 
absolutely nothing to do with the case, of course. 
What I want besides the WAR  DEPARTMENT  ESTIMATES  (for 1862) is a 
PAPER  laid before Parliament which sets out the new organisation of 
the Indian native army (as it has existed since 1861) (i.e., the 
number of regiments with their old and new names and in what 
way these have been retained or renumbered).0 
Can you send me The Free Press for April? I shall try and get 
hold of the May issue up here. 
As regards America: 
1. Battle of Corinth.396 May be classed with all well fought major 
modern battles, in which the antagonists have been of approxi­
mately equal strength. Eylau, Wagram, Liitzen, Bautzen (admitted­
ly the French were much stronger here, but, being without 
cavalry, they were incapable of pursuit), Borodino, Magenta, 
Solferino.406 The battle, to use Clausewitz's words, smouldered 
away like damp powder, exhausting both sides, and, when it was 
over, the positive advantages gained by the victorious side were of 
a moral rather than a material nature.e At all events, the

momentary advantage gained by Beauregard on Sunday2 was 
more intensive and much greater than that gained by Grant and 
Buell on Monday. The bulk of the trophies went to the 
Confederates, even though they were ultimately beaten, i.e., 
compelled to forego their attack and withdraw. That is the tactical 
aspect. But the strategic one is this: 
Beauregard had concentrated all the troops he could get hold of 
so as to pounce on the approaching Federal divisions, one by one 
when possible. This miscarried; the troops under Grant, Buell and 
Wallace were sufficient to repulse him. Had they lost this battle, 
the Federals would have lost Tennessee; now they have kept it. It 
was thanks only to the redoubts at Corinth that Beauregard was 
not at once compelled to move further south. Whether these 
earthworks are capable of protecting him from an attack by 
Halleck (who has now assumed command), there is no way of 
telling. No more can we credit the rumour that he has received 
massive reinforcements from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. 
If this is to some extent the case, they can certainly be nothing but 
raw recruits, who will be more of a hindrance to him than a help. 
On the other hand, the forces at Pittsburg Landing were so close 
to being evenly matched that, without reinforcements, Halleck, too, 
will find it difficult to carry out an assault on a fortified camp or 
undertake some other major offensive operation. We don't know 
what troops the Federals still have in Tennessee or Kentucky, 
other than those engaged at Pittsburg Landing, so it's hard to say 
what the odds are. In the meantime, the Unionists have cut the 
railway from Memphis to Chattanooga (i.e., to Richmond, 
Charleston, Savannah), both to the west as well as to the east of 
Corinth. Consequently, Beauregard is restricted to one railway (to 
Mobile and New Orleans), and the question arises whether his 
troops will be able to subsist in Corinth for any appreciable time.407 
2. Virginia. Hero McClellan is IN  A DEAD  FIX. I think this will mark 
the passing of his spurious glory. He has had another division 
transferred to him from McDowell, but that won't help him much. 
All that can save him are the ironclads, yet another of which (the 
Galena) has sailed for Monroe. Concerning this topic, see today's 
Morning Star, American news; of great interest to Austria. You will 
also learn from it why, not long ago, the Monitor lay quietly at 
anchor when the Merrimac, the Yorktown, etc., seized the 3 trans­
ports.  If they cleared the rivers to right and left and engaged

the flanks and rear with their guns, these ships could once again 
save this jackass or traitor,a in the same way as the gunboats at 
Pittsburg Landing saved Sherman (who had nothing but young 
troops, who had never been under fire before). 
3. MOUNTAIN DEPARTMENT. Fremont is still at Wheeling, the result 
being that the mountainous portion of south Virginia as well as 
east Tennessee is still in enemy hands. I.e., the very best Union 
regional Impossible to explain why. At all events, the Confederate 
regiment that was raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, as recently as 
the beginning of April, will doubtless go over at the first shot. 
Bonaparte is up to his tricks again in America. He'll take good 
care not to stir up that hornet's nest. Before the year was out (vide 
'Morning Star'), his ironclads and likewise all French merchantmen 
would be gone from the ocean, and then farewell to pleasure! 
Apropos. You will have seen in today's Standard (or Morning

MARX TO ENGELS 249 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 6 May [1862] 
Dear Frederick, 
As soon as you have shown it to Lupus, send back the enclosed, 
exceedingly odd letter, which was published, although mutilated, 
in the Siècle, the Temps and the Progrès de Lyon, by the jeunesse 
hongroise à Paris* and sent to me by Schily. 409 This same 'jeunesse' 
now proposes to let loose a pamphlet containing remarkable 
revelations about the Kossuth-Klapka-Türr triumvirate in Paris. 
Apropos. You might communicate the  FACTS  contained in the 
letter to  Eichhoff,  57 Ranelagh Street, Liverpool. He can get the 
thing into the Zeitung für Norddeutschland (Hanover). 
A little while ago, so Schily writes, the Bern  Bund b (mightn't you 
be able to look this up at the Club?) carried a statement by a 
Hungarian refugee in which Vogt is called 'the Palais Royal's 410 
fattened sow', while Fazy, Kossuth, Klapka, and Türr figure as 
'scoundrels and gamblers'. 
I have got back 330 copies of Vogtc  from that blackguard Koller. 
If only I knew of an opening! Might this not be the moment to 
dispose of them at a 100 p.c. loss? I. e., in Geneva and Bern. How 
opportune that would be just now! 
I shall send you the April and May numbers of the Press.d In 
future you shall have them regularly. I shall procure the other 
stuff for you, i.e. the ESTIMATES. 
As TO WINE, what the children most prefer, of course, is a motley 
collection. I believe that, according to Allen, claret and port are 
best. 
I shall write to Dana again. I sorely miss their sending me the 
Tribune. This is a rotten trick of Greeley's and McElrath's. I 
discovered two things in the final March numbers of the Tribune. 
First, that McClellan had been fully informed a week beforehand 
about the withdrawal of the CONFEDERATES." Secondly, that during

What makes me lose confidence in any success where the 
Yankees are concerned isn't so much the military situation as such, 
which is what it is only as a result of the indolence and 
indifference apparent throughout the North. Where, amongst the 
people, is there any sign of revolutionary vigour? They allow 
themselves to be thrashed and are downright proud of the 
lambasting they get. Where, throughout the North, is there the 
slightest indication that people are in real earnest about anything? 
I've never encountered the like of it before, not even in Germany 
at the worst of times. On the contrary, what the Yankees would 
already seem to relish above all else is the prospect of doing down 
their government creditors.

Dear Engels, 
A week ago last Thursday, you wrote saying you intended to 
send some wine for little Jenny and Co.413 I showed the children 
your letter. The wine failed to arrive so they were disappointed. I 
attach importance to it just now because it's a distraction for them, 
and the house is otherwise very forlorn. 
Nothing could be worse than the kind of oppressiveness which 
now broods over the whole place. 
Luckily, I have neither heard nor seen anything of the 
EXHIBITION344 or its visitors, and hope that this 'immunity' will 
continue, since I am now in no position to entertain PEOPLE. 
As soon as you have a moment to spare, let me know briefly 
what you think of the military operations in the UNITED STATES, 
particularly McClellan's deeds of derring-do. 
Salut.

I have had to dispense with port on this occasion too, since it 
is at my lodgings and I wasn't able to get it sent over to the 
WAREHOUSE. The hamper is leaving today. The red wine and 1846 
Hochheimer are specially for little Jenny. The 3 bottles with the 
red seal and no label are 1857 Riidesheimer (the same as we 
drank up here); too stimulating for invalids, though excellent for 
those in good health. 
Strdhn was here (as you can see, cela ne finit pas with these 
visits").  He was in Berlin shortly before the dissolution 408 and 
indulged in much carousing with the Rhenish deputies. The 
fellows took the whole situation tremendously seriously, trusted in 
their omnipotence, and have relapsed into parliamentary cretinism 
almost as felicitously as at any time in 1848.414 Red Becker,b whose 
hair has become much paler in the meantime, trotted round all 
day in EVENING DRESS, black from top to toe, and a dress-coat. His 
paunch is fatter than ever. Mr Rudolf Schramm, LATE  OF Striegau,415 
was also gadding about there and complaining to all who would listen 
to him that nowhere did the public wish to elect him, which was 
beyond his comprehension. One evening Schramm was talking 
some colossal rubbish about England, whereupon Strohn 
said to him: 'Now listen, Mr Schramm, if I'd been in England as 
long as you, I'd be ashamed to talk such nonsense; you must have 
been asleep the whole time you were there.' Whereat Schramm, 
usually so insolent, replied: 'In England, you know, I was 
compelled, on account of my wife, to mix with company where I 
was not in my element and, for that very reason, couldn't see the 
people I should like to have seen!!!' 
McClellan is carrying on in his familiar manner. The Confeder­
ates always give him the slip because he never makes straight for 
them, his excuse being that they are  A GOOD  DEAL  stronger than he is. 
That is why they keep on running away. Never before has a war 
been waged like this, in return for which he will get his vote of 
thanks. In the meantime, these wretched little rearguard actions 
and the constant desertions are certainly enough to demoralise the 
Confederates severely, and, if it comes to a decisive battle, they'll 
find this out. 
The capture of New Orleans was a daring feat on the part of 
the navy.416 Quite outstanding—the passage of the forts, especial­
ly. Afterwards everything was simple. The moral effect on the 
Confederates was obviously enormous, and the material effect will 
a no end to these visits (see this volume, p. 364). - b  Hermann Heinrich Becker

already have made itself felt. Beauregard in Corinth now has 
nothing left to defend; the position had served a purpose only so 
long as it protected Mississippi and Louisiana, particularly New 
Orleans. Strategically, Beauregard has been put in a position 
where one lost battle will leave him no alternative but to disband 
his army and employ them as guerrillas, for without a large city in 
the rear of his army as a focal point of railways and resources, he 
cannot marshal massed bodies of men. 
If the Confederate army is beaten in Virginia, it must, after the 
demoralising incidents of the past, quickly disband of its own 
accord and operate as guerrillas. Admittedly, its prospects are 
better, because the numerous rivers run from the mountains to 
the sea athwart its line of withdrawal, and also because it is facing 
that jackass McClellan; however, it is in the nature of things that it 
will be forced either to accept a decisive battle or to split up into 
bands without a battle. Just as the Russians were compelled to fight 
at Smolensk and Borodino417 against the will of the generals who 
had judged the situation correctly. 
If Beauregard, or the army of Virginia, wins a battle, however 
big, it can be of little help. The Confederates are not in a position 
to derive the slightest benefit from it. They can't advance 20 
English miles without getting stuck and hence must await a fresh 
attack. They lack everything. Incidentally, I regard such an 
eventuality as quite impossible without outright treachery. 
So, the fate of the Confederate armies now hangs on one single 
battle. We have still to examine the prospects for guerrilla warfare. 
Now, it is exceedingly surprising that in this of all wars the part 
played by the population should have been not so much small as 
non-existent. In 1813, French communications were repeatedly 
disrupted and harassed by Colomb, Lützow, Chernyshev and a 
score of other leaders of irregulars and Cossacks; in 1812, in 
Russia, the population vanished completely from the French line 
of march; in 1814 the French peasants took up arms and killed 
allied patrols and stragglers, but here nothing whatever is 
happening. They abide by the outcome of the big battles and console 
themselves with victrix causa diis, etc. a All that boasting about a war 
to the knife has turned out to be just rubbish. And how can 
guerrillas be expected to fare on such a terrain? I certainly 
anticipate that the WHITE  TRASH  of the South418 will try something of 
the sort after the final disbandment of the armies, but I'm too 
a Victrix causa diis placuit, sed vicia Catoni —the conquering cause was pleasing to 
the Gods, but the conquered one to Cato (Lucan, Pharsalia, I, 128).

convinced  of the  bourgeois nature  of the  planters  to doubt  for .one 
instant that this would  at once turn them into rabid pro-Unionists. 
Just let  those others make  an  attempt  at  BRIGANDAGE  and the 
planters everywhere will receive  the  Yankees312 with open arms. 
The BONFIRES along  the  Mississippi  may be  attributed solely  to the 2 
chaps from Kentucky  who are  said  to have arrived  in Louisville— 
certainly  not by the  Mississippi.  The  fire  in New  Orleans  was 
easily organised  and  will  be repeated  in other cities; elsewhere, 
too, a great deal will undoubtedly  be burnt down,  but the  affair 
must inevitably bring  to a  head  the  SPLIT between  the  planters  and 
the merchants on the one hand, and the  WHITE  TRASH  on the other, 
and then  it will  be all up  with secession. 
The fanatical support  for the  Confederation among  the New 
Orleans merchants  is accounted  for  simply  by the  fact that  the 
fellows  had to  accept  a mass  of CONFEDERATION  SCRIPS  in exchange  for 
cash.  I know  of several examples here. This should  not be 
forgotten.  A good,  big  forced loan  is a  splendid means  of 
shackling  the  bourgeois  to the  revolution  and  diverting them from 
their class interests  by way of  their personal interests.

[London,] 27 May 1862 
Dear Frederick, 
The children and the  WHOLE  FAMILY  send you their best thanks for 
the spirituous hamper. 
In Eichhoff's letter enclosed herewith, you will find, recaptured 
to the life, the kind of polemics beloved of Parson Kinkel. Where 
would Gottfried be without his piss-a-bed! a 
I may not have written to tell you yet that Dr Klein in Cologne 
has won 35,000 talers in the Prussian lottery; he will now probably 
marry Mrs Daniels, provided he hasn't changed his mind. 
It's quite true that Bernard, always very eccentric and having in 
any case overworked during the past few weeks, has become 
subject to 'hallucinations'. The only UNFAIR thing about it is that this 
was instantly seized upon as an opportunity to put him away, 
which was quite unnecessary since the family in Dorking to whom 
he was tutor was prepared to look after and assume responsibility 
for him. Ditto Allsop. But the presence of the latter, who had 
provided the money for Orsini's assassination attempt,419 and his 
renewed intercourse with Bernard, had long been worrying 
Bonaparte's police, at whose request the English police had long 
been keeping an eye on Bernard. 
Last Saturdayh I received from my Gas Company a summary 
demand that I pay them £1 10/- before next Saturday, failing which 
(it's a final notice) I shall be 'cut off. Since I am now sans sou,r I am 
forced in this mess to turn to you. 
The blowing up of the Merrimac seems to me a clear indication 
of cowardice on the part of the Confederate swine.420 The curs 
might still have hazarded another throw. It's truly marvellous how 
The Times (which backed all the anti-Irish COERCION BILLS 421 with 
such intense enthusiasm) is now lamenting that 'liberty' will be lost 
should the North tyrannise over the South.d The Economist is no 
less pleasing. In the last issue, it declares that it finds the financial 
good fortune of the  YANKEES—the  non-depreciation of their paper

money— incomprehensible (although  the  thing  is as  plain  as a  pike­
staff). 3 Up  till then  it had, for  week after week, consoled  its readers 
with talk  of such depreciation. Although  it now  admits  to not 
understanding what  it should know about  ex officio  and  hence  to 
having misled  its readers  on the  subject,  it presently consoles them 
with gloomy reflections  on the  'military operations',  of which  it 
officially understands nothing. 
What made paper operations exceptionally easy  for the  YAN­
KEES422  (given  the  main factor—confidence  in  their cause  and 
hence  in  their government)  was  undoubtedly  the  circumstance 
that,  as a  result  of secession,  the  West  was  virtually stripped  of 
paper money, i.e. of a  CIRCULATING MEDIUM  generally. All the banks 
whose principal  SECURITIES  consisted in  BONDS  issued by the  SLAVE 
STATES,  went bankrupt.  In addition, there  was a  drain  of  CURRENCY 
amounting  to MILLIONS  which  had  circulated  in the  West  in the  form 
of actual bank notes issued  by the  SOUTHERN BANKS.  Then, partly  as a 
result  of the  Morrill  Tariff 423 and  partly  as a  result  of the war 
itself,  which  had  largely  put a  stop  to the  import  of luxury goods, 
throughout  the  whole period  the  YANKEES  had a  favourable balance 
of trade,  and  hence rate  of  exchange, vis-à-vis Europe.  An 
unfavourable rate  of exchange might have gravely affected  the 
philistines' patriotic confidence  in paper. 
How absurd,  by the by, is  John Bull's concern over  the  interest 
UNCLE  SAM will have  to pay on the  national debt!  As  though  it 
weren't  a bagatelle  by comparison with Bull's national debt, besides 
which  the  UNITED STALES  is now  undoubtedly richer than were  the 
BULLS  in 1815,  with their debt  of a  milliard. 
Hasn't  Pam got  Bonaparte into  a fine  old  mess  in Mexico?424 
I have now—if only  out of  DESPERATION—really  put my  nose  to 
the grindstone  and am  writing away  for  dear life—at  the  political 
economy  I mean.310

Dear Moor, 
Herewith the POST OFFICE ORDER for £2, payable Kentish Town, 
which, if I'm not mistaken, is the office closest to you. 
Siebel has been blessed with a baby daughter. 
Anneke is with Buell's Army and, as from today, will be writing 
for the Augsburg paper.3 I feel somewhat anxious about Halleck's 
troops; the thing's been dragging on so long and he would 
not seem to be getting any reinforcements after all,426 although 
Spence's lies in The Times certainly do not mean anything.13  Willich is 
colonel (THE ETERNAL COLONEL!) commanding the 32nd Indiana 
Regiment. 
As for the business of Klein,c I am heartily glad for his sake, 
poor devil. I'll return Eichhoff's letter to you as soon as I've read 
it to Lupus, but I can't go and see him at the moment, as I have a 
swollen tonsil, which has kept me at home these past few evenings. 
It now seems as though some kind of guerrilla warfare has 
started up after all, but certainly nothing of any significance and, 
should there be just one victory, reinforcements will move up 
together with some cavalry and soon put paid to the thing. A 
defeat might well prove disastrous.

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 4 June 1862 
Dear Moor, 
I hope you got the POST OFFICE ORDER for £2 I sent off last Friday 
on Kentish Town  POST  OFFICE.3 
So, at last we learn from Anneke's letter that on 26 April 
Halleck had rather more than 100,000 men and 300 cannon incl. 
Pope and Mitchel, and that he was awaiting the arrival of Curtis 
and Sigel with further reinforcements. Up till 29 April the state of 
the army appears to have been passable on the whole, nor does 
Anneke say anything about sickness. Hence, I consider the talk of 
sickness to be pure invention. Still, one is bound to admit that 
Stanton and Halleck have a way of making both press and public 
mistrustful; it should actually be easy enough to have one 
correspondent with each army who would write what the general 
tells him so that the public at any rate can get some sort of news. 
The big battle, then, will doubtless be fought as soon as Sigel 
and Curtis arrive. Spence's estimate that 120,000 men are needed 
to keep the  BORDER  STATES  in order is ludicrous; b in Kentucky hardly 
a man would appear to be under arms (apart, perhaps, from the 
recruits at the training camp at Louisville, from whom Sigel's 
corps will doubtless be formed) and in Nashville, according to 
Anneke, there are nothing but convalescents, etc.; otherwise, apart 
from Halleck's and McClellan's armies, the only ones still 
remaining in the  BORDER  STATES  are Fremont (who apparently has no 
army at all yet), Banks (who must be very short of men) and 
McDowell, though they all count as part of the regular army. 
However, Spence errs in the other direction, 1. at this moment the 
armies of the FEDERALS certainly do not amount to a total of 
500,000 men, 2. they have undoubtedly allocated more than 
90,000 to the coast. My rough estimate is as follows: 
On the coast 100,000 men 
Banks & Fremont 30,000 "

Sigel & Curtis 30,000 men 
McClellan 80,000 »* 
At Washington 30,000 »» 
McDowell 30,000 " 
Halleck 100,000 >» 
Hence a total of 400,000 men in the field, to which should be 
added approx. 60,000 recruits, convalescents and small detach­
ments who are probably dispersed about Missouri, along each 
bank of the lower Ohio and Tennessee, and partly among the 
cities of the North-East; summa summarum 460,000 men. I am 
confirmed in this by the new draft of 50,000 men which will be 
followed very shortly by another of equal size; evidently, the 
intention is to maintain the army at its normal strength of 500,000 
men. 
It was a colossal blunder on Stanton's part, and sheer 
boastfulness, to put a stop to recruiting. Materially, it has done a 
great deal of harm and was the cause of all that waste of time at 
Corinth and Richmond; and morally the present revocation will do 
even more harm—aside from the fact that it will now be much 
more difficult to get recruits. It's not as though there weren't 
plenty of men available; as a result of immigration, the Northern 
States must have, in terms of total population, at least 3-4% more 
men aged between 20 and 35 than any other country. 
In other respects in his letters Monsieur Anneke appears to be 
the same grumpy old FAULTFINDER and knowall he always was, who 
judges the army, not in accordance with circumstances or even the 
enemy, but rather with the old, trained European armies and not 
even these as they are, but as they ought to be. The blockhead 
would do well to reflect on the confusion he himself must have 
experienced often enough during manoeuvres in Prussia. 
The comedy in Berlin is getting very funny indeed. The 
ministry assures the Chamber of its liberalism and the Chamber 
assures the King of its royalism. Embrassez-vous et que  cela  finisse! 427 
In other respects, it is undoubtedly a sign of progress that people 
are getting so nicely and so rapidly embroiled in parliamentary 
intrigue; however, there'll be a conflict all right. Very fine, too, 
that nothing came of the whole Hesse-Cassel affair until the 
Electora had personally insulted handsome William,b whereupon it 
really did come to nothing.428

ENGELS TO CARL SIEBEL 
IN BARMEN 
Manchester, 4 June 1862 
Dear Siebel, 
You're a fine OrT», you are, notifying me of your daughter's birth 
after the same fashion as I [use] to acknowledge your various letters 
and packages. My heartiest congratulations. I hope you'll have a lot 
of fun with her. Is your wife all right? 
Here things trundle along as always. All the same, I'm gradually 
beginning to notice how demoralising this quiet routine is; one is 
drained of all one's energy and becomes thoroughly indolent. I 
even read another novel recently. 
The so-called—salva veniah—Schiller Institute429 (also known 
as the Jerusalem Club) has become a purely Jewish institution 
and, between 1:30 and 3, the din there is enough to drive one out of 
one's mind. In fact, I very seldom visit the noble institution now. 
What's happening is typically Jewish. To start off with they thank 
God for having a Schiller Institute, and barely are they installed 
than, apparently, it's not good enough for them, and they want to 
put up a large building, a veritable temple of Moses, and to move 
the thing there. That, of course, is the shortest road to 
bankruptcy. And it's for that you had to write a prologue and act 
as producer! And that's what they call a German national 
a See this volume, p. 369. - b if one may refer to it thus

institution! Mark my words, in a couple of years you'll be sent a 
circular: Re the bankruptcy of the late Schiller Institute', etc. 
'Re' your letters, let me reply very briefly as follows. So far as 
the affair with Marx is concerned, he would certainly not have 
turned to you if my resources hadn't already been exhausted, as 
was indeed the case, which meant that I could do nothing just 
then. As for red Becker (whose pamphlet3 was of great interest to 
me, partly because it contains a  RECANTATION  of his former 'wild' 
opinions, and also because the Prussian government has forcibly 
turned the chap into a local bigwig again, and hence into a 
Deputy), the fellow is no immediate concern of ours. He has never 
belonged to our party as such, has always been a mere democrat, 
and he only became involved in the business of the Communist 
trial in Cologne2 because he regarded the affair as an opportunity 
for agitation. In fact, during the trial he disassociated himself 
completely from the rest of the accused and enjoyed a special 
position. Since then he has avowedly become a royal Prussian 
democrat, has come out in favour of the monarchy, etc. So, 
politically we have no connections whatever with the man, which 
would not, of course, preclude my being on a personally friendly 
footing with him until such time as we came into direct political 
conflict with his people. He will do well enough for the present 
Prussian Chamber. 
I believe that, when I was in Barmen,354  I mentioned to you a 
little Danish folk-song I had discovered in the Kjämpeviser and 
had translated into German verse specially for your benefit. 430 I 
enclose it. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do anything like justice 
to the lively, defiantly cheerful tone of the original—it's the 
liveliest I know. However, you'll have to content yourself with the 
translation (almost literal, by the way). I don't think the thing has 
been translated into German before. 
Please*" convey my compliments and good wishes to your wife.

have sent Engels and Wolff c the copies intended for them) was all

the more welcome to me for arriving at a time when I was feeling 
far from cheerful. Moreover, although I had only read, or rather 
leafed through, very little of Schmidt's  stuff,  I have at heart always 
detested the chap as the quintessence of  MIDDLE-CLASS  SNOBBISM,  no less 
revolting in literature than elsewhere. As you rightly intimate, 
your attack is aimed indirectly at the MIDDLE-CLASS cultural vul­
garians. Here it's a case of aiming at the donkey blows intended 
for the driver. 3 Since we can't for the present actually  CROP-  the 
driver's ears for him, it increasingly behoves us to slice the heads 
off the noisiest and most pretentious of his cultural donkeys—with 
our pens, notwithstanding  POOR  Meyen who, in the Freischütz, 
found 'this literary playing at guillotines' as puerile as it was 
barbaric. b What especially tickled me was the Schwabenspiegel and 
the 'seven wise men'—I almost said 'seven Swabians'—of 
Greece. 431 Incidentally—since in the case of Julian Schmidt, Julian 
the Grabovite432 (which is unjust, because it looks like a blow 
aimed at the Apostate,c or, at any rate, casts SOME RIDICULE on the 
other Julian), one may permit oneself to digress—I was at one 
time greatly interested in the awpos d  as the mask peculiar to Greek 
philosophy (using mask here in the best sense). First, we have the 
seven Swabians or wise men as FORERUNNERS, mythological heroes, 
next, in the middle, Socrates, and finally, the  <ro<po<;  as the ideal of 
the Epicureans, Stoics, and sceptics. 433 I derived further amuse­
ment from drawing a comparison between this owpoç and what is 
(IN SOME RESPECTS) his caricature, the French 'sage' of the 18th 
century. And then the o,o<pi.o,Tr|çe  as a necessary variant of the 
coco«;. It is typical of the moderns that the Greek combination of 
character and knowledge implicit in the crcxpàç has survived in 
popular consciousness solely in the form of sophists. 
Julian—not Julian the Grabovite, but Julian the Apostate—was 
the cause of a recent brush I had with Engels who, as I was 
already aware when the dispute began, was essentially in the right. 
But so specific is my aversion to Christianity that I have a 
predilection for the Apostate and do not like to see him identified 
either with Frederick William IV or with any other romantic 
reactionary, not even mutatis mutandis! Don't you feel the same? 
Your admonition as to Rodbertus and Roscher reminded me 
that I still had notes to make from and about both.434 As regards 
a Marx plays here on the German proverb 'to hit the bag instead of the 
donkey'. - b  Marx presumably refers to Meyen's first article from the series 'Berliner 
Briefe' published in Der Freischütz, No. 49, 23 April 1861. - c Julian the 
Apostate - d wise man - e Sophist - f altered as necessary

the Rodbertus,a I failed to do it justice in my first letter to you.b 
There's really much in it that is good. Except that his attempt 
to produce a new theory of rent is almost puerile, comical. For 
he would have us believe that, in agriculture, raw materials are 
not taken into account because—the German farmer, or so 
Rodbertus maintains, does not himself regard seed, fodder, etc., as 
expenditure, does not take these production costs into account, i.e., 
he reckons wrong. In England, where the FARMER has been reckoning 
correctly for over 150 years now, rent ought not, therefore, to exist. 
Hence the conclusion would not be that drawn by 
Rodbertus, namely that the tenant pays rent because his RATE of 
profit is higher than in industry, but rather because, in conse­
quence of his wrong reckoning, he contents himself with a lower RATE 
of profit. This one example, by the by, suffices to show me how the 
partial under-development of German economic conditions neces­
sarily tends to confuse people. Ricardo's theory of rent as it now 
stands is undoubtedly false, but every objection that has been raised 
against it is either due to a misunderstanding of it or at best 
demonstrates that certain phenomena do not, prima facie,c  tally with 
Ricardo's theory. Now, this latter fact in no way discounts a theory. 
On the other hand, the positive theories that set out to refute 
Ricardo are vastly more false. Puerile though Mr Rodbertus's 
positive solution may be, it does, nevertheless, tend in the right 
direction, but to go into that here would take too long. 
As regards the Röscher, it will be some weeks before I can sit 
down with the book d beside me and write any comments on it. I 
shall reserve this fellow for a note. Such professorial schoolboys 
have no place in the text. Roscher undoubtedly has a considera­
ble—and often quite useless—knowledge of literature, although 
even here I seem to discern the Göttingen alumnus" rummaging 
uneasily through literary treasures and familiar only with what 
might be called official, RESPECTABLE literature. But that's not all. For 
what avails me a fellow who, even though he knows the whole of 
mathematical literature, yet understands nothing of mathematics? 
And so complacent, self-important, tolerably well-versed, eclectic a 
dog, too! If only such a professorial schoolboy, by nature totally 
incapable of ever doing more than learn his lesson and teach it, of

ever reaching  the  stage  of  teaching himself,  if  only such  a 
Wagner" were,  at least, honest  and  conscientious,  he  could  be of 
some vise  to his  pupils.  If only  he  didn't indulge  in spurious 
evasions  and  said frankly: 'Here  we  have  a contradiction. Some  say 
this,  others that.  The  nature  of the  thing precludes  my  having  an 
opinion.  Now see if you can  work  it out for  yourselves!'  In this 
way his  pupils would,  on the one  hand,  be given something  to go 
on and, on the  other,  be  induced  to work  on  their  own  account. 
But, admittedly,  the  challenge  I have thrown  out  here  is 
incompatible with  the  nature  of the  professorial schoolboy.  An 
inability  to understand  the  questions themselves  is essentiellement'' 
part and  parcel  of him,  which  is why his  eclecticism merely goes 
snuffling round amidst  the  wealth  of set  answers;  but,  here again, 
not honestly, but  ALWAYS WITH  AN EYE TO THE  PREJUDICES AND  THE  INTERESTS OK 
HIS PAYMASTERS!  A stonebreaker is  RESPECTABLE  by comparison with such 
canaille. 
Ad vocem' Toby.  If you  believe  you can use  Toby Meyen, then 
use him.  Only don't forget that  the  company  of a  dunderhead  can 
be very compromising unless great precautions  be  taken. 
We are,  indeed,  but few in  number—and therein lies  our 
strength. 
We shall  all be  very glad  to see you  over here.  It will greatly 
please  my  family,  not to  mention  myself,  as they hardly ever  see a

MARX TO ENGELS 435 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 18 June 1862 
Dear Engels, 
The idea of pouring out my misère to you again sickens me, but 
que faire"? Every day my wife says she wishes she and the children 
were safely in their graves, and I really cannot blame her, for the 
humiliations, torments and alarums that one has to go through in 
such a situation are indeed indescribable. As you know, the £50 
went on debts, more than half of which remain to be paid. 398 The 
£2 on gas. The wretched money from Vienna won't arrive till the 
end of July, and then there'll be damned little of it, since the 
swine aren't even printing 1 article a week now. To that must be 
added the fresh expenditure since the beginning of May. I won't 
say anything about what, in London, is the truly parlous situation 
of being without a centime for 7 weeks—since for us it is a 
chronically recurring state of affairs. But from your own 
experience, you will at any rate know that, all the time, there are 
current expenses that have to be paid in cash. This has been done 
by putting back in pawn the stuff that had been redeemed at the 
end of April. But that source was exhausted weeks ago, so much 
so that, a week ago, my wife attempted to sell some books of mine 
'in vain'. I feel all the more sorry for the unfortunate children in 
that all this is happening during the EXHIBITION SEASON,344 when their 
friends are having fun, whereas they themselves live in dread lest 
someone should come and see them and realise what a mess they 
are in. 
For the rest, I  myself,  by the "by, am working away hard and, 
strange to say, my grey matter is functioning better in the midst of 
the surrounding misère than it has done for years. I am expanding 
this volume, 310 since those German scoundrels estimate the value 
of a book in terms of its cubic capacity. Incidentally, another thing 
I have at last been able to sort out is the shitty rent business 
(which, however, I shall not so piuch as allude to in this part). 434 I 
had long harboured MISGIVINGS as to the absolute correctness of 
Ricardo's theory, and have at length got to the bottom of the 
what can one do? 

=====第417页=====

swindle.3 Again, since we last saw each other, I've hit on one or 
two pleasing and surprising novelties in connection with what's 
already going into this volume. 
I'm amused that Darwin,*1 at whom I've been taking another 
look, should say that he also applies the 'Malthusian' theory to 
plants and animals, as though in Mr Malthus's casec  the whole 
thing didn't lie in its not being applied to plants and animals, but 
only—with its geometric progression—to humans as against 
plants and animals. It is remarkable how Darwin rediscov­
ers, among the beasts and plants, the society of England with its 
division of labour, competition, opening up of new markets, 
'inventions' and Malthusian 'struggle for existence'. It is Hobbes' 
bellum omnium contra omnes'' and is reminiscent of Hegel's 
Phenomenology," in which civil society figures as an 'intellectual 
animal kingdom', whereas, in Darwin, the animal kingdom figures 
as civil society. 
Buckle has played a trick on Ruge by dying. In his imagination, 
Ruge had envisaged another library to be written by Buckle and 
'transposed' into German by Ruge. POOR Ruge! And POOR Buckle 
who,  this very day, is traduced by a 'friend' in a testimonium 
pietatis' in The Times? 
Have you and Lupus received the 2 Julian  Schmidts 1* I sent off? 
Apropos. If it could be done very briefly, without making undue 
demands on you, I should like to have a sample of Italian 
book-keeping (with explanations). It would help to throw light on 
Dr Quesnay's Tableau Economique. 4m 
No one comes to see me, and I'm glad of it, for I don't give a 
for the sort we have here. A fine crew!

Herewith 1 Press* and two very clever 'talks' by Lassalle. b 
The enclosed letter from- Lassalle was brought me by the 
Austrian 'Captain (retd.)' Schweigen, a worthy, stupid fellow. The 
joke is that Riistow—with the added support of 2 Rüstow 
brothers—has proposed or is proposing so to use the National 
Association, 24 the Gymnastic Association, etc., as to have, at the 
crucial moment—in the smaller German states, at least—a 
ready-made militia commanded by Mr Rüstow to pit against the 
army. It's a damn silly plan. And, on top of that, the money for it 
is to come from London! I don't believe Lassalle shares these 
DELUSIONS. AIL he wants is to make himself seem important in the 
eyes of Schweigert, etc. 
I hope that yoi\, at any rate, will come to London  IN THE  COURSE  OF

ENGELS TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 23 July 1862 
Dear Lassalle, 
I should have written to you long since and thanked you for the 
many packages you have been kind enough to send me. I resolved 
to do so often enough over the past 18 months, but have been so 
taken up with doux  commerce*  that my private correspondence with 
all and sundry is badly in arrears. Now I hear you are in London 
and I would have liked to have come down last Saturday, but 
simply could not get away. I presently cherish a similar plan in 
respect of Friday b evening, but cannot yet say for certain whether 
I shall be able to carry it out. If at all possible, it shall be done, in 
which case I shall telegraph Marx at midday on Friday. But if it 
proves impossible, why shouldn't you come up here on Friday 
evening or Saturday morning and spend a few days taking a look 
at the home of cotton? Then we could also slip over to Liverpool 
which is well worth the trouble, especially since you are concerning 
yourself with political economy. There's a room in my lodgings at 
your disposal. It only takes you 5 1/2 hours to get here. 
So, think the matter over and, if I should be unable to take 
Saturday off, you can decide on the spur of the moment, leave 
London at 9 o'clock on Saturday morning, and be here by 2.45. 
We shall then be able to discuss everything else by word of 
mouth—either here or there. 
In the meantime, cordial regards from 
Yours,

ENGELS TO MARX 249 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 30 July 1862 
Dear Moor, 
I was very sorry not to have been able^o come on Friday.3 Apart 
from anything else, I had more or less iallen out with Ermen, and 
hence could neither ask a favour of him, nor stay away without 
saying a word. Otherwise, nothing would have prevented me from 
coming, not even the risk of missing sometning important on the 
Saturday. 
Things are going awry in America and, in fact, Mr Stanton is 
AFTER  ALL chiefly to blame in that, after the conquest of Tennessee, 
sheer boastfulness led him to stop recruiting, so that the army was 
doomed to grow constantly weaker at the very time when it 
particularly needed reinforcing with a view to a rapid and decisive 
offensive. With a steady influx of recruits the war had hitherto 
not, perhaps, been decided, but there could be no doubt about its 
successful outcome. Moreover, the run of victories had ensured a 
brisk supply of recruits. 
This measure was all the more inane in that, at that very time, 
the South was calling up all men aged between 18 and 35, i.e. 
staking everything on one throw. It is these men, who have 
meanwhile become seasoned troops, that have since enabled the 
Confederates to gain the upper hand everywhere, and assured 
them the initiative. They pinned down Halleck, drove Curtis out 
of Arkansas, beat McClellan and, in the Sbenandoah Valley, under 
Jackson, gave the signal for guerrilla bands, which are now already 
penetrating as far as the Ohio. Stanton could not have acted more 
stupidly had he tried.439 
Again, when Stanton saw that he would be unable to oust 
McClellan from the command of the Potomac Army, he perpet­
rated the stupidity of reducing McClellan's strength by 
detaching special commands to Fremont, Banks and McDowell, 
and dispersing the forces with a view to displacing McClellan. Not 
only was McClellan defeated as a result, but public opinion is

laying the blame for that defeat, not on McClellan, but on Stanton. 
Serves Mr Stanton right. 
None of this would have signified, and it might even have been 
all to the good in as much as the war might at last have been 
conducted along revolutionary lines. But there's the rub. Defeats 
don't spur these Yankee»; on, they just make them flabby. If 
things have come to such a pass that, to get recruits at all, they say 
they are prepared to take them on for only 9 months, then this is 
tantamount to admitting: 'We're in the shit and all we want is a 
make-believe army to do some sabre-rattling during the peace 
negotiations.' Those 300,000 volunteers, that was the criterion, 
and in refusing to muster them, the North is declaring that it 
doesn't, au fond'  give a damn about the whole thing. And then, 
what cowardice on the part of the government and Congress! 
They shrink from conscription, from resolute fiscal measures, 
from attacking slavery, from everything that is urgently necessary; 
everything's left to amble along at will, and, if some factitious 
measure finally gets through Congress, the honourable Lincoln 
hedges it about with so many clauses that it's reduced to nothing at 
all. It is this flabbiness, this wilting like a pricked balloon 
under the pressure of defeats, which have destroyed an army, 
the strongest and the best, and left Washington virtually unde­
fended, it is this complete absence of any resilience among the 
people at large which proves to me  THAT  IT is ALL UP. The occasional  MASS 
MEETING,  etc., means nothing at all, and doesn't even rival the 
excitement of a presidential election. 
Add to that a complete want of talent. One general more stupid 
than the other. Not one who would be capable of the slightest 
initiative or of an independent decision. For 3 months the 
initiative has again rested wholly with the enemy. Then, the fiscal 
measures, each one crazier than the last. Fecklessness and 
cowardice everywhere except among the common soldiers. The 
same applies to the politicians—just as absurd, just as much at a 
loss. And the populus is more feckless than if it had idled away 
3,000 years under the Austrian sceptre. 
For the South, on the other  hand—ITS  NO USE  SHUTTING  ONES EYES  TO 
THE FACT—the  affair is a matter of life and death. Our not getting 
any cotton is one proof of this. The guerrillas in the Border States 
are another. But, in my view, what clinches the matter is the ability 
of an agrarian population, after such complete isolation from the 
rest of the world, to endure snch a war and, having suffered 
11 at bottom

severe defeats and the loss of resources, men and territory, 
nevertheless to emerge victorious and threaten to carry their 
offensive into the North. On top of that, they are really fighting 
quite splendidly, and what remained of UNION FEELING, save in the 
mountain districts, will now, with the re-occupation of Kentucky 
and Tennessee, undoubtedly evaporate. 
If they get Missouri, they will also get the TERRITORIES,440 and then 
the North might as well pack up and go home. 
As I have already said, unless the North instantly adopts a 
revolutionary stance, it will get the terrible thrashing it deserves— 
and that's what seems to be happening.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 30 July [1862] 
Dear Engels, 
From the enclosed scrawls you will partly see how BOTHERED I am. 
So far, the LANDLORD has allowed himself to be placated; he has yet 
to receive £25. The piano chap, who is being paid in instalments 
for the piano, should already have had £6 at the end of June, and 
is a most ill-mannered brute. I have rate demands in the house 
amounting to £6. The wretched school fees—some £10—I have 
fortunately been able to pay, for I do my utmost to spare the 
children direct humiliation. I have paid the butcher $6 on account 
(the sum total of my quarterly takings from the Presse]), but I'm 
again being dunned by that fellow, not to mention the baker, the 
TEAGROCER, the GREENGROCER, and such other sons of Belial as there 
may be.

The Jewish NIGGER Lassalle who, I'm glad to say, is leaving at the 
end of this week, has happily lost another  5,000  talers in an 
ill-judged speculation. The chap would sooner throw money down 
the drain than lend it to a 'friend', even though his interest and 
capital were guaranteed. In this he bases himself on the view that 
he ought to live the life of a Jewish baron, or Jew created a baron 
(no doubt by the countess 3). Just imagine! This fellow, knowing 
about the American affair,405 etc., and hence about the state of 
crisis I'm in, had the insolence to ask me whether I would be 
willing to hand over one of my daughters to la Hatzfeldt as 
a 'companion', and whether he himself should secure Gersten-
berg's (!) patronage for me! The fellow has wasted my time and, what 
is more, the dolt opined that, since I was not engaged upon any 
'business' just now, but merely upon a 'theoretical work', I might just 
as well kill time with him! In order to keep up certain dehorsh  vis-à-vis 
the fellow, my wife had to put in pawn everything that wasn't actually 
nailed or bolted down! 
Had I not been in this appalling position and vexed by the way 
this parvenu flaunted his money bags, he'd have amused me 
tremendously. Since I last saw him a year ago, he's gone quite 
mad. His head has been completely turned by his stay in Zurich 
(with Rüstow, Herwegh, etc.) and the subsequent trip to Italy and, 
after that, by his Herr Julian Schmidt, c etc. He is now indisputably, 
not only the greatest scholar, the profoundest thinker, the most 
brilliant man of science, and so forth, but also and in addition, 
Don Juan cum revolutionary Cardinal Richelieu. Add to this, the 
incessant chatter in a high, falsetto voice, the unaesthetic, 
histrionic gestures, the dogmatic tone! 
As a profound secret, he told me and my wife that he had 
advised Garibaldi not to make Rome the target of his attack but 
instead proceed to Naples, there set himself up as dictator 
(without affronting Victor Emmanuel), and call out the people's 
army for a campaign against Austria. Lassalle had him conjure 
300,000 men out of thin air—with whom, of course, the 
Piedmontese army joined forces. And then, in accordance with a 
plan approved, so he says, by Mr Rüstow, a detached corps was to 
make, or rather set sail, for the Adriatic coast (Dalmatia) and incite 
Hungary to revolt, while, heedless of the Quadrilateral, 442 the 
main body of the army under Garibaldi marched from Padua to 
Vienna, where the population instantly rebelled. All over in 6

weeks. The fulcrum of the action—Lassalle's political influence, or 
his pen, in Berlin. And Rüstow at the head of a corps of German 
volunteers attached to Garibaldi. Bonaparte, on the other hand, 
was paralysed by this Lassallean coup d'éclat. 3 
He has just been to see Mazzini, and 'the latter, too,' approved and 
'admired' his plan. 
He introduced himself to these people as the 'representative of 
the German revolutionary working class' and assumed they knew 
(to use his own words) that his (Izzy's) 'pamphlet on the Italian 
warb  had prevented Prussia's intervention' and,  IN FACT, that he had 
controlled 'the history of the past three years'. Lassalle was 
absolutely furious with me and my wife for poking fun at his 
plans,  quizzing him as 'an enlightened Bonapartist', etc. He 
shouted, blustered, flung himself about and finally got it fixed in 
his mind that I was too 'abstract' to understand politics. 
As TO AMERICA, it's of no interest whatever, he says. The Yankees 
have no 'ideas'. 'The freedom of the individual' is merely a 
'negative idea', etc., and other antiquated, mouldering, speculative 
rubbish of the same ilk. 
As I have said, if circumstances had been different (and he 
hadn't disrupted my work), the chap would have amused me 
tremendously. 
And on top of it all, the sheer gluttony and wanton lechery of 
this 'idealist'! 
It is now quite plain to me—as the shape of his head and the 
way his hair grows also testify—that he is descended from the 
negroes who accompanied Moses' flight from Egypt (unless his 
mother or paternal grandmother interbred with a NIGGER). NOW, 
this blend of Jewishness and Germanness, on the one hand, and 
basic negroid stock, on the other, must inevitably give rise to a 
peculiar product. The fellow's importunity is also niggerlike. 
If, by the by, Mr Rüstow was responsible for thinking up the 
march from Padua to Vienna, I should say that he also has a screw 
loose. 
Salut.

Semitic descent. The main evidence: in the Book of Maccabbees,3 
the Jews send emissaries to solicit the help of Greece on grounds 
of kinship. Furthermore, an Etruscan inscription has been found 
in Perugia, and this was simultaneously deciphered by Hofrat 
Stücker in Berlin and an Italian, and both independently 
converted the Etruscan into the Hebrew alphabet. 
So that we can no longer discomfit him with 'BLUE BOOKS',443 he 
has bought 20 pounds' worth of  BLUE BOOKS  (under Bucher's 
guidance). 
He has converted Bücher to socialism, or so he maintains. Now 
Bucher's quite a fine little man, if a cranky one, and, in any case, I 
can't believe that he has accepted Lassalle's 'foreign policy'. Bücher 
is the 'compositress' in Julian Schmidt. 444

Dear Moor, 
No doubt you will understand that, after the heavy outgoings 
last month, it will be impossible for me to get hold of £25 for you 
just now. I have postponed till August all heavy outgoings on my 
own account (LANDLADY and quarterly account), moreover, because 
of the bill, I have had to give Borkheim an order, which will 
similarly have to be met in August. I shall see what can be done 
before tomorrow. I still owe Lupus £10, and he will ask for it 
immediately on his return, 445 which might be any day now. If you

add this to last month's outgoings, you will see that it takes a tidy 
slice out of the new financial year. However, I shall see this 
evening how much will have to be paid out, and hence how much 
I shall be able to send you. 
If only I knew what the balance looked like and how I stand! 
But the day after tomorrow Charles3 leaves for Warsaw, where we 
have incurred a bad debt, and then the whole caboodle will come

Dear Moor, 
The enclosed £10 is all I am able to send you today. This is how 
things stand: Last month's outgoings: a quarter's stabling for my 
horse £15, LANDLADY £25 (old Hill agreed to debit this to July 
because I paid it yesterday), to Borkheim £50, to you £10, total 
£100.  Still outstanding this month: to Lupus £10, Borkheim—for 
the order—£15, bookseller about £10 (carried over from 1861), in 
addition, petty expenses: tailor, shoemaker, shirts, and such like, 
cigars some £25 and the above-mentioned £10, in all £70, or £170 
in two months, excluding CURRENT  EXPENSES.  So, you can see how I stand. 
On top of that, I am pretty well positive that I exceeded my 
income in the last financial year and that my income for this one 
will be very poor. I dare say you might succeed in staving the 
people off a bit longer, something that can't be done in the case of 
my creditors since the people here have a habit of descending on 
one at the office and demanding settlement so that, after the 2nd 
or 3rd CALLING, one is morally obliged to pay them.

Should Lupus not require the £10 I still owe him until the end 
•of September, or be satisfied with payment by instalments, I shall, 
of course, let you have it. 
The stories about Lassalle are exceedingly funny. His strategical 
plan 3 is the finest I have ever come across. That Rüstow should 
have approved it is quite possible. The chap's as vain as Izzy and 
well on the way to being just as crazy. Cf. his maunderings about 
the campaign of 1860 in Vol. II of the Demokratische Studien!' 
The author' of the Europäische Pentarchie has unloosed a new 
opus,  Europa's Cabinette und Allianzen. And a superb jackass the 
Russians have bought themselves, too. Never before have I come 
across anything so stupid and muddle-headed. When he theorises 
about international law, the fellow's really choice for he puts 
forward 3 or 4 different theories that are mutually exclusive. 
Added to which, Christianity à outrance? and flattery of all things 
Russian laid on so crassly that one can't help laughing out loud at 
the thought of the money the Russians have chucked away on 
him. It redounds to Germany's credit that they shouldn't have 
been able to buy a single fellow worth his salt to write in favour of 
Russia" and, when they chance to nab one, such as B. Bauer, that 
he should instantly turn into a dolt. 446 His master-plan envisages a 
Russo-French alliance, Prussia at the head of Little Germany,24 
Austria, her capital removed to Budapest, to get the Danubian 
principalities and all the territory north of*' the Balkans—this 
spread out like an old cowpat over 300 pages of the most dreary 
twaddle. If you'd like to have the thing, I'll send it you.

MARX  TO ENGELS 447 
IX MANCHESTER 
[London,]  2 August  1862 
Dear Frederick, 
Best thanks  for the £10. 
I very much dislike your being  in financial difficulties  on my 
account,  but que  faire?''  Who is  capable  of withstanding such  a 
crisis  as the  American one?  iHl Not to  mention  my  peculiar  bad 
luck in having  a rotten  rag  like the  Vienna Presse  to deal with. 
OTHERWISE,  the  fellows might,  at least, have been able  to make  up 
for the  loss  of the  Tribune TO  SOME  EX FEM. Do you  suppose, 
perhaps, that  the  time  has now  come  for me to  approach,  say,  the 
Evening Post (HIE  ABOUEIOXISI  PAPER  in New York) about my 
contributing  to it? 
All things considered,  it's a  real miracle that  I have been able  to 
get on  with  my  theoretical writing  to  such  an  extent.  I now 
propose after  all to  include  in this volume  an extra chapter  on the 
theory  of rent,  i.e., by way of  'illustration'  to an  earlier thesis  of 
mine.1'4  Let me say a  word  or two  about what will,  in the  text, be a 
lengthy  and  complex affair,  so  that you  may  let me have your opinion 
on it. 
As you  know,  I distinguish  2 parts  in capital: constant capital 
(raw material, matières instrumentales^ machinery, etc.), whose value 
only reappears  in the  value  of the  product,  and  secondly variable 
capital,  i.e., the  capital laid  out in  wages, which contains less 
materialised labour than  is given  by the  worker  in return  for it. 
E.g. if the  daily wage=10 hours  and the  worker works  12, he 
replaces  the  variable capital  + '/s of the  same  (2 hours). This latter 
surplus I call  SV.RPI.VS VALVE. 
Let us assume that  the  rate of surplus value (that  is the  length  of 
the working  day and the  surplus labour  in excess  of the  necessary 
labour performed  by the  worker  to reproduce  his pay) is  given, 
e.g. = 50 p.c. In  this case,  in a 12  hour working  day the  worker 
would work  e.g. 8  hours  for  himself,  and 4  hours  (s/2) for the 
EMPLOYER.  And  indeed,  let us  assume this  to apply  to all  TRADES  SO that 
any variations there may be in the  AVERAGE WORKING TIME  simply allow 
for the  greater  or  lesser difficulty  of the  work,  etc. 
a what  is one to do? - ''  auxiliary materials 

=====第431页=====
232. Marx  to Engels.  2 August  1862 395 
In these circumstances, given equal exploitation  of the  worker  in 
different  TRADES,  different capitals  in different spheres  of produc­
tion will, given equal size, yield very different  AMOUNTS OF SURPLUS 
VALUE  and hence very different rates of profit,  SINCE  PROFIT  IS NOTHING BUT 
THE PROPORTION  OF  THF:  SURPLUS VALUE  TO THE  TOTAL CAPITAL ADVANCED. This 
will depend  on the  organic composition  of the  capital,  i.e., on its 
division into constant  and  variable capital. 
Let us  assume,  as  above, that  the  surplus labour=50  p.c. If, 
therefore,  e.g.  £1 = 1 working  day (no  matter whether  you  think  in 
terms  of a day or a  week, etc.),  the  working day=12 hours,  and 
the necessary labour  (i.e.  reproductive  of the  pay) = 8 hours, then 
the wage  of 30  workers  (or  working days)=£20  and the  value  of 
their labour=£30,  the  variable capital  per  worker (daily  or 
weekly) =£2/3 and the value he creates = £1. The  AMOUNT  of SURPLUS 
VALUE  produced by a capital of £100 in  DIFFERENT  TRADES  will vary greatly 
according  to the  proportion  in which  the  capital  of £100  is divided 
into constant  and  variable capital.  Let us  call  CONSTANT CAPITAL  C, and 
VARIABLE  CAPITAL  V. If, e.g. in the  COTTON  industry, the composition was 
C 80, V 20, the  value  of the  product would=110 (given  50 p.c. 
surplus value  or SURPLUS LABOUR).  The  amount  of the surplus value=  10 
and the  profit rate=10  p.c.,  since  the  profit=the proportion  of 10 
(the  SURPLUS  VALUE)  : 100 (the total value  OF THE CAPITAL  EXPENDED).  Let us 
suppose that,  in a  large tailoring shop,  the  composition  is C 50, V 50, 
so that  the  product=125,  the  surplus value  (at a  rate  of 50  p.c.  as 
above)=25  and the  profit rate=25  p.c. Let  us take another industry 
where  the  proportion  is C 70, V 30,  hence  the  product=115, 
the profit rate=15  p.c.  Finally,  an  industry where  the 
composition=C  90, V 10,  hence  the  product =105  and the  profit 
rate = 5 p.c. 
Here, given equal exploitation  of  labour,  we  have  IN DIFFÉRENT TRADES 
Very DIFFERENT AMOUNTS  OF  SURPLUS VALUE  AND  HENCE VERY DIFFERENT' RATES  OF 
PROFIT  for  capitals  of equal size. 
If, however,  the  above  4 capitals  are  taken together,  we get: 
Value 
of the product 
1. C 80 V 20 110 profit rate=10  p.c. Rate of surplus 
2. C 50 V 50 125 profit rate=25  p.c. value  in all 
3. C 70 V 30 115 profit rate=15  p.c. cases=50  p.c. 
4. C 90 V 10 105 profit rate=  5 p.c. 
Capital 400 Profits 55 
16—558 

=====第432页=====
396 232. Marx  to Engels.  2 August  1862 
On 100,  this makes  a PROFIT RATE  of 13% p.c. 
If the  total capital  (400)  of the  class  be considered,  the  profit rate 
would=133/4  p.c. And  capitalists  are  brothers.  As a  result  of 
competition  (TRANSFER  OF CAPITAL  OR  WITHDRAWAL OF CAPITAL FROM ONE TRADE 
TO THE  OTHER),  capitals  of  equal size  in  DIFFERENT  TRADES, DESPITE THEIR 
DIFFERENT OGRANIC COMPOSITIONS, YIELD  THE  SAME  AVERAGE RATE  OF  PROFIT.  In 
other words,  the  AVERAGE  profit, which  F.I. A CAPITAL OF  £100  yields  IN A 
CERTAIN TRADE,  it yields,  not as  a capital specifically applied  to the  same 
nor, therefore,  in the proportion  in which  it of itself produces  SURPLUS 
VALUE,  but as an  aliquot part  of the total capital  of the capitalist class.  It 
is a SHARE  the  dividend  on  which will  be paid  in proportion  to its  size 
out of the  total amount  of the  SURPLUS VALUE  (or  unpaid labour) 
produced  by the  total variable (laid  out in  wages) capital  of 
the class. 
If then  1, 2, 3, 4 in the  above illustration  are to  make  the  same 
AVERAGE  PROFIT,  each category must sell  its  goods  at £113'/3-  1 and 
4 will sell them  at more than their value,  2 and 3 at  less. 
The price so regulated=THE  EXPENSES  OF CAPITAL+THE AVERAGE PROFIT 
(F.I. 10  p.c.),  is what Smith called  the  NATURAL  PRICE,  COST  PRICE, 448 etc. 
It is the  AVERAGE  PRICE  to which competition between  DIFFERENT TRADES 
(by TRANSFER OF CAPITAL  or WITHDRAWAL OF CAPITAL)  reduces the prices in 
DIFFERENT TRADES.  Hence, competition reduces commodities  not to 
their value,  but to the  cost price, which, depending  on the  organic 
composition  of the  respective capitals,  is either above, below  or = to 
their values. 
Ricardo confuses value  and  cost price.  He  therefore believes that, 
if there were such  a thing  as absolute rent (i.e., rent independent  of 
variations  in the  fertility  of the  soil),  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE,  etc., 
would  be  constantly sold  for  more than  its  value, because  at more 
than cost price  (THE  ADVANCED  CAPITAL+THE  AVERAGE  PROFIT).  That would 
demolish  the  fundamental  law.  Hence  he  denies absolute rent  and 
assumes only differential rent. 
But his identification of  VALUES  OF COMMODITIES  and  COST PRICES  OF 
COMMODITIES  is totally wrong  and has  traditionally been taken over 
from  A.  Smith. 
The facts  are as  follows: 
If we  assume that  the  AVERAGE COMPOSITION  of all  NOT  AGRICULTURAL 
CAPITAL  is C 80, V 20,  then  the  product (assuming that  the  rate of 
surplus value  is 50  p.c.)=110  and the  profit rate=10  p.c. 
If we  further assume that  the  AVERAGE COMPOSITION  of AGRICULTURAL 
CAPITAL  is C 60, V 40 (in  England, this figure  is statistically fairly 
correct; rent  for  pasture,  etc., has .no  bearing  on  this question, 
being determined  not by  itself,  but by the  CORN RENT),  then  the 

=====第433页=====
232. Marx  to Engels.  2 August  1862 397 
product, given equal exploitation  of labour  as above =120  and 
profit rate=20  p.c.  Hence,  if the  farmer sells  his  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE 
for what  it is  worth,  he is  selling  it at 120 and not at 110, its  cost price. 
But landed property prevents  the  farmer, like  his  BROTHER CAPITALISTS, 
from equalising  the  value  of the  product  to the  cost price. 
Competition between capitals cannot enforce this.  The 
landowner intervenes  and  pockets  the  difference between value  and 
cost price.  A low  proportion  of constant  to variable capital  is in 
general  an expression  of the  poor  (or  relatively poor) development 
of the  productive power  of  labour  in a  particular sphere  of 
production.  Hence,  if the  AVERAGE COMPOSITION  of AGRICULTURAL CAPITAL 
is e.g. C 60, V 40, while that of  NOT  AGRICULTURAL  CAPITAL  is C 80, 
V 20,  this proves that agriculture  has not yet  reached  the  same 
stage  of development  as industry. (Which  is easily explicable since, 
apart from anything else,  a prerequisite  for  industry  is the  older 
science  of mechanics, while  the  prerequisites  for  agriculture  are the 
completely  new  sciences  of chemistry, geology  and  physiology.)  If 
the proportion  in agriculture becomes  C 80, V 20 (in the  above 
premise), then absolute rent disappears.  All  that remains  is 
differential rent, which  I shall also expound  in such  a way as to 
make Ricardo's assumption  of the  constant  DETERIORATION OF AGRICUL­
TURE  appear  MOST  RIDICULOUS AND ARBITRARY. 
Having regard  to the  foregoing definition  of COST  PRICE  as distinct 
from  VALUE,  it should further  be noted that, besides  the  distinction 
between constant capital  and  variable capital, which arises  out of the 
immediate production process  of capital, there  is the  further distinction 
between fixed  and  circulating capital, which arises  out of the  circulation 
process  of capital. However,  the  formula would become  too  involved 
if I were  to seek  to incorporate this  in the  above  as well. 
There  you  have—ROUGHLY,  for the  thing's fairly complicated— 
the critique  of Ricardo's theory. This much  you  will admit—that 
by taking into account the  ORGANIC  COMPOSITION  OF CAPITAL,  one disposes 
of a mass  of what have  so far  seemed  to be  contradictions  and 
problems. 
Apropos. There  are  certain reasons,  of which  I shall inform  you 
in my  next letter,  why I  should  be very glad  if you  would write 
me a detailed military critique  (I shall deal with  the  political 
aspect)  of Lassalle-Rüstow's liberation nonsense. 3

Regards  to the  ladies. 
Imandt  has  announced  himself.  Izzy leaves  on  Monday. 
It will  be evident  to you  that, given  my  view  of 'absolute rent', 
landed property  (UNDER CERTAIN HISTORICAL  CIRCUMSTANCES)  does  INDEED  put 
up the  prices  of raw  materials. Very important, communistically 
speaking. 
Assuming  the  correctness  of the  above view,  it is by no  means 
essential  for  absolute rent  to be  paid under  all  circumstances  or in 
respect  of every type  of soil (even  if the  composition  of  AGRICULTURAL 
CAPITAL  is as  assumed above).  It is not  paid when landed property 
does  not  exist, either factually  or legally.  In such  a case,  AGRICULTURE 
offers  NO  PECULIAR RESISTANCE  TO  THE  APPLICATION  OF CAPITAL,  which then 
moves  as easily  in this element  as in the  other.  The  agricultural 
produce  is then sold,  as masses  of industrial products always  are, 
at cost price  for  less than  its  value.  In practice, landed property  may 
disappear, even when capitalist  and  landowner  are one and the 
same person,  etc. 
But it would  be  otiose  to go  into these details here. 
Differential rent  as  such—which does  not  arise from  the 
circumstance that  CAPITAL  is employed ON  LAND INSTEAD  OF ANY  OTHER 
FIELD  OF EMPLOYMENT—presents  no  difficulty  in theory.  It is  nothing 
other than  SURPLUS PROFIT  which also exists  in  every sphere  of 
industrial production wherever capital operates under better than 
AVERAGE CONDITIONS.  It is  firmly ensconced  in agriculture only because 
founded  on a  basis  as solid  and  (relatively) stable  as the  DIFFERENT 
DEGREES  OF NATURAL FERTILITY  of  VaHOUS types  of  SOÜ.

MARX TO ENGELS 369 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 7 August [1862] 
Dear Engels, 
The LANDLORD came to see me on Monday" and told me that, 
after having foreborne so long, he would hand things over to his 
LAND  AGENT, unless I paid him within the shortest possible time. And 
that means putting the BROKER in. I likewise—oddly enough on the 
same day—got a final demand for the rates, as well as letters from 
the épiciers? most of them acquainted with the LANDLORD, threaten­
ing to prosecute me and withhold  PROVISIONS. 
Lassalle left on Monday evening. I saw him once more after all 
these EVENTS had taken place. From my DEJECTED air, he saw that the 
crisis,  which he had long known about, had led to a catastrophe  OF 
SOME kind. Questioned me. Having heard my tale, he said he could 
let me have £15 by 1 January 1863; also that bills could be drawn 
on him for any desired AMOUNT, provided payment over and above 
the £15 were promised by you or someone else. More he could [not] 
do, he said, in view of his straitened circumstances. (That I can well 
believe, for, while here, he spent £1 2/- daily on  CABS  and cigars 
alone.) 
Might you perhaps be able to do something in this way, using 
Borkheim as escompteur? so as to stave off the crisis? Of the £10, I 
paid 6 to the piano man, a nasty brute who wouldn't have 
hesitated to bring me before the COUNTY COURT. 7 With 2 of the 
pounds I redeemed things that were in pawn and put what was 
left at my wife's disposal. 
I assure you that if it wasn't for FAMILY DIFFICULTIES, I would far 
rather move into a  MODEL  LODGING-HOUSE than be constantly squeezing 
your purse. 
There is, in addition, another circumstance, namely Dr Allen's 
telling me that it's absolutely essential for little Jenny to spend at 
least a fortnight at the seaside, ditto for our youngest d who had 
jaundice of sorne kind last year and isn't ALL RIGHT once again. 
Izzy also told me that he would perhaps found a paper when he 
returned in September. I told him that, if he paid well, I would be

RESPONSIBILITY  or political  PARTNERSHIP,  since all we had in common 
politically were  a few  remote objectives. 
I don't quite share your views on the  AMERICAN  CIVIL  WAR,3  I do not 
believe  THAT ALL IS UP.  From  the  outset,  the  NORTHERNERS  have been 
dominated by the representatives of the  BORDER  SLAVE  STATES, 1' who were 
also responsible  for  pushing McClellan, that  old  PARTISAN  OK 
Breckinridge,  to the top. The  South,  on the  other hand, acted  as 
a single whole right from  the  very start.  The  North itself turned 
slavery into  a pro-  instead  of an  anti-Southern military  FORCE.  The 
South leaves  PRODUCTIVE LABOUR  to the  slaves  and  could thus take  the 
field undisturbed with  its  fighting force intact.  It had a  unified 
military leadership;  the  North  did  not.  That there  was  no strategical 
plan is evident  if only from  the  manoeuvrings  of the Kentucky Army 
after  the  capture  of Tennessee.  In my  view,  all this is going  to TAKE 
ANOTHER TURN.  The  North will,  at last, wage  the  war in earnest, have 
recourse  to revolutionary methods  and  overthrow  the  supremacy  of 
the BORDER SLAVE STATESMEN.  One single  NIGGER REGIMENT  would have a 
remarkable effect  on  Southern nerves. 
The difficulty  of  raising 300,000  men is, I  should  say,  purely 
political.  The  North-West  and New  England449 wish  to and  will 
compel  the  government  to abandon  the  diplomatic warfare they 
have waged hitherto, and are now making  TERMS  ON  WHICH  THE 
300,000  MEN SHALL COME EORTH.  If Lincoln doesn't give way (which he 
will, however), there'll  be a  revolution. 
As regards  the  lack  of military talent,  the  choice  of generals, 
hitherto dependent purely  on  diplomatic  and  party chicanery,  has 
hardly been calculated  to bring  it to the  fore. However,  I should 
say that General Pope  was a man of  energy. 
As for  financial measures, they  are  clumsy  as,  indeed, they  are 
bound  to be in a  country* where  IN FACT  taxation  has  hitherto been 
non-existent  (so far as the  country  as a  whole  is concerned),  but 
not nearly  as silly  as the  measures taken  by  Pitt et cie?° 0 I should 
say that  the  present depreciation  of money  is attributable  not to 
economic,  but to  purely political grounds, namely  DISTRUST.  It will 
therefore change, when policy changes. 
The long  and the  short  of it is, I  think, that wars  of this kind 
ought  to be  conducted along .revolutionary lines,  and the 
YANKEES"2  have  so far  been trying  to conduct  it along constitu­
tional ones.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 8 August 1862 
Dear Moor, 
In giving you an account of my expenditure, I never remotely 
intended to deter you from further 'squeezing', as you call it. On 
the contrary, we shall, I think, go on giving each other as much 
mutual aid as we can, it being quite immaterial so far as the cause 
is concerned which of us happens to be the 'squeezer' at the 
moment and which the 'squeezed', roles that are, after all, 
interchangeable. My only object in drawing up this statement was 
to demonstrate the impossibility of laying my hands on more than 
£10 just at the moment. 
I assume that you promptly requisitioned the £15 in cash from 
Lassalle, or what exactly does 'by January' 3 mean? That he doesn't 
want to fork out till then? Now as regards bills, I for my part can 
perfectly well draw from £40 à £45 or some 260 to 300 talers on 
Lassalle, at 3, preferably 4 months' date, provided Borkheim will 
cash them. I shall also be able to send you another £10 in cash if I 
keep Borkheim waiting till September for the money I owe him 
for wine. That would make 10 from me, 45 for the bill, 15 
Lassalle, total £70. But it would mean that I was completely 
cleaned out for some little while, not that that would really matter, 
provided it got you out of the mire and enabled little Jenny to go 
to the SEASIDE. Since Borkheim is constantly having to disburse 
money on the Continent—and he knows that, come what may, I 
have got to honour the bill if I don't want my position here to be 
ruined, there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't go and ask 
him whether he's willing to negotiate the thing for us. You can tell

him that just now, when times are bad for COTTON, I am 
honour-bound to draw as little money as possible from the firm 
and hence would sooner adopt this method. You have far less 
cause to feel ill at ease with him about the affair than I have, so go 
and see him at once and arrange matters so that I can draw on 
Monsieur le Baron 2 forthwith. 
Lupus arrived on Monday, in the grip of influenza and 
rheumatism, which confined him to bed for a day, the only one he 
spent in London. As soon as he felt a little better, he came straight 
up here. That was why he didn't come and see you. He is now 
better, but, being in monetibus'' likewise on his beam ends, came 
straight to me about the £10. 
You've absolutely got to pull off another financial coup, 
otherwise I cannot see how on earth we're going to make up for 
the loss of the Tribune. Nor are the other New York papers in any 
kind of a position to take the place of the Tribune so far as you 
are concerned  ' ; but, should a suitable occasion arise, it would do 
no harm to try, as something might come of it. With 30 sheets, the 
book310  will raise at most some £70, but how do things stand with 
Brockhaus? Did you discuss the matter at all with Lassalle? And 
how much longer will it take? 
I have again made contact with the Allgemeine Militär-Zeitung 
and shall see how it goes, though 1 article every 6 weeks is the 
maximum here. Mightn't you be able, through your mussurus d or 
otherwise, to arrange for me to contribute military articles to an 
English paper in London? But all this is marginal stuff and, unless 
we can discover the art of shitting gold, there would hardly seem 
to be any alternative to your extracting something from your 
relations by one means or another. Réfléchis-là-dessus. e 
Shall write to you shortly about Lassalle's war plans and your 
theory of rent,f though I must say I'm by no means clear about 
the existence of 'absolute' rent—for, after all, you have to prove it 
first. I've got frightful piles and can't go on sitting down any 
longer.

MARX TO ENGELS' 69 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 9 August 1862 
Dear Engels, 
Izzy doesn't want to pay the £15 before 1 January.'' 
So, I've been to see Borkheim. You are to draw 400 talers on 
Lassalle (I didn't, of course, in speaking of Lassalle to Borkheim, 
say anything  AS TO THE £15 to be paid by Lassalle). At 3 months. 
Then, however, the thing will have to be renewed, as I told 
Borkheim that it wasn't payable until 1 January. (This being the 
date stipulated by Lassalle.) 
So, the main thing is that you should send Borkheim the bill. 
As regards the theory of rent, I shall, of course, have to wait until 
I get your letter.b  But what follows will simplify the 'debate', as 
Heinrich Bürgers would say: 
I. All I have to prove theoretically is the possibility of absolute 
rent, without infringing the law of value. This is the point round 
which the theoretical controversy has revolved from the time of the 
physiocrats4r>1  until the present day. Ricardo denies that possibility; 
I maintain it. I likewise maintain that his denial rests on a 
theoretically false dogma deriving from A. Smith—the supposed 
identity of  COST  I-KICFS'  and  Y.M.VES  OF COMMOMFIFS.  Further, that where 
Ricardo illustrates the thing with examples, he invariably presup­
poses conditions in which there is either no capitalist production 
or (factually or legally) no landed property. But the whole point is to 
examine the law precisely when such things do exist. 
II. As regards the existence of absolute rent, this would be a 
question that would require statistical solution in any country. But 
the importance of a purely theoretical solution may be gauged 
from the fact that for 35 years statisticians and practical men 
generally have been maintaining the existence of absolute rent, 
while the (Ricardian) theoreticians have been seeking to explain it 
away by dint of very forced and theoretically feeble abstractions. 
Hitherto, I have invariably found that, in all such QUARRELS, the 
theoreticians have always been in the wrong.

III. I demonstrate that, even presupposing the existence of 
absolute rent, it by no means follows that the worst cultivated land 
or the worst mine pays rent UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES; rather, these 
will, in all likelihood, have to sell their products at market value, 
but at less than their individual value. In order to prove the 
opposite, Ricardo invariably supposes—which is theoretically 
false—that, UNDER ALL CONDITIONS OF THE MARKET, it is the commodity 
produced in the most unfavourable circumstances which determines 
the market value. You yourself had already put forward the 
correct argument against this in the Deutsch-Französische 
Jahrbücher.  * 
That is all I have to add as to rent. 
As regards Brockhaus, Lassalle has promised to do his utmost b 
and I believe he will, having solemnly declared that he can neither 
publish his magnum opus on political economy, nor set to work on 
it—which in his case amounts to the same thing—until my 
book310 has come out. 
Salut. Your 
K. M. Borkheim further adds: 
You are to draw the 400 talers on Lassalle at 3 months and 
renew it a fortnight before due date, till 1 January 1863. If you 
can't manage to pay in instalments, Borkheim will see to it that 
Lassalle gets the money on the first due date. 
As for the Evening Post,' I should be glad if you could draft a 
letter for me, since I'm very bad at writing colloquial English.

I am unable to answer the preceding letter, since I don't know

introducing inconsistencies into the affair. I could, of course, only 
assume Lassalle was back in Berlin. You should now go straight to

Lassalle for acceptance. Otherwise, of course, nothing at all can be 
done. How this misunderstanding could have arisen I fail to

before due date. Then the bill will be renewed until 1st January, 
when Engels will send you 300 talers and you, in accordance with 
your promise, will yourself pay 100. 
All you have to do for the time being is to accept the bill drawn 
by Engels. ALTOGETHER, this amounts to £60 and hence doesn't help

repeat the brief purport of the brief lines which may, perhaps, not

In order to stave off the catastrophe threatening my affairs, 
Engels drew a bill on you for £60 (400 talers) through Borkheim

discount this bill for me here. Engels will remit you the covering

1 January 1863, when  he will send  you a  further remittance  of £45 
and you  will  pay £15, as you  offered  to do.) The  only essential 
thing  now is to  have your acceptance. Borkheim sent  the  bill straight 
off to Berlin, whence  it will return probably before  the end of  this 
week  or early  in the  next. Then  it will  at once  be sent  to you for 
acceptance.  I should  be  very glad  if you  could telegraph 
S. L. Borkheim,  27  Crutched Friars, London, saying:  'I SHALL ACCEPT 
MR F. ENGELS' BILL  OF £60.' Namely, so that Borkheim should not 
raise  any  further difficulties about  the  DISCOUNT.  In my  case, there 
is greater periculum  in  mora' 1 than  I can say.

Dear Frederick, 
Just a few  lines  as I  have  a mass  of business errands  to run 
today. 
The misunderstanding consists solely  in there  'not  having been 
one'. 
Before writing  to you, I had  told Borkheim that  I did not  know 
whether Lassalle  was in Berlin,  and  hence that there  was no 
certainty  of an  immediate acceptance. Borkheim had, nevertheless, 
promised  to  DISCOUNT  the  moment  he had  your signature.  He 
subsequently thought better  of it. 
He decided,  not to  DISCOUNT  in person,  as he had  originally 
intended,  BUT TO  HAVE  THE  BILL DISCOUNTED  BY ONE OF HIS  FRIENDS CONNECTED 
WITH BERLIN.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 239 
IN ZURICH 
London, 20 August [1862] 
Dear Lassalle, 
I imagine that, excursions into the High Alps and Italy 
notwithstanding, you will be spending a few days in Zurich, or at 
least receiving poste restante letters there. To make doubly sure, I 
have also informed Mr Rüstow that I have written to you 'poste 
restante Zurich'. 
Despite the 'position' I am in, I would rescind the whole 
transaction if the bill on you were not already in the hands of 
'Meyer Brothers', Berlin. Actually, this was not altogether in 
accordance with the agreement, since Borkheim had originally 
promised me he wouldn't let the bill out of his hands until you 
returned to Berlin. However, I couldn't see that any harm had 
been done since, in the case of this first bill, I had thought the use 
of your name was a mere formality and had no idea it had any 
connection with your 'public existence' or might serve to spark off 
some civil drama or other. For I believed that Engels' security for 
'an amount' of 400 talers would meet the case, even if the 'worst 
came to the worst' and, as regards 'the due date', I knew Engels to 
be a model of 'punctuality and promptitude' in money matters, 
particularly where bills are concerned. Otherwise, I wouldn't have 
involved you in this BUSINESS. 
It being no longer possible to rescind the thing without making 
myself and Engels look foolish in Borkheim's eyes, I shall send 
you Engels' bond the day after tomorrow." For it takes 3 days to 
get a reply from Manchester. As soon as you have the same, it would 
be good if you wrote to 'Meyer Brothers' (this being the name of the 
firm in Berlin which has Engels' draft), telling them you will 
accept on your return. 
Let me say once again how much I regret having involved you 
in the matter—a rash act for which the overlooking of certain 
premises on your part and mine is to blame. Meanwhile, I remain,

promised to discount the bill (out of his own pocket). He did so, 
knowing that Lassalle's acceptance wasn't to be had for some little 
while. Then, without a word to me, he sent it through Bruckner 
(Brothers) to Berlin so as to get it discounted by the said 
Brückners. Perhaps—he pretends to have forgotten how it all 
began—he took fright in the meantime. 
Secondly: Baron Artful,b with whom I discussed the transaction 
on the eve of his departure' when he declared himself 'prepared 
to do anything', writes today from Wildbad4'4 whither I had sent 
him an advice'1: 
'If I am to accept, I shall have to have a bond from Engels himself in which he 
undertakes to put me in possession of the covering amount a week before due date. 
Not, of course, (!) that I doubt you wrote at his behest, but simply because, if I 
have to accept a bill which I cannot meet myself I must, if unforeseen 
circumstances are to be precluded and the worst comes to the worst, at least possess 
a personal written undertaking from the man who can and is to send me this 
remittance.' 
I thereupon wrote the baron, who is now in Zurich (has left 
Wildbad) and 'may' be going on to Italy in a few days' time, a 
very ironical letter,e telling him that I would forthwith request you 
to send the bond to me. This I now do. 
Yesterday Borkheim read me his letter to you. 4''5 I'd be very 
glad if you would write to him privately saying he should do 
everything possible to obtain the money for me, since I am (and 
this is true) in dire need, while Lassalle's return will be delayed by 
his adventures abroad. 
(By the by, I wrote and told Izzyf that, on receipt of your bond, 
he should write to 'Meyer' Brothers in Berlin, who have the bill, 
a after the event - '' Ferdinand Lassalle - ' See this volume, p. 399. - d ibid.,

saying  he will accept  it on his  return—if, that  is, he's not  going  to 
be long enough  in any one  place  for the  bill to be  sent  on for his 
acceptance.) 
Say what  you  will,  DEAR BOY,  it really  is embarrassing  to have  to 
BOFHKR  you as I do  with  my  misèresl  If only  I knew  how to  start 
some sort  of  BUSINESS!  All  theory, dear friend,  is grey,  and  only 
BUSINESS  green.' 1 Unfortunately,  I have come  to realise this  too  late. 
With  the £20  advanced  by Borkheim,  I first  of all  paid  the  rates, 
then  the  shoemaker  who was  proposing  to sue me, etc. I  used  £5 
to send  my  FAMILY  to Ramsgate yesterday, since little Jenny could 
not remain here  any  longer.  I cannot thank  you  enough  for 
having made this possible. She's  the  most perfect  and  gifted child 
in the  world.  But  here  she had to  suffer twice over. Firstly from 
physical causes.  And  then  she was  afflicted  by our  pecuniary 
TROUBLE.  How  glad  I was  today that  my  wife  and  children were 
away  and  were thus spared  the  sight  of Izzy's letter! 
Can't  you  come down  for a few  days?  In my  critique  I have 
demolished  so  much  of the old  stuff that there  are a  number  of 
points  I should like  to consult  you  about before  I proceed."" 
Discussing these matters  in writing  is tedious both  for you and for 
me. 
One point about which  you, as a  practical  man,  must have  the 
answer,  is this.  Let us  assume that  a firm's machinery  at the 
outset=£12,000.  It wears  out  ON AN  AVERAGE  in 12  years.  If then 
£1,000  is added  to the  value  of the  goods every year, the cost  of 
the machinery will have been paid  off in 12  years. Thus  far, 
A. Smith and all his successors. But,  IN FACT,  this is only an  AVERAGE 
CALCULATION.  Much  the  same applies  to machinery having  a life of 
12 years  as, say, to a  horse with  a life—or useful life—of  10  years. 
Although  it would have  to be  replaced with  a new  horse after  10 
years,  it would  in  practice  be  wrong  to say  that  l/]H of it  died 
every year. Rather,  in a  letter  to  FACTORY INSPECTORS,1'  Mr  Nasmyth 
observes that machinery  (at  least some types  of machinery)  RUNS 
BETTER  in the second year  THAN  IN THE FIRST.  AT  ALL EVENTS,  in the course 
of those  12  years does  not {/V2  of the  machinery have  to be 
replaced  in natura' each year?  Now,  what becomes  of this fund, 
which yearly replaces  Via of the  machinery?  Is it not, in  fact,  an 
accumulation fund  to  extend reproduction aside from  any

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 9 September 1862 
Dear Moor, 
You have no idea how I've had to buckle to during the past few 
days.  Cotton, blast it, has risen fivefold on average, and you really 
wouldn't believe how much work is involved in keeping all the 
customers informed of these successive increases. 
I trust the Lassalliad over that wretched bill has been cleared up 
and that you're in possession of the money. I've at last reached a 
point at which I can go to Germany for a fortnight, leaving on 
Friday4"; unfortunately, I won't be able to stop in London as the 
time at my disposal is very short and everything I've heard about 
that idiotic exhibition344 has made me hate it so much that I'm 
downright glad I shan't be seeing it. But drop me another line to 
say how things went with the bill and how little Jenny is getting 
on — before I leave. 
What with the cotton pother, the theory of renta has really 
proved too abstract for me. I shall have to consider the thing 
when I eventually get a little more peace and quiet. Likewise the 
question of wear and tear1' where, however, I rather suspect you 
have gone off the rails. Depreciation time is not, of course, the 
same for all machines. But more about this when I get back. 
Individual chaps up here have made a hell of a lot of money 
during this rise. None of it will stick to ourselves, partly because 
the good Gottfried' is indeed a breech-wetter and partly because 
spinners in general haven't made a sou during this period. It's all 
gone into the pockets of the commission houses. 
The Bull Run affair No. II was a splendid little show by 
S ro\h\vAi  i. Jackson who is by far the best chap America has. Had he 
been supported on his front by an attack on the part of the main 
Confederate army, and had everything gone right (or only 
partially so), then Monsieur Pope would doubtless have been done 
for. 4,s But as it was, the affair came to nothing, save that the 
Confederates gained an important moral advantage—respect for 
their spirit of enterprise and for Jackson—and a few square miles

of ground; on the other hand, however, they have speeded up the 
unification and concentration of the entire Federal army before 
Washington. The next STEAMER will most probably bring us news of 
fresh engagements, in which the Federals might well be victorious 
if their generals weren't so bloody stupid. But what can you expect 
of such rapscallions! Pope is the lousiest of the lot; all he can do is 
brag, countermand, lie, and keep quiet about his reverses. Indeed, 
that know-all of the General  Staff,  McClellan, now strikes one yet 
again as being positively intelligent. What is more, the order that 
all future major-generals are to sit the exam for the Prussian 
ensign's sword-knot.459 It's too pitiful and, in contrast to the 
spineless goings-on in the North, the chaps in the South, who,' at 
least, know what they want, seem to me like heroes. Or do you still 
believe that the gentlemen of the North will suppress the 
'REBELLION'?

Dear Engels, 
My FAMILY has got back from Ramsgate; little Jenny is very much 
better. 
Lassalle's letter, containing a letter for Meyer Brothers with 
whom the bill is lodged in Berlin, and also his acceptance, didn't 
arrive till yesterday. In the meantime, Borkheim had already gone 
away on holiday. Up till now he has paid £40 in driblets, the last 
15 of the 40 thirteen days ago, when I was leaving? 60 For I wanted 
to pester my uncle." But he, too, was travelling on the Continent.

From there (passant  par  COLOGNE.,  etc.) I  went  to Trier  to see my 
mater—fruitlessly, however,  as I at  once suspected when Monsieur 
l'oncle  was not to be got  hold  of. On the 17th of  this month,  I 
have  to pay a  bill  [of  exchange]  for £6 (six  POUNDS)  to my  butcher, 
and Borkheim won't have  got  back  by then,  his  intention being  to 
spend  ABOUT  4 WEEKS  bustling round Switzerland,  etc. 
As to the  YANKEES,312  I am  firmly  of the  opinion,  now as  before, 
that the  North will  win in the end";  true,  the  Civil  War may  pass 
through  all  kinds  of episodes, perhaps even ceasefires,  and be 
long-drawn-out.  The  South would  or could conclude peace only 
on condition that it gained possession of the  BORDER SLAVE STATES.''  In 
that case, California would also fall  to it, the  North-West would 
follow suit  and the  entire Federation, with  the  exception, perhaps, 
of the  NEW  ENGLAND STATES,44"  would again form  one  country, this 
time under the  ACKNOWLEDGED SUPREMACY OF THE SLAVEHOLDERS.  It would 
be the  reconstruction  of the  UNITED STATES  on the  basis demanded 
by the  South.  But  that  is impossible  and  won't happen. 
The North,  for its  part,  can  conclude peace only  if the 
CONFEDERACY  is restricted  to the old  slave states,  and  then only  to 
those bounded  by the  Mississippi  RIVER  and the  ATLANTIC.  In which 
case the  CONFEDERACY  would soon come  to a  happy  end. In the 
intervening period, ceasefires,  etc., on the  basis  of a  status  quo 
could  at most occasion pauses  in the  course  of the war. 
The way in  which  the  North  \s waging  the war is  none other 
than might  be expected  of a  bourgeois republic, where humbug  has 
reigned supreme  for so  long.  The  South,  an oligarchy,  is better 
suited  to the  purpose, especially  an oligarchy where  all productive 
labour devolves  on the  NIGGERS  and  where  the 4  million  'WHITE 
TRASH'418  are  flibustiers^  by calling.  For all  that,  I'm  prepared  to bet 
my life  on it  that these fellows will come  off  worst,  'STONEWALL 
Jackson' notwithstanding.  It is, of  course, possible that some sort 
of revolution will occur beforehand  in the  North  itself. 
Willich  is a brigadier-general  and  Stephens,' 1 or so  Kapp told me 
in Cologne,  is also said  to be on his way to the  wars  now. 
It strikes  me  that  you  allow yourself  to be  influenced  by the 
military  ASPECT  of things  A LITTLE TOO MUCH. 
As to the  economic  stuff, I  don't propose  to burden  you  with  it 
on your journev.''

Manchester, 16 October 1862 
Dear Moor, 
Every single day throughout the whole of last week and this, I 
was all-set to write to you, but was prevented from doing so by the 
confounded COTTON business. Ces messieurs" had, of course, done as 
little work as possible while I was away, 457 so that my hands have 
been completely full. 
Lupus asked me to tell you that he got the things all right.h The 
case is a most amusing one. Those poor, mendacious Prussians! 
They invariably make fools of themselves the moment they 
commit something to paper! 
I presume you got the £10 note I sent you on the day of my 
departure? Again I got stuck in Barmen and Engelskirchen for 
too long, having spent a whole fortnight sauntering along the 
Moselle, the Rhine, and in Thuringia. I went straight to Trier via 
Brussels and Luxemburg, and then on foot to Kochern, etc., giving 
Cologne a complete miss. 
Bismarck's appointment was hailed by the bourgeois with peals 
of laughter.4M The chaps were altogether amazingly confident and 
in a somewhat daredevil mood. They have at last hooked the 
worthy William with a financial question and know he's bound to 
give way to them in the long run; but they take a remarkably 
idyllic view of the course of events and imagine that, provided 
they just keep the fellow dangling for a while, he'll come to them 
of his own accord. They're in for a surprise. At all events, things 
are bound to come to a head some time in the spring. It's killing, 
by the by, to see what an inspiring effect a financial question of 
this kind has on the philistines. Schulze-Delitzsch and co. become 
positively witty, the only man to remain 'sherioush'r  being 
Virchow; but nay, he is not alone— Heinrich Bürgers, too, 
conducts himself with fitting dignity in Weimar, where he sounds 
the trumpet on behalf of the Imperial Constitution of the year 
dot. 464 I .must say that Schulze-Delitzsch, the little provident society

man who has never been, nor asked to be, more than a wretched 
philistine, seems to me positively respectable by comparison with 
scoundrels such as Bürgers and the great Miquel, who are saving 
the fatherland in Weimar through Prussian supremacy. 465 
I now understand about Kinkel, too. He's a complete caricature 
of a certain upholsterer in Coblenz who is, in his own way, a 
unique example of a Rhinelander, with all the prejudices and 
narrow-mindedness of a race that curses the Prussians, loathes the 
French, sympathises with Austria, is Catholic and democratic in 
one and the same breath, but excels at putting its best foot 
forward. I know because we marched over the Kochemer Berg 
together. If Kinkel were to see this lad, whom his physical 
appearance apes iri every particular, the shock would knock him 
over backwards. 
What do you make of America? The financial CRASH, inevitable 
in view of these stupid paper money measures, would seem to be 
imminent.422 Militarily speaking, the North may now perhaps begin 
to recover a bit. 
What is little Jenny doing?

him personally  at his  Berlin address,  13  Bellevuestrasse. This 
month,  he is  being taken  to court  on  account  of one  of his famous 
speeches.46" 
Schily  was  here  for a  week, looking very wretched  and ill, 
whereas  his  friend Imandt,  who was  also here before  I left  for 
Holland  and  Trier, 4'* has  grown frightfully obese.  It's  almost  as 
though  a second back  had  formed  on top of his old one. 
As regards America,  I believe  the  Maryland campaign467  to be 
decisive  in as  much  as it has  shown that even  in  this most 
Southern-minded part  of the  BORDER STATES11  there  is little support 
for the  CONFEDERATES.  But the  whole struggle revolves round  the 
BORDER  STATES.  Whoever has those, will dominate the  UMCN.  The fact 
that Lincoln promulgated  the  PROSPECTIVE  emancipation decree  at a 
time when  the  CONFEDERATES  were advancing into Kentucky also 
shows that  no  further consideration  is now  being shown  the  LOYAL 
SLAVE  HOLDERS  in the  BORDER sIAIES. 468 The southward migration of 
slave holders with their  BLACK CHATTEL  from Missouri, Kentucky,  and 
Tennessee  has  already assumed vast proportions  and if, as is 
certain,  the  struggle goes  on a bit  longer,  the  South will have lost 
all support there.  It was the  South that began  the  struggle  for the 
territories. 440 The war  itself  has  been instrumental  in destroying  its 
power in the  BORDER  SLATES,  which, in the absence of any market for 
the BREEDING  OF  SLAVES  or the  INTERNAL SLAVE TRADE,  have been daily 
loosening their ties with  the  South anyhow.  In my  opinion, 
therefore,  the  sole concern  of the  South will  now be  defence.  But 
its only chance  of  success  lay in an  offensive.  If  there  is 
confirmation  of the  news that Hooker  is to be  given active 
command  of the  Potomac Army, McClellan  to be  'withdrawn'  to 
the 'theoretical' post of  COMMANDER  IN CHIEF  and Halleck to assume 
supreme command  in the  West,  the  conduct  of the war in  Virginia 
might take  on a  more energetic character. Moreover,  the  most 
favourable time of year for the  CONFEDERATES  is now  GONE. 
From  the  point  of view  of morale,  the  failure  of the  Maryland 
campaign  was of  really tremendous importance. 
As regards finance,  the  UNI FED STATES  know from  the  time  of the 
War of  Independence,  as we  know from  our  observation  of 
Austria,  how far one may go  with depreciated paper money. 469 
The fact remains that  the  Yankees have never exported  so much 
grain  to  England  as  this year, that  the  present harvest  is again 
far above  AVEGARE  and  that  the  balance  of trade  has  never been  so 
favourable  for  them  as during  the  past  2 years.  As  soon  as the new

system of taxation (vapid though it is, and truly Pitt-like400) is 
introduced, there will, at last, be a  REII.UX  of paper money, of which 
there has hitherto only been a steady issue. This will render 
unnecessary any increase in the issue of paper on the present 
scale, and further depreciation will thus be CHECKED. What has 
made even the depreciation prevailing up till now less dangerous 
than it would have been in similar circumstances in France, or 
even England, is the fact that the Yankees have never prohibited 
the existence of two prices, a GOLD PRICE and a PAPER PRICE. The 
inherent disadvantage of the thing takes the form of a national 
debt, for which there has never been the appropriate funding, and 
470 
a PREMIUM FOR JOBBING AND SPECULATION. 
When the English boast that their depreciation never exceeded 
11 Va p.c. (according to others it amounted to more than twice that 
figure DURING SOME TIME), they choose to forget that they not only 
continued to pay the old taxes, but every year they paid new ones 
in addition to the old, so that the REFLUX of bank notes was assured 
in advance, whereas the Yankees have in effect conducted the war 
for IV2 years without taxation (except for the greatly reduced 
import duties) simply by means of repeated issues of paper. Such 
procedure, which has now reached a turning-point, means that the 
depreciation is, in fact, still relatively modest. 
The fury with which the Southerners are greeting Lincoln's acts 
is proof of the importance of these measures.4'1 Lincoln's acts all 
have the appearance of inflexible, clause-ridden conditions com­
municated by a lawyer to his opposite number. This does not, 
however, impair their historical import and does, in actual fact, 
amuse me when, on the other hand, I consider the drapery in 
which your FRENCHMAN enwraps the merest trifle. 
Like others, I am of course aware of the distasteful form 
assumed by the movement chez the Yankees; but, having regard to 
the nature of a 'bourgeois' democracy, I find this explicable. 
Nevertheless, events over there are such as to transform the world, 
and nothing in the whole of history is more nauseous than the 
attitude adopted towards them by the English.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 4 November 1862 
Dear Engels, 
I have just been to see Freiligrath. He will send the 400 talers to 
Lassalle. You are to send him £60, and he will then advise you of 
the rate of exchange, etc. 
As to the renewal, there is no difficulty. You can draw for £45 
or ANY SUM  LESS  THAN £60 and send me the bill so that Lassalle can 
endorse it. Once that is done, it is discountable over here. You can 
made it payable at 3 months. For the renewal, however, Lassalle's 
endorsement will be needed and hence cannot be obtained in 
respect of the present payment. Lassalle himself is awaiting this 
renewal, having had my letter. 42 Write and let me know at once 
what is to be done.

Dear Moor, 
The £60 will go off to Freiligrath tomorrow. I can't say what is 
to be done about renewing the bill until I know whether the bill 
will be discountable for certain as soon as Lassalle accepts it, and 
who will attend to the discounting. On the one hand, it would 
serve no purpose to worry Lassalle unduly with bills that would

not bring you in money immediately, and, on the other, it could 
hardly be much use to me if Borkheim (to whom the same 
CONSIDERATIONS apply) sent me the money merely in small DRIBLETS. 
Then there are the expenses. 
Quant à l'Amérique," I, too, of course, believe that the Confeder­
ates in Maryland have suffered an unexpected and very significant 
blow to their morale. b I am also convinced that the definitive 
possession of the BORDER SEMES will decide the outcome of the war.' 
However, I am by no means certain that the affair will develop in 
as classical a form as you seem to imagine. In spite of all the 
hullabaloo raised by the Yankees, there is still no sign whatsoever 
that the people regard the business as being truly a question of 
their national existence. On the contrary, the successes of the 
Democrats at the polls prove that the party that is weary of war is 
growing.472 If only there were some evidence, some indication, that 
the masses in the North were beginning to act as in France in 
1792 and 1793, everything would be splendid. But the only 
revolution to be anticipated seems more likely to be a democratic 
counter-revolution and a hollow peace, which will also divide up 
the BORDER STATES. That this would not settle the affair by a long 
chalk—GRANTED.  But it might do so temporarily. I must confess I 
feel no enthusiasm for a people who, faced with an issue as colossal 
as this, allow themselves to be beaten again and again by a force 
numbering V4 of their own population and who, after 18 months 
of war, have gained nothing save the discovery that all their 
generals are jackasses and the.ir functionaries, crooks and traitors. 
Things must assuredly take a different course, even in a bourgeois 
republic, if it is not to be landed completely in the soup. What you 
say about the iniquitous way the English view the affair 
corresponds entirely to my own opinion. 
The DISTRESS up here is gradually becoming acute. Gumpert tells 
me that the more serious cases of illness in his hospital are all 
characteristic of typhoid and that cases of tuberculosis, whose 
origin can be traced back to the last 8 or 9 months, are rapidly 
increasing. I imagine that by next month the working people 
themselves will have had enough of sitting about with a look of 
passive misery on their faces. 
Kind regards.

Haverstock Hill 
Dear Lassalle, 
Freiligrath is sending you £60 today, this being the covering 
amount for the bill. The renewal of the same, about which I 
advised you when the operation began, will be effected only in so 
far as Borkheim is in receipt of a bill on you from me at 2 months 
after date (dated 6th November, hence payable about 9 January 
1863) for the sum of 100 talers, or £15. 
From the few lines you wrote me from time to time, I can see 
that your rancour persists, as, no doubt, the form of the letters 
was intended to indicate. 
The long and the short of it is that you are both in the right 
and in the wrong. You ask me to send you a copy of the letter you 
wrote from Baden.b For what purpose? So that you could ascertain 
whether your letter mightn't actually have provided a pretext for-
the one I wrote to Zurich?c Granting you all your  POWER  OF ANALYSIS, 
can you, with your eyes, detect what was read by my eyes and, 
more particularly, can you deduce therefrom the conditions under 
which my eyes were reading? In order to prove to me that I had 
misread your words, you would have to equate first the readers 
and then the circumstances of the readers, an equation you would

again tackle as Lassalle under Lassallean conditions and not as 
Marx under Marxian conditions. Hence nothing could come of it 
but fuel for fresh controversy. How little the  POWER  OF ANALYSIS  helps 
in such transactions is evident to me from your letter. For you 
ascribe to me something I didn't mean. Whatever the cir­
cumstances, I myself must be the best judge of the latter. The 
wording of the letter may support your view, but, as to the 
meaning that lay behind the words, I myself am, de prime  abord," 
better informed than you. You hadn't so much as an inkling of 
what had got my back up, namely the impression gained from 
reading your letter (wrongly, as I now discover on re-reading it in a 
more serene frame of mind) that you doubted whether I was acting 
with Engels' consent. I concede that I made no mention of this in 
my letter and that, leaving the personal relationship aside and 
simply having regard to our business relationship, it was an absurd 
supposition. STILL, IT APPEARED  SO TO ME AT THE MOMENT I WROTE TO YOU. I 
further concede that this, my real grievance, was not expressed, 
perhaps not even hinted at, in my letter; rather, the ISSUE has been 
ON A FALSE POINT. Such is the sophistry of all passion. 
So, anyhow, you are in the wrong because of the way you 
interpreted my letter; I am in the wrong because I wrote it and 
supplied the materia peccans.b 
Is there to be an outright split between us because of this? I 
believe that the substance of our friendship is strong enough to 
withstand the SHOCK. I confess to you, sans phrase,c that I, as a man 
on a powder barrel, permitted myself to be swayed by cir­
cumstances in a manner unbecoming to an animal rationale. But, at 
all events, it would be ungenerous of you, as a jurist and 
prosecutor, to hold against me a status animid in which I would 
have liked nothing better than to blow my brains out. 
So, I trust that, 'despite everything',e our old relationship will 
continue untroubled. 
Since that time I have been on the Continent, in Holland, Trier, 
etc., in order to arrange my affairs.460  J'ai abouti à rien. 1

I am impatiently awaiting the STEAMER that will bring us news of 
the New York elections. If the Democrats win in New York State, 
I shan't know what to make of the Yankees any more.473 That a 
people placed in a great historical dilemma,and one, in which its 
very existence is at stake to boot, should turn reactionary en masse 
and vote for abject surrender after 18 months' fighting, is really 
beyond my comprehension. Desirable though it may be, on the 
one hand, that the bourgeois republic should be utterly discredited 
in America too, so that in future it may never again be preached  ON 
ITS OWN  MERirs,but only as a means towards,and a form of transition to, 
social revolution, it is, nevertheless, annoying that a rotten oligarchy, 
with a population only half as large, should evince such strength as 
the great fat, helpless democracy. Should the Democrats win, by the 
way, it will give the worthy McClellan and the WESTPOINTERS 474 a fine 
advantage and the show will soon be over. The fellows are capable of 
concluding peace, should the South agree to rejoin the Union  ON 
CONDITION  that the President shall always be a SOUTHERNER and Congress 
always consist of an equal number of SOUTHERNERS and NORTHERNERS. 
They are even capable of immediately proclaiming Jefferson Davis 
President of the UNITED STATES and actually surrendering all the  BORDER 
STATES, if peace is not to be had otherwise. Then it's goodbye to 
America. 
Besides, the only apparent effect of Lincoln's emancipation 4b8 so 
far is that the North-West has voted Democrat for fear of being 
overrun by Negroes. 
To descend from the sublime to the ridiculous, what do you 
think of worthy William?3 At last the fellow is himself again; he 
has expiated his liberal sins and said 'mater peccavi'b to the crippled 
Elizabeth/ In return for this, the Lord has endowed him with 
strength wherewith to smite the scrofulous mob of liberals475  and 
for that, says William, 'for that I need the military'. So rabid is the 
fellow that even Bismarck is no longer reactionary enough for 
him. That you're a fool, Schapper, we know and you yourself 
know, but that you are such a fool, etc., etc. Things are going 
swimmingly, and what could be better than that, 14 years after 
1848,  the liberal bourgeoisie should have been landed in the most 
extreme revolutionary dilemma, and all because of a miserable 
6 million talers, or about £850,000 sterling? If only the old jackass

Prussians can't be relied on, not even for their stupidity. If things 
go on as they are, a set-to is absolutely inevitable and, when it

Dear Engels, 
Best thanks for the £5. 
It seems to me that you take too one-sided a view of the 
American fracas.3 At the AMERICAN COFFEEHOUSE I have looked 
through a lot of Southern  PAPERS  and from them it is plain that the 
Confederacy is in a very tight corner. The English papers 
suppressed information on the battle of 'Corinth'.476 The Southern 
papers depict it as the most exceptional stroke of ill-luck to have 
befallen them since the call to arms. The State of Georgia has 
declared the CONFEDERATE 'conscription bill' to be null and void. 
Virginia, in the person of Floyd THE  THIEF,  has contested the right 
of 'Jefferson Davis's creatures' (sic) to continue raising men in that 
State. Oldham, who represents Texas in the Richmond Congress,

has formally protested against  the  transport  to the  East,  i.e., 
Virginia,  of the  South-West's 'crack troops'. From  all these DISPUTES 
two things undeniably emerge: 
That  the  CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT  has  overreached itself  in its 
frantic efforts  to fill the  ranks  of the  army; 
that the  STATES  are  asserting 'STATE RIGHTS' vis-à-vis  the Confedera­
cy4'7 just  as the  latter made  a PRETEXT  of them vis-à-vis  the Union. 
I consider  the  victories scored  by the  Democrats  in the  North478 
to be a  reaction  and one  which  was  made  all the  easier  for  that 
conservative  and  BLACKLEG  element  by the  poor manner  in which  the 
Federal Government waged  the war and by its  FINANCIAL BLUNDERS. 
For that matter,  it's the  sort  of reaction that occurs  in every 
revolutionary movement  and  that  was so  strong  at the  time  of the 
National Convention,  for  instance, that  the  proposal  to submit  the 
King's* death  to  suffrage universel  was considered counter­
revolutionary,  and so  strong under  the  Directory that 
Mr Bonaparte  I had to  bombard Paris. 4'9 
On the  other hand, elections prior  to 4  Dec. 1864 will  not  affect 
the composition  of Congress; hence, they will merely  act as a  spur 
to the  Republican government, over whose head  a sword  is 
hanging.  And, in any  case,  the  Republican House  of Representa­
tives will make better  use of its  term  of office,  if only  out of  hatred 
for the  opposing party.480 
As TO McClellan,  in his own  army  he's got  Hooker  and  other 
Republicans,  who  would arrest  him any day if  ordered  to do so by 
the government. 
Add to that  the  French attempt  at intervention481 which will 
evoke  a reaction against  the  reaction. 
So things  are not, I  think,  too bad.  Rather, what might possibly 
do damage  to my  \iews  is the  sheeplike attitude  of the  working 
men in Lancashire. SUCH  A THING HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD  OF IN THE WORLD. 
The more  so since those scoundrels  of manufacturers themselves 
don't even pretend  to be  'making sacrifices',  but are  content  to 
leave  to the  rest of England  the  honour  of keeping their army  on 
its feet—i.e.,  let the  rest of England bear  the  cost of maintaining 
their variable capital. 
Of late, England  has  made more  of an ass of  itself than  ANY  OTHER 
COUNTRY,  the  working  men by  their servile Christian nature,  the 
bourgeois  and  aristocrats  by the  enthusiasm they have shown  for 
slavery IN ITS  MOST DIRECT FORM.  But the two manifestations are 
complementary.

Bismarck's government, by the by, is nothing more nor less than 
the Little German progressists' pious wish come true.482 They used

gave the worst one a bill for £12 at 6 weeks' sight (actually 7, since 
1 dated it from the end of this year), trusting to a CHAPTER OF 
ACCIDENTS. 
On Wednesday" my wife left for Paris. She returned last night. 
Everything would have been AI.I RIGHT if, just before she got there, 
Abarbanel had not been paralysed by a stroke, which left him 
helpless and confined to bed, although mentally unaffected. All in 
all, the series of mishaps that befell her was tragi-comical. First, a 
great storm at sea' her boat got through, another in her 
immediate vicinity (she travelled via Boulogne) went down. 
Abarbanel lives outside Paris. My wife went to see him by rail. 
Something happened to the engine which meant 2 hours delay 
in the journey. Later, an omnibus in which she was 'ravelling 
overturned. And yesterday the wheels of the  CAB  she had taken in 
London became entangled with those of another. She got out and 
arrived here per pedes!' accompanied by 2 boys carrying her 
luggage. One thing, by the by, was achieved in Paris, where she 
sow Massol, etc.' As soon as my work310 comes out, it will be 
published in French. 
But now for the worst piece of ill-luck. Marianne (Lenchen's 
sister' 1), whom Allen treated fo~ a heart complaint a year ago, be­
gan to feel unwell on the day my wife left. By Tuesday evening, 
2 hours before my wife's return, she was dead. During those seven 
days I, together with Lenchen, was responsible for the nursing. 
Allen HAD MISGIVINGS  FROM  THE FIRST  DAY.  The funeral is at 2 o'clock on

So, this must be got hold of. A fine Christmas show for the poor

The events that took place at your house and during your wife's

exceptionally unlucky. But, in any case, it's excellent news that you 
should have some prospect of publication in France. How  is THIS  TO

I fear the good Burnside will get a drubbing on the 
Rappahannock.b He must have a particular proclivity for it, since 
he seems incapable of deciding to risk more than 40,000 men at

fighting there; this may yet happen.

Dear Sir, 
A while ago, Freiligrath showed me a letter he had received

copy and the final polishing before it goes to press.310 There will 
be about 30 sheets of print. It is a sequel to Part I," but will appear 
on its own under the title Capital, with A Contribution to the Critique 
of Political Economy as merely the subtitle. In fact, all it comprises 
is what was to make the third chapter of the first part, namely 
'Capital in General'.35 Hence it includes neither the competition 
between capitals nor the credit system. What Englishmen call  'THE 
PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY' is contained in this volume. It is the 
quintessence (together with the first part), and the development of 
the sequel (with the exception, perhaps, of the relationship 
between the various forms of state and the various economic 
structures of society) could easily be pursued by others on the 
basis thus provided. 
The reasons for the long delay are as follows. In the first place, 
a great deal of my time in 1860 was taken up with the Vogt 
rumpus, since I had a lot of research to do on material which 
was in itself of little interest, besides engaging in lawsuits, etc. In 
1861,  I lost my chief source of income, the New-York Tribune, as a 
result of the American Civil War. My contributions to that paper 
have remained in abeyance up till the present. Thus, I have been, 
and still am, forced to undertake a large amount of hackwork to 
prevent myself and my family from actually being relegated to the 
a K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.

streets. I had even decided to become a 'practical man' and had 
intended to enter a railway OFFICE at the beginning of next year. 
Luckily—or perhaps I should say unluckily?—I did not get 
the post because of my bad handwriting. So, you will see that 
I had little time left and few quiet moments for theoretical work. 
It seems probable that the same circumstances will delay my 
finishing the book for the printers for longer than I should have 
wished. 
As regards publishers, on no account shall I give the second 
volume to Mr Duncker. He was sent the manuscript for Part I in 
December 1858, and it came out in July or August 1859. There is 
some, but not a very promising, prospect of Brockhaus publishing 
the thing. The conspiration de silence with which I am honoured by 
the German literary rabble as soon as the latter finds out that the 
thing can't be dismissed with insults is, quite apart from the 
tendency of my works, unfavourable from the point of view of 
sales.  As soon as I have a fair copy of the manuscript (upon which 
I shall make a start in January 1863), I shall bring it to Germany 
myself,  it being easier to deal with publishers on a personal basis. 
There is every prospect that, as soon as the German edition 
appears, arrangements will be made in Paris for a French version. 
I have absolutely no time to put it into French  myself,  particularly 
since I am going either to write the sequel in German, i.e. to 
conclude the presentation of capital, competition and credit, or 
condense the first two books for English consumption into one 
work. I do not think we can count on its having any effect in 
Germany until it has been given the seal of approval abroad. In 
the first part, the method of presentation was certainly far from 
popular. This was due partly to the abstract nature of the subject, 
the limited space at my disposal, and the aim of the work. The 
present part is easier to understand because it deals with more 
concrete conditions. Scientific attempts to revolutionise a science 
can never be really popular. But, once the scientific foundations 
are laid, popularisation is easy. Again, should times become more 
turbulent, one might be able to select the colours and nuances 
demanded by a popular presentation of these particular subjects. 
On the other hand, I had certainly expected that, if only for the 
sake of appearances, German specialists would not have ignored 
my work so completely. Besides, I had the far from gratifying 
experience of seeing party friends in Germany, who had long 
interested themselves in this branch of knowledge and sent me 
gushing encomia on Part I in private, not lift a finger towards 
getting a critique or even a list of the contents into such journals

as were accessible to them. If these be party tactics, then I must 
confess that they are an impenetrable mystery to me. 
I should be most grateful if you could write to me occasionally 
about the situation at home. We are obviously heading for 
revolution—something I have never once doubted since 1850. 
The first act will include a by no means gratifying rehash of the 
stupidities of '48-'49. However, that's how world history runs its 
course, and one has to take it as one finds it.

Dear Moor, 
On Friday I sent you a registered letter containing 10 pounds, 
£5 in a Bank of England note and £5 in a COUNTRY NOTE of the 
Boston Bank payable at Masterman & Co., BANKERS, London.3 
Having heard nothing from you since, I feel a little uneasy. 
Burnside's defeat is being abominably exaggerated.489 Clearly it 
must affect the army's morale, but by no means so badly as if they 
had been beaten in the open field. The tactical arrangements 
appear to have been very poor. The flank attack by the left wing 
would obviously have had to be developed first before the frontal 
attack went in under Sumner. But this was completely misman­
aged. Sumner was evidently in dire trouble before Franklin even 
had so much as a chance of becoming properly engaged. Again, 
Burnside seems to have been incapable of making up his mind 
about his reserves. The successes on the left wing should have

persuaded him to send at least part of them there, since, after all, 
that was evidently where the affair would have to be decided; 
instead he employed them on his front, and too late even there, 
namely, 1. as reliefs rather than reinforcements for Sumner's 
beaten troops, and 2. so close to nightfall that it was dark before 
half of them were actually engaged. This is, of course, what I have 
gleaned from the indifferent material in the American papers and 
without any knowledge of the terrain. However, it seems to me 
that Burnside would probably have been able to dislodge the 
rabble merely by means of an outflanking movement, especially 
since he appears to have had 150,000 men against 100,000. But he 
was obviously inhibited by the belief that Washington could be 
protected only so long as the army lay squarely between it and the 
enemy. However, the stupidity of allowing the Confederates a 
month in which to consolidate their position and then engaging 
them in a frontal attack admits of no criticism other than a kick in 
the arse.

Dear Frederick, 
Happy New Year! 
I've had so much running about to do this week, not to mention 
SICKNESS, that I never got round to acknowledging receipt of your 
letter containing the money.2 
No reply from Brockhaus so far. b I've heard, by the by, that the 
'head of the house', as Bangya used to say, is absent from Leipzig. 
Through Abarbanel, my wife made the acquaintance in Paris of 
a certain Reclus, who has some sort of a POSITION in economic 
literature, and also knows German. The said R., together with 
Massol (an agent in COMMERCE) who doesn't know German, and a 
number of others, is willing to apply himself to my work. c They 
have a Brussels publisher at their disposal. In Paris, party spirit 
and solidarity still prevail within the parti  socialiste.  Even chaps like 
Carnot and Goudchaux are saying that, come the next upheaval, 
Blanqui ought to be made leader. 
Burnside would seem to have perpetrated grave tactical 
blunders at the battle of Fredericksburg.489 He was clearly shy 
about employing so large a force. But as regards the basic folly, 
1. his having waited 26 days, a contributing factor was undoubted­
ly outright betrayal by the military authorities .in Washington. 
Even the New York CORRESPONDENT of The Times admitted that it was 
weeks before Burnside received equipment that had been prom­
ised at an earlier dated; 2. the fact that he did, nevertheless,

proceed to make this attack is symptomatic of the man's moral 
weakness. The worthy Tribune was beginning to question his 
ability and to threaten him with dismissal. Out of enthusiasm and 
ignorance, that paper is doing a great deal of harm. 
The Democrats and McClellanists naturally howled in unison in 
order to make the setback seem worse than it was. The 'rumour' 
that McClellan, 'the Monk' of The Times, has been called to 
Washington, must be laid at Mr Reuter's door. 
'Politically', the defeat was a good thing. It wouldn't have done 
for the chaps to have had a stroke of luck before 1 January 1863. 
Anything in that line might have led to a cancellation of the 
'Proclamation'.468 
The Times and co. are hellish annoyed by the workers' meetings 
in Manchester, Sheffield, and London.490 It's excellent that the 
scales should thus be removed from the Yankees' eyes. Not that 
Opdyke (MAYOR of New York and  POLITICAL  ECONOMIST)  hadn't already 
declared at a meeting in New York: 
* 'We know that the English working classes are with us, and that the governing 
classes of England are against us.'* 
I greatly regret that Germany should not be staging similar 
demonstrations. They cost nothing and are very remunerative 
'internationally'. Germany would be all the more justified in doing 
so in that she is helping the Yankees more in this war than France 
did in the eighteenth century.491 It's the same old stupid German 
failure to emphasise or to vindicate in the eyes of the world what 
the country really accomplishes.

[London,]  8 January  1863 
Dear Engels, 
The news  of Mary'sa death surprised  no less than  it dismayed 
me. She was so  good-natured, witty  and  closely attached  to you. 
The devil alone knows  why  nothing  but  ill-luqk should  dog 
'everyone  in our  circle just  now. I no  longer know which  way to 
turn either.  My  attempts  to raise money  in France  and  Germany 
have come  to nought,  and it  might,  of course, have been foreseen 
that £15  couldn't help  me to  stem  the  avalanche  for more than  a 
couple  of weeks. Aside from  the  fact that  no one  will let us  have 
anything  on credit—save  for the  butcher  and  baker, which will also 
cease  at the end of  this week—I  am  being dunned  for the  school 
fees, the  rent,  and by the  whole gang  of them. Those  who got a 
few pounds  on  account cunningly pocketed them, only  to fall 
upon  me  with redoubled vigour.  On top of  that,  the  children have 
no clothes  or shoes  in which  to go out. In  short,  all hell is let  loose, 
as I clearly foresaw when  I came  up to  Manchester483  and 
despatched  my  wife  to Parisb  as a  last coup de désespoir?  If I don't 
succeed in raising a largish sum through a  LOAN SOCIETY OR LIFE 
ASSURANCE  (and of  that  I can see no  prospect;  in the  case  of the 
former society  I tried everything  I could think  of, but in  vain. 
They demand guarantors,  and  want  me to  produce receipts  for 
rent and  rates, which  I can't  do),  then  the  household here  has 
barely another  two  weeks  to go. 
It is dreadfully selfish  of me to  tell you  about these horreurs  at 
this time.  But it's a  homeopathic remedy.  One  calamity  is a 
distraction from  the  other.  And, au bout  du compte? what else  can I 
do? In the  whole  of London there's  not a  single person  to whom  I 
can so much  as speak  my  mind,  and in my own  home  I play  the 
silent stoic  to counterbalance  the  outbursts from  the  other side.  It's 
becoming virtually impossible  to work UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. 
Instead  of Mary, ought  it not to  have been  my  mother,  who is in 
any case  a prey  to physical ailments  and has had her  fair share  of

Dear Marx, 
You will find it quite in order that, this time, my own 
misfortune and the frosty view you took of it should have made it 
positively impossible for me to reply to you any sooner. 
All my friends, including philistine acquaintances, have on this 
occasion, which in all conscience must needs afflict me deeply, 
given me proof of greater sympathy and friendship than I could 
have looked for. You thought it a fit moment to assert the 
superiority of your 'dispassionate turn of mind'. Soit!* 
You know the state of my finances. You also know that I do all I 
can to drag you out of the mire. But I cannot raise the largish 
sum of which you speak, as you must also know. Three things can 
be done: 
1. LOAN SOCIETY. To what extent my guarantee would serve here 
remains to be seen—scarcely at all, no doubt, since I am not a 
HOUSEHOLDER. 
a So be it then! 

=====第480页=====
444 269. Marx to Engels. 24 January 1863 
2. Life assurance. John Watts is MANAGER of the European Life 
& Guarantee Society, of which the London OFFICE  is certainly in the 
DIRECTORY. I don't see what there is to prevent you insuring your 
life for £400, and he will certainly make you a loan of £200 on 
the policy, since that is his business. If not completely RUINOUS, this 
is definitely the best way. So, you had best go straight to him, 
inquire about the  TERMS  and then inform me of them straight away. 
3. If the worst comes to the worst, I might be able to raise about 
£25 in February—certainly not before—and am also prepared to 
sign a bill for £60, though I have got to have every assurance that it 
won't have to be paid till after 30 June 1863, i.e. be assured of an 
extension until then. I must be given the necessary guarantees to 
that effect. In which case you would have to extract what was 
lacking from your uncle in Hollanda without fail. 
I can see no other possibility. 
So, let me know what steps you take and I will see to my side of 
it.

Dear Frederick, 
I thought it advisable to allow some time to elapse before 
replying. Your position, on the one hand, and mine, on the other, 
made it difficult to view the situation 'dispassionately'. 
It was very wrong of me to write you that letter,1' and I 
regretted it as soon as it had gone off. However, what happened 
was in no sense due to heartlessness. As my wife and children will 
testify, I was as shattered when your letter' arrived (first thing in

the morning) as if my nearest and dearest had died. But, when I 
wrote to you in the evening, I did so under the pressure of 
circumstances that were desperate in the extreme. The LANDLORD 
had put  a-BROKER  in my house, the butcher had protested a bill, coal 
and provisions were in short supply, and little Jenny was confined 
to bed. GENERALLY, under such CIRCUMSTANCES, my only recourse is 
cynicism. What particularly enraged me was the fact that my wife 
believed I had failed to give you an adequate account of the real 
state of affairs. 
Indeed, your letter was welcome to me in as much as it opened 
her eyes to the 'non possumus? for she knows full well that I didn't 
wait for your advice before writing to my uncle b;- that I couldn't, 
in London, have recourse to Watts whose person and OFFICE are 
both in Manchester; that since Lassalle's latest dunning noticec  I 
have been unable to draw a bill in London and, lastly, that £25 in 
February would not enable us to live in January, still less avert the 
impending crisis. As it was impossible for you to help us, despite 
my having told you we were in the same plight as the Manchester 
workers, she could not but recognise the non possumus, and this is 
what I  wanted,  since an end has got to be put to the present state 
of affairs—the long ordeal by fire, ravaging heart and head alike, 
and, on top of that, the waste of precious time and the keeping up 
of FALSE  APPEARANCES,  this last being as harmful to myself as it is to 
the children. Since then we have been through three weeks such 
as have at last induced my wife to fall in with a suggestion I had 
made long ago and which, for all the unpleasantness it involves, 
not only represents the only way out, but is also preferable to the 
life we have led for the past three years, the last one in particular, 
and which will, besides, restore our SELF-ESTEEM. 
I shall write and tell all our creditors (with the exception of the 
LANDLORD)  that, unless they leave me alone, I shall declare myself 
insolvent by the FAILING  OF A BILL  IN THE  COURT  OF BANKRUPTCY.  This does 
not, of course, apply to the LANDLORD, who has a right to the 
furniture, which he may keep. My two elder childrend will obtain 
employment as  GOVERNESSES  through the Cunningham family. Len-
chen is to enter service elsewhere, and I, along with my wife and 
little Tussy, shall go and live in the same CITY  MODEL  LODGING  HOUSE 
in which Red  Wolff 8 once resided with his family. 
Before coming to this decision, I naturally first wrote to sundry 
acquaintances in Germany, naturally without result. At all events,

this will be better than going on as we are, which is impracticable, 
in any case. It was as much as I could do, and involved all manner 
of humiliations, to obtain by dint of false promises the peaceable 
withdrawal of the LANDLORD and butcher, together with the BROKER 
and a bill of exchange. I haven't been able to send the children to 
school for the new term, since the old bill hasn't been paid; nor, 
for that matter, were they in a presentable state. 
But by adopting the above plan I shall, I think, at least attain 
tranquillity without intervention of any kind by third parties. 
Finally, a matter unconnected with the above. I'm in considera­
ble doubt about the section in my book that deals with 
machinery.494 I have never quite been able to see in what way 
SELF-ACTORS changed spinning, or rather, since steam power was 
already in use before then, how it was that the spinner, despite 
steam power, had to intervene with his motive power. 
I'd be grateful if you could explain this. 
Apropos. Unbeknown to me, my wife wrote and asked Lupus 
for £1 for IMMEDIATE NECESSITIES. He sent her two. It's distasteful to 
me, but factum est factum."

burying the last vestige of my youth. When your letter arrived she 
had not yet been buried. That letter, I tell you, obsessed me for a 
whole week; I couldn't get it out of my head. NEVERMIND. Your last 
letter made up for it and I'm glad that, in losing Mary, I didn't 
also lose my oldest and best friend. 
To turn to your affairs. Today I went straight to Watts, whom I 
had believed to be still in London; he does have an OFFICE in 
London, by the way, at No. 2 Pall Mall. It's no go with him. His 
company has stopped making loans. He gave me another address. 
The man is willing but, depending on the circumstances, requires 
two or even more  SURETIES  for the interest, premium and repayment. 
Unfortunately, we can't comply with that. Whom .could we find? 
Gumpert, at most, but it's doubtful whether he would be 
acceptable. In addition, a third person would in any case be 
required, since neither of us has citizen status and, finally, the 
EXPENSES are deductible from the  LOAN  in advance, so that little would 
be left. 
It then occurred to me to sell part of trie yarn bought on spec 
and, instead of repaying the amount to Ermen (to whom the 
money belongs), send it to you. This might possibly have worked, 
since the matter wouldn't have come up for discussion until July 
and much can change in the meantime. But  NO  CHANCE.  Today the 
market is so flat that I would have had to sell at a loss rather than 
a profit and might not even have managed to make a sale at all 
this week. 
I can't borrow any money. E. might, and probably would, refuse 
me, and I can't lay myself open to that. To borrow from a third 
party up here, a usurer, would mean giving E. the best of reasons 
for releasing himself from his contract with me. And yet, I can't 
stand by and see you carrying out the plan you told me about in 
your letter." I therefore had a go at old Hill's bills, helped myself 
to the enclosed for £100 on John Rapp & Co., due 28 February, 
and endorsed it in your favour. I don't imagine it will come to 
light before July, and then we'll have a further reprieve. It is an 
exceedingly daring move on my part, for I'm now certain to incur 
a deficit, but the risk must be taken. I assure you I should never 
have dared do it had not Charles,h  who had drawn up a sort of 
balance sheet covering all items over the last six months, told me 
this afternoon that in my case the thing works out at approx. £30 
à £50 more than I might have expected. I have made about £330 
à £350 during the six months.

But equally you yourself must now realise that, as a result of the 
unusual exertions I have had to make since 30 June 1862, I have 
really been drained dry and you shouldn't therefore count on any 
remittances at all from me until 30 June, save perhaps for trifling 
amounts. What the prospects will be after 30 June God only 
knows, for we're earning nothing at the moment, since the market

MARX TO ENGELS 369 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 28 January 1863 
Dear Frederick, 
A strange concatenation of events made it quite impossible for 
me to write to you yesterday to acknowledge receipt of your letter 
enclosing the bill. 
I am well aware what a risk you were running in thus affording 
us such great and unexpected help. I can't tell you how grateful I 
am, although /  myself,  in my inner forum, did not require any 
fresh proof of your friendship to convince me of its self-sacrificing 
nature. If, by the by, you could have seen my children's joy, it 
would have been a fine reward for you. 
I can tell you now, too, without beating about the bush that, 
despite the straits I've been in during the past few weeks, nothing 
oppressed me so much as the fear that our friendship might be 
severed. Over and over again, I told my wife that the mess we 
were in was as nothing to me compared with the fact that these

bourgeois pinpricks and her peculiar exasperation had, at such a 
moment, rendered me capable of assailing you with my private 
needs instead of trying to comfort you. Domestic peace was 
CONSEQUENTLY much disrupted, and the poor woman had to suffer 
for something of which she was in fact innocent, for women are 
wont to ask for the impossible. She did not, of course, have any 
inkling of what I had written, but a little reflection should have 
told her that something of the kind must be the result. Women 
are funny creatures, even those endowed with much intelligence. 
In the morning my wife wept over Marie3 and your loss, thus 
becoming quite oblivious to her own misfortunes, which culmi­
nated that very day, and in the evening she felt that, except for us, 
no one in the world was capable of suffering unless they had 
children and the  BROKER  in the house. 
In my last letter I asked you about the SELF -ACTOR.1' The question, 
you see, is as follows: In what way, before its invention, did the 
so-called spinner intervene? I can explain the SELF-ACTOR, but not 
the state of affairs that preceded it. 
I am inserting certain things into the section on machinery.494 
There are some curious questions which I originally failed to deal 
with. To elucidate these, I have re-read all my note-books 
(excerpts) on technology493 and am also attending a practical 
(purely experimental) course for working men given by  Prof. 
Willis (in Jermyn Street, the Institute of Geology, where Huxley 
also lectured). For me, mechanics presents much the same 
problem as languages. I understand the mathematical laws, but the 
simplest technical reality that calls for ocular knowledge is more 
difficult for me than the most complicated combinations. 
You may or may not know, for of itself the thing's quite 
immaterial, that there is considerable controversy as to what 
distinguishes a machine from a tool. After its own crude fashion, 
English (mathematical) mechanics calls a TOOL  A SIMPLE MACHINE and a 
MACHINE  A COMPLICATED TOOL. English technologists, however, who take 
rather more account of economics, distinguish the two (and so, 
accordingly, do many, if not most, English economists) in as much 
as in one case the MOTIVE POWER emanates from man, in the other 
from A NATURAL FORCE. From this, the German jackasses, who are 
great on little matters like this, have concluded that a plough, for 
instance, is a machine, and the most complicated JENNY,4 etc., in so 
far as it is moved by hand, is not. However, if we take a look at 
the machine in its elementary form, there can be no doubt that the

industrial revolution originates, not from motive power, but from 
that part of machinery called the  WORKING  MACHINE  by the English, 
i.e. not from, say, the use of water or steam in place of the foot to 
move the spinning wheel, but from the transformation of the 
actual spinning process  itself,  and the elimination of that part of 
human labour that was not mere EXERTION  OF POWER (as in treadling a 
wheel),  but was concerned with processing, working directly on the 
material to be processed. Nor, on the other hand, can there be any 
doubt that, once we turn our attention from the historical 
development of machinery to machinery on the basis of the 
present mode of production, the only decisive factor is the working 
machine (e.g. in the case of the sewing-machine). For, as everyone 
knows today, once this process is mechanised, the thing may be 
moved, according to size, either by hand, water or a steam-engine. 
To those who are merely mathematicians, these questions are of 
no moment, but they assume great importance when it comes to 
establishing a connection between human social relations and the 
development of these material modes of production. 
Re-reading my technological and historical excerpts has led me 
to the conclusion that, aside from the invention of gunpowder, the 
compass and printing—those necessary prerequisites of bourgeois 
progress—the two material bases upon which the preparatory 
work for mechanised industry in the sphere of manufacturing was 
done between the sixteenth and the mid-eighteenth century, i.e. 
the period during which manufacturing evolved from a handicraft 
to big industry proper, were the clock and the mill (initially the 
flour mill and, more specifically, the water mill), both inherited 
from Antiquity. (The water mill was brought to Rome from Asia 
Minor in Julius Caesar's time.) The clock was the first automatic 
device to be used for practical purposes, and from it the whole 
theory of the production of regular motion evolved. By its very 
nature, it is based on a combination of the artist-craftsman's work 
and direct theory. Cardan, for instance, wrote about clock-making 
(and provided practical instructions). German sixteenth-century 
writers describe clock-making as a 'scientific (non-guild) handi­
craft', and, from the development of the clock, it could be shown 
how very different is the handicraft-based relation between 
book-learning and practice from that, e.g., in big industry. Nor can 
there be any doubt that it was the clock which, in the eighteenth 
century, first suggested the application of automatic devices (in 
fact, actuated by springs) in production. It is historically demonstr­
able that Vaucanson's experiments in this field stimulated the 
imagination of English inventors to a remarkable extent. 

=====第487页=====
271. Marx to Engels. 28 January 1863 451 
In the case of the mill, on the other hand, the essential 
distinctions in the organism of a machine were present from the 
outset, i.e. as soon as the water mill made its appearance. 
Mechanical motive power. Primo, 3 the motor for which it had 
been waiting. The transmission mechanism. Lastly, the working 
machine, which handles the material, each existing independently 
of the others. It was upon the mill that the theory of friction was 
based, and hence the study of the mathematical forms of 
gear-wheels, cogs, etc.; likewise, the first theory of measurement of 
the degree of motive power, the best way of applying it, etc. Since 
the middle of the seventeenth century almost all great mathemati­
cians,  in so far as they have concerned themselves with the theory 
and practice of mechanics, have taken the simple, water-driven 
flour mill as their point of departure. Indeed, this was why the 
words Mühle and MILL, which came to be used during the 
manufacturing period, were applied to all driving mechanisms 
adapted for practical purposes. 
But in the case of the mill, as in that of the press, the forge, the 
plough, etc., the actual work of hammering, crushing, milling, 
tilling, etc., is done from the outset without human labour, even 
though the MOVING FORCE be human or animal. Hence this type of 
machinery is very old, at least in its origins, and, in its case, 
mechanical propulsion proper was applied at an earlier date. 
Hence it is virtually the only kind of machinery that occurs during 
the manufacturing period as well. The industrial revolution began 
as soon as mechanical means were employed in fields where, from 
time immemorial, the final result had called for human labour and 
not therefore—as in the case of the above-mentioned tools— 
where the actual material to be processed had never, within living 
memory, been directly connected with the human hand; where, by 
the nature of things and from the outset, man has not functioned 
purely as POWER.  If, like the German jackasses, one insists that the 
application of animal  POWERS  (which is just as much voluntary motion 
as the application of human powers) constitutes machinery, then 
the application of this form of locomotor is far older than the 
simplest of manual tools in any case.

defence (has been sentenced to four months) before the court.49 '

As you know, the thing's no more nor less than a badly done 
vulgarisation of the Manifesto* and of other things we have 
advocated so often that they have already become commonplace to 
a certain extent. (For instance, the fellow calls the working class an 
'estate'.) 
WELL.  In his speech before the Berlin court, he had the 
effrontery to say: 
'I further maintain that this pamphlet is not just a scientific work like so many 
others, a mere compendium of ready-made answers, but that it is, in very many 
respects, a scientific achievement, an exposé of new scientific ideas.... I have ushered 
into the world comprehensive works in varied and difficult fields of scholarship, 
sparing myself neither pains nor nocturnal vigils in my endeavour to enlarge the 
frontiers of scholarship as such, and I may, perhaps, say with Horace: militavi non 
sine gloria!' But this / myself tell you: Never, not even in my most comprehensive 
works, have I penned a single line that was reasoned with more rigorous 
scholarship than was this production from its first page to its last.... Cast an eye, 
therefore, on the contents of this pamphlet. The contents are nothing less than a 
philosophy of history, compressed into 44 pages.... It is an exposé of the objective, 
reasoning thought process, which has underlain European history for more than a 
millennium now, a discovery of the innermost soul, etc.' 
Is not this the most egregious effrontery? The fellow evidently 
thinks himself destined to take over our stock-in-trade. And 
withal, how absurdly grotesque!

Dear Frederick, 
I enclose divers Urquhartiana. Of late, the fellows have really 
distinguished themselves by their stupidity. Take, for example, 
their 'philosophy' with regard to the movement in the UNITED 
STATES.3 • 
I'd have written before now, but for some twelve days I've been 
STRICTLY forbidden all reading, writing, or smoking. I had some 
kind of inflammation of the eye, combined with a most obnoxious 
affection of the nerves of the head. Things have improved to such 
an extent that I am venturing to write again for the first time at 
this moment. In between whiles I indulged in all manner of 
psychological fantasies about what it would feel like to be blind or 
insane. 
What do you think of the Polish business?499 This much is 
certain, the ERA OF REVOLUTION has now FAIRLY OPENED IN EUROPE once 
more. And the general state of affairs is good. But the 
comfortable  DELUSIONS  and almost childish enthusiasm with which we 
welcomed the revolutionary era before February 1848, have gone 
by the board. Old comrades such as Weerth, etc., are no more, 
others have fallen by the wayside or gone to the bad and, if there 
is new stock, it is, at least, not yet in' evidence. Moreover, we now 
know what role stupidity plays in revolutions, and how they are 
exploited by blackguards. Incidentally, the 'Prussian' enthusiasts 
for the 'Italian' and 'Hungarian' nationalities500 are already finding 
themselves in a fix. The 'Prussians' are not going to deny their 
Russian sympathies. This time, let us hope, the lava will flow from 
East to West and not in the opposite direction, so that we shall be 
spared the 'honour' of the French initiative. Apart from that, the 
adventure in Mexico is providing a truly classical epilogue to the 
farce of the LOWER EMPIRE.501 
The 'Herzenian' soldiers502 appear to be setting about things in 
the traditional manner. However, there's little to be deduced 
a This presumably refers to the first instalment of the anonymous article 'Origin 
and Objects of the Treason in the United States', The Free Press, Vol. IX, No. 2, 
4 February 1863.

therefrom, either in respect of the masses in Russia, or  EVEN  the 
bulk of the Russian Army. We know what was done by the 
'intelligent bayonets'503  of the French, not to mention our own 
Rhineland ruffians in Berlin in 1848. But at present you should 
WATCH  The Bell, for Herzen et cie. now have the chance to 
demonstrate their revolutionary integrity—in so far as it is 
compatible with Slav  PREDILECTIONS. 
The Urquhartites will probably say that the Polish insurrection 
was stirred up by the St. Petersburg cabinet as a'diversion' from 
Urquhart's  INTENDED  INVASION  OF THE  CAUCASUS.504 
In the  UNITED STATES  things are going damned slowly. I hope that 
J. Hooker will extricate  himself. 
Well, make sure you first let me know what you're doing with 
yourself in Manchester now. It must be a damned lonely place for 
you. I know from my own experience how the region round Soho 
Square still sends a shiver down my spine if I happen to be 
anywhere near there.506

The Polish business and Prussia's intervention507 do indeed 
represent a combination that impels us to speak. Not in person, 
partly so as to avoid any appearance of competing with the

Dear Moor, 
You must excuse my long silence. I was in a vety forlorn state, 
and it was high time I extricated myself from it. I tried Slavonic 
languages but the loneliness was unbearable. I had to force myself 
to seek distraction. That helped, and I am now my old self again. 
The Poles are really splendid fellows. If they manage to hold 
out until 15 March, there'll be a general conflagration in Russia. 
At first, I was devilish afraid the business might go wrong. But 
now there would seem to be almost more chance of victory than of 
defeat. Nor should it be forgotten that the younger members of the 
Polish emigration have a military literature of their own in which 
ail matters are discussed with special reference to Polisii condi-

tions,  or that, in that literature, the idea of guerrilla warfare in 
Poland plays a leading role and is discussed in great detail. 509 
Oddly enough, the only two leaders to have been named so far are 
Frankowski, a Warsaw Jew, and Langiewicz, a Prussian lieutenant. 
The Russian messieurs, in view of their ineptitude, are bound to 
suffer appallingly as a result of guerrilla warfare. 
Have you seen that Bakunin and Mierostawski are dubbing one 
another liars, and are at loggerheads over the Russo-Polish 
frontiers? I have ordered3 the Kolokol, from which I shall 
presumably find out more about it.3'0 Incidentally, I shall have to 
do some hard swotting before I can work my way through it 
again. 
The Prussians are behaving infamously as always.507 Monsieur 
Bismarck knows that it will be a matter of life and death for him if 
there's revolution in Poland and Russia. Not that there's any hurry 
over Prussian intervention. So king as it's not necessary, the 
Russians won't permit it, and when it does become necessary, the 
Prussians will take care not to go. 
If things go wrong in Poland, then we shall probably face a year 
or two of acute reaction, for in that case the ripaBOCAaBHwo 
H,apbb would again become head of a Holy Alliance,511  which last 
would again cause Monsieur Bonaparte to be looked on as a great 
liberal and champion of nations by the stupid crapauds? Apropos, 
how funny it is to see the entire English bourgeoisie pitching into 
Boustrapa, 167 now that Kinglake has made public a small, 
improperly digested and improperly heard fragment of the same 
tittle-tattle about him and his LOTd as we've been telling them for 
ten years without their believing us. Revelations about the court in 
Paris are again becoming quite the rage and, in the Guardian, 
Mr Tom Taylor6 is portentously dishing up all that stuff  re la Solms, 
Bonaparte, Wyse, the Jecker affair, etc., that we've long known far 
more about. There's only one thing of interest, namely that Jecker 
had already supplied money for the Strasbourg or the Boulogne 
conspiracy—which, Taylor doesn't know. This, then, accounts for 
the connection.

DEAR FREDERICK, 
I think our best course re the Polish business would be as 
follows: 
The proclamation for the workingmen, i.e. in the name of the 
Society,508 should amount to one sheet of print at most, military 
and political  TOGETHER.  SO, write that first. I shall then fit mine in. 
The Society will print this. 
However, it would also be a good idea for us to deal with the 
subject in greater detail in a pamphlet,512 and there you must 
determine the number of sheets entirely in accordance with the 
material. The diplomatic bit, which I am  READY  to do at any time, 
would in fact only be an appendix. As  TO a publisher, I intend to

I shall send you the stuff for the manifesto"—quite  brief—,  but

your province—you will have to deal with this. 
Ad vocemb  pamphlet: I thought of dividing the thing up as 
follows: 1. Russia's military position vis-à-vis the West and South 
before, 2. ditto after, the 3 partitions of Poland, 3. ditto after 
1814, 51S 4. the attitude of Russia and Germany after the restora­
tion of Poland. (Something will have to be said here about 
Prussian Poland, linguistic boundaries, and the statistical propor­
tions of the mixed population.) All in all, at most 3-4 sheets; title: 
Germany and Poland. Political-Military Considerations on the 
Occasion of the Polish Uprising of  1863. 512 It would then be up to 
you to go over your notes in the meantime and prepare them to 
the extent of being able, immediately on receipt of the ms., either 
to fit them in at the appropriate places or include them as an 
appendix and refer to them as necessary. If you have any further 
observations to make about this, write and tell me as soon as 
possible so that I can bear them in mind.

Dear Engels, 
At the HEIGHT of my own crisis I wrote to Dronke.42 ABOUT  A MONTH 
AFTER that, I had a letter from him to say that he had been away. 
Yesterday, he turned up here unexpectedly and left today after a 
further meeting. 
He told me (the initiative was his) that he wanted to help raise a 
substantial sum, so that I could work in peace for a year. He then 
mentioned you. I told him (I didn't think it necessary to go into 
detail on this occasion) that you had done a great deal and would 
not have a penny to spare for many months TO COME." His 
rejoinder: 'It's not a question of months but of one to two years.' 
He is to discuss the matter with you personally. 
To what extent all this should be taken seriously or is simply 
bragging, you will best be able to judge for  yourself. 
Apropos. My 'liver' is very swollen, add to which I have twinges 
of pain when I cough and feel some discomfort when pressure is 
applied. Will you inquire from Gumpert about a household remedy. 
If I go to Allen, the upshot will be a complete course of treatment 
and for that, quite apart from numerous other considerations, I 
have no time just now. 
My chief anxiety about the Polish affair499 is that beastly 
Bonaparte will find a pretext for moving up to the Rhine and 
extricate himself from a nasty situation again. 
Send me (since you have more material to hand on the subject) 
a few notes (detailed) on the conduct of Frederick William the 
Justfa in the year 1813 after Napoleon's failure in Russia. This time 
we must go for the dismal House of Hohenzollern. 
I left Dronke in doubt as to whether the second volume was 
already being printed or not.310

almost entirely prevented me from reading or writing. Hence the 
need to make up for lost time by some hard slogging. HincA my 
silence. 
Dronke has sent me £50. 
The enclosed letter from Dr Kugelmann, which kindly return, 
will show you what muddle-headed fellows these German 'party 
members' are. My work on economics 310 'isn't opportune' and yet I 
am expected, for the sake of the cause, to carry on with the whole 
business after this volume has appeared, merely for the theoretical 
satisfaction of a few high-minded souls. What I am expected to 
live on while engaged in my 'inopportune works' is not, of course, 
a question these gentry worry their heads about for one 
moment.51'1 
The Langiewicz affair is disgusting.>lb But I am hoping that it 
won't put paid to the business yet, even temporarily. Meanwhile, I 
am deferring the work on Poland'12 so as to be able to see EVENTS 
when they have reached a rather more advanced stage. 
Politically, the view I have reached is this: that Vincke and 
Bismarck do, in fact, accurately represent the principle of the 
Prussian State; that the 'State' of Prussia (a very different creature 
from Germany) cannot exist either without Russia as she is, or with 
H ente

an independent Poland. The whole history of Prussia leads one to 
this conclusion which was drawn long since by Messrs Hohenzol-
lern (Frederick II included). This princely consciousness is 
infinitely superior to the limited mentality of the subject that 
marks your Prussian liberal. Since, therefore, the existence of 
Poland is necessary to Germany and completely incompatible with 
the State of Prussia, the State of Prussia must be erased from the 
map.  Or the Polish question simply provides further occasion for 
proving that it is impossible to prosecute German interests so long 
as the Hohenzollerns' own state continues to exist. Down with 
Russian hegemony over Germany means just the same as away 
with mischief,  with the old sodomite's brood. 3 
What strikes me as very significant about the latest turn of 
events in America is the fact that they are again proposing to hand 
out letters of marque.517  Quoad b England, this will put an entirely 
different complexion on the matter and may, UNDER FAVOURABLE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, lead to war with England, so that self-satisfied John 
Bull will find not only his COTTON but also his CORN WITHDRAWN from 
under his nose. At the beginning of the  CIVIL  WAR Seward had, off 
his own bat, had the presumption to accept the resolutions of the 
1856 Congress of Paris as provisionally valid for America, too. 
(This came to light with the publication of the despatches 
concerning the Trent affair.)518 In Washington, Congress and 
Lincoln, enraged at the OUTFITTING OF SOUTHERN PIRATES in Liverpool, 
etc., have now put an end to the lark. This has greatly alarmed the 
Stock Exchange here, though the faithful hounds of the press are 
obeying orders, of course, and not mentioning the affair in the 
papers. 
You will doubtless have noted with satisfaction how Pam, the old 
scoundrel, is playing precisely the same game as in  1830/31 519 (I 
have compared his speeches) and likewise getting The Times to 
play it.c This time the progress of the affair is so FAR  GOOD.  Louis 
Bonaparte is about to find himself in the soup (when this 
happened to the luckless Louis Philippe in 1831 the whole of 
Europe suffered) and IN A VERY UGLY DILEMMA WITH HIS OWN ARMY. 
Mexico4 " and those genuflections before the Tsar in the Moniteur 
(into which Boustrapa 167 was pushed by Pam) might well cost him 
his neck. So great was his alarm that he ordered the publication of 
the despatches demonstrating that his good will had been thwarted

legende. - b Concerning - c This refers to a leading article in The Times, No. 24514,

by Pam  alone. (Although  his  CASE  was  identical,  the  luckless 
Louis Philippe went  so far as to  allow  the  impudent  Pam to  claim 
in Parliament that  *'if it  were  not for the  perfidy  of the  French  and 
the intervention  of Prussia, Poland would still exist'*.)  He  believes 
that he  will thereby influence  PUBLIC OPINION  in England,  as though 
the latter were  not  satisfied with Pam's  SOP  to the  effect that 
Bonaparte wanted  to reach  the  Rhine!  And as  though  Pam did not 
manufacture three-quarters of this  PUBLIC OPINION  himself!  The 
wretched Plon-Plon hadn't  the  courage  to say  that  Pam was 
working  for  Russia; rather,  he  maintains that wicked Russia  is 
seeking  to foment discord between France  and  England! "20  Here 
once again  I recognise  the  * very image  of my  homme  du Bas 
Empire,* 501 the  wretched fellow  who  never dares stage  his  coups 
d'état  au delà des frontières h without  the  permission  of Europe's Supreme 
Authority.  Had the  wretched fellow  the  courage  to  tell  the 
unvarnished truth about  Pam (or  simply threaten  to do so), he 
could saunter  up to the  Rhine undisturbed.  But now he has  bound 
himself hand  and  foot, thus delivering himself completely into 
Pam's power,  as did  Louis Philippe before  him.  Much good  may it 
do him. 
The goings-on  in Staleybridge  and  Ashton  are  very cheering.5'21 
So the  double chins  and  pot-bellies have  at last ceased  to 'respect' 
the prolétaires. Edmund Potter c makes  a great fool  of himself today 
in The  Timesd which, faced with  the  unpopularity  it now  enjoys  in 
such large measure,  POUNCES UPON THAT  ASS  in order to  CATCH  a 
ha'pennyworth  of popularity."

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 8 April 1863 
Dear Moor, 
I have been meaning to write to you for the past six days and 
have been continually prevented from doing so. Especially by the 
worthy  Eichboff.  The poor devil allowed himself to be so 
thoroughly cheated in Liverpool by Prussian lieutenants on the 
run and commercial swindlers that he has become responsible for 
about £100's worth of debts OVER AND ABOVE the capital that was 
thrown down the drain, not by him, but by his partner. He'd come 
here,  he said, to stay for some time and would accept any post that 
was offered him; he was making a great mystery of what he was 
doing here, etc. However, it soon became apparent that, instead of 
looking round for posts, he was engaging in all kinds of 
mysterious agency transactions and it's now plain to me that he is 
conducting a BLOCKADE-RUNNING BUSINESS TO THE CONFEDERATE STATES on 
behalf of little Dronke, who is very deeply involved in this line. 
H ence all the secrecy, though the  GREENNESS  of our friend is such (it 
is really beyond all bounds) that the secret keeps leaking out all 
the time. Enfin* the chap has little to do just now, and I'm often 
saddled with him in the afternoons. Since he refuses to be 
straightforward with me, I can't, of course, do anything much to 
help him, save in cases where he actually asks my advice. 
I fear the Polish business is going wrong.499 Langiewicz's 
defeat',lb would already seem to have made its mark in the 
Kingdom.1' The Lithuanian movement is by far the most 
important because 1. it extends beyond the borders of Congress 
Poland022  and 2. because the peasants here play a greater part and 
the thing, if one looks towards Kurland, becomes unmistakably 
agrarian but unless this movement makes good progress and 
revives that in the Kingdom, I don't imagine the prospects are 
very considerable. Langiewicz's conduct seems to me as very 
dubious. Which party first broke the contract of alliance—which 
was absolutely essential to the success of the uprising—it will be 
difficult to establish. But it would be interesting to know how

much truth there is in the rumours that link Mieroslawski, on the 
one hand, and Koscielski, on the other, with Plon-Plon." If I'm not 
mistaken, Branicki has long since been a Plonplonist. 
The worthy Kugelmann certainly seems to have the most 
wonderfully magnanimous plans for you. That men of genius 
must also eat, drink and be housed and even pay for these things, 
is much too prosaic a notion for these honest Germans, and to 
suspect them of so much as harbouring it would be virtually 
tantamount to an insult. I should like to find out who the know-all 
was who confided to him that I have disowned my book.' 23 You 
will doubtless enlighten the good man on this score. As to the new 
edition (which, according to the same premises, would certainly be 
ANYTHING BUT opportune), this is not a suitable moment in any case,-
now that the English proletariat's revolutionary energy has all but 
completely evaporated and the English proletarian has declared 
himself in full agreement with the dominancy of the bourgeoisie. 
I have read the new things by Lyell and Huxley, 1' both very 
interesting and pretty good. Lyell has some rhetoric but also some 
fine witty remarks, e.g. where, having vainly quoted all the 
naturalists in an attempt to establish the qualitative difference 
between men and apes, he finally quotes the Archbishop of 
Canterbury' as asserting that man differs from beasts by virtue of 
religion. Apropos, just now the old faith here is being well and 
truly sniped at, and from all sides. It will soon be found necessary 
to concoct a platitudinous system of rationalism for the protection 
of religion. Owen got someone to reply to Huxley in The Edinburgh 
Review, the answer conceded all the essential facts of the case and 
took issue only with the phraseology.' 1 
Little Dronke evidently thought there was something tremen­
dously heroic in his intention to raise £250 with his banker on my 
acceptance and actually pay the expenses and interest, amounting 
to less than £15,  himself.  My refusal, when confronted with such 
heroism, to undertake to provide the £250 within a year—you're 
the best judge of why I couldn't do soe —struck him as mesquin 1 in 
the extreme. I assure you that, but for you, I would have kicked

London, 9 April 1863 
Dear Frederick, 
Little Tussy was delighted with the letter and its contents and 
cannot be dissuaded from replying in 'person'. 
I have known all about Mieroslawski's Plonplonism524  for years 
now through J. Ph. Becker and Schily. Anyway, I had deduced it 
even earlier from a book he published during the last Russo-
Turkish war. 3 One of the things the magnanimous fellow 
proposed therein was the partition of Germany into 2 countries. 
But I've never heard anything of the kind in connection with 
Koscielski. As for M.'s ludicrous vanity and boundless credulity the 
minute his vanity is tickled, Becker sent me a highly comical 
account of it from Italy in 1860. 
Izzy has already brought out 2 more pamphlets about his trialb;

luckily he has not sent them to me. On the other hand, the day 
before yesterday I received his open reply to the central working 
men's committee for the Leipzig working men's (read louts') 
congress.325 He gives himself all the airs of a future working men's 
dictator—self-importantly dispensing the phrases he has borrowed 
from us. He solves the wages v. capital problem 'with delightful 
ease'  (verbotenusd). The workers, that is, are to agitate for general 
suffrage, after which they are to send people like himself into the 
Chamber of Deputies, armed 'with the naked sword of science'. 
Next they organise workers' factories, for which the state advances 
the capital and,  BY AND  BY, these institutions spread throughout the 
country. This, at any rate, is surprisingly new! Let me quote a 
sentence for you: 
'If, today, a German labour movement is already discussing the question as to 
whether the association should  be conceived in the light of his' (Schulze-Delitzsch's) 'ideas or 
of mine, the merit is largely his; and that is where his true merit lies—a merit which 
cannot be esteemed too highly.... The cordiality with which I acknowledge that merit 
should not prevent us, etc'

At the very time when Palmerston was in Glasgow, another 
great man announced his coming, the student Karl  Blind.  Prior to 
his arrival, he sent an item to the Glasgow North British Mail 
under the heading 'M. Karl Blind', beneath which the paper had 
inserted the ominous word 'COMMUNICATED'. 
This remarkable communique—written  by  himself,  like all the items 
about him circulating in the press, and inserted in the paper by that 
jackass McAdam—opens with the following unique introduction: 
*'At the present moment when a patriot exile is about to visit Glasgow, for the 
purpose of bringing under public notice the merits of the Polish question, it is fitting 
that a few remarks should be made upon his political career, and more especially so 
from the unfortunate fact that he is comparatively unknown in Scotland. German by 
birth and German by exile, Mr Karl Blind's efforts have not  come so  prominently and so 
persistently before Europe as to have gained for him universal admiration from the 
liberating party, or universal execration from the oppressing party. He has hitherto 
stood in that middle way, where he has the honour of being  both beloved  and hated;  but in 
these two contending ranks which have rendered to him their tribute after its kind the 
whole of Europe is not ranged, Mr Karl Blind having  the satisfaction of knowing there is 
a third section of his friends who are simply indifferent. He therefore comes before the

Scottish public with perhaps less prejudice against  him  than  has  been  the case with 
most  of the  distinguished exiles  who  preceded  him'.*a 
There follows  a short biographical note  on the  GREAT  UNKNOWN  in 
which Scotland and  THE  THIRD SECTION'  OF MANKIND  are informed that 
the said 'MR  KARL BLIND'  IS A  NATIVE  OF BADEN,  AND  WAS ORIGINALLY,  LIKE 
KOSSUTH  AND  MAZZIN1, TRAINED  TO  THE LAW.  That  the  'BADISH  REVOLUTION'  WaS 
THE RESULT  OF  HIS  PROPAGANDISE, that  the  'GOVERNMENTS  OF  BADEN  AND  THE 
PALATINATE'  had sent him to Paris in June  'IN  THE CAPACITY OF DIPLOMATIC:

DISTINGUISHES  THE  MORE CELEBRATED EXILES:' 
Isn't that 'naice'b? 
My wife  has now  been confined  to bed for a  fortnight  and has 
gone almost completely  deaf,  heaven knows why. Little Jenny  has 
had another attack  of diphtheria  of some sort.  If you  could send 
me some wine  for  both  of them (Allen wants little Jenny  to have 
port),  I'd be  most grateful. 
Here  in London  a parson  (as  distinct from  the  atheists  who 
preach  in John Street)  has  been giving deistic sermons  for the 
public,  in which  he  makes Voltairian  fun of the  Bible.  (My  wife 
and children went  to hear  him  twice  and  thought highly  of him as 
a humorist). 
I attended a  TRADE UNIONS  meeting chaired by Bright. y2b He had 
very much  the air of an  INDEPENDENT  D'1 and,  whenever  he said  'IN THE 
UNITED STATES  NO  KINGS,  NO  BISHOPS',  there  was a  BURST  OF APPLAUSE.  The 
working  men  themselves spoke very well indeed, without  a trace  of 
bourgeois rhetoric  or the  faintest attempt  to conceal their opposition 
to the  capitalists (who,  by the  by, were also attacked  by papa Bright). 
How soon  the  English workers will throw  off  what seems  to be a 
bourgeois contagion remains  to be  seen.  So far as the  main theses 
in your book'  are  concerned,  by the by,  they have been 
corroborated down  to the  very last detail  by  developments 
subsequent  to 1844. For I  have again been comparing  the  book 
with the  notes  I made  on the  ensuing period. Only your 
small-minded German philistine  who  measures world history  by 
the ell and by  what  he  happens  to think  are  'interesting news 
items',  could regard  20  years  as more than  a day  where major 
developments  of this kind  are  concerned, though these  may be 
again succeeded  by  days into which  20  vears  are  compressed.

Dear Moor, 
It is hard to say what is to be done about Lassalle; après tout, 3 I'd 
have assumed it to be beneath the great Izzy's dignity to reply to 
such petty Meyenian tittle-tattle 6 with the heavy artillery of a 
formal démenti. Let the chap clear up his own messes; if he's any 
good, he needs no testimonials from you, and why should you 
compromise  yourself,  now that you've told him that he can't go 
hand in hand with us, or we hand in hand with him? c Anyhow, 
what arrant stupidity to involve himself in the affairs of the 
Schulze-Delitzsch louts329 and try to form a party for himself out 
of that, of all things, on the basis of our earlier works. The very 
endeavour of S.-D. and other such rabble in these bourgeois times 
to raise the outlook of the louts to the bourgeois level must needs 
be welcome to us, for otherwise we'd have to deal with this 
business during the revolution, and in Germany, where the small 
state system so greatly complicates matters, we might be con­
fronted with this piddling stuff as something new and practical. 
That is now disposed of and we now have our opponents where 
we want them; the lout has achieved self-consciousness and thus 
finds himself in the ranks of the petty-bourgeois democrats. But to 
regard these fellows as representatives of the proletariat—it took 
Izzy to do that. 
Lupus and I were greatly amused by the funny tale about 
student Blind.d Lupus has had another severe attack of gout, 
aggravated by the obstinate way he insists on going out and giving 
lessons when not yet fully recovered, and only sending for the 
doctor when it's far too late and he's used up all his medicine. But 
it's no use remonstrating; 'I'm going!' 
Latterly I've been reading Russian history in reverse, i.e., first 
Catherine and the partition of Poland,313 then Peter I. I must say 
that one would have to be an oaf to work up any enthusiasm for 
the Poles of 1772. After all, in most parts of Europe at that time 
the aristocracy was caving in with decency if not esprit,'1 even

though its general maxim may have been that materialism consists 
in what one eats, drinks, fucks, wins at gaming or is paid in return 
for one's knavery; but no aristocracy save the Polish adopted so 
stupid a method as selling itself to the Russians. In other respects, 
the general venality of the gentils-hommes'' all over Europe presents 
a very jolly spectacle. Another thing that greatly interested me was 
the matter of Monsieur Patkul. This fellow was in fact the 
founding father of Russian diplomacy generally, and already 
possessed all its wiles in nuce. h If you haven't been able to procure 
his reports to the Russian government, published in Berlin in 
1795,'  we'll try and get ourselves a copy by advertising in the 
Buchhändlerbörsenblatt. How small, by the way, were the contribu­
tions made by his successors! Always the same turns of speech, 
always the same approach, whatever the country. A necessary 
ingredient, come to that, is the objectivity of your Livonians, 330 
whose interests, far from being national, are at most local and 
private. A Russian would never be capable of such things. 
Another very pretty affair is the coup d'état Catherine II brought 
off against Peter III. It was here Boustrapa 167 learnt his most 
important lessons; the Russian commonness served him as a model 
down to the very last detail. It's ridiculous the way all such dirty 
dealings are invariably repeated in every particular. 
I have no port at present nor is anything good in that line to be 
had ON THE SPUR  OF THE MOMENT. However, I'll look out for some, and 
meanwhile go down into the cellar to fetch up some hock and 
some claret (the former for the healthy, the latter for the invalids).

I would  not  have troubled  you  with this request  if 
1. the  matter were  not an  entirely formal  one,  entailing  no  risk to

had not  unexpectedly  had to go to  Manchester  for  several weeks. 
In addition  to other cases  of illness  in my  family,  I myself have 
been suffering from  my  periodic liver complaint  for  many weeks 
now and  have thus been literally incapable  of writing  a single line. 
Hence  the  delay over  the  work  for the  Society3 which  was  more

for all he cared, the whole Chamber could be triple damned, 
etc. 511 Never has a parliament clung more patiently and more 
inopportunely to the thesis that the bourgeois opposition, in its 
struggle with absolutism and the Junker camarilla, is under an 
obligation to let itself be kicked. It's our old friends of 1848 all 
over again. However, on this occasion times are somewhat 
different. 
Lassalle's goings-on and the rumpus they have created in 
Germany are really becoming obnoxious.332 It's high time you 
finished your book310 ; if only to provide us with propagandists of 
a different kind. In other respects, it's quite a good thing that an 
audience for anti-bourgeois stuff should be recaptured in this way, 
though it's disastrous that friend Izzy should thereby carve out a 
position for  himself.  However, that's something we have never 
been able to prevent, any more than the heroic swordsman's 
postures assumed in public by Karl Blind vis-à-vis the Grand Duke 
of Baden. a 
By the way, if you want to see how much time it takes before 
new scientific discoveries, even in wholly unpolitical fields, make 
any headway, you should read Lyell's Antiquity of Man. Schmerling 
in Liege had discovered the fossilised human skull from Engis and 
shown it to Lyell as far back as 1834, b when he also brought out 
his thick book.' Nevertheless, it was only quite recently that anyone 
thought the thing worthy of serious investigation. Similarly, 
Perthes'1  in Abbeville had correctly identified the flint instruments 
in the Somme basin and their geological age as early as 1842, but 
it was not until the end of the fifties that the thing was noticed. 
Such are those scoundrels, the patriarchs of science. 
Lupus has again suffered severe attacks of gout but is better 
now. 
I am also working hard at Serbian and the ballads collected by 
Vuck  Stef.  Karadzic.e It comes more easily to me than any other 
Slavonic language.

DEAR FREDERICK, 
My long silence will  AT ONCE  be explicable  to you if you  picture  to 
yourself  a badly swollen liver with  AIL ITS 'APPURTENANCES'.  For  ABOUT 
12 weeks  now I  have been enduring more  of this  NONSENSE  than 
ever before.  Nor can you  have  any  conception  of how it  affects  a 
person's morale, namely  the  feeling  of heaviness  in the  head  and 
paralysis  in the  limbs. More specifically,  one  can't bring oneself  to 
do anything,  not  even, inter alia,  to write letters.  For the  past  two 
weeks  the  thing  has  again been endurable. This business  has  made 
writing  of any  kind  so  impossible that, despite various repeated 
attempts,  I have  not  managed  the  stuff  on  Poland,533 which  I'm 
very glad  of now,  since  it would have simply deprived  me of the 
chance  of going  to Prussia without being  of any  immediate benefit. 
Meanwhile  I wasn't,  of course, idle, though unable  to work. 
What  I did, on the one  hand,  was  fill in the  gaps  in my  knowledge 
(diplomatic, historical)  of the  Russian-Prussian-Polish affair534  and, 
on the  other, read  and  make excerpts from  all  kinds  of earlier 
literature relating  to the  part  of the  political economy  I had 
elaborated.535 This at the  BRITISH MUSEUM.  Now that I am more or 
less able  to work again,  I shall cast  the  weight  off my  shoulders 
and make  a fair copy  of the  political economy  for the  printers  (and 
give it a  final polish).  If it  were possible  for me to  retreat into 
isolation  at the  moment,  the  thing would progress very quickly. AT 
ALL EVENTS,  I shall take  it to  Germany  in person.3

Little Jenny is not quite her proper  self.  She has had a nasty 
cough for the past fortnight. 
As to Izzy, he had—or so I've been told in confidence by 
Freiligrath (he showed me Izzy's letter)—asked F. to write a poem 
for him on the 'new' movement,536 i.e. sing Izzy's praises. 
However, he was mistaken in F. In his letter he says inter alia: 
'Each day hundreds of newspapers carry my name to the furthest 
corners of Germany.' 'My proletarians! etc' Well, since F. won't 
sing his praises, he has found another poet. Herewith a sample: 
'Thou German proletariat, come heed 
The clarion call, nor any longer stay! 
Here stands a man prepared to pave the way 
To thy prosperity. Be thine the deed] 
He hath no truck with lofty parliaments, 
Nor doth he flaunt his gift of eloquence, 
Speaks for us all with homely wit and colour, 
Man of the People, Ferdinand Lassalle! 
'Tis not for others, not to fill their purse 
That you shall sweat and toil your lives away, 
While they wax sleek and richer every day 
And you more ragged as your lot grows worse. 
The fruits of labour shall be yours alone, 
'Tis you shall reap the harvest you have sown. 
So hearken all unto the man of valour, 
To the virile voice of Ferdinand LassaUe.' 
Made puerl* If that isn't sauce for the gander! 
My warm regards to Lupus. Now don't indulge in tit for tat but 
let me hear from you soon. 
Salut.

I was very worried by your long silence but have meanwhile 
heard that you were unwell and hope that that is now over. How 
is little Jenny's cough? 
Latterly, things would not seem to have been going so well in 
Poland. The movement in Lithuania and Little Russia is evidently 
weak, nor do the insurgents in Poland seem to be making any 
headway. The leaders are all either killed in action or captured 
and shot, which would, seem to show that they have to expose 
themselves a great deal in order to egg on their men. Qualitatively 
the insurgents are no longer what they were in March and April, 
the best chaps having been expended. However, these Poles are 
always unknown quantities, and affairs might take a turn for the 
better, although the odds against it are worsening. If they hold 
out, they might yet become part of a general European movement 
which would be the saving of them; on the other hand, should 
things go wrong, it will be all up with Poland for the next 10 
years,  for an insurrection like this exhausts a people's fighting 
potential for many years to come. 
I should say that the chances of there being a European 
movement were good because the ordinary citizen has once more 
rid himself of all fear of the communists and might even, if need 
be, go into action with them. The French elections prove this no 
less plainly than do the goings-on in Prussia since the last 
elections.537 However, I scarcely think that a movement of this 
kind would originate in France. The election results in Paris were 
altogether too bourgeois; wherever the workers put up candidates 
of their own, they lost, nor for that matter did they have the 
power to force the bourgeoisie to put up radicals. Besides, 
Bonaparte knows how to keep large cities in check. 
In Prussia they would still be chattering away if the good 
Bismarck hadn't put a stop to it.538 Whatever turn things may take 
there, peaceful constitutional progress is now at an end and your 
philistine must get ready for the fray. And that's enough to be 
going on with. Little though I esteem the valour of our old friends 
the democrats, it is, nevertheless, here more than anywhere else, I 
should say, that combustible material is accumulating and, since it 
is scarcely possible that the Hohenzollerns will fail to perpetrate 
the worst blunders in FOREIGN POLICY, it might well happen that, with 
half the troops deployed at the Polish frontier and the other half 
on the Rhine, Berlin would be left free and a coup would result. It 
would be a poor enough outlook for Germany and Europe were 
Berlin to find itself in the van of the movement. 
What surprises me most is that a peasants' movement should not

have arisen in Greater Russia. In this instance, the Polish uprising 
would seem to have had a positively unfavourable effect. 
In America things are in a pretty pickle. FIGHTING JOE'S" 
rodomontade has made him look a frightful ass,539 Rosecrans 
slumbers and Grant alone is performing well. His move on 
Vicksburg from the south-west to the north-east, his isolation of 
the relief army, his repulse of the same, then the rapid advance on 
Vicksburg and even the energetic if fruitless assaults, are all 
first-class. I do not believe it will be possible to muster enough 
relief troops on time. On the other hand, we have so often seen 
American generals suddenly perform well for a couple of weeks 
and then revert to the most dreadful bungling, that it's quite 
impossible to tell what their future moves will be. 
I was already familiar with Lassalle's poem (genitivus objectivusb ) 
from a pamphlet Siebel sent me and which you presumably have 
as well. Very jolly. The chap's now operating purely in the service 
of Bismarck and, one of these days, wheVi Monsieur B. tires of 
him, he might well find himself under lock and key, making the 
acquaintance of Prussian common law, which he always seems to 
confuse with the Code. 540 It's nice, by the way, that, after the stand 
he took in Vogtibus,25 he should now find himself under the aegis, 
not only of the Augsburger,c  but also of the Kreuz-Zeitung. 
I am now reading Kinglaked and am becoming more convinced 
than ever that somewhere in every Englishman's brain a board is 
nailed up beyond which nothing penetrates.

Dear Engels, 
I hereby acknowledge the £10 with many thanks. Being 
uncertain whether you would be able to send the money 
for Monday, and in view of the great fear of bills of exchange 
which obtains in this house, I had simultaneously written to 
Dronke.42 
For the past four weeks little Jenny has again had a slight 
cough. Today I sent her to see Dr Allen. 
I myself am not quite fit either, but am rid of my worst 
complaint.3  IN THE MEANTIME, which would certainly delight Vogt, I 
have been wolfing sulphur! 54' 
Izzy has sent me (and you, too, perhaps) the speech he made in 
court about indirect taxation!1  One or two individual bits are good, 
but for one thing it is, on the whole, written in an unbearably 
officious, chatty style, with absurd pretensions to scholarship and 
consequentialness. In addition, it is essentiellement the confection of 
a 'pupil' who cannot wait to make a name for himself as a 
'thoroughly learned' man and original scholar. Hence the abun­
dance of historical and theoretical BLUNDERS. One examplp may 
suffice (should you not have read the thing yourself). To impress 
the court and the public, he tries to give a kind of retrospective 
history of the argument against indirect taxation and therefore, 
going back at random beyond Boisguillebert and Vau ban, cites 
Bodin,' etc. And here he shows himself to be the schoolboy par 
excellence.  He omits the physiocrats, clearly ignorant of the fact that 
everything A. Smith, etc., wrote on the subject was cribbed from 
them and that in general they were the protagonists where this 
'QUESTION' was concerned. Likewise, 'indirect taxation' is, in true 
schoolboy fashion, seen as 'bourgeois taxation', and so indeed it 
was 'in the Middle Ages', but not today (not, at least, where the

bourgeoisie  is developed),  to discover which  he need seek  no 
further than  Mr R.  Gladstone  et co. in  Liverpool. 542 The  jackass 
doesn't appear  to know that  the  argument against 'indirect' 
taxation  is one of the  platforms  of the  English  and  American 
friends  of 'Schulze-Delitzsch'  et cie, and hence isn't  at any  rate 
directed against them — the FREETRADERS, 543 I mean. Again,  in true 
schoolboy fashion  he  applies  a proposition  of Ricardo's  to the 
Prussian real estate  tax.  (Quite wrong, this.) Quite touching,  how 
he imparts  to the  court  'his'  discoveries,  the  fruit  of the  most 
profound 'learning  and  truth'  and of  terrible 'night vigils', namely 
that, 
in the  Middle Ages 'landed property' prevailed, 
in later times 'capital',  and at  present 
the 'principle  of the  workers' estate', 'labour',  or the  'moral 
principle  of labour';  and, on the  same  day as he was  imparting this 
discovery  to the  louts,466  Senior Councillor  to the  Government 
Engel (knowing nothing about  him) was  imparting  it to a  more 
distinguished audience  at the  Academy  of Singing."  He and  Engel 
exchanged 'epistolary' congratulations upon their 'simultaneous' 
scientific findings. 
The 'workers' estate'  and the  'moral principle'  are  indeed 
achievements  on the  part  of Izzy  and the  Senior Councillor  to the 
Government. 
I have  not  been able  to bring myself  to write  to the  fellow since 
the beginning  of this year. 
If I commented  on his stuff, I'd be  wasting  my time; besides,  he 
appropriates every word  as a  'discovery'.  To rub his  nose  in his 
plagiarism would  be absurd since,  in view  of the  state they  are in 
after  he has  finished with them,  I have  no desire  to relieve  him of 
our ideas.  Nor  would  it do to  accord recognition  to such 
rodomontade  and  indiscretions.  The  fellow would instantly exploit 
it. 
So, there's nothing  to be  done  but  wait until  he ultimately boils 
over. Then  I shall have  a very nice excuse, namely that (like 
Senior Councillor  to the  Government Engel)  he is for  ever 
insisting  it's not  'communism'.  So, in my  reply,  I shall  say  that,  had 
I wished  to take  any  notice  of him,  these repeated asseverations  of 
his would have compelled  me 
1. to show  the  public  how and  where  he had  cribbed from  us; 
2. how and  wherein  we  differ from  his stuff.

Hence, so as not to compromise 'communism' in any way or 
injure him, I had ignored him completely. 
Come to that, the chap is making all this hullabaloo out of sheer 
vanity. Throughout 1859 he was heart and soul for the Prussian 
liberal bourgeois party. Now he may find it more convenient to 
attack the 'bourgeois' under the AUSPICES OF THE GOVERNMENT than to 
attack the 'Russians'. To rail against the Austrians and adulate the 
Italians has always been as typical of your Berliner as to keep one's

Things are going rottenly in Poland. The Polish government's 
grand effect, the mass uprising in June, has obviously come to 
grief544  owing to a shortage of weapons and, failing any external

Your policy in regard to Izzy is quite right." Besides, what's the 
use of all this camaraderie towards a chap who either finds himself 
compelled by circumstances to go along with us at a crucial

Palmerston PLAYS HIS OLD TRICKS in the Polish affair." The Notes 
presented to the Russians had originally been sent from 
St. Petersburg to London. b Pam bought Hennessy from Urquhart by 
giving the said Irish blackguard a remunerative post (sinecure) 
with a Franco-English railway in France. Indeed, the venality of 
the POLITICIANS here eclipses anything that goes on in that line on 
the Continent. No one at home or in France can have any 
conception of this absolute shamelessness. As for 'COUNT Zamoyski', 
I had repeatedly told the Urquhartites that the fellow betrayed the 
Poles in 1830/31 by leading an intact corps across the Austrian 
border instead of against the Russians. In the end, this fellow has 
aroused their suspicions because of his perpetual personal 
underhand dealings with Pam.c 
The SOUTHERNERS' expedition against the North543  was, in my 
opinion, forced on Lee by the clamour of the Richmond  PAPERS  and 
their SUPPORTERS. I regard it as a coup de désespoir? This war, by the 
by, is going to be a lengthy business, which is, so far as European 
interests are concerned, altogether desirable. 
Izzy has sent me yet another pamphlet, his speech at Frankfurt 
am Main.e Since I now spend 10 hours a day working ex officio at 
economics,310 I can hardly be expected to waste my leisure hours 
on reading these schoolboy essays. So, for the present the thing's 
been filed away. My spare time is now devoted to differential and 
integral calculus. Apropos, I have a superfluity of works on the 
subject and will send you one, should you wish to tackle it. I 
should consider it Jo be almost essential to your military studies. 
Moreover, it is a much easier branch of mathematics (so far as 
mere technicalities are concerned) than, say, the more advanced 
aspects of algebra. Save for a knowledge of the more ordinary 
kind of algebra and trigonometry, ho preliminary study is 
required except a general familiarity with conic sections.

If at all possible in this heat, will you take a reasonably close 
look at the enclosed. 'Tableau Économique' which I am substituting 
for Quesnay's table 546 and let me know your objections, if any. It 
embraces the whole process of reproduction. 
As you know, A. Smith sees the -NATURAL' or  -NECESSARY  PRICE-  as 
being composed of wages, profit (interest) and rent—i.e. as wholly 
resolved into revenue. This nonsense has been taken over by 
Ricardo, although he excludes rent from the catalogue as being 
purely fortuitous. Nearly all economists have taken this over from 
Smith, and those who contest it succumb to some other folly. 
Smith himself is conscious of the nonsensicality of subsuming 
the gross product of a society simply under revenue (which may be 
consumed annually), whereas in' the case of each individual branch 
of production he resolves price into capital (raw materials, 
machinery, etc.) and revenue (wages, profit, rent). If this were so, a 
society would have to start each year de novo, 1" without capital. 
Now as regards my table, which figures in one of the last 
chapters of my work by way of recapitulation, the following is 
essential to a proper understanding of it: 
1. The figures, which are arbitrary, represent millions. 
2. Here means of subsistence are taken to mean everything that 
goes into the consumption fund each year (or might without 
accumulation, which is excluded from the table, go into the 
consumption fund). 
In Class I (means of subsistence) the gross product (700) consists 
of means of subsistence which are, by their very nature, not 
therefore included in constant capital (raw materials and machin­
ery, buildings, etc.). Similarly, in Class II, the entire product consists 
of commodities that constitute constant capital, i. e. re-enter the 
process of reproduction in the form of raw materials and 
machinery. 
3. Ascending lines are  dotted,  descending ones continuous. 
4. Constant capital is that part of capital that consists of raw 
materials and machinery. Variable capital that which is exchanged 
for labour. 
5. For example, in agriculture, etc., one part of the same 
product (e.g. wheat) goes to form means of subsistence, whereas 
another part (wheat, for instance) re-enters reproduction in its 
natural form (e.g. as seed) as a raw material. But this does nothing 
to alter the case, since such branches of production figure under 
Class II or Class I according to which capacity is involved. 
a afresh

6. The hub of the  matter, then,  is as  follows: 
Category  I. Means  of  subsistence. Working materials  and 
machinery=e.g. £400  (i.e.  that part  of these that  is included  in the 
annual product  as déchet"; that part  of the  machinery,  etc.,  which 
is not  used  up does  not  figure  at all in the  table).  The  variable 
capital exchanged  for  labour = 100, reproduces itself  as 300,  since 
100 replaces wages  in the  shape  of the  product,  and 200 
represents surplus value (unpaid surplus labour).  The  product=700, 
of which  400  represents  the  value  of the  constant capital which, 
however,  has  passed entirely into  the  product  and  must hence  be 
replaced. 
In the  case  of this relationship between variable capital  and 
surplus value  it is  assumed that  the  worker works  '/a of the 
working day for himself and 2 /ä for his  NATURAL  SUPERIORS. 
Hence  100  (variable capital),  as is  indicated  by the  dotted line,  is 
paid out in  money  as wages; with this  100  (indicated  by the 
descending line)  the  worker buys  the  product  of this class,  i.e. 
means  of subsistence  for 100.  Thus,  the  money flows back  to 
capitalist class  I. 
The surplus value  of 200 in its  general form = profit, which, 
however,  is split  up into industrial profit (commercial included),  and 
further into interest, which  the  industrial capitalist pays  in money, 
and rent, which  he likewise pays  in money. This money paid  out 
for industrial profit, interest  and  rent, flows back (indicated  by 
descending lines) since  the  product  of class  I is  bought  in return 
for it. Hence  all the  money laid  out by the  industrial capitalist 
within class  I flows back  to him,  while  300 of the  product,  700, is 
consumed  by the  workers, entrepreneurs, MONIED MEN  and  LANDLORDS. 
In class  I this leaves  a surplus  of products  (of means  of subsistence) 
of 400, and a  deficit  of constant capital  of 400. 
Category  II. Machinery  and raw  materials. 
Since  the  gross product  of this category,  not  only that part  of the 
product which replaces constant capital,  but  also that which 
represents  the  equivalent  of wages  and  surplus value, consists  of 
raw materials  and  machinery,  the  revenue  of this category cannot 
be realised  in its own  product  but  only  in the  product  of category 
I. Disregarding accumulation,  as is  done here, category  I can, 
however,  buy  only  as much from category  II as it  needs  for the 
replacement  of its  constant capital, while category  II can lay out 
on the  product  of category  I only that part  of its  product which 
represents wages  and  surplus value (revenue). Hence  the  workers 
a depreciation 

=====第523页=====
292. Marx to Engels. 6 July 1863 487 
in category II lay out their money, = 133 Vs, on the product of 
category II. The same thing happens with the surplus value in 
category II, which, as sub I. is split up into industrial profit, interest, 
and rent. Hence 400 in money flows from category II to the 
industrial capitalists in category I, who, in return, transfer the 
remainder of their product, =400, to the former. 
With this 400 in money, class I buys what is necessary to replace 
its constant capital, =400, from category II, to which the money 
paid out in wages and consumption (by the industrial capitalists 
themselves, the MOWED MEN and the LANDLORDS) thus flows back. 
Hence category II retains 533'/3 of its gross product, and, with 
this, it replaces its own constant capital, which has been used up. 
The movement, partly within category I, partly between 
categories I and II, also shows how money flows back to the 
respective industrial capitalists in both categories, money which 
will again go to pay wages, interest and rent. 
Category HI represents reproduction as a whole. 
The gross product of category II is shown here as the constant 
capital of society as a whole, and the gross product of category I as 
that part of the product which replaces the variable capital (the 
wages fund) and the revenues of the classes which share the 
surplus value between them. 
I have put Quesnay's table underneath and will explain it in SOME 
WORDS in my next letter.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 15 August 1863 
DEAR  Frederick, 
May the devil take me, as the red onea used to say, if I didn't 
get up every morning this week with the firm intention of writing 
to you. But no sooner did I reach my study than I allayed my 
conscience by pleading that all I wanted was to add half a dozen 
lines to the manuscript at the point where I had broken off the 
day before.547 And once I had departed from the path of 
righteousness, I saw that the evil deed is accursed in that it must 
constantly engender evil.b 
My family left for Hastings last Friday.548 The departure took 
place so tardily because Lenchen had had to spend a fortnight in 
Germany in connection with family affairs. 
The enclosed photographs549 (the children forced me to have 
mine taken) will soon be followed by those of Jenny and Laura. 
In one respect, my work (preparing the manuscript for the 
press) is going well. In the final elaboration the stuff is, I think, 
assuming a tolerably popular form, aside from a few unavoidable 
M—C's and  C — M's. c On the other hand, despite the fact that I 
write all day long, it's not getting on as fast as my own impatience, 
long subjected to a trial of patience, might demand. At all events, it 
will be 100 p. c. more comprehensible than No. l.d When, by the 
by, I consider my handiwork and realise how I've had to demolish 
everything and even build up the historical sectione out of what 
was in part quite unknown material, I can't help finding Izzy a bit 
of a joke; for he has already got 'his' political economy in hand 
and yet everything he has peddled around hitherto has shown him 
to be a callow schoolboy who trumpets abroad as his very latest 
discovery, with the most repulsive and impertinent garrulity, 
theses that we were doling out 20 years ago as small change to our 
PARTISANS, and ten times better at that. In other respects, too, this

same Izzy  is storing  up in his  MANURE factory  our  party faeces 
excreted  20 years  ago  which  he proposes  to use as  fertilizer  for 
world history. Thus,  for  instance,  he got the  Nordstern  to print  a 
letter  of support from 'Herwegh'  (who has  undoubtedly given 
proof  of his  platonic love  of the  'principle  of labour'). 3 Because  the 
same Nordstern  is edited  by  that ne'er-do-we'el Bruhn, whom 
Lassalle bought from Blind. Thus, Izzy  has  nominated  'Moses  Hess' 
his 'proconsul  in the  Rhine Province',  etc. And he  still seems 
unable  to shake  off the  idée fixe that his  praises should  be sung  by 
Freiligrath,  who  would never dream  of doing  so. For he has  again 
got his  Leipzig 'proconsul' b to SUMMON  F. urgently, citing  the  good 
example  of G.  Herwegh.  If only  he  knew  how F. and I had 
laughed about this renewed onslaught! 
'Oh Izzy,  Oh  Izzy, didst thou  not see 
That  Herwegh  and  Moses  thy  gallows would  be?' 
The philistines down here  are  furious with  The  Times  for 
having fobbed them  off so  nicely over  the  CONFEDERATE LOAN.550 
After  all,  those worthies might have known  if only from Cobbett's 
disclosures, that  The  Times  is nothing  but a  'COMMERCIAL  CONCERN', 
which doesn't give  a damn  how the  BALANCE  turns  out,  providing  it 
is a BALANCE  IN ITS OWN  FAVOUR.551  The  Times chaps, such  as 
/. Spence—'THAT  MAN',  according  to the  Richmond Enquirer,  'WHOM  WE 
HAVE PAID  IN SOLID  GOLD'—obtained  the  LOAN SCRIPS  partly for nothing, 
partly  at a 50 p. c.  DISCOUNT  on the  nominal rate.  So, to cry  them 
up till they reached  105 was a  nice piece  of business. 
It is, I  should  say, of  prime importance  to the  UNITED  STATES  that 
they should seize  the  remaining ports, Charleston, Mobile,  etc., 
because they  may be  involved  in a  clash with Boustrapa 167  any day 
now. That same imperial Lazarillo  de Tormes  is presently 
caricaturing,  not  only  his  uncle, c but  even  himself.  For  after  all, 
the 'SUFFRAGE'  in Mexico  is a  pretty caricature,  not  only  of the 
SUFFRAGE  whereby  he turned himself into  a Frenchman,  but  also  of 
that whereby  he made Nice  and  Savoy French.552  I myself  am in 
no doubt that Mexico will  be the  hurdle  at which he'll break  his 
neck, provided  he hasn't been hanged first. 
The Polish affair  has  gone completely  off the  rails because  of 
this same Boustrapa,  and the  influente  his intrigues have given 
the Czartoryski party. Colonel Lapinski,  who  returned  a few  days

Apropos. Since you wrote your book about England,3 a second 
Children's Employment Commission Reportb has at long last appeared. It 
shows that all those horrors that were banished from certain 
spheres of industry by the FACTORY ACTS, have proliferated with 
redoubled vigour wherever there is no control! It would make a 
splendid sequel to your book, once the complete reports have 
come out. 
My congratulations to Gumpert. At any rate, he has seen to it 
that his marriage did not remain childless. 
In Borchardt's case, the flesh would appear to be more urgent 
than befits his priestly office. And he'll make all the other Jewesses 
jealous. 
Is Lupus back? If so, give him my kindest regards. There's 
nothing I should like better just now than to have you here for a 
couple of days so that I could chat and go drinking with you. It's 
such a long time since we were together.

Dear Frederick, 
My family has been back for ABOUT 10 days.b Little Jenny is 
much better and has stopped coughing. She is now taking salt 
water baths at home, i.e. baths with sea salt. ABOUT 2 months ago I, 
too, started taking a bath at home every morning, sluicing myself 
with cold water from head to foot, since when I have been feeling 
much better. 
The most interesting acquaintanceship I have struck up here is 
that of Colonel iMpinski. He is without doubt the cleverest 
Pole — besides being an homme d'action' — I have ever met. His 
sympathies are all on the German side, though in manners and 
speech he is also a Frenchman. He cares nothing for the national 
struggle and only knows the racial struggle. He hates all Orientals, 
among whom he numbers Russians, Turks, Greeks, Armenians, 
etc., with equal impartiality. He spent some time here in company 
with Urquhart, but, not content with describing him as a 'humbug', 
he actually doubts his probity, which is unjust. 
The 'Circassian' princes exhibited in England by Urquhart and 
Lapinski'1 were two—menials. Lapinski maintains that Urquhart is 
being well and truly led by the nose by Zamoyski, who in turn is 
himself simply a tool of Palmerston's and hence, by this circuitous 
route, of the Russian Embassy. Although of Catholic stock, he 
(Lap.) finds Urquhart's relations with the Catholic bishops in 
a Discoveries in the field of politics, war, literature, theology, medicine, chemistry. -

England highly suspect.  As  soon  as 'action'  was  called  for, he 
says,—e.g.  the  equipping  of a  Polish corps  to invade Circassia, 504 
which  -L., too,  regards  as the  best diversion—Urquhart allowed 
himself  to be  dissuaded  by Zamoyski.  By and  large, Urquhart only 
wants  to 'talk'.  He is a 'big  liar' and he  (<Lap.) took  it particularly 
amiss that  he  should have made  him  (•£,.)  his  co-liar without 
consulting  him  beforehand.  Not a  soul  in  Circassia knows 
Urquhart,  who  spent only  24 hours there  and  doesn't speak  the 
language.  By way of  illustrating  U.'s  imaginative powers,  he 
mentioned  the  latter's boast that  he (Urq.)  had  killed Chartism  in 
England! 
There  has  been another purge  of the  National Government  in 
Warsaw.555 This  had  been infiltrated  by Czartoryski's supporters  as 
a result  of the  intrigues  of Bonaparte  and  Palmerston. Three  of 
these were stabbed  and  that,  pro  nunc?  has  intimidated  the  rest. 
(The said Czartoryski party  was  headed  by Majewski.b ) The  power 
of the  National Government  is evident from  the  fact that  the 
Grand Duke Constantine accepted  a passport from  it for a  journey 
abroad. According  to -£..,  Herzen  and Bakunin  are  thoroughly 
cHAPFALLEN because your Russian, upon being scratched  a little,  has 
again revealed himself  to be a  Tartar. 
Bakunin has become a monster,  A HUGE  MASS  OF FLESH  AND  FAT,  and is 
barely capable  of walking  any  more.  To crown  it all, he is  sexually 
perverse  and  jealous  of the  seventeen year-old Polish girl 
who married  him in  Siberia because  of his  martyrdom/  He is 
presently  in Sweden, where  he is  hatching 'revolution' with  the 
Finns. 553 
In Poland,  £,. said,  it had  been necessary  de prime  abord d to 
disregard  the  peasantry, that 'ultra-reactionary rabble'.  But  they 
were  now  ripe  for the  fray and  would rise  at the  government's call 
for a levée  en masse." 
Without Austria,  he went  on, the  movement would have come 
to grief long  ago and, if  Austria were  to close  her  frontiers 
in earnest,  the  rebellion would  be  done  for in 3  weeks.  But 
Austria  was  cheating  the  Poles. Solely  out of  desperation, because 
Francis Joseph knew that  he was  threatened  by a  Russian-Serbian-
Romanian-Italian-French-Hungarian-Prussian bomb  did he go to 
Frankfurt,  and it was for the  same reason that  the  Popef  had 
issued  his  latest edict  in support  of Poland.556

His aim now is to raise a German legion in London, even if only 
200 strong, so that he can confront the Russians in Poland with 
the black, red and gold flag,170 partly to 'exasperate' the Parisians, 
partly to see whether there is any possibility whatsoever of 
bringing the Germans in Germany back to their senses. 
What's lacking is money. Efforts are being made down here to 
exploit all the German societies, etc., to this end. You must be the

suddenly finding the Schleswig-Holstein question so absolutely 
crystal-clear, when for years it has claimed it was so complicated 
that, as Dundreary a says, 'NO EELLOW CAN UNDERSTAND THAT'. For us, 
however, the admissions in the English press suffice. But what a 
masterly stroke the Protocol of 1852 was on the Russians' part! So 
long as my only source of information was the stupid Free  Press,  I 
couldn't make head or tail of it; really, the gift those jackasses 
have for confusing everything surpasses even Dundreary's. That 
Prussia and Austria should have signed the Protocol was an 
unspeakable infamy, and those concerned must pay for it with 
their blood. 
Again, it's really rather funny that the whole question of the 
succession should now turn on whether the Augustenburg fellow, 
as the child of a morganatic marriage, is qualified to succeed. 338 
In Prussia, Bismarck's insolence would seem to be wavering a bit 
after all. The disavowal of the Landrat election intrigues, and the 
repeal of the Press Decree are significant omens. 539 J'espère qu'ils ne

DEAR FREDERICK, 
Two hours ago a telegram arrived, saying my mothera was dead. 
Fate laid claim to one of our family. I myself have already had one 
foot in the grave. Circumstances being what they were, I, 
presumably, was needed more than my mater. 
I have got to go to Trier to settle the question of the legacy. 
Was in much doubt as to what Allen would say, as it is only 3 days 
since I first began taking a recuperative WALK of half an hour a 
day. 
However, Allen has given me 2 enormous bottles of medicine 
to take with me and actually thinks it advisable for me to go. The 
wound hasn't stopped discharging yet, but all along the route I 
should find good Samaritanessesb to apply the plaster for me. 
I must now ask you to send me enough money by return to 
enable me to leave for Trier forthwith.

compatriots' Schleswig-Holstein enthusiasm won't spoil your visit 
too much. I've swotted up the whole question 324 and have come to 
the conclusion 
1. that the Schi.-Holst, theory is a lot of rubbish; 
2. that in Holstein the Augustenburg fellow would certainly 
seem to be in the right 558; 
3. that in Schleswig it's difficult to say who is entitled to 
succeed—but the male line, if at all, only as Denmark's vassal; 
4. that the London Protocol is certainly valid in Denmark, but is 
certainly not so in Schleswig and Holstein because the Estates were 
not consulted; 
5. that the German right to Schleswig is confined to the south, 
which is German by nationality and free choice, so that Schleswig 
would have to be partitioned; 
6. that at present Germany's only chance of liberating the 
Duchies lies in our starting a war against Russia for the benefit of 
Poland.  Then Louis Napoleon would be our obedient servant, 
Sweden would instantly throw herself into our arms, and England, 
hoc est3 Pam, would be hamstrung; then we could take anything we 
liked from Denmark with impunity. 
THEM IS MY SENTIMENTS. I'd like to enlarge upon them in a

Dear Frederick, 
Very many thanks for the £10. Ditto, retrospectively, for the 
port. It has done me a power of good. Besides the wine, I have 
(up till now) been having to swill f/2 quarts of the strongest 
London STOUT every day. It struck me as a good theme for a short 
story. From the front, the man who regales HIS INNER  MAN with port, 
claret, stout and a truly massive mass of meat. From the front, the 
guzzler. But behind, on his back, the  OUTER  MAN,  a damned 
carbuncle. If the devil makes a pact with one to sustain one with 
consistently good fare in circumstances like these, may the devil 
take the devil, I say. Incidentally, I still feel light-headed and my 
knees are those of a broken-down hack, but I imagine the journey 
will put a stop to all this. Little Tussy told me apropos the OUTER 
MAN: 'BUI IT  IS YOUR  OWN  FLESH!' By the by, I can't speak too highly of 
Dr Allen's behaviour towards me. He remarked, by the by, 
apropos the operation, that GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS were always 
self-consistent. 
As regards the 'sea-girt',a by and large, I agree with you.b 
Obviously, the whole succession business is merely of diplomatic 
significance. As TO DENMARK, she is not, I think, bound by the 
Treaty of London38n in as much as the Danish Parliament was 
intimidated by Russian warships when the vote was taken. I 
enclose herewith Urquhart's nonsense,1  R. Schramm's nonsense, 11

stand taken by the peasants in Holstein.

If I have been so long in writing to you, this was certainly not 
out of forgetfulness. Quite the reverse. I have made a daily 
pilgrimage to the old Westphalen home (in the Neustrasse), which 
interested me more than any Roman antiquities 3fi2 because it 
reminded me of the happiest days of my youth and had 
harboured my greatest treasure. Moreover, every day and on 
every side I am asked about the quondam'1 'most beautiful girl in 
Trier' and the 'queen of the ball'. It's damned pleasant for a man, 
when his wife lives on like this as an 'enchanted princess' in the 
imagination of a whole town. 
The reason I didn't write was that every day I hoped to have 
something definite to say, but up to this moment don't yet know 
of anything definite. For this is how matters stand. On my arrival 
I naturally found everything under seal save for such furniture as 
was in daily use. My mother, with her usual mania for assuming 
'supreme command', had told Conradi not to bother about 
anything; she had so arranged matters that Uncle would see to 
'everything'. What she gave Conradi was a notarial copy of a sort 
of will, which contained nothing but the following terms: 1. She 
left all the furniture and linen to Emilie 13 with the exception of the 
gold- and silverware; 2. To her son Carl she leaves the 1,100 talers, 
etc.; 3. To Sophie, 1 father's portrait. That's all there is to the will. 
(NB:  Sophie has 1,000 talers a year, for the most part given her by 
the Philipses. So, after all, you see, my relations are decent 'folk'.) 
Apart from this scrap of paper, my mother had lodged another 
(now invalid) legally attested will. This was of an earlier date and 
was nullified by the more recent will. It had been drawn up before 
Emilie's marriage. In it she had made Emilie the beneficiary of 
everything of which she was entitled to dispose. In addition, she 
had appointed Uncle Martin' 1 and Uncle Philips her executors. 
She—or rather her bibulous notary Zell (deceased)—forgot to 
repeat this clause relating to executors in the scrap of paper which 
now alone is valid and which I have described above, so that if 
Uncle is the executor, it is only thanks to our bonne grace? (For 
which I, of course, have my own 'reasons'.) As yet, I know nothing 
about the actual value of the estate, because all the papers are in 
the sealed cupboard. The seals have not yet been removed because 
of the time-consuming formalities that have to be gone through 
before the Dutch powers of attorney (for Juta f and Sophie) can 
arrive here. So far as I am concerned this will take too long. I am

therefore giving Conradi power of attorney. Besides, there's 
nothing left here in Trier (Grünberg 563 was sold long ago) except 
5 casks of 1858 wine, which my mother refused to sell at the right 
moment, and some gold- and silverware. This will be shared out 
equally among the heirs. The real assets, however, are all in 
Uncle's hands. 
My mother died at 4 in the afternoon of 30 November, on the 
very day and at the very hour of her marriage. She had predicted 
that she would die at that time. 
Today I am attending to the things for Mr Demuth and 
Lieschen. I shall write to you at greater length from Frankfurt or 
Bommel. Greetings and much love to everyone. Above all and in 
particular, please give the CHINESE SUCCESSOR" a thousand kisses on

Zalt-Bommel, 22 December 1863 
Dear Engels, 
You will see from the address that I am back in Holland, where 
I arrived safely yesterday. In Trier, where the papers and effects 
left by my mother had been placed under seal, the unsealing could 
not take place because the Dutch powers of attorney, which must 
pass through the hands of an endless succession of authorities,

had not yet arrived. I left a power of attorney for my 
brother-in-law Conradi for submission to the Department of Trier 
and proceeded to headquarters here, firstly because my uncle3 
holds by far the largest part of the assets, secondly because he is 
the executor of the will. However, in any case it will be another 
5-6 weeks before I receive payment of the money. Since my wife 
has to pay a butcher's BILL for £10 on 10 January 1864 (i.e. a bill of 
exchange),  I should be very glad if you could attend to it. 
The carbuncle has gone the way of all flesh, but now for good 
measure my back is wickedly plagued with furuncles and last 
night, for example, thanks to these pestilential objects, I couldn't 
get a wink of sleep which would, after all, only have been fair 
after travelling here from Frankfurt a.M. The husbandb of a 
cousin' of mine is the town's only doctor and medical officer of 
health, so I am not in want of Aesculapian assistance. 
Throughout the Rhine Province, from Trier to Frankfurt a.M. 
and thence via Giessen and Cologne right up to the Dutch 
frontier, I heard nothing but abuse of Prussia. Little, very little, 
Schleswig-Holsteinianism. For the most part, it was regarded as 
'Prussian artfulness'. 
I spent only one day in Frankfurt (where I had to visit two old 
auntsd) and hence wasn't able to see any publishers. However, I 
spoke to an acquaintance who will write to me here (after he has 
consulted with a publisher on my behalf) .e 
When writing your pamphlet/ it might be better if you were 
now to include some actual events as well, not forgetting the 
systematic blunders perpetrated by the Prussian government, the 
men of Progress371  and the regular—since 1815 inveterate—

Dear Freiligrath, 
Your letter arrived today, having been sent on to Trier by my 
wife and from Trier to this address by my sister.b I left London 
two days after you called (on Mondayc). Otherwise, I should have 
had to keep traipsing into the CITY to see to the issue of powers of 
attorney for the executors of the will, which, in view of my 
physical condition at the time, would have been more irksome 
than a sea-crossing. 
'Dr Liebknecht' has been living in Berlin for about a year now. 
His address is: 13 Neuenburger Strasse. I know nothing about the 
affair. SM But one thing surprises me about the bookseller. He 
continued to pay Wilhelm Liebkn. the fees on behalf of the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung throughout the time L. was its 
correspondent. Hence it was in his power to deduct L.'s debt. 
It was inexcusable of L., no matter what the circumstances, to 
make improper use of your name. But you have no responsibility 
whatever towards the bookseller, since Williams could have 
recovered the money  himself. 
Warmest regards.

IN MANCHESTER 
Zalt-Bommel, 27 December 1863 
DEAR FREDERICK, 
I wrote and told you last Wednesday about the recurrence of 
my furunculosis and the 'bitter' night I passed.3  The next day 
Dr van Anrooij discovered that a damned carbuncle had reappeared 
beside the furuncles, almost exactly beneath the site of the old 
one. Ever since then—leaving aside the ill-effects of such a 
discovery on one's morale—I have been in loathsome pain for 
much of the time, particularly at night. My uncle, b a splendid old 
BOY, applies my poultices and cataplasms with his own hands, while 
my charming and witty cousin' with the dangerously dark eyes 
nurses and cossets me in exemplary fashion. Nevertheless, in view 
of these circumstances, I would gladly set out for HOME, but that is 
temporarily out of the question on physical grounds. The Dr has 
opened up the agreeable prospect of my being troubled by this 
loathsome complaint until well into January. He will tell me when 
my condition permits a removal to London. However, this second 
Frankenstein on my back is less ferocious  BY FAR than was the first 
one in London, as you will already have gathered from the fact of 
my being able to write. 
I gave up smoking completely 2  V2 months ago and it's unlikely 
that I'll start again very soon. 
Anyone wishing to spew up politics in disgust should take it 
daily in the form of the telegraphic pills dispensed by the small 
Dutch newspapers. 
However, we are in for a spectacle, and the comical thing so far 
as Germany is concerned is that it will start with a movement in 
favour of the 'legitimate' duke,d accompanied by clamorous 
requests for a 36th potentate.''''' 
Those scoundrelly parliamentary cretins, who had assembled in 
Frankfurt a.M., set aside without debate a resolution moved by a 
German from Posen in which the TRUE QUESTION between Germany 
and Russia was presented in highly comprehensive and rational 
form. 51*

Manchester, 3 January 1864 
Dear Moor, 
The many CHRISTMAS drinking-sprees and consequent GENERAL 
UNFITNESS  FOR  BUSINESS  have rendered me utterly incapable of replying 
any sooner. However, the affair is now happily over. 
I am sending your wife the amount in question/ For the rest, 
I'm delighted to hear that your second carbuncle has been 
operated on, and that you are thus over this latter crisis. You'll 
have got damned thin as a result of this tedious business. 
The Schleswig-Holstein affair has come off the rails again good 
and proper. If, as I believe, there's war in the spring, we shall 
have Denmark, Sweden, France and Italy against us and, possibly, 
England. In Hungary and Poland Plonplonism, 524 to which Kossuth 
had already pointed the way, is in full swing.567 I see only two ways 
out here: 1. either revolution in Berlin as soon as the troops have 
left and, in Vienna, a corresponding movement with concessions 
of an adequate kind to Hungary and, perhaps, also to Poland. 
That's what would be most favourable, and there would be 
nothing to fear in such a case. But it is also what is most 
improbable, in view of the confusion that prevails. Or, alternative­
ly, 2. a restoration of the Holy Alliance511 for which, as always, the 
partition of Poland would provide the cement (Russia has a 
greater interest in Poland than in Denmark and also the prospect, 
come the armistice, of having Austria and Prussia under her 
thumb, i.e. being able to impose her own conditions).

Then the Russians would take over from the Prussians in Berlin 
and play the policeman, whereat we would be done for, and 
Bonaparte cock of the walk. 
The mock war in Schleswig under Wrangel can't last very 
long. 568 In the first place, the Danish fortifications will make even 
tlie initial encounters too bloody and, in the second, Boustrapa 167 
is too much in need of a popular war not to seize this opportunity. 
What more could he ask than the restoration of the Holy Alliance 
and a war for both Poland and the Rhine with, for good measure, 
England and Italy and all the small states of Europe on his side? 
Apropos. Our worthy Faucher, who shows himself a rabid 
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg man in the 
Chamber," is, at the same time, sending The Manchester Guardian 
anti-German articles in which he arse-licks to the English bastards 
of The Times. Shouldn't one do something to unmask this louse? 
If the curs in the Prussian Chamber were now to take their 
courage in both hands, they could straighten things out to their 
own satisfaction within the space of 6 weeks. Handsome William's 
reply shows what a fix the government is in.569  No one will fork 
out, not even the worthy von der Heydt, and they know they 
won't get any money par force!'

IN MANCHESTER 
Zalt-Bommel, 20 January 1864 
Dear Frederick, 
As you see, I am still here and 'let me tell you something else, 
Sir', I am in fact once more unable TO  MOVE  ABOUT This is a disease 
of truly Christian perfidiousness. When I got your letter, I was 
congratulating myself on the way the old wounds had healed, but 
that self-same evening a large furuncle erupted just below my 
neck on the left-hand side of my chest and, antipodally to it, one 
on my back. Although irksome, it did not, at least, prevent me 
from walking and, in fact, I accompanied my uncle and cousin  " on 
a stroll across the Rhine (Waal). But a few days later, yet another 
carbuncle appeared on my right leg, close beneath the spot of 
which Goethe says: 'And if the noble fellow has no bum, on what 
does he propose to sit?'b  Now this is the most painful and 
embarrassing boil I have had so far, and I trust will be the last of 
a long series. In the meantime, I can neither walk, stand, nor sit, 
and find even lying down damned difficult. So you see, mon cher, 
how nature in her wisdom is persecuting me. Would she not be-
better advised to inflict these trials of patience upon a good 
Christian — someone of the same stamp as Silvio Pellico? Besides 
the carbuncle beneath my buttock, I should inform you that 
another furuncle has erupted on my back, while the one on my 
chest has only just begun to heal so that, like a veritable Lazarus 
(alias Lassalle), I am assailed on all sides at once. 
Apropos Lazarus, I am reminded of Renan's Life of Jesus which 
is, in many respects, simply a novel full of pantheistic-mystical 
extravaganzas. However, the book also has some advantages over 
its German predecessors and, since it isn't long, you ought to read 
it. It is, of course, a derivative of the German  stuff.  Most 
remarkable. Here in Holland the German critico-theological 
tendency is so much à l'ordre du jour 1 that the clergy openly 
profess it from the pulpit. 
As regards the Schleswig-Holstein affair, I hope that it will lead 
to clashes in Germany  itself. 5'1 How well Russia knows her

The German petty princes are taking the fiction of the 
Schleswig-Holstein movement very seriously. They genuinely 
believe that Germania cannot have enough of them and is 
therefore intent on enthroning a 35th. c 
I am writing you no more than a short letter, and that only with 
great effort, since it's agony for me to sit. But I shall expect an 
early reply from you; it CHEERS ME UP to see your handwriting.

not only to Bommel but also to London. * I wish the 
Prussians in Schleswig-Holstein the full enjoyment of this 'seasonable 
weather'. 5n If their patriotism or rather* their 'loyal and royal 
enthusiasm"1 *is not cooled down by that, then, Sir, we must give 
it up! * 
Our little childb *was quite enchanted by the really beautiful 
Dolly, Madame Augustc had chosen for her. I enclose some lines 
on the part of the child. She did not leave off bothering myself till 
I had promised her to enclose also for you a letter which she 
pretends to be written in Chinese characters and which an English 
friend has sent her.* 
[In Amsterd]amd I found the whole family well and cheerful. 
[Augustc] was very busy and so I said [nothing] at all to him about 
financial matters. At the insurance office I was given thousand 
guilder notes, most of which I changed in Rotterdam, with 
Jacques'' help, into bills and ABOUT a quarter into BANKNOTES. 
Nor, during the two days I was in Rotterdam, did Jacques have 
overmuch spare time. One day, he was pleading in a small town 
nearby and, the other, he had to attend a court of appraisal. On 
the whole, I should say that, since becoming engaged, he has had 
much more of AN EYE TO BUSINESS' than previously. I don't doubt 
that in a few years' time he will have a sound practice, the 
more so since he likes legal work. He himself told me that he wins 
nearly all his doubtful cases, and, if he goes to the trouble of 
telling one something like that, he can be taken at his word. He 
and I laughed a great deal about a man whom he describes as 'the 
client' par  excellence.  This man, he told me, was still young and, 
over the next 30 years  OR MORE,  might litigate away a lot more of his 
assets! 
Incidentally, August also has a quite peculiar faith in the 
infallibility of the courts. He opines, for example, that the English 
lose nothing by the high cost of their legal procedure. People who 
didn't engage in litigation had just as much chance of obtaining 
justice as those who did. * In point of fact, it seemed his opinion 
that dear law is as good as cheap law, and perhaps better; and he 
is a fellow who knows something about such things.* 
August gave me the 3 parts of the Aardrijkskunde? and, on top 
of that, Jacques provided me with a work on political economy 
(Dutch) by Vissering,h a professor at Leyden, and a copy of 
II Marx uses the Berlin dialectal form Untertanenbejeisterung instead of Untertanen-

Camera obscura? So I'm well stocked up with Dutch literature. 
Nothing in Frisian was to be had in Amsterdam, although in one 
bookshop alone there were works in 88 modern languages. The 
Negro languages seemed to have greater appeal to the Amster­
damers than Frisian,  * but man always contrives to neglect the 
things that are nearest to him *. 
Sorje Oppenheim^ which was already creating a great sensation in 
Amsterdam, has been performed here by my daughters to piano 
accompaniment  * and they hope to perform it one day before 
their uncle*. 
A great bundle of newspapers, etc., from various latitudes has 
accumulated for me here, *but I am firmly resolved to know 
nothing of politics until Monday next. 
Now, my dear uncle, I bid you farewell. Despite carbuncles and 
furuncles, I consider the two months I have lived in your house,

London,  25 February  1864 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Just a few  lines  for the  present  to let you  know  of my  return.561 
As soon  as the  weather permits,  I shall come  up to  Manchester  for 
2 days  so as to see you in  person again  and, at the  same time, give 
you an account  of my  AFFAIRS. 
I have completely recovered  and  only  one or two  spots (specially 
on the  upper part  of my leg),  which  are in the  final stages  of 
healing  up,  continue  to trouble  me  A LITTLE..  I haven't grown thin, 
but stout, despite  my  illness. True,  I have given  up  smoking 
completely. 
Pieper's sudden appearance  on our  doorstep  was a  real surprise. 
He's here  to settle  in his  sister  as a  GOVERNESS.  He spent  4 yrs as a 
schoolmaster  in Bremen. Last year  'he ate the  bread  of the 
National Association','24  and  even went  to Italy  at Augustenburg'sa 
expense.  He's the  same bore  and  lout  as he  always  was. 
With kind regards  to you and  Lupus. 
Your

Dear Uncle, 
I presume all of you are already or still in Aachen, and am 
therefore sending this letter there. Had you decided to wait for 
the fine weather, you'd have had to stay at Bommel until now. 
Here, at any rate, March has been  QUITE  ABOMINABLE,  apart from one 
or two fine days—cold, wet, and changing from one moment to 
the next. This may be one reason why I haven't so far rid myself 
of those confounded brutes, my furuncles. I curse them, but 
under my breath. 
LITTLE Eleanor has had a rather bad cough for the past two days 
which is what is preventing her from writing to you. However, she 
asks me to send you many salutations and, *in regard to the 
Danish Question, begs me to tell you, that 'she don't care for such 
stuff,  and that 'she considers one of the parties to the quarrel as 
bad as the other, and perhaps worse'*. 
The difficulty about understanding Prussia's policy is due solely 
to people's delusion in crediting it with serious and far-sighted 
aims and projects. The Mormon Bible,575  for instance, is similarly 
most difficult to understand, precisely because there isn't an iota 
of sense in it. What Prussia was primarily aiming at was to make 
the army popular, an aim which the Schleswig-Holstein campaigns

were already having  to  subserve  in 1848.57fi Secondly,  she was 
intent  on  closing  the  territory against German volunteer forces, 
democrats  and the  small states. Finally, Prussia  and  Austria,  by 
exerting  PRESSURE  FROM  WITHOUT,  were to enable the Danish king,a  who 
is hand  in glove with them,  to compel  the  Danes  to make certain 
concessions  at home  and  abroad. Austria could  not, of  course, 
leave Prussia  to play this role  on her  own,  and, at the  same time, 
seized  on the  opportunity  to  effect  a closer alliance with  her 
against  OTHER  PÉRIPÉTIES. 
The conference meets  in London  on 12th  April.577  The  very most 
it will  do is  resolve that Schleswig  and  Holstein  be bound  to 
Denmark  in a  personal union—maybe less, certainly  not  more.  How 
little  in  earnest  the  whole affair  is,  despite powder, shot  and 
blood-letting, will  be apparent  to you if  only from  the  fact that,  up 
till this moment, neither Prussia  nor  Austria  has  declared  war on 
Denmark,  nor  Denmark  on  Prussia  and  Austria. There  is no 
better  way of  throwing dust  in people's eyes than  to set  armies 
marching, horses stamping,  and  cannon thundering. 
DESPITE  ALL  THAT,  SERIOUS CONFLICTS  may BE  IMMINENT.  Once again, 
Bonaparte finds himself virtually compelled  to set his  troupiers  up 
in business  as 'freedom' exporters because  of the  great  DISAFFECTION 
which  is not  only prevalent  in Paris,  but  provokingly rearing  its 
head  in the  elections/™  And  this time,  the  way  has  been paved  for 
him by  those dogs  .of Prussians. 
Garibaldi's trip  to England  and the  great ovations  he will receive 
FROM  ALL  SIDES  here"9  are, OR at least are meant to be, merely the 
prelude  TO  A NEW RISING  AGAINST  AUSTRIA  As an ally of the Prussians in 
Holstein  and  Schleswig  and an  ally of the  Russians  by virtue  of the 
state  of siege  in Galicia, 580 Austria  has  made things very easy  for 
her enemies. What with  the  present conditions  in  Poland, 
Hungary,  and  Italy,  the  popular sentiment  in Germany,  and the 
total change  in England's position,  a new  Holy Alliance5 " would 
enable even Napoleon  le Petit h to  play  the  great  one. At  this, 
moment,  the  best thing would  be for  peace  to continue,  for any 
kind of war  would delay  the  outbreak  of revolution  in France. 
May God damn  ME IF  THERE  BE ANYTHING MORE STUPID THAN  THIS  POLITICAL 
CHESSBOARD! 
There were  two  other things  I had  actually meant  to write  to

Dear Uncle, 
I hope that the cough has gone the way of all flesh. As for 
myself,  there hasn't been a sign of a FURUNCLE for a few days, and 
my doctor1 thinks that I am now rid of the things for good. And 
high time, too. The sun seems to be breaking through at last. But 
there's still a nasty wind blowing from the East. Eleanor's cough 
has gone. However, her sister Jenny has a very persistent COUCH, 
[which]d  will disappear [only] with a change of wind. 
Conradi had already written to me before I got your letter, and 
I had replied, saying he could send the money here direct.c 
At the Museum' I have been taking a look at Boethius's De 
arithmetica (he wrote at the time of the Völkerwanderung) on 
Roman division (he didn't, of course, know any other  sort).  From 
this and a number of other works with which I have compared it, 
I see that moderately simple calculations, such as household and 
commercial accounts, were never done with [figures] but with 
pebbles and similar tokens on an abacus. On this abacus several

parallel lines were drawn and whatever was used, whether pebbles 
or other visual signs, denoted units on the first line, tens on the 
second, hundreds on the third, thousands on the fourth, etc. Such 
abacuses were in use throughout almost the whole of the Middle 
Ages and are still employed by the Chinese today. As for more 
complex mathematical calculations, at the time when these are 
found among the Romans, the latter already had the multiplica­
tion table—Pythagoras's—which, however, was still very awkward 
and cumbersome, for that table consisted partly of its own 
characters, partly of letters of the [Gre]ek (later Roman) alphabet. 
But [since] division merely boils down to the analysis of the 
dividend into factors and the tables in question were taken to 
fairly high figures, this must have sufficed for the reduction of 
expressions such as MDXL, etc. Every number, e.g. M, was 
separately reduced to the factors which it formed with the divisor, 
after which the quotients were added together. Thus, for example, 
M divided [by] two=D (500), D divided by  2 = 250  e[tc].  That the 
ancient method placed insuperable difficulties in the way of very 
complex calculations is evident from the artifices to which that 
outstanding mathematician Archimedes had recourse. 
As regards the 'darkness of outer space', this necessarily follows 
from the theory of light. Since colours only appear when 
light-waves are reflected by solids and since, in the intervals 
between the heavenly bodies, there is neither atmosphere nor any 
other kind of solid, these intervals must be pitch black. They allow 
the whole light-ray to pass through, which is simply another way 
of saying that they are dark. Moreover, space outside the 
atmosphere of the planets, etc., is fated to be damnably 'koud en 
kilm since the rays generate warmth only when they strike a solid, 
which is also why, summer or winter, it is icy cold in the higher air 
strata of our atmosphere—that is, owing to the thinness, hence 
the relative insubstantiality, of these layers. Bur 
Ought this affliction to afflict us 
Since it but adds to our delight?h 
And what good are light and warmth WHERK THERE IS  NO EYE  TO SEE 
THE ONE, AND NO ORGANIC MATTER TO KEEL THE OTHER? Long agO the Worthy

DEAR FREDERICK, 
The furunculosis persisted until  ABOUT  a week ago, which made  me 
very 'peevish'  and it  was not  until  a day or two since that  I was able  to 
start work again. 
This month, April  the  first's privilege  of being  ALL FOOLS DAY,  has 
been extended,  at least  in London,  to the  whole  of April. Garibaldi 
and Palmerston  FOR  EVER  on the  WALLS  of London!582 Garibaldi with 
Pam and Clanricarde, and extolled by the  ENGLISH POLICEMEN,  at the

Blind', the Athenaeum announces,  'HAS  JOINED  THE  SHAKESPEARE  COMMIT­
TEE!'585  The  fellow doesn't understand  one  line  of S. I had to put 
up considerable resistance  and  have doubtless completely forfeited 
WeberV esteem.  For the  Workers' Society3 (incited  by W.)  wanted 
m« to compose  an  address  to Gar., and  then call  on him  with  a 
deputation. I  REFUSED  FLATLY. 
When  are you  going  to come here?  The  family  is expecting  you. 
Tomorrow sees  the  start  of the  conference577 that will cause  the 
scales  to fall from  the  Teutons' eyes. Collet  has  announced himself 
for Thursdayb  and, at the  same time, sent  me a  whole LOT  of 
German literature  on the  Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenburg mess. 
Tomorrow  I shall have  to get  down  to a  serious study  of this 
disagreeable affair  so as to be  ready with  my  answers  for the 
fellow,  who has the  entire genealogy'86  at his  fingertips.  You may 
have noticed that  the  wretched Disraeli  has  spared  Pam the 
trouble  of  answering Osborne's  and  Kinglake's motions  on 
Schleswig-Holstein  at the  impending conference. Yesterday, Dis­
raeli gave notice that  he  would  put the  PREVIOUS QUESTION.  In all the 
SERIOUS  AFFAIRS  of the past 2 or 3 years (e.g. the Afghanistan 
business 297) he has  extricated OLD  Pam  from  the  MUDDLE. 
You will  see how  pitiful  (I mean what  a DONKEY)  Garibaldi is—he 
has been half  KILLED,  incidentally,  by John Bull's  EMBRACE—from  the 
following, which  is not,  OF COURSE,  common knowledge. 
At the  secret revolutionaries' congress  in Brussels (September 
1863)—which  had  Garibaldi  as its  nominal  CHIEF—it  was  decided 
that G.  should  go to  London,  but do so  incognito  and  thus catch 
the metropolis unawares.  He was  then  to COME OUT  for  Poland  IN THE 
STRONGEST POSSIBLE WAY.  Instead  of that,  the  fellow goes  and  frater­
nises with  Pam! I'd  rather  be a  louse  in sheep's clothing than  a 
man of such brave stupidity,  as Shakespeare says  in Troilus  and 
Cressida.c

Dear Moor, 
You will, presumably, at long last have rid yourself of the 
furunculosis. Meanwhile, Lupus has been suffering most vilely 
from the rheumatic headaches he was already having when you 
were here,573  and from which he has since had no respite—on the 
contrary, they have got worse and worse so that he's had no 
proper sleep for weeks. He's already been confined to bed again 
on several occasions, and that sod Borchardt does nothing at all 
about it; he treats the touch of gout Lupus has got in his toe (but 
which doesn't bother him at all now, whereas the headaches and 
insomnia are really sapping his strength) with Colchicum and 
doesn't even give him an occasional dose of opium. Once or twice 
I have spoken to Lupus pretty seriously about the matter, but you 
know how much good that does. He believes himself to be under 
an obligation to B., and that's that. All the QUACK has done is to cup 
him of ten ounces of blood! That was the day before yesterday. 
This evening I shall visit Lupus again and see how things are 
going. Three weeks ago I too had a violent and most painful 
attack of fheumatism of the respiratory muscles, but Gumpert 
cured me of it within 24 hours. 
The Garibaldi tomfoolery3 came to a fitting end. The way the 
chap was shown the door after a week of being gaped at by the 
SWELLS is really too splendid and could happen nowhere but in 
England. It would be the ruin of anyone except Garibaldi, and 
even for him it's tremendously mortifying to have served the 
English aristocracy as a NINE DAYS' WONDER and then to have been 
thrown out into the street. They treated him as an out-and-out 
romantic. How could the fellow submit to it and how he could be 
so stupid as to take these Dundrearys for the English people? 
However, anyone who is not now convinced of the wholly 
bourgeois nature of this gentleman will never be convinced. For to 
respect the English press is almost worse than respecting the 
PEELERS.588 And as for his EXIT! Well, that beats everything.

But our friend Bismarck is also a lumen." Of him it might even 
be said: n'est pas Soulouque qui veuù First he mimics Bonaparte's 
Press Laws, and now he's sending worthy Corporal William to 
Schleswig to induce the people to vote for annexation by 
Prussia! 589 This jackass seems to imagine that the highways and 
byways are strewn with Savoys and Nices and that these are to be 
had for the taking.590  As the Dagbladet quite rightly points out, by 
the way, the Prussian reactionary press has been in such a state,of 
exaltation since the capture of Düppel, 591 and the chaps are so 
above themselves that one can count with certainty on the gang's 
coming a really bad cropper within a very short space of time. 
I was a bit surprised by the way the Prussian army carried out 
the assault. The attack took place with 4 brigades (24 battalions) 
against 4 Danish brigades (16 battalions), i.e. by no means 
disproportionate superiority for an assault of this kind. Admitted­
ly, the Danes had been greatly worn down by artillery fire but so, 
for that matter, had the Russians at Sevastopol, and to un even 
greater extent. 592 However, the fact that in 20 minutes the 
Prussians took the first 6 field-works and then, in 2 hours—N.B. 
without orders, for the worthy princec wanted to call it a day—the 
whole peninsula/ including the bridgehead, and inflicted losses of 
5,000  on approximately 13,000 Danes, is more than one might 
have credited the fellows with. You will, by the way, remember 
that I have always said Prussian fire-arms—rifles as well as 
guns—were the best in the world, and that has been borne out 
here.  On the other hand, the conference377 will soon reveal what 
marionettes their diplomats are. What with Russia, Boustrapa,167 
and Palmerston, aided and abetted by the 'grand' policy of 
Bismarck, the 'fall' that follows after pride can hardly be long in 
coming. But how about money? After all, the 22 millions from the 
public treasury and the railway loan of 6 millions must have been 
squandered by now, and what then? 
I shall descend on you one of these Friday evenings but not, of 
course, without writing to you first. 
Write soon, and give my regards to the FAMILY.

Dear Moor, 
I have just been to see Lupus, who also had Gumpert and 
Borchardt with him. They don't agree over the diagnosis, which 
doesn't matter a rap for the time being, since it's a question of 
restoring his strength first, and here G. at once intervened more 
energetically. Yesterday I asked B. about port but he thought that, 
as L. wasn't quite lucid, he would be better without it and, only 
this morning, suggested—Spanish fly! Today Lupus is to get a 
beerglassful of champagne every 2 hours and this evening will, in 
addition, be given brandy in the  BEEF  TEA he takes in between times. 
That scoundrel Borchardt who only last Wednesday let ten ounces 
of his blood!! 3 For the rest, the situation is very bad, because 
whichever diagnosis may be right, one is as bad as the other. B.'s 
diagnosis is meningitis, inflammation of the inner scalp with a 
tendency to suppurate. G. hadn't yet been able to make one this 
morning, but thought that, in addition to the above, there might 
be uraemia (passage of urine into the blood as a result of 
degeneration of the kidneys) or anaemia with a localised affection 
of the nervous system. He had another call to make after the 
consultation, and so I was unable to talk to him at any length; as 
soon as I have heard his opinion I shall write to you. 
I should like you to come up tomorrow for a few days.593 I 
foresee that I shall be very busy this week, and it's always a good 
thing, of course, if one of us sees the doctors a couple of times a 
day and promptly obtains whatever has to be obtained. Besides, it 
would be very nice for me anyway. If you are coming, send me a 
telegram from your station of departure to 7 Southgate, St. Mary's; 
it only costs a shilling. 
In order to force his hand over the consultation, I was 
compelled to tell B. yesterday that you had just as much 
confidence in G. as I had and that, if Lupus were to die, you 
would never forgive me had I failed to call G. in for a

Dear Moor, 
The outlook for Lupus grows daily worse. His state of delirium 
is getting more and more chronic. He still recognises the people 
who come to see him quite well, but in between times he talks in a 
completely RAMBLING fashion and it is only after taking a strong 
dose of stimulants that he has his more lucid moments. However, 
these moments are becoming dimmer and briefer all the time. 
Gumpert has very little hope now; his diagnosis is softening of the 
brain as a result of the prolonged headaches brought on by 
cerebral hyperaemia and of the insomnia thus induced. There's no 
longer any question of Borchardt's meningitis; he has accepted 
G.'s diagnosis and generally does everything G. suggests, though 
he seems to have very hazy ideas about the origin of the 
headaches. 
Each day Lupus spends in this stupor, from which stimulants 
are incapable of rousing him, naturally makes matters worse and, 
if the next 3-4 days bring no improvement, the poor devil will go 
under either from debility or apoplexy or, if he pulls through, 
he'll be an idiot. This alternative—death or imbecility—is really 
too frightful. Gumpert, of course, is extremely guarded when 
talking about his colleague but I'm sure of the fact that L. could 
have been saved if the headache had been properly treated and if, 
in particular, something had been done to enable L. to sleep. But it 
was not until last Thursday, after five weeks of insomnia, that B.

gave him some opium. On top of that the blood-letting on 
Wednesday. He has persisted in treating him for gout, prescribing 
nothing but Colchicum and the like. It was only the onset of 
delirium that evidently caused him to have second thoughts. 
There is another consultation at 9 tomorrow morning which I 
shall also attend to see what he does. B. intends to get a male nurse 
for him today. If only the poor fellow pulls through!

Monday evening 8.30 
Dear Marx, 
Lupus is going rapidly downhill. He's having hallucinations, 
keeps jumping out of bed, etc. What we're short of now is a man 
to sit up with him and stop him injuring  himself.  There is only 
one professional male nurse up here, and he is engaged. 
Admittedly, Borchardt could get hold of one from a nearby 
lunatic asylum, but so long as there is the slightest chance of 
recovery he doesn't, of course, want that kind of person, being 
anxious to avoid subsequent gossip and the harm it would do L. 
He now wonders whether you might perhaps have a reliable man, 
who doesn't need to be a nurse by profession, far better not, but is

[Manchester,] 9 May 1864 
Dear Jenny, 
POOR Lupus died today, at 10 minutes past 5 in the afternoon. I 
have just left his death-bed. 
I went to see him on the evening of the day I arrived from 
London," but he was unconscious. The next morning he recog­
nised me. I saw him in company with Engels and the two doctors b 
and, when we were leaving, he called after us (in a weak voice): 
'You will come back, won't you?' It was a moment of lucidity. Soon 
afterwards he relapsed into a state of apathy. Up till Thursday— 
or really Friday' — evening, things hung in the balance so that 
there was some doubt about the outcome. But he was unconscious 
from Friday evening until the moment of his passing away. So 
long did it take for him to die, though he was not in pain. He was 
unquestionably the victim of that bombastic bungler/ I shall write 
at greater length tomorrow. 
In him we have lost one of our few friends and fellow fighters. 
He was a man in the best sense of the word. His funeral will be on 
Friday.'

Dear Jenny, 
POOR  Lupus, as it now transpires—and as Borchardt already 
knew—had accumulated a nest-egg by dint of hard and unremit­
ting work. 
In his will (of December 1863) he appointed Engels, Borchardt 
and myself his executors, and the notary has just read us his will. 
In it he leaves: 
1. £100 to the Manchester Schiller Institute429 
2. £100 to Engels 
3. £100 to Borchardt and 
4. The entire residue, amounting to six or seven hundred 
pounds, to me (to you and the children should I predecease him; 
he took care of all eventualities), likewise his books and all other 
effects. 
I must now go to his lodgings and sort out his papers. Luckily 
he was living—during the final 6 or 7 weeks, at any rate—with 
exceptionally good and worthy people and enjoyed the best 
possible nursing. The inane telegrams about nursing attendants3— 
of which Gumpert knew nothing—were sheer ostentation and 
consequentiality on the part of Bombastus B. 
A thousand kisses to you and the children.

[Manchester,] Friday, 13 May 1864 
Dear Heart, 
Today was the day of our good comrade's funeral. a We 
purposely didn't send out any invitations, otherwise half the town 
would have been there. So, it was attended by Borchardt, 
Gumpert, Engels, Dronke, Steinthal, Marotzki (the Friends of 
Light 594 Protestant pastor at whose house Lupus used to teach and 
who came as a personal friend), Beneke (one of the leading 
business men here), Schwabe (ditto), 3 other business men, a few 
boys and some 15-20 members of the  'LOWER  CLASSES'  amongst whom 
Lupus was very popular. I naturally made a short funeral oration. 
It was an office by which I was much affected so that once or 
twice my voice failed me. Freiligrath wrote, begging to be excused, 
because of the presence in London of his principal, Fazy. Engels, 
and more especially Dronke, refused to countenance this excuse, 
and tomorrow D. will be taking him to task in London. 
I shall have to stay here for at least another 3 or 4 days in order 
to get through with the whole business, pay the estate duty, swear 
oaths,  etc. Naturally I shall not leave Manchester until everything 
is settled. 
At first, it was thought that poor Lupus was suffering from 
incipient softening of the brain. This was wrong, however. 
Gumpert had previously said that he was suffering from cerebral 
hyperaemia (excessive accumulation of blood in the brain). This was 
confirmed at the post mortem, which also proved that he would still 
be alive today had he received correct treatment of the most 
common or garden kind. Borch. had completely and utterly 
neglected the thing in the most unscrupulous way. And yet one can't 
raise a shindy about it, if only because of B.'s family, who were 
deeply attached to Lupus (especially B.'s eldest daughter) and did 
a great deal for him, and whom he for his part thought highly of. 
All the same I refused B.'s invitation to dinner today (at which 
Engels, etc., were to be present) on the grounds that I could not 
accept hospitality on the day of Wolff's funeral.

Dronke asks you to excuse him for not having replied to your 
letter. The poor little man was too much distressed by the death of 
his children to be able to write. 
Lupus had carefully kept all our children's letters, and it was 
only a few weeks ago that he again told Mrs Borchardt how much 
he enjoyed getting little Tussy's notes. 
The day before yesterday Marotzki (while confirming the 
children, amongst them one of the younger Borchardts) pro­
nounced a public eulogy on Lupus in his church. I don't believe 
anyone in Manchester can have been so universally beloved as our 
poor little friend (who as a child broke both legs and was in pain 
for years until they had healed again). Amongst the letters he left, 
I found evidence of the warmest sympathy on the part of all kinds 
of people—pupils, both girls and boys, and, in particular, their 
mothers. 
My warmest greetings to all.

MARX TO HIS DAUGHTER, JENNY 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] Tuesday, 17 May 1864 
Sweet child, Badman, 
Probably I shall leave Manchester on Thursday (May 19) this 
week, and probably Engels will come with me. 595 If arrangements be 
changed, I'll advertise you timely. 
I visited Ernest Jones yesterday and renewed my old friendship 
with him. He received me very cordially.  Eichhoff,  who is here at 
this moment, and sends to all of you his compliments, wrote me 
this morning that the son-in-law of Dr. Rohde—Marriett—has 
suddenly died; the daughter" being thus thrown back upon 
Thekla Marriet 

=====第563页=====
318. Marx to His Daughter, Jenny. 17 May 1864 527 
Liverpool and the parents. Eichhoff has at last settled down as a 
commercial employé. 
Little Dronke, who to-day arrived from London, told funny 
stories as to the meeting he had a few days since with Freiligrath. 
Fazy, Freiligrath's master, was present at the rendezvous at 
2 Royal Exchange Buildings. 
Strohn, an old friend of mine—who, unhappily, finds himself in 
a very bad state of health, and whom I was hardly able to 
recognise—came down from Bradford to see me; Eichhoff having 
told him of my sojourn at Manchester. 
Gumpert has been blessed with a son. 
I address these lines to you, because you will probably have to 
make room for Engels, your room being, I believe, the only 
disposable one. You don't want to care about wine which we bring 
with us, but a dozen bottles of Pale Ale for our Manchester man 
will be welcome. J cannot finish my business here, 596 because this week 
is a holiday for lawyers here. So things will not be settled before 
next week, and in my absence. 
I have seen, from Möhmchen's" letter, with great concern, that 
Marie Lormier is not going on in the right direction. These 
doctors are a lot of quacks. 
Any letter you'll address me, will still find me at Manchester, if 
you post it tomorrow before 5 o'clock p.m. 
I hope, my dear child, to find you in full bloom. My humble 
compliments to your successor, and my knowing wink to mine 
secretary. 
Your truly 
Old one 
I should very much like to buy here Manchester silk for the 
whole family, but the delay that, consequent upon the holiday, has 
taken place in the settlement of affairs, prevents me from 
indulging my fancy. 
G. J. Harney, as you may tell Möhmchen, has again married, 
and, moreover, left Europe for Australia. 598

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS 
IN BARMEN 
Manchester, 24 May 1864 
Dear Hermann, 
You must excuse my keeping you waiting some little while for a 
reply to your letter of the 7th and that of the 18th. 
As regards the £"1,000, I shan't be able to remit this to you 
before 1 July, or perhaps a little later. That is to say I must await 
the statement of accounts on 30 June of this year, since G. Ermen 
will release himself from the contract if so much as a penny is 
missing from the £10,000 I have to put up. Until then, therefore, 
I must tread carefully. I also mentioned this to Mother in my 
letter of 7 April,599  and hence the best thing would be for you to 
pay Wiebelhaus & Busch from over there. In any case, for a sum 
of the order of £1,000, I wouldn't be able to lay my hands on bills 
as short as a week after date. More about this matter, then, in July 
or August; I am in no hurry whatever. 
It had struck me, by the way, that this £"1,000 could be partially 
reimbursed by my prevailing on G. E. to send off to you in 
advance the interest amounting to £375 due on 30 June; but, since 
our bankers are now paying us 6% interest, he'll take good care 
not to give you the money at 5%. 
As regards my balance with you over there, this should be dealt 
with as follows: 
On 30 June, the £10,000 which, under the terms of the 
contract, must remain here, will be debited to me over there. 
Deduct from that the portion of my balance there on which the 
interest accrues to me; as to the remainder I must refund you the 
interest à 5%. The portion of my balance of which Mother has the 
usufruct would best continue to be credited to me separately, since 
it doesn't figure in my favour when interest is calculated and 
would therefore only muddle up the calculation. 
The one question that may have to be considered in this 
connection is the exchange rate at which £s are to be converted 
into talers. In my view, the simplest thing in all present and future 
cases relating to my account would be to take the average rate of 
6 talers 20 silver groschen, as Father also used to do in his books, so 
that the £10,000 will be debited to me as 66,666.20 talers, while all 

=====第565页=====
320. Marx to Engels. 26 May 1864 529 
reimbursements made by me in £s will be credited at the same 
rate.  Think it over and let me know what you think about it. 
As regards the transfer of the £10,000 to my account, you have 
no need to advise G. E. further; the contract, to which you are all 
subject, is sufficient. 
Very many thanks for the pictures. They've touched up your 
face a bit more than is necessary; apart from that, they're very 
good. But you must now see to it that the other ones for my 
album follow on soon, and also remind the good Boellings about 
it, for so far I have none of them at all. In the case of the Blanks, 
I don't have one of Maria Senior, Emil Junior,  Rudolf,  and the 
younger ones. 
Apropos. Should Ermen &: Engels over there be asked to pay 
the costs of an insertion, to which I was a co-signatory, in the 
deaths' column of the Kölner," Breslauer b and Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung, I would ask you to attend to it and debit me 
accordingly. 600 
Give my love to Mother, if she is still in Barmen, and tell her 
that I've been keeping very well. Much love to Emma' (she's still 
not as plump as she used to be, but I trust that will resolve itself) 
and the little ones as well as to Rudolf and family, the Blanks, 
and the Boellings.

as to what  I should  do? I  don't want  to take iron since  I already 
have  a tendency  to cerebral congestion.  Nor do I  wish  to go to 
Allen, there being nothing  I dread  so  much  as  having  to 
recommence  a regular course  of treatment, thus disrupting  my 
present work,  and I  simply must  get the  thing done  at long last.547 
Despite  all  that people said about  how  well  I looked,  I have  all the 
while felt there  was  SOMETHING WRONG  and the  tremendous resolution 
I have  to summon  up  before  I can  tackle more difficult subjects 
also contributes  to  this sense  of  inadequacy.  You  EXCUSE THIS 
SPINOZISTIC  TERM.  Have  OUR  POOR  Lupus's books been sent off to 
London? h01  I am  worried about their non-arrival because—or  so I 
understood—your  WAREHOUSEMEN  were supposed  to have sent them 
off on  Thursday (last). 
WHAT  DO YOU  SAY OF GRANTS OPERATIONS?™2  All that The Times chooses 
to admire,  OF COURSE,  is Lee's strategy disguised  as  RETREATS.3  Says 
Tussy this morning,  'IT  CONSIDERS  THIS  VERY CANNY,  I DARESAY.'  There's 
nothing  I would  be  happier  to see  than success  for  Butler.  It 
would  be of  inestimable value, were  he to  enter Richmond first.  It 
would be bad if Grant had to retreat,  BUT  I THINK THAT  FELLOW  KNOWS 
WHAT  HE IS  ABOUT.  It is to him, at any rate, that credit is due for the 
first Kentucky campaign, Vicksburg  and the  drubbing Bragg 
received  in Tennessee.

Dear Moor, 
The books haven't gone off yet, nor has the wine. They will go 
off together. Have heard nothing from either Borchardt or the 
lawyer; shall call on the latter the day after tomorrow and give 
him the power of attorney.604 
Gumpert says that, if the furuncles are merely stragglers, you 
should do nothing further about them. I discussed little Jenny 
with him; he says it would seem to be a chlorotic condition and 
that sudden attacks of asthma are common in such cases, and are 
due to circulatory disorders; nothing could be done save treat the 
condition as a whole, nor could he think of anything beyond what 
Allen is already doing. Anyhow, he didn't seem to take too serious 
a view of the thing. 
The Virginian campaign is once again characterised by inconclu-
siveness, or more precisely, by the difficulty of taking it to any sort 
of decision on terrain like this.602  I set no store by the news 
received per Scotia; all it means is that a week's rain has saved Lee 
from the necessity of fighting battle after battle à la Solferino. M5 
And for him, that means a great deal. Another 2 such battles and 
his army, which had to withdraw to a new position every night and 
was in any case in a very sorry state, would hardly have been 
capable of making a stand anywhere before Richmond. Certainly 
Grant also benefited from the standstill, but not to the same 
extent. The reinforcements he is now obtaining won't be worth 
very much. But I shouldn't be surprised if Lee were soon to 
withdraw to Richmond. Then the decisive battle will take place 
there. 
Bismarck seems to have colossal good luck; it really looks as 
though there's going to be an Augustenburgian peace.606  As yet I 
can make neither head nor tail of it, but my view would seem to 
be confirmed by the very hectoring article in today's Morning Post? 
(It says, inter alia, that Schleswig should be partitioned and—the 
Eider form the new frontier between Danish and German

Schleswigl) Nevertheless, plausible though it all seems, I can hardly 
see the Russians giving up, without more ado, all the spoils of 
1851/52, 607 the less so since they would not, so far as one can see, 
get anything in return. 
I have been engrossed in the arithmetic in your Francoeur? a 
section you would seem pretty well to have ignored, if the failure 
to correct the scandalous printing errors in the figures is anything 
to go by. Though individual bits are quite elegant, the practical 
aspect of arithmetic is handled in a shockingly inept and 
superficial manner, being better taught at any German school. I 
also doubt whether it is practical to discuss things such as roots, 
powers, series, logarithms, etc., even at elementary level, merely in 
terms of numerals (without any recourse to algebra and,  IN FACT, 
without presupposing an elementary knowledge of the same). 
Although the use of numerical examples by way of illustration 
may be a good idea, I should say that to limit oneself to numerals 
is, in this case, less conducive to clarity than simple algebraic 
treatment with a+b, precisely because the general expression is 
simpler and clearer in algebraic form and is something which 
cannot be dispensed with here. Admittedly, this particular section 
is really beneath the dignity of the mathematician par excellence. 
I shall send you Danskeb papers tomorrow. In several Jutland 
towns Prussian officers are said to have objected very strongly 
before carrying out the confiscation in accordance with orders. 
Generally speaking, there have been no complaints anywhere 
about the troops, only about the generals and their orders. In the 
Dagbladet England is, if anything, more roundly abused than in 
Germany. 
No other news, save that it's bitterly cold. Warm regards to your 
wife and the girls. I HOPE TUSSY IS CONTENT WITH THE COTTON.

Dear Frederick, 
Herewith 
1. A scrap of paper sent me today in a wrapper from Brussels 
by jackass Kertbeny; 
2. Cutting from the Rheinische Zeitung containing an obituary of 
Lupus—written by Eisner, now one of the editors of the Breslauer 
Zeitung, from which the Rheinische has reprinted it a; 
3. Another cutting from the Rhein. Zeit., in which I would draw 
your attention to the article 'Der feudale Sozialismus' 13; 
4. Letter from one Klings of Solingen to one Moll over here. To 
enable you to understand this letter, I should explain that Moll 
(and also a companion of his c) is a working man from Solingen, 
who (along with the aforesaid companion) has evaded a 4 months' 
prison sentence (the result of Lassalle's performances last year). 
Klings, ditto a working man, is Baron Izzy's authorised representa­
tive in Solingen. 
The two Solingen refugees came to see me here; they informed 
me of their enthusiasm for Izzy and how the workers had 
harnessed themselves to his carriage when he was last in Solingen. 
They assumed as a matter of course that we two were hand-in-
glove with Izzy (who, when last in Elberfeld, made a speech about 
Lupus 608). Klings, they said, was a former member of the League,63 
as were all the working men who were leaders of Izzy's movement 
in the Rhine Province, and that, now as ever, all were our resolute 
supporters. He also showed me Klings' letter, and I asked whether 
I might have it to send to you.609 To this he assented. So, don't 
return it. I did not, of course, enlighten the chaps as to our 
relations, or rather non-relations, with Izzy, but got others to drop 
some pretty vague hints. 
Now the men are hanging about here, unemployed. 50 talers 
are to be sent them from Solingen, the local Workers' Society 3 is

would  be a  good thing  if Manchester could contribute  a pound  or 
two. The  fellows must  be  conveyed  to  America, since they  are 
factory hands (Solingen cutlers,  etc.) and are  quite unsuitable  for 
London handicrafts. 
'What's come over  me?' I  asked myself more than once while 
reading Izzy's Lohnarbeit  und  Kapital?  For in its  essentials  it 
seemed  to me  familiar, literally  so (if  embellished  in the  Izzian 
manner),  yet not  cribbed direct from  the  Manifesto!'  etc.  Then,  a 
couple  of days  ago, I  happened  to look  out my  series  of articles  on 
'Wage-labour  and  Capital'  in the  Neue Rheinische Zeitung (1849) 
which were  in fact merely  a printed version  of lectures  I had 
delivered  in 1847 at the  Brussels Workers' Society. 131 There  I 
found  my  Izzy's immediate source  and, as a  special  act of 
friendship,  I shall reproduce  the  whole caboodle from  the 
N. Rh. Z. as a note or appendix to my  book—ON  FALSE PRETENCES,  of 
course,  and  without  any  mention  of Izzy. B1° He  won't enjoy  it in the 
least. 
The books have arrived,601 ditto  the  wine,  for  which many 
thanks.  Tussy asks me  'TO  GIVE YOU  HER  LOVE AND  TO TELL YOU THAI YOUR 
COTTON  HAS SOMEWHAT  IMPROVED'. 
Borkheim  has  made  ABOUT  £2,000—under  the  patronage  of 
Oppenheim,  the 'Jew  Süss' c of  Egypt. Oppenheim,  to whom, 
according  to the  account  B.  himself gave  me, he  played more  or 
less the  part  of jester  in the  land  of the  pyramids, wanted  to keep 
him there  on the  spot.  But  Europeans  die  there like flies,  so B. 
arranged instead  to be  entrusted from time  to time with  a little  bit 
of business  by  Abul Haim,  as Oppenheim  is called  by the  Arabs. 
This summer  he  will again visit Constantinople  to that  end.

The latter tells me that to safeguard oneself against any possibility 
of future claims one should, about 1 month after PROBATE (i.e., as 
from 1 July), insert 3 successive notices in.the Gazette," Times and 
LOCAL PAPERS, addressed to undeclared creditors and limiting the 
period of liability. This means the final settlement will be 
somewhat further delayed. The demand for payment of duty will 
be made in September or thereabouts (so until then interest on the 
amount in question will be recoverable), after which we shall have 
to deal with Wood's account and pay over the money; it will then 
be possible to dispose of the matter finally.

children say that it makes you look a 'pleasant subject'.3 As the 
new photograms we intended to have taken have not yet 
materialised, little Jenny yesterday sent you the glass thing. The 
Dagbladet received with THANKS. 
The enclosed letter from Liebknecht which I got yesterday will 
interest you in several respects. You should place it in the archives, 
like the other letters of this kind I send you. I immediately replied 
to L., generally commending him for his attitude and only 
reprimanding him for the silly stipulation—our collaboration—he 
made in regard to the proposed publication of Lassalle's  PAPER— 
now happily abandoned. 614 I explained that, while we consider it 
politic to give Lassalle a completely free rein for the time being, 
we cannot identify ourselves with him in any way.... In the course 
of this week I shall send him (Liebknecht) some money. The poor 
devil seems to be doing damned badly. He has given a very good 
account of himself and his continued sojourn in Berlin is most 
important to us. 
Borkheim showed me a letter from the great Orges, presently in 
Vienna. O. intimates that 'softening of the brain' has 'got the 
better' of the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung, that 'particularism' 
rather than 'Teutonism' holds sway over the paper, that one of the 
four proprietors of the Augsburg A. Z. had 'insulted' him (the 
'great Orges') 'almost personally', that his hands had long been 
tied and he had finally resigned, etc. SERVES O. RIGHT. The fellow 
treated us vilely over the Vogt affair. b 
Borkheim has given me very exact particulars in writing, 
authenticated on the spot, concerning progress on the Suez Canal. 
I shall see that Daud Pasha c is advised of the same. 
As for the Danish affair, the Russians are in a very difficult 
position. They drove Prussia into the war by promising her the 
earth and, as a quid pro quo for Prussia's help, past and present, 
over the Polish business,607  held out great prospects in regard to 
Schleswig-Holstein. Needless to say, handsome William, d now that 
he looks upon himself as WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, cannot be fobbed 
off in the same way as his brilliant predecessor.615 As for 
Palmerston, his hands are tied by the Queen.e Bonaparte, whom 
the Russians and their Pam wanted to use as a scapegoat to 
propitiate the Germans, HAS REASONS OF HIS OWN for playing the 
deaf-mute. Come to that, aside from a possible secret treaty with 
Prussia, the Russians are now chiefly concerned with 'German

sympathies'. It is therefore possible that, under SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, 
they will 'sacrifice' Schleswig-Holstein, just as, in the 3rd partition 
of Poland, Catherine II declared the cession of the present 
kingdom of Poland to the Prussians to be a great sacrifice on her 
part—with the mental reservation, of course, that, when the time 
came, the sacrifice would be retrieved. 5" The outrageous step the 
Russians have now taken in the Caucasus,616  watched by the rest of 
Europe with idiotic indifference, virtually compels them—and 
indeed makes it easier for them — to turn a blind eye to what is 
happening elsewhere. These 2 affairs, the suppression of the 
Polish insurrection and the annexation of the Caucasus, I regard 
as the two most important events to have taken place in Europe 
since 1815. Pam and Bonaparte can now say that they have not 
ruled in vain, and, if the Schleswig-Holstein war 572 has served no 
other purpose than to hoodwink Germany and France about those 
two great events, it will have done its job for the Russians, 
whatever the outcome of the London Conference. 577 You will see 
from Liebknecht's letter that the Prussian liberal press is too 
cowardly even so much as to remark on the continued surrender 
of Polish refugees by the Prussians. Bismarck has killed it stone 
dead with the Schleswig-Holstein business. 
The AMERICAN NEWS looks very good to me; I was particularly 
delighted by today's LEADER in The Times, in which it is proved that 
Grant has been continually beaten and may perhaps be punished 
for his defeats—with the capture of Richmond! 
Salut.

Manchester, 9 June 1864 
Dear Moor, 
Your telegram received; the other halves of the five banknotes 
follow herewith. I have cleaned up the glass photogram" a bit and 
now find that it's very good. I shall show it to Gumpert and his 
wife this evening. 
Clearly it's of the utmost importance to us that Liebknecht 
should be in Berlin—to spring surprises on Izzy and also, at an 
appropriate moment, quietly to enlighten the workers at large 
about our attitude towards him. At all events, we must keep him 
there" and support him to some extent. If you send him some 
money now, it will encourage him a great deal and, if you think 
any more is needed, let me know and I'll send you a five pound 
note for him. 
Apropos obituary for Lupus. We must do a kind of biography; I 
think we ought to have it printed in Germany as a pamphlet, with 
the whole of the parliamentary debate1' as an appendix. Let's not 
allow the thing to slide.617 
What do Borkheim's reports say about progress on the Suez 
Canal? Have matters actually got to a stage that points to its early 
completion? 
I'm very anxious to see how things go in Virginia. The sides still 
seem to be almost evenly matched and mere chance, the 
opportunity of scoring an isolated victory over just one of Grant's 
corps,  might restore Lee's superiority. The battle before Richmond 
may be fought under quite different circumstances, for Butler is 
certainly weaker than Beauregard, otherwise he wouldn't have let 
himself be forced on to the defensive and, even if one were as 
strong as the other, Lee, if he linked up with Beaur. at Richmond, 
would certainly be stronger than Grant and Butler combined. For 
Lee can debouch with his entire force from his fortified camp on 
each side of the James River, whereas Grant must detach part of

his troops (to the south side of the river). But I am hoping that 
Grant will, nevertheless, go through with the affair; at all events, 
there can be no doubt that, after the first battle in the Wilderness, 
Lee has shown little further inclination to engage in decisive 
encounters in the open field,618 on the contrary, he has always 
kept his main force in fortified positions and only committed 
himself to brief attacks. I also like the methodical pace of Grant's 
operations. On such terrain and with such an opponent it's the 
only correct method. 
A collection for the Solingen chaps 3 won't produce anything up 
here;  however, it goes without saying that I shall send you 
something for them. Let me know, when you've reached that 
stage, how much they have got for the journey and how much it 
will cost. 
Three days ago our old Hill finally handed in his cash box, but

Herewith a letter I have received from Liebknecht who also sent 
a piece from the Grenzboten about Lupus. d Liebknecht will by now 
have got my second letter containing a 'real consideration' (as 
Mr Patkul calls it in his secret despatches e). 
The Russians would seem to be claiming Schleswig-Holstein 
for themselves under the heading of Oldenburg, 619 and to 
be 'compensating' Prussia for it. This TRANSACTION WOULD BE TOO 
CLEVER. 
A Dutch orientalist, Professor Dozy of Leyden, has brought out 
a book' to prove that 'Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are figments; 
that the Israelites were idolaters; that they carried round a "stone" 
in the "  arke  des Verbunds" g; that the tribe of Simeon (driven out 
under Saul) went to Mecca where they built a heathen temple and 
worshipped stones; that, after the release from Babylon, Ezra 
invented the myth of the creation up to and including Joshua, and 
also wrote laws and dogmas, thus paving the way for reform, 
monotheism, etc.'. 
That's what they write and tell me from Holland; they also say 
that the book has created a great sensation among theologians 
there, particularly since Dozy is the most learned orientalist in 
Holland and, what's more—a professor at Leyden! Outside 
Germany at any rate (Renan, Colenso, Dozy, etc.) there is a 
remarkable anti-religious movement.

Dear Uncle, 
Very many thanks for your detailed letter. I know how onerous 
writing is for you on account of your eyes and, indeed, the last 
thing I expect is that you should answer every one of my letters. I 
was glad to see from what you wrote that you are physically fit, 
and that your equanimity has not been shaken by the revelations 
of Prof.  Dozy.a However, since Darwin demonstrated that we are 
all descended from the apes, there is scarcely  ANY SHOCK WHATEVER 
that could shake 'our ancestral pride'. That the Pentateuchb was 
concocted only after the return of the Jews from Babylonian 
captivity had already been pointed out by Spinoza in his Tractatus 
theologico-politicus.

hope  to be. The  child  had  already placed  'her  letter'  on my  desk 
some  3 or 4  days  ago. 
I have  had a  recurrence  of FURUNCLES and only got  rid of  them  a 
fortnight ago. Since my work was greatly impeded by this tiresome 
complaint—and,  in  addition,  the  doctor's orders precluded 
strenuous  or prolonged mental work—I have, which will surprise 
you not a  little, been speculating—partly  in American  FUNDS,  but 
more especially  in English stocks, which  are  springing  up  like 
mushrooms this year  (in  furtherance  of  every imaginable  and 
unimaginable joint stock enterprise),  are  forced  up to a  quite 
unreasonable level  and  then,  for the  most part, collapse.  In this 
way, I have made over £400 and, now that  the  complexity  of the 
political situation affords greater scope,  I shall begin  all  over 
again.  It's a  type  of operation that makes small demands  on one's 
time,  and it's worth while running some risk  in order  to relieve the 
enemy  of his  money. 
All is well,  on the whole, with my family. The doctor wishes little 
Jenny  to have  a CHANGE OF AIR  and,  unless  you or  fate have  any 
objection,  I and my 3  daughters will descend upon  you  towards 
the end of the  summer. 
By now the fruitless outcome  of the conference577  will have been 
made known  ALL  OVER  EUROPE  by telegraph. The only people  in this 
diplomatic tragi-comedy  who are  imperturbably pursuing their 
former aims  and  playing  a masterly game  are  les russes?  On the 
one hand, they  are  reviving  the  Holy Alliance, 511 chivvying  the 
German oxen into  war, and  thus diverting  the  eyes  of Europe 
from their own colossal successes  in Poland  and  Circassia;  on the 
other, they  are  inciting Denmark  to resist  and  will, thanks  to Mr 
Palmerston, eventually succeed  in getting England  to declare  war 
in support  of the  Protocol  of  1852M0 which,  as documentary 
evidence  has now  shown,  was  dictated  by Russia620 ! The  English, 
who did not go to war for  Poland although pledged  to do so by 
the treaties  of 1815 and who did not go to war for  Circassia 
despite  the  fact that possession  of the  Caucasus assures Russian 
hegemony in Asia, are to go to war and — I  THINK IT  PROBABLE—will 
go to war,  for a  treaty dictated  by Russia, while that same Russia 
officially sides with  the  opponents  of  that very treaty!  C'est 
incroyable  !b There's  not a  vestige  of sympathy  for  Denmark 
amongst  the  English people (although, needless  to say, antipathy 
and to spare  for  Prussia and Austria);  it proved impossible  to hold 
ONE SINGLE  PUBLIC  MEETING  in support  of the Danes; the fund started  by

a few  aristocrats  for the  Danish wounded  PROVED A COMPLETE FAILURE; 
but the  English people have  no  more  say in  their foreign policy 
than  the man in the  moon.  The  PUBLIC OPINION  advanced  in The 
Times,  etc., is  'prescribed'  by the  wishes  of OLD  Pam  himself. 
Between  19 and 21  June Copenhagen  was on the  brink  of 
revolution.  The  kinga  had  received  a Russian despatch advising 
him to  declare himself  in  favour  of a  personal union  of the 
Duchies with THE  DANISH CROWN.  The  king,  a creature  of the 
Russians  (who  placed  his  sonb  in  Athens,  his  daughterc  in 
England,  and  himself  on the  Danish throne), came  out in  favour 
of the  Russian proposal, which  was  opposed  by his  minister, 
Monrad. Only after  a two-day debate, Monrad's resignation  and 
demonstrations  IN THE STREETS OF  COPENHAGEN,  did the  brand-new  KING 
draw in his horns,  BUT IN THIS WAY RUSSIA HAS AGAIN SHOWN THE CLOVEN FOOT. 
Quite apart,  by the by,  from  its  being  in Russia's specific interest 
that the war  should continue  and  spread,  it is in her  general 
interest that  the  peoples  of Europe,  of whom  she is the  common 
foe, should bloody each other's heads.  The  AIRS  Prussia gives 
herself—handsome William  as WILLIAM THE  CONQUEROR—are  comical. 
This pomp  and  circumstance will come  to a  sudden  and  sticky 
end. 
To give  you  an idea  of what  the  GOOD  Palmerston  is like,  I enclose 
with The  Morning Post (Palmerston's private monitor)  a cutting  of 
a speech made  by  Ferrand during  a parliamentary debate/  It is 
concerned solely with  the  appointment  of a  CHARITY  INSPECTOR.  From 
the passages  I have marked,  you  will see  the  sort  of things that  are 
said to Pam's face  in Parliament  but  without ever penetrating  his 
hippopotamus's hide. 
I deliberately avoided seeing Garibaldi  DURING HIS STAY AT  London."

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 5 July 1864 
Dear Moor, 
When I wrote to you on 3 June, saying I would settle the 
business of the money on the 4th ,a  this can only have related to 
the money in the bank, about which I did actually make 
arrangements straight away. It didn't occur to me that you would 
want any more money for the present, and we had in fact agreed 
that you would write and say if you did wish to have any more; 
hence I simply left it on deposit with that philistine Steinthal, who 
does,  after all, pay 5%. 
But to SETTLE the matter of the legacy from the 3rd to the 4th of 
June would have been promising more than I or anyone else 
could do. I believe I also wrote and told you that this might be a 
fairly lengthy business, depending as it did on all sorts of legal 
formalities (ADVERTISING a request to Lupus's undeclared creditors, 
payment of estate duty, etc.) which can't be hurried along. 
However, I'll leave no stone unturned to wind up the affair 
quickly. 
But this is not, of course, to say you won't get an approximate 
share of the bequest as soon as you want it. You'll be getting a 
minimum of £600—I hope more—so we'll be able to send you 
another £350 or so, and I shall see to it that you actually get it this 
week. I shall also badger Borchardt to send in his bill, for this is 
partly why much still remains to be settled. 
If only you'd dropped me a couple of lines before now, I should 
have been able to procure the £350 for you at any time, i.e. within 
a See this volume, p. 535.

the office all day, arguing with lawyers and G. Ermen (the  DEED  OF 
PARTNERSHIP isn't ready yet, and until then G. E. refuses to recognise 
my right to act as a partner 270), on top of which I've had Dronke 
here.  Now it's nearly 7 o'clock, and I've still had no DINNER, nor 
have I yet finished work. So you see how things are.

[London,] 12 July 1864 
1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park 
Dear Freiligrath, 
I got a letter today (just now) on which the address would 
appear to be written in your hand. If that is so, I should like to 
know how the letter reached you? It is from that blackguard Brass 
(in Berlin) who has the impudence to ask me to forward a scrawl 
to Biscamp.622 Having lost sight of that vagabond Biscamp years 
ago, I have, moreover, no idea how to rid myself of the scrawl, 
since the creature's WHEREABOUTS are not known to me. 
I am writing from my bed, having had to take to it for several 
days because of what was a very dangerous carbuncle. This 
damned complaint keeps incessantly cropping up again. 
On the 15th inst. I shall send Lenchen to you bearing £30, 
returned with many  thanks—if,  that is, I am not myself capable, 
though I think I shall be, of betaking myself between now and the 
15th (inclusive) to the City, where I have other business to attend 
to. 
Salut.

IN MANCHESTER 
Ramsgate, 25 July 1864 
46 Hardres Street 
Dear Frederick, 
You will see from the address that I am spending a few days in 
Ramsgate. 
It was a far from agreeable surprise to discover that my FURUNCLE 
was in fact an extremely malignant CARBUNCLE and, what is more, 
has had the impudence to erupt just above my penis. So, for ABOUT 
10 days, I've been obliged to spend most of my time in bed—and 
in this heat, too! The thing is clearing up pretty quickly here; 
however, my confidence has completely evaporated now that the 
disease has unexpectedly cropped up again in such a malignant 
form. 
Jenny and Tussy are here with me; Laura is coming the day 
after tomorrow and in ABOUT 8 or 10 days we shall go to Holland, 
during which time my wife will betake herself to the seaside. 
Apropos. Don't forget to send the latter her chain, as she will need 
this for her watch when at the resort. She says all you have to do 
is put it in a little box and have it posted, so sending it off couldn't 
possibly put you to much trouble. 
I hope you have now sorted things out with Ermen and are no 
longer being BOTHERED by LAWYERS.3 
As for the Schleswig-Holstein affair, I'm not yet wholly 
convinced that it won't end in a personal union between the 
Duchies and Denmark. The jealousy between Prussia and Austria 
and that felt by both towards the German Confederation, as well 
as the quarrel between Augustenburg b and Russia's pretender, 
Oldenburg,' etc., mean that such a solution is still at least a 
possibility, even at this late hour. Incidentally, as far back as 1851, 
Palmerston put forward the Duke of Oldenburg d en passant and as 
a pis aller" as candidate for Schleswig-Holstein. 
I shall write and tell Laura to send you The Free Press.

Dear Uncle, 
I found your letter waiting for me here when I came back from 
the British Museum yesterday evening. It was already too late for 
me to reply straight away. I need not tell you how alarmed I and 
all the family were by the contents of your letter.623 One thing we 
failed to understand. Why didn't you leave the house instantly 
with Nettchena? I would advise you to do so even now. When the 
same thing happened in my family, I immediately sent the 
children away; and the giantessb can be nursed perfectly well 
without you. Why court danger unnecessarily? You will forgive me 
for interfering, but I feel too worried about you  TO MINCE MATTERS.  In 
fact, I am sorry that I am not with you in person, for this disease 
has no effect upon me, as I know from experience and, had you 
really insisted on not leaving the house  (BUT  WHY  NOT?), I could have 
stood by you at this time of crisis, for in such crises two are better 
able than one, and three better able than two, TO  KILL  TIME  AND  ROUGH 
IT. 
I have written to Nettchen about our own recent doings,42 and 
she will pass on to you what little is worth mentioning. On the

whole, things  are  going quite well here  and all  members  of the 
family  are  reasonably  fit. 
Just now  there's  a political  and  social lull here. Everyone  who 
can, makes  off,  either abroad  or to  seaside resorts  in this country. 
The monotony  is broken only  by  daily reports  of terrible  RAILWAY 
ACCIDENTS.  Capital over here isn't  as  much subject  to  police 
supervision  as on the  Continent,  and  hence  it's of no  concern 
whatever to the  RAILWAY DIRECTORS  HOW  MANY PEOPLE  ARE  KILLED DURING  AN 
EXCURSION  SEASON,  IF ONLY  THE  BALANCE LOOKS  TO  THE  COMFORTABLE  SIDE.  All 
attempts  to make these  RAILWAY  kings responsible  for  their  HOMICIDAL 
NEGLECT  OF ALL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES  have hitherto come to grief as a 
result of the great influence exerted by the  RAILWAY  INTEREST  in the 
HOUSE  OF COMMONS. 
Another source  of distraction over here  is the  ANXIETY PREVAILING IN 
MERCANTILE CIRCLES BECAUSE  OF THE  RISE  OF THE  RATE  OF DISCOUNT!  It is  Certain 
that,  if the  present  RATE OF DISCOUNT  remains  at its  present high  for a 
few more weeks, there will  be a  great  CRASH  among  the  myriads  of 
SWINDLING  JOINT  STOCK  COMPANIES,  which have been springing up like 
mushrooms this year. Already, here  and  there  in the  CITY  a major 
bankruptcy heralds  the  approaching storm. 
I recently  had an  opportunity  of  looking  at a  very important 
scientific work, Grove's Correlation  of  Physical Forces.  He  demon­
strates that mechanical motive force, heat, light, electricity, 
magnetism and  CHEMICAL AFFINITY  are all in effect simply modifica­
tions  of the  same force,  and  mutually generate, replace, merge 
into each other,  etc.  With great skill  he  dismisses such odious 
metaphysical-physical phantasms  as  'latent heat'  (as  good  as 
'invisible light'), electric 'fluid'  and  similar verbal  pis aller* which 
come  in handy  as understudies  in place  of ideas. 
I hope  to have good tidings  of you  soon.  So  much  am I  taken 
up with thoughts  of you  that  I am  unable  to  compose myself 
sufficiently to read the important  AMERICAN NEWS  today. 
The whole family send their warmest regards. Kindly remember 
me to Jettchen,  the doctor, Fritz b et cie.

DEAR  Frederick, 
I returned from Ramsgate 3 exactly three weeks ago today. The 
trip to Holland has fallen through, because a maid in my uncle's 15 
household suddenly contracted smallpox. 
Last week my wife had a severe attack of cholerine which did, 
for a spell, look like becoming dangerous. Yesterday she left for 
Brighton (solo). 
I have sundry letters from Liebknecht here which, however, I 
shall not send as I don't know whether you are in Manchester. 
The enclosed scrawl by Collet c will amuse you, and, should you 
not be there, it doesn't really matter. What naïveté on C.'s part! 
Since (to use an Austrian construction) I had done a long article 
on the RUSSIAN CLAIMS for him, which he didn't print, he expects me 
to take an interest in his ridiculous rubbish. 
The enclosed letter from Eisner is in reply to my wife's asking 
him for biographical notes on Lupus.d 
I've been operative again for a couple of days. Before that I was 
still troubled with sickness and INCAPABLE. If you haven't left yet, let 
us know at once. We hope to see you on your way through at any 
rate.  The children send you their love. Jenny can hardly wait to 
show you her GREENHOUSE. 
I haven't yet quite made up my mind about the Schleswig-
Holstein affair, and more facts will be needed before a clear 
picture can be gained of it. You were right when you predicted 
the rebirth of the Holy Alliance. e Bonaparte would seem to have a 
strong 'inclination  AT  LEAST'  to make 'a fourth in the alliance'.1 Since 
the outbreak of the Polish revolution to date, the utter despicability 
of the fellow has Manifested itself in the clearest and most genuine 
light.624

Dear Moor, 
I had assumed from your last letterb that you'd be in the depths 
of the Dutch fens, hence my pertinacious silence. I couldn't find 
your address in Holland. I sent your wife the watch and chain on 
6 August, in a box, by registered mail, and trust it arrived safely. 
I intend to travel from Hull to Hamburg next Thursday, the 
8th, or Saturday, the 10th September, in order to take a look at 
OUR NEW PROPERTY in Schleswig and Holstein and shall, provided there 
are no passport difficulties, also go from Lübeck to Copenhagen. I 
shall not be returning before the end of September and, if at all 
feasible, shall spend a day in London on the way back. 
The PARTNERSHIP business has at last been settled, and the 
contracts signed,1 so I hope to have 5 years' peace from that 
direction. 
We have left our house in Tennant Street626 and have been

have bettered ourselves after much the same fashion as you did by 
your last removal. The address is 86 Mornington Street, Stockport 
Road, Manchester. Letters to be addressed to me by name as 
before. 
Jones's address is 52 Cross Street, Manchester. 
The Danes still believe, or rather fear, that a personal union will 
be established and, since editors Bille, of the Dagbladet, and Ploug, 
of the Faedrelandet, are both deputies and undoubtedly have good 
sources, and, since the present ministers are also good Russians, I 
feel convinced that powerful intrigues towards that end are being 
conducted by Russia. However, Monsieur Bismarck certainly has 
other things in view and, if he is to gain positive advantages, i.e. if 
he is to mediatise Schleswig-Holstein, 027 I think he will need the 
Augustenburg chap 3 pretty badly. This much is certain, never has 
Prussian dynastic policy involving the partition of Germany along 
the Main been so insolently advocated, and as for the rotten liberal 
gang, they seem to be taking quite kindly to it. Should this be the 
case—and I shall find out easily enough in Germany—the 
Prussian bourgeoisie will be giving us a tremendous lever for the 
next SET-TO. I am sure by the way that Eisner is right, at least about 
the old provinces628 being intolerably flushed with victory. Indeed, 
I shall take care not to go there. It will be bad enough even on the 
Rhine. 
To the worthy Gottfried's1' intense alarm, I told him about 
Monsieur Bonaparte's ardent desire to join the Holy Alliance0  on 
the very day the matter became known. The fellow's bound to 
come to a bad end. To ruminate perpetually about 'business' is 
very aging, as I can see from Gottfried, who has much the same 
attitude to trade as B. has to politics, and whose train of thought is 
also similar. As the years go by, one dreams of retirement and, if 
it's not feasible, one's health suffers. N'est pas Palmerston qui veut. 6'29 
Ce cher1 ' Bonaparte is, I should say, very much ON THE DECLINE. SO 
much the better; once he starts to flag, he'll soon be done for. 
Best wishes to the girls. But why didn't you drop me a couple of 
lines to say you were not going to Holland and that your wife was 
ill? Your

Dear Jenny, 
Yesterday I got a letter from Freiligrath—copy below—from 
which you will see that Lassalle has been gravely wounded in a 
duel in Geneva. We were genuinely dismayed by the news since, 
whatever one may say, L. is too good to go under in this way. 
After receiving the letter, I went to see Freiligrath, i.e. at his 
private address, knowing that Ida" was away. He seemed very 
'agreeably' surprised by my visit. His daughter Louise was with 
him. The rest of the crew are coming back at the end of this week. 
Louise had been staying in Brighton for a fortnight with Franziska 
Rüge. Bearing in mind the Freilig.-Ruge, etc., connection, you 
should take care with your baroness's cards. b Ruge would be just 
the fellow to turn something like that to account. 
Freilig. was by no means as 'moved' as he made out in his letter, 
but cracked his little jokes as always, even on the subject of L. He 
told me that his bank was in a state of crisis and that the Geneva 
affair in particular and the role played therein by Fazy were doing 
it a great deal of harm.630 Finally, here is Tussy's LAST. It being plain 
from F.'s letter that L. had fought a duel on account of a ladyc he 
wished to marry, Laura recalled how he told every woman he 
could 'only love her for 6 weeks'. So, says Tussy, 'HE  IS WARRANTED  FOR 
6 WEEKS'.

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 4 September 1864 
86 Mornington Street, 
Stockport Road 
Dear Moor, 
Your telegram631  arrived yesterday even before I had opened 
your letter, my attention having first been claimed by all kinds of 
business. You can imagine how surprised I was by the news. 
Whatever Lassalle may have been in other respects as a person, 
writer, scholar—he was, as a politician, undoubtedly one of the 
most significant men in Germany. For us he was a very uncertain 
friend now and would, in future, most certainly have been our 
enemy; but nevertheless, it's very galling to see how Germany 
destroys all those in the extreme party who are in any way worth 
their salt. What jubilation there will be amongst the manufacturers 
and amongst the Progress swine, for L. was indeed the only man 
actually inside Germany of whom they were afraid. 
But what an extraordinary way to lose one's life: To go and fall 
seriously in love with a Bavarian envoy's daughter"—this WOULD-BE 
Don Juan—, ask for her hand, clash with an ex-rival,b not to say 
Wallachian swindler, and get himself shot dead by the same. Such 
a thing could only happen to L., with his strange and altogether 
unique mixture of frivolity and sentimentality, Jewishness and 
chivalresquerie. How could a political man like him exchange shots 
with a Wallachian adventurer? 
You can see with what speed the news travelled from the fact 
that his death had already been announced on Thursday evening 
in the Kölnische Zeitung, which arrived here at midday yester­
day 0— 2 hours after your telegram. 
What do you think of things in America? Lee is making masterly 
use of his fortified camp at Richmond, and small wonder, this 
being already the third campaign to revolve around it.632 He is 
pinning down Grant's massive force with comparatively few men 
and is employing the better part of his own troops for offensive 
action in West Virginia and as a threat to Washington and

Pennsylvania. A first-class object-lesson for the Prussians, who 
could learn from it down to the last detail how to conduct a 
campaign centred upon the fortified camp of Coblenz, but who 
are, of course, far too arrogant to learn anything from these 
improvised generals. Grant—discharged from the army for 
drunkenness 6 years ago when a lieutenant, subsequently a 
bibulous engineer in St. Louis—has much UNITY OF PURPOSE and 
considerable contempt for the lives of his cannon-fodder; he 
would also seem to be very resourceful as a small-scale strategist 
(i.e. day-to-day operations), but I look in vain for any signs that he 
has enough breadth of vision to be able to survey the campaign as 
a whole. It seems to me that the campaign against Richmond is on 
the point of collapse; the impatience with which G. is attacking 
now in one place now in another, but nowhere proceeding 
methodically with saps and mines is a bad sign. Altogether, so far 
as the Yankees are concerned, the engineering branch would seem 
to be in a poor state; for this calls, not only for theoretical 
knowledge, but also for a tradition of practice which cannot be 
readily improvised. 
Whether Sherman will cope with Atlanta seems doubtful, but his 
chances are, I think, rather better.633 Skirmishing by guerrillas and 
cavalry to his rear are unlikely to do him much harm. The fall of 
Atlanta would be a hard blow for the South, Rome would fall at 
the same time and that's where their gun foundries, etc., are; in 
addition, the railway connection between Atlanta and South 
Carolina would be lost. 
Farragut is the same as always. The fellow knows what he's 
about. But whether Mobile itself will fall is very doubtful. The 
town is very strongly fortified and can, so far as I know, only be 
taken from the landward side, since vessels of deep draught can't 
approach near enough. But how stupid to split up the attacking 
forces on the coast, where Charleston and Mobile are being 
attacked simultaneously instead of one after the other, but each 
time with all available forces. 
I don't set much store by the peace-talk that is now so prevalent. 
Not even by the negotiations allegedly conducted direct by 
Lincoln. All this I regard as an electioneering ploy. As things now 
stand, I should say that Lincoln's re-election is fairly certain.634

MARX TO ENGELS 369 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 7 September 1864 
DEAR FREDERICK, 
During the past few days my thoughts have been damnably 
preoccupied with Lassalle's misfortune. After all, whatever else he 
may have been, he was one of the vieille souche h and the foe of our 
foes.  And then the thing came so unexpectedly that it's hard to 
believe so noisy, STIRRING, PUSHING a person is now dead as a 
door-nail and compelled to hold his tongue ALTOGETHER. AS regards 
the cause of his death, you are perfectly right. c It is one of the 
many indiscretions he committed in the course of his life. WITH  ALL 
THAT, I am sorry that our relationship should have been clouded in 
recent years, though the fault lay with him. On the other hand, I 
am very glad that I resisted every incitement from whatever 
quarter and never attacked him during his 'year of triumph'.636 
Heaven knows, our ranks are being steadily depleted, and there 
are no reinforcements in sight. I'm convinced, by the by, that this 
catastrophe would never have happened had L. not consorted with

land. But he was fatalement drawn again and again to this Coblenz 
of European revolution. 637 
The 'Bavarian envoy's daughter'3  is none other than the 
daughter of Dönniges of Berlin, a fellow university demagogue 638 
of Rutenberg and co.'s, originally one of that little weed Ranke's 
jeunes h GENTS—or  rather, since they were no GENTLEMEN, jeunes 
gens c—whom he got to edit beastly old German imperial annals,d 
etc. What that capering little troll Ranke regarded as wit—playful 
anecdotalism and the attribution of all great events to mean and 
petty origins—was strictly forbidden these  YOUNG MEN FROM THE 
COUNTRY.  They were supposed to stick to what was 'objective' and 
leave wit to their master 1 Our friend Dönniges was regarded as 
something of a rebel, since he contested Ranke's monopoly of wit, 
in deed if not word, and showed ad oculos e in various ways that he, 
no less than Ranke, was a born 'valet' of 'history'. 639 
Well, I wonder what will become of the organisation built up by 
L.640  Herwegh, that platonic friend of 'labour' and practical friend 
of the 'Muses', isn't the right man. In general, none of its lesser 
leaders are anything but RUBBISH. According to what Liebknecht 
writes, the Schulze-Delitzsch Association in Berlin 641 can now boast 
no more than 40 MEMBERS. HOW things stand over there is clear 
from the fact that our Wilhelm Liebkn. is A CONSEQUENTIAL  POLITICAL 
PERSONAGE.  Should L.'s death lead fellows like Schulze, etc., to make 
insolent remarks about the deceased, we can only hope that L.'s 
official supporters conduct themselves in such a way as to enable 
us to enter the lists IF  NECESSARY.  I must now find out who has his 
correspondence. I shall at once obtain an  INJUNCTION—for  already 
the mob of memoir vultures such as Ludmilla,' etc., are circling 
round these literary remains—prohibiting the publication of a 
single line of mine or yours. If necessary, this can be legally 
enforced in Prussia. 
So far as America is concerned, I consider the present moment, 
entre nous, s to be extremely critical. If Grant suffers a major 
defeat, or Sherman wins a major victory, so  ALL RIGHT.  Just now, at 
election time, a chronic series of small CHECKS would be dangerous. 
I fully agree with you that, to date, Lincoln's re-election is pretty 
well assured, still 100 to l. h But election time in a country which is

the archetype  of democratic humbug  is full of hazards that  may 
quite unexpectedly defy  the  logic  of events  (an  expression which 
Magnus Urquhartus considers  no less idiotic than 'THE JUSTICE OF A 
LOCOMOTIVE').  An  armistice would seem  to be  quite essential  to the 
South,  if it is to be  saved from complete prostration.  It was the 
first to raise this  CRY,  not  only  in its  northern organs,  but  actually 
in those  of Richmond, although,  now  that the  said  cry has  evoked 
an echo  in New  York,  the Richmond Examiner  is scornfully tossing  it 
back to the  Yankees.312  It is  altogether symptomatic that  Mr  Davis 
should have decided  to treat Negro soldiers  as 'prisoners  of 
war'—the last official order  of his war  secretary.11 
Lincoln  has at his  disposal considerable means  for  achieving 
election. (Needless  to say, the  peace proposals made  by him are 
MERE HUMBUG.)  The  election  of an  opposition candidate would 
probably lead  to a  genuine revolution. Nevertheless, there  is no 
mistaking  the  fact that during  the  next  8 weeks,  in the  course  of 
which  the  matter will  be decided  pro  tern, much will depend  on 
military eventualities. This  is undoubtedly  the  most critical 
moment since  the  beginning  of the  war. Once this  has  been SHIFTED, 
OLD LINCOLN  CAN  BLUNDER  ON to his heart's content. The old man, by the 
by, cannot possibly 'create' generals.  He'd be  better able  to select 
ministers.  Yet the  CONFEDERATE  PAPERS  attack their ministers just  as the 
Yankees  do  those  in Washington. Should Lincoln succeed this 
time—as  is highly probable—it will be  on a far  more radical PLATFORM 
and in completely CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES. Then  the old man  will, 
lawyer-fashion, find that more radical methods  are  compatible with 
his conscience. 
I hope  to see you  tomorrow! Regards  to Madame Liz.b 
Herewith  a photograph  of Laura.  I am  hourly awaiting that  of 
Jenny,  but it has not,  alas, arrived  yet.  Salut  OLD BOY.

My Dear Countess, 
You will realise how surprised, dismayed and shocked I was by 
the utterly unexpected news of Lassalle's death. He was one of the 
people by whom I set great store. For me it is all the more 
distressing in that of late we had no longer been in touch. The 
reason for this was neither his silence alone—for it was he who was 
the instigator, not I — nor my own illness, which lasted over a year 
and of which I only rid myself a few days ago. There were also 
reasons which I could tell you by word of mouth but not in 
writing. Let me assure you that no one can feel greater sorrow 
over Lassalle's untimely end than I. And, above all else, I feel for 
you. I know how much the deceased meant to you and what his 
loss must mean. One thing you can be glad of. He died young, at 
a time of triumph, as an Achilles. 
I hope, my dear Countess, that your proud and courageous 
spirit will enable you to withstand this blow fate has dealt you, and 
that you will never doubt the wholly loyal devotion of 
Your sincere friend, 
Karl Marx

[London,] 16 March I860" 
My Dear Karl, 
A thousand thanks for the letter42  and the SPECIE. I have not got 
Rheinländer's address, since you took your address book away 
with you. But, so as to lose no time, I have, none the less, written 
to him and directed the letter to Mark Lane, care of Gänsewinkel. 
I could not think of anybody who might be able to tell me his 
address, which is not indicated in his letters. If you think the letter 
might fail to reach him by this means, you had better write to him 
yourself.  I shall at once betake my  HUMBLE  BEING  to Baccalaureus and 
make my report. We have indeed learned of late to distinguish 
true and loyal friends from shams. What a difference between the 
lesser folk and the GRANDEES. Lassalle, by the by, has grown fearfully 
stupid and narrow-minded; even that modicum of lawyer's 
acumen he had has gone to the devil, and Heraclitus has made 
him hellishly DULL and dark. b None of his raisonnements' is valid, 
each overturning the last. Nothing could have given me greater 
pleasure than the news about your book. Russia has always been 
good ground for you. 643 In the long run, everything is going 
better than I had sometimes dared to hope in my hours of 
solitude. One becomes so beset by doubts and fears and in the end 
one despairs of everything, particularly when one thinks of the 
universal duplicity, baseness and cowardice—the Germans' be­
haviour with regard to the Humboldt CASE644 alone is enough to

Dear Mr Engels, 
Moor has asked me to say that, if you possibly can, you should 
concoct an article3 for him by Fridayb or Saturday. Several 
have,  alas, already fallen by the way, and even today's still seems to 
me problematical.0 ANYTHING WILL DO. Maybe some chat about the 
attack on Venice—no matter what. 
This week I hope to start copying the pamphlet/ The thing is 
taking ages, and I'm afraid Karl is making too thorough a job of it. 
My pet bugbear is the 'analysis of Techow's letter'56 and that, I 
should say, is where the snag lies. Everything else is making better 
headway. 
Every day Schily and Becker send us piles of fresh documents, 
which are being incorporated into the thing. And I'm sorry to say 
that nothing has been done about finding a publisher yet. But the 
whole business is to be completed this week. 'And he who 
disbelieves it is mistaken.' 6 
Warm regards from the girls and  myself. 
Yours, 
Jenny Marx

JENNY MARX TO LOUISE WEYDEMEYER 
Hampstead, 11 March 1861 
My dear Mrs Weydemeyer, 
Your kind letter arrived this morning and, so you can see how 
delighted I was to get it, I am sitting down straight away to write 
to you at some length since, from your friendly lines, I conclude 
that you like to hear from us, and that your recollection of us is 
as cordial as is ours of you. Indeed, how could such old party 
comrades and friends, on whom fate has imposed much the same 
joys and sorrows, the same sunny and gloomy days, ever become 
strangers, even though time and oceans have separated us? And 
thus from afar I hold out my hand to you as to one who is a 
plucky and loyal fellow fighter and fellow sufferer. Yes, my dear 
Mrs Weydemeyer, our hearts have often been heavy and troubled 
and I can imagine only too well what you have latterly had to

endure, what struggles and worries and deprivations, having often 
been through the same thing  myself.  But suffering tempers us and 
love keeps us going. 
During our early years here, we did indeed suffer bitterly, 
though today I will not dwell upon the many dark memories, the 
many losses we had to endure, nor upon the dear, sweet loved 
ones who have gone to their rest and whose images we always bear 
silently and with profound sorrow in our hearts.3 Let me tell you 
today about a new period in our lives which, along with much that 
is sad, has, nevertheless, brought many a bright moment. In 
1856,  I and our three remaining girlsb  made a trip to Trier. My 
dear mother's delight on my arrival with her little grandchildren 
was indescribable but, alas, of short duration. The truest and best 
of mothers fell sick and, at the end of eleven days' suffering, her 
dear, weary eyes, having rested once more in benison on myself 
and the children, closed for ever. Your dear husband, who knew 
my affectionate mother, will best be able to gauge my sorrow. 
After our dearly loved one had been laid to rest, I left Trier, 
having arranged for the division between my brother Edgar and 
myself of what little my dear mother had bequeathed to us. Up till 
then, we had been living in 3 wretched furnished rooms in 
London. With the few hundred talers that my mother left, after all 
the sacrifices she had already made on our  behalf,  we settled into 
the small house we still occupy, not far from lovely Hampstead 
Heath 646 (a name that you, as the translator of The Woman in 
White,c will no doubt recall). It is indeed a princely dwelling 
compared with the holes we lived in before and, although it was 
furnished from top to bottom for little more than £40 (in which 
SECONDHAND RUBBISH played a leading role), I felt quite grand at first 
in our SNUG PARLOUR. All the linen and what little else remained of 
earlier finery were redeemed from 'Uncle's'0 and I again had 
the pleasure of counting the damask table napkins which are, 
besides, all of old Scottish descent. Although the glory did not last 
for long—for soon one thing after another had to make its way 
back to the 'POP-HOUSE' (as the children call the mysterious shop with 
its three golden balls)—we did, nevertheless, revel in our domestic 
comfortableness. Then came the first American crisis and halved 
our income.265 This meant a return to a more frugal way of life

and debts. These last were necessary if our daughters' education, 
but recently begun, was to continue along the same lines as before. 
And this brings me to the highlight of our existence—the 
brighter aspect of our lives—our dear children. I am convinced 
that, if your dear husband was fond of the girls even as small 
children, he would be truly delighted with them, now that they are 
well-grown, blooming young damsels. Even at the risk of your 
regarding me as a very complacent and indulgent mother, I 
cannot resist singing the dear girls' praises. They are both 
endowed with exceptionally warm hearts, are gifted and have 
becoming modesty and maidenly good manners. Little Jenny will 
be seventeen years old on the 1st of May. She is a girl of great 
charm and very attractive appearance, with her thick, shiny dark 
hair and equally dark, shining, gentle eyes and dark, Creole-like 
complexion, which has, however, acquired a genuine English 
bloom. Her childlike face, round as an apple, wears a sweet and 
good-natured expression and, when the smiling lips part to reveal 
her nice teeth, one forgets her not very beautiful little snub nose. 
Little Laura, who was fifteen years old last September, is perhaps 
prettier and has more regular features than her elder sister, whose 
very opposite she is. As tall, slender and finely built as little Jenny, 
she is in all other respects lighter, more radiant and transparent. 
The upper part of her face might be described as beautiful, so 
lovely is her curly, wavy chestnut hair, so sweet the dear, greenish 
sparkling eyes, which flicker like eternal feux de joie, so noble and 
finely shaped is her forehead; however, the lower part of her face 
is somewhat less regular, nor is it as yet fully developed. A truly 
blooming complexion distinguishes both sisters, and both are so 
little given to vanity that I sometimes cannot help feeling secretly 
surprised, the more so since the same could not be said of their 
mother in her earlier days, whilst still in pinafore dresses. At 
school they have always carried off the first prize. They are 
completely at home in English and know quite a lot of French. 
They can read Dante in the Italian and also know a bit of Spanish; 
only German is their weak point and, although I do everything in 
my power to impose an occasional German lesson upon them, they 
never really bow to my wishes and neither my authority nor their 
respect is very much in evidence. Little Jenny has a special talent 
for drawing and her pastels are the finest adornment of our 
rooms. Little Laura so neglected drawing that, to punish her, we 
stopped her taking lessons. On the other hand, she practises the 
piano with great zeal and sings German and English duets with 
her sister most delightfully. Unfortunately, it was only very

belatedly, some eighteen months ago, that the girls were able to 
begin their musical education. To obtain the money for it 
was quite beyond us, nor did we possess a piano; indeed, the one 
we have got now and which I have hired is a veritable rattle trap. 
The girls make us very happy with their sweet, modest behaviour. 
But their little sister is the idol and spoilt darling of the entire 
household. 
The baby had only just been born when my poor, dear Edgar 
departed this life, and all the love we felt for the dear little boy, all 
our tenderness towards him, was transferred to his little sister, 
whom our elder daughters tended and nursed with almost 
maternal solicitude. Indeed, a more delightful child can hardly be 
imagined — pretty as a picture, guileless and with a whimsical sense 
of humour. A particular characteristic is her charming way of 
talking and story-telling. The latter has been learned from the 
Grimm Brothers, who are her companions by day and by night. 
We all of us read her the fairy tales until we can read no more, 
but woe betide us if so much as a syllable is left out in 
Rumpelstiltskin or in King Thrushbeard, or in Snow-White. The 
child, who has already absorbed English with the air she breathes, 
has also learnt German from these fairy tales and speaks it 
exceptionally grammatically and precisely. She is a real  PFT of Karl's 
and dispels many a care with her laughter and chatter. In the 
domestic sphere 'Lenchen' still remains my staunch, conscientious 
companion. Ask your dear husband about her, and he will tell you 
what a treasure she has been to me. For sixteen years now she has 
weathered storm and tempest with us. 
Last year we suffered intense provocation in the shape of an 
infamous attack by the 'well-rounded character' and the vile 
behaviour of the entire German, American, etc., press. You would 
not believe how many sleepless nights and worries the whole 
business has caused  us. fi47 The case against the Nationalzeitung cost 
a great deal of money and, when Karl had finished his book, a he 
was unable to find a publisher. He had to have it printed at his 
own expense (£25) and, now that it has come out, it is being 
hushed up by the base, cowardly, venal press. I am exceedingly 
glad that you liked the book. Your opinion of it agrees almost 
word for word with that of all our friends. Needless to say, the 
silence quite deliberately maintained by the press has meant far 
fewer sales than we might rightfully have expected. In the 
meantime, we shall have to be content with the great encomiums 
•l Herr Vogt

of everyone who matters. Even opponents and enemies have 
acknowledged it as highly important. Bücher called it a compen­
dium of contemporary history, and Lassalle writes to say that, as a 
work of art, it has given him and his friends indescribable 
pleasure, its fund of wit having occasioned them endless glee and 
delight. Engels considers it to be Karl's best book, a as does Lupus. 
Congratulations are flooding in from all sides, and even that old 
cur Ruge has called it a 'good piece of nonsense'. I wonder 
whether a similar silence is being maintained in America. It really 
would be too infuriating, the more so since all the newspapers 
there have opened their columns to stupid lies and calumnies. 
Perhaps your dear husband can do something about making the 
book known. 
Hardly had I finished copying the manuscript,b  while it was still 
being printed, when I suddenly became very unwell. A most 
frightful fever took hold of me, and the doctor had to be called in. 
On 20 November he arrived, examined me carefully and at length 
and, after a long silence, came out with the following words: * My 
dear Mrs Marx, I am sorry to say, you have got the small­
pox— the children must leave the house immediately.* You can 
imagine the horror and distress of the household on hearing this 
pronouncement. What was to be done? Undismayed, the Lieb­
knechts offered to take the children in, and by midday the girls, 
laden with their small belongings, had already betaken themselves 
into exile. As for me, I became hourly more ill, the smallpox 
assuming horrifying proportions. My sufferings were great, very 
great. Severe, burning pains in the face, complete inability to 
sleep,  and mortal anxiety in regard to Karl, who was nursing me 
with the utmost tenderness, finally the loss of all my outer faculties 
while my inner faculty—consciousness—remained unclouded 
throughout. All the time, I lay by an open window so that the cold 
November air must blow upon me. And all the while hell's fire in 
the hearth and ice on my burning lips, between which a few drops 
of claret were poured now and then. I was barely able to swallow, 
my hearing grew ever fainter and, finally, my eyes closed up and I 
did not know whether I might not re.main shrouded in perpetual 
night! 
But my constitution, aided by the most tender and constant 
care,  got the better of it and now here I sit, once more in perfect 
health, but with a face disfigured by scars and a dark red

tinge—quite à la hauteur de la mode couleur de 'Magenta'? It was not 
till Christmas Eve that the poor children were allowed to return to 
the paternal fold for which they had been yearning. Our first 
reunion was indescribably touching. The girls were profoundly 
moved and could scarcely refrain from weeping over my 
appearance. Five weeks before, I didn't look too bad alongside my 
blooming daughter's. Since I was by some miracle still without a 
grey hair in my head and had still kept my teeth and figure, I was 
habitually considered to be well-preserved—but how changed was 
all this now! To myself I looked like a rhinoceros, a hip­
popotamus, which belonged in a zoological garden rather than in 
the ranks of the Caucasian race. But do not be unduly alarmed! 
Things are no longer quite so bad today, and the scars are 
beginning to heal. Scarcely had I been able to leave my bed than 
my dear, beloved Karl fell ill, laid low by excessive anxiety, worry 
and troubles of all kinds. For the first time, his chronic liver 
complaint became acute. However, God be praised, he recovered 
after four weeks' suffering. In the meantime, we had again been 
temporarily reduced to half pay by the Tribune h; instead of 
earning something from the book, a bill of exchange had to be 
paid. On top of that, there was the huge expense occasioned by 
this most frightful of all maladies. In short, you can imagine how 
things have been with us all this winter. As a result of all this 
business, Karl decided to make a foray into Holland, the land of 
his fathers, and of tobacco and cheese. He wants to see if he can 
wheedle some SPECIE out of his uncle. At the moment, therefore, I 
am a grass widow, waiting to see whether the great Dutch 
expedition will be successful. On Saturday, I got the first letter 
expressing some hopes and containing 'sixty gulden'. Such an 
affair is not, of course, quickly concluded and calls for careful 
manoeuvres, diplomacy, and proper management. Still, I hope 
that Karl will get something out of that country and leave it the 
poorer. 
As soon as he meets with some SUCCESS in Holland, he intends to 
make a little clandestine trip to Berlin278 in order to spy out the 
terrain and, perhaps, arrange for a monthly or weekly publication. 
Recent experience has shown us only too plainly that we cannot 
possibly manage without an organ of our own. Should Karl 
a Magenta, a deep purplish red reminiscent of the colour of blood, was fashionable 
in Paris in 1859. It owes its name to the North Italian town of Magenta, where the 
Kreuch forces defeated the Austrians in a bloody battle on 4 June 1859. - '' See this

succeed in setting up a new party organ, he will assuredly write to 
your husband, asking him to send reports from America. Hardly 
had Karl left when our faithful Lenchen also fell ill and is still laid 
up. However she is on the mend. My hands are completely full 
therefore, and this letter has been written in the greatest HURRY. But 
I neither could nor would remain silent, and it bas done me good 
to pour out my heart for once to our oldest and most loyal 
friends. So, I will not apologise for having written to you in such 
great detail and about anything and everything. My pen ran away 
with me, and I can only hope and wish that these scribbled lines 
may give you a little of the pleasure that I got when I read yours. 
I immediately attended to the matter of the bill of exchange and 
arranged everything just as though my lord and master were here. 
My girls send their love and kisses to your dear children—one 
Laura to the other—and in my thoughts I embrace each of them. 
To you  yourself,  my dear friend, I send my most affectionate 
greetings. In these hard times, you must be plucky and keep your

How often have I thought of the lovely potato soup you used to 
give me in Frankfurt. Unfortunately, it cannot be made here. 
There is no cream, and an egg beaten up in a drop of milk is not 
half as good. Which reminds me of Dronke, and so I shall have to 
start another sheet in order to give you some news of old friends. 
Engels is in Manchester, as before. His father is dead, he has 
inherited, but is engaged in a law-suit with his partner, is in the 
clutches of the lawyers and by no means out of the wood 
financially. 
Lupus makes a livelihood by giving lessons in Manchester. He is 
just the same as ever—a decent, hardworking chap of simple 
habits. He is held in very high regard up there, and his main 
battles are fought with his landlady who, he being a bachelor of 
long standing, now cuts down his tea, now depletes his sugar, now 
interferes with his coal supply. Dronke has had a real stroke of 
luck, having obtained a commission agency through Gamier-Pages 
which earns him nearly £1,000 a year. He has become an 
out-an-out philistine, boastful and repulsive; he has not behaved

nearly as well towards Karl or any of his oldest friends as might 
have been expected. He has a penchant for that fat philistine 
Freiligrath, who is still living comfortably off his post as MANAGER of 
a rotten bankrupt firm. He has changed considerably for the 
worse and has not treated us in a friendly manner!4  For political 
and diplomatic reasons an open breach with him is to be avoided. 
We maintain a factitious relationship. I have broken completely 
with the distaff side of the family. I am not fond of half MEASURES. 
So, I don't see anybody just now. Pieper has gone away and is 
living as a teacher in Bremen—he has come down badly in the 
world and become a slovenly flibbertigibbet. Yesterday, Dr 
Eichhoff arrived here from Berlin. He is the first refugee from 
the régime of 'handsome William' as the Berliners call their 
present sovereign. Imandt is a married man in Scotland.— Red 
Wolf a teacher in some God-forsaken spot—turned philistine— 
aussi* married, 3 children. And that is all I can remember in haste 
about our old acquaintances. 
Well, then, that's what I call gossip! But now, and for the last 
time,  farewell.

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, before 16 March 1861] 
My dear Mr Engels, 
How can I thank you for all the love and devotion with which 
you have stood by us for years now in our sorrows and afflictions? 
I was so happy when I saw there was five times as much as I had 
expected, that it would be hypocritical not to admit it, and yet my 
joy was as nothing compared with Lenchen's! How joyously her 
almost lifeless eyes lighted up when I ran upstairs and told her: 
'Engels has sent £5 for your COMFORTS.'

It seems to me that the inflammation has gone down a 
bit—yesterday the doctor also thought her somewhat better, 
though she is still dangerously ill. The only question is whether 
she may not get too weak and whether some kind of haemorrhage 
or gangrene won't set in. The worst thing is that we are not yet 
allowed to give her any tonic, for all STIMULANTS likely to aggravate 
the inflammation must be avoided. We have all had some really 
anxious days and nights, and I myself have been doubly anxious 
since I don't really know how Karl is getting on, whether he is in 
Berlin, or where he  is. 278 There was no letter again today. 
Poor Lupus, how sorry I am for him, lying there helpless and in 
great pain, deprived of solicitous nursing and wholly à la merci of 
a rapacious LANDLADY, though in fact his afflictions are largely his 
own fault. What's the point of such awful pedantry, such 
conscientiousness? You ought to take the old gentleman more in 
hand and, above all, wean him from GIN and BRANDY, those 
arch-enemies of gout. Excuse this hasty note; there is so much to 
do and think about and today I have still to fit in a trip to town 
where a pawn ticket is  due—BUT  NEVER MIND, SO long as we pull 
Lenchen through, and my beloved Karl soon sends good tidings. 
Warm regards from the girls and from your

My dear Mr Engels, 
Hitherto I have sent you so many epistles of complaint that I

it is humanly possible to say, Lenchen will recover. The doctor is 
very satisfied with her condition and extremely optimistic. The 
rambling, singing, weeping and raving that so alarmed us has 
subsided to a great extent, and a MUTTON CHOP has just been taken

up to her. Your help enabled me to give her all the COMFORTS, a 
constantly warm room, wine, and even the luxury of eau de 
Cologne, which is such a great help in an illness like this, 
particularly in view of the frequent fainting fits. Besides this good 
news,  I can at long last report the safe arrival of a letter from 
Moor. 42 He has been in Berlin since Sunday3  and is staying with 
Lassalle, who welcomed him with the greatest affability. At one 
dinner he sat between the daughter of Babylon b (shades of 
Weerth') and the indescribably ugly Ludmilla/ I wish him joy! 
Apart from that, he doesn't go into any details, for he was in a 
hurry to send off 50 talers to me. He simply says that prospects 
are good and that he won't come home empty-handed. I only fear 
that his home-coming may be somewhat further delayed. With 
warmest regards from us all.

Dear Mr Engels, 
I find it incomprehensible that Moor shouldn't have written to

FAMILY AFFAIRS, and even hoped I might learn further details from 
you, since this time my dear lord and master's letters to me are

main, most satisfactory. To begin at the beginning. The unclea has 
fallen in with all the son's648  proposals and, as soon as Karl arrives 
in Bommel, will settle the financial business. Now, as to the 
rumours in the papers, they are all wrong, as you no doubt 
supposed, nor has it ever remotely occurred to Karl that the family 
might move to and settle down in Berlin. What he did propose 
to effect there, however, was his renaturalisation. M2 I don't 
quite understand this and don't know why Karl should be in such 
a hurry to become a Royal Prussian 'subject' again. I'd rather have 
remained a 'stray groschen' b (red Wolffs' late-lamented threepen­
ny bit) a while longer. Negotiations over this have prolonged his 
stay in Berlin. The government wanted to settle the matter by 
according him Berlin citizenship with which Karl refused to be 
satisfied, and thus the whole business has dragged on from day to 
day. Today Karl writes to say that he doesn't expect to hear for 
certain before the 12th and until then must continue to be bored 
stiff.  Little Izzy still seems addicted to drivelling and the 
speculative notion. In other respects, he really gave proof of the 
utmost friendship for Karl, whose inseparable companion he has 
been. Now, Moor would have proceeded straight from Berlin to 
Bommel, had he not received from his mother an invitation, which 
has left him undecided whether or not he should go to Trier. If 
he does go there, it means yet more delay before he comes home, 
and he could hardly be here before a fortnight is out. 278 Lassalle's 
head seems to be filled with dreams of a great newspaper; he also 
maintains that he could contribute 20,000 talers to it. But what a 
risky venture for Karl—a daily paper, and on the countess's own 
ground, too! ri I myself feel small longing for the fatherland, for 
'dear', beloved, trusty Germany, that mater  dolorosa  of poets—and 
as for the girls! The idea of leaving the country of their precious 
Shakespeare appals them; they've become English to the marrow 
and cling like limpets to the soil of England. It's a good thing your 
warrant has been withdrawn1 '; thus you're free to go, after all. I 
assume that Schily and Imandt will be in the same category as 
yourself.  Yesterday I had news of the former through Rheinlän­
der. For months the poor fellow has been so ill and miserable that 
he finds it difficult even to write and it costs him a tremendous 
effort to drag himself from one place to another. His friends, it 
seems, had pretty well given him up and believed him to be

of all quack medicines. The extent of the havoc wrought by these 
poisonous pills may be gauged from the fact that he actually feels 
somewhat drawn to the National Association.24  (At its last meeting 
here,  Hans Ibeles" and Rudolf Schramm had a fearful set-to— 
Schramm launched a furious onslaught upon the reverend 
gentleman who, replying with priestly unction, was accorded the 
laurels by a good-for-nothing audience made up of clerks, 
Islington choristers, etc.) Rheinländer had also had a letter from 
Schily with news about la Moïse. h Sauernheimer,' the general, who 
had for many years been her lover, was getting married; to protect 
himself against Mrs Hess, who had threatened to create a public 
scandal in the church, he surrounded himself with a number of 
policemen. Mrs H. was not allowed into the church and had to 
content herself with parading in all her finery outside the church 
door. She is said to lead a very gay life and for a change, when 
things are bad, to do sewing for a German tailor. From time to 
time,  she calls on Schily who can never forget having often seen 
her tipsy in Geneva. Besides this tragi-comical affair, he also 
relates that in Paris Mirés is said to have advanced Eugénie 11 vast 
sums for the Pope, e and that 'little Mathilde',' too, is in bad odour. 
I was most interested to hear from you about the Lancashire 
STRIKES, since it's impossible to get a clear idea of what's going on 
from the newspapers.M9  At any rate, inopportune though this 
opposition on the part of the English workers may be, and 
unedifying as are its results, it is a heartening manifestation by 
comparison with the Prussian workers' movement and the social 
question in the shape it assumes over there—namely, Schulze-
Delitzsch, cum the capital-loving Straubingers, 650 their savings 
banks and distress funds! 
As regards Lenchen's health, it is improving steadily, if only very 
slowly. She is still very, very weak, but is already spending hours 
out of bed, and today she even walked up and down outside the 
house in the sunshine. 
I am glad to hear that poor Lupus is back on his feet again. 
Please give him my warmest regards; similarly the girls ask me to 
send you their most cordial regards with this gossipy scrawl. 
Let us hear from you again soon. With warm regards,

Apropos. I really cannot resist depicting for you a little scene 
from life in London. A week ago last Wednesday, immediately 
after dinner, I saw a vast concourse outside our door; all the 
children of the neighbourhood had gathered round a man who 
was lying flat on his face outside our house. Never in my life have 
I seen anything like it. No Irishman, in the depths of degradation, 
could equal this skeleton. Moreover, the man, clad in filthy rags, 
appeared to be unusually tall. When I arrived on the scene, 
neighbours had already brought out food and SPIRITS, but in vain. 
The man lay there motionless, and we thought he must be dead. I 
sent for a POLICEMAN. When the latter had arrived and taken a look 
at him, he at once addressed him as 'Yoi MKAN IMPOSTOR!' and dealt 
him a blow that sent his hat flying, after which he picked him up 
like a PARCEL and shook him. And who did I find staring straight at 
me with perplexed, despairing eyes?—the Laplander3! You can 
imagine my horror. He went staggering off and I sent after him 
with some money which, however, he refused. He said to Marian: 
'No, please, I don't need money', and set it down on a stone, then 
called out to the POLICEMAN, 'THAIS  FOR  YOUR ATTENTION.' Sad, is it not?

My dear Mrs Markheim, 
On Saturday, just as we were about to sit down at table, I 
received a letter addressed in an unfamiliar hand. Being more 
used to getting disagreeable letters than cheerful ones, I resolved 
to put aside this strange luncheon guest. But the children said

'open it, there may be something nice inside', and how pleasantly 
surprised I was, how moved and grateful when I found it was an 
indirect token of your existence and your affection, and that you 
had again been thinking of me with love, loyalty and sympathy, 
without so much as a reminder on my part. 
I am certain that it will be some sort of satisfaction to you to 
learn that your unexpected contribution has helped us—indeed 
made it possible—to send little Jenny to a seaside resort, a course 
which, in the doctor's opinion, has, alas, again become a sad 
necessity. The poor child is again suffering from a most obstinate 
cough, which has failed to respond either to medicines or to the 
warm summer weather but which will, I trust, be banished by sea 
air and bathing." 
The other two are cheerful and well. Laura now accompanies 
her Papa on many of his visits to the British Museum, to which 
end she has been given a TICKET. The little oneb has just moved 
out of the 'spelling' stage into that of 'reading with obstacles'—not 
exactly a race. Grimm's fairy tales are a great delight to her and 
Snow-White, Sleeping Beauty, King Thrushbeard and Brother 
Merry are now the heroes of her childish fantasies. 
My dear Karl had a great deal of trouble with his liver this 
spring. However, despite all the setbacks, his book is now making 
gigantic strides towards completion.' It would have been finished 
sooner, had he kept to his original plan of limiting it to 20 or 30 
sheets.'1 But since the Germans really believe only in 'fat' books,' 
and the far more subtle concentration and elimination of all that is 
superfluous counts for nothing in the eyes of those worthies, Karl 
has added a lot more historical material, and it is as a volume of 
50 sheets that it will fall, like a bomb, on German soil. Alas for our 
German soil! Abroad, one feels almost ashamed of being a 
German—and as for the honour of being 'Prussian'! Could 
anything be more pitiful than the spectacle presented by Prussia? 
It is difficult to say which is the more deplorable, the king, the 
ministers, the camarilla—or the servile populace and, above all, 
the miserable, cowardly, toadying, silent press! One often feels 
tempted to turn away in disgust from all politics, and indeed I 
wish we could observe the scene purely as 'amateurs'; but for us, 
unfortunately, it always remains a vital question. 
Karl hopes to go to Germany in September. Perhaps he will see 
Dr. K.f then, too, and will be in your vicinity as well. Do, please,

Hampstead, 12 October 1863 
My dear Mrs Markheim, 
On writing the date, I now see to my great dismay that I have 
let more than a month go by without answering your last kind 
letter. I got it just after we returned home from Hastings  r'4H and, 
for many petty and mundane reasons, failed to reply at once and, 
as you know, nothing is more dangerous in correspondence than 
procrastinating instead of responding to the first warm impulse of 
the heart and at once setting one's pen at a canter, lest the nib 
become encrusted with ink. I am not only pleading on my own 
behalf today, I must also put in a word for my lord and master, 
who in this respect has a much blacker list of sins with which to 
reproach his guilty conscience. He has, of course, received Dr 
Kugelmann's letter," and I really have no excuse to offer for his 
failure to write, other than to say that, in general, he is one of the 
worst correspondents the world has ever known and often keeps 
his oldest and best friends waiting for months, even years. If he 
now treats Dr K. in the same manner as he does his oldest and 
best friends, he (Dr K.) must be good enough to make allowances 
for such dilatoriness, and I trust that you, my dear Mrs 
Markheim, will put in a good word on his  behalf.  Should he not 
write very soon, it will, I imagine, be because he hopes to see him 
in person in the not too distant future; just as it is his intention to

We are closely following the course of events in our fatherland 
but, with the best will in the world, I cannot share your opinion

IN BERLIN 
[London, about 24 November 1863] 
My dear Mr Liebknecht, 
When I last wrote to your dear wife, I had little conception of 
the horrifying days lying immediately ahead of us. For 3 weeks my 
beloved Karl was desperately ill, for he was suffering from one of 
the most dangerous and painful illnesses—a CARBUNCLE on his back. 
I need add nothing to those few lines. You and your dear wife 
know how much you mean to us. Nor, even if I wanted to, could I 
tell you in detail all we went through during these weeks, so I will 
say no more and, at the behest of my beloved husband, now on 
the road to recovery, pass on to you the enclosed circular, issued 
by the Workers' Society.''52 Aside from the interest attaching to 
Polish affairs, it was, I believe, sent into the world to put a stop to 
the 'pro-police movement' on the part of certain persons. ' The 
'Chair' at once swallowed the thing hook, line and sinker, and 
asked for 50 copies for distribution to the communities.d  Karl is 
sending it to you to make you au fait with the matter. 
All the same, now that I have executed my task, let me just tell 
you how our family afflictions began. Karl had already been ailing

for months, he found it intensely difficult to work and, in an 
attempt to find some alleviation, smoked twice as much as usual, 
and took three times as many pills of various  kinds—BLUE  AND 
AMIBILIOUS,  etc. About 4 weeks ago he got a boil on his cheek; 
though it was very painful, we got the better of it with the usual 
household remedies. Before it had quite gone, a similar one 
erupted on his back. Although it was inordinately painful and the 
swelling grew daily worse, we were foolish enough to believe we 
would be able to get rid of it with poultices, etc. Also, in 
accordance with German ideas, my poor Karl almost completely 
deprived himself of food, even eschewing the miserable 4 ALE, 3 and 
lived on lemonade. At last, when the swelling was the size of my 
fist and the whole of his back misshapen, I went to Allen. Never 
shall I forget the man's expression when he saw that back. He 
waved me and little Tussy out of the room, and Lenchen had to 
hold Karl while he made a deep, deep incision, a great gaping 
wound from which the blood came pouring out. Karl remained 
calm and still, and did not flinch. Then began a round of hot 
poultices, which we have now been applying night and day every 2 
hours,  like clockwork, for the past fortnight. At the same time, the 
doctor ordered 3-4 glasses of port, and half a bottle of claret daily, 
and four times as much food as usual. The object was to restore 
the strength he had lost so as to help him withstand the frightful 
pain and the debilitating effect of the heavy discharge of pus. 
That is how we have spent the last fortnight—I need tell you two 
no more. Lenchen also fell ill from worry and exertion but is a 
little better again today. Whence I myself drew strength, I cannot 
tell. The first few nights I was the only one to sit up with him, for 
a week I took it in turns with Lenchen, and now I sleep on the 
floor in his room, so as to be always at hand. How I feel, now that 
he's recovering, you wûll be able to guess. 
He sends you both his cordial regards, as do my poor 
daughters. Please write, both of you, as soon as you can and as 
much as you can. He greatly enjoys getting letters. Please excuse 
my writing so incoherently.

JENNY MARX TO KARL FRIEDRICH MORITZ ELSNER 
IN BRESLAU 6 
[London, middle of June 1864]

Haverstock Hill 
Dear Sir, 
We assume you are the author of the fine obituary of our late, 
dear friend W.  Wolff,  which appeared in the Breslauer Zeitung. c 
My husband is anxious to write a detailed biography of him, but 
a See this volume, p. 539. - b  Polish name: Wroclaw. -  < [K. F. M. Eisner,]

has no material whatever on the earlier phases of our friend's 
life.' 121 You would be doing him a great service if you could help 
him in this respect by passing on to him in as much detail as 
possible everything you know about  Wolff,  especially his childhood 
and the earlier part of his life. We have been on the closest terms 
with him ever since 1845. Hence what we are concerned with is 
rather the earliest period of his life. My husband, who has just 
recovered from a grave and very wearisome illness, has directed 
me to ask you, Sir, as an old and trusted friend of the deceased, to 
do us this kindness, and I hope that you will soon pass on to us 
everything you can call to mind about our dear, dear  Wolff. 
With cordial regards from my husband and  myself. 
Yours, 
Jenny Marx, 
née von Westphalen

NOTES 
1 An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: Karl Marx and 
Friedrich Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary and 
Notes,  Martin Lawrence Ltd., London [1934]. Marx began his letter on a form 
of the General Bank of Switzerland under the letter from Freiligrath, who was 
manager of the bank's London branch.— 3 
2 The Cologne trial (4 October-12 November 1852) was organised and stage-
managed by the Prussian government. The defendants were members of the 
Communist League arrested in the spring of 1851 on charges of 'treasonable 
plotting'. The forged documents and false evidence presented by the police 
authorities were not only designed to secure the conviction of the defendants 
but also to compromise their London comrades and the proletarian organisa­
tion as a whole. Seven of the defendants were sentenced to imprisonment in a 
fortress for terms ranging from three to six years. The dishonest tactics 
resorted to by the Prussian police state in fighting the international 
working-class movement were exposed by Engels in his article 'The Late Trial 
in Cologne' and, in greater detail, by Marx in his pamphlet Revelations 
Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see present edition, Vol.  11).—  3, 22, 
44, 54, 72, 80, 135, 140, 375 
3 The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 
1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the 
Just (an organisation of German craftsmen and workers, and also of emigrant 
workers of other nationalities). After the reorganisation of the League of the 
Just in the summer of 1847 and the founding of the Communist League, the 
latter's local communities played the leading role in the Society. During various 
periods of its activity, the Society had branches in working-class districts in 
London. In 1847 and 1849-50, Marx and Engels took an active part in the 
Society's work, but on 17 September 1850 Marx, Engels and a number of their 
followers withdrew because the Willich-Schapper sectarian and adventurist 
faction had succeeded in temporarily increasing its influence in the Society and 
caused a split in the Communist League (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 483 
and 632). In the late 1850s, Marx and Engels resumed their work in the 
Society. It existed until 1918 when it was closed down by the British 
government.—3,  94, 103, 232, 342, 517, 533

4 This refers to the refusal by Freiligrath, former member of the Communist 
League and an editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, to help Marx unmask the 
Bonapartist agent Carl Vogt. In a statement published in the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung on 15 November 1859, he declared that he had nothing to 
do with the accusations levelled at Vogt. In so doing, he virtually dissociated 
himself from the attempts to establish the author of the anonymous anti-Vogt 
flysheet Zur Warnung, which had been launched by Karl Blind and was falsely 
attributed to Marx by Vogt. Marx deals with the matter in Herr Vogt (present 
edition, Vol. 17) and in his letters to Engels of 19 and 26 November 1859, and to 
Fieiligrath of 23 and 28 November 1859 (present edition, Vol.  40).—3,  9, 11 
5 The Association of German Men was an organisation of German refugees in 
London set up after the defeat of the 1848-49 revolution in Germany.—4, 309 
6 An ironic reference to Gottfried Kinkel, who had named the weekly he was 
publishing in London Hermann after Arminius (Hermann), chieftain of the old 
German tribe of Gheruscans.—4 
7 County-court—local judicial court for civil actions in England.—4, 327, 399 
8 Marx means his work on the second instalment of A Contribution to the Critique 
of Political Economy (see also Note 35).—4, 17. 23, 274, 280 
9 On 26 November 1859, the Allgemeine Militär-Zeitung (No. 95-96) carried a 
review of Engels' anonymously published pamphlet Po and Rhine. It endorsed 
Engels' critique of the theory that Germany's security depended on German 
domination of Northern Italy.—4 
10 In October 1859, the Abolitionist farmer John Brown, at the head of a band of 
< i^liicen (including five Blacks), seized a government arsenal of Harper's Ferry, 
Virginia, in an attempt to provoke an insurrection of slaves in the Southern 
states.  The band was surrounded by regular troops and almost wholly 
destroyed. Brown was seriously wounded. He and five of his comrades were 
tried and hanged in Charleston. The Brown uprising started a mass anti-slavery 
movement (see Note  12).—  4, 7 
1 ' Marx followed the movement for the emancipation of peasants in Russia using 
a variety of sources, among them the Prussian Allgemeine Zeitung. In the 
present case, he presumably drew on an article 'Rußland und Polen', reprinted 
in the Allgemeine Zeitung of 6 December 1859 (No. 340) from the Neue 
Hannoversche Zeitung, and the article by the Allgemeine Zeitung's St. Petersburg 
correspondent 'Zur russischen Leibeigenschaftsfrage und die Finanz-
Verhältnisse des Staats', Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 3 (supplement) and No. 5 
(supplement), 3 and 5 January, 1860.—4 
12 There was an abortive black uprising in the town of Bolivar, Missouri, in 
December 1859. Marx refers to a note published in the New-York Daily Tribune 
on 30 December 1859 (No. 5830).—4, 7 
'•^ In his letter of 16 December 1859 (it has not been found) Marx probably asked 
Szemere to help him out of his financial difficulties. In his reply of 
29 December Szemere informed Marx that his efforts had been to no avail.— 5 
14 On 11 December 1859 Szemere wrote to tell Marx that he intended to publish 
a pamphlet on Hungary and asked Marx to help him in having it translated 
into English and published in Britain. Szemere's pamphlet appeared in Paris in 
1860 under the title La Question hongroise (Î848-1860) and in London, in

Bentley's publishing house, the same year, under the title Hungary, from 1848 to 
I860.—5 
15 Marx means his letter to Lassalle of 22 November 1859 (see present edition, 
Vol. 40) criticising the latter's tactics on the question of Germany's and Italy's 
unification as set forth in Lassalle's pamphlet Der italienische Krieg und die 
Aufgabe Preußens. Eine Stimme aus der Demokratie (see Note 52).—  6, 11, 17 
6 An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: Marx and Engels, 
On the United States, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1979.—  7 
7 Marx sent articles to the New-York Daily Tribune on Tuesdays and Fridays; 27 
January 1860 was Friday.—  7 
8 At Cabo Negro (a mountain ridge in Morocco) a battle of the 1859-60 
Spanish-Moroccan war was fought in mid-January 1860 (see also Engels' article 
'The Moorish War', present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 554-55).—  7 
9 This refers to press reports about the Prussian government's intention to 
submit a bill to the Diet providing for longer army service and a bigger military 
budget. The bill, tabled on 9 February 1860, was rejected by the Diet's liberal 
majority, and this precipitated a Constitutional crisis (see Note 290). The 
proposed reform of the Prussian army was discussed by Engeis in the articles 
'Preparations lor War in Prussia' (present edition, Vol. 17) and 'The Prussian 
Military Question and the German Workers' Party' (Vol. 20).—  7 
•° On 24 January 1860, Britain and France signed a commercial treaty which 
envisaged a temporary reduction of import duties on English cottons and 
woollens and French silks and the lifting, from July 1860, of duties on 
imported raw materials.— 8 
>] This refers to Fischel's pamphlet Despoten als Revolutionäre, published 
anonymously in Berlin in 1859. The same year it appeared in English under 
the title The Duke of Coburg's Pamphlet. See also p. 153 of this volume.—8 
12 When writing this letter, Marx evidently had not yet received Vogt's pamphlet. 
What he calls the introduction was actually the second section. The first 
contained a verbatim report of the court proceedings against the Allgemeine 
Zeitung in Augsburg in October 1859. Vogt had sued the newspaper for 
reprinting, in June of that year, Karl Blind's anonymously published pamphlet 
Warnung zur gefälligen Verbreitung, which exposed him as a Bonapartist agent 
(Marx calls it, for brevity, Zur Warnung; for details of it see his polemic Herr 
Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 111-32). 
Marx likens Vogt's piece to the petty-bourgeois democrat Müller-Tellering's 
libellous pamphlet Vorgeschmack in die künftige deutsche Diktatur von Marx und 
Engels (Cologne, 1850)!—9 
•' By the gang of imperial rascals (Reichshalunkenbande) Marx means Karl Vogl 
and his associates, an allusion to the fact that Vogt had been a member of the 
Imperial Regency (see Note 154). Marx also often sarcastically refers to him as 
the 'Imperial Vogt', the German word Vogt being the medieval name for 
bailiffs appointed by the German Emperor.—10, 12, 23, 34 
14 The German National Association (Deutscher National-Verein) was the party of 
the German liberal bourgeoisie favouring the unification of Germany (without 
Austria) under the aegis of the King of Prussia. The Association was set up in 
Frankfurt am Main in September 1859. Its supporters were nicknamed Little 
Germans.—10, 160, 164, 192, 200, 319, 342, 383, 393, 511, 580

25 Lassalle took an unseemly stand on Marx's controversy against Vogt. In 
November 1859 he had virtually prevented Marx from publishing a declaration 
against Vogt and Blind in the Volks-zeitung (see present edition, Vol. 17, 
pp. 8-9). In this connection Marx wrote to Engels, on 26 November, that 
Lassalle was, in effect, 'piping the same tune as Vogt' (present edition, Vol. 40, 
p. 542). In late January 1860, after the publication of Vogt's libellous pamphlet 
Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung, Lassalle wrote to tell Marx of his 
displeasure with the latter for sharing the opinion, current in democratic 
circles, that Vogt was a paid Bonapartist agent. In a letter written at the 
beginning of February, Lassalle sought to dissuade Marx from bringing a 
lawsuit against the National-Zeitung for reprinting Vogt's calumnies.—10, 252, 
257, 478 
2e In 1859 and 186W, Fischel was editing in Berlin Das Neue Portfolio. Eine 
Sammlung wichtiger Documente und Aktenstücke zur Zeitgeschichte, a collection of 
diplomatic documents modelled on The Portfolio, or a Collection of State Papers, 
published by Urquhart in London from 1835 to 1837. 
Excerpts from Marx's Lord Palmerston (see present edition, Vol. 12, 
pp. 341-407) appeared in Fischel's Portfolio, Hefte I and II, 1859-60.—10, 152 
27 The Foreign Affairs Committees were public organisations run by the Urquhart and 
his supporters in a number of English cities between 1840s and 1860s, mainly with 
the aim of opposing Palmerston's policies.—10, 95 
28 This referts to the pamphlet Juchhe nach Italia!, written by Bamberger in Paris 
and published, with Vogt's help, anonymously by Reinhold Waist in Frankfurt 
am Main, but marked 'Bern und Genf,  Vogts Verlag, 1859' on the title page. It 
contained no direct polemic against Engels' articles on the Italian campaign in 
the Volk (see present edition, Vol. 16).—10 
29 On 12 January 1860, Hermann Orges, editor of the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung, published a statement in that paper refuting the fabrications about him 
in Vogt's pamphlet Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung (see also Engels' 
letter to Marx of 31 January 1860 in this volume).—10 
30 Marx means the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 3) 
whose offices were in Great Windmill Street, Soho, i" the 1850s.—11 
31 This refers to Vogt's pamphlet Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung. On 
Tellering's 'concoction' see Note 22.—12 
32 In a letter written in late January 1860, Lassalle informed Marx that Vogt had, 
on his own admission, been receiving money from Hungarian revolutionaries. 
At the same time, Lassalle sought to exonerate Vogt and expressed doubts 
about his having been bought directly by Louis Bonaparte's government.—12 
33 Here Marx replies to Lassalle's attacks on Liebknecht. In the above-mentioned 
letter Lassalle urged Marx to break off party relations with Liebknecht because 
Liebknecht contributed to the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung.— 12 
34 Adolphe Chenu and Lucien de la Hodde were police spies and agents 
provocateurs, the former the author of the libellous concoction Les Con­
spirateurs. Les sociétés secrètes. La préfecture de police sous Caussidiere. Les 
corps-francs, the latter the author of the equally libellous La naissance de la 
République en février 1848, both published in Paris in 1850. Marx and Engels 
discussed the two books in a joint review in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.

Politisch-ökonomische Revue, No. 4, 1850 (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 311-
25).—12,  15 
35 Marx means the initial plan of his economic work, which envisaged the 
following books: 1) Capital, 2) Landed Property, 3) Wage Labour, 4) The State, 
5) Foreign Trade and 6) The World Market (see Marx's Preface to his 
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, present edition, Vol. 29). Book I 
was to comprise four sections: 1) Capital in General, 2) The Competition of 
Capitals, 3) Credit, 4) Joint-Stock Capital. The first instalment of Book I, A 
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, published in 1859, contained the 
two introductory chapters of the section 'Capital in General' (a chapter on the 
commodity and a chapter on money). The second instalment was to be wholly 
devoted to capital in general.—12, 435 
3(> In a letter written late in January 1860, Lassalle told Marx he considered it 
necessary to postpone the writing of his own work on political economy until 
the publication of Marx's book. Lassalle's book appeared in Berlin in 1864 
under the title Herr Bastiat-Schulze von Delitzsch, der ökonomische Julian, oder: 
Capital und Arbeit.—12 
:'7 This refers to Vogt's lawsuit against the Allgemeine Zeitung. See also 
Note 22.—13 
:is In 1860, Marx, engrossed in writing his polemic against Karl Vogt, interrupted 
the preparation of the second instalment of Book I of his economic work (see 
Note 35). It was not until the summer of 1861 that he resumed his economic 
studies.—14 
1,1 This refers to the Great Exhibition, the first world industrial and commercial 
fair, held in London from May to October 1851.—14 
40 An order to this effect was issued by the Elberfeld District President (Landrat) 
on 20 January I860.—15 
41 The Landwehr was part of Prussia's armed forces and consisted of men who 
had done their term of active service and service in the reserve. Under Prussia's 
laws,  it was only raised in the event of war or the threat of war. The Prussian 
government's order to call up the Landwehr in the Rhine Province, issued at 
the beginning of May 1849, precipitated a popular uprising in Rhenish Prussia. 
In Elberfeld, Iserlohn, Solingen and a number of other cities, the Landwehr 
joined the movement in support of the Imperial Constitution. After the defeat 
of the uprising, many of the insurgents were forced to emigrate. Landwehr 
members guiltv of breaches of army discipline were subject to the jurisdiction of 
courts-martial. This applied also to ex-members of the Landwehr returning to 
Prussia from exile.—15, 249, 290, 299 
42 This letter by Marx has not been found.—15, 17, 33, 34, 40, 71, 77, 104, 118,

550, 567, 578 
43 For Vogt's attacks on  Wolff,  see Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17, 
pp. 72-73.—16 
44 In late 1859, the German socialist Eichhoff was brought to trial by the Prussian 
authorities for publishing in the London weekly Hermann a series of articles 
exposing the part played by Wilhelm Stieber, chief of the Prussian political 
police, in organising the trial of the Communist League members in Cologne in 
1852. 

=====第634页=====
598 Notes 
In December 1859, Hermann Juch, the editor of the weekly, asked Marx for 
information on the Cologne trial, which he needed for Eichhoff's defence (see 
Marx's letter to Engels of 13 December 1859, present edition,Vol. 40 and also 
pp. 80-81 of this volume). In May 1860 a Berlin court sentenced Eichhoff to 14 
months imprisonment.—16, 22, 54, 74, 80, 140, 197 
45 In his letter of 15 January 1860, Szemere told Marx that, if he was very busy, 
he, Szemere, could himself find a translator for his book La Question hongroise 
(1848-1860) (see also Note 14).—17 
46 This refers to the war between the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) and France 
on the one hand, and Austria on the other (29 April to 8 July 1859).—18, 103, 
125, 181 
47 The supplement to the Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 28 (28 January 1860), carried 
statements by its editor Altenhöfer and a journalist called Hafner denying, in 
rather vague terms, the accusations against them in Vogt's pamphlet Mein  Prozess 
gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung.— 18, 34 
48 Lassalle's letter to Marx of late January 1860 (see notes 32 and 33).—18 
49 This refers to the separate peace concluded by Prussia with the French 
Republic in Basle on 5 April 1795. It was the result of French victories and 
French diplomatic skill in exploiting the differences between members of the 
first anti-French coalition, above all Prusso-Austrian friction. The peace with 
Prussia initiated the collapse of the coalition; Spain concluded a separate peace 
treaty with France in Basle on 22 July 1795.—19 
50 Late in January 1860, Lassalle wrote to Marx (see notes 32, 33 and 48) that 
Vogt's pamphlet Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung had been printed in 
3,000 copies and all had been sold.—19 
51 Engels evidently means the book Lassalle was writing, Herr Bastiat-Schulze von 
Delitzsch... (see Note 36).—20 
52 An allusion to the fact that, during the 1859 Italian war, Lassalle in effect 
supported Napoleon Ill's interference in Italy's affairs, camouflaged as struggle 
for its 'liberation', and was in agreement with Vogt on this issue. Lassalle set 
forth his views on the problem in the most concentrated form in his pamphlet 
Der italienische Krieg und die Aufgabe Preußens. Eine Stimme aus der Demokratie, 
published anonymously in Berlin at the beginning of May 1859. In it, he also 
backed the Prusso-Bonapartist policy of neutrality for the German states in the 
Italian war and favoured the defeat of Austria, which Prussia should exploit to 
unite Germany from above.—20 
53 In his statement of 20 January 1860, published in the Allgemeine Zeitung, 
No. 24, on 24 January, the journalist Julius Fröbel, a petty-bourgeois democrat, 
described Vogt as a paid Bonapartist agent, and his conduct as 'high treason 
against the German nation'. Engels ridicules Lassalle, who, in a letter to Marx at 
the end of January 1860, argued against this statement.—20 
54 Engels means the annexation of Savoy and Nice by France as a result of the 
war it waged in alliance with Piedmont against Austria in 1859. This act 
exposed Napoleon Ill's aggressive designs.—20 
:'" Marx means his statement to the editor of The Free Press exposing 
petty-bourgeois democrat Blind's aiding and abetting the Bonapartist agenl 
Vogt. It was not published in The Free Press, but appeared in London on

4 February 1860 as a leaflet under the title 'Prosecution of the Augsburg 
Gazette' (its text is reproduced in Vol. 17 of the present edition, pp. 10-11). In 
a letter of 13 February 1860 (this volume, pp. 46-47) Marx informed Engels 
that excerpts from the statement had been printed by the Berlin Publicist. In 
some letters Marx referred to the statement as the 'English circular' or the 
'circular against Blind'.—21 
r><' This refers to Techow's letter to Schimmelpfennig of 26 August 1850, in 
which Techow gave a distorted rendering of a conversation he had had with 
Marx (see Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 75-99).—22, 52, 58, 
89, 133, 179, 568 
57 Marx probably means Otto Lüning's review, published in the Neue Deutsche 
Zeitung on 22, 23, 25 and 26 June 1850, of the first four issues of the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue. Lüning concentrated, in particu­
lar, on Marx's The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 and gave a distorted 
account of Marx's views on the dictatorship of the proletariat (for details see 
present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 387-88).—22 
58 Marx visited Engels in Manchester on 16 February and stayed until 25 March 
I860.—22, 28 
59 This refers to a note in The Times, No. 23533, 3 February 1860, on a statement 
by Vogt in connection with the annexation of Savoy and Nice then being 
prepared by France. To sidetrack attention from Napoleon Ill's real designs, 
Vogt declared that France was willing to let Switzerland have the neutral 
provinces of Savoy—Faucigny, Chablais and the Genevois —in return for the 
free use of the Simplon. The pro-Bonapartist content of this statement was 
exposed by Engels in the pamphlet Savoy, Nice and the Rhine (present edition, 
Vol. 16) and by Marx in Herr Vogt (present edition, Vol. 17, p. 195).—23, 25 
h" Marx means his attempts to make the petty-bourgeois democrat Blind publicly 
admit that he, Blind, was the author of the anonymous flysheet Zur Warnung 
(see Note 4). This was essential because Vogt, in his pamphlet Mein Prozess 
gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung, had attributed the flysheet to Marx. Marx also 
wished to expose, in the person of Blind, the cowardice of the petty-bourgeois 
democrats reluctant to come out openly against Bonapartist agents (see this 
volume, pp. 30-32 and 37, and present edition Vol. 17, pp. 111-32).—23, 179 
61 This refers to the meeting held in Brussels on 22 February 1848 by the 
Democratic Association to mark the second anniversary of the Cracow 
insurrection. Marx and Engels both made speeches (see present edition, Vol. 6, 
pp. 545-53). 
The Democratic Association was set up in Brussels in the autumn of 1847, 
with the active co-operation of Marx and Engels. It consisted of proletarian 
revolutionaries — mainly German refugees — and radical bourgeois and petty-
bourgeois democrats from other countries. Lucien Jottrand, a Belgian, was 
President, Marx was Vice-President for the Germans, and Joachim Lelewel, a 
leader of the democratic wing of the Polish emigration, was Vice-President for 
the Poles.—24, 102 
'''2 Marx reproduced Lelewel's reply, dated 10 February 1860, in the Appendices 
to his Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 322).—24 
03 This refers to the Communist League, the first German and international 
communist organisation of the proletariat, formed under the leadership of 
Marx and Engels in London early in June 1847 as a result of the reorganisation

of the League of the Just. The programme and organisational principles of the 
Communist League were drawn up with the direct participation of Marx and 
Engels. League members took an active part in the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution in Germany in 1848-49. After the defeat of the revolution, the 
League was reorganised and continued its activities. In the summer of 1850, 
differences arose between the supporters of Marx and Engels and the sectarian 
Willich-Schapper group, which tried to impose its adventurist tactics of 
immediately unleashing a revolution regardless of the existing conditions and 
practical possibilities. The discord led to a split within the League in September 
1850.  Because of police persecution and arrests of League members, the 
activities of the League as an organisation virtually ceased in Germany in May 
1851.  On 17 November 1852, on a motion by Marx, the League's London

82-84).—25,  44, 73, 78, 81, 92, 135 
64 Engels means an address by the Cologne Central Authority to the Communist 
League of 1 December 1850 ('Die Centralbehörde an den Bund'), drawn up by 
supporters of Marx and Engels, mainly by Bürgers. It fell into the hands of the 
Saxon (not Hanover) police at the arrest of League member Peter Nothjung in 
Leipzig on 10 May 1850 and was published, in June 1851, in the Dresdner 
Journal und Anzeiger and the Kölnische Zeitung (not the Hannoversche Zeitung).—

''•'' The original Brimstone Gang (Schwefelbande) was a students' association in Jena 
University in the 1770s whose members were notorious for their brawls. Later 
the expression Brimstone Gang came to be applied to any group of ill repute. 
In Geneva in 1849-50 it was also the jocular name for a small company of 
German refugees, inoffensive and happy-go-lucky idlers. In his pamphlet Mein 
Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung, Vogt included Marx and his party associates 
in the 'Brimstone Gang', although they had nothing to do with it (for details see 
this volume, pp. 70-71 and Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17, 
pp. 28-37).—28, 33, 42, 89, 121, 166, 179, 298 
66 Marx was trying to make Karl Blind admit that he, Blind, was the author of the 
flysheet Zur Warnung (see notes 4 and 60). In November 1859, Johann Wiehe, 
compositor at Fidelio Hollinger's press, where it had been printed, was forced 
by Blind and Hollinger to write a statement denying Blind's authorship (for the 
text of the statement see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 126). Karl Vogt 
reproduced Wiehe's statement in his pamphlet Mein  Prozess  gegen die Allgemeine 
Zeitung. However, on 8 February 1860, Wiehe took out an affidavit in a 
London police court which virtually confirmed Blind's authorship (see this 
volume, pp. 31-32, 37-38).—30

case.—  33

0 Later Marx learnt from Eduard Fischel's letter of 30 May 1860 that The Daily 
Telegraph's Berlin correspondent and the author of the item 'The Journalistic 
Auxiliaries of Austria', which contained a summary of Vogt's libellous 
pamphlet, was Karl Abel.—33, 58, 75, 131 
1 Wasserpolacken—the original name for the Oder ferrymen who were mainly 
natives of Upper Silesia; subsequently it became widespread in Germany as a 
nickname for Silesian Poles.— 33 
2 Marx wrote these letters to people who could supply material for his book 
against Vogt and his lawsuit against the National-Zeitung.— 33 
3 On Lassalle's criticism of Liebknecht see Note  33.—  35 
4 In mid-June 1850, Marx, through the Solingen worker Carl Wilhelm Klein, 
recommended to the Cologne District of the Communist League that Lassalle 
be admitted to the League. On 18 June, Peter Gerhard Reiser, a leader of the 
League's Cologne District, wrote to tell Marx that the Cologne communists 
could not admit Lassalle because he 'persists in his aristocratic attitudes and 
is not as concerned lor the working men's general welfare as he ought 
to be'. 
Tor the accusations levelled at Lassalle by Düsseldorf workers, see Marx's 
letter to Engels of 5 March 1856 (present edition, Vol. 40).— 35 
'5 This refers to the committee appointed to organise the celebrations of the 
centenary of Friedrich von Schiller's birth on 10 November 1859. Composed of 
petty-bourgeois regufees, it was headed by Gottfried Kinkel. — 35, 81, 226, 236 
'b Marx evidently means the plans for establishing a Schiller society in London 
similar to the one set up in Manchester in November 1859 in connection with 
the Schiller centenary (see Note 429).—35 
' The Patriots (Vaterlandsireunde) was a societv of German republican refugees 
in London in the 1850s and 1860s. It included, among others, Karl Blind, 
Ferdinand Freiligrath and Fidelio Hollinger.— 35 
8 On 11 February 1860, the compositor Vögele took out an affidavit confirming, 
in effect, that Blind was the author of the flysheet Zur Warnung (see Note 60). 
Marx reproduced the affidavit in Herr Vogt (present edition, Vol. 17, 
p. 319).—37, 39, 47, 53, 85 
9 Engels has in mind Marx's trip to Manchester (see Note 58).— 39 
" Marx had sent Vögele's deposition (for its text see this volume, p. 60) and a 
covering letter to the Editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung (see present edition,

Note 37).—41 
1 This refers to the so-called German-American revolutionary loan which Kinkel and 
other petty-bourgeois refugee leaders sought to float among German refugees 
and Americans of German extraction in 1851 and 1852. The funds raised were 
to be used for starting an immediate revolution in Germany. To publicise the 
loan, Kinkel went on a tour of the United States in September 1851, but it 
ended in failure. Marx and Engels denounced the whole undertaking as a futile 
and harmful attempt to produce a revolution artificially at a time when the 
revolutionary movement was at a low (see, in particular, Marx's Herr Vogt.

83 Obviously, Marx had not yet received Engels' letter of 12 February 1860 
informing him that his statement, 'To the Editors of the Volks-Zeitung. 
Declaration', had been published in the supplement to ihe Kninische Zeitung, 
No. 41, on 10 February.—47 
84 This refers to Borkheim's letter to Marx of 12 February 1860 setting forth the 
history of the 'Brimstone Gang' (see Note 65). Marx reproduced the letter in 
full in Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp.  29-32).—  48, 71 
8:> Marx means Euston Station in London.—49 
8(' As can be seen from Duncker's letter to Engels of 27 February 1860, he 
disagreed with Engels in assessing the stand taken by the various German 
political parties on the Italian question and therefore insisted on Savoy, Nice and 
the Rhine being published under the author's name. Engels, for his part, 
wanted a mere statement that the pamphlet was by the author of Po and Rhine 
(see this volume, p. 25 and Note 68).—50 
87 This refers to the refutation by Marx and Engels of the slanderous accusations 
levelled at the Communist League during the trial of communists in Cologne in 
1852.  See Marx's Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, Engels' 
'The Late Trial at Cologne' (present edition, Vol. 11), and Marx's The Knight of the 
Noble Consciousness (Vol.  12).—  51 
88 Engels means Vogt's lawsuit against the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung (see Note 
22).—52 
89 Two letters of 16 October 1859 from Hermann Orges, editor of the Allgemeine 
Zeitung, requesting Marx to send Vögele's statement concerning the provenance 
of the flysheet Zur Warnung. The statement was to be used as evidence against 
Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 123-24 and 317-18, and this volume, 
p. 66).—53,  63, 66 
90 In this letter Blind tried to prove that he had had nothing to do with the 
flysheet Zur Warnung. Marx reproduced the letter in his Herr Vogt (present 
edition, Vol. 17, p. 122).—53 
91 A rough draft of this letter has been preserved. It was published by M. Häckel 
in Freiligralh's Briefwechsel, Berlin, 1968. The texts of the draft and final version 
are practically identical.— 54 
92 Marx means the lawsuits he intended to bring against the Berlin National-
Zeitung and the London Daily Telegraph for reprinting Vogt's libellous 
fabrications against himself and his associates (sec also this volume, pp. 40-45, 
59-76).—54, 58 
9;i In a statement to the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung of 5 November 1859, 
published in the supplement to No. 319 of that paper on 15 November, 
Freiligrath declared that he had never contributed to the Volk newspaper and 
had been named among Vogt's accusers against his own will. A note by A. Z. 
editor Gustav Eduard Kolb, published together with the statement, claimed that 
the information in question concerning Freiligrath derived from Liebknecht's 
reports from London and a private letter of his dated 12 September 1859, 
which said, in particular: 'Should Vogt bring his action before London courts, 
and he is morally forced to do so, Marx and FYeiligrath will act as witnesses, 
and so will I.' It is this letter of Liebknecht's that Marx means here.—55

Notes 603 
94 An anonymous article by Blind on the Schiller centenary festival in London, 
published in The Morning Advertiser on 11 November 1859, described 
Freiligrath's jubilee poem as being 'above mediocrity'. In a letter to Marx dated 
17 November, Freiligrath hinted that this passage had been interpolated at 
Marx's request. For derails see Marx's letter to Engels of 19 November 1859, 
present edition, Vol. 40.—55 
95 The illustrated literary weekly Die Gartenlaube, No. 43, 1859, carried an article, 
'Ferdinand Freiligrath', signed 'B' (an abbreviation of 'Beta', the pen-name of 
Johann Heinrich Bettziech), which attributed the flagging of Freiligrath's 
powers as a poet to the 'influence' of Marx. See on this Marx's letters to Engels 
of 19 and 26 November and Engels' letter to Marx of 11 (or 12) December 
1859 (present edition, Vol. 40).—55 
96 Marx means Liebknecht's private letter to the Allgemeine Zeitung (see Note 93) 
and his statement of 15 November in the supplement to the A. Z., No. 327, of 
23 November 1859 in which Liebknecht stressed that he had never named 
Freiligrath among the accusers of Vogt. —56 
97 Marx had been misinformed. Vogt's pamphlet contained no letters by 
Freiligrath to Vogt. —56 
98 'La classe la plus laborieuse, et la plus misérable' is a paraphrase of Saint-Simon's 
expression 'la classe la plus nombreuse, et la plus pauvre'. —57 
99 Blind's statement in question, published in the supplement to the Allgemeine 
Zeitung, No. 44, on 13 February 1860, opened with the words: 'In his latest 
work, Vogt speaks of my "Russophobia" and my "mistrust".'—58 
100 The note, written by a German refugee in the USA (probably Georg Eduard 
Wiss) and forwarded to Marx by Cluss, described Lassalle as a man of extreme 
ambition, dangerous to any party because he would stop at nothing to achieve 
his ends.— 58 
101 Marx means his letter of 19 November 1852 notifying Engels of the dissolution 
of the Communist League (see present edition, Vol. 39, and this volume, 
p. 83).—59 
102 Marx means Biscamp!s article 'Der Reichsregent'. The words 'Der Reichsregent 
als Reichsverräter' ('The Imperial Regent as a traitor to the Empire') open one 
of its paragraphs. See also Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17,

took part in its deliberations. The Central Committee of the three democratic 
associations in Cologne, set up prior to the Congress, was confirmed as the 
Rhenish Regional Democratic Committee. At the initiative of the Communist 
League, a resolution was passed on the need to carry on work among the 
factory proletariat and the peasants.—70

107 This refers to the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see 
Note 3) which was headed by Willich and Schapper after the split of the 
Communist League.— 71 
108 In September 1851, a series of arrests was made in France among members of 
the Communist League local communities affiliated to the Willich-Schapper 
faction. The adventurist conspiratorial tactics of the faction had caused a split 
in the League in September 1850. In disregard of the obtaining conditions it 
aimed at engineering an immediate uprising. This enabled the French and 
Prussian police to fabricate the so-called complot franco-allemand (Franco-
German plot). Julien Cherval, an agent provocateur in the pay of the Prussian 
minister to Paris and, simultaneously, of the French police, succeeded in 
establishing himself as the leader of one of the League's Paris communities. In 
February 1852, the arrested were convicted on charges of sedition. Cherval was 
given a chance to escape from prison. The attempts by the Prussian police to 
implicate the League led by Marx and Engels in the Franco-German plot failed 
completely. Konrad Schramm, an associate of Marx arrested in Paris in 
September 1851, was soon released for lack of incriminating evidence. The 
trumped-up charges were nonetheless repeated by the Prussian police officer 
Stieber at the trial of communists in Cologne in 1852, which he had helped 
organise. Marx exposed Stieber's perjuries in the chapter 'The Cherval Plot' of 
his Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see present edition, 
Vol. 11, pp. 407-19).—72, 148 
109 As can be seen from Màrx's Herr Vogt (present edition, Vol. 17, p. 266) 
Schapper took out an affidavit to this effect at the Police Court at Bow Street 
on 1 March I860.—78 
110 Marx means the differences on organisational questions that arose in the 
summer of 1850 between the Communist League Central Authority in London 
and the Cologne District Authority. The position of the former was set forth by 
Marx and Engels in the June 'Address of the Central Authority to the League' 
(see present edition, Vol. 10). In a number of letters to London that summer 
League members in Cologne expressed reservations about certain propositions 
in the 'Address'.— 81 
111 The Communist Club in New York was set up in 1857 at the initiative of the 
German revolutionary refugees Friedrich Kamm and Albrecht Komp. Marx's 
associates Joseph Weydemeyer, Friedrich Adolph Sorge, Hermann Meyer and 
August Vogt were active members.— 81 
112 Marx means his letters to Weydemeyer of 1 February 1859 (see present edition, 
Vol. 40) and to Komp, presumably of the same date (not found).—81 
113 Gustav Levy visited Marx in London in late February 1856. On a previous visit, 
in the latter half of December 1853, he had come on a mission from Düsseldorf 
workers.— 82 
114 La Société des Saisons, active in Paris between 1837 and 1839, was a secret 
republican socialist organisation led by Auguste Blanqui and Armand 
Barbes.— 82 
113 An appeal of the committee organising support for the communists convicted 
in Cologne, written by Marx, was directed to German workers in America care 
of Adolph Cluss. On 10 January 1853, the latter incorporated it in a message to 
German Americans, which he published in the California Staats-Zeitung. Marx's 
text was also included in the 'Appeal for support of the representatives of the

tive council of the Socialist Gymnastic Society on 16 January 1853, and 
published in the New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung (see present edition, Vol. 11, 
pp. 621-25).—83 
llfi Marx evidently means the article by Ludwig Simon, former deputy to the 
Frankfurt National Assembly, containing sallies against him and Engels, of 
which Weydemeyer advised him in a letter of 10 March 1852.—84 
117 In an attempt to revive the mass Charter movement, in April 1857 Ernest 
Jones proposed calling a Chartist conference, to be also attended by John 
Bright, Charles Gilpin and other bourgeois radicals. In drafting the platform 
for union with the radicals, he made a number of important political 
concessions. Of the six points of the People's Charter (universal suffrage, 
annual Parliaments, vote by secret ballot, equal constituencies, abolition of 
the property qualifications for candidates to Parliament, and the payment of 
M.P.s) he retained only the demand for universal manhood suffrage. Jones' 
conciliatory policy caused discontent among the rank-and-file of the National 
Charter Association. After repeated postponements a joint conference of 
Chartists and bourgeois radicals was convened in London on 8 February 1858. 
A sharp critique of Jones' position is given in Marx's letters to Engels of 16 
January and 21 September and Engels' letters to Marx of 11 February and 
7 October 1858 (present edition, Vol. 40).— 85 
118 This is in reply to a passage in Lassalle's letter to Marx and Engels of late 
February 1860, which said: 'You [Marx] conclude your letter by passing on to 
me with a haughty gesture a message from Baltimore purporting to show that 
at least I have no grounds for complaining about your mistrust of me.' (See 
note 100).—88 
119 In his letter to Marx and Engels of late February 1860, Lassalle maintained that 
they were collecting a 'dossier' on him and that the note by Wiss (see Note 100) 
had been sent in reply to a request from them.— 89 
120 Not all of Marx's letters to Cluss for the period 1852-54 have been found. 
Some have reached us only in the form of excerpts quoted by Cluss in his 
letters to Weydemeyer (see present edition, Vol. 39). The letter Marx refers to 
here has not been found, either in full or in excerpt.—90 
121 Marx is dispelling Lassalle's suspicion that the persons named had something to 
do with the accusations levelled at him. Lassalle (see Note 74).—90 
122 The decision to transfer the Central Authority of the Communist League (see 
Note 63) from London to Cologne was adopted by the Authority at its session 
of 15 September 1850. Marx, Engels and- their supporters dissociated 
themselves from the faction led by August Willich and Karl Schapper, which 
set up a separate league with its own authority.— 90 
23 Marx means article XVIII from Engels' series Revolution and Counter-Revolution 
in Germany, which was published over Marx's signature in the New-York Daily 
Tribute in 1851-52. The article spoke highly of Bakunin's part in the Dresden 
insurrection in 1849 (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 90). See also the item 
'Michael Bakunin' by Marx (present edition, Vol.  12).—  91

126 The pam phlet Zwei politische Prozesse. Verhandelt vor den Februar-Assisen in Köln, 
published in Cologne in 1849, contained the minutes of the trial of that 
newspaper held on 7 February 1849 and of the trial of the Rhenish District 
Committee of Democrats, held on the following day. 
At the first trial, Karl Marx, as editor-in-chief, Frederick Engels, as 
co-editor, and Hermann  Korff,  as responsible publisher, were accused of 
insulting Chief Public Prosecutor Zweiffel and calumniating the police officers 
who arrested Andreas Gottschalk and Friedrich Anneke, in the article 'Arrests' 
published in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, No. 35, on 5 July 1848 (see present 
edition, Vol. 7, pp. 177-79). 
At the latter trial, Karl Marx, Karl Schapper and the lawyer Schneider II 
were charged with incitement to revolt in connection with the appeal by the 
Rhenish District Committee of Democrats of 18 November 1848 on the refusal 
ta pay taxes (see present edition, Vol. 8, p. 41). The jury acquitted the 
defendants in both cases. For the speeches of Marx and Engels at these trials 
see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 304-22, 323-39.-95 
127 This refers to the Revolutionary Centralisation, a secret organisation founded by 
German refugees, mostly petty-bourgeois democrats, in Switzerland at the 
beginning of 1850. 
Its Central Committee, based in Zurich, was headed by Tzschirner, a leader 
of the Dresden insurrection in May 1849; Fries, Greiner, Sigel, Techow, Schurz 
and J. Ph. Becker, all participants in the 1849 Baden-Palatinate uprising, were 
prominent members. The organisation included Communist League members 
d'Ester, Bruhn and others, as well as Wilhelm  Wolff.  In July and August 1850 
the leaders of the Revolutionary Centralisation approached members of the 
League's Central Authority with the proposal of a merger. On behalf of the 
Authority, Marx and Engels rejected the merger as potentially dangerous to 
the class independence of the proletarian party. By the end of 1850, the 
Revolutionary Centralisation had disintegrated as a result of the mass expulsion 
of German refugees from Switzerland.—97 
128 The March Association, with its headquarters in Frankfurt and branches in a 
number of German cities, was named after the March 1848 revolution in 
Germany and was set up by the petty-bourgeois democrats Julius Fröbel, 
Heinrich Simon, Arnold Rüge, Karl Vogt and other Left-wing deputies to the 
Frankfurt National Assembly late in November 1848. The Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung sharply attacked the Association's revolutionary phrase-mongering, 
indecision and inconsistency in fighting the counter-revolution (see the article 
'Ein Aktenstück des Märzvereins' in No. 181, 29 December 1848). See also 
Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 103-05.—100 
129 Agreement on the expulsion of Marx and several contributors to the 
revolutionary-democratic newspaper Vorwärts! was reached by Arnim, Prussian 
envoy to Paris, and Guizot, the French Minister, in December 1844. The 
expulsion order was issued by the French government in January 1845. On 
3 February, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels.—101 
130 This presumably refers to the lithographed circulars which Marx and Engels 
issued on behalf of the Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee. Only

(see Vol. 6 of the present edition).—102 
131 The German Workers' Society in Brussels was founded by Marx and Engels at 
the end of August 1847 for the political education of German workers living in 
Belgium. Run by Marx, Engels and their associates, it provided a legal centre 
for the propagation of scientific socialism and a rallying point for the 
revolutionary proletariat in Belgium. The finest members of the Society joined 
the Brussels community of the Communist League. The Society played an 
important part in establishing the Brussels Democratic Association. The 
Society's activities ceased soon after the February 1848 bourgeois revolution in 
France, when many of its members were arrested and expelled by the Belgian 
authorities.—102. 534 
132 Marx's work, based on the lectures on political economy which he gave in 
Brussels in the latter half of December 1847 (see also Note 610), was first 
published in 1849, as a series of editorials in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung under 
the heading Wage-Labour and Capital (present edition, Vol. 9). A draft outline 
of the concluding lectures on wage labour and capital was found among Marx's 
manuscripts. It is entitled Wages and bears, on the cover, the words: 'Brussels, 
December 1847'. For it see present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 415-37.—102 
133 Marx means the Belgian National Congress. Elected during the 1830 
revolution, it proclaimed the country's independence.—102 
134 This refers to the Democratic Association, of which Marx was a vice-president 
(see Note 61). In his letter of 25 February 1848, Jottrand requested Marx to 
withdraw his resignation. As a result, Marx decided to continue in his 
function.—102 
135 Marx's memory fails him here. On about 6 April 1848, he and Engels left Paris 
to take a direct part in the revolution in Germany.—102 
136 Marx means his election to the Rhenish District Committee of Democrats which 
was endorsed by the First Rhenish Congress of Democrats, held in Cologne on 
13 and 14 August 1848.—102 
137 Marx came from Paris to London on about 26 August 1849.—102

information which Marx needed for his book againsi Vogt. —113 
148 In the letter of 28 March 1860 Liebknecht wrote to Marx that the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung had given him notice as its correspondent, and requested 
Marx to help him find work as correspondent for some American newspaper. 
The letter, sent to Engels' address in Manchester, was, in the latter's absence 
(see Note 146), forwarded by Gumpert to Marx in London.—113 
149 The American Workers' League was a mass political organisation set up in New 
York on 21 March 1853. The majority of its members were immigrant 
German workers. Joseph Weydemeyer was on the League's organising Central 
Committee. The League worked for the establishment of trade unions, fought 
for higher wages and shorter hours, and sought to encourage independent 
political action by the workers. It virtually ceased its activities in 1855, but 
resumed them, in New York, in 1857, under the name of the General Labor 
Union. The Chicago Workers' Association, formed in 1857, was one of its 
branches. In 1860, it took over the leadership of US workers' organisations, 
while the General Labor Union ceased to exist.—115, 117, 118 
150 An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: Marx and Engels 
On the United States, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1979.—116 
151 This refers to the book Briefe von Alexander von Humboldt an Varnhagen von Ense 
aus den Jahren 1827 bis 1858, Leipzig, 1860, which was published, with Lassalle's 
help,  by Ludmilla Assing, niece of the German liberal writer Varnhagen von 
Ense. In the letter of 11 March 1860, Lassalle promised to send Marx a copy 
at once.— 116 
152 Gymnastic Clubs—organisations of German democratic emigrants, including 
workers, set up in the USA by former participants in the 1848-49 revolution. 
At a congress in Philadelphia on 5 October 1850 the Gymnastic Clubs united 
into a Socialist Gymnastic Association which maintained contacts with German 
workers' organisations in America and published the Turn-Zeitung, a newspaper 
to which Weydemeyer and Cluss contributed regularly in 1852 and 1853.—119 
153 Marx did not copy out the passage from Vogt's pamphlet in the draft of his 
letter. He did reproduce it in his Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, 
p. 70). He also reproduced the corresponding passage from Lommel's reply of 
13 April 1860 (p. 71).—119 
154 On 6 June 1849 the rump of the Frankfurt National Assembly, which had 
moved to Stuttgart, formed an Imperial Regency, consisting of five members of 
the Left faction (moderate democrats). Their attempts to enforce by

Assembly and rejected by the German princes failed completely. On 18 June 
the rump National Assembly was disbanded by Württemberg troops.—124 
Decembrist was Marx's way of referring to the Second Empire in France (an 
allusion to Louis Bonaparte's coup d'état of 2 December 1851).—126 
Marx plays on a passage from the ruling of 18 April 1860 by Lippe, Public 
Prosecutor at the Royal Municipal Court in Berlin, rejecting Marx's libel suit 
against Zabel on the grounds that 'no issue of public importance is raised by 
this matter which could make it desirable for me to take any action' (see this 
volume, p. 131).—129 
This refers to the attempt by a group of Geneva radicals, supporters of James 
Fazy, to seize, on 30 March 1860, the towns of Thonon and Evian (on the 
southern shore of Lake Geneva), which under the Turin treaty of 24 March 
1860 between France and the Kingdom of Sardinia were to be turned over to 
France (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 199-201).—129 
The original of Marx's letter bears the following pencil note, presumably by 
Rheinländer: 'Cherval came to Geneva from England in early 1853 (beginning 
of March or beginning of February) and stayed there for over a year, until his 
expulsion in the summer of 1854.'—130 
In his letter of 16 April 1860 Lassalle informed Marx that he was sending a 
printed copy of his as yet unpublished article 'Fichtes politisches Vermächtniß 
und die neueste Gegenwart', which was to appear in the Demokratische Studien 
published by Walesrode. In his article, Lassalle discussed Fichte's Politische 
Fragmente aus den Jahren 1807 und 1813 (J. G. Fichte, Sämmtliche Werke, Bd. 7, 
Berlin, 1846, S. 507-613).—131 
This refers to Siebel's trip to Switzerland (see Note 147).—132 
Under the 1858 Plombières agreement, France was to get Nice and Savoy for 
taking part in the forthcoming war against Austria on the side of the Kingdom 
of Sardinia. Although in the course of the Austro-Italo-French war (see 
Note 46) France violated the agreement by making a separate truce with 
Austria in Villafranca on 11 July 1859, it did, nonetheless, obtain Nice and 
Savoy under the Turin treaty of 24 March 1860.—132 
On 2 May 1860, the German journalist Eduard Fischel, a supporter of David 
Urquhart, the English conservative political writer, invited Marx to contribute 
to the Deutsche Zeitung, which was to be published, with Fischel's participation, 
in Berlin. For this, see Marx's letters to Fischel of 8 May and 1 June 1860 (this 
volume, pp. 136-37 and 143-44). For Marx's view of Fischel and the 
Urquhartites in general, see his letter to Lassalle of 2 June 1860 (this volume, 
pp. 152-55).—133, 137 
This refers to Napoleon III, who in 1846 escaped from prison wearing the 
clothes of a stonemason named Badinguet.—133, 159, 171, 350 
Marx means the letters of Emmermann to Schily of 29 April 1860 and of Beust 
to Schily of 1 May 1860, both of which contained libellous statements about 
Marx.—133 
Marx is referring to the events of the 1859-60 Italian bourgeois revolution— 
the peasant uprising in Sicily, started in April 1860, the insurrection in Palermo 
and the preparation of Garibaldi's expedition. On 11 May, three days after 
Marx wrote this letter, Garibaldi's 'Thousand' landed in Sicily. See also Marx's

names of the cities where he staged putsches: Strasbourg (30 October 1836), 
Boulogne (6 August 1840) and Paris (coup d'état of 2 December 1851, which 
culminated in the establishment of a Bonapartist dictatorship).—139, 456, 462,

168 -phe  papers  Reuter stole from Dietz were documents of the Willich-Schapper 
sectarian adventurist faction, which Dietz had joined after the split within the 
Communist League in the autumn of 1850 (for details see present edition, 
Vol. 11, pp. 403-07). The Communist League members tried in Cologne had 
had nothing to do with those documents.—140 
169 -phis refers to the so-called 'original minute-book' of the London Central 
Authority of the Communist League. A fabrication of Prussian police spies, it 
formed the basis of the prosecution's case at the Cologne trial of communists in 
1852 (for details see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 420-43).—141 
170 In reply to Marx's question about the programme of the Deutsche Zeitung, 
Fischel wrote on 30 May 1860 that one of its slogans was 'Black, red and gold' 
(i.e., the unification of Germany, black, red and gold being its national 
colours).—144, 493 
171 Marx thanks Fischel for informing him, in his letter of 30 May 1860, that 
K. Abel, and not a certain Meier, as Marx had previously assumed (see this 
volume, pp. 33 and 58), was the Berlin correspondent of The Daily 
Telegraph.—144 
172 Lassalle had suggested that Marx should go to Berlin to testify at the Eichhoff 
trial (see Note 44). The material on the police machinations attending the 
Communist trial in Cologne, mentioned below in this letter, was used by Marx 
in his polemic Herr Vogt, Appendix 4 (present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 64-67).—

173 On Marx's meeting with Hermann Juch see also his letters to Engels of 13 and 
20 December 1859 (present edition, Vol. 40).—146 
174 Marx means the sectarian adventurist faction led by August Willich and Karl 
Schapper that split away from the Communist League after 15 September 1850 
and formed an independent organisation with its own Central Authority (see 
also notes 63 and 108).—147 
175 To create a pretext for reprisals against political refugees, the British 
authorities in April 1853 accused the proprietors of a focket manufactory in 
Rotherhide, near London, of conspiratorial dealings with Kossuth, which Marx 
ironically calls 'Kossuth's gunpowder plot' by analogy with the Catholic 
gunpowder plot against James I of England in 1605. 
Ladendorf, Gercke, Falkenthal, Levy and several other petty-bourgeois 
democrats were arrested in 1853 on the strength of a denunciation by the police 
agent Hentze, a former member of the Communist League. They were sentenced 
to terms of imprisonment ranging from three to five years in 1854 on trumped-up 
charges of conspiracy.—148

176 This article, published in The Free Press under the headline 'Russian State 
Papers Respecting Her Recent Advance to Our Indian Frontiers', was based on 
Engels' article 'Russian Progress in Central Asia', which appeared as a leader in 
the New-York Daily Tribune on 3 November 1858 (present edition, Vol. 16). In 
preparing the article for The Free Press, Marx changed the opening and 
concluding sections.—152 
177 Here Marx draws on Eduard Fischel's letter to the Editor of The Free Press, 
published on 30 November 1859 under the headline 'The Coburg Pamphlet 
and Lord Palmerston'.—153 
178 The official residence of the British Prime Minister is in Downing Street.—

Marx of having sent him a parcel (presumably with material exposing Karl 
Vogt).— 155,  170 
lxo Engels stayed in Barmen from 23 March to 6 April 1860 in connection with the 
death of his father and, presumably, from 12 to 25 May in view of the grave illness 
of his mother.—156 
181 This refers to the 'Mémoire adressé à Lord Palmerston...' of 11 June 1859, in 
which Szemere, as former Prime Minister of Hungary, urged Palmerston to 
contribute to the efforts for Hungary's independence. Szemere included the 
'Mémoire' as a separate chapter in his book La Question hongroise (1848-1860).— 
157 
182 Marx drew this information from a letter of Victor Schilv dated 6 March I860. 
Schily's source was Nikolai Sasonow, a Russian émigré journalist, resident in 
Paris.  Sasonow also mentioned the lecture in his letter to Marx of 10 May 1860 
(Marx quotes it in Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol. 17, p. 42). The name of the 
Russian professor has not been established.—157, 194 
183 Napoleon III met Prince Regent William of Prussia and the princes of other 
German states in Baden-Baden on 15 to 17 June 1860. On this see Marx's 
articles 'The Emperor Napoleon III and Prussia' and 'Interesting from Prussia' 
(present edition, Vol. 17).—159 
184 At a sitting of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 12 May 1860, deputy 
Niegolewski of the Grand Duchy of Posen exposed the Prussian authorities' 
intrigues there.—159 
185 An excerpt from this letter was first published in: Marx and Engels, On 
Literature and Art, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1976, pp. 229-31.—160 
186 Engels quotes the old Danish folk song 'Elveskud' ('The Wood King's 
Daughter'). A German translation of it by Johann Gottfried Herder, entitled 
'Erlkönig', was put to music and became widely known. Another German 
translation, by Wilhelm Grimm, though philologically superior, failed to win 
popularity. No translation by Ludwig Uhland has been discovered.—160 
187 On 26 June 1849 the liberal deputies to the Frankfurt National Assembly, who 
had walked out after the Prussian King's refusal to accept the Imperial Crown, 
met in Gotha for a three-day conference which resulted in the formation of the 
Gotha party. It expressed the interests of the pro-Prussian German bourgeoisie 
and supported the policy of the Prussian ruling circles aimed at uniting 
Germany under the hegemony of Hohenzollern Prussia.—164

Marx of the rejection by the Berlin Royal Municipal Court, on 8 June 1860, of 
his libel suit against the National-Zeitung (see Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, 
Vol. 17, p. 271).—167, 169 
189 Vogt  had brought  his  suit against  the  Allgemeine Zeitung  in the Bavarian city  of 
Augsburg  (see  Note 22).—167 
190 An allusion to the fact that Lassalle, as well as Vogt, had contributed to the 
Demokratische Studien almanach published by Meisner in 1860. Among other 
items,  it contained Lassalle's article 'Fichtes politisches Vermächtniß und die 
neueste Gegenwart' and Vogt's article 'Ein Blick auf das jetzige Genf. —169 
191 This seems to refer to the negotiations on the publication of Marx's Herr Vogt, 
which originally was to appear in Meissner's publishing house in Hamburg.— 
169 
192 A dictum traceable to Jean Stanislas Andrieux's short story 'Le meunier de 
Sans-Souci', which is based on the tradition about a miller who won a suit in a 
Berlin court against King Frederick II over his mill, which was to be pulled 
down to make room for the Sanssouci palace.—170, 176 
193 An ironic allusion to the book Kraft und Stoff (Energy and Matter) (1855) by 
the German physiologist Ludwig Büchner, a vulgar materialist like Vogt. —171 
194 Garibaldi's letter to Green, written in the summer of 1860, was used by Marx in 
his article 'Interesting from Sicily.—Garibaldi's Quarrel with La Farina.—A 
Letter from Garibaldi' (see present edition, Vol. 17).—171 
195 On the reform of the Prussian army see Note 19.—172 
196 xhis refers to an episode of the 1859-60 Italian revolution (see Note 165), the 
expulsion from Sicily of Giuseppe La Farina, an emissary of Cavour's, in July 
1860.  For details see Marx's article 'Interesting from Sicily.—Garibaldi's 
Quarrel with La Farina.—A Letter from Garibaldi' (present edition, Vol. 17).— 
172 
197 An allusion to the fact that Napoleon Ill's negotiations with Prince Regent 
William of Prussia in Baden-Baden (see Note 183) could involve a betrayal of 
Austria's interests, just as the treaty concluded by Napoleon III with Francis 
Joseph in Villafranca in July 1859 (see Note 161) involved a betrayal of Italy's 
interests. In the course of the latter talks Napoleon III proposed leaving 
Lombardy to Austria in exchange for an Austrian undertaking to maintain 
neutrality in the event of France's attempting to seize the German territories on 
the left bank of the Rhine. Kinglake touched on the matter in the House of 
Commons speech mentioned by Engels. See also Marx's Herr Vogt, present 
edition, Vol. 17, p. 172.—173

'The History of the Rifle', which appeared in eight instalments in the Volunteer 
Journal, for Lancashire and Cheshire between 3 November 1860 and 19 January 
1861 (see present edition, Vol. 18).—177 
202 Weber's letter had reached Marx as early as 29 July but it was not until 
2 August, when Marx got the money for the payment of Weber's fee and the 
legal costs from Engels and Wolff in Manchester, that he was able to answer it 
(see this volume, pp. 175-77).—177 
203 This letter was written in reply to the one from Mrs Marx of 14 August 1860 
(see this volume, p. 568).—179 
204 -pms  refers to the negotiations concerning a publisher for Marx's Herr Vogt. 
Engels' words to the effect that 'it's irresponsible on Moor's part not even to 
answer my questions concerning Siebel', refer to his letter to Marx of 27 June 
(see this volume, pp. 168-69) and, presumably, another letter, which has not 
reached us.—179 
205 The address on the envelope is in Mrs Marx's hand: 'Herrn Justiz-Rath Weber, 
Berlin, 11. Brüderstrasse'. Weber answered Marx on 27 August. He drafted his 
reply on Marx's letter under the signature.—180 
206 Marx means Garibaldi's successful operations, after his landing on the 
mainland on 19 August 1860 (see Note 198), to free Southern Italy from the 
rule of the Neapolitan Bourbons.—182. 185 
207 On 1 September 1860 or thereabouts, Engels wrote the article 'Garibaldi's 
Progress' and a few days later the article 'Garibaldi in Calabria' (see present 
edition, Vol. 17). On Tiirr see Marx's article 'Affairs in Prussia.— Prussia, 
France and Italy' (ibid ;).—182, 184 
208 In late August and early September Marx dealt with these subjects in two 
articles for the New-York Daily Tribune, 'Corn Prices.—European Finances and 
War Preparations.— The Oriental Question' and 'British Commerce' (see 
present edition, Vol. 17).—185 
209 This refers to an article and money sent by Engels. Marx added the line on 
Thursday, 2 September.—185

211 In September 1860, the press announced the forthcoming meeting of the 
Emperors of Russia and Austria and the Prince Regent of Prussia. It was held 
in Warsaw in October. See also Marx's article 'Russia Using Austria.—The 
Meeting at Warsaw' (present edition, Vol. 17).—189 
212 This refers to the uprising in Rhenish Prussia, the Bavarian Palatinate and 
Baden in the spring and summer of 1849 in support of the Imperial 
Constitution adopted by the Frankfurt National Assembly. Despite its limita­
tions,  the Constitution was seen by the people as the only surviving gain of the 
revolution. The volunteer corps commanded by August Willich, was the 
staunchest unit in the insurgent army. Engels was Willich's adjutant.—191

Freiligrath about the financial position of the General Bank of Switzerland. 
Freiligrath was an employee of its London branch.—192 
215 In his letter of 11 September 1860 Lassalle told Marx that Bürgers had urged 
Prussian hegemony in a speech before the National Association in Coburg. — 
194 
216 Marx wrote this note on the top of the first page of the letter by Freiligrath to 
him of 15 September 1860 answering Marx's enquiry, made at Lassalle's 
request, about the financial position of the General Bank of Switzerland (see 
Note 214).—195 
217 This refers to Engels' stay with Marx in May 1860 (see Note 166).—196 
218 The New American Cyclopaedia was a sixteen-volume reference work prepared 
by a group of progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers on the New-York 
Daily Tribune editorial board (Charles Dana, George Ripley and others). It 
appeared between 1858 and 1863 and was reprinted unchanged in 1868-69. A 
number of eminent US and European scholars wrote for it. 
Notwithstanding the editors' express condition that articles should be 
non-partisan in character, those of Marx and Engels reflect their revolutionary 
proletarian, materialist views. 
Marx and Engels contributed to the Cyclopaedia from July 1857 to 
November 1860. Their articles for it have been included in Vol. 18 of the 
present edition.—196 
219 Marx discussed this in more detail in the article 'Affairs in Prussia.— Prussia, 
France and Italy' (present edition, Vol. 17).—196 
220 Engels wrote the article on 22 November 1860 or thereabouts (see present edition, 
Vol. 18).—198 
221 Despite the victorious advance of Garibaldi's army (see notes 165 and 198), in 
September 1860 the peasants began to dissociate themselves from the 
revolution because the propertied classes were sabotaging Garibaldi's pro-
peasant decrees. The initiative passed to the Piedmont government, which sent 
its troops to the Papal States. 
Lamoriciere commanded the Papal troops at the time.—199 
222 xhe Quirinal—one of the seven hills on which Rome is situated. Engels alludes 
to Garibaldi's appeal of 10 September 1860 stating his intention to advance on 
Rome and, upon completing the unification of the country, to proclaim Victor 
Emmanuel King of Italy from the Quirinal.—200 
223 After bringing about the collapse of the Roman Republic in 1849, the French 
interventionist troops stayed in Rome until 1870.— 200 
224 Otto Wigand was a publisher in Leipzig. Marx obviously means Wigand's letter 
of 20 March 1852 stating his refusal to bring out The Eighteenth Brumaire of 
Louis Bonaparte on account of 'the risks vis-à-vis the state this involves'.—201 
225 An allusion to the fact that Edwin James, who went to see Garibaldi in Italy in 
the autumn of 1860, had been datelining his reports in The Times from a 
different city each time.—203 
226 Engels' article, published in The Volunteer Journal, for Lancashire and Cheshire,

228 On 1 October 1860 at Volturno, Garibaldi's forces defeated the army of 
Francis II, King of the Two Sicilies, thereby completing, by and large, the 
liberation of Southern Italy.—205, 207 
229 xhere  is no  evidence  to support these data  on  Garibaldi's background.—206 
230 xhis apparently refers  to a  statement  by  Szemere  on  Emperor Francis Joseph's 
diploma  of 20  October  1860  granting  a modicum  of  autonomy  to the 
non-German parts  of the  Austrian Empire. Szemere's statement  has not  been 
found (see also Marx's Herr Vogt, present edition, Vol.  17, p.  225).—210,  215 
2,1 This refers to the 1860 US Presidential election, which was contested by the 
Republican and the Democratic Party. The Republican Party was formed in 
1854,  on the basis of a broad coalition embracing the industrial and commercial 
bourgeoisie, farmers, workers and craftsmen in the North-eastern states. Its 
establishment as a force opposed to the Democratic Party reflected the 
antagonisms between the rapidly developing capitalism of the North and the 
system of slave labour in the South. The Republican Party, controlled by the 
Northern bourgeoisie, favoured the restriction of slavery to the southern states, 
the free settlement of the West, and protective tariffs to promote the 
development of national industry. On 7 November 1860 the Republican 
candidate, Abraham Lincoln, was elected President.—210 
232 This letter by Engels has not been found.—211, 238, 240, 253, 257, 300, 309, 
333, 334, 466, 482 
233 Marx  means Lommel's statement  of 5  April  1860  exposing Vogt's  pro-
Bonapartist activities. Lommel enclosed  it in his  letter  to  Marx  of 13  April 
1860,  upon learning that  the  statement would  not be  published  in the 
Allgemeine Zeitung. Marx quotes  an  extract from that letter  in Herr Vogt  (see 
present edition,  Vol. 17, p.  71).—211 
234 Marx means his letter of 13 November. Engels' letter in question, presumably 
of the same date, has not been found.— 213 
235 xhis refers  to the  comment  of the  Manchester Guardian's Paris correspondent,  in 
its issue  of 12  November 1860, that 'Louis-Napoleon spends  his  gold  in vain  in 
supporting such newspapers  as the  National-Zeitung'  (see  present edition, 
Vol. 17, p.  326).—213 
236 By tne  Kossuth-Cobden memorandum Marx evidently means the summary, 
sent to him by Szemere, of a conversation that Kossuth had had with British 
MP William Sandford on 30 May 1854. Szemere's source had been a letter 
from Richard Cobden, leader of the English Free Traders. An excerpt from 
the memorandum bearing on Hungary's relations with Austria and Russia was 
quoted by Marx in Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 328).— 215

This article, as well as the one Marx received on 12 December, was written by 
Engels at Marx's request (see this volume, pp. 220 and 222). It is not known 
whether the New-York Daily Tribune published it.—  223,  226 
In late January 1861 Engels wrote the article 'French Armaments'. Originally 
intended for the New-York Daily Tribune, it was revised by the author for The 
Volunteer Journal, for Lancashire and Cheshire, in which it appeared on 
2 February 1861, No. 22 (see present edition, Vol. 18).—224 
Marx means Edouard Simon's article 'Le procès de M. Vogt avec la Gazette 
d'Augsbourg', published in Revue contemporaine of 15 February 1860. In it 
Simon used various turns of phrase from Techow's letter (see Note  56).—  225 
Here and further in the text the reference is to advertisements announcing the 
publication of Marx's Herr  Vogt.—  227 
This refers to Marx's private library which he had collected in the 1840s and 
left in the safekeeping of his friend, Communist League member Roland 
Daniels, in Cologne in May 1849, when expelled by the Prussian authorities. 
Shortly before being arrested in 1851, Daniels hid the books in the warehouse 
of his brother, a wine merchant. Acquitted at the Cologne Communist trial in 
late 1852, he came out of prison a gravely sick man. He died of tuberculosis in 
August 1855. At the beginning of 1856 Daniels' widow took steps to send the 
books to Marx, but owing to the high transportation costs and other problems, 
it was not until December 1860 that he received his library, with some books 
missing. 
A list of the books of this library, compiled by Daniels and with notes by 
Marx, has been preserved.—228, 239, 255, 265 
Marx evidently means the articles by Engels whose receipt he acknowledged in 
his letters of 5 and 12 December 1860 (see Note 240).—230 
The Crystal Palace in London was built of metal and glass to house the Great 
Exhibition of 1851.—236 
The London publisher Albert Petsch was to distribute the unsold part of the 
Boston edition of Marx's Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne 
(1853).  Several copies of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, 
published in New York in 1852, were likewise turned over to Petsch for sale. 
The two works are in Vol. 11 of the present edition.—238, 327 
This refers to Eduard Meyen's libellous article 'Die neue Denunciation Karl 
Vogt's durch K. Marx' in the Freischütz, Nos. 155 and 156, 27 and 29 De­
cember 1860, and No. 1, 1 January 1861.—238, 239, 241, 242

acquitted, he was forced to resign in November of that year.—241 
251 In January 1861, the Prussian Crown passed to William I, who from 1858 to 
1861 had been Regent during the reign of Frederick William IV.—241 
252 xhe late 1850s saw a rise in the national liberation struggle of the peoples of 
the Austrian Empire and, as a result, an inner political crisis. In an attempt to 
contain the revolutionary and democratic forces, the government of Francis 
Joseph made a number of half-hearted concessions to the national liberation 
movement late in 1860. See Engels' article 'Austria—Progress of the 
Revolution' (present edition, Vol.  17).—  241 
253 The  victory of the Republican Party at the 1860 election (see Note 231) gave 
the capitalist North of the USA a stronger position vis-à-vis the Southern 
slaveowners, who had dominated the Federal organs of power for a long time. 
Lincoln's election to the Presidency was taken by the Southern states as a 
pretext for secession. South Carolina was the first to quit the Union. It was 
followed by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Florida. See 
Marx's article 'The American Question in England' (present edition, Vol. 19).—

258 The Manchester School—a trend in economic thinking which reflected the 
interests of the industrial bourgeoisie. Its supporters, known as Free Traders, 
advocated removal of protective tariffs and non-intervention by the govern­
ment in economic life. The centre of the Free Traders' agitation was 
Manchester, where the movement was headed by two textile manufacturers, 
Richard Cobden and John Bright, who founded the Anti-Corn Law League in 
1838.  In the 1840s and 1850s the Free Traders were à separate political group, 
which later formed the Left wing of the Liberal Party.— 246

261 In mid-January 1861 Rodbertus, Berg and Bûcher published a statement on 
the unification of Germany (Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 13, 13 January, supple­
ment; Der Beobachter,  Nos. 17, 18 and 19; 20, 22 and 23 January). They argued 
that, together with Prussia, the future Germany should include Schleswig-
Holstein and Austria so as to have access both to the North Sea and—via Austria's 
possessions in Italy—to the Mediterranean. They advocated a 'Great Germany' 
and held that the country should be unified through the consolidation of the 
German Confederation.—249, 253 
262 An allusion to the negotiations held in Warsaw in October 1860 (see 
Note 211).—250 
263 xhis presumably refers to the petition drawn up by Lassalle for Countess 
Sophie von Hatzfeldt in connection with her divorce case, completed in 1854 
(Klage der Gräfin Hatzfeldt wegen ungesetzlicher Vermögensaneignung [Complaint 
by Countess Hatzfeldt about Unlawful Appropriation of Property]). The 
petition was submitted to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies at the beginning of 
1861.  Appended to it was a memorandum to the Ministry which contained a 
sharp critique of Prussia's reactionary regime.—251, 252, 254 
264 In this note Marx presumably informed Eichhoff of his intention to translate 
into English the latter's pamphlet Berliner Polizei-Silhouetten, which appeared in 
1860,  and have it published, whole or abridged, and probably with his own 
commentaries, in The Times. In his letter of 16 February 1861, Eichhoff agreed 
to the project, but Marx was unable to carry it out.—251 
265 On 21 March 1857 Marx received a letter from Charles Dana, editor of the 
New-York Daily Tribune, informing him that in view of the economic recession 
only one of his articles a week would be paid, whether published or not, while 
the others would only be paid if published. In October of the same year, Dana 
informed Marx that, for the same reasons, the Tribune had discharged all its 
correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and was requesting 
Marx to confine himself to one article a week.—  252,  570 
266 I.e., supporters of the German National Association (see Note 24).—253 
267 xhis may refer to Engels' letter to Marx of 31 January 1861, or to some other 
letter, which has not been found.—254 
268 Engels means his article 'French Armaments', which he wrote at Marx's request 
in late January 1861 (see this volume, p. 250). He revised it for The Volunteer 
Journal since, after Dana's letter (see Note 265), he had good cause to fear that 
the New-York Daily Tribune would not publish it.—257 
269 xhis refers to the pamphlet, F. Engels, Essays Addressed to Volunteers, 
London-Manchester, 1861. It included five articles published in The Volunteer 
Journal in 1860 and early 1861: 'A Review of English Volunteer Riflemen', 
'The French Light Infantry', 'Volunteer Artillery', 'The History of the Rifle', 
and 'Volunteer Engineers: Their Value and Sphere of Action' (all five will be 
found in Vol. 18 of the present edition). The pamphlet appeared on 16 March 
1861.—258,  262 
270 After the death of Engels' father in March 186U, his brothers proposed that he 
should renounce his title to the family concern in Engelskirchen in their 
favour. One of their arguments was that he had lived abroad since 1849. By 
way of compensation, he was to receive £10,000 to consolidate his legal and 
financial standing with the Ermen & Engels firm in Manchester, of which

Engels hoped eventually to become a co-owner. His brothers' proposal 
infringed Engels' rights, since under English law the transfer of a deceased 
co-owner's title was highly complicated and problematic. Engels had lengthy 
talks with Gottfried Ermen on the terms of his continued collaboration with the 
firm (see this volume, pp. 134-35). It was not until 25 September 1862 that a 
contract was signed providing for Engels' eventual partnership. He became a 
co-owner in 1864 (see this volume, p. 548).—259, 548 
271 Kinkel started out in life as a pastor's assistant in the Protestant community in 
Cologne.—262 
272 During the siege of Gaeta (see Note 259), French warships kept the fortress 
supplied with provisions and ammunition. They left the Gaeta roadstead on 
19 January 1861.—262 
273 In January 1859 an anti-feudal uprising by Maronite peasants (the Maronites 
are a Christian sect recognising the authority of the Pope but retaining the 
ancient rites of the Eastern Church) erupted in Northern Lebanon. It spread to 
central Lebanon and, in the spring of 1860, led to bloody clashes between 
Maronites and Druses (a Moslem sect). The religious strife was fanned by 
British and French emissaries and the Turkish authorities. Napoleon III 
exploited the disturbances as a pretext for sending an expeditionary corps to 
Lebanon in August 1860. Pressure from Britain, Russia and Austria forced 
France to withdraw its troops the following year. For details see Marx's article 
'Events in Syria.—Session of the British Parliament.—The State of British 
Commerce' (present edition, Vol. 17).—262 
274 Heineke the lusty knave is the hero of the German folk song Heineke, der starke 
Knecht, a parody of 16th-century grobian literature. In his work 'Moralising

Heinzen's journalistic writings with samples of grobian literature.—263

278 Marx stayed at Lion Philips' in Zalt-Bommel, Holland, from 28 February to 
16 March 1861. Thence he went to Berlin, where he stayed until 12 April. 
During that visit to Germany, he also went to Elberfeld, Barmen, Cologne and 
Trier. He returned to London on 29 April.—266, 299, 574, 577, 579 
279 Following an abortive coup by petty-bourgeois democrats on 13 June 1849, a 
state of siege was proclaimed in Paris, bringing in its wake reprisals against 
democrats and socialists. On 19 July, the French authorities notified Marx that 
he was being expelled from Paris to Morbihan, a marshy and insalubrious 
region in Brittany. Rather than go there, Marx decided to emigrate to England 
and settle in London. He left Paris on 24 August.—268

280 Expelled from France by the Guizot government, Marx moved to Brussels on 3 
February 1845. However, in December of that year the Prussian government, 
taking advantage of Marx's coming under its jurisdiction as a Prussian subject, 
demanded his expulsion from Belgium. As a result, Marx was forced to 
relinquish Prussian nationality. For details see the article 'The Conflict between 
Marx and Prussian Citizenship' and 'Marx's Statement on the Rejection of His 
Application for Restoration of His Prussian Citizenship' (present edition, Vol. 7, 
pp. 407-10, and Vol. 19, pp. 345-52).—268 
281 The Preliminary Parliament, or Preparliament met in Frankfurt am Main from 31 
March to 4 April 1848. A council of representatives of the German states, it set 
up a Committee of Fifty to prepare the ground for the convocation of an 
all-German National Assembly (see Note 282) and produced a draft of the 
'Fundamental Rights and Demands of the German People'.— 268 
282 xhe Frankfurt Parliament, or the German National Assembly, opened in 
Frankfurt am Main on 18 May 1848. It was convened to unify the country and 
draw up a Constitution. The liberal deputies, who were in the majority, turned 
the Assembly into a mere debating club. At the decisive moments of the 
revolution, the liberals condoned the reactionary policy of the counter­
revolutionary forces. In spring 1849, the liberals walked out of the Assembly 
after the Prussian and other governments had rejected the Imperial 
Constitution it had drawn up. The Rump of the Assembly moved to Stuttgart, 
and was dispersed by the Württemberg forces on 18 June 1849 (see Note 
154).—268 
283 waradje  (from the Dutch word waaràtje, truly, indeed) is the favourite word of

Philips' future husband.—274

285 In 1861 the conflict between the capitalist North and the slaveowning South of 
the USA (see Note 253) assumed the form of armed struggle. On 12 April 
rebel Southern troops bombarded Fort Sumter (South Carolina) thus unleash­
ing a civil war that lasted until 1865. After the outbreak of the rebellion, four 
more states—Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee—seceded 
from the Union. For details see this volume, pp. 294-309 and Marx's articles

in Montgomery, Alabama, on 4 February 1861. Attended by representatives of 
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, it 
proclaimed the establishment of the Southern Confederacy, adopted a 
Constitution and formed a government. On 18 February, Jefferson Davis was 
elected President of the Confederate States.—278, 301, 306

288 it  was  not  until September 1861 that Marx agreed to contribute to the Austrian 
liberal newspaper Die  Presse,  of which the German journalist Max Friedländer 
was an associate editor. Marx gave his consent after having made sure that, in 
the domestic sphere, Die Presse was opposing the reactionary forces and was 
also critical of the government of Anton von Schmerling, a liberal.—279 
289 'frie reference is to General Pfuel's part in the suppression of the national 
liberation uprising in Posen, a duchy under Prussian rule, in the spring of 
1848.  On his orders the heads of the insurgents taken prisoner were shaved 
and their hands and ears branded with lunar caustic (in German Höllenstein, i.e. 
stone of hell). Hence his nickname, 'von Höllenstein'. —280 
290 xhjs  refers to the 1860 military reform in Prussia (see Note 19) and the bill on 
the taxation of the estates of the higher nobility submitted to the Prussian Diet 
thai vear. Initially turned down bv the Upper House, trie bill was passed in May 
1861. 
The debates over the reorganisation of the Prussian army gave rise, in the 
early 1860s, to a Constitutional conflict between the government and the liberal 
bourgeois majority in the Diet. The conflict stimulated the popular movement. 
Clashes with police and troops became more frequent. The Constitutional 
conflict was not resolved until 1866, when, under the impact of Prussia's victory 
over Austria, the Prussian bourgeoisie knuckled down before the government 
and endorsed its entire previous record.—280 
'-91 Agreers Assembly (Vereinbarlingsversammlung) was Marx's ironic way of 
referring to the Prussian National Assembly, which met in May 1848. 
Convoked to draw up a Constitution, it sought to do this not on the basis of its 
sovereign and constituent rights but 'by agreement with the Crown' (the 
principle formulated by the Camphausen-Hansemann government and adopted 
by the majority of the Assembly). The Crown used the agreement principle as a 
screen for preparing a coup d'état. On 5 December 1848, the Prussian National 
Assembly was disbanded.—281 
292 During his stay in Berlin in the spring of 1861 (see Note 278) Marx took a 
series of steps to have his Prussian citizenship restored. The Berlin Police 
Presidium turned down his application, based on the Supreme decree on 
amnesty, for the lights of a Prussian subject, and suggested that he should 
rather seek to be naturalised in Prussia. However, his application to this effect 
was refused by the Berlin Police President, von Zedlitz, in June 1861, and by 
Prussia's Minister of the Interior, Schwerin, in November (see present edition, 
Vol. 19).—282, 305, 579 
293 jn March 1861, Blanqui, who had returned to France after the amnesty of 
1859,  was arrested on charges of organising a secret society. On 14 June, he 
was sentenced to four years in prison, despite the absence of incriminating 
evidence.—284, 318 
294 Marx met Simon Bernard cm Saturday, 11 May 1861. As follows from 
Bernard's letter to Marx of 13 May, Marx told Bernard during their 
conversation that Sophie von Hatzfeldt was willing to lend a sum of money to 
organise Blanqui's escape. Thanks to Marx's efforts and the campaign he had

launched, articles in defence of Blanqui appeared in the German, Italian and 
American progressive press (see also Note 309).—284 
295 This refers to the proceedings instituted on behalf of the Emperor of Austria 
against Kossuth and Messrs Day and Sons who had manufactured a large 
amount of Hungarian paper money in England. Applying to the English court, 
the Austrian government demanded an end to such actions and the destruction of 
the banknotes produced. On 27 February 1861, the Vice-Chancellor's Court 
granted the justice of this demand. On 12 June, the Court of Chancery turned 
down the defendants' appeal and confirmed the initial ruling.—284 
296 In September 1860, British Army Captain MacDonald, travelling in Germany, 
was arrested in Bonn on charges of disobeying the local authorities. He was 
kept in detention for six days, brought before a court and fined. The British 
government took advantage of the incident to whip up an anti-Prussia 
propaganda campaign. It was not until May 1861 that the conflict was 
resolved.—284, 354 
297 This refers to the Parliamentary debate in March 1861 on Alexander Dunlop's 
proposal for setting up a commission of inquiry into the falsification of 
diplomatic documents in 1839 by the British Foreign Office, then headed by 
Palmerston. In 1839 the British Parliament issued a Blue Book on Persia and 
Afghanistan (Correspondence relating to Persia and Afghanistan) containing, 
among other documents, a number of letters by A. Burnes, the British 
representative in Kabul, on the Anglo-Afghan war (1838-42). The letters had 
been selected and presented by the Foreign Office in such a way as to conceal 
Britain's provocative role in unleashing the war. Shortly before his death 
Burnes sent duplicates of his letters to London. Those not included in the Blue 
Book were published by his family (A. Burnes, Cabool, Being a Personal 
Narrative of a Journey to and Residence in That City, in the Years 1836, 7 and 8..., 
London, 1842; J. Burnes, Notes on His Name and Family (Including a Memoir of 
Sir Alexander Burnes), Edinburgh, 1851). On 19 March 1861 Palmerston, 
speaking in the House of Commons, refused to discuss the matter as too far 
back in time and irrelevant. See Marx's article 'The London Times and Lord 
Palmerston' (present edition, Vol. 19).—286, 517 
-9S An ironic reference to Lassalle's book Das System der erworbenen  Rechte; Dharma 
is a concept of Indian, particularly Buddhist, religion and philosophy. In religion, 
it denotes God, the Absolute. In philosophy, it stands for religion, morality, 
justice, law and order. In Buddhist literature it signifies, above all, Buddha's

299 fhis refers to the Left wing of the Prussian National Assembly (see Note 291), 
which consisted of bourgeois radicals and liberals.— 287 
300 jn  November and early December 1848 Prussia witnessed a coup d'état which 
culminated in the establishment of the arch-reactionary Brandenburg-
Manteuffel Ministry and the dissolution of the National Assembly.—287 
301 Marx means the Prussian National Assembly (see Note 291), one of whose 
sittings he attended somewhere between 7 and 10 September, during his trip to 
Berlin and Vienna in late August and early September 1848 with a view to 
strengthening ties with democratic and workers' organisations.— 288 
302 Thg reference is to the Upper and Lower Chambers of the Prussian Diet.— 
288 

=====第659页=====
Notes 623 
303 When the coup d'état was being plotted and carried out in Prussia (see Note 
300),  the Frankfurt National Assembly undertook to settle the conflict between 
the Prussian National Assembly and the Crown. With this aim in view, first 
Bassermann (a liberal) and later Simson and Hergenhahn arrived in Berlin as 
imperial commissioners. Their mediation benefited the counter-revolutionary 
forces because it diverted the democrats in Germany from giving effective 
support to the Prussian National Assembly in its struggle against the 
Brandenburg-Manteuffel Ministry. 
Marx ironically compares Simson to Samson, the Old Testament hero, who 
slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass (Judges, 15:15).—288 
304 Marx means the description of Vincke he gave in his Herr Vogt (present

306 -pne  Elberfeld uprising of workers and petty bourgeoisie broke out on 8 May 
1849 and served as a signal for armed struggle in a number of cities in the 
Rhine Province in defence of the Imperial Constitution. The immediate 
occasion of the uprising was the attempt of the Prussian government to 
suppress the revolutionary movement on the Rhine by armed force, destroy the 
democratic organisations and the press, and disarm the army units which 
disobeyed its orders and supported the Imperial Constitution. Engels played an 
active part in the uprising. At a trial held in April and May 1850, most of the 
participants in the Elberfeld uprising were found guilty and sentenced to 
various terms of imprisonment. See Engels' article 'Elberfeld', (present edition, 
Vol. 9). 
In June and July 1849, Engels was fighting in the ranks of the 
Baden-Palatinate insurgent army (see Note 212).—290

309 This letter to Sophie von Hatzfeldt has not been found. As can be seen from 
Hatzfeldt's reply, dated 14 June 1861, Marx had requested her assistance in 
drawing public attention to the harsh treatment of Blanqui in prison, and asked 
for money to finance the printing of a pamphlet by Louis Watteau on Blanqui's 
trial (see Note 293 and p. 295 in this volume). Marx also suggested organising 
meetings and the publication of a series of articles in Germany in connection 
with the trial. A number of articles on Blanqui appeared in the German and 
Italian press with the help of the German writer Ludmilla Assing.—291 
310 This refers to Marx's work on the second instalment of A Contribution to the 
Critique of Political Economy, which he started on completing his polemic writing, 
Herr Vogt (see Note 38). In the period 1861 to 1863 he produced a vast 
manuscript (200 sheets of print), the second rough draft of Capital—292, 315,

311 In May 1861, in connection with the outbreak of the Civil War in the United 
States, the Federal Government offered Garibaldi a commanding post in the 
army of the North. The offer was made through the US Minister to Brussels, 
who went to see Garibaldi on Caprera Island. Garibaldi replied with a letter 
i expressing warm sympathy for the Unionists, but refused to accept the post in

issue. He said he would be willing to fight on the side of the Northerners if it 
was to become a war to end slavery.—293 
3,2 Yankees was the nickname given by British soldiers to residents of New England 
in the eighteenth century. During and after the Civil War (1861-65) it was used 
to denote the Northerners.—293, 325, 368, 400, 416, 562 
313 This letter has not been found.—293 
314 The end of this letter has not been found. The available part was first 
published in English in: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, The Civil War in the 
United States, New York, 1937.—294 
315 In the four months between Lincoln's election and his inauguration (on 4 
March 1861) the pro-Southern faction in Buchanan's Administration (Secretary 
of War Floyd, Secretary of the Treasury Cobb and others) used their powers to 
strengthen the South and prepare the ground for civil war. Troops loyal to the 
Union were transferred from the South to the Far West and dispersed to 
different garrisons. Arms and ammunition were shipped to the South and large 
sums of money sent there. Even before the outbreak of hostilities representa­
tives of the slaveholders, with the connivance of the government, opened 
negotiations with Britain to obtain financial and military aid (on this see also 
p. 307).—295 
3,6 In May 1861 four volunteer regiments, consisting mostly of German 
immigrants, were formed in St. Louis, Missouri. They encircled the Secession­
ists' military camp outside the city and forced them to surrender, thus 
preventing them from seizing the arsenal and coming out against the Union 
arms in hand.— 296 
3 '7 This refers to the slave states bordering on the North which refused to join the 
Confederacy: Delaware, Missouri, Maryland and, later, Kentucky. For details 
see Marx's article 'The Civil War in the United States' (present edition, 
Vol. 19). 
On the border states see p. 277.— 296 
318 Marx means Zerffi's Kinkel-inspired articles in defence of MacDonald 
published in the English press (see Note 296). This aroused acute discontent 
within the National Association and caused a split in its London branch.—297, 
301 
319 South Kensington Museum (now Victoria and Albert Museum) included a museum 
of ornamental and applied art, a national gallery of British art, an art library 
and a royal college of art.— 297 
320 This refers to the reviews Gatherings from the Press', which were directed 
against Kinkel's newspaper Hermann. They appeared in June and July 1859 in 
the weekly Das Volk, in whose publication Marx took a direct part (see present 
edition, Vol. 16).—298

322 In connection with Blanqui's prosecution (see Note 293) a correspondence 
developed between Marx and Blanqui's friend Watteau (Denonville) on how to 
launch a campaign in Blanqui's defence (see notes 294 and 309). In a letter to 
Watteau of 18 May 1861, which has not been found, Marx presumably offered

help on behalf of German communists. In his reply (8 June) Watteau wrote 
that he had shown Marx's letter to Blanqui, who 'was deeply moved by the 
German proletarians' sympathy'. In the same letter Watteau requested Marx's 
aid in publishing a pamphlet on Blanqui's prosecution which exposed the 
unseemly methods of the Bonapartist police and judiciary. As follows from 
the correspondence between Blanqui and Watteau, and frorn Marx's letter to 
Watteau of 10 November 1861 (see this volume, p. 326), Marx sent the latter 
money for the publication of the pamphlet and took part in discussing plans 
for freeing Blanqui from detention. He informed Sophie von Hatzfeldt of 
these plans, and she agreed to provide money for the purpose.—298 
323 The Mexican War (1846-48) was caused by the expansionist designs of the US 
slaveholding planters and big bourgeoisie. As a result of the war, the USA 
seized nearly half of Mexico's territory, including Texas, Upper California, 
New Mexico and other areas.—299 
324 "fhe Schleswig-Holstein question was prominent in nineteenth-century Euro­
pean diplomacy. The Congress of Vienna (1815) recognised the duchies of 
Schleswig and Holstein to be possessions of Denmark in personal union with 
the Danish King. At the same time, Holstein was declared a member of the 
German Confederation. During the 1848-49 revolution, an anti-Danish national 
liberation movement developed in the duchies which was, however, defeated. 
At a conference in London attended by representatives of Austria, Britain, 
Denmark, France, Russia and Sweden, a protocol on the Danish succession was 
signed on 2 August 1850 which proclaimed the indivisibility of the Danish 
Crown possessions, including the two duchies. This document formed the basis 
for the London Protocol of 8 May 1852 on the integrity of the Danish 
monarchy (see Note 380). 
Denmark's attempts to fully subject the duchies aggravated Danish-Prussian 
relations and were exploited as a pretext for intervention by Prussia, which 
regarded the reunification of Schleswig and Holstein with Germany as the first 
step towards the union of Germany under Prussia's aegis.—299, 496, 501 
325 In her letter of 14 June 1861 Sophie von Hatzfeldt touched on the possibility 
of Engels' return to Germany following the amnesty proclaimed in Prussia (see 
this volume, pp. 247-49) and in this connection wrote that Ludwig Simon had been 
officially notified that he would only be allowed to return to Prussia if he 
petitioned the King for a pardon.— 299 
326 An allusion to Engels' participation in the Elberfeld and Baden-Palatinate 
uprisings (see Note 306).— 299 
327 A gibe at the vulgar economists who maintained that profit was merely an extra 
charge on the consumer over and above the price. Marx attacks this view in his 
economic manuscript of 1861-63 and in Volume III of Capital (present edition, 
vols.  32 and 37).—300 
328 Marx means the abortive attempt of Unionist troops under General Francis 
Edwin Pierce to capture the Confederates' fortifications at Big Bethel near Fort 
Monroe, Virginia, in the small hours of 10 June 1861. One Unionist column 
opened fire on another by mistake. Later the Confederates compelled the 
Unionists to retreat in disarray.—  300,  304 
329 This refers to the victory of the Northerners, commanded by N. P. Lyon, over 
the Missouri pro-Secessionist militia led by Governor Jackson at Boonville on 17 
June.—300

330 Marx means the victory of the Republican Party in the 1860 elections (see Note 
231).—301 
831 Marx means the armed struggle in Kansas in 1854-56 between supporters and 
opponents of slavery (the latter were mostly farmers). It began after the adoption, 
in May 1854, of An Act to organize the Territories of  Nebraska  and Kansas, which let 
the population of the two Territories decide for themselves whether they wanted 
slavery or not. Despite a series of successes by the anti-slavery forces, Kansas fell to 
the slavery party, who had received armed support from the Federal government. 
However, most of the population continued the struggle and in 1861 won the 
admission of Kansas to the Union as a free state. The struggle in Kansas was, in 
effect, the prelude to the US Civil War. 
The Border Ruffians were gangs of pro-slavery thugs brought into Kansas 
from Missouri during the Kansas war.—301 
332 At the Battle of Waterloo, on 18 June 1815, the Anglo-Dutch and Prussian 
forces, commanded by the Duke of Wellington and Blücher, defeated 
Napoleon's army.—301 
333 ßy tne German communist association and the Frenchmen's associations Marx 
means the German Workers' Educational Society (see Note 3) and the 
numerous French refugee societies in London. 
The June insurrection—the uprising of the Paris proletariat of 23-26 June 
1848.—302 
334 General Winfield Scott's strategy, later known as the Anaconda Plan, called for 
the encirclement of the rebel states by the Federal Army and Navy and the 
gradual contraction of the ring until the rebellion was crushed.— 304 
335 jn  vjew 0f the amnesty of 12 January 1861 (see Note 256) Wilhelm  Wolff,  in 
the summer of 1861, applied to the Prussian Embassy in London for a passport 
to visit Wiesbaden.—304 
336 Marx cites these facts from Lassalle's letter of 1 July 1861.—305, 313 
337 The Border Slave State Convention, or Washington Peace Conference, was held in 
February 1861, on Virginia's initiative. Attended by 21 states, with the border 
states playing the most active part, it was a last, unsuccessful, attempt to resolve 
peacefully the dispute between the Secessionists and the Union.—306 
338 Marx means elections to the US Congress. An extraordinary session of it 
opened on 4 July  1861.—  306 
339 Gulf States—the states lying along the Gulf of Mexico (Florida, Alabama, 
Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas). They formed the core of the Secessionist 
Confederacy.—306, 349 
340 An allusion to Louis Bonaparte's counter-revolutionary coup d'état in France 
on 2 December 1851.—307 
341 The 'poor whites'—the landless free population of the Southern slave states. On 
their part in the Civil War see Marx's article 'The North American Civil War' 
(present edition, Vol. 19). 
Zouaves was the name given to French infantry regiments raised in Algeria 
from the Berber tribe of Zouaves.—307

London from May to November 1862.—310, 353, 364, 365, 380, 384, 408, 414 
345 When Prince William of Prussia (King of Prussia from 1861) assumed the 
regency in October 1858, he dismissed the Manteuffel Ministry and entrusted 
power to moderate liberals. The bourgeois press hailed this 'liberal' course as a 
'New Era'. William's actual aim, however, was to consolidate the monarchv and 
Junkers.—312, 317 
346 On 14 July 1861 student Oskar Becker made an abortive attempt on the life of 
William I, King of Prussia, in Baden-Baden.—  314,  317 
347 In view of the Decree on Amnesty (see Note 256) Engels' relatives were 
exploring the possibility of his return to Germany. In reply the police 
superintendent of Elberfeld stated that Engels had to send in an appropriate 
application and a certificate of loyalty issued by the Prussian Embassy in 
London.—314 
348 A brief extract from this letter was first published in English in: Marx and 
Engels, On Literature and Art, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1976. In less 
abridged form, the letter appeared in The Letters of Karl Marx. Selected and 
Translated with Explanatory Notes and an Introduction by Saul K. Padover, 
Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1979.— 316 
349 This refers to one of the basic aesthetic principles of Classicism, the unity of 
time,  place and action in drama. It was formulated in 1674 by the French 
theorist of Classicism, Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux, in his poem L'art poétique.—

350 A legacy (bequest) in Roman law was a stipulation by the testator in his will 
granting a person a certain right or oiher benefit based on the property 
bequeathed. 
A legatee was one to whom a legacy was bequeathed. As distinct from the 
legatee in this restricted sense, the heir under a will is the universal  legatee,  who 
assumes the liabilities of the deceased as well as his property and rights.— 318 
351 The Gürzenich is a reception building erected in Cologne in 1441-52, in the 
mid-19th century used as a venue for various functions and festivities.— 319 
352 Marx was Engels' guest in Manchester from the end of August to the middle of 
September 1861.—321, 323, 332 
353 Tliis probably refers to the Report of the Thirtieth Meeting of the British 
Association for the Advancement of Science; held at Oxford in June and July 1860, 
London 1861. 
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 
and still exists. It meets annually and publishes reports on these meetings. The 
Association's 31st annual meeting was held in Manchester between 4 and 11 
September 1861. Marx, who was staying with Engels in Manchester at the time, 
attended the sittings of the Economic Science and Statistics Section.—321, 383 
354 Engels went on holiday to Germany on about 3 October 1861 and stayed with 
his family in Barmen till the end of the month.—  322,  375

newspaper's stand on the Cabinet crisis in Austria in the autumn of 1861.—323 
7 An editorial introductory note to Marx's article 'The North American Civil 
War', published in Die  Presse  on 25 October 1861, said: 'We have received from 
London a first communication on the North American Civil War from one of 
the leading German journalists, who knows Anglo-American relations from 
long years of observation. As events on the other side of the ocean develop, we 
shall be in a position to present communications, deriving from the same 
competent pen, which will outline the salient features of the war.'—323 
'8 Marx refers to the chapter 'Bristlers' in his polemic book, Herr Vogt (present 
edition, Vol. 17). 
For Bristlers see this volume, p. 71.—324 
'9 With mass rallies taking place in Warsaw, the Governor-General of the 
Kingdom of Poland, Count Lambert, on 14 October 1861 introduced martial 
law. On the night of 15 October many arrests were made, accompanied by 
clashes between Tsarist troops and members of the population. This was 
followed by the closure of all Catholic churches in Warsaw. 
In referring to the 'exploits of handsome William' Marx means William I's 
speech on the occasion of his coronation in Königsberg on 18 October 1861, in 
which he stressed the divine origin of the sovereignty of the Kings of 
Prussia.—325 
>0 Marx means Engels' holiday in Germany (see Note 354).— 325 
•' This refers to the rifled cannon invented by William Armstrong in 1854 and 
adopted by the British army in 1859. A try-out in the war against China gave 
rise to doubts about its resistance to wear and the convenience of its breech, 
and caused a controversy about its advantages over the Joseph Whitworth gun 
(see also Engels' article 'On Rifled Cannon', instalments III and IV, present 
edition Vol. 17).—325 
,2 This is the only letter of the Marx-Watteau correspondence on the Blanqui case 
to have been found (see Note 322). The French original is in the collection of 
the Blanqui papers at the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris. 
The last paragraph of the letter was first published in Roger Garaudy's 
book, Les sources françaises du socialisme scientifique, Paris, 1948, p. 217. The 
letter was published in full, except for three obliterated words, in Vol. 30 of 
the Second Russian Edition of the Works of Marx and Engels in 1963 and in 
the language of the original in La Pensée, No. 125, Paris, 1966. The three 
obliterated words, since deciphered with the aid of modern technical facilities, 
read tentative de sauvetage and are evidence of Marx's involvement in the plans 
for rescuing Blanqui. The full text of the letter, including these three words, 
was published bv Maurice Paz in La Nouvelle revue socialiste. Politique. Culture, 
No. 20, 1976.

'Soldiers are the only answer to democrats' ('Gegen Demokraten helfen nur 
Soldaten') is a quotation from the poem Die fünfte Zunft by the monarchist 
Wilhelm von Merckel, published as a leaflet in the autumn of 1848. The 
Prussian reactionary writer Karl Gustav von Griesheim took it as the title of his 
pamphlet, published anonymously in Berlin in late November 1848.—328 
36S The reference is to the detention of the British mail steamer Trent by the* 
Unionist warship San Jacinto on 8 November 1861 and the arrest, aboard the 
Trent, of James Murray Mason and John Slidell, Confederate emissaries going

871 Engels means the victory won by the Party of Progress at the elections- to 
Prussia's Chamber of Deputies in November and December 1861. 
The Party of Progress, formed in June 1861, spoke for the German 
bourgeoisie. Its slogans were the unification of Germany under the aegis of 
Prussia, the convocation of an all-German Parliament, and the formation Of a 
strong liberal Ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. Fearing a 
popular revolution, the Party of Progress gave no support to the basic 
democratic: demands — universal suffrage, freedom of the press, freedom of 
association and freedom of assembly.—  331,  501

75 This refers to the Trent incident (see Note 366) which was exploited by the 
textile manufacturers and some members of the Palmerston Cabinet for 
stepping up the anti-Unionist campaign in Britain. Lord Russell demanded the 
release of Mason and Slidell within a week's time on pain of a declaration of 
war by Britain. But other Cabinet members refused to support this line. (See 
Marx's articles 'Controversy over the Trent Case' and 'Progress of Feeling in 
England' and other relevant items in Vol. 19 of the present edition.)—335 
76 Marx means the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, the two highest-
ranking legal officials in Britain. For their decision on the Trent case see Marx's 
articles 'The Anglo-American Conflict', 'The News and Its Effect in London' 
and 'Controversy over the Trent Case' (present edition, Vol. 19).—335 
77 Truly British Minister—an ironic allusion to Lord Palmerston based on a 
passage from Lord Russell's speech in the House of Commons on 20 June 
1850.  Referring to Palmerston he said: '...so long as we continue the 
government of this country, I can answer for my noble Friend that he will act 
not as the Minister of Austria, or as the Minister of Russia, or of France, or of 
any other country, but as the Minister of England'.—336 
78 This refers to the Declaration on the principles of international maritime law 
adopted by the Congress of Paris on 16 April 1856. It banned privateering and 
safeguarded merchantmen of neutral states against attack by belligerent 
powers. The adoption of the Declaration was a diplomatic victory for Russia, 
which from 1780 had opposed Britain's claims to the right to inspect and seize 
the ships of neutral  states.—  336 
79 The reference is to the agreement signed by Russia, Britain and the 
Netherlands in London on 19 May 1815 on defraying Russia's expenses 
incurred in driving out Napoleon's army from the Dutch and Belgian 
provinces. The governments of Britain and the Netherlands undertook to pay 
in compensation part of Russia's debts to the Dutch bankers Hope & Co., and 
the interest on that debt as of 1 January 1816. The agreement stipulated that 
payments would be suspended if the Belgian provinces seceded from the 
Netherlands. After the revolution of 1830, when an independent Belgian state 
was formed, the Netherlands government stopped the payments. On behalf of 
the British government, Palmerston signed a new agreement with Russia on 16 
November 1831 confirming Britain's financial obligations.—337 
80 Under the London Protocol of 8 May 1852 on the integrity of the Danish 
monarchy, signed by Austria, Britain, Denmark, France, Prussia, Russia and 
Sweden, the Emperor of Russia, being a descendant of Duke Charles Peter 
Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp, who had reigned in Russia as Peter III, was one of 
the lawful claimants to the Danish throne, who waived their rights in favour of 
Duke Christian of Glücksburg. This provided an opportunity for the Tsar to 
claim the Danish Crown in the event of the extinction of the Glücksburg 
dynasty.—337, 497, 543 
81 This refers to a meeting held by the Urquhartites on 27 January 1862 in 
connection with the impending Anglo-French intervention against the Union in 
the US Civil War. Marx did not attend.—339 
82 Marx probably means the lecture, he was to give in the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London at Weber's request, expressed in a letter of 10 
December 1861, on the views of the German vulgar economist Wirth and the 
stand advocated by the latter's newspaper, Der Arbeitgeber, which proclaimed 
the community of interests of labour and capital.—339

383 This letter was written in reply to one from Becker of 13 February 1862 
requesting Marx to organise a subscription in London for the publication of 
Becker's book Wie und Wann and offering to translate into French a section in 
Marx's Herr Vogt which had evoked particular interest in Switzerland. Part of 
the present letter was first published in English in: Marx and Engels, Selected 
Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1955.—341 
384 In September 1861 after a six-month interval, Marx resumed for a short time 
his contributions to the New-York Daih Tribune.—  341,  344 
385 Engels means the cotton crisis produced by the interruption in the supply of 
American cotton during the US Civil War (1861-65) as a result of the blockade 
of the southern ports by the Union's navy. The cotton shortage came on the 
eve of, and interlocked with, a production glut.—344, 347, 394, 413 
386 At the time, Engels was hiring lodgings for Mary and Lizzy Burns at 252 Hyde 
Road, Ardwick. He kept his own lodgings at 6 Thorncliffe Grove until 
1864.—344, 427 
387 On 7 March Engels wrote the first part of the article requested by Marx, and 
on 18 March probably the second part (see p. 351). However, the Tribune did 
not publish this article. Engels made use of the first part for his article 'The 
War in America' (see present edition, Vol. 18) published in The Volunteer 
Journal, for Lancashire and Cheshire on 14 March 1862. Marx translated the text 
intended for the Tribune into German, added more recent data and sent the 
text to Die Presse, which published it on 26 and 27 March 1862 (see 'The 
American Civil War', present edition, Vol.  19).—  345,  346 
388 In October 1861 Fremont was dismissed from his post of commander of the 
army in Missouri for issuing a proclamation granting freedom to the slaves of 
rebels. For details see Marx's article 'The Dismissal of Fremont' (present 
edition, Vol. 19).—345 
389 This refers to Russia's abortive attempt in 1861 to establish a naval station on 
Tsushima island off the coast of Japan. Marx must have drawn his data from 
the editorial 'Russian Progress in Asia' in the New-York Daily Tribune, 
No. 6167, 30 January 1862, which gave an inaccurate and tendentious account 
of the affair.— 345 
390 Engels means the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson on the Tennessee and 
the Cumberland by the Federals under Grant in February 1862. For details see 
the article 'The American Civil War' by Marx and Engels (present edition, 
Vol. 19). There are two inaccuracies in Engels' letter here. In the fighting 
referred to, the Southern troops were commanded, not by J. E. Johnston, who 
had won the battle of Bull Run, but by A. S. Johnston. Moreover, the latter 
had not been taken prisoner, as reported in The Times of 5 March 1862, which 
Engels read, but had withdrawn. The Times had given Johnston's name without 
his initials, and this misled Engels. 
The battle fought on the Bull Run river near Manassas, Virginia, on 21 July 
1861 was the first major engagement of the US Civil War. The Federal army

advocated laissez-faire, the lifting of protectionist customs duties, because 
Britain, having completed its industrial revolution and established itself as the 
leading industrial power, could afford to compete freely against other countries 
in the world market.—349 
393 Britain's ruling quarters carefully concealed their pro-Southern stand during 
the war, since public opinion supported the Northerners. On 13 May 1861 the 
government made public Her Majesty's Proclamation of Neutrality which, by 
treating the South as a belligerent, marked the first step towards recognition of 
the Confederacy. It gave the rebels diplomatic, financial and military aid. In 
the Trent incident (see Note 375) it openly sided with the South.— 349 
394 On 17 July 1861 the Mexican Congress suspended all payments on foreign 
debts for two years, which was taken bv Britain, France and Spain as a pretext 
for intervention. To avoid war, the Mexican government, headed by Benito 
Pablo Juarez, reversed the decision in November 1861 and agreed to meet the 
claims of the three powers.— 349

396 xhe battle mentioned by Marx took place on 6 and 7 April 1862. On the 6th, 
the Southern forces, commanded by Beauregard, defeated Grant's army at 
Pittsburg Landing (northeast of Corinth), but on the 7th, following the arrival 
of General Buell's forces, the Northerners counter-attacked and threw the 
Southerners back to Corinth. Engels probably wrote no article on the fighting 
at Corinth, but he gave an analysis of it in his letter to Marx of 5 May 1862 (see 
this volume, pp. 359-60).—353, 359 
397 Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester from 30 March to 25 April 1862.— 
354 
398 while Marx was in Manchester, Engels gave him a bill for £50 to be drawn on 
Borkheim.— 354, 380, 382 
399 Marx is relating the story of the publication of Beta's (Bettziech's) laudatory 
article on Kinkel headed 'Ein Nichtamnestirter'. It appeared in the journal Die 
Gartenlaube, No. 2, 1862, pp. 21-24, and No. 3, pp.  38-41.  Marx got the details 
from a letter by K. W. Eichhoff dated 26 April 1862.—355 
400 A short extract from this letter was first published in English in: Karl Marx, On 
America and the Civil War. Edited and Translated by Saul K. Padover, New

401 In October 1860 Johann Philipp Becker came to Italy with a view to raising a 
Swiss-German volunteer detachment to help Garibaldi. Lassalle, who was going 
to visit Italy, asked Marx for a letter of recommendation to Garibaldi, Mazzini 
or one of their associates. Marx gave him a message for Becker, which Lassalle 
did not use because he heard negative rumours about Becker in Italy. These 
were being spread by pro-Bonapartist refugees in Italy with whom Becker had 
refused to collaborate.— 356

Vol. 15) exposing the secret police agent Bangya, with whom Türr was closely 
associated.— 356

403 In June and July 1849 the Baden-Palatinate revolutionary army was fighting 
against the Prussian forces in Baden. Becker, who commanded a corps of the

108 The spring of 1862 saw an aggravation of the Constitutional conflict between 
Crown and Diet in Prussia (see Note 290). The liberal majority (mostly 
members of the Party of Progress) in the Chamber of Deputies refused to 
endorse the budget as presented and demanded that it be concretised to 
prevent the use for military purposes of funds which came under other 
headings. In the face of this opposition, the King disbanded the Diet on 11 
March. The 'New Era' Ministers resigned (see also Note 345). At the new 
elections, held on 28 April and 6 May, the Party of Progress again carried the 
day. The military reform bill was rejected once  more.—361,  366

in Mexico aimed at overthrowing the progressive Juarez government and 
turning Mexico into a colony. However, serious differences soon developed 
between the three powers as a result of which Britain and Spain withdrew their 
forces in April 1862. The French command refused to negotiate with the Mexican 
government and opened hostilities on 19 April. In the second half of the vear, 
more French forces were sent to Mexico.

414 Engels means the conciliatory policy of the Prussian National Assembly, which 
sought to accomplish the tasks of the 1848 revolution by purely parliamentary 
methods, without enlisting the support of the masses.—366 
415 In 1848, Rudolf Schramm was a deputy to the Prussian National Assembly 
from the constituency of Striegau (Strzegom). Marx and Engels described his 
parliamentary activity in the pamphlet The Great Men of the Exile (present 
edition, Vol. 11).—366 
416 New Orleans was surrendered by the Southerners on 29 April 1862, shortly 
after the fall of the forts protecting the approaches to the city from the 
Mississippi. The Northern troops entered New Orleans on 1 May. The capture 
of the city, an important political and military centre of the Confederacy, was a 
major success for the Unionist army. 
The analysis of the fighting given by Engels in this letter was used by Marx 
in the article 'The Situation in the American Theatre of War' (present edition, 
Vol. 19).—366 
417 This refers to the battles fought at Smolensk, 16 to 18 August, and Borodino, 7 
September 1812 in the course of Russia's liberation war against aggression by 
Napoleonic France.—367 
418 White trash was the contemptuous name with which slaveowning planters 
dubbed the poor whites in the Southern states.—367, 416 
419 On 14 January 1858 the Italian patriot Felice Orsini made an abortive attempt 
on the life of Napoleon III and was executed in March  1858.—  369 
420 The Merrimack, the rebels' first armoured vessel, destroyed several Unionist 
warships in March 1862. To prevent her falling into the hands of the 
Northerners, she was blown up by the Confederates on 11 May 1862, after they 
had evacuated the Norfolk naval base in Virginia.—369 
421 The Coercion Bills, passed by the British Parliament in 1833 and 1847, aimed at 
suppressing the revolutionary movement in Ireland. They introduced a state of 
emergency throughout Ireland and gave extraordinary powers to the British 
authorities.— 369 
422 In 1862 large amounts of paper money ('greenbacks') were issued in the USA 
to cover the costs of the Civil War. This gradually led to inflation.—  370,  419 
423 xhe Morrill Tariff—the protectionist tariff sponsored by the Republican 
Justin Smith Morrill. Passed by the House of Representatives in May 1860, it 
became law on 2 March 1861, after being approved by the Senate. It raised 
customs duties considerably.—370 
424 In April 1862 the British and Spanish troops were withdrawn from Mexico 
following the Palmerston government's refusal to continue to collaborate with 
France in the armed intervention there (see also Note 411).—370 
425 This refers to Mary and Lizzy Burns. Engels was renting lodgings in Hyde 
Road (see Note 386) under the name of Frederick Boardman. Mary Burns 
figured as Mary Boardman.—370 
426 Engels means the advance of the Northern troops under General Halleck on 
Corjnth, Mississippi, in April and May 1862. Its very slow progress gave rise to 
press allegations by pro-Secessionist correspondents (including James Spence) 
about Halleck's army finding itself in dire straits.—371

Notes 635 
427 Embrassez-vous et que cela finisse! (Embrace and have done with it!) is an allusion 
to an episode in the French Revolution: on 7 July 1792 Lamourette, a deputy 
to the Legislative Assembly, proposed ending all political strife by a fraternal 
kiss.  Following his appeal, members of antagonistic groupings embraced each 
other. However, as was to be expected, this artificial attempt at a reconciliation 
proved a failure. The 'fraternal kiss' was forgotten the next day. 
Engels uses the dictum ironically, in reference to the debates in the Prussian 
Chamber of Deputies, which was elected on 6 May 1862 (see Note 408) and 
first met on 19 May.— 373 
428 The Hesse-Cassel affair—the long conflict in Hesse-Cassel (1850-62) between 
Elector Ludwig Ill's reactionary government and the Chamber of Deputies, 
which demanded the reintroduction of the moderate liberal Constitution of 
1831.  The liberal party was supported by Prussia, which feared a strengthening 
of Austria in the struggle for hegemony in Germany. However, Prussia's 
attempts to influence the Hesse-Cassel government with a view to having the 
Constitution reintroduced were foiled by Ludwig III. The Prussian General 
Willisen sent to Hesse-Cassel in May 1862 with a message from William I was 
given an insulting reception. The Constitution of 1831 was reintroduced at the 
end of June 1862, after Prussia had presented Ludwig III with an ultimatum 
and mobilised two army corps.—373 
429 The  Schiller Institute was set up in Manchester in November 1859 in connection 
with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth. Its founders intended it as a 
cultural and social centre for Manchester's German community. Initially, Engels 
took almost no part in the Institute's activities, but in January 1864 he became 
a member of its Directorate, and eventually its chairman.—374, 524 
430 Engels presumably means his translation of the old Danish song Herr Jon, 
contained in the collection Et Hundrede udvalde Danske Viser, om allehaande

You stay out there, said Jon. 
He banged on the door with shield 
and spear. 
Get up, Herr Jon, and come out here. 
No, you must wait, said Jon. 
If my bride must be molested so, 
Then to the King's ear it must go. 
Of course it must, said Jon.

431 The Schwabenspiegel is a code of common law compiled in Swabia in the 13th 
century, a period of feudal fragmentation in Germany. Julian Schmidt, in his 
book, mistakenly describes it as a monument of Swabian poetry. 
Julian Schmidt erroneously listed among the 'seven wise men' of Greece 
(Solon, Bias, Pittacus, Gleobul, Chilon, Myson and Thaies, all of whom lived in 
the 7th-6th centuries B.C.) Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Democritùs and other later

450 To cope with Britain's increased national debt, William Pitt's government set up 
in 1786 a redemption fund, to finance which it raised existing and introduced 
new, indirect taxes. 
The Tax Bill, passed in the USA in April 1862, was shelved. To cover its 
military expenditure the Federal government had recourse to the emission of 
paper money (see Note 422).—400, 421 
4o1 The physiocrats were a school of bourgeois political economy that emerged in 
France in the 1750s. They held Nature to be the only source of wealth, and 
agriculture the only sphere of the economy where value was created. Advocates 
of large-scale capitalist farming, they showed the moribund nature of the 
feudal economy, thus contributing to the ideological preparation of the 
bourgeois revolution in France. Marx gave a critical analysis of the physiocrats' 
views in Notebook VI of his Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 (present edition,

At the second battle of Bull Run (for the first see Note 390) near Manassas 
(southwest of Washington) on 29 and 30 August 1862, their forces, 
commanded by General Pope, suffered a severe defeat and had to retreat 
towards Washington. To prevent the fall of the capital, the Federal command 
had to bring in reinforcements.—414, 457 
459 In August 1862 the War Department in Washington ordered that henceforth 
only officers of the regular army could be promoted to Brigadier General or 
Major General. Volunteer officers could only be raised to those ranks for

'- Marx refers to his article 'A Note on the Amnesty' (see present edition, 
Vol. 19). Based on data sent to him by Wilhelm Wolff from Manchester in a 
letter written between 10 and 12 September 1862, it revealed the demagogic 
nature of the 1861 political amnesty in Prussia (see Note 256) and was rather 
widely read in Germany. The article appeared in the Barmer Zeitung and was 
reprinted in the Niederrheinische Volks-Zeitung and the Märkische Volks-
Zeitung. —417 
63 On 23 September 1862, at the height of the Constitutional crisis (see Note 408), 
Bismarck was appointed Prime Minister of Prussia. This move signalled the 
government's resolve to go ahead with the planned military reform, despite the 
refusal of the Chamber of Deputies to provide the funds for it.—418 
64 This refers to the Constitution adopted by the Frankfurt National Assembly on 
28 March 1849 (it was rejected by the King of Prussia and other German 
monarchs). On 28 September 1862, about 200 deputies to the diets of various 
German states, meeting in Weimar, urged the convocation of an all-German 
Parliament with a view to establishing, in keeping with that Constitution, a 
united federal all-German state, its members enjoying autonomy in internal 
affairs.—418 
,i5 On 21 March 1848, King Frederick William IV of Prussia declared that he was 
ready, for the salvation of Germany, to 'assume the leadership of the whole 
nation'. Hence the phrase 'Prussian leadership', which won currency as a 
euphemism for Prussia's striving to unite the country under its supremacy.—

,,() On 12 April 1862 Lassalle made a speech at a meeting of handicraftsmen in 
Oranienburg, a suburb of Berlin. It was published as a pamphlet under the

land, they continued to be exploited by their former masters, the rich planters, 
who had retained their dominant position in the South. Nor did the 
emancipation end racial discrimination. 
The Confederate forces that invaded Kentucky on 12 September 1862 
were defeated by the Unionists at Parryville on 8 October.—420, 428, 440 
K> Marx means the chronic financial crisis in Austria that set in in 1848. It led to 
an enormous growth of the national debt, the massive emission of paper money 
and depreciation ol currency. On this see Marx's article 'Highly Important from 
Vienna' (present edition, Vol. 16).

usual 5. According to The Times, in October 1862, the interest even rose to 29 
per cent.—421 
471 Marx means a series of revolutionary-democratic measures carried out by the 
Lincoln Administration from mid-1862 onwards. These included, besides the 
Emancipation Proclamation (see Note 468), the Homestead Act of 20 May 1862 
which, by distributing public lands without compensation to everyone wishing 
to cultivate it, provided a democratic solution to the agrarian problem. Of great 
importance were also the purge of the army and administration of traitors, and 
the Act on the confiscation of rebels' property. These and other measures 
ensured the victory of the North in the Civil War.—421 
472 This refers to the State and Congressional elections held in October and 
November 1862, which brought substantial losses for the Republicans as 
compared with previous elections, and victory for the Democrats in a number 
of states. For details see Marx's article 'The Election Results in the Northern 
States' (present edition, Vol. 19).—423 
473 In the elections of 4 November 1862 the New York State governorship went to 
the Democrat Horatio Seymour. Democrats also won the majority of Congress 
seats in New York.—428 
474 West Point, near New York, is the site of a military academy. Founded in 1802, 
it was the United States' only higher military educational establishment in the 
mid-19th century. Its graduates fought both in the Unionist and in the 
Confederate army. McClellan, too, studied at West Point. On this see Marx's 
article 'American Affairs' (present edition, Vol. 19).—428 
475 Engels evidently means the wave of dismissals, started on 23 October 1862, of 
Prussian officials who had supported the opposition in the Provincial Diet 
during the Constitutional conflict in Germany (see notes 408 and 463).—428 
47(i At the battle of Corinth, Mississippi, fought on 3 and 4 October 1862, the 
Unionists, commanded by General Rosecrans, defeated the Confederates, led 
by generals Van Dorn, Price and Lovell.—429 
477 Marx uses the word Sonderbund (separate union), which may be an allusion to 
the Swiss Sonderbund, the separatist union formed in 1843 by Switzerland's 
seven Catholic, economically backward cantons to resist progressive bourgeois 
reforms in the country. The decree of the Swiss Diet of July 1847 on the 
dissolution of the Sonderbund served as a pretext for the latter to open 
hostilities against the other cantons early in November. On 23 November 1847 the 
Sonderbund army was defeated by the federal forces. 
Marx developed the ideas contained in this letter in his article 'Symptoms of 
Disintegration in the Southern Confederacy' (present edition, Vol. 19).—430 
478 Marx means the returns of the autumn elections in the Northern States (see 
notes 472 and 473).—430 
479 This refers to the suppression by General Napoleon Bonaparte of a royalist 
mutiny against the Thermidorian Convention in Paris on 4 and 5 October (12 
and 13 Vendémiaire) 1795.—430 
480 A Presidential election was due in November 1864. The 38th Congress elected 
in the autumn of 1862 and first convened in December 1863 (see notes 472 
and 473) was to meet for its 1864 autumn session in December, after the 
Presidential election.—430

1 On 30 October 1862 the French government sent a message to Britain and 
Russia calling for joint action by the three powers to impose a ceasefire in the 
USA, lift the blockade and open the Southern ports to European trade. On 8 
November Russia, and later Britain, rejected Napoleon Ill's proposal to 
interfere in US home affairs.—430 
2 Calling for the unification of Germany under the aegis of Prussia, the Party of 
Progress (see Note 371) was advocating a Little Germany (see Note 24).—431 
3 This refers to French armed intervention in Mexico (see Note 411). 
By crapauds (French: toads; figuratively, nonentities) Marx means the 
Bonapartist generals.—431 
4 An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: Karl Marx, On 
America and the Civil War, New York, 1972. 
From 1858, Marx had had serious differences with Freiligrath over the Vogt 
affair (see Note 4), the attitude to Kinkel and other matters. In the spring of 
1862,  following Freiligrath's breach with Kinkel, who had joined the National 
Association (see Note 24), relations between Marx and Freiligrath began 
returning to normal.—432 
15 Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester and then with Eichhoff in Liverpool 
approximately from 5 to 13 December 1862.—432, 442 
16 This refers to a letter by Ludwig Kugelmann to Freiligrath of 21 November 
1862 with inquiry about the progress of Marx's economic studies. In 
forwarding the letter to Marx on 3 December, Freiligrath called it 'paroles d'un 
croyant' (an allusion to F. de Lamennais' book Paroles d'un Croyant, published in 
Paris in 1834). Marx's reply to it (see Note 488) marked the beginning of his 
correspondence and friendship with Kugelmann. —432, 435 
17 The Manichaeans were adherents of a religion that originated in the Middle 
East in the 3rd century A.D. In colloquial German, Manichäer also means an 
implacable creditor (by analogy with the phrase mahnender Gläubiger —dunning 
creditor).—432 
!s This letter opened the Marx-Kugelmann correspondence, which continued 
until 1874. In 1902 Marx's letters to Kugelmann dealing with the basic 
problems of the international working-class movement and Marxist theory were 
published by Karl Kautsky in the journal Die Neue Zeit. 
The English translation of this letter first appeared in: Karl Marx, Letters to 
Dr. Kugelmann, Co-operative Publishing Society of Foreign Workers in the 
USSR, Moscow-Leningrad, 1934.—435 
19 This refers to the abortive offensive of the Union army under Burnside on the 
Confederates' strongly fortified positions near Fredericksburg, on the southern 
bank of the Rappahannock (Virginia), in December 1862. The Union forces 
had reached Fredericksburg on 17 November but it was not until 13 December 
that they began to cross the river and advance. On the night of 14 December, 
after a series of unsuccessful attacks, Burnside's troops were forced to withdraw 
to the northern bank.—437, 439 
10 In late December 1862, workers and democrats in London, Manchester and 
Sheffield held mass meetings of solidarity with the Union states in their struggle to 
end slavery.—440

494 Marx means the section on machinery in Notebooks V and XIX-XX of his 
Economic Manuscript of 1861-63. Later this material formed the basis of 
Chapter XV of Vol. I of Capital (see present edition, Vol. 35).—446, 449

497 This refers to the speech Lassalle made in the Berlin criminal court on 16 
January 1863. It was published as a pamphlet, under the title Die Wissenschaft 
und die Arbeiter. Eine Vertheidigungsrede vor dem Berliner Criminalgericht, 
Zürich, 1863.—451 
498 Marx means the second publication of Lassalle's speech of 12 April 1862 (see 
Note 466). It appeared in Zurich in 1863 under the title Arbeiterprogramm. 
Ueber den besondern Zusammenhang der gegenwärtigen Geschichtsperiode mit der Idee 
des Arbeiterstandes. —451 
499 In January 1863 an uprising against Tsarist oppression erupted in the 
Kingdom of Poland (see Note 513). It was an expression of the Poles' striving 
for national independence and of the crisis of feudal relations within the 
Kingdom. On 22 January 1863 the National Committee, which headed the 
uprising, put forward a programme of struggle for Poland's independence and 
a number of democratic agrarian demands. In May the Committee constituted 
itself the National Government. However, its inconsistency and indecision, in 
particular its failure to abolish the privileges of the big landowners, alienated 
the peasants, the majority of whom stayed away from the uprising. This was 
one of the main causes of its defeat. The movement was, by and large, crushed 
by the Tsarist government towards the autumn of 1863, though some units of 
the insurgents continued the struggle until the end of 1864. 
The leaders of the uprising pinned great hopes on help from the West 
European powers, but these confined themselves to diplomatic representations 
and, in effect, betrayed the insurgents. 
The Polish uprising was enthusiastically supported by Russian and West 
European democrats.—453, 460, 464

500 ]vj arx probably means the Little Germans (see Note 24) who supported the 
national liberation struggle of the Italians and Hungarians against Austrian 
domination, their aim being a weakening of Austria, Prussia's main rival in the 
drive for the unification of Germany 'from above', under the supremacy of the 
ruling classes.—453 
501 This refers to the French intervention in Mexico (see Note 411). 
The Lower Empire (Bas-Empire in French) is the name sometimes given to 
the Byzantine Empire and also to the late Roman Empire. In a more general 
sense, the name is applied to any state going through a period of decline and 
disintegration. Marx means the Second Empire in France.—453, 463 
302 An allusion to Alexander Herzen's 'Fraternal Appeal to Russian Warriors', 
published in Kolokol (The Bell), No. 155, 1 February 1863. It called on Russian 
officers and soldiers to receive as brothers the Polish recruits brought into the 
army under the levy declared in Poland by the Tsarist government in October 
1862.—453 
503 In 1849, the bourgeois republican Armand Marrast, President of the French 
Constituent Assembly, requested General Changarnier to bring in troops for 
the protection of the Assembly, which was being threatened by the Bonapar-
tists.  Changarnier refused, declaring that he disapproved of 'baïonnettes 
intelligentes', i. e. soldiers meddling in politics.—454 
504 Marx presumably means the attempt, in 1863, to organise a military expedition 
to Circassia involving Urquhartites and Polish émigrés. The party was to be 
carried by the ship Chesapeak.—454, 492 
305 General Joseph Hooker succeeded Burnside as commander of the Army of the 
Potomac in January 1863, after the latter's dismissal following the defeat on the 
Rappahannock (see Note 489).—454 
506 Marx's eight-year-old son Edgar died at 28 Dean Street, Soho, on 6 April 
1855.—454 
507 In 1863 the Prussian government, fearing the spread of the Polish national 
liberation uprising to the parts of Poland held by Prussia, and hoping to win 
Russia's support for its endeavours to unite Germany under Prussian 
supremacy, offered the Tsarist government military aid for the suppression of 
the uprising. On 8 February, on Bismarck's initiative, the two Parties concluded 
the Alvensleben convention (so called after the Adjutant General of the King of 
Prussia, who signed it) on joint action against the insurgents. The convention 
was not ratified.—455, 456, 537 
508 Marx carried out this plan, if only in part, at the end of October 1863 when he 
wrote a 'Proclamation on Poland by the German Workers' Educational Society 
in London' (present edition, Vol. 19) which was published in November as a 
leaflet on behalf of the Society (see Note 3).—455, 458 
509 In 1861 a Polish youth society was formed in Paris by the most active element 
of the Polish national liberation movement. In October of that year the society 
started a military school in Genoa to train officers for an insurrection in 
Poland. The instructors at the school, which was later transferred to Cuneo 
(also in Italy), prepared a number of military manuals and had them published 
in Paris.—456

published in that journal on 1 October 1862. It recognised the right of the 
peoples of Lithuania, Byelorussia and the Ukraine to self-determination as one 
of the main principles of the future national liberation uprising. The letter 
evoked a sharp protest from Mieroslawski and other moderate Polish 
democrats advocating the great-power slogan of the inviolability of Poland's 
frontiers of 1772. Bakunin attacked this stance in the pamphlet Le comité central 
de Varsovie et le comité militaire russe. Réponse au général Mieroslawski, London, 
1862.  Mieroslawski replied with the pamphlet Dernière réponse à M. Michel 
Bakounine, published in Paris on 20 January 1863. The Mieroslawski-Bakunin 
polemic was given broad coverage in the press.—456 
511 Engels speaks about the possible revival of the Holy Alliance, the association of 
European monarchs founded at the Congress of Vienna on 26 September 1815 
on the initiative of Emperor Alexander I of Russia and the Chancellor of 
Austria, Metternich, for protecting the 'legitimate' regimes restored after the 
victory over Napoleon and for suppressing revolutionary and national 
liberation movements.—456, 505, 513, 543 
512 The pamphlet, on which Marx worked from mid-February to the end of May 
1863,  failed to materialise. Marx's numerous manuscripts, drafts and excerpts 
on the subject were published by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC 
CPSU in the Marx-Engels Archives, Vol. XIV, Moscow, 1973 and also in Warsaw 
in: Marks K., Przyczynki do historii kwestii polskiej (Rekopisy z lat 1863-1864), 1971. 
No manuscripts by Engels relating to the pamphlet in question have been 
found.—458, 459, 461 
513 There were three divisions of Poland between Prussia, Austria and Russia, in 
1772,  1793 and 1795. As a result, Russia obtained Lithuanian, Byelorussian and 
Ukrainian territories, while Prussia and Austria gained portions of Poland 
proper. By decision of the Congress of Vienna, 1814-15 (see Note 511), a large 
part of the original Polish lands was annexed to Russia under the name of the 
Kingdom (Tsardom) of Poland.—459, 470, 538 
514 On 18 February 1863 the liberal majority in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies 
criticised the Prusso-Russian convention against the Polish insurgents (see 
Note 507) and passed a resolution urging the Prussian government to remain 
neutral.—461 
515 This refers to Kugelmann's letter to Marx of 18 March 1863.—461 
516 On 10 March 1863 Langiewicz, who led a unit of insurgents in the Sandomierz 
province, in South Poland, was proclaimed 'dictator' by the conservative 
bourgeois and landowner party of the 'Whites'. His government, established as 
a result of backstage intrigues, opposed the revolutionary leadership of the 
uprising, notably the National Central Committee of the petty-bourgeois and 
szlachta (gentry) party of the 'Reds', which was acting as a provisional national 
government. However, as early as 19 March Langiewicz abandoned his unit, 
which was being pushed back by superior forces of the Tsarist army, and fled 
to Austria.—461, 464 
517 Letters of marque were licenses granted by the state to private persons to seize 
and destroy enemy and neutral vessels carrying cargoes for enemy states. The 
Paris declaration of 1856 on maritime law (see Note 378) abolished 
privateering.—462

On the Trent affair see Note 366.—462 
Marx is referring to Palmerston's treacherous policy towards Poland. The 
immediate occasion for these comments were extracts from Palmerston's speech 
on Poland in the House of Commons on 23 March 1863, given in The Times 
and The Morning Star on the following day. Marx's manuscripts for the book 
on Poland he intended to write (see Note 512) contain the following passage 
from The Morning Star of 24 March: 'For he told the House of Commons again 
last night that his view of the Polish question was quite unaltered—that he 
adheres now to the position he took up in 1831: that our obligations are 
exhausted by a note "representing in friendly terms to the Emperor of Russia 
considerations as to the arrangements he would make for the re-establishment 
of tranquility in Poland".' (See Marx-Engels Archives, Vol. XIV, Moscow, 1973, 
p. 512.)—462 
This refers to the speech by Plon-Plon (Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul 
Bonaparte) in the Senate on 18 March 1863. In his manuscripts for a book on 
Poland (see Note 512) Marx called this speech a 'farce' (Marx-Engels Archives, 
Vol. XIV, Moscow, 1973, p. 502).—463 
There were riots by starving unemployed weavers in the industrial towns of 
Ashton and Staleybridge, Lancashire, in March 1863 caused by the cotton crisis 
in Britain during the US Civil War of 1861-65 (see Note 385). Large forces of 
police, and regular troops of infantry and cavalry were employed against the 
rioters.—463 
The Polish insurrection started off a wave of peasant risings against the 
landowners and Tsarist autocracy in Lithuania and West Byelorussia in 
February and March 1863. The Lithuanian provincial committee, which led the 
movement both in Lithuania and in Byelorussia, declared its solidarity with the 
programme of the Polish insurrection put forward by the Provisional National 
Committee in Warsaw. The armed insurgent units in Lithuania and Byelorussia 
consisted mostly of peasants, and also included artisans, students and members 
of the landless nobility. Their leaders were the revolutionary democrats 
Konstanty Kalinowski, Zygmunt Sierakowski and Walery Wröblewski. The 
special significance of the Lithuanian risings lay in their democratic tendency 
and the opportunities they created for the movement to spread into Russia. 
Congress Poland was the part of Poland annexed to Russia by decision of the 
Congress of Vienna (1814-15) under the name of the Kingdom (Tsardom) of 
Poland.—464 
Engels is referring to the following passage in Kugelmann's letter to Marx of 
18 March 1863: T have been repeatedly told of late that Engels' Condition of  the 
Working Classes in England is inaccurate and one-sided, indeed that the author, 
himself has disowned his work as a piece of immature juvenilia. Is it true? I 
can't believe it.' Further on Kugelmann suggested that the book should be 
republished.—465 
Plonplonism—from Plon-Plon, nickname of Napoleon Ill's cousin, Napoléon 
Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte, who led a Bonapartist faction that sought to 
distract the masses from struggle against the existing regime by means of 
large-scale social demagoguery and ostensible opposition to the policy of

Napoleon III. Plon-Plon took an equally demagogic stand on the national 
liberation struggle of the Hungarian, Italian and Polish peoples and acted, in 
effect, as a vehicle of Napoleon Ill's foreign policy, recruiting supporters for it 
among bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democratic émigrés. —466, 505 
525 On 10 February 1863 the Leipzig central committee for the convocation of a 
general German working men's congress requested Lassalle to set forth his 
views on the problems of the working-class movement. Lassalle responded by 
writing a pamphlet entitled Offnes Antwortschreiben an das Central-Comité zur 
Berufung eines Allgemeinen Deutschen Arbeitercongresses zu Leipzig (Zurich, 1863). 
He suggested that the pamphlet be made the 'official manifesto of the 
movement'. Below Marx quotes from pp. 11, 23, 36 et seq. of the 
pamphlet.—467 
52h Qn 26 March 1863 the London Trades Union Council held a meeting at 
St James's Hall to express the British workers' solidarity with the North American 
States' struggle to abolish slavery. It was chaired by John Bright, an opponent of 
Britain's armed intervention in the US Civil War on the side of the Southern 
States.—468 
527 The Independents were a Protestant trend in England. In the 1580s and 1590s 
they constituted the left wing of the Puritan movement and were in radical 
opposition to absolutism and the Church of England. During the English 
revolution of the seventeenth century, the Independents formed a political 
party which held power under Oliver Cromwell (1649-53).— 468 
528 This refers to an item in the Berliner Reform of 10 April 1863 which gave a 
distorted account of the talks on the joint publication of a newspaper Marx had 
had with Lassalle when visiting Berlin in the spring of 1861. On 13 April 1863 
Marx wrote a refutation, which was published by the Berliner Reform on 
17 April (see present edition, Vol.  19).—  469 
529 Schulze-Delitzsch's agitation among German workers and handicraftsmen for 
the establishment of co-operative societies and savings banks with funds 
contributed by the workers themselves was an attempt to distract them from 
the revolutionary struggle against capital and to perpetuate the bourgeoisie's 
influence on the proletariat. By claiming that co-operative societies were capable 
of improving the workers' condition within the framework of capitalism and 
saving the handicraft producers from ruin, Schulze-Delitzsch was preaching the 
harmony of the capitalists' and workers' interests. In his pamphlet Offnes 
Antwortschreiben ... (see Note 525) Lassalle attacked these views and, instead, 
advocated universal suffrage and the reformist idea of producers' associations 
to be set up by workers with the aid of the state, which he regarded as a 
supra-class institution.—470 
530 i"he LiVOnians were the inhabitants of Livonia, a Baltic area which is now part 
of the Latvian and Estonian republics within the USSR. Originally inhabited by 
the Livs, an extinct Finno-Ugric group, Livonia was conquered by the German 
Knights in the thirteenth century and formed the nucleus of the Livonian 
Order. In the second half of the sixteenth century it became part of the Rzecz 
Pospolita (Poland); and in the seventeenth century, joined Sweden. In 1721, as 
a result of the Northern War, it was included in the Russian Empire and in 
1783 was constituted a separate gubernia, Livland, within Russia.—471

:i3i -phis refers to an episode of the Constitutional conflict in Prussia (see Note 
408).  In May 1863 a clash in the Prussian Diet between War Minister Roon 
and Deputy Sybel gave rise to a controversy over whether the president of the 
Diet had the right to interrupt speakers, in particular government Ministers. 
The Bismarck government was adamant on the issue, denying this right to the 
president. Engels pokes fun at the debate started in this connection by the 
deputies of the Party of Progress (see Note 371) and the draft resolution they 
tabled. On 15 May the Diet recognised by a majority vote the president's right 
to interrupt any deputy. In retaliation, the Diet was closed down by Royal 
decree on 27 May, ahead of time, and a restrictive decree on the press issued 
on 1 June.—473 
,32 In April and May 1863 a sharp political struggle developed between Lassalle 
and the bourgeois Party of Progress (see Note 371) in connection with Lassalle's 
propaganda campaign preparatory to the establishment of the General 
Association of German Workers (see Note 536). Lassalle's stepped-up attacks on 
the Party of Progress were countered by sharp articles in the bourgeois press 
accusing him of collaboration with Bismarck.—473 
533 Marx means the manifesto on the 1863 insurrection in Poland (see Note 508) 
which he intended to write jointly with Engels on behalf of the German 
Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 3).—474

collaboration with Engels. Its tentative title was Deutschland und Polen.

greater part (Notebooks I-XXI) of the Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 (see 
Note 310). The excerpts are in eight 'Supplementary Notebooks' (Beihefte), 
marked with the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. When writing the last two 
notebooks of the 1861-63 manuscript (XXII and XXIII), filled up between May 
and July 1863, Marx was already drawing on the 'Supplementary 
Notebooks'.—474 
536 By the new movement Marx means the General Association of German Workers, the 
political organisation founded at the congress of workers' associations in 
Leipzig on 23 May 1863. Lassalle was elected president of the Association. Its 
establishment was a milestone in freeing the German workers from the 
influence of the liberal bourgeoisie and forming an independent political 
organisation of tfje proletariat. However, the reformist programme imposed on 
the Association by Lassalle (see Note 525) was an obstacle to its becoming a 
revolutionary party of the proletariat. Lassalle's policy was meeting with 
growing opposition within the Association from Liebknecht, Becker, Klings and 
other members who relied on the support, of Marx and Engels. —475

543 The Free Traders were British industrialists advocating non-interference bv the 
state in business, notably the repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws. Their 
centre was Manchester. The movement was led by the textile manufacturers 
Cobden and Bright, who founded the Anti-Corn Law League in 1838.—480 
544 Widespread discontent with the policy of the bourgeois and landowner party of 
the 'Whites', who usurped the leadership of the uprising (see Note 499) In 
April-May 1863, prompted the revolutionary elements within the insurgents' 
organisation in Warsaw to take over power at the end of May. One of the 
slogans of the new National Government, composed of moderate 'Reds' (see 
Note 516), was the formation of a universal militia with a view to enrolling the 
peasant masses in the guerrilla struggle. However, within ten days the 'Whites' 
reasserted themselves in the National Government. Reluctant openly to reject 
the popular slogan of a universal militia they 'postponed' its implementation 
indefinitely. As a result, the insurrection remained fragmented and failed to 
assume nationwide proportions.—483

547 In late July or in August 1863 a new stage began in Marx's work on Capital, 
when he rewrote the 1861-63 manuscript (see Note 310) producing, by the 
beginning of 1866, a third rough draft of the theoretical part of Capital (three 
books).  In the present letter Marx writes about his work on Book I.—488, 530 
548 Marx's wife and daughters spent three weeks on holiday in Hastings, on the 
South coast of England, from 14 August to 4 September 1863. The main

552 After seizing Mexico City in 1863, the French interventionists on 18 June set 
up a Supreme Junta, composed of 35 conservatives nominated by the French 
commander. The junta called an assembly of notables, who on 10 July 
proclaimed Mexico an 'empire' under the rule of Archduke Maximilian of 
Austria, a placeman of Napoleon III. Marx ironically compares this 'suffrage' 
by the Mexican notables with the elections of 10 December 1848 in France, in 
which Louis Bonaparte secured the Presidency of the French Republic, and 
with the referendum he held in 1860 in Savoy and Nice, after their annexation 
by France as a result of the 1859 Austro-Italo-French war.—489 
553 In March 1863, Polish refugees in England fitted out a corps of about 
200 Poles, Frenchmen and Italians for participation in the Polish uprising. 
Commanded by Colonel Lapinski, they were to sail to Lithuania on the steamer 
Ward Jackson and join the insurgents there. However, the expedition failed due 
to poor organisation and inadequate security precautions. On arrival in Malmö, 
in April, the ship and the members of the expedition were detained by the 
Swedish authorities. Bakunin who had joined the corps at the Swedish port of 
Hälsingborg, after the detention of the ship, went to Stockholm, where he 
stayed till October trying to establish contacts with Swedish and Finnish 
revolutionaries.—490, 492

promulgation, on 18 November, of a new Constitution proclaiming the final 
incorporation of Schleswig and Holstein into the domains of the Danish 
monarch led to a rise of the anti-Danish national liberation movement in the 
two duchies and a sharp aggravation of Danish-German differences.—493

Austria, who wanted no open violation of the 1852 London Protocol (see 
Note 380). Under pressure from Austria and Prussia, their proposal was 
adopted, and by 31 December Saxon and Hanover troops had occupied the

Literature and Art, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1976 and in The Letters of Karl

Saul K. Padover, Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1979.—507 
71 The enthronement of Christian IX as King of Denmark (see notes 557 and 
558) led to a controversy in Germany over the status of the duchies of 
Schleswig and Holstein. The smaller and medium-sized German states, through 
their representatives in the German Federal Diet, supported Friedrich of 
Augustenburg as claimant to the two duchies. In conformity with the London 
protocol of 1852, Austria recognised Christian IX's title to them. Prussia 
(Bismarck), while ostensibly taking a stand similar to Austria's, from the outset 
worked for the annexation of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia. The so-called 
execution (see Note 568) failed to eliminate the inner-German differences. 
The Warsaw Protocol, mentioned by Marx below, was signed by Russia 
and Denmark on 5 June 1851. It proclaimed the indivisibility of the Danish 
Crown possessions, including Schleswig and Holstein. —507 
.72 xhe  entry of Austro-Prussian troops into Schleswig on 1 February 1864 opened 
the Danish war, which marked an important stage in the struggle to unify 
Germany under Prussia's aegis. The purpose of the war was to sever Schleswig 
and Holstein from Denmark. Under the Vienna treaty of 30 October 1864, the 
two duchies were declared co-possessions of Austria and Prussia. After the 
1866 Austro-Prussian war they were annexed to Prussia.—509, 538

to tell him about his trip to Germany and Holland (see Note  561).—  511,  518

75 The Mormons are members of a religious sect founded in the United States in 
1830 by Joseph Smith (1805-1844). The Book of Mormon which he wrote in 
1830,  allegedly on the basis of divine revelation, tells, in the name of the 
prophet Mormon, of the migration of Israelite tribes into America, which is 
claimed to have taken place in antiquity.— 512 
,76 In the spring of 1848, Schleswig and Holstein were swept by a national 
liberation movement against Danish domination and for unification with 
Germany. The states of the German Confederation, with Prussia at the head, 
opened hostilities against Denmark, but it soon became clear that the Prussian 
government had no intention to uphold the interests of the liberation 
movement. The seven-month truce concluded in Malmö on 26 August 1848 
nullified the revolutionary and democratic gains in Schleswig and Holstein and 
virtually ensured the continuance of Danish domination. The Prusso-Danish 
war, resumed at the end of March 1849 and carried on until 1850, ended in 
victory for Denmark, which retained Schleswig and Holstein. (See also 
Note 324.)—513 
1,7 At the end of February 1864, after the Prussian troops had entered Jutland 
(see Note 572), the British government, to prevent the spread of hostilities, 
proposed calling in London a conference of the powers signatory to the 1852 
protocol on the integrity of the Danish monarchy (see Note 324) with a view to 
settling the Prusso-Austro-Danish conflict. However, the conference, initially 
due to open on 12 April 1864, was repeatedly postponed because Prussia and 
Austria, who were doing everything to delay its convocation, did not send their

representatives. Though it did open eventually, the two-month deliberations 
(25 April to 25 June) produced no results because of sharp contradictions 
between the participants. No sooner did the conference close than Prussia and 
Austria resumed the fighting in Denmark.—513, 517, 519, 538, 543

preventing any help to the Polish insurgents.— 513 
581 According to Epicurus, there is an endless multitude of worlds whose origin 
and existence is governed by their own natural laws. Gods exist too, but outside 
those worlds, in the spaces between them, and exert no influence whatever on 
the evolution of the universe or on human life.—515 
582 "rhe  British government hoped to exploit Garibaldi's visit to England in April 
1864 (see Note 579) to bring pressure to bear on Austria. It also had to take 
into account the enthusiastic welcome given to Italy's national hero by the 
public at large. Official honours were therefore bestowed on him at the 
beginning of his visit. However, the British bourgeoisie were angered by 
Garibaldi's meeting with Mazzini, who lived in London as a political émigré, 
and by his speeches in support of the Polish insurgents. A campaign against 
the Italian revolutionary was launched in the press. In connection with 
a request by Napoleon III for Garibaldi's immediate expulsion from Britain, 
the House of Commons discussed his health and a number of bourgeois 
newspapers hastened to announce that he 'was ill and leaving for Caprera'. 
Garibaldi denied this fabrication, declaring that he intended to visit several 
English cities. The result was an open statement by Gladstone to the effect that 
Garibaldi's further stay in Britain was undesirable. Soon after that, at the end 
of April, Garibaldi left the country.— 516 
58:i Meetings in honour of Garibaldi were held at the Crystal Palace (see Note 246) 
on 16 and 18 April.— 516 
584 In 1844 letters from the Bandiera brothers to Mazzini containing the plan for 
their expedition to Calabria were opened by order of Sir James Graham, the 
British Home Secretary. The members of the expedition were arrested. The

(i0i) In a letter to Friedrich Moll and Julius Melchior of 27 May 1864, Karl Klings 
describes the celebration in Germany of the first anniversary of the General 
Association of German Workers (see Note 536), stressing, in particular, lhal 
working-class audiences enthusiastically reacted to speakers' references to Marx 
and F^ngels. Klings requested Moll and Melchior to tell Marx that the workers 
wished to 'be worthy of such champions of their cause' as Marx and 
Engels. — 533 
1,10 Marx gave lectures on wage-labour and capital at the German Workers' Society 
in Brussels in the latter half of December 1847. These lectures formed the basis 
of his Wage-Labour and Capital, published as editorials in the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung, Nos. 264-67 and 269, 5-8 and 11 April 1849 (present edition, Vol. 9). 
Later he gave up his intention to reproduce Wage-Labour and Capital as an 
appendix to Vol. I of Capital. He did, however, cite individual passages from it 
in notes to Volume I (see present edition, Vol. 35, author's notes to Part VII). 
In the Preface to the first German edition of Volume 1 Marx pointed out that 
Lassalle had borrowed many important theoretical propositions from his

17 Preparing to write a detailed biography of Wilhelm  Wolff,  Marx in June 1864 
drew up a brief list of dates on the subject (see his 'Biographical Notes on 
Wilhelm  Wolff,  present edition, Vol. 19). However, the project failed to 
materialise. In 1876, Engels carried it out in his series of articles, 'Wilhelm

Lassalle's death.—558 
632 Richmond, the capital of the Southern Confederacy, was the rebels' main 
stronghold, protected by their elite troops. In the course of the Civil War, the 
Northerners fought three major campaigns to seize it. The first ended in their 
defeat at Bull Run on 21 July 1861 (see Note 390). In the second—spring and 
summer 1862—they were repulsed and had to retreat to Washington (see 
Note 458). The third, launched in May 1864 and crowned by the capture of 
Richmond on 3 April 1865 (see Note 618), was crucial in securing the Union's 
victory in the war.—558 
633 In May 1864 the Union command embarked on a new plan for crushing the 
Confederacy, which in many respects coincided with the strategic propositions 
put forward by Marx and Engels in the article 'The American Civil War' as 
early as March 1862 (see present edition, Vol. 19). Simultaneously with Grant's 
offensive on the Central Front in Virginia (see Note 602) General Sherman 
launched, on 7 May 1864, his famous 'march to the sea'. Fighting his way 
through Georgia at the cost of heavy losses, he seized Atlanta on 2 September 
and reached the sea on 10 December. By cutting the Confederate territory in 
two, Sherman's march provided the conditions for the rout of the main 
Confederate forces in Virginia in the spring of 1865.—559

638 634 On 8 November 1864, Presidential and Congressional elections were to be held 
in the United States. The National Convention of the Republican Party in 
Baltimore adopted, on 7 June 1864, a campaign programme calling for the 
abolition of slavery throughout the territory of the Union, and renominated 
Abraham Lincoln as candidate for the Presidency.—559 
After briefly meeting Marx in London on 8 September 1864 and visiting his 
mother in Ostende, Engels travelled in Schleswig-Holstein until mid-October.— 
560 
Marx means the year-long period of Lassalle's large-scale propaganda activities 
that followed the establishment of the General Association of German Workers 
in May 1863 (see Note 536) and his election to its presidency.—560 
The city of Coblenz in Western Germany was the centre of the counter­
revolutionary emigration during the French Revolution. After the defeat of the 
1848-49 European revolutions, many petty-bourgeois refugees flocked to 
Switzerland.— 561 
The demagogues were members of an opposition movement among German . 
intellectuals. The word won circulation in this sense after the Carlsbad 
Conference of Ministers of German States'in August 1819, which adopted a 
special resolution against the 'intrigues of demagogues'.—561 
(>39 This refers to Wilhelm Dönniges' work 'Jahrbücher des Deutschen Reichs 
unter der Herrschaft König und Kaiser Ottos I. von 951 bis 973' in Jahrbücher 
des Deutschen Reichs unter dem Sächsischen Hause. Herausgegeben von Leopold 
Ranke. Erster Band. Dritte Abtheilung. Berlin, 1839. In calling Dönniges a 
born 'valet' of history, Marx is alluding to the saying, 'No man is a hero to his valet' 
which was quoted, in particular, by Hegel in his Vorlesungen  über  die Philosophie  der 
Geschichte. —561 
640 Marx means the General Association of German Workers (see Note 536).— 561 
641 This refers to the Berlin Workers' Association, founded in January 1863. It was 
under the influence of the Party of Progress. Schulze-Delitzsch frequently gave 
lectures on the co-operative movement to its members (see also Note 529).— 
561 
642 From 16 February to 25 March I860, Marx stayed in Manchester discussing 
with Engels and Wilhelm Wolff plans for exposing the Bonapartist agent Karl 
Vogt, who was libelling Marx and his associates.—567 
643 xhis refers to Marx's book A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, 
which was published in 1859 and soon became known in Russia (see this 
volume, pp. 157, 193-94).—567 
644 Jenny Marx evidently means Wilhelm von Humboldt's abortive attempt to 
introduce a modicum of constitutionalism. The onslaught of reaction forced 
him to resign the post of Minister of the Interior, which he had held from 
January to December 1819, and retire from politics altogether.—567 
645 Jenny Marx has 'gejenant', the past participle form of the 'jenaen', which she 
coined from the name of the town of Jena. On 14 October 1806 Napoleon's 
army routed Prussia's forces near Jena, compelling Prussia to surrender.—568 
641' From December 1850 to the autumn of 1856 the Marx family lived at 28 Dean 
Street, Soho, and after that at 9 (later 46) Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill.— 570

Notes 659 
This refers to the libellous campaign against Marx and his associates launched 
by Karl Vogt and supported by the bourgeois press. The barrister K. Hermann, 
who represented Vogt in his lawsuit against the Allgemeine Zeitung (see Note 22), 
described him as an  'abgerundete  Natur' ('an intellectually mature character'). The 
phrase tan also mean 'potbelly', and Marx puns on it in his polemical work Herr 
Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, p.  28).—  572 
Presumably an allusion to the Prodigal Son.— 579 
There were riots among Lancashire textile workers in connection with the 
cotton shortage caused by the Union's blockade of the Secessionist states during 
the US Civil War.—580 
Straubingers —travelling journeymen in Germany. Marx and Engels used the 
term to denote German artisans and also certain participants in the 
working-class movement who were still swayed by guild prejudices and the 
petty-bourgeois illusion that it was possible to return from capitalist large-scale 
industry to small handicraft production.— 580 
These remarks refer to the continuing Constitutional conflict between Bismarck 
and the Prussian Chamber of Deputies (see Note 290). On 2 September the 
Chamber was disbanded, but at the new elections the Party of Progress, the 
unfavourable conditions notwithstanding, again won the majority and suc­
ceeded in getting all its leaders (Jacoby, Schulze-Delitzsch, Waldeck and others) 
into the Chamber. 
Jenny's pessimistic remarks are consonant with Marx's assessment of the 
developments in Germany contained in his letter to Engels of 15 August 1863, 
in which he says: 'Our fatherland would seem to be m a pitiful state'. —584 
By the circular Jenny Marx means the 'Proclamation on Poland by the German 
Workers' Educational Society in London', written by Marx (see Note 508). 
By a letter from the 'Chair' she means a letter from |. Vahlteich, secretary of 
the General Association of German Workers (see Note 536), to Wilhelm Wolff 
in his capacity of member of the committee to raise funds for the Polish 
uprising of 1863-64. Vahlteich expressed the Association's support for the 
'Proclamation on Poland by the German Workers' Educational Society in 
London' and the Association's readiness to back it up with vigorous action. He 
also requested 50 copies of the 'Proclamation' for circulation to the 
Association's branches.—585, 586 
A sarcastic allusion to Lassalle's petitions to the Berlin Chief of Police of 3, 15 
and 17 November 1863 requesting the Prussian authorities to put an end to 
police harassment of the General Association of German Workers and instruct 
the police to ensure order during the Association's meetings. The agitation of 
the Association, he stressed, did not conflict with the interests of the Prussian 
state.—586 
'This letter was written in reply to one from Engels dated 9 June 1864 (see this 
volume, pp. 539-40).—588
