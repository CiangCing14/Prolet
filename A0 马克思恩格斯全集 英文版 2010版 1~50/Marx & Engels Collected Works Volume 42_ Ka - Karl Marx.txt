Preface 
Volume 42 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick 
Engels contains their correspondence from October 1864 to March 
1868.  Chronologically, the volume covers the period, very 
important for the history of Marxism and the international 
working-class movement, of the founding and the early years of 
the International Working Men's Association (the First Interna­
tional).  This period was also marked by the publication of Marx's 
most important work, Volume One of Capital. 
With the foundation of the International the correspondence of 
Marx and Engels became particularly intense and ideologically 
rich, and the circle of people with whom they corresponded, active 
members of the working-class movement in various countries, 
grew wider. An important place in their letters is devoted to the 
pressing problems of the organisation and revolutionary tactics of 
the working class, to the theory and practice of the proletarian 
struggle. 
Marx and Engels had countless ties with the working-class 
movement. This can be seen from the numerous letters published 
in this volume that deal with the activity of the International 
Working Men's Association, an organisation set up with Marx's 
direct participation. These letters are one of the most important 
sources revealing the history of the emergence of the International 
and the way that it turned under the guidance of Marx and 
Engels into a true centre for uniting the militant forces of the 
working class. All of Marx's previous activity had prepared him 
for the task of leading the movement of the international 
proletariat, and Engels was fully justified in writing later that 
among those who attended the meeting in St Martin's Hall,

XX Preface 
London, on 28 September 1864 to proclaim the International 
'there was only one person who was clear as to what was to 
happen and what was to be founded: it was the man who had 
already in 1848 issued to the world the call: "Proletarians of All 
Countries, Unite!"' (see Frederick Engels, 'Marx, Heinrich Karl', 
present edition, Vol. 27). 
'Marx was the heart and soul of this organisation' is how Lenin 
described the role of the founder and leader of the first 
international mass organisation of the proletariat (V. I. Lenin, 
Collected Works, Vol. 21, Moscow, 1977, p. 49). 
The letters included in this volume throw light on Marx's 
many-sided activity in the International Working Men's Associa­
tion, his leading role on its guiding body, the Central (General) 
Council, his active participation in all the discussions that took 
place in the Council, the drafting of its decisions and the 
preparation of congresses of the International, their agendas and 
resolutions. From the letters it is also obvious that after the 
founding of the International Engels constantly helped Marx in 
guiding it. Until his move from Manchester to London in 1870, 
Engels could not take part directly in the work of the General 
Council, but during those years too Marx discussed all important 
questions concerning the International with him, kept him 
informed of the course of discussions in the Council and of the 
decisions being drafted, and made use of his recommendations. 
Engels helped to draw up the tactical line of the International, 
explaining it in letters to active members of the working-class 
movement, particularly in Germany, and frequently wrote to the 
press to present the position of the International Working Men's 
Association on various questions. 
Marx guided the activity of the new organisation with charac­
teristic confidence, skilfully overcoming the difficulties obstructing 
the path of the development of an independent proletarian 
movement. He constantly thwarted attempts by petty-bourgeois 
democrats and supporters of sectarian and reformist trends to 
deflect the International Working Men's Association from a 
revolutionary course and to subject it to tasks and aims alien to the 
interests of the working-class movement. 
Marx's letters to Engels of 4 November, to Joseph Weydemeyer 
and Lion Philips of 29 November 1864 and others show what an 
effort it cost Marx, right from the foundation of the International, 
to counteract the constant attempts by petty-bourgeois elements to 
exert their influence over it. Thanks to Marx's endeavours the 
new organisation acquired a truly proletarian class character. The

first considerable success in this respect, of historic significance, 
was the adoption by the Central Council of the Inaugural Address 
and Provisional Rules of the International drafted by Marx. As 
Marx himself admitted, it was no easy task to work out a common 
platform for all the different contingents of the working class, 
with their different levels of development, that had been drawn 
into the ranks of the International. But Marx, author of its first 
programme and its associated documents, performed this task 
brilliantly. Without making the slightest concession of principle to 
sectarian trends, these documents did not shut the doors of the 
international organisation to the British trade unions, the French 
and Belgian Proudhonists, or the German Lassalleans. On learning 
from Marx of the content of the Inaugural Address, Engels wrote 
that he could not wait to see it and that 'it must be a real 
masterpiece' (see this volume, p. 20). 
While guiding the International and drafting all the most 
important documents that set out the strategy and tactics of the 
proletarian movement, Marx persistently did his utmost to ensure 
that in the daily battles for particular and purely economic 
demands the workers should gain an understanding of the 
common tasks of their class struggle against capitalism. The 
establishment of firm contacts by the International with the 
working-class organisations in various countries, the setting up of 
sections of the International in the main European countries, its 
active support of the strike movement in 1865-67, and the 
victories gained by striking workers in a number of industries in 
Britain and France thanks to this support—all this helped to 
enhance the authority of the International Working Men's 
Association and helped the workers to realise gradually the 
strength of proletarian solidarity. 
As the correspondence shows, during this period Marx and 
Engels devoted considerable attention to the formation and 
ideological training of progressive militants of the working class. 
Marx sought to create a strong nucleus of proletarian rev­
olutionaries on the General Council and administrative bodies of 
the International in various countries. Under his direct influence, 
the Germans Georg Eccarius, Friedrich Lessner and Karl Pfänder, 
the Frenchman Eugène Dupont, the Englishman Robert Shaw, the 
Swiss Hermann Jung and other members of the General Council 
acquired the necessary theoretical knowledge and became ac­
quainted with scientific socialism. The letters from Marx and 
Engels to Wilhelm Liebknecht, Paul Lafargue, Johann Philipp 
Becker, Joseph Weydemeyer and other eminent figures in the

XXII Preface 
working-class and socialist movement show how patiently and 
persistently they taught their friends and comrades, helping them 
with advice, responding to their requests and criticising their 
shortcomings and mistakes. 
In the period of the activity of the International the need for an 
independent workers' press was particularly acute. 'It is impossi­
ble to have a movement here without its own press-organ,' Marx 
wrote to Engels on 2 December 1864. From the inception of the 
International Working Men's Association Marx and Engels di­
rected their efforts towards setting up press-organs for it in 
Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland. They endeavoured to 
take part personally in the production of a number of newspapers 
and to lend them a revolutionary character. They also concerned 
themselves with the composition of the editorial boards and 
contributors and encouraged like-minded people to work on them 
(see Marx's letters to Engels of 2 December 1864, 9 May and 
26 December 1865 and others). Thanks to this, the leaders of the 
International not only organised the widespread publication of its 
documents in various countries, but also trained a whole galaxy of 
working-class journalists who propagated its ideas. 
Marx attached great importance to the establishment of close 
relations between the International and the British trade unions. 
He strongly supported the participation of their representatives in 
its founding, believing that this would help to disseminate the ideas 
of the International in Britain, then the citadel of the capitalist world 
and the country with the most developed and organised working-
class movement (see Marx's letter to Ludwig Kugelmann of 
29 November 1864). Marx saw the further drawing of the British 
trade unions into the ranks of the International as an important way 
of broadening its mass base in the British Isles, and also as a means of 
overcoming the narrow-mindedness typical of British trade unions, 
expressed in their efforts to limit their activity to the economic 
struggle. To arouse the political activity of the trade unions and turn 
them into real centres of resistance to the capitalist system—this was 
the task that Marx set before the International in including, 
among other things, the question of the trade unions in the 
agenda of the Geneva Congress (see Marx's letter to Her­
mann Jung of 20 November 1865). The General Council relied 
on the support of the trade unions, organising campaigns to aid 
strikers both in Britain and on the Continent and thereby 
helping to kindle a spirit of proletarian solidarity in British 
workers.

Preface XXIII 
The leaders of the large London trade unions represented a 
considerable force on the General Council, and from the very 
beginning of the International Marx sought to use the authority of 
these 'real worker-kings of London' (p. 44) in order to strengthen 
the position of the International in Britain. At the same time, 
taking into account the ideological dependence of many trade 
union leaders on bourgeois liberals and radicals, he did his utmost 
to counteract any reformist tendencies shown by them. Marx's 
tactics aimed at removing obstacles to making the British working 
class a revolutionary force. He frequently managed to encourage 
reformist-minded trade union leaders to act in a revolutionary 
way. 
One of the most striking episodes in the activity of the 
International in Britain was its participation in the broad 
movement for electoral reform that began in spring 1865. On 
Marx's advice, the British members of the General Council joined 
with representatives of the radical bourgeoisie in the leadership of 
the Reform League to campaign for the demand for universal 
suffrage. After beginning in London, the movement gradually 
gained strength, spreading to the provinces, and its powerful 
dimensions gave Marx grounds for hoping that it would be 
successful. 'If we succeed in re-electrifying the political movement 
of the English working class,' he wrote to Engels on 1 May 1865, 
'our Association will already have done more for the European 
working class, without making any fuss, than was possible in any 
other way.' 
Using the influence of the International on British workers, 
Marx strove to give the reform movement a radical nature, to turn 
it into a national struggle for a democratic political system in 
Britain, to encourage workers to stand for their own political 
platform, regardless of the position of the bourgeois parties (see 
Marx's letters to Kugelmann of 23 February 1865 and 9 October 
1866,  to Engels of 13 May 1865, and others). In this connection 
the drawing into the struggle for reform of those strata of British 
trade union workers who had previously been indifferent to 
politics both pleased Marx and encouraged high hopes. 'We have 
succeeded in attracting into the movement,' he wrote to Ludwig 
Kugelmann on 15 January 1866, 'the only really big workers' 
organisation, the English "Trade Unions", which previously 
concerned themselves exclusively with the wage question.' 
The reform movement did not yield the expected results, 
however. The unity of its supporters was undermined by the 
bourgeois radicals who renounced the League's original pro-

XXIV Preface 
gramme calling for universal suffrage. After having come 'to a 
compromise with the bourgeoisie' (Marx to Johann Philipp Becker 
of 31 August 1866), the reformist trade union leaders began 
playing up to the radicals. This enabled the ruling circles in 
Britain to limit themselves to introducing a moderate reform in 
1867 that extended the franchise to the top strata of the working 
class only. The need to assert a truly proletarian world outlook 
and principles of revolutionary tactics of the proletariat, to counter 
reformist ideology and practice had now become even more 
evident. It was to this end that the subsequent activity of Marx 
and his associates in the International in Britain was directed. 
As can be seen from their correspondence, Marx and Engels 
focused their attention also on the prospects for the development 
of the German working-class movement. As Corresponding 
Secretary for Germany on the General Council, Marx hoped that 
the German proletariat would become one of the leading national 
detachments of the International Association. The objective 
prerequisites for this existed. The activity of the Communist 
League and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung during the revolution of 
1848-49 prepared the ground for the dissemination of the ideas of 
scientific socialism in Germany. However, the propagation of these 
ideas and the principles of the International came up against 
serious obstacles there. Reactionary legislation prevented the 
formation of the sections of the International. On the other hand, 
the very ideas of the international class solidarity of workers 
encountered resistance from Ferdinand Lassalle's followers, who 
had inherited his sectarian dogmas and nationalistic approach to 
the working-class movement. 'As long as these abominable 
Lassalleans rule the roost in Germany, that country will be infertile 
ground for the "International Association",' Marx wrote to Engels 
on 13 February 1865. 
A number of Marx's and Engels' letters written shortly after 
Lassalle's death in 1864 contain an assessment both of his 
services to the cause of the liberation of the German working-class 
movement from the tutelage of the liberal 'patrons' (Schulze-
Delitzsch and others) and of the harm that his mistaken views and 
tactics had done to the development of the class consciousness of 
the German workers. In a letter to Kugelmann of 23 February 
1865 and a number of other letters, Marx noted that Lassalle did 
not understand the real conditions for the liberation of the 
working class, had only a superficial knowledge of the ideas of

Preface XXV 
scientific socialism, and tended to vulgarise economic theory. In 
campaigning for the solution of the social question by setting up 
producer associations with state help, Lassalle was fostering the 
illusion of the 'social mission' of the reactionary Prussian 
monarchy (see this volume, p. 101). At the same time he denied 
the expediency of the economic struggle of the working class and 
opposed the creation of trade unions, the true centres of 
organisation of the workers. By orienting the latter towards 
attaining their goals by reformist means, Lassalle began the 
opportunist trend in the German working-class movement. 
In a number of letters Marx and Engels criticised Lassalle's 
political tactics. They condemned the absolute importance that he 
attached to the demand for universal suffrage, which he proc­
laimed as the most effective way of liberating the proletariat. The 
example of Bonapartism in France enabled them to foresee the 
demagogical use of this demand by the Prussian counter­
revolution. They also strongly condemned Lassalle's policy of 
flirting with Bismarck and his attempt to form an alliance with the 
Prussian Junkers against the bourgeoisie, particularly after they 
learnt of Lassalle's direct negotiations with the head of the 
Prussian government. 'Objectively it was the act of a scoundrel, 
the betrayal of the whole workers' movement to the Prussians,' 
Engels wrote to Marx on 27 January 1865. 
In opposition to the Lassalleans, Marx and Engels sought to set 
the German working-class movement on the revolutionary path. 
They attached great importance to bringing the General Associa­
tion of German Workers, founded by Lassalle in 1863, into the 
International (see Marx's letter to Carl Siebel of 22 December 
1864).  The Association had many healthy proletarian elements 
within its ranks, including former members of the Communist 
League, and Marx hoped that if the General Association of 
German Workers joined the International this would be an 
important step towards overcoming Lassalleanism and that eventu­
ally it would be possible radically to reshape this organisation, to 
change its programme and tactics and also its organisational 
principles. However, the Lassallean leaders of the Association 
opposed its joining the International. 
In the struggle against the influence of Lassalleanism on the 
German working-class movement an important part was played by 
Engels' pamphlet The Prussian Military Question and the German 
Workers' Party published in Germany in February 1865. Marx and 
Engels discussed its plan and content in detail in their letters. In 
them they denounce the social demagogy of the Prussian

XXVI Preface 
government and Bismarck's use of the Bonapartist tactics of 
manoeuvring between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, reveal 
the inconsistency and cowardice of the bourgeois opposition Party 
of Progress and determine the tasks of the working class in the 
struggle for democratic transformations in Germany (see, for 
example, Marx's letters to Engels of 3, 10 and 18 February 1865). 
The ideas expressed in their letters were developed in the 
pamphlet, in which Engels stressed that the main thing in the 
tactics of the working class was to avoid compromise with reaction, to 
denounce the anti-revolutionary role of the bourgeoisie and to 
pursue the policy of creating an independent proletarian party. 
An important milestone in the break by Marx, Engels and their 
supporters with the Lassalleans was the cessation of their 
short-lived cooperation on the Berlin Social-Demokrat. The letters 
of Marx and Engels reflect their relations with this newspaper of 
the General Association of German Workers quite fully. By 
agreeing to contribute to it, Marx and Engels hoped to influence 
the German working-class movement in the spirit of the principles 
of the International, and later Marx intended to make use of the 
Social-Demokrat to propagate the ideas of Capital. On 
14 November 1864 he wrote to Engels: 'It is important for us to 
have a mouthpiece in Berlin, especially for the sake of the 
association I was involved in founding in London, and for the sake 
of the book I am planning to publish.' However, the Social-
Demokrat' s servile attitude to Bismarck's government and the cult 
of Lassalle that was blown up out of all proportions in its columns 
caused Marx and Engels to review their decision. Convinced that, 
in spite of their warnings, the newspaper's editor Schweitzer was 
still trying to justify the policies of the Prussian ruling circles and 
to sing the praises of Lassalle, they both announced publicly 
that they refused to contribute to it (pp. 96-97, 98-99, 104-05, 
etc.). 
After the break with the Social-Demokrat Marx and Engels 
continued to strengthen contacts with the German workers, relying 
on the progressive elements who were disillusioned with Lassalle's 
dogmas and the tactics of making advances to government circles, 
and helped a considerable section of the German proletariat to 
part company with Lassalleanism. 
Marx and Engels gave constant support to Wilhelm Liebknecht 
and later to August Bebel in their struggle to consolidate the 
forces of the German working class on a revolutionary basis, on 
the platform of the International. This help was particularly great 
at the time when the question of the ways of the national 

=====第25页=====
Preface XXVII 
unification of Germany was being decided and circumstances 
demanded that German proletarian revolutionaries should put up 
a firm challenge to Bismarck's policy of uniting the country from 
above, under the supremacy of Prussia, by opposing to it the 
policy of revolutionary democratic unification from below. At that 
juncture, as Marx and Engels frequently stressed in their letters, it 
was most important to denounce the militaristic regime of the 
united state being created by Bismarck, to support democratic 
demands and to rally militant detachments of the German 
proletariat on a national level (pp. 297-98, 300, etc.). Marx and Eng­
els expressed their warm approval of Liebknecht's speeches criticis­
ing the policies of the Prussian ruling circles from the tribune of 
the North German Reichstag to which he was elected with Bebel 
in 1867. 'Liebknecht is doing very well,' Engels wrote to Marx on 
13 October 1867 concerning one of the denunciatory speeches by 
this true parliamentarian of the working class. The activity of 
Liebknecht, Bebel and their supporters, the creation of German 
sections of the International, the increasing influence of its ideas 
among the German workers, and the growing opposition to the 
Lassallean leadership in the ranks of the General Association of 
German Workers—all this inspired Marx and Engels with the 
conviction that the working-class movement in Germany would 
take the path of revolutionary struggle and master the principles 
of scientific socialism. 
Seeking to consolidate the position of the International in 
France, Marx did his utmost to counter the claims of bourgeois 
republicans to leadership of its local organisations. To this end, on 
his initiative the Central Council adopted decisions on the conflict 
in the Paris section (see Marx's letters to Engels of 25 February 
and 7 March 1865 and to Hermann Jung of 13 March 1865). At 
the same time Marx was constantly searching for ways of 
overcoming the belief of a section of French workers in Utopian 
Proudhonist doctrines. This is why in the letters published in this 
volume so much space is devoted to criticism of Proudhon's 
petty-bourgeois views that had a perceptible influence during this 
period not only on the French, but also on the Belgian and to 
some extent on the Swiss working-class movement. A generalised 
criticism of Proudhon's views was provided by Marx in his letter to 
Kugelmann of 9 October 1866 where he sums up the results of 
the Geneva Congress at which the difference between Proudhon's 
views and the revolutionary line of the leadership of the 
International became particularly evident: 'Beneath the cloak of

XXVIII Preface 
freedom and anti-governmentalism or anti-authoritarian individual­
ism these gentlemen, who for 16 years now have so quietly 
endured the most wretched despotism, and are still enduring it, 
are in actuality preaching vulgar bourgeois economics, only in the 
guise of Proudhonist idealism!' 
Analysing the causes of the spread of Proudhonist Utopias, 
Marx points to Proudhon's 'pseudo-critique' of the bourgeois 
system, to his outwardly radical phraseology that impressed the 
'jeunesse brillante' (brilliant youth) and students, and also the 
backward, semi-artisan strata of workers engaged in small-scale 
production (p. 326). Marx strongly condemns the Proudhonists 
for their disparaging attitude to 'all revolutionary action, i.e. arising 
from the class struggle  itself,  every concentrated social movement, 
and therefore also that which can be achieved by political means 
(e.g., such as limitation of the working day by law)' (ibid.). In a 
letter to Engels of 20 June 1866 Marx describes the sharp reproof 
which, in the course of a discussion on the Austro-Prussian war of 
1866,  he delivered to a number of French members of the 
General Council of the International who were seeking in a spirit 
of Proudhonist nihilism to call nations and nationalities 'obsolete 
prejudices'. 
Marx's letters in this volume also show what importance he 
attached to the setting up of sections of the International in 
countries like Belgium (see his letters to Léon Fontaine of 
15 April and 25 July 1865) and Switzerland (see his letters to 
Johann Philipp Becker of 13 January, Kugelmann of 15 January 
1866 and others). For propagating the principles of the Interna­
tional Working Men's Association and founding its sections in the 
USA Marx made use of contacts with Joseph Weydemeyer, Sigfrid 
Meyer and other participants in the European revolutionary 
movement who emigrated to America. Marx and Engels followed 
closely the development of the working-class movement in the 
USA, noting each of its successes with pleasure. Thus, Marx rated 
the results of the workers' congress in Baltimore very highly: 'The 
watchword there was organisation for the struggle against capital, 
and, remarkably enough, most of the demands I had put up for 
Geneva were put up there, too, by the correct instinct of the 
workers' (p. 326). 
During this period Marx and Engels paid great attention to 
drafting the platform of the International on the national

Preface XXIX 
question. They substantiated the tactics of the international 
proletarian organisation in relation to the national liberation 
movement, regarding the support of the working class for the 
liberation struggle of the oppressed nations as one of the most 
important conditions of its own liberation. The correspondence of 
Marx and Engels reveals how much energy Marx spent on 
organising public meetings and gatherings in defence of the 
fighters for Poland's independence. Unlike the Proudhonists, the 
leaders of the International regarded the demand that Poland 
should be reorganised on a democratic basis as an integral part of 
the struggle for the democratic transformation of Europe, in 
which the working class had a vital interest. Marx's consistently 
internationalist standpoint on the Polish question was also re­
flected in his polemic with the English radical journalist Peter Fox, 
one of the leaders of the British National League for the 
Independence of Poland. Although supporting Poland's national 
sovereignty, Fox shared the Francophile attitudes of the English 
radicals and the illusions of the Right bourgeois-aristocratic wing 
of the Polish national movement concerning 'assistance' to it from 
the ruling circles of the Western powers (see Marx's letters to 
Engels of 10 December 1864, 25 February and 4 March 1865, to 
Jung of 13 April 1865, and others). In his polemic with Fox Marx 
argued that the Polish revolutionaries should look not to the 
Western powers, who had treacherously betrayed the interests of 
insurgent Poland, but to the European proletariat, its true and 
selfless ally. 'In the opinion of Marx and Engels, the prime role in 
the liberation of Poland should be played by the united efforts of 
the representatives of the Polish national liberation and Russian 
revolutionary movements, their joint struggle against the common 
foe—Tsarist autocracy. 
An important contribution to the elaboration of the national and 
colonial question and the substantiation of the principles of 
proletarian internationalism was made by Marx and Engels in 
connection with determining the International's position on the 
liberation struggle of the Irish people. Their letters that deal with 
this problem formulate a number of fruitful ideas concerning the 
interdependence and inter-connection of the national liberation 
and proletarian movements. The national liberation of Ireland 
and the revolutionary democratic transformation of its agrarian 
structure was regarded by Marx as an essential prerequisite for 
the successful development of the British proletarian movement 
and for ridding the British workers of reformist and chauvinistic 
prejudices. In his letters to Engels of 2 and 30 November 1867, he 

=====第28页=====
XXX Preface 
set out the basic demands of his proposed programme on the Irish 
question, which he trusted would receive the support of the 
British working class. The main ones were: Irish self-government 
and independence from Britain, an agrarian revolution and the 
introduction of protective tariffs to ensure the country's economic 
independence. Noting that the British ruling classes had virtually 
established colonial rule in Ireland, introducing the practice of 
'clearing' estates, i.e. evicting Irish peasants from the land in the 
interests of English landlords and capitalists, Marx in a letter to 
Engels described this as a blatant manifestation of national 
enslavement mixed with social oppression: 'In no other European 
country has foreign rule assumed this form of direct expropria­
tion of the natives' (p. 461). 
On the initiative of Marx the General Council of the Interna­
tional conducted a campaign of support for the Irish people, while 
Marx himself in his public statements constantly defended the 
fighters for Irish independence, the Fenians. He stressed that the 
activity of these petty-bourgeois revolutionaries reflected the 
protest by the mass of the peasantry against the policy of eviction 
from the land, and also the discontent of the urban poor with the 
colonial regime. Describing Fenianism, Marx pointed out that it 
'is characterised by socialist (in the negative sense, as directed 
against the appropriation of the soil) leanings and as a lower 
orders movement' (p. 486). 
At the same time Marx and Engels were clearly aware of the 
weaknesses of Fenianism and emphasised that conspiratorial, 
adventurist tactics, and the use of terroristic methods of struggle 
did harm to the national liberation movement and prevented the 
establishment of international unity of action between the British 
proletariat and the Irish working people (see Marx's letters to 
Engels of 28 November and 14 December 1867 and of Engels to 
Marx of 29 November and 19 December 1867). 
Commenting on the importance of the struggle to liberate 
Ireland and the participation of English workers in this strug­
gle expressed in the letters of Marx and Engels, Lenin wrote in 
1914:  'In the Irish question, too, Marx and Engels pursued a con­
sistently proletarian policy, which really educated the masses in 
a spirit of democracy and socialism. Only such a policy could 
have saved both Ireland and England half a century of delay 
in introducing the necessary reforms, and prevented these re­
forms from being mutilated by the Liberals to please the reac­
tionaries' (V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 20, Moscow, 1977, 
pp. 441-42).

Preface XXXI 
The correspondence of Marx and Engels illustrates Marx's truly 
colossal work on his main life's work, Capital. In a number of cases 
letters alone enable us to ascertain precisely what problems of 
economic theory were of interest to him at this or that point in 
time,  to date the different preliminary versions of Capital and to 
determine the nature of non-extant manuscripts. From the letters 
we can get an idea of the way in which Engels helped Marx 
during the writing of Capital, of their constant exchange of views 
on problems of political economy, and of Engels' part in collecting 
factual material, determining the specific features of capitalist 
production and the influence of the economic situation, crises, 
etc., on it (see, for example, Engels' letters to Marx of 12 April 
1865,  26 and 27 August 1867 and others). 
Aware of the role that his work would have to play in the 
development of scientific socialism and the proletarian movement, 
Marx devoted all his energies to it, 'studying by day and writing by 
night'. 'I have not an hour to spare,' he wrote during this period 
(pp. 263 and 214). Marx hoped to 'deal the bourgeoisie a 
theoretical blow from which it will never recover' (letter to Carl 
Klings of 4 October 1864). Explaining to Ludwig Kugelmann the 
reasons for his refusal to attend the Geneva Congress of the 
International, Marx wrote on 23 August 1866: 'I consider that 
what I am doing through this work is far more important for the 
working class than anything I might be able to do personally at 
any congrès quelconque [congress whatsoever].' 
In January 1866 Marx began to prepare Volume One of Capital 
for publication on the basis of the manuscripts of 1863-65. At first 
he assumed that it would contain the first two books 'The Process 
of Production of Capital' and 'The Process of Circulation of 
Capital', but already in the course of the work he decided that it 
would contain only the first book. And although he himself wrote 
that he had begun recopying it and 'polishing the style' (Marx to 
Engels of 13 February 1866), much more than that was involved. 
Some chapters were considerably expanded by introducing new 
material. Thus, for the sections on the working day, machinery 
and the general law of capitalist accumulation, Marx made 
extensive use of factual data in the recently published Blue Books 
(containing the reports of parliamentary commissions, such as the 
Children's Employment Commission), about which he informed 
Engels on 21 July 1866 and in a number of other letters (p. 296). 
The extreme exhaustion resulting from his scientific work and 
the performance of his numerous duties as a leader of the 
International and the constant material hardships had a serious

XXXII Preface 
effect on Marx's health. As can be seen from many letters, the 
preparation of the manuscript of the first volume of Capital for 
the publishers was frequently interrupted by acute bouts of ill 
health which forced Marx to put aside the work. 'Dear Mr 
Kugelmann, you can believe me when I tell you there can be few 
books that have been written in more difficult circumstances,' 
Jenny Marx confided in Kugelmann in a letter of 24 December 
1867,  'and I am sure I could write a secret history of it which 
would tell of many, extremely many unspoken troubles and anxieties 
and torments' (p. 578). Nevertheless, in November 1866 Marx 
was able to send the first part of the manuscript to Hamburg, and on 
2 April 1867 he informed Engels that he had completed the book 
and would take the manuscript to the publisher himself in a few days' 
time. 
The Marx-Engels correspondence from May to August 1867 
reflects the work of proof-reading the first volume. Marx 
systematically sent sheets of print to his friend in Manchester. 
Thus Engels was the first reader and most competent reviewer of 
Marx's great masterpiece. After reading the greater part of it, he 
congratulated the author on elucidating the most complex 
economic problems 'simply and almost sensuously merely by 
arranging them suitably and by placing them in the right context' 
(p. 405). 'The theoretical side is quite splendid,' Engels remarked 
in his letter of 1 September 1867, adding: 'The résumé on the 
expropriation of the expropriators is most brilliant and will create 
quite an effect.' 
At the same time Engels made certain suggestions for improving 
the structure of the book and expounding a number of questions. 
In this respect, his letters to Marx of 16 and 26 June and 
23 August and Marx's letters to Engels of 3, 22 and 27 June and 
24 August 1867 are of considerable interest. Taking account of 
Engels' suggestions, Marx wrote a special appendix on the form of 
value. 
Marx greatly appreciated Engels' opinion of Capital. He wrote: 
'That you have been satisfied with it so far is more important to me 
than anything the rest of the world may say of it' (p. 383). A striking 
document revealing the collaboration between the two great thinkers 
and revolutionaries, and a moving testimony to Marx's profound 
gratitude to his friend, is Marx's letter to Engels written on 
16 August 1867 at 2.0. a.m. when he had just finished correcting the 
last sheet of Volume One of Capital. 'So, this volume is finished. 
I owe it to you alone that it was possible! Without your  self-
sacrifice for me I could not possibly have managed the immense

Preface XXXIII 
labour demanded by the 3 volumes. I embrace you, full of 
thanks!' 
The publication of Volume One of Capital (September 1867) 
became an outstanding event in the history of human thought. As 
Lenin said, in his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy 
and particularly in Capital Marx 'revolutionised' political economy 
(V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 21, Moscow, 1978, p. 49). 
Volume One of Capital contains a thorough analysis and 
explanation of the essence of capitalist exploitation, reveals and 
expounds the economic laws of the motion of bourgeois society 
and shows the inevitability of capitalism being replaced by a new 
social system as a result of a revolution carried out by the working 
class.  In this work Marx gave the proletariat a mighty ideological 
weapon in its struggle for the socialist transformation of society. 
'Marx's economic theory alone has explained the true position of 
the proletariat in the general system of capitalism,' stressed Lenin 
(Collected Works, Vol. 19, Moscow, 1977, p. 28). History has 
confirmed the correctness of Marx's comparison of Volume 
One of Capital with 'the most terrible missile that has yet been 
hurled at the heads of the bourgeoisie (landowners included)' 
(p. 358). 
The letters included in this volume also deal with the steps 
taken by Marx and Engels to popularise Volume One of Capital 
and its main ideas. On 27 April 1867 Engels wrote to Marx: 'I am 
convinced that the book will create a real stir from the moment it 
appears, but it will be very necessary to help the enthusiasm of the 
scientifically-inclined burghers and officials on to its feet and not 
to despise petty stratagems.' To attract attention to Capital Marx 
and Engels sent copies to their comrades and acquaintances, 
circulated notices through the publisher Otto Meissner announc­
ing its publication, wrote reviews for various press organs and 
published extracts from the preface to Volume One in various 
periodicals. 
Engels played a most important part in propagating Volume 
One of Capital. In order to thwart a possible 'conspiracy of silence' 
by bourgeois scholars, Engels suggested attacking 'the book from 
the bourgeois point of view'. Marx fully approved of his friend's 
plan, describing it as 'the best tactic' (p. 427). 
Engels prepared a series of brilliantly written reviews for liberal 
and democratic newspapers (see present edition, Vol. 20). Their 
publication made it impossible for bourgeois ideologists to ignore 
Capital and helped to expose attempts to belittle the importance 
of Marx's work and distort its content. 

=====第32页=====
XXXIV Preface 
However, the main aim behind all the efforts by Marx and 
Engels to disseminate and propagate Capital was to equip the 
working-class movement with a revolutionary economic theory, to 
introduce workers to truly scientific ideas concerning ways of 
getting rid of capitalist exploitation. It is no accident that in his 
letter of 30 November 1867 Marx asked Kugelmann to explain to 
Liebknecht 'that it really is his duty to draw attention to my book 
at workers' meetings'. Engels in his turn wrote to Hermann Meyer 
on 18 October 1867: 'I hope you will be able to bring Marx's book 
to the attention of the German-American press and of the 
workers. With the 8-hour-agitation that is in progress in America 
now, this book with its chapter on the working day will come at 
just the right time for you over there, and, in other respects too, it 
is likely to clarify people's minds on a variety of issues.' Other 
letters in this volume also testify to the true party concern for the 
working-class movement and the practical application of the 
conclusions of Marx's economic theory. 
The correspondence of Marx and Engels for this period shows 
what great importance they attached to the publication of Capital 
in other languages. Already on 31 July 1865, when the book was 
only being prepared for publication, Marx expressed the idea of 
making an English translation straightaway from the proofs of the 
German text. Subsequently, Marx and Engels returned frequently 
to the discussion of this question, looking for a translator and a 
publisher (see Engels' letters to Marx of 24 June and 23 August 
1867;  Marx's letters to Engels of 27 June and to Kugelmann of 
11 October 1867 and 6 March 1868). Unfortunately, the English 
edition of Volume One of Marx's main work did not come out 
during his lifetime. 
At the same time efforts were made to prepare a French 
translation of Volume One. Marx believed that a French edition of 
Capital would help the French workers to realise how invalid 
Proudhon's reformist projects were for solving the social question. 
'I consider it to be of the greatest importance to emancipate the 
French from the erroneous views under which Proudhon with his 
idealised petty-bourgeoisie has buried them,' he wrote to Ludwig 
Büchner on 1 May 1867. The search for a translator and 
publisher, as several letters show (including those of Marx to 
Engels of 28 November 1867 and to Victor Schily of 30 November 
1867),  turned out to be no easy matter in this case too. Marx was 
not able to realise his intention of bringing out a French 
translation of Volume One of Capital until 1872-75. 
The publication of Volume One of Capital was, as Marx 

=====第33页=====
Preface XXXV 
intended and the publisher insisted, to be followed by that of the 
two other volumes. Marx immediately set about revising his 
manuscripts of the second and third books of Capital, elaborating 
certain problems in greater detail as he went along. Thus, in his 
correspondence with Engels the question of the replacement of 
fixed capital is discussed (pp. 409-13); 'for the chapter on ground 
rent' (pp. 507-08) Marx asks Engels for help in selecting books and 
consultations on agro-chemistry, etc. 'We must keep a close watch on 
the recent and very latest in agriculture...,' he writes to Engels on 
25 March 1868. 
Marx showed a rare conscientiousness in his studies. Again and 
again he would return to what might appear to be sufficiently 
studied problems, making use of new material. This was one of 
the reasons for the delay in the preparation of the subsequent 
volumes of Capital. It was Engels who completed this task after 
Marx's death on the basis of Marx's manuscripts. 
A subject of constant attention for Marx and Engels during the 
period under review was not only the state and level of 
development of the working-class movement in different 
countries, but also the general economic and political position of 
these countries, and the international situation. All this had to be 
taken into account in elaborating the tactics of the international 
working-class movement at different stages. Therefore, many of 
the letters in this volume contain a description of the most 
important events that took place during these years in Europe and 
beyond the Continent, new phenomena in economics, including 
those related to the economic crisis of 1866, and in political life. 
Marx and Engels discussed with each other and their acquain­
tances the details of the struggle of the political parties in 
England, the symptoms of the imminent bankruptcy of the 
Bonapartist regime in France, the situation in Germany produced 
by the growing rivalry between Prussia and Austria, Prussia's 
victory in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the first steps to 
carry out Bismarck's plan for uniting the country by 'blood and 
iron'. The founders of Marxism made a thorough examination of 
the alignment of forces in the international arena, and of the 
positions of the European powers in the conflicts that followed 
one after another (the Luxemburg crisis of 1867, the international 
complications arising from the Rome expedition of Garibaldi and 
his followers, the Crete uprising, etc.) and testified to the growing 
danger of a new war. The assessments made by Marx and Engels 

=====第34页=====
XXXVI Preface 
of all these events are remarkable for their historical accuracy and 
depth. They were based on a dialectical-materialist analysis of the 
phenomena in question, which made it possible to reveal their 
class roots and essence, to expose the contradictory aspects, to 
determine the possible consequences and to conclude from this 
what tasks confronted the working class. 
Marx and Engels made a close study of the course of the US 
Civil War, which entered its final stage during this period. Their 
letters contain assessments of military operations and forecasts 
on the future development of events, a profound  " analysis of 
which enabled Marx and Engels to conclude that things were com­
ing to a head and that the economic, moral and political advan­
tages of the North would lead to the defeat of the slave-owning 
South. 
The revolutionising influence of the US Civil War on the 
development of the democratic and working-class movement was 
obvious to Marx and Engels. At the same time they also saw the 
limitations of the bourgeois democracy of the Northern states, and 
also the anti-democratic, sometimes downright counter­
revolutionary trends in the policies of the bourgeois ruling circles 
of the North. Criticising President Johnson, who succeeded 
Lincoln, Marx and Engels noted that his policies reflected the 
desire of the big bourgeoisie in the North to ally with the defeated 
planters of the Southern states, and to continue the system of 
racial discrimination against the 'liberated' Black people, etc. Engels 
wrote to Marx on 15 July 1865 that renewed hatred towards blacks 
was 'coming out more and more violently' and that Johnson 'is 
relinquishing all his power vis-à-vis the old lords in the South.... 
Without coloured suffrage nothing can be done, and Johnson is 
leaving it up to the defeated, the ex-slaveowners, to decide on that. It 
is absurd.' That is why when Johnson was defeated in the 1866 
elections Marx gave the main reason for this in a letter to François 
Lafargue in a single sentence: 'The workers in the North have at last 
fully understood that white labour will never be emancipated so long 
as black labour is still stigmatised' (p. 334). 
This statement by Marx is yet further confirmation that the 
events of his day, including questions of international politics, 
were seen by him and Engels primarily from the viewpoint of the 
interests of the revolutionary proletariat. Already during the 
founding of the International Marx called on the working class to 
proclaim its own independent policy opposed to that of the ruling 
classes. In his letter of 25 February 1865 to Engels he emphasised: 
'The working class has its own foreign policy, which is most 

=====第35页=====
Preface XXXVII 
certainly not determined by what the middle class considers 
opportune.' 
It was from this standpoint that Marx and Engels elaborated the 
tactics of the working class in connection with the growing threat 
of war in Europe. They condemned with severity the wars 
unleashed by the ruling classes for territorial, dynastic and 
anti-popular ends, and linked the struggle against such wars and 
against militarism in general with the liberation movement of the 
proletariat against the capitalist exploitatory system. It is no 
accident that when the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 broke out, 
Marx did his utmost to see that the International dissociated itself 
from the aggressive, expansionist tendencies introduced by the 
ruling circles of Germany and Italy into the struggle for the 
national unification of these countries, which was objectively 
progressive in the given historical situation. Marx and Engels saw 
these tendencies as a source of further aggravation of internation­
al contradictions, of fresh military conflicts. They predicted that 
the war of 1866 would be fraught with new, even more extensive 
military conflicts, first and foremost between Prussia and France. 
In a letter to Engels of 27 July 1866 Marx stressed that the end of 
the war would not lead to a lasting peace in Europe. 'That we shall 
soon be back to bashing is clear enough,' Engels replied to him on 
6 August 1866. All this required the further mobilisation of the 
forces of the working class for the struggle against the threat of 
war. 
Criticising the pacifist illusions of the bourgeois-democratic 
League of Peace and Freedom, Marx and Engels at the same time 
supported the idea of joint action by the working class with all 
truly anti-militarist forces prepared to stand up for peace between 
nations in deeds and not just in words. Guided by Marx the 
International tirelessly carried on an energetic struggle for peace, 
consistently denouncing the foreign policy and diplomacy of the 
ruling classes in the capitalist countries. 
From this volume it is clear that from 1864 to 1868 Marx and 
Engels continued to study the natural and social sciences, in 
particular world history, philology, ethnography and philosophy. 
Marx's letter to Engels testifying to Marx's interest in higher 
mathematics and his study of differential calculus was written at 
the end of 1865. In their letters Marx and Engels exchange views 
on books they have read, talk about discoveries in various spheres 
of science and assess new scientific hypotheses (see, for example, 

=====第36页=====
XXXVIII Preface 
pp. 7-8, 184-85, 212, 232, 291-92, 304-05, 320-25, 495, 547-49, 
557-59). 
Their letters show the leaders of the proletariat to be men with 
an extraordinarily wide range of interests, capable of discerning 
and assessing fruitful ideas and discoveries marking the steady 
advance of science. These discoveries, as Marx and Engels so 
rightly assumed, served as further proof of the correctness of the 
proletarian revolutionary world outlook and dialectical-materialist 
views on the development of nature and society. Thus, in the 
research on the social system of ancient and mediaeval Germany 
by the German historian Georg Maurer, Marx saw the 'Mark 
theory' as factual confirmation of the view, expressed earlier by 
Marx  himself,  that communal property in land came first, that 
everywhere it preceded the emergence of private property in land 
(see his letter to Engels of 14 March 1868). The striving of Marx 
and Engels to make full use of the latest achievements of the 
various sciences shows that Marxism, both during its formation 
and throughout its subsequent development, rested on the finest 
achievements of human thought. 
The biographical material contained in the letters in this volume 
gives a clear picture of the great thinkers and revolutionaries, and 
enables the reader to form a clear idea of the conditions in which 
they lived and struggled and the characteristic features of the 
theoretical and practical activity at the time when, after the 
founding of the International, they virtually became the leaders of 
the mass international proletarian movement. An important 
document in this respect that supplements the correspondence, is 
Marx's 'Confession' (answers to questions in a semi-humorous 
questionnaire) which reveals the richness and integrity of his 
personality (see Appendices). 
From the material in the volume it is clear that both Marx and 
Engels were extremely high-principled and unwavering on 
scientific and political questions, yet possessed the necessary 
flexibility in solving the urgent tasks of the working-class 
movement, and also that they were exceptionally modest and 
lacked any trace of personal vanity. Marx who frequently wrote 
that the whole burden of the leadership of the International lay 
virtually on him, stated in a letter to Liebknecht of 21 November 
1865 that he could not read out his report on the German 
working-class movement at the London Conference because, as he 
wrote, 'I was too personally introduced in it'. Resolute and 
high-principled in criticising the errors of friends and comrades, 
Marx and Engels were always ready to encourage and support

Preface XXXIX 
them and to come to their assistance. On 8 December 1864 Marx 
wrote to Engels: 'Apropos Liebknecht... I have sent him money 
several times in the course of the last six months and now I want 
to send his wife something ... since I know they are in dire straits. 
I would appreciate it if you would make a contribution, too.' 
Marx's service to the cause of the working class is exemplary. In 
a letter to Kugelmann of 9 October 1866, for example, he writes 
that if he were prepared 'to take up a practical trade' he could 
dispose of his pecuniary troubles entirely. But Marx never strove 
for personal well-being, although the hardships endured by his 
family caused him no little suffering. 'Working for the cause', for 
the party, for the liberation of the working class and the whole of 
the working people, that was Marx's aim throughout his life. 'I 
laugh at the so-called "practical" men and their wisdom,' he wrote 
on 30 April 1867 to Sigfrid Meyer, admitting what sacrifices the 
writing of Capital had cost him. 'If one wanted to be an ox, one 
could, of course, turn one's back on the sufferings of humanity 
and look after one's own hide. But I should really have thought 
myself unpractical if I had pegged out without finally completing 
my book....' And to his future son-in-law Paul Lafargue Marx 
wrote: 'You know that I have sacrificed my whole fortune to the 
revolutionary struggle. I do not regret it. Quite the contrary. If I had 
to begin my life over again, I would do the same' (p. 308). 
The letters in this volume supplement the works written by 
Marx and Engels in the period in question. They provide an 
important source for studying Marxist ideas and the creative and 
revolutionary biographies of Marx and Engels, and for elucidating 
their leading role in the development of the working-class 
liberation movement at the stage when the foundations of the 
international proletarian struggle for socialism were being laid.

Dear Friend, 
I was glad to receive further signs of life from the workers of 
the Rhine Province, as conveyed in your letter of 28 September.2 
B. Becker or M. Hess? I know them both; both are old members 
of the movement. Both are honest. Neither of them is capable of 
leading a movement of any import. Becker is a weak man, in fact, 
and Hess a muddle-head. It is therefore difficult to decide 
between the two. I also think it scarcely signifies which of the two 
you elect, as there will be no difficulty in finding the right people 
at the decisive moment. 
Enquiries have reached me, e.g. from Berlin, as to whether I 
would accept the presidency?3 I replied that it was impossible, 
because for the present I am still forbidden to take up residence 
in Prussia.b  However, I would certainly think it a good gesture by the 
party, vis-à-vis both the Prussian government and the bourgeoisie, 
if the workers' congress were to elect me, to which I would make a 
public reply explaining why I cannot accept the election. Such a 
step would be important for the following reason in particular: a 
big public MEETING of workers took place here in London on 28 
September, with English, German, French and Italian workers 
participating. The Parisian workers had, moreover, sent over a 
special delegation, headed by Tolain, a worker, who was put up as

At this MEETING, a Comité was elected — an international Comité to 
represent the workers' interests, which is directly linked to the 
workers in Paris and includes the leaders of the London workers. 
I was elected as representative of the German workers (and my 
old friend Eccarius, the tailor, along with me)." If I were thus 
nominated by the German congress—although I would have to 
decline the election now—the Comité and with it the workers in 
London and Paris would regard this as a gesture on the part of 
the German workers. Next year, the Comité will be calling an 
international workers' congress in Brussels. 5 Unfortunately, I shall 
not be able to attend in person, as I am still exiled from the model 
state of Belgium, just as I am from France and Germany. 
I shall send you some 'Manifestoes'b at the first safe opportunity.

I have been sick throughout the past year (being afflicted with 
carbuncles and furuncles). Had it not been for that, my work on 
political economy, 'Capital', would already have come out. I hope I 
may now complete it finally in a couple of months and deal the 
bourgeoisie a theoretical blow from which it will never recover.

London, 16 October 1864

Haverstock Hill 
My dear Countess, 
In recent weeks I have been so seriously ill that I was obliged to 
keep to my bed and hence, unfortunately, to defer until now my 
reply to your friendly letter of 1 October. 
I assure you that I still cannot bring myself to accept Lassalle's 
death as a fait accomplil I see him in my mind's eye so full of life, 
spirit, energy and plans, so very, very young, and now suddenly 
his voice is silenced and his breath departed—I find it impossible 
to reconcile the two, to conceive of both simultaneously, and the 
reality oppresses me like an awful, nightmarish dream. 
You are quite right to imply that no one appreciated Lassalle's 
greatness and significance better than I. He himself was most 
aware of this, as his letters to me show. As long as the 
correspondence between us lasted, I always expressed to him my 
heartfelt appreciation of his achievements, on the one hand, while 
always frankly advising him of my criticisms and reservations 
regarding those things I considered faulty, on the other. 
In one of his last letters to me he wrote, in that peculiarly 
forceful manner he had, of the satisfaction that this gave him. But, 
apart from all his abilities, I felt affection for him as a person. The 
pity is that we have always concealed this fact from one another, as 
if we were going to live for ever..."

Dear Engels, 
Your long silence worries me. I presume you are back.7 Why

I have all kinds of important things to tell you, which I shall do 
immediately as soon as you give some sign of life.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 2 November 1864 
Dear Moor, 
The crisis and its innumerable vexations must be my excuse for 
not writing to you earlier. Never in my whole life have I had such 
a glut of Jewish chicanery as now, and you can just imagine how 
much correspondence that entails. 
Later this week, I shall go and see Borchardt to complete the 
business of Lupus' legacy,8 which is now about to be concluded. 
My travels7  took me as far as Sonderburg 3; I did not go to 
Copenhagen, in part because I had neither the time nor a 
passport, and in part because Bille, the editor of the Dagbladet, 
a Danish name: Scriderborg.

had just arrived in Lübeck when I was in Kiel, and so I had no 
contact in Copenhagen at all, never having seen any of the other 
papers anywhere. 
Schleswig is a curious country—the east coast very pretty and 
prosperous, the west coast also prosperous, heath and moors in 
the middle. AH the bays extremely beautiful. The people are 
decidedly one of the biggest and heaviest of all the human races 
on Earth, especially the Frisians on the west coast. One only needs 
to travel across the country to be convinced that the main stock of 
the English comes from Schleswig. You know the Dutch Frisians, 
in particular those colossal Frisian women with their delicate white 
and fresh red complexions (which also predominate in Schleswig). 
They are the ancestral types of the northern English, and in 
particular those colossal women, who are also found here in 
England, all are of decidedly Frisian type. There is no doubt in 
my mind that the 'Jutes' (Anglo-Saxon eotena cyn), who migrated 
to England with the Angles and Saxons, were Frisians, and that 
the Danish migration to Jutland, as to Schleswig, dates only from 
the 7th or 8th century. The present Jutland dialect is proof 
enough of this. 
These fellows are great fanatics and, for that reason, really took 
my fancy. You must have read something by that extraordinary 
'Dr K. J. Clement of North Friesland'. The man is typical of the 
whole race. These fellows are in deadly earnest about their 
struggle against the Danes, which is their whole purpose in life, 
and the Schleswig-Holstein theory is not an end but a means for 
them. They regard themselves as a physically and morally superior 
race to the Danes, and indeed they are. Bismarck was really 
kidding himself when he thought he could get the measure of such 
people by his own methods. 9 We have held out against the Danes 
for fifteen years and became consolidated on our territory, and 
are we supposed to let these Prussian bureaucrats get us 
down?—that's what these fellows were saying. 
The situation regarding language and nationality is most 
bizarre. In Flensburg, where the Danes claim that the whole of the 
northern part is Danish, especially by the harbour, all the children, 
who were playing down by the harbour there in droves, spoke Low 
German. On the other hand, north of Flensburg the language of 
the people is Danish—i.e. the Low Danish dialect, of which I 
hardly understood a word. The peasants in the tavern at 
Sundewitt, 3 however, spoke Danish, Low German and High 
Danish name: Sundeved.

German by turns, and neither there nor in Sonderburg, where I 
always addressed the people in Danish, was I answered in any 
language but German. At all events, Germanisation has en­
croached considerably on North Schleswig, and it would be very 
difficult to make it entirely Danish again, certainly more difficult 
than German. I would rather it was more Danish, for one day 
something will surely have to be given up to the Scandinavians 
here,  for decency's sake. 
I have recently been doing some work on the philology and 
archaeology of the Frisians, Angles, Jutes and Scandinavians, and 
here,  too, I have come to the conclusion that the Danes are no 
more than a nation of advocates, who will knowingly and brazenly 
lie, even in matters of scholarship, if it is in their interest. Mr 
Worsaae  ON  THE DANES  ETC.  IN ENGLAND TO WIT.3  By way of contrast, next 
time you come here I will show you a book, which is in the main 
very good, by the lunatic Clement from North Friesland about 
Schleswig and the migration to England in the 6th to 8th 
centuries. b The fellow is certainly knowledgeable, despite his 
eccentricity. But he does appear to be a prodigious drinker. 
To my surprise, the Prussians in Schleswig created a very good 
impression, particularly the Westphalians, who looked like giants 
at the side of the Austrians, but admittedly much more 
ponderous. The whole army went around entirely unshaven, with 
their buttons undone and generally bearing themselves in a most 
unsoldier-like fashion, so that the natty Austrians acted almost like 
Prussians here. Amongst the officers of the Prussian artillery and 
engineers I encountered several very agreeable fellows, who told 
me all kinds of interesting things, but the infantry and cavalry 
maintained a most dignified reticence and enjoyed a thoroughly 
bad reputation with the population. There was a notable lack of 
enthusiasm for Prince Frederick Charles' conduct of the war, and 
no one at all, not even those who had been decorated, had a good 
word to say about the distribution of rewards. The non­
commissioned officers behaved well towards the older soldiers, 
and indeed generally when in company; on the other hand, I did 
see one of the Brandenburg sappers drilling recruits in Sonder­
burg, a real old infamous Prussian. It was, by the way, remarkable 
to observe the different tone that prevailed in the 3rd and 7th 
army corps in this respect. Your March Tribe, as Georg Jung has

it, submit to being kicked around and trampled on, whereas with

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS 10 
IN BARMEN 
Manchester, 2 November 1864 
Dear Hermann, 
No joy with the Niersteiner. The wine arrived here with a 
distinct sourness to it, it does not taste at all as it did at your 
house, and I shall therefore have to forgo any more orders. 
The money crisis, I think, is over. Now only 3 things can have 
any effect: 
1. possible major insolvencies owing to bad news from India. 
Such are, however, not expected by those most deeply involved. 
India had its crisis in the spring, when discount was at 32% in 
Bombay. 
2. large deliveries of cotton arriving in Liverpool, say 100,000 
bales in one week, which would mean the sudden completion of a 
mass of loss-making contracts and consequent insolvencies. This 
danger also appears to be receding. The Liverpool men know how 
deeply they are all implicated and are being extremely tolerant 
towards each other. Those who cannot pay the difference lost in 
a as an equal among equals

full are offering part of it, and a settlement is usually reached. 
Moreover, the deliveries arriving are moderate, and the cotton 
now at sea (400,000 bales from India and China) will probably 
come little by little, and no one will be hit very hard. 
A favourable factor in both cases is that the money market is 
experiencing a decided lift and confidence is returning. 
3. if in America Lincoln were not elected. However, his 
re-election is as certain as anything ever can be in America. I have 
no doubt that the war will be continued until the South is totally 
subjugated,11 irrespective of who becomes President, but if 
McClellan should be elected, at least 6 months of uncertainty 
would ensue, until people learned precisely what his policy was. 
But after the elections in the individual states, there can be no 
question of that happening. 
The result of all this will, in my view, be as follows: the 
American war will continue, certainly, until late next year, and will 
end with bands of Southerners resorting to brigandry, as in 
Naples 2 years ago,12 in the course of which much cotton will be 
burnt. We shall therefore remain dependent on the same sources 
for our cotton as in the past year. Supplies from these are only 
increasing slowly. However, since consumption has become more 
and more limited owing to high prices, stocks of finished goods, 
even in the hands of the individual consumers themselves, must 
now be exceedingly small, and as consumption after all absolutely 
requires a very large quantity of cotton goods, I believe that 
increased demand will fully accommodate the increased supply of 
raw cotton, and, consequently, not only will the downward trend 
cease to continue, but by next summer we ought, by and large, to 
see a general rise. 
During the money crisis the price of cotton was not determined 
by the state of the cotton trade but by the state of the money 
market in general. I believe we've got over that now, and prices 
will once more be determined naturally by supply and demand, 
and then with the healthy state of business and the absolute 
deficiency in stocks, and with prices lower now, I am sure we can 
expect business to thrive with prices as a whole rising. 
There may yet be sporadic shocks, perhaps from India, 
perhaps from Liverpool. We may, in consequence, again find 
ourselves momentarily somewhat depressed, but it cannot last, nor 
will it be of any import, and it would assuredly be an error to 
speculate à la baisse 2 on such evidence. Conversely, I am equally 
a on prices falling

6. Marx to Engels. 4 November 1864 11 
persuaded that any attempt to force prices up again rapidly would 
immediately be frustrated by the customers here and by the 
money market, too. This was already shown yesterday. Cotton has 
risen 3-3 1/2 d. above its lowest point, yarns Id., in some instances 
1 '^d. Yesterday, the spinners were demanding a further increase 
of approx. Id., and business 3 came to an immediate halt. If we 
succeed in forcing prices down another 1/2  PENNY à 1 PENNY in 
Liverpool, the spinners will be able to accept the prices being 
offered; otherwise, the purchasers will presumably have to pay the 
extra in the end, as the demand is undeniably there. 
SEWINGS were still very quiet, especially seven LEAS, for which there 
is not a buyer to be found. 
This is my opinion. We are covered for one to two months and 
are expecting substantial ORDERS in a week or two. 
Please pass on my regards to Emma, the little ones,  Rudolf, 
the Blanks and the Boellings, and, if you are writing to 
Engelskirchen, then to mother b and everyone there, too. The 
chicaneries arising from the fall in prices have caused me a deal of 
botheration.

until the day before yesterday, when yet another carbuncle 
appeared below my right breast. If the thing does not clear up 
quickly and others appear, I intend to use Gumpert's arsenic 
remedy this time. 
I would translate your runic rum hart, etc.a as Dutch-Frisian for 
open heart, clear horizon. But I fear that there may be a quite 
different explanation, so I give up the riddle. 
You must send all the  enclosed  papers back to me as soon as read. 
/ still need them. So that I do not forget any of the things I wanted 
to tell you, I am going to number them. 
1. Lassalle and Countess Hatzfeldt. 
The lengthy document is a copy of a circular that Herwegh's 
wife (honi soit qui mal y pense 0), Emma, sent to Berlin immediately 
after the catastrophe, 14 so that EXTRACTS from it could be put in the 
newspapers. You will see from it how cleverly Emma manages to 
put herself and her spineless Georg in the limelight at the 
beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the report; how the 
account evades two important points, firstly Rüstow's meeting with 
Dönniges and daughter, when the latter must have renounced 
Lassalle before the scene recounted by Emma took place. Secondly: 
how the duel came about. Lassalle wrote the insulting letter. But 
then something happened which is not reported and which led 
directly to the duel. 
The suppression of two such important and crucial points makes 
one sceptical of the accuracy of the account. 
The Hatzfeldt letter. On her arrival in Berlin I got Liebknecht to 
take her a brief letter of condolence from  myself.'  Liebknecht 
wrote to me d that she was complaining 'I left Lassalle in the lurch', 
as if I could have done the man any greater service than by 
keeping my mouth shut and letting him do as he liked. (In his last 
speech before the Düsseldorf assizes, he played the part of 
Marquis Posa with handsome William as Philipp II,e whom he was 
trying to persuade to suspend the present constitution, proclaim 
universal direct suffrage and ally himself with the proletariat.15) 
You can see what is behind her letter and what she wants of me. I 
wrote a very amicable but diplomatically discouraging letter in 
reply.1 The latterday Redeemer! That personage and the sycophants, 
who surround her, are mad.

Apropos.  A couple  of  NUMBERS  of E.  Jones' Notes  to the  People 
(1851,  1852)  happened  to fall into  my  hands again;  as far as the 
economic articles  are  concerned,  the  main points  in them  had 
been written directly under  my  guidance  and  partly even  in direct 
collaboration with  myself. 3 WELL! What  do I  find  in them? That  at 
that time  we  conducted  the  same polemic—only better—against 
the co-operative movement, since  it claimed,  in its  present 
narrow-minded form,  to be the  last  word,  as Lassalle conducted 
against Schulze-Delitzsch  in Germany  10-12  years later. 
In his  last will  and  testament Lassalle  has 'installed' Bernhard 
Becker,  the  unfortunate fellow,  who was  Juch's editor  on the 
Hermann  for a  while,  as his  successor  in the  office  of President  of 
the General Association  of German Workers 2—in his  'last will  and 
testament' (like  a ruling prince).  The  Association's congress meets 
in Düsseldorf this month, 16 and  strong opposition  to this 'decree' 
by last will  and  testament  is expected. 
Also enclosed, letter from  a worker  in Solingen, Klings, 2 in fact 
the clandestine leader  of the  Rhineland workers (former member 
of the  League "). This letter  is not to be  returned  but filed. 
2. WoRKINGMENS INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Some time  ago,  London workers sent  an address  to workers  in 
Paris about Poland  and  called upon them  to act  jointly  in the 
matter.b 
For their part,  the  Parisians sent over  a deputation headed  by a 
worker named Tolain,  who was the  real workers' candidate  in the  last 
elections  in Paris,4  a thoroughly nice fellow.  (His  compagnons were 
quite nice lads,  too.) A  PUBLIC MEETING in  St Martin's Hall was called, 
for 28 September 1864,  by Odger (shoemaker, President  of the local 
COUNCIL OF ALL LONDON TRADES' UNIONS and,  in particular, also  of the 
TRADES' UNIONS SUFFRAGE AGITATION SOCIETY, 18 which  is connected with 
Bright) and Cremer, a  MASON  and secretary of the  MASONS'  UNION. 
(These  two had  arranged  the big  TRADE-UNION MEETING  on North 
America chaired  by Bright  in St  James's Hall, ditto  the  Garibaldi 
manifestations.19 ) A certain  Le Lubez  was sent  to ask me if I  would 
participate pour les ouvriers  allemands,' 1 and, in  particular, whether  I 
was willing  to provide  a German worker  to speak  at the  MEETING, 
etc. I provided them with Eccarius,  who put on a  splendid 
a E. Jones,  'A Letter  to the  Advocates  of the  Co-operative Principle,  and to the 
Members  of Co-operative Societies', 'Co-operation. What  It Is, and  What  It Ought

performance,  and I was  also present myself  in a  non-speaking 
capacity  on the  PLATFORM.  I knew that  on  this occasion 'people  who 
really count' were appearing, both from London  and  from Paris, 
and I therefore decided  to waive  my  usual standing rule  to DECLINE 
ANY SUCH INVITATIONS. 
(Le Lubez  is a young Frenchman,  i.e. in  his thirties; however,  he 
grew  up in  Jersey  and  London, speaks capital English  and is a 
very good intermediary between  the  French  and  English workers.) 
(Music teacher  and  leçons"  OF FRENCH.) 
At the  MEETING,  which was chock-full (for  THERE  IS NOW  EVIDENTLY  A 
REVIVAL  OF THE WORKING CLASSES TAKING PLACE), Major Wolff (Thum-Taxis, 
Garibaldi's adjutant) represented THE  LONDON ITALIAN WORKINGMENS 
SOCIETY.20  It was resolved to found a  'WORKINGMENS INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION',  whose  GENERAL COUNCIL  is to  have  its  seat  in London 
and is to  'intermediate' between  the  workers'  SOCIETIES  in Germany, 
Italy, France,  and  England. Ditto that  a General  WORKINGMENS 
CONGRESS  was to be  convened  in  Belgium  in 1865. A  PROVISIONAL 
COMMITTEE  was  set up at  the  MEETING,  with Odger, Cremer  and  many 
others, some  of  them former Chartists, former Owenites,  etc., 
representing England, Major  Wolff,  Fontana,  and  other Italians 
representing Italy,  Le Lubez,  etc.  for  France, Eccarius  and  myself 
for Germany.  The  COMMITTEE  was  empowered  to  co-opt  as many 
people  as it  chose. 
So FAR so GOOD.  I attended  the  first meeting  of the  committee.  A 
Sub-Committee (including myself)  was set up to  draft  a déclaration 
des principes  and  provisional rules. 21 Indisposition prevented  me 
from attending  the  meeting  of the  Sub-Committee  and the 
subsequent meeting  of the  full committee. 
At these  two  meetings, which  I did not  attend,—that  of the 
Sub-Committee  and the  subsequent  one of the  full committee— 
the following occurred: 
Major Wolff  had  submitted  the  regulations (statutes)  of the 
Italian Workers' Associations (which possess  a central organisation, 
but, as emerged later,  are  essentially associated  BENEFIT SOCIETIES)  to 
be used  by the new  Association.  I saw the  stuff later.  It was  EVIDENTLY 
a concoction  of  Mazzini's,  and  that tells  you in  advance  in what 
spirit  and  phraseology  the  real question,  the  labour question,  was 
dealt with.  As  well  as how the  NATIONALITIES  question intruded 
into it.22 
What  is more,  an old  Owenite, Weston—now  a MANUFACTURER 
himself,  a very amiable  and  worthy man—had drawn  up a 
a lessons

programme full of extreme confusion and of indescribable 
breadth. 
The subsequent full committee meeting instructed the Sub-
Committee to remodel Weston's programme, ditto Wolff's REGULA­
TIONS.  Wolff himself left to attend the congress of the ITALIAN 
WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS in Naples and persuade them to join the 
central association in London. 
A further meeting of the Sub-Committee, which again I did not 
attend, as I was informed of their rendezvous too late. At this 
meeting, 'une déclaration des principes' and a revised version of 
Wolff's rules were presented by Le Lubez and accepted by the 
Sub-Committee for submission to the full committee. The full 
committee met on 18 October. Eccarius wrote to me that it was a 
case of periculum in mora," so I went along and was really shocked 
when I heard the worthy Le Lubez read out a fearfully 
cliché-ridden, badly written and totally unpolished preamble 
PRETENDING TO BE A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES, with MaZZUli showing 
through the whole thing from beneath a crust of the most 
insubstantial scraps of French socialism. What is more, the Italian 
rules had by and large been adopted, whose aim, apart from all 
their other faults, was really something quite impossible, a sort of 
central government of the European working classes (with Mazzini 
in the background, of course). I remonstrated mildly, and, after 
prolonged debate, Eccarius proposed that the Sub-Committee 
should subject the thing to further 'editing'. However, the 
'SENTIMENTS' expressed in Lubez' DECLARATION were carried. 
Two days later, on 20 October, Cremer representing England, 
Fontana (Italy) and Le Lubez met at my house. (Weston was 
unable to be present.) I had not previously had the papers (Wolff's 
and Le Lubez') in my hands, so could not prepare anything; but I 
was absolutely determined that  NOT  ONE  SINGLE LINE  of the stuff should 
be allowed to stand if I could help it. To gain time, I proposed 
that before we 'edited' the preamble, we ought to 'discuss' the RULES. 
This was done. It was 1 o'clock in the morning before the first of 
the 40  RULES  was adopted. Cremer said (and that was my whole aim): 
we have nothing to put before the committee that is to meet on 
25 October. We must postpone it until 1 November. But the 
Sub-Committee can meet on 27 October and attempt to reach a 
definite conclusion. This was agreed and the 'papers' were 
'bequeathed' to me for my perusal.

18 6. Marx  to Engels.  4 November  1864 
I could  see it was  impossible  to make anything  out of the  stuff. 
In order  to justify  the  extremely peculiar  way  in which  I intended 
to edit  the  SENTIMENTS  that  had  already been 'carried',  I wrote  AN 
ADDRESS  TO THE WORKING  CLASSES  a (which was not in the original plan; A 
SORT  OF REVIEW  OF THE  ADVENTURES  OF THE  WoRKING CLASSES  SINCE  184ô);  On the 
pretext that  all the  necessary facts were contained  in this 'Address' 
and that  we  ought  not to  repeat  the  same things three times over, 
I altered  the  whole preamble, threw  out the  déclaration  des  principes 
and finally replaced the 40  RULES  by 10. Insofar as  INTERNATIONAL 
POLITICS  is mentioned in the 'Address', I refer to  COUNTRIES  and not 
to NATIONALITIES,  and  denounce Russia,  not the  minores gentium}' 
The Sub-Committee adopted  all my  proposals.  I was,  however, 
obliged  to insert  two  sentences about  'DUTY'  and  'RIGHT',  and  ditto 
about  'TRUTH, MORALITY AND JUSTICE'  in the preamble to the rules, 0 but 
these  are so  placed that they  can do no  harm.23 
At the  meeting  of the  General Committee  my  'ADDRESS',  etc.,  was 
adopted with great enthusiasm  (UNANIMOUSLY).  The  debate  on the form 
of publication,  etc.,  is to  take place next Tuesday.0  Le  Lubez  has a 
copy  of the  'Address'  for  translation into French  and  Fontana  one 
for translation into Italian.  (For a  start there  is a  weekly  CALLED 
Bee-Hive," edited  by Trade Unionist Potter,  a sort  of Moniteur.)  I am 
to translate  the  stuff into German  myself. 
It was  very difficult  to frame  the  thing  so that  our  view should 
appear  in a  form that would make  it ACCEPTABLE  to the  present 
outlook  of the  workers' movement.  In a  couple  of weeks,  the  same 
people will  be  having  MEETINGS  on the  franchise with Bright  and 
Cobden.  It will take time before  the  revival  of the  movement 
allows  the old  boldness  of language  to be  used.  We  must  be fortiter 
in re,  suaviter  in  modo. 1 You  will  get the  stuff  as  soon  as it is 
printed. 
3. Bakunin sends  his  regards.  He  left today  for  Italy where  he is 
living (Florence).  I saw  him  yesterday  for the  first time  in 16  years. 
I must  say I  liked  him  very much, more  so than previously. With 
regard  to the  Polish movement,  he  said  the  Russian government 
had needed  the  movement  to keep Russia itself quiet,  but had not 
counted  on  anything like  an  18-month struggle. They  had  thus 
provoked  the  affair  in Poland. Poland  had  been defeated  by two 
things,  the  influence  of Bonaparte  and,  secondly,  the  hesitation  of

the Polish aristocracy in openly and unambiguously proclaiming 
peasant socialism from the outset.24 From now on—after the 
collapse of the Polish affair—he (Bakunin) will only involve 
himself in the socialist movement. 
On the whole, he is one of the few people whom after 16 years 
I find to have moved forwards and not backwards. I also discussed 
Urquhart's DENUNCIATIONS with him. (Apropos: the International 
Association will probably lead to a rupture between myself and 
these friends!2a) He inquired a great deal after yourself and 
Lupus. When I told him of the latter's death, he said straightaway 
that the movement had suffered an irreplaceable loss. 
4. Crisis. By no means burnt out on the Continent yet (esp. 
France). Incidentally, what the crises have lost in intensity, they 
have now gained in frequency.

Dear Moor, 
Your Frisian solution is quite right, but for one word. In North 
Frisian, Kimmang means: look, or eye; these North Frisians are of 
a speculative disposition and have substituted the inward horizon 
for the outward one, rather as Wagener is now calling for an 
'inward Düppel'. 27 It is an old sailors' saying. 
The Herwegh and Hatzfeldt papers returned enclosed. What 
was the further provocation you refer to which Lassalle inflicted 
on the Walachian a and was suppressed by Emmab? Lassalle's fatal 
error was obviously that he did not throw the hossyc straight on

the bed in the boarding house and deal with her appropriately, it 
was not his fine mind but his Jew's pizzle she was interested in. It 
is yet another of these affairs that only Lassalle could get involved 
in. That it was he, who forced the Walachian into the duel, is 
doubly crazy. 
Old Hatzfeldt's idea that you should write an apotheosis of the 
latterday Redeemer" is really priceless. 
The letter from the Solingen worker 5 was not enclosed. 
I cannot wait to see the Address to the Workers,' it must be a 
real masterpiece, to judge by what you tell me of the people 
involved. But it is good that we are again making contact with 
people who do at least represent their class, which is what really 
matters ultimately. The effect on the Italians will be particularly 
good, as there is some chance that this will at last put an end to 
this Dio e popolod among the workers—it will come as quite a 
surprise to the worthy Giuseppe.6 Incidentally, I suspect that there 
will very soon be a split in this new association between those who 
are bourgeois in their thinking and those who are proletarian, the 
moment the issues become a little more specific. 
Concerning Lupus' legacy, we had a meeting with the lawyer 
this morning.8 The sum still owing to you will amount to a little 
over £200; as soon as I have the money, I shall send most of it to 
you. There are still some details we do not know exactly, so we 
cannot finally calculate yet. The tax authorities want a list of all 
the books, and the exact value of the clock Lupus left. Please send 
me something itemising all the larger works and at the end just: so 
MANY PAMPHLETS ETC., everything IN ONE CLUMP. 
I must close now, as I have to go to a Directors' meeting of the 
Schiller Institute,28 of which I am chairman, as you know, to Mr 
Borchardt's annoyance. Happily, beer has been introduced. 
Kind regards to your wife and the girls.

Dear Moor, 
In respect of the legacy, 8 a further £200 enclosed in 2/2 à £100 
banknotes. All being well, there will be approx. £40 to come. I'll 
send the other two halves as soon as you telegraph receipt. 
You will have received the Dagblätter" with the celebrated article. 
Unfortunately, I could not find the 2nd section of the article, but 
there was not much in it. 
The end appears to be approaching at Richmond.90 However, as 
long as Lee is not obliged to stay entirely on the defensive, which 
in particular means pulling all his troops back from the 
Shenandoah Valley as well, and as long as Richmond is not 
completely encircled, all the advances Grant makes against the 
defences at Richmond or Petersburg will be of little importance. It 
is just as it was at Sevastopol, which was not encircled either.31  I 
cannot imagine what Monsieur de Beauregard will do, probably 
no more than Hood before him, if as much. I have no confidence 
at all in this much-vaunted hero. 
I am sending you yesterday's Guardian0 ; you must have a look at 
the RELIEF Committee's report in it, and see what a difference there 
is between Mr Marie's ateliers nationaux and those of your English 
gentlemen. 32 In the case of the former, tasks of doubtful utility 
were performed, but most of the money that was spent passed into 
the hands of the workers, who had lost their jobs. Here, tasks of 
similarly doubtful importance (but ultimately of definite utility to 
the bourgeoisie) were also performed, but of the £230,000 a mere 
£12,100 is going to pass into the hands of the FACTORY  OPERATIVES,  for 
whom the whole sum was intended (in other words, just that 
which is set down as being for UNSKILLED LABOUR). The ACT FOR THE 
RELIEF  OF THE DISTRESSED FACTORY  OPERATIVES  is thus turned into one  FOR  THE 
RELIEF OF THE UNDISTRESSED MIDDLE CLASSES, who thereby save on rates. 
All my regards.

Dear Engels, 
I have had to stay mainly in bed for almost a week on account of 
the carbuncle. The thing is now healing up. However, as the 
carbuncle is just below the breast, I still have trouble leaning 
forward in order to write. So, to keep it as brief as possible: 
1. Please send the enclosed letters addressed to me back to me 
(both the one from Schweitzer and the one from Liebknecht) and 
reply by return, as the people need our reply as soon as possible. 34 
My view is that we should promise occasional contributions from 
time to time. It is important for us to have a mouthpiece in Berlin, 
especially for the sake of the association I was involved in 
founding in London/ and for the sake of the bookb I am planning 
to publish. It is also important that whatever we do, we do it 
together. 
If you agree with me, you can send me a few lines for these 
chaps,  or say in a few lines what statement / am to make in your 
name. 
2. You will receive the 'ADDRESS' along with the 'PROVISIONAL RULES', 
etc., in a few days. The thing was not quite so difficult as you 
think, because we are dealing with 'workers' all the time. The only 
LITERARY MAN in the Association is the Englishman, Peter Fox, a 
writer and AGITATOR who is, at the same time, one of the people 
from The National Reformer (atheist but anti-Holyoake). I am

sending you the very kind note he passed on to me concerning the 
'ADDRESS'. Mazzini is RATHER DISGUSTED that his people are among the 
signatories, mais il faut faire bonne mine à mauvais jeu? 
3. Your stuff from the Guardianh I find most valuable. I had 
already pieced this abomination together from the 'FACTORY REPORTS', 
but only in a most laborious and fragmentary fashion. 
4. 2 COPIES received from the Manchester SOLICITOR for signing, 
etc. In a day or two, I shall send you the signed copies, along with 
the list (inventory), etc., which you will then have to record. Of 
course, I can no longer reel off a complete list of all the stuff we 
left in the flat, etc., and put a value on it.8

A few lines for Schweitzer enclosed.35  It is a very good thing 
that we shall again be getting a voice in the press; also very good 
that Liebknecht is going to be co-editor (as long as he is under no 
illusions); that does at least provide some safeguard. Meanwhile, 
we shall do better if we conceal our enthusiasm, as 1. Liebknecht 
is no diplomat, and one cannot rely too much on his CLAIRVOYANCE, 
2. the countess a will, above all, be trying to swamp the paper from 
beginning to end with a deliberate 'apotheosis',b  and 3. we really 
must find out first who else has been approached. Perhaps you are 
better informed than I am, but in the letters from Liebknecht you 
sent me there is no mention of the paper nor of this man 
Schweitzer, so I am very much in the dark. For that reason, I have 
asked for some clarification about the company we shall be seen to 
be keeping. We might after all find ourselves cheek by jowl with 
Mr Karl Grün or some such scum. 
And what a dreadful title: Der Socialdemokratl Why do these 
fellows not simply call it the Proletarier? 
Enclosed papers returned with thanks. Why haven't you sent the 
Solingen letter c you promised? 
Amid the nonsense written by Emma Herwegh,d  I notice there is 
a further attempt to turn Lassalle into a demi-god, as follows: only 
his mighty spirit kept him alive for so long, anyone else would 
have given up the ghost 2 hours after being wounded—but you 
ask Allen some time about the way peritonitis develops following a 
wound, and he will tell you inflammation hardly sets in at all 
within 2 hours, and is scarcely ever fatal in less than 24 hours, and 
usually not until much later. These people are really given to 
deification. 
Schaaffhausen in Bonn has given a pretty lecture on man and 
apes,  pointing out that Asiatic anthropoids have rounded heads, 
like the human beings there, but in Africa both are long-headed, 
and commenting that, with the present state of knowledge, this is 
the strongest argument against the unity of the human race. 
Someone ought to try saying that at a gathering of naturalists in 
England! 
It is splendid how Müller and the Rev. Cappell have made fools 
of that gang Kinkel, Juch & Co. even from the gallows. It is a long 
time since I have come across anything quite so absurd as the 
conduct of these fellows. How fortunate Gottfried c is in the people 
whose cases he takes up! First MacDonald, then Müller. And then

DEAR FRED, 
1. I am sending the stuff for the SOLICITOR. You will have to copy 
the enclosed inventory and put it into whatever shape you think 
fit.1 
2. Ad vocem h Solingen. I had put the letter out READY when I 
sent you the last but one letter-package, and it hasn't been 'seen 
any more since then'.' I suspect it has ensconced itself in a 
notebook and WILL TURN UP one fine morning. 
3. Ad vocem Schweitzer. 
Is a Dr of Law, formerly of Frankfurt am Main. Published a 
confused pamphlet against Vogt in 1859. d Subsequently, a social 
novel I have not read.e  Declared his vigorous support for Lassalle. 
Later, during Lassalle's lifetime, he got to know sundry writings of 
ours at Liebknecht's house while staying in Berlin and, even at 
that time, sent me a message through Liebknecht saying how 
amazed he was at finding that everything about Lassalle that he 
liked had been plagiarised.

I have written, like you, concerning the prospectus of contributors.^ 
Have sent Liebknecht German translation of the address of the 
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE at the same time, with a view to eventual 
publication in the paper. (The stuff will appear today or tomorrow 
and will be sent to you. a) 
As far as Lassalle's apotheosis is concerned,b  the Hamburg 
Nordstern, edited by that jackass Bruhn (who at the same time 
continues to print Heinzen's ELUCUBRATIONS, as though nothing had 
happened), is exclusively dedicated to this matter just as before, 
and the Social-Demokrat can scarcely compete with it in that 
respect. 
Old Hatzfeldt seems to be most disappointed by the letter I sent 
in reply to her 'ploy',c although it was most delicate and 
considerate in tone. Since that time, she has—kept silence. 
Social-Demokrat is a bad title. But there is no need to throw away 
the best tides immediately on things that may prove to be FAILURES. 
Wilhelm Liebknecht is an unquestionably big man among the 
Berlin workers, as you can see from the Berlin correspondence of 
The Morning Star. I am only afraid he will soon be sent packing. 
4. Ad voce m Peritonitis, it says in Andral: 'Clinique Médicale': 
'La Péritonite aiguë ... en certains cas un petit nombre d'heures 
s'écoulent entre l'époque de l'invasion de la maladie et celle de la 
mort, tandis que d'autres fois la péritonite, toujours aiguë par ses 
symptômes, ne devient mortelle qu'au bout de 30 à 40 jours.' e 
And under the rubric: 
'Péritonite par violence extérieure'1  he describes the case of a 
Parisian worker who was kicked in the stomach by a horse, in the 
region of his navel. Was only taken to the Charité g le surlende­
main,  'offre tous les symptômes d'une phlegmasie aiguë du 
péritoine"1  (later confirmed by ouverture du cadavre'). Died du 5-ème 
au 6-ème  jour, 1 and amongst the general  OBSERVATIONS  concerning this 
case,  it says: 'jusqu'au dernier moment, on n'observe aucun trouble 
des facultés intellectuelles et sensoriales.' k

... in some cases just a few hours elapse between the onset of the disease and death, 
whereas on other occasions peritonitis, which is always acute in its symptoms, does not 
cause death for from 30 to 40 days.' - f  'Peritonitis due to external violence' -

I have just been obliged to write long letter to the old womand 
to extricate myself from the Blind affair she has tried to involve 
me in. Student Blind has, of course, not let the opportunity slip by 
of puffing himself up, by issuing a 'protest' in the name of the 
Republic" and selecting a few passages from Lassalle's speeches 
which are indeed quite sickeningly royalist.44 Also to advise her 
against reproducing the 'wanted' portraits of her enemies.45

My dear Countess, 
I have just informed you by telegraph46  (to avoid all delay in 
reply) of my view that the two photograms of von R. et Co. a 
should, in no circumstances, appear together with Lassalle's in the 
pamphlet. It would, on the one hand, dishonour the deceased, 
and, on the other, give the publication a gaudy appearance which 
should be avoided completely. Furthermore, as you know, 'contra 
hostem vindicatio aeterna sit'b is my motto too, but, for revenge to 
be successfully executed, it is advisable not to initiate the public in 
one's vindictive 'intent'.45 
'Ex ossibus ultor'c would seem to me the best title for Lassalle's 
portrait. They were also my last words spoken at the graveside 
of my never-to-be-forgotten friend W.  Wolff 47 some six months 
ago. 
As regards ex-student  Blind,  that fellow who made himself 
known before 1848 by peddling Heinzen's nonsense and as the 
homme entretenu" 1 of the wife of the Jewish banker Cohen e (whom 
he later married in London), so I would ask you to remember that 
in my piece Herr Vogt (see pp. 58-69 and Appendices 9 and  11 )f I 
do not merely describe this student Blind as a 'deliberate liar', but I 
prove by reference to legal documents that this wretched man 
fabricated 'false witness' to cast suspicion on myself and to extricate 
his neck from a noose that this creature had made for himself for 
the purpose of merely making himself look big (which is indeed this 
rascal's sole purpose in every public step, or rather crawl, he 
undertakes).48 
Then Blind succeeded in deflecting the catastrophe of his 
a Janko von Racowija and Helene von Dönniges - b A paraphrase of an article 
from the Twelve Tables (a code of law of ancient Rome) which says: 'Adversus 
hostem aeterna auctoritas  [esto]'  (III, 7); Marx uses the word vindicatio in the sense 
of revenge. - c 'Let the avenger rise' (Virgil,  Aeneid,  IV, 625: 'ex oriare aliquis 
nostrius ex ossibus ultor'). - d kept man - e  Friederike Ettlinger, Cohen's and later

attention  of the  German public. 49 This appeared necessary  to me 
because  the  liberal press  in Germany instinctively took  the  side of 
a scoundrel like Blind,  and  therefore sought  to hush  up my attack. 
Lassalle considered Blind  too  insignificant.  It was  only later that 
he discovered that there  are  times when  one  cannot decline  a 
'combat with  a flea'.c 
When Lassalle  was  here  in London,50  he sought  to enlighten 
Louis Blanc  and  Mazzini about Blind  on his  personal visits  to 
them,  but in  vain.  The man is  exactly what Mazzini, Ledru,  etc., 
had hoped,  but  failed,  to find in the  other Germans  of standing,  a 
servile lackey  and  sycophant. Through  his  relations with these 
people  he makes  the  English think that  he represents Germany, 
and he impresses  the  Germans  by his boasting here. Yet the whole 
of this fellow's activity consists  in writing,  in conjunction with  3 or 
4 South Germans/ from,  for and about 'Karl  Blind'  and, at  every 
possible opportunity,  to force  on the  English, Germans  and 
Americans  his  'unofficial judgment'  as the  self-appointed rep­
resentative  of 'German republicanism'  (a party, which  is well known 
to exist only  on the  moon, since  the  German bourgeois  is 
interested  in a  constitutional monarchy,  the  feudal lord  in an 
aristocratic monarchy,  and the  worker  in general  not in  mere forms 
of state,  but in the  form  of state  as the  expression  of economic 
social conditions,  and, at all  events,  has  never recognised 
ex-student Blind  as  representative).  He is a  true master  of 
dictating letters  to one of his 6 satellites,51  in which they call  on the 
said, etc.,  'Karl Blind'  to do  this or that,  or congratulate  him on 
this or that,  and  then—by oversight  or OTHERWISE—the  replies from 
the same Karl Blind gain entry  to the  press. 
As one of the  'YOUNG  MEN'  who  were active  in the  service  of 
F. Hecker, Blind learnt that  art,  which  is by no  means rare among 
the South Germans,  of self-defamation  and  creating  a spurious 
PUBLIC  OPINION  about people who are essentially nonentities. In 
London  he thought himself  far  enough advanced along  the  road 
or to have served long enough  in the  'Democratic cause'  to

exploit for himself those arts he had acquired in the service of 
others. 
Regarding his education, it is, as I told Lassalle during his 
sojourn here, that of a Baden publican," who has read Rotteck's 
Weltgeschichte, Welker's Staatslexikon and Mr Struve's republican 
Almanac. b 
In his manoeuvres in Germany Mr Blind enjoys the particular 
support of Mr Gustav Rasch of Berlin. 
Bernhard Becker, as the former SUBEDITOR of the London 
Hermann, best knows how Blind composed with his own fair hand 
the paeans of praise to himself that appeared e.g. in the Hermann. 
He does this mostly and on average. By way of variation he will 
occasionally get a certain Dr Bronner in Bradford or his Schaible 
(see 'Herr Vogt') via London to put their names to his epistles. All 
the agitation of this person is nothing but a tissue of lies, 
self-deception and hot air. In this field, however, he has no rivals. 
He demonstrated the height of his dexterity when Garibaldi 
visited London. 19 He first spread the rumour in the English 
papers that he was an intimate friend of Garibaldi. Imposing 
himself as is his custom, he issued 'addresses' to Garibaldi from 
London and you know that in his kind-hearted naivety Garibaldi 
will write a nice letter back to anyone. Then he descends on the 
Isle of Wight (before Garibaldi made his ceremonial entry to 
London), and 'appoints' with him the date on which Garibaldi 
would receive the German deputation (Blind, you see, had so 
arranged things as to get a few Germans, including Kinkel and 
unfortunately my friend Freiligrath as well, to elect him as the 
leader of a deputation) and at the same time sends mysterious 
hints to some London papers c that Garibaldi WAS  CLOSETED'  WITH 'HIS 
FRIEND' (Blind) and, of course, settled some very important affairs 
of state with him.52 But Blind's masterstroke is still to come. As 
serving-man to the European 'kings of democracy"1 (for so he 
designates Mazzini, Ledru Rollin, Louis Blanc, and indeed COMPARED 
WITH student Blind even they are 'great men"), our Baden trickster 
manages so to arrange things that he, as a member of the society 
and a leader, fetches Garibaldi from the Duke of Sutherland's, 
where he is staying, and escorts him in the Duke's State Carriage

to Ledru Rollin  and  Louis Blanc.  He  seizes  the  opportunity  to 
have  the  carriage stand  for a  while outside  Mr  Blind's house  for 
Garibaldi  to  'PAY HIS COMPLIMENTS TO Madame Karl Blind'.  By skilful 
MANAGEMENT  all this even appears  in The  Times,"  and at the  moment 
when Garibaldi  is being idolized  by all  London. Perhaps  you  recall 
how 'Rameau',  the nephew,  in Diderot's wonderful piece, bursts 
out in admiration  at the  genius  of Bouret,  the  general  tax-
collector,  who  cunningly devised  a way to  disaffect  his  little  dog 
from himself  and  make  it prefer  the  minister! This Garibaldi-farce 
was Blind's Bouret-prank!  It is my  belief that from that time  on he 
began bona fide  to think himself  a great  man! He has  really  got 
hold of something with Schleswig-Holstein!  Did you not  know 
then that  for  years Blind  has  been deriving  his chief importance 
from acting  as a  'representative'  for  Schleswig-Holstein against 
Denmark, saying  'he' had  'forced'  the  German tyrants into  war 
against Denmark, 9 and  that  was why  friend Rasch dedicated  his 
piece about  the  'orphaned' kith  and  kin b to him! Did you not 
know that  in the  Prussian House  Prof.  Virchow (probably  at Mr 
Rasch's instigation) cited Blind's great influence  in the  Schleswig-
Holstein affair c as proof  of what  a single  man can do by his own 
efforts  for a  whole nation!  The  shameless  man had  made those 
German jackasses believe that  he had got the  English  to change 
their view  of Schleswig-Holstein!  His feeble leaflets about Schles­
wig-Holstein  are just about  (and  that  is saying something)  the  most 
stupid thing that  has  appeared  in this LINE. (Incidentally,  Mr 
ex-student's best friend  and  associate  is that lout Karl Heinzen  in 
America, whose business  for 20  years past  has  been  to slander  me 
in a manner such  as even Lassalle never experienced.  I have never 
thought  it worth  the  trouble  to reply  to this fellow,  but I was 
astonished that  the  Nordstern —for  a long time also  a major 
mouthpiece  for  student Blind—is constantly printing Heinzen's 
filth, which  is extremely hostile  to the  principles  of the  workers' 
party,  and  generally makes propaganda  for Mr  Heinzen.) 
But Garibaldi, Schleswig-Holstein, America, Lassalle,  all are for 
the ex-student only  a pretext  for  puffing  up his own self-
importance!  The  modest fellow wrote  in his own  fair hand  a short 
while  ago to the  'Glasgow Sentinel' that  the  whole  of Europe

(literally) was not yet divided into two hostile camps with regard to 
'Karl Blind', but that a tiers parti existed in this respect, too!a In 
The Observer  he describes himself  as 'THE  ILLUSTRIOUS CHIEF OF THE 
GERMAN  REPUBLICANS'. h 
A few more little touches to the description of this man, who, if 
one views him aright, is a highly comical character. 
After his success with Garibaldi MR  KARL  BLIND  JOINED  THE 
SHAKESPEARE COMMITTEE,53  as was  stated  in the  Athenaeum\c  He had 
now clearly progressed to the status of 'literary' representative of 
Germany, too! 
During the skirmish in Baden (1849),54 Struve, as he himself 
recounts in a piece about the 'Baden revolution',1 * sent the 'young 
man', as he calls Blind, as Under-Secretary to Schütz, who had 
been appointed Secretary, from Mainz to Paris, to rescue 
ex-student Blind from conflict with Brentano. The government to 
which Blind was directed as Under-Secretary to Secretary 
Schütz, — the provisional government no longer existed when Secretary 
and Under-Secretary arrived in Paris. Nevertheless, in mysterious 
hints in English papers, he let it be understood that he held an 
important diplomatic post as agent of the German 'republican 
government' in Paris! 
In the first few years after 1849 he lived in Belgium with his 
present wife. Since this woman has children from her marriage to 
the dead banker (and they inherited) and she also has children by 
Blind (at that time still illegitimate), a court in Baden ruled that 
Cohen's children should be taken away from his widow Cohen 
because of her 'immoral' relations with ex-student Blind. The 
court in Brussels gave this ruling legal force in Belgium, and this 
caused Blind to flee to England together with his wife and the 
children. He later got English papers to print (and was brazen 
enough to boast publicly of it on a visit to South Germany) that he 
had been expelled from Belgium for political reasons!e 
His next deed you will see from the enclosed cutting, which he 
had printed in many London papers. What provoked it was the 
report disseminated in some papers that Garibaldi had declared 
his support for the slave-oumersl Blind used this to extort a short 
letter from Garibaldi with  'CORDIAL  GREETINGS  FOR MRS  BLIND'.  YOU can 
see what lies he told Garibaldi from his remark 'I  THANK  YOU FOR  YOUR 
a 'M.  Karl  Blind',  North British Daily  Mail,  30 March  1863. - b  Marx refers  to the

GOOD NEWS'.2 What on earth could this 'GOOD NEWS' have been in 
October 1864? Blind was obviously writing Garibaldi the most 
monstrous lies about the progress of 'republicanism' in Germany, 
which is presumably just awaiting Blind's arrival to lash out. 
The most splendid aspect of the affair is that the London paper 
to which Blind is a regular contributor, the mouthpiece of the 
publicans (a most appropriate context to a 'Blind'), is a fanatical 
supporter of the Confederates!b And by the by, the paper— The 
Morning Advertiser—is at one and the same time the mouthpiece 
of spirits, the Low CHURCH (English pietism),55 the SWELL-MOB which is 
concerned with gambling, PRICEFIGHTS AND SO FORTH, and the most 
lickspittling poodle of Palmerston's. FROM A LITERARY STANDPOINT, it 
cannot be counted among the English daily press and is in general 
only read in TAPROOMS. 
So much for the man. 
In Lassalle's lifetime he issued an address casting doubt on the 
former's integrity.56  But Lassalle —as far as I know—did not think 
it worth the trouble of a reply. I was only surprised that 
B. Becker, who is fully aware of Blind's doings, did not then take 
the opportunity to blazon abroad my revelations about Blind? 
One of the reasons why I have joined the International Working 
Men's Association here is to expose that man. After the statements 
I have made against Blind, branding him as a 'deliberate liar' and a 
'falsifier of evidence', I cannot of course further involve myself in 
polemic against the fellow. I reserve the right to treat him as a 
figure of  comedy  should the occasion arise. If I should now take his 
scrawl against Lassalle, which I have incidentally not seen, as 
grounds for an attack on him, people here, who know of my 
implacable hostility to Blind, will think that in fact I am only using 
Lassalle's name as a pretext for personal spite. 
But do send me the (printed) declaration by the workers. I shall 
ensure that it gets into a German paper here and if student Blind 
then makes any further moves, perhaps he will give me the 
opportunity to let me fall upon him. 
At all events, you may depend on it that he will be shown no 
favours. In the meantime, the best thing you can do is to 
disseminate my revelations about Blind as a 'deliberate liar' and 
'falsifier' as far as possible in Germany. (If his scrawl about Lassalle 
had set any mice stirring here, a word or two about it at all events 
a Blind published Garibaldi's letter to him in The Morning Advertiser, 9 November 
1864.  - b i.e. the southern slave-owning states - c  Marx means his revelations about 
Blind in Herr Vogt.

would have reached my ears.) This would force him to break his 
silence and so enable me to open my mouth again concerning a 
fellow whom I have publicly declared to be atrocious. 
Apart from anything else, it would be quite impossible for me to 
travel to Berlin on account of the fresh outbreak of the fearful 
carbuncle disease that I have been struggling against for 14 
months with slight interruptions. 
You may, however, be sure that I shall seize whatever

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 57 
IN ST LOUIS 
Manchester, 24 November 1864 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
I was most pleased to hear from you again at long last.58  We 
have been without your address for years, otherwise you would 
already have received a reminder from me earlier on. My address 
is still Ermen & Engels and will probably continue to be so for five 
years or so yet, unless the storm breaks in Germany. Marx' 
address is No. 1, Modena Villas, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill, 
London, but Dr Marx, London, will also suffice if need be. 
Our plump little pig Blind is showing off here in Europe, 
wherever he can, just as he did over there, it is the only little 
pleasure the poor wee creature has, and he indulges it with an 
assiduity worthy of a better cause and greater success. However, 
ever since Marx belaboured him so thoroughly in Herr Vogt, he 
has been keeping out of our range.

38 15. Engels to Weydemeyer. 24 November 1864 
As far as Lassalle's flirtations with Bismarck are concerned, they 
are beyond dispute. The passages quoted by Blind3  were, of 
course, actually uttered by Lassalle in the speech he made in 
Düsseldorf in his defence and published by him, so there is 
nothing to be done there. 15 For all his distinctive qualities, Lassalle 
had that Jewish respect for momentary success, which made it 
impossible for him to deny Louis Bonaparte his respect, or to 
refrain from professing such overtly Bonapartist principles as he 
did. Those, who were more closely acquainted with him, knew that 
these things were not occasional happenings. You can readily 
imagine that this was as disagreeable to us as it was grist to the 
mill of piglet Blind, and that alone would have been sufficient 
ground for us to have had nothing to do with all Lassalle's 
agitation during his lifetime, although there were other reasons, 
too. Nevertheless, that is all over and done with now, and we shall 
have to see whether his agitation was just a flash in the pan, or 
whether there was really something to it. 
You will have heard that our poor Lupus died here on 9 May of 
this year. His was a loss for the party of an altogether different 
order from Lassalle's. We shall never again find such a steadfast 
fellow, who knew how to talk to the people and was always there 
when things were at their most difficult. For 4 long weeks he had 
the most terrible headaches, his German doctorb neglected him, 
and at length a vessel burst in his brain from the colossal pressure 
of the blood, he gradually lost consciousness and died 10 days 
later. 
Nothing of much interest is happening here in Europe. The 
suppression of the Polish uprising was the last decisive event; for 
his assistance in this, the Tsarc  gave Bismarck permission to take 
Schleswig-Holstein from the Danes. It will be a long time before 
Poland is capable of rising again, even with help from outside, and 
yet Poland is quite indispensable to us. The despicable behaviour 
of the liberal German philistines is to blame; if those curs in the 
Prussian Chamber had had more insight and courage, all might be 
well—Austria was ready to march in support of the Poles at 
any time, and it was only Prussia's attitude that prevented it, and 
the treachery of Mr Bonaparte, who was, of course, only prepared 
to keep his promises to the Poles if he could do so safely, i.e. if he 
was covered by Prussia and Austria.

stupendous things that one can experience. Despite the numerous 
blunders made by the Northern armies (enough by the South, 
too),  the tide of conquest is rolling slowly but surely onward, and, 
in the course of 1865, at all events the moment will undoubtedly 
come when the organised resistance of the South will fold up like a 
pocket-knife, and the warfare turn into banditry, as in the Carlist 
war in Spain 59 and more recently in Naples.12 A people's war of 
this kind, on both sides, has not taken place since great states have 
been in existence, and it will, at all events, point the direction for 
the future of the whole of America for hundreds of years to come. 
Once slavery, the greatest shackle on the political and social 
development of the United States, has been broken, the country is 
bound to receive an impetus from which it will acquire quite a 
differed position in world history within the shortest possible time, 
and a use will then soon be found for the army and navy with 
which the war is providing it. 
It was incidentally quite understandable that the North had 
some difficulty in providing itself with an army and generals. 
From the outset, the South's oligarchy had brought the country's 
few military forces under its control, it supplied the officers and 
furthermore raided the arsenals. The North found itself with no 
resources other than the militia, while the South had been training 
for years. From the outset, the South had a population accus­
tomed to the saddle for use as light cavalry, on a scale the North 
could not match. The North adopted the habit, introduced from 
the South, of filling positions with party supporters; the South, in 
the midst of a revolution and with a military dictatorship, could 
brush that aside. Hence, all the blunders. I do not deny that Lee is 
a better general than any the North has, and that his latest 
operations around the fortified camp at Richmond30 are master­
pieces from which our glorious Prince Frederick Charles of 
Prussia could learn much. But, ultimately, the determined attacks 
of Grant and Sherman made all strategy superfluous. It is clear 
that Grant is sacrificing a colossal number of men, but what else 
could he do? I have absolutely no idea of the level of discipline in 
your army, its cohesion under fire, its capacity and willingness to 
endure hardship, and in particular the nature of its  MORALE,  i.e. 
what can be demanded of it without its becoming demoralised. 
With such scanty reports and no proper maps, one needs to know 
all this before permitting oneself any judgment on this side of the 
water. What does seem certain to me, however, is that the army 
now commanded by Sherman is the best you have, as superior to 
Hood's as Lee's is to Grant's.

Your field-manual and elementary tactics are, as I hear, 
positively French—the basic formation thus presumably being the 
column with intervals between platoons. What kind of field 
artillery do you now have? If you can enlighten me on these 
points, I shall be greatly obliged. What has become of the great 
Anneke? Since the battle at Pittsburgh-Landing was all but lost60 
because he was not supplied with everything which he should have 
had, according to the Prussian field-manual, he has quite vanished 
from my view. Of the Germans who have joined in the war, 
Willich appears to have given the best account of  himself,  whereas 
Sigel has UNMISTAKEABLY demonstrated his mediocrity. And Schurz, 
the valiant Schurz, farting away amidst the shower of bullets and 
shells,  what foes is he demolishing now? 
Apropos. The Prussian cannons that smashed Düppel a and 
Sonderburg 61 from 6,500 paces were our old long bronze 
24-pounders, rifled and rebuilt as breech-loaders, 54-pound shells 
with 4-pound-charge! I've seen them with my own eyes.

I still need to hold on to the 'clipping' . a 
The position is now as follows: 
1. It was not until after I wrote to you that I saw that Blind has 
sent an answer to the Swabian Beobachter via Dr Bronner 
(unsigned, of course, but dated Bradford; letter, naturally, written 
by Blind  himself,  in which he firstly proves that by his influence 
over '7' million Germans he in fact shaped American politics; 
secondly, he has the impudence to say that the Vogt affair has 
been disposed of by statements from all sides. 62 So, I have grounds 
here for replying and referring to the 'AFFIDAVITS',63  and, at the 
same time, an extract from Weydemeyer's letter would kill two 
birds with one stone, firstly exposing Blind's influence on America 
and secondly giving the old countess some kind of satisfaction as 
far as Lassalle is concerned. 
2. These 'Republican  Protests',  which Blind has sent with the same 
date to St Louis, Frankfurt am Main and the London Hermann, 
are only identical in their general drift. In the shit in the Hermann 
and the Frankfurter Journal^" which I shall try to send you later 
today, this Baden publican" has simply put together the passages 
which were most damaging to ourselves, whilst across the ocean he 
is more insolent and resorts to bare-faced lies. 
But the real  'POINT'  is this, a 'POINT' typical of the way he 
manufactures his pamphlets: in the European edition he says that 
the protest comes from American and European republicans, whilst 
in the American edition he calls upon the American government to 
protest. Here we have caught the dog in flagranti.0 
3. Since Lassalle is dead and can do no more harm, we must of 
course—as far as possible, i.e. without compromising ourselves— 
defend him against these petty-bourgeois scoundrels. 
My plan is therefore this: to reply (briefly) in the Siuabian 
Beobachter; 1. putting the record straight about the 'statements from 
all sides' in the Vogt affair; 2. giving an extract from 
Weydemeyer's letter about Blind's influence in America; 3. 
exposing the fellow afresh by comparing the European and 
American editions of his 'Republican Protest'; finally 4. concluding 
that it is NOT WORTH WHILE defending Lassalle against such a comical 
character. 
If this seems all right to you, send me a wire and I will tie the 
whole business up tomorrow, amongst other things in order to 
have some peace with the 'old girl'. I said in my letter to her, by 
il from Die Westliche Post with Blind's article 'Ein republikanischer Protest' - b Neue

Dear Weiwi, 
The whole household and myself were extraordinarily pleased 
to hear from you and your family again. My wife asserts that she 
wrote to yours*' last and is thus expecting to have the first letter 
back from her.

I am, at the same time, sending you by mail 4 copies of a 
printed 'Address',3  of which I am the author. The newly established 
INTERNATIONAL Workers' Committee, in whose name it has been put 
out, is not without significance. Its English members consist chiefly 
of the heads of the TRADE-UNIONS here, in other words, the real 
worker-kings of London, the same people who organised that 
gigantic reception for Garibaldi and who, by that monster meeting 
in St James's Hall (under Bright's chairmanship), prevented 
Palmerston declaring war on the United States, which hè was on the 
point of doing. 19 On the French side, the members are unimpor­
tant figures, but they are the direct spokesmen of the leading 
'workers' in Paris. There is likewise a link with the Italian 
associations, which recently held their congress in Naples.22 
Although I have been systematically refusing to participate in any 
way whatsoever in all the 'organisations', etc. for years now, I 
accepted this time because it concerns a matter by means of which 
it is possible to have a significant influence. 
For the past 14 months I have been suffering almost constantly 
from carbuncles, which often threatened my life. More or less 
cured now. 
Engels will have written to you of the loss of our friend Lupus. b 
Curiously enough, I received a letter from Berlin last Friday, in 
which the old Hatzfeldt woman urged me to defend Lassalle 
against Blind's 'Republican Protest'. 42 The next day I received your 
letter to Engels, containing the much amended American edition of 
the same garbage. By a third coincidence, I was, at the same time, 
sent 2 numbers of the Swabian Beobachter (from Stuttgart) which I 
never see otherwise. In the first number the editor c was poking 
fun at a letter from Mr Blind to the American nation which had 
been translated from the English by 'Mr Blind' and sent to him 
and to other South German editors; in it, 'almost at official request', 
as he puts it, he gives his inexpert opinion on Lincoln's election, 
etc. d In the same number, the editor said that one can see from 
my book attacking Vogte  what Blind's vanity leads to, etc. 
Whereupon, Blind sent the enclosed reply through his man-of-straw, 
Dr Bronner of Bradford, 1. setting out just how powerful his 
influence in America was, and 2. having the impudence to say that 
the Vogt affair was 'a put-up-job'. 62 This then enabled me (using 
your letter and copying the passages relating to Blind) to put out the 
a 'Inaugural Address of the Working Men's International Association'. - b  Wilhelm

Dear Friend, 
Today you will receive from me by post 6 copies of the ADDRESS 
OF THE WORKINGMEN'S INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION'/ of which I am the 
author. Please be so good as to convey a copy with my kindest 
regards to Madame Markheim (Fulda). Give one to Mr Miquel as 
well. 
The Association—or rather its Committee—is important be­
cause the leaders of the London TRADE-UNIONS belong to it, the 
same people who organised that enormous reception for Garibaldi 
and thwarted Palmerston's plan for a war with the United States 
by means of the monster meeting in St James's Hall.19 The leaders 
of the Parisian workers are also in contact with it.

In the last few years I have been much afflicted with illness 
(e.g., in the last 14 months by a recurrence of carbuncles). My 
private circumstances have improved in consequence of a legacy 
from the death of my mother.3 
I think that my book on capital (60 sheets) will at last be ready 
for the press next year.66 
You will doubtless understand the reasons for not allowing 
myself to become involved in Lassalle's movement in his lifetime, 
without my spelling them out in detail. However, that cannot deter 
me—the more so since persons close to him are urging me to do 
so—from taking up his defence, now that he is dead, against such 
despicable curs as the clamorous K. Blind.b 
I am afraid that in mid-spring or early summer of next year 
there will be war between Italy, Austria and France. This will be 
very damaging for the movement in France and England, which is 
growing significantly. 
I hope to hear from you soon. 
Yours very respectfully

Dear Uncle, 
I hope that you are in the best of health despite the ABOMINABLE 
weather. All is well here. Except that, to the great alarm of the 
whole family, I had a most malignant carbuncle below the left 
breast at the beginning of this month, which kept me in great pain 
for 2-3 weeks. Other than that, everything has been going well.

The trade crisis, which I predicted to you long before its actual 
arrival,2 has by this time long since lost its edge, although its 
consequences in the manufacturing districts proper are still very 
considerable. On the other hand, I believe a political crisis is to be 
expected in the spring or early summer. Bonaparte has again 
reached the point where he will have to make war again if he is to 
raise a loan. The Venetian business is being kept open (I am 
acquainted with some of the agents there) so that it can provide a 
point of contact if need be.68 It is possible that Bonaparte will 
again find a way out, and then he will keep the peace (for he is no 
REAL Napoleon), but that is rather improbable. 
The enclosed printed 'Address"3 is written by  myself.  The 
matter hangs together like this: in September the Parisian workers 
sent a delegation to the London workers to demonstrate support 
for Poland. On that occasion, an international Workers' Commit­
tee was formed. The matter is not without importance because 1. 
in London the same people are at the head who organised the 
gigantic reception for Garibaldi and, by their monster meeting 
with Bright in St James's Hall, prevented war with the United States.19 
In a word, these are the real workers' leaders in London, with one 
or two exceptions all workers themselves. 2. On the Parisian side, 
Mr Tolain (ouvrierc  himself,  as well) et Co. are at the head, i.e., the 
same people who were prevented by a mere intrigue on the part 
of Garnier-Pages, Carnot, etc., from entering the Corps législatif 
at the last elections in Paris as representatives of the workers 
there, 4 and 3. on the Italian side, it has been joined by the 
representatives of the 4-500 Italian workers' clubs which held their 
general congress in Naples some weeks ago,22 an event which even 
The Times considered important enough to merit a few dozen 
lines in the paper.d 
Courtesy toward the French and the Italians, who always require 
florid language, has obliged me to include a few superfluous turns 
of phrase in the preamble to the 'Rules',6 though not in the 
'Address'.23 
A few days ago I received a letter from America from my friend 
Weydemeyer, Colonel in the regiment stationed at St Louis 
(Missouri). Amongst other things, he writes—and these are his 
exact words:

'We are regrettably being detained here at St Louis, since, in view of the many 
"conservative" elements here, a military force is a continuing necessity to prevent a 
break-out and the possible release of the numerous Southern prisoners.... The 
whole campaign in Virginia is a  BLUNDER,  which has cost us innumerable men. But 
for all that, the South will not be able to hold out much longer: it has sent its last 
man into battle and has no fresh army to call upon. The present invasion of 
Missouri, like the incursions into Tennessee, has only the character of a RAID, a 
foray: there can be no thought of a lasting re-occupation of districts that have been 
lost.'3 
When you reflect, my dear Uncle, how at the time of Lincoln's 
election 372 years ago it was only a matter of making no further 
concessions to the slave-owners, whereas now the avowed aim, 
which has in part already been realised, is the abolition of slavery, 
one has to admit that never has such a gigantic revolution 
occurred with such rapidity. It will have a highly beneficial 
influence on the whole world. 
At a public MEETING this week the fellow-member of our race 
Benjamin Disraeli has again made a dreadful laughing-stock of 
himself by assuming the mantle of guardian angel of the  HIGH 
CHURCH69 and CHURCH RATES, repudiating criticism in religious affairs.15 
He furnishes the best evidence of how a great talent unaccom­
panied by conviction creates rogues, albeit gold-braided and 'RIGHT 
HONORABLE' ones. 
Those jackasses in Germany have again made a proper 
laughing-stock of themselves over the Müller affair, 36 with 
ex-parson Kinkel at their head. 
With kindest regards from the whole family to you and from me 
to Jettchen, Dr, Fritz c et Co.

MARX TO ENGELS 29 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 2 December 1864 
DEAR  FRED, 
THANKS  FOR THE GUARDIAN* 
I did send on a few COPIES of the 'Address"3 to E. Jones 
afterwards, with a letter to him saying that he would probably 
receive one from you first. He writes today that he has neither 
seen nor heard anything from you. His address is 55, not 52, 
Cross Street. He says in his letter that, when the Assizes are over, 
he will form a branch association in Manchester amongst his 
acquaintances. 
Could you by any chance dig up the address of the musician 
Petzler (maybe from the Manchester directory, or the Schiller 
Association28)? He has a lot of contacts among the Manchester 
workers, and without  ANY  INTERVENTION  ON YOUR  PART  I could put him in 
touch with E. Jones from here. You would only need to send me 
Petzler's address. 
The worst thing about agitation of this kind is that one gets very 
BOTHERED  as soon as one becomes involved in it. E.g. Address to 
Lincoln now on the agenda again, and again I had to compose the 
thingc (which is far more difficult than writing a proper work)—so 
that the phraseology to which that kind of writing is limited, is at least 
distinguishable from vulgar-democratic phraseology.70 Fortunately, 
Mr Fox is doing the Polish business which is coming up in connection 
with 29 November, the anniversary of the Polish revolution of 
1830.71 
In the Committee, since the address for Lincoln is to be handed 
over to Adams, some of the English wanted to have the deputation 
introduced  BY A MEMBER  OF PARLIAMENT—as is  CUSTOMARY.  This desire was 
suppressed by the majority  OF the  ENGLISH  and the unanimity of the 
continentals, and it was declared instead that such  OLD  ENGLISH  CUSTOMS 
OUGHT  TO BE ABOLISHED.  On the other hand: M. Le Lubez, as a real 
crapaud, d wanted the address to be directed not to Lincoln but  TO THE 
a The Manchester Guardian - b K. Marx, 'Inaugural Address of the Working Men's 
International  Association'. - c K. Marx, 'To Abraham Lincoln, President of the 
United  States of America'. - d philistine

AMERICAN  PEOPLE.  I made him look suitably foolish and made it clear to 
the English that FRENCH DEMOCRATIC ETIQUETTE is not worth a FARTHING 
more than MONARCHICAL ETIQUETTE. 
Apropos. Naturally it is impossible to have a movement here 
without its own press-organ. The Bee-Hive (weekly, organ of the 
TRADES-UNIONS) was therefore declared to be the organ of the 
Association. By a stroke of ill-luck, to which the workers are 
particularly susceptible, a scoundrel called George Potter (in the 
BUILDING STRIKES72 he acted as MOUTHPIECE in The Times, but with 
articles written not by himself but by others) has installed himself as 
MANAGER with a clique of shareholders, who have so far formed the 
majority. The COMMITTEE, whose English members are mostly 
Bee-Hive shareholders (a share costs only 5s., and no one can have 
more than 5 votes, even if he holds  5,000  shares; thus 1 vote per 
share up to a maximum of 5), has therefore decided that we 
should set up a share-fund here which will enable us to create 
shareholders AND TO  SWAMP  THE OLD MAJORITY. I would appreciate it if 
you would let us have a contribution for this purpose as well. The 
whole operation must, of course, be confined to the close friends 
of the members of the Committee, as otherwise counter-measures 
would be promptly taken by the other side (i.e. before the GENERAL 
MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS which is not far off now). 
Besides the Hermann, there was also another little paper here, 
the Londoner Anzeiger, which belongs to the worthy Jewish 
bookseller Bender. It is trying to build itself up as a competitor to 
the Hermann, as the editorship has been taken over by a certain 
L. Otto von Breidtschwerdt, although he writes under the name of 
L. Otto. I shall hardly become directly involved in the thing at all, 
as I had my fill with the Volk, but it is good for reprinting 
statements in London as soon as they appear in the German 
newspapers, e.g. like the one against Blind. 2 
This Otto first got to know Eccarius, at whose suggestion he 
became a German member of the INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE. He is a 
Swabian, Stuttgarter born and bred. Quite a young fellow,  ABOUT  27 
OR as. Very much like my wife's elder brother. 6 Began as a cadet in 
the Austrian army, where he learnt all kinds of languages and was 
stationed all over the place. Subsequently studied in Tübingen. As 
a person, he is a very pleasant, witty fellow and well-mannered. 
His head is still stuffed full of petty Swabianisms and Germanic 
nonsense. For all that, very good knowledge and ability. But he

Westphalen

seems to me to have more inclination than a gift for writing; dull, 
doctrinaire. He is useful as a go-between with South Germany and 
especially the Land of the Swabians. Also writes in the Augsburger" 
from time to time, which is, incidentally, entirely what you would 
expect from the Vogt standpoint. 
I wrote to Mr Klings that it was difficult, but also quite 
unnecessary, to decide between Moses and Bernhard. b Both were 
honest and both incompetent. I said that, at the present moment, 
it was neither here nor there who has the title of President. When 
the time became decisive, there would be no difficulty in finding 
the right people.' 
I am very much afraid I can feel another carbuncle starting on 
my right hip. Allen knows nothing about it as I have been treating 
myself for some time. If I went to him now about the arsenic 
business, which after all you cannot start without a doctor and to 
which he might perhaps not even agree, he would give me the 
most dreadful dressing down for having been carbuncling for so 
long behind his back!!

In his reply to Mayer the Swabian (via his man-of-straw 
Bronner), d Blind states that Lincoln and Fremont were fighting for 
his vote because it would decide the ELECTION. 62 And in an American 
newspaper, The Radical Democrat? that he was responsible for the 
Polish revolution.

Blind's boasting—I have sent the scrawl to Weydemeyer—that he 
absolutely drew in his horns and paid compliments to the 'excellent

DEAR  FRED, 
MY COMPLIMENT  TO MRS  LIZZY.3 
You had  already given  me  your  PRIVATE ADDRESS  some time  ago,  but 
not the  'FIRM'  to which  to write.  I am  very glad  to have  it now,  as I 
sometimes find  it desirable  to drop  you a few  lines  ON SATURDAYS. 
The £5 for  Wilhelm b is already  on its way to  Berlin today. 
You have  not  sent  me  back  the  Becker.74 However cunningly 
'the Red'  fancies  he has  extricated himself from  the  matter,  his 
letter is a  DOCUMENT  WHICH  ONE  FINE MORNING  HE  MAY  FIND  TO TURN  UP for 
unforeseen purposes.  The old  Hatzfeldt woman will, incidentally, 
ensure that  the  statement' gets  to the  right person.64 
WHAT  ABOUT SHERMAN'S EXPEDITION?  5 
Apropos. Your  POOR-HOUSE  Purdy  is said  to have published  an 
absolutely disgraceful document during  the  COTTON-FAMINE,40  recom­
mending reducing support  to a  minimum,  on the  grounds that  the 
HEALTH  of THE  COTTON-OPERATIVES  was said to have improved; as a result 
of this,  FAMINE DISEASES  are said to have broken out in the  EAST  OF 
LANCASHIRE.  (That was in the early days of the  COTTON-FAMINE.)  DO you 
know anything about  it? And, in  general,  can you  obtain  for me 
the OFFICIAL  PAPERS  in Manchester (of the Committee,d etc.) relating to 
the COTTON-FAMINE? 
Lothario Bücher, whom Lassalle appointed executor  to his  will 
and to whom  he  left £150 a  year pension,  has, as you  probably 
already know, gone over  to Bismarck's camp. Baron Izzy c would 
perhaps have done  the  same himself  as  'Minister  of  Labour1 , 
Marquis Posa  to Philipp  II of the  Uckermark/  but not  IN THE SMALL 
WAY OF  Lothario, with whom  the  Hatzfeldt woman  has  fallen  out 
and who  can now  shake hands with Edgar Bauer  and the  Prussian 
consul  in Milan,  Mr R.  Schramm.  The  Prussians were looking  for 
a post  for Mr  Schramm 'where  yer  don't need  no  exam'. 8 I also

fancy Mr Rodbertus' intentions are 'none too 'onourable' because he 
is claiming to 'have entirely divorced the social question from polities',a a 
sure sign that he has got the ministerial itch. What a contempt­
ible gang, all that riff-raff from Berlin, Brandenburg and Pome-
rania! 
I fancy there is a  SECRET  UNDERSTANDING between Prussia, Russia and 
France for THE WAR AGAINST AUSTRIA IN NEXT SPRING. Venetia will, of 
course, provide the WAR-CRY.68  The Austrians are behaving with 
abysmal cowardice and stupidity. This ensues from Francis Joseph 
himself interfering personally in Austrian politics. Buol-
Schauenstein, etc., all the sensible hommes d-état, h are obliged to 
keep their traps shut, and the Russian agents, such notorious 
fellows as the present Austrian FOREIGN MINISTER, 0 are giving all the 
orders. For all that, the Austrians' behaviour would be inexplica­
ble, unless these fellows either have faith in Prussia's perfidious 
promises or are determined to accept the long-standing promise of 
compensation in Turkey. 
What do you say to Collet's profound discoveries—based on 
Urquhart—about Nebuchadnezzar and the Russians' Assyrian 
ancestry, and the further discovery, which is cited as 'Urquhart's', 
that IN ITALY THE POPE IS THE ONLY REAL THING ?d 
Today's The Miner and Workman's Advocate—the Moniteur^ of 
the mineworkers in England and Wales—is printing the whole of 
my 'Address'/ The London 'BRICKLAYERS' (over 3,000 men) have 
announced they are joining the International Association, and 
they are fellows who have never before joined a MOVEMENT. 
There was a  SUB-COMMITTEE2'  meeting last Tuesday,g  at which Mr 
Peter Fox (his real name is P. Fox André) presented his address 
on Poland " to us. (This kind of thing is always dealt with 
beforehand in the SUBCOMMITTEE before going to the GENERAL 
COMMITTEE.) The piece is not badly written and Fox has en­
deavoured to apply the concept of 'class', at least a semblance of it, 
although it is normally alien to him. His real forte is FOREIGN POLICY, 
and it is only as a propagandist of atheism that he has had 
dealings with the WORKING CLASSES  AS SUCH. 
But easy though it is to get the English workers to accept a 
rational approach, one has to be all the more careful the moment

men of letters, members  of the  bourgeoisie  or semi-literary people 
become involved  in the  movement.  Fox,  like his  friend Beesly 
(Professor  of  Political Economy  at the  University  of London,  he 
took the  chair  at the  founding  MEETING  in St  Martin's Halla)  and 
other  'DEMOCRATS',  have  a fanatical 'love'  of France, which,  as far as 
FOREIGN POLICY  is concerned, they extend  not  only  to Napoleon  I but 
even  to  Boustrapa,"1  as  opposed  to  what they call,  not  without 
justice,  the  English aristocratic tradition,  and as a  continuation  of 
what they call  the  English democratic tradition  of 1791/92.  WELL! 
Not content  in his  address (which, incidentally,  is not to  appear  as 
an address from  the  whole Association  but as an  address from  the 
English section concerning the  POLISH  QUESTION,  endorsed by the 
whole Committee) with telling  the  Poles, which  is true, that  the 
French people  has  been traditionally more sympathetic towards 
them than the English, Mr Fox  WINDS  UP HIS  ADDRESS  mainly by 
consoling  the  Poles with  the  passionate friendship that  THE ENGLISH 
WORKING  CLASSES  have conceived  FOR  THE  FRENCH  DEMOCRATS.  I opposed 
this and  unfolded  a historically irrefutable tableau  of the  constant 
French betrayal  of Poland from Louis  XV to  Bonaparte  III.  At the 
same time,  I pointed  out  how  thoroughly inappropriate  it was  that 
the ANGLO-FRENCH-ALLIANCE  should appear  as the  'core'  of the 
INTERNATIONAL  ASSOCIATION,  albeit in a democratic version. To cut 
matters short, Fox's address  was  accepted  by the  SUBCOMMITTEE  on 
condition that  he  altered  the  'TAIL'  in  accordance with  my 
suggestions. Jung,  the  Swiss  SECRETARY  (from French Switzerland), 
declared that, as a  MINORITY  on the  GENERAL COUNCIL,  he would move 
that the  address  be  rejected  as  ALTOGETHER  'bourgeois'.7' 
Our Major Wolff  has  been locked  up by the  Piedmontese  for the 
moment  in the  fortress  of Alexandria. 
Louis Blanc  has  written  to the  General Secretary Cremer that  he 
approves  the  'Address'  and  regrets  not  having been able  to attend 
the St Martin's Hall  MEETING,  etc.  ALTOGETHER,  the sole purpose of his 
letter is to get him co-opted an  HONORARY MEMBER.  Foreseeing that 
attempts  of this kind would  be  made,  I had,  however, fortunately 
got the  BYLAW  accepted that  no one  (except workers'  SOCIETIES)  could 
be invited  to  join  and  that nobody  at all  could  be an  honorary 
member.'*

It was at your request that I made this statement, although its 
composition did not come easily to me as I did not agree with 
Lassalle's political tactics. However, all my scruples were removed 
by Blind's shameless outburst against the deceased in the St Louis 
'Westliche Post'.* 4 I had not the slightest idea which papers you 
would send the statement to. The Nordstern was the furthest from 
my mind. Mr Bruhn has now seized upon this opportunity to 
make an 'indecent gesture' in my direction, by hinting to his 
readers in the commentaries that I had sought access to his 
emporium through the back door and had been granted it as an 
act of extreme graciousness only because a third party had 
intervened especially on my  behalf. 64 I have no doubt that his 
accomplice in America3 will make use of this. Is it Mr Bruhn's 
desire that I should be forced into exposing him publicly for the 
conceited nonentity that he is? 
If Bruhn, Bernhard Becker and tutti quanti set out to oppose 
me and my efforts in any manner whatsoever that I consider 
harmful to the workers' movement  itself,  a storm will break about 
these gentlemen's heads that will take their breath away. Reasons 
of long-standing personal friendship and party interest, which 
held me back vis-à-vis Lassalle, can no longer have the slightest 
force in respect of these dii minorum gentium}' This I am stating 
once and for all, so that I cannot later be charged with ambiguity 
or inconsiderateness. 
In no circumstances, do I wish the Eighteenth Brumaire to be 
published, and, if steps have already been taken to this end, they 
are to be checked forthwith. 79 
I scarcely dare express any good wishes for the New Year, 
knowing as I do that the old year has left you, my dear Countess, 
only with memories. 
Yours very respectfully

Dear Siebel, 
A Happy New Year! 
You will perhaps have seen that Engels and I have agreed to 
become contributors to the Berlin Social-Demokrat. 80 Neverthe­
less—this entre nous* —either that paper will have to dissociate 
itself from the apotheosis of Lassalle, or we shall dissociate 
ourselves from it. But the poor devils have a lot to contend with. 
You will have received the 'Addresses'11  sent to you and have no 
doubt guessed I am the author. For the sake of the movement 
here, it is important for us that German workers' associations 
should join the Central Committee here. (As has happened in 
many cases with the Italians and the French.) Now Liebknecht has 
written to me that the Berlin printers' association will be joining, 
but that it is very doubtful whether the 'General Association of 
German Workers' 2 will join, on account of the intrigues of 
Mr Bernhard Becker, whose importance was 'invented' by Lassalle. 
(Entre nous this is perhaps Lassalle's only invention.) 81 
Today I wrote the old Hatzfeldt woman a kind of threatening 
letter, sub rosa,c of course. 
Now it would be highly desirable for you to pay a brief visit to 
Solingen to explain on my behalf to the cutler, Klings, how 
exceedingly important it is that the Association of German 
Workers should decide to join the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION at its 
congress in Düsseldorf on 27 December of this year. 82 You might 
surreptitiously hint that, for such nonentities as B. Becker, etc., 
what matters is, naturally, not the cause but the 'infiniment petit'? 
i.e., their own persons. But such a hint must be dropped 
diplomatically, without implicating me. 
You understand that it is necessary that the General Association 
of German Workers should join only for a start, on account of our 
a between ourselves - b K. Marx, 'Inaugural Address of the Working Men's 
International Association'. - c allusively (see previous letter) - d infinitely small

opponents here. At a later date, the whole organisation of this 
association will have to be broken up, as its basis is fundamentally 
wrong. 
If you do not now at last write me a few lines, I shall presume 
that you have become totally disloyal to me, and will proclaim you 
excommunicated.

MARX TO HERMANN JUNG 83 
IN LONDON 
Manchester,84  [about 8 January 1865] 
58 Dover Street, Oxford Street 
My dear Jung, 
I felt rather shocked at reading in the 'Beehive' and the 'Miner' 
of this week that at our last Committee-sitting 
'It was unanimously agreed to invite Messrs Beesly, Grossmith, Beales and 
Harrison, to the soirée which is to be held on the 16th'. a 
I do not mention the mere anachronism, that no such resolution 
was taken on last Tuesday's sitting.13 
What I object to is the positive falsehood that Mr Grossmith was 
invited. 
This Grossmith, although he seldom or never attends our sittings, 
figures as a member of the Committee under all our addresses. 
How could our Committee invite a member of our Committee to a 
soirée given by our Committee? Shall this, perhaps, form a sort of 
premium to be gained by regular absence from our weekly 
séances? 
Since I cannot return to London before the end of next week, 
you'll much oblige me 
By asking at next Tuesday's sitting, who is the writer of the 
report in the 'Beehive' and the 'Miner? 
Who empowered that writer to make our Committee the 
'unconscious' instrument of exalting Mr Grossmith? 
You will understand at once how important it is to nip in the 
bud any attempt at turning our Committee into the tool of local 
ambitions, or any sort of intrigues.

ENGELS TO RUDOLF ENGELS 10 
IN BARMEN 
[Manchester,] 10 January 1865 
Dear  Rudolf, 
My view of the American war" is this: the South is gradually 
becoming exhausted and cannot replace its armies. The North has 
not yet mobilised the half of its resources. The South is limited to 
defence, so much so in fact that counter-attacks such as, e.g., 
Longstreet undertook in the Shenandoah Valley, are now a thing 
of the past. Hood attempted yet another one, but, in so doing, 
revealed his own impotence and decided the whole campaign at 
one stroke.86 The North is superior to its Southern opponents at 
all points and, furthermore, has Sherman's 40,000 men at its 
disposal who can go wheresoever they please, everywhere destroy­
ing the South's forces, communications, resources and supplies 
deep in the South's own territory.75 Charleston is certain to fall in 
4-6 weeks at the latest, once Sherman has encircled it on land.87 
The South has but one army left, that at Richmond.30 That will 
assuredly be quite decisively beaten in the present year, and with 
that the defence of the South by armies will be at an end. A 
guerrilla war, brigandry, etc., may then ensue and will probably do 
so into next year. 
If the South arms its Negroes, that will be so much the better 
for the North. However, they will take good care not to. At the 
last moment, if at all. The Negroes are not so stupid as to allow 
themselves to be massacred for the whip that flays their backs.

62 30. Marx to His Daughter Jenny. 11 January 1865 
There will certainly still be moments when things look better for 
the South than they do now, but we have seen that happen too 
often before, and I shall not be deceived by that. Such moments 
are merely a respite. 
I do not believe we shall get cotton from America; but I do 
believe we shall see a temporary fall. Cotton is at present so 
subject to speculation that prices are affected by every vicissitude 
of public opinion. There are, moreover, 500,000 bales in 
Liverpool, and the people here do have a tendency to fly to 
extremes immediately and shout: the South is done for, is bound 
to surrender in 14 days, etc.—a rise is thereby inconceivable. We 
shall be at the mercy of whatever news we receive, though always 
with the proviso that we know the STOCK in Liverpool to be double 
what it was last year. I also believe we shall see the year 1865 close 
below present prices, as we must expect more cotton from all 
parts.

My sweet child, 
I wanted to leave Manchester tomorrow, but I'll be hardly able 
to do so before Sunday (15th Jan.) next.S4  Ernest Jones, whom I 
am anxious to speak, is busily engaged in the neighbouring towns 
and has invited me (and Engels) for next Friday evening when 
he'll be at home. I have not yet seen him, and could not see him 
before that day. This is one cause of delay. There are others, 
but at all events I shall not stay longer than until Sunday.

The German translation of the 'Address to the Working 
Classes'a  has been reprinted in the Mainzer Zeitung, the 'Address to 
Lincoln' b in the Berliner Reform and the London Hermann. The 
latter honour is probably due to Mr Juch's anxiety lest his rival 
Bender might monopolize 'our protection'. 
The weather here was abominable. Today 'the sun shines', as 
Müller has it, but its rays are reflected by the ice drops covering 
the dirty streets. Even the sunbeams must here always have 
something disagreeable to fall upon. 
I have not yet seen a Borchardt, and as to the Gumperts, I had 
only a few minutes' conversation with the Dr yesterday evening. 
On my arrival I did not find Frederick, but in his stead a letter 
informing me that he would be back from fox-hunting at 6 
o'clock. Meanwhile he had taken all precautionary measures for 
making my 'entrée joyeuse" 1 (with your great historical knowledge 
you'll not be at a loss as to the ' entrée  joyeuse') . Whether his change 
of domicile is an improvement, seems a rather debatable question. 
At all events, the people are less impudent. 
Apropos. There is much 'chronique scandaleuse' just now in the 
Freiligrath world, as far as it is connected with the General Bank of 
Switzerland. There has appeared a pamphlet at Genève, disclosing 
the scandalous mismanagement of Fazy, d Freiligrath's 'natural 
superior'. He has been forced to resign his post as supreme 
director of the bank, and 'um zu retten, was zu retten ist'* (literally 
this) Jew Reinach has been put into his place, assisted by a 
Frenchman and— Karl Vogt who has the despicable meanness of 
betraying, and denouncing, and publicly declaring against Fazy, his 
old idol, the man in fact of whom he is a mere 'creature'. 
I suppose you are aware that the first 'abonnement number'* of 
the 'Social-Democrat' has been confiscated by the police at Berlin. 88 
This is a rather favourable accident. Those fellows stand in need 
of some small political martyrdom. 
I hope all is right at home. The cat being gone, the mice ought 
to dance. Pay my compliments to Ma, 'Success', 'Mine Own' and 
the 'Prophet'.g As to  yourself,  my dear Aaron, I dreamt of you last

Sir, 
Despite its brief existence, your Social-Demokrat has already 
carried two attacks on the 'International Association'. I am only 
awaiting the  'third'  before my friends and I publicly dissociate 
ourselves from any connection with your paper. In the event of 
such a dissociation, I should be compelled to deal 'critically' with 
certain things which, in deference to party interests, I have 
hitherto not aired, and this may not be at all to the liking of 
certain gentlemen. The first attack on the 'International Associa-

tion' was contained in an inane passage in B. Becker's 'Message'. 90 
I did not hold you responsible for it for the very reason that it was 
a 'message' and you unfortunately have an official connection with 
the 'General Workers' Association'2 (emphatically not to be 
confused with the working class). 
The bare-faced, lying gossip of Mr Moses Hessa is another 
matter; if you had had the slightest consideration for me and my 
friends you would under no circumstances have accepted it, you 
could only have accepted it with the intention of provoking me. 
With regard to Moses' fabrication  itself,  I shall be making a 
public statement about it after I have obtained certain information 
from Paris.91 Regarding your acceptance of that abomination of an 
article, I should be obliged if you would inform me whether I am to 
consider same as a declaration of war by the 'Social-Demokrat'?

DEAR FREDERICK, 
Letters enclosed 
1. from Weydemeyer, 
2. from Schily, 
3. from Liebknecht. I must have all 3 back. 
4. from Schweitzer and 5. a scrawl about Vogt, which I would

By way of explanation for letters 2, 3 and 4, the following: I do 
not know whether you get the Social-Demokrat (or have taken out a

subscription  to it). (If  neither should  be the  case, Bender  can 
always send  you one  from here,  as he has  ordered  6 copies  on the 
off-chance.) 
There  was a  contribution  in the  Social-Demokrat from that 
jackass Moses Hess,"  in which  he  related  how we had  approached 
L'Association (paper  of the  Paris associations) asking them  to print 
a translation  of our  address 15 (on the  contrary, Massol  had  made 
Schily  an  offer to that effect)  and  join  our  Association; they  are 
said to  have refused, however, because  we had  originally 
approached Tolain  and  others  who  were Plon-Plonists. 93 Tolain 
himself  had  admitted  as much,  etc. 
I discovered this scrawl  on the day  after  my  return from 
Manchester.84 Therefore wrote furious letters  to  Paris94  and 
Berlin.0  From Schily 's  and  Schweitzer's letters  it emerges that  the 
whole thing  can be  blamed  on Hess' asininity (mixed with  a certain 
amount  of  MALICE,  perhaps)  and on  Liebknecht's asininity toute 
pure. d 
The affair created  a great furore  in the  Comité here yesterday. 
Le Lubez, entirely  on  Tolain's side, declares  the  whole thing  to be 
slanderous, since fellows like Horn (Einhorn, rabbi)  and  that 
gas-bag Jules Simon  (of La Liberté*)  are on the  Comité  of 
L'Association. However,  at my  suggestion,  it was  resolved  not to 
send  the 500  CARDS OF MEMBERSHIP  to Paris until Schily  had  reported 
further from Paris. 93 
The Association  is doing famously here.  At its  soirée/ which  I did 
not attend,  ABOUT  1,200  people (they would have  had 3x as  many  if 
the hall  had  been  big  enough) gathered, which brought approxi­
mately  £15  into  our  exceedingly depleted  EXCHEQUER.

There will  be a  MEETING  for the  Poles  in the  course  of February 
(especially  to  collect money  for the new  émigrés, which also 
explains Lord Townshend  as  CHAIRMAN),  organised  by the  (English) 
POLISH LEAGUE,  the Polish society here and our Association. 97 
What  do you say to  Lassalle's 'bequest',  as  described  by 
Liebknecht? 98 Is it not  exactly like  his own  Sickingen,  who  wants 
to compel Charles  V to  'assume  the  leadership  of the  movement'? 8

to his  urgent request  (and  also  to make  up to him for  having bitten 
his head  off  instead  of  Liebknecht's  for the  BLUNDER  in the

were intended  to do so.

Liebknecht  has also sent  me a  note from  the  editors, urgently

they  say  their paper  is read  by more people  of standing than  any

Now,  as far as the  YANKEE WAR  is concerned,  you  explained  to me 
before that  it was not  suitable  for the  Social-Demokrat. 
Regarding  the  Prussian Army Reform,  the  paper would  be a  very 
good place  for it.  Only  QUESTION  for me is  this: would  not an 
analysis  of this topic involve  you in a  one-sided conflict with  the 
men of Progress," which would  be  undesirable  at this moment

Dear Moor, 
I will send the letters back to you tomorrow or on Sunday, as I 
simply have to read this dreadful handwriting and these pale inks 
by daylight; yesterday evening I was only able to skim through 
them. 
Moses" really has been extraordinarily tactless (no doubt the

Liebknecht even more so. But I am surprised the latter has not

I am sending the fellows the little Danish folksong about 
Tidmann, who is struck dead by the old man at the Thing for 
imposing new taxes on the peasants.* It is revolutionary but not 
indictable, and above all it is directed against the feudal nobility, 
which the paperd absolutely must condemn. I am making a few 
remarks to that effect. I shall probably be able to do the article on 
the reorganisation of the armye as soon as I get the new military 
budget proposals, etc.; I am writing to ask them to send them to

against the men of Progress," and that the article must not be 
published if the first point is unacceptable to them. 102 As far as the 
American war is concerned, perhaps something can be made of it 
at a later date after all. The present phase is not yet complete, the 
calm, to use J. Grimm's term, is 'inorganic'. 
Good old Lassalle is after all gradually being unmasked as a 
common or garden scoundrel. It has never been our practice to 
judge people by what they thought but rather by what they were, 
and I do not see why we should make an exception in the late 
Izzy's case. Subjectively, his vanity may have made the affair seem 
plausible to him, but objectively it was the act of a scoundrel, the 
betrayal of the whole workers' movement to the Prussians. 
Throughout, the stupid fop does not seem to have obtained from 
Bismarck anything at all in return, nothing specific at all, let alone 
guarantees 98; he seems just to have taken it for granted he would 
definitely do Bismarck in the eye, in exacdy the same way as he could 
not fail to shoot Racowija dead. That's Baron Izzy all over 
for you. 
Incidentally, it will not be very long now before it becomes not 
merely desirable but necessary to make this whole affair public. We 
can only gain from it, and, if the business with the Association" 
and the paper in Germany bears fruit, the fellow's heirs will have 
to be thrown out soon enough now. Meanwhile, the proletariat in 
Germany will soon see what it has got in Bismarck. 
Kind regards to the  LADIES.

MARX TO ENGELS 103 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 30 January 1865 
Dear Engels, 
Tout d'accord. 11 As far as your anxiety about confiscation is 
concerned, what you must do is to announce quite briefly, as a 
foreword to the first article, b that you are firstly going to throw 
light on the subject from the military point of view, secondly you 
are going to criticise the bourgeoisie and, thirdly, the reaction, 
etc., and the attitude of the workers' party to the question, etc., 
whereby the drift can already be narrowly outlined or hinted at. 
This will, de prime  abord*"  make it more difficult for the 
government to confiscate. If it does so in spite of that, the 
Social-Demokrat will thereby be hurled into a new phase (for the 
fellows cannot at present confiscate without releasing the confis­
cated material, or taking it to court), and, at the same time, you 
must keep a copy of the manuscript of No. III. It is then the 
easiest thing in the world to publish it in the one of the 2 German 
papers here d and then send COPIES of it to Hamburg, etc., where 
one or other of the bourgeois papers is sure to print it. 
It seems to me that Schily has allowed himself to be duped by 
M. Hess. This is quite evident from all Moses' epistles to the 
Social-Demokrat.  (CF. K.I. No. 15 of the Social-Demokrat c which has 
just arrived and is, on the whole, full of the most revolting 
'Lassalleanism'. The gentlemen from Iserlohn speak of 'Lassalle-
Lincoln'.') Moses is our adversary, has forgotten neither our 
'expulsion from Brussels' nor our 'ejection from Cologne' 104 and 
always counts it to Lassalle's credit that he had the 'tact' so 
necessary for a 'leader of the people' to take M. Hess seriously. 
By the way, being the 'organ of the General Association of 
German Workers', the Social-Demokrat finds it extremely difficult 
to extricate itself from the apotheosis-soup.

Question and the German Workers' Party, Chapter 1. -  < from the outset - d The

Incidentally, since  we now  know that Izzy planned  to trade  off 
the workers' party  to  Bismarck98  (we  were previously quite 
unaware  of how)  so that he might become known  as the  'Richelieu 
of the  Proletariat',  I shall  not  now have any scruples about making 
it sufficiently plain  in the  preface  to my  book that  he is a  parrot 
and plagiarist.105 
I wonder whether  the  'poems':  'To  follow Lassalle  is our  every 
wish' a and  other nonsense which  the  workers  are  sending  to the 
Social-Demokrat,  do not  emanate directly  or indirectly from the old 
lady.b  At all  events,  I have already told the editors several times  in 
writing that this nonsense  has got to  stop  BY and  BY.106 
What sort  of fellows  the men of  Progress"  are is  evident  yet 
again from their conduct regarding  the  combination question.107 
(En passant,  the  Prussian Anti-Combination Law, like  all continen­
tal laws  of this kind,  has its  origin  in the  decree  of the  Assemblée 
Constituante  of 14  June  1791, 10S by which  the  French bourgeois 
imposed  the  most severe penalties  on  ANYTHING OF THE SORT,  in fact 
workers' associations  of any  kind,—e.g. loss  of civil rights  for a 
year—on  the  pretext that this constituted  restoration  of the guilds 
and is in  contravention  of liberté  constitutionelle c and the  'droits  de 
l'homme'. 6 It is so  characteristic  of Robespierre that,  at a  time when 
it was  a crime punishable  by the  guillotine  to be  'constitutional',  as 
defined  by the  Assemblée  of 1789,  all of its  laws directed against 
the workers remained  in force.) 
Here  in London  Mr  Bright  has  again spoiled  his  whole rapport 
with the  workers  by his  SPEECH  opposing  the  application  of the 
Ten Hours' Bill109 to the  BIRMINGHAM TRADES.e  A bourgeois of that 
kind really  is INCORRIGIBLE.  And the  fellow does that  at a mo­
ment when  he  wants  to make  use of the  workers  to beat  the 
oligarchs! 
Apropos.  As I  have now told  the  Social-Demokrat  twice that they 
must purge their paper  of this infantile 'apotheosis'  as far and as 
quickly  as possible,  it will doubtless  do no  harm  if you  make 
similar remarks  to the  editors when  you  send your article/  If we 
allow them  to use our  names, then  we can, at the  same time, 
demand that now, when people  are  aware  of Lassalle's  intended 
treachery,  they should  not  help  to throw dust  in the  eyes  of the

MARX  TO ENGELS 101 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  1 February  1865 
Dear  FREDERICK, 
Enclosed letter from Strohn  to be  returned; write  to me and let 
me know your thoughts about  the  publishing business  at the  same 
time. 110 
This 'Siebold'  is the  Siebold  of champagne fame,  NO DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT.  I really  am  rather afraid that  he did not  merely find  my 
reception of his bubbly enthusiasm very dry, but  THAT HE CAUGHT SOME 
QUEER  WORDS  AT GuMPERT'S DOOR,  AS I TOLD YOU  AT THE TIME.  At all  events,  it 
is nice  of the  fellow  and  quite typical  of wine-salesman politics  to 
go straight from  us to  Karl Blind  and run as his  MESSENGER  to 
Hamburg.  Has  Blind perhaps also placed  an  order  for  'sparkling 
wines'  and  granted  his  most gracious protection  to  scum-
scoundrelism  as  well?  I hope  for the  sake  of  bubbly's good 
reputation that Siebold  is no  such  VENAL  scum, although there  was 
no mistaking that while  one of his  eyes  was  sparkling with 
enthusiasm,  the  other  HAD AN EYE TO BUSINESS.  Regarding Freiligrath,  I 
FEEL SURE  that he is much  TOO CAUTIOUS  to agree publicly in any way to 
collaborate  (in  partibus?  it  goes without saying) with Blind. 
HOWEVER,  I SHALL TRY  TO ASCERTAIN THE FACT.  At all events, it is very good 
that Strohn  has so  gratifyingly baulked Ruge  and  Blind.  I sent  off 
a to all  appearances  (In  partibus infidelium—literally:  in  parts inhabited  by 
unbelievers.  The  words  are  added  to the  title of Roman Catholic bishops appointed 
to purely nominal dioceses  in non-Christian countries).

a few  sarcastic marginalia  to him  earlier today,111  intended 
specifically  for  Meissner, concerning  the  nobile par 3 of antagonistic 
brothers. 
You must excuse  the  scraps  of English  in my  epistle  as there  was 
a SITTING  OF  THE  COUNCIL  yesterday which lasted until  ONE  O'CLOCK. 
( 'Liquor'  and  'smoke'  are  banned from these  'SITTINGS'.)  The  first 
thing  was  the  answering epistle from Lincoln, which  you  may  find 
in tomorrow's Times112  and  certainly  in The  Daily News  and The 
Star.b In the reply to the  LONDON  EMANCIPATION SOCIETY113  (which 
counts among  its  members such illustrious figures  as Sir  Charles 
Lyell  and the  'Voice  of World History', alias  K. B. c), published  in 
yesterday's Evening Star,  the old man  drily dismisses  the  fellows 
with two  formal clichés, exactly  as he had  done  in his  earlier 
answer to the Manchester branch of the  EMANCIPATION SOCIETY; 
whereas  his  letter  to us is in  fact everything  we  could have asked 
for, and, in  particular,  the  naive assurance that  the  United States 
could  not  involve itself directly  in  'PROPAGANDISM'.  At any  rate,  it is 
the only answer  so far  ON THE PART OF THE OLD MAN  that  is more than  a 
strictly formal  one. 
Secondly,  a delegate  was  there from  the  Poles (aristocrats),  who 
have links with  the  'LITERARY SOCIETY',114  through whom these 
gentlemen conveyed their solemn assurance, with  an eye to the 
forthcoming  MEETING  on  Poland, that they  are  democrats  and  that 
every Pole  is now a  democrat, since  the  aristocracy  has  dwindled 
away  to such  a degree that they would  be mad not to  recognise  the 
impossibility  of  restoring Poland without  a peasant rising.  WHETHER 
or not  these fellows believe what they  say, at all  events,  the  last 
lesson they  had  does  not  seem  to have been entirely wasted  on 
them.24 
Thirdly, there were statements from various  TRADES UNIONS  about 
their joining. Ditto from  an  association  in  Brussels which  is 
promising  to organise branches throughout Belgium.116 
I then handed over  an  issue  of the  Daily  St.  Louis Press which 
had arrived just yesterday containing leader about  our  'ADDRESS TO 
THE WORKINGMEN"1  and an  excerpt from  it which  had  obviously been 
arranged  by  Weydemeyer.e 
But now the  most remarkable thing  of all. 
Cremer, OUR  HONORARY GENERAL SECRETARY,  had received a written 
invitation  for the  'COUNCIL',  as  well  as a  private visit, from  a 
PROVISIONAL  COMMITTEE  which is meeting privatim at the London 
a noble pair (Horace, Satires,  II, III, 243) - b The  Morning Star  - c Karl Blind  -
d K.  Marx, 'Inaugural Address  of the  Working Men's International Association'.  -

Tavern next Monday. Object:  MONSTER MEETING  for  MANHOOD SUFFRAGE. 
Chairman:—Richard Cobden! 
The point  is this:  as E.  Jones told  us  previously, these fellows 
have been  a complete failure  in Manchester. They have therefore 
adopted  A BROADER PLATFORM,  in which  REGISTRATION FOR PAYING POOR-RATE' 
figured instead  of  MANHOOD SUFFRAGE,  however. That  is what  is stated 
in the  printed circular sent  to us.  However, since various 
indications made  it clear  to them that nothing less than  MANHOOD 
SUFFRAGE  can attract  ANY CO-OPERATION WHATEVER ON THE PART OF THE WORKING 
CLASSES,  they have announced they  are  prepared  to  accept  the 
latter.  A big  demonstration  in London would lead  to similar ones 
in the  provinces, write  the  provincials  'yet  once again', having  'all 
ready' realised that they  are not  able  TO SET THE BALL A-GOING. 
The next question raised yesterday  was  this: should  our  SOCIETY, 
I.E. COUNCIL,  agree  to what these fellows want (they include  all the 
old SHAM  CITY  AGITATORS  such as Sam. Morley, etc.) and send a few 
delegates  to attend  the  transactions  of their provisional committee 
as 'watchmen'? Secondly,  if these fellows pledge themselves directly 
to the slogan of  MANHOOD SUFFRAGE  and the  PUBLIC MEETING  is being 
called under this slogan, should  we  promise  our  support?  The 
latter  is, you see,  just as crucial  to these fellows  as it was in the 
American business.113 Without the  TRADES  UNIONS,  no mass  MEETING  is 
possible, and without us, the  TRADES  UNIONS  are not to be had. This is 
also the  reason  why  these gentlemen have come  to us. 
Opinions were very divided,  for  which Bright's latest silly tricks 
in Birmingham were much  to blame.3 
On my  motion,  it was  decided that:  1) the  delegation should  be 
sent (in my  motion,  I excluded  FOREIGNERS  from  it; but  Eccarius  and 
Lubez were elected  on to it as  'Englishmen'  and  silent witnesses) 
just as 'observers'116; 2) so  FAR AS THE  MEETING  is CONCERNED,  we should 
act with them firstly  if  MANHOOD SUFFRAGE  is proclaimed directly  and 
publicly  in the  programme,  and  secondly  if people selected  by us are 
included  on the  permanent committee,  so that they  can  keep  an eye 
on those fellows  and  compromise them  in the  event  of  fresh 
treachery, which,  as I  made plain  to all of  them,  is at any  rate 
intended.  I am  writing  to E.  Jones about  the  matter today.117

MARX TO ENGELS" 8 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 February 1865 
DEAR FREDERICK, 
Enclosed 
1. Letter from Siebel 119 reporting on his meeting with Klings, 
with which I had 'charged' him. a My only comment on it is that I 
am not going to interfere in the affair any further. If Klings 
succeeds—without our help—in getting rid of B. Becker and his 
testamentary importance, together with the beastly old girl,b that 
suits me. There is nothing to be done with the Workers' 
Association2 as bequeathed by Baron Izzy.c The sooner it is 
disbanded, the better. 
2. Rheinische Zeitung with leading article, 120 probably by Red 
Becker.d It amounts to an APPEAL ad misericordiame from the 'men 
of Progress'.99 
My opinion is now that the two of us must issue a statement, and 
that this crisis particularly gives us the opportunity to reoccupy 
our 'LEGITIMATE' position. ABOUT 10 days ago, I wrote to Schweitzer 
that he must stand up to Bismarck and the workers' party must 
drop even the appearance of flirting with Bismarck, etc.121 By way 
of thanks, he has 'all ready' been philandering with Pissmarck 
more than ever. 
'Yet again' Moses Hess is 'all ready' denouncing the 'International 
Association'122 for the second time in No. 16 of the Social-
Demokrat, which contains the letter I wrote about Proudhon,1 
bristling with misprints. I wrote a furious letter to Liebknecht 
about it yesterday, 1" telling him that this was the very last 
warning; that I do not give a FARTHING for 'good will' when its 
actions are those of ill-will; that I cannot make it clear to the 
members of the 'INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE' here that things like that 
occur in bonne fois  out of pure stupidity; that while their gutter 
rag continues to eulogise Lassalle, even though they know what 
treachery he had up his sleeve, 98 and while it conducts this

cowardly flirtation with Bismarck, it has the effrontery to let the 
Plonplonist93 Hess accuse us here of Plonplonism, etc. 
My opinion is now that we should take up Moses' denunciation 
or insinuation in order  d'abord*  to issue a brief declaration of war 
against Bonaparte Plon-Plon, at the same time making honourable 
mention of Moses' friend, the Rabbi Ein-Horn. Then we should 
use this to declare ourselves ditto against Bismarck, as well as 
against the rogues or fools who are dreaming or drivelling about an 
alliance with him for the sake of the working class. Then, of course, 
in conclusion the beastly men of Progress should be told that they 
have,  on the one hand, run their cause into the ground by their 
political cowardice and helplessness, and that, on the other hand, 
if they are demanding an alliance with the working class against 
the government—which at the moment is, of course, the only 
correct line—then they would at least have to make the 
concessions to the workers that accord with their own principle of 
'FREETRADE' and 'DEMOCRATISM', in other words, repeal of all the 
exceptional laws against the workers, which in addition to the 
combination laws quite specifically include the present Prussian 
legislation on the press. They would ditto have to proclaim, at 
least in principle, the restoration of universal suffrage, which was 
abolished by the coup d'état in Prussia. 123 This would be the 
minimum to be expected of them. Maybe something ought to be 
put in about the military question as well. At all events, the thing 
needs to be tied up quickly. And you must get your 'ideas' about 
the whole statement down on paper. I will then add mine to it and 
knead it all together, will send the whole thing back to you once 
again  AND  so FORTH. The moment seems to me to be favourable for 
this 'coup d'état'. We cannot miss this moment for our 'restitutio in 
integrum'" out of consideration for Liebknecht or for anyone else. 
AT THE  SAME  TIME,  you must not fail to let the Social-Demokrat have 
your article on the military questionc so SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
I would of course write to them—quoadA statement—that, if 
they do not accept same immediately, same will 'all ready' appear 
in other papers. 
If they do accept it, well and good, and it will not even matter if 
it blows them sky high. (Although Bismarck will take care not to 
resort to forcible measures at the present moment.) If they do not 
accept it, we have a decent excuse for getting rid of them.e At all

Dear Moor, 
I fully agree about the statement.3 But you will have to do it 
yourself,  or I shall never get the military article15 done. I fear the 
thing is getting to be so long that it will only be feasible in 
pamphlet form. I and II are finished (except for revision), III not 
yet. I have had a lot of interruptions, Blank was here, etc., etc. So, 
you do the statement. The exceptional law also includes the 
restriction on the right of association and assembly, all the 
legislation concerning journeymen's road  books 1'24 and finally Article 
100 of the penal code: Incitement of citizens to hatred and 
contempt (another Napoleonic legacy). Then, if you can work it in, 
some indication that in a predominantly agricultural country like 
Prussia it is despicable to attack only the bourgeoisie in the name 
of the industrial proletariat, without even mentioning the brutal 
patriarchal exploitation of the rural proletariat by the big feudal 
aristocracy. It is less important to say anything about the military 
question, but the budget question should be given prominence: what 
use is it to the workers to have a parliament elected by universal 
suffrage, if it is as powerless as Bismarck wants to make the

be? And if it cannot even reject new taxation? 
Those are my thoughts ad hoc? So, get going and sent the thing 
to me straightaway. 
Meissner. So  FAR SO GOOD.  You should go there  yourself,  of course. 
Conto a meta h has its advantages if you reserve the contractual 
right to inspect the books and documents and if Meissner is 
prepared to make you an interest-free advance equal to 2/3 of the 
fee you are claiming anyway. Strohn's letter seems to suggest that 
Meissner  WOULD RATHER NOT FART WITH ANY MONEY  IF HE COULD HELP IT. 66 At all 
events, you must go there yourself with the manuscript' and settle 
it. 
Moreover, get on with it quickly now. The time is really ripe for 
the book, and our names again command respect in the public 
eye. You know how fashionable it is to procrastinate in publishing 
in Germany. So, do not miss the moment—it may make an 
enormous difference to the impact it produces. 
Siebold.  I have told you before that lads like that are not to be 
trusted and I was sure from the beginning that he would call on 
Blind in London. The assumption that he had picked up some 
odd remarks ad portant Gumperti d is quite unnecessary. The fellow 
has always done that and will always do so. But it is a good thing 
we have our eye on him 'all ready'. 
I gather from Siebel's letter,"9  which I am keeping here, that 
the Lassalle Association z will very soon be ruined, thanks to its 
officers' roguish tricks and embezzlement, and a very good thing 
too that it 'will have turned out thus'. The beastly old girle and her 
cliques will do the rest. The less we concern ourselves about the 
whole filthy business, the better.  LET IT  ROT AND BE DAMD TO  IT. 
I find the Social-Demokrätchen 1 more repugnant with every 
passing day. That shitty Hess, who is, in relation to us, really 
acting like a secret employee of Lassalle, with his protectorial airs; 
Mr Schweitzer's bloody pretentious articles on the encyclical and 
Bismarck, flirting with every kind of trash and only scolding the 
bourgeoisie, g the complete lack of sparkle and talent, and the 
absence even of any common sense, with just a few exceptions, it 
is all a bit too much for me. Lassalle-worship three times a week,

As good luck would have it, in the feuilleton section in the

my 'aesthetic' sense tells me—on further reflection—that the 
latter would not be entirely appropriate, because it would come too 
soon after Becker's APPEAL.120 These few lines, on the other hand, 
will quite certainly provoke a real tussle between Schweitzer and 
Red Becker etc., in which we can then intervene and declare our 
policy briefly, forcefully and without any beating about the bush. 
I enclose letter from the unfortunate Liebknecht 12fi and note 
sent him by the old Hatzfeldt woman; there is still not enough 
'Lassalle' in the paper 3 for her liking. 
As TO Klings, I am not going to answer at all. Let the fellows

Letter from Schily just received (can only send it to you in a few 
days time), from which it emerges: 
1. that Moses'L insinuations were pure invention, 
2. that our plan will have a 'fantastic' effect in Paris, and the 
workers there are not taking any notice whatsoever of L'Associa­
tion, which Mr A. Horn, Lob Sonnemann and other riff-raff use 
to indulge their self-importance. 95

Liebknecht's private address is: '13 Neuenburger Strasse, 
Berlin'. You can send to Mrs Liebknecht at that address whenever 
you want to write privately. Poor W. Liebknecht is obviously in an 
exceedingly embarrassing situation. He will have to be told that it 
is a case of either bending or breaking. In the latter case, I should 
think he could certainly earn an honest living as a schoolmaster in 
Manchester.

Dear Moor, 
Statement" enclosed. They will take exception to the fact that we 
refer to Mosesb  by name, which, when published, could be 
regarded as a breach of editorial secrecy. Do not forget to give 
Liebknecht instructions about this, so that a justifiable technical 
objection of this kind does not delay the matter again. 
Liebknecht is becoming more and more stupid. He calls it a 
compromise that we should not merely sanction in silence every 
stupid thing that appears in the paper c but also tolerate the paper 
casting aspersions on our own affairs and actions,126  in defiance of 
every convention. But we always have a fine  LOT  of agents to act 
for us and will certainly not be such jackasses as Lassalle and 
'bequeath' anything to them, s'il y avait de quoi. d If things go wrong 
in Berlin, Liebknecht would do best to come over, leaving his 
family behind, we will then see what can be done, he will be able 
to make acquaintances soon enough at the Schiller Institute 28 
here,  and whatever else can be done, will be; I think he might 
very well manage to settle down here like that, and if not, nothing 
is lost, and if it works out all right, he can bring his family over 
later. If he brings his family along straightaway, he will certainly go 
to the dogs here, because the cost will then be so much greater 
that the attempt cannot possibly last long. It will not be easy to 
obtain work teaching children, as Lupus did; but he can, of 
course, explore the possibilities. 
Bender has sent me a bill for 5s. per quarter for my 
subscription to the Social-Demokrätchen, which seems exorbitant to 
me. 
The devil knows how one's work here is subject to all kinds of 
interruptions. Another committee meeting of the Schiller Institute

managed to get down to the military question.'

The attempt by Hatzfeldt and Klings to throw out Bernhard 
Becker has been a complete fiasco, and Klings has been thrown 
out. Whatever happens we must avoid soiling our hands in that 
dirty business; it is just as the worker said in the Gurzenich a in 
1848:  they may fall as they will, a rogue will always come out on 
top. 
What mad German Schweitzer writes 'as who'! This second 
LEADER on Bismarck's ministry is once again as pretentiously 
abstruse as it could possibly be, even though there is no longer any 
direct flirtation with Bismarck, and it is good that he openly calls 
Prussia's policy anti-German}' But how naive of Liebknecht that he 
demands that we ought to make clear to them what their attitude 
to the government should be, whereas what he should do is to ask 
above all for a categorical statement from Mr Schweitzer as to what 
attitude he intends to adopt towards the government. 
It looks to me as if a compromise is at hand in Prussia now, with 
the Prussian Chamber rescuing its prerogative regarding the 
budget, but giving way on everything  else.  Bismarck will certainly not 
think of seriously disputing the budget-prerogative in the long 
run, since, if he did so, he would get neither money nor credit 
and he is badly in need of both. Meanwhile, the affair can still 
founder on any number of trivial details.100 
In America, the start of the Richmond campaign in March or 
April will probably be decisive for the whole year.30  If Grant 
succeeds in driving Lee out, the CONFEDERACY is PLAYED OUT, their 
armies will break up, and only bandit-warfare, like that already 
rife in West Tennessee now and in general nearly everywhere, will 
remain to be overcome. In reality, the only army the SOUTHERNERS 
now have is Lee's; everything depends on its destruction. Now we 
can already assume that the area from which Lee procures his 
supplies is confined to South Virginia, the Carolinas and at most 
part of Georgia.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 9 February 1865 
Dear Moor, 
Manuscript enclosed, now swollen to the dimensions of a 
full-sized pamphlet" and no doubt now quite unsuitable for the 
little paper.6 So far, it has only been very cursorily revised and will 
have to be gone through again. Regarding the military question, 
some statistics about the population fit for military service have yet 
to be inserted, and some more about the petty bourgeoisie at the 
end, which I quite forgot in the 'heat of battle'. You will notice, by 
the way, that the piece has been thrown together straight out of 
my head, without any kind of literary sources, since it had to be 
finished quickly. I now await your comments on it. 
But where next with it? To Liebknecht or to Siebel, to find a 
publisher? What do you think? Best outside Prussia, probably, or 
do you think there is nothing in it that might lead to confiscation? 
I have lost all my instinct for the publishing situation in Prussia. 
Let me know your opinion on this point, too—the possibility of 
publication in Prussia. 
Another S. D. (Sow's Dirt)c has just arrived. What a lot of feeble 
whining about the position of the party. No cut or thrust at all. 
For ever keeping the little back-door open for Bismarck. Peaceful 
collaboration! And then Moses,d who has come round to the point 
of view that the bourgeoisie and the government in France are 
vying with each other to do the right thing by the workers. France 
these days is a real paradise for Moses. It is a bit too much even 
for Schweitzer to stomach, he has put a ? after it. 
Should I leave that section in III in, about the present workers' 
movement? 
It seems to me that Roon's speech really does imply compro­
mise.  The man is prepared to negotiate.127 For that reason, the piece 
a The Prussian Military Question and the German Workers' Party - b  Der Social-
Demokrat - c Engels is referring to Der Social-Demokrat, No. 19, 8 February 1865,

MARX  TO  ENGELS 29 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  10 February  1865 
Dear FREDERICK, 
The thinga  is good. Although  the  style  is too  slapdash  in places,  it 
would  be  NONSENSE  to polish  or elaborate  it at all now, as the  main 
thing is to get it out  IN THE  NICK  OF TIME,  as the conflict  10° is 'all ready' 
on the  point  of being resolved. 
My advice therefore  is this: 
Send  the  pamphlet straight  to Meissner  in Hamburg  and  tell him 
that speed  of publication  is paramount;  and he  should  let you  know 
immediately whether  he will take  it (leaving  him to  decide  the fee), 
because then  you  would attract attention  to the  thing  in advance  in 
the Berlin  and  Rhineland papers. 
The thing  is much  too  long  and 'too  cheeky'  for the 
Social-Demokrat  in present circumstances.  But I  would arrange  for 
notices, short ones,  in the  Social-Demokrat (through Eccarius),  in 
the Düsseldorfer Zeitung through Siebel,  and maybe even send  a 
notice  to the  Rheinische Zeitung,  to the  effect that  a pamphlet  by 
you is being published  at such  and  such  a place,  in which  you are 
simply setting  out our  position  on  this specific question,  as 
opposed  to  that  of the  Reaction,  men of  Progress"  and 
Lassalleans, along with treatment  of the  PURELY MILITARY QUESTION. 
Even  if there  are  still things  you  have  got to add to it,  send  the 
manuscript IMMEDIATELY  ad Meissnerem (Hamburg)  all the  same  and 
tell him  that  a few  additions  are to  follow relating  to such-and-
such page  (you can  mark  the  places). There should have been 
a F. Engels,  The Prussian Military Question  and the  German Workers' Party. 

=====第123页=====
41. Marx to Engels. 10 February 1865 85 
rather more mention of the country  people,  which your German lout 
is far too inclined to ignore as non-existent. To judge by Strohn's 
last letter, he himself is probably away from Hamburg again, so 
that the piece cannot be sent to him but will have to go direct to 
Meissner. 
An evil wind of reconciliation is blowing in Berlin, fanned from 
the direction of Russia this time and further strengthened by the 
turn for the worse in the business with Austria. The Petersburger 
Zeitung advises unconditionally making concessions to the chamber 
in the matter of budget-approval and two-year military service. It says, 
amongst other things: 
'The present time appears to us, if not an alarming one, then, nevertheless, a 
grave one, and if circumstances do not become especially advantageous, it is still to 
be feared that the future will be dismal. In times of distress and danger, however, as 
history has proved only too often, the strict enforcement of discipline in the army and the 
civil service is rarely enough on its own. The real power of the state is then based, as it 
always is in general, far more on the unity of government and people. Although we 
do not underestimate the conciliatory manner, in which the government approached 
the people's representation in this year's session, nevertheless, in view of what we 
have just said, we cannot suppress the desire that this conciliatory spirit may also 
spread to action.'a 
It appears that the Muscovites need their Prussians for the 
wheeling-movement they are about to execute against Austro-
Galicia, as announced in the Moscow Newspaper^ According to the 
same Moscow Newspaper, this final subjugation of Poland, which 
however necessarily means the ruthless continuation of Muraviov's 
policy, would 'open a hole into the heart of Germany'. Our good 'men 
of Progress' and equally good 'Lassalleans' are missing all that by 
sleeping.

DEAR FRED, 
It being Saturday today,  I am  assuming  you  won't  be sending 
off your thingd this very  day, so  there will still  be time  for  these 
'supplementary' suggestions  for  changes: 
1. In the  passage where  you ask  what  the workers want?  I would 
not answer  as you do  that  the  workers  in Germany, France  and 
a information bureau  - b See  this volume,  p. 73. - c 'President Lincoln  and the

England are demanding this and that. The answer sounds as 
though (at least, that's what it will be taken to mean) we have 
accepted IzzyV slogans. I would be inclined to say rather b: 
It would seem that the demands put forward at the present 
moment by the most advanced workers in Germany amount to the 
following, etc. This doesn't commit you at all, which is all to the 
good, as later on you yourself criticise universal suffrage if not 
accompanied by the requisite conditions. (Morever, in England 
e.g., etc., the word 'direct' would indeed be meaningless, it is after 
all only the opposite of the 'indirect' suffrage invented by the 
Prussians.) The form in which the louts in Germany conceive of 
state intervention à la Lassalle is such that one must ANYHOW take 
care not to identify oneself with 'same'. It would be a lot more 
dignified (and safer), if you took the louts at their word and let 
them say for themselves what they want. (I say the louts because they 
are the really argumentative section who have been infected by 
Lassalle.) I29 
2. I would not say that the 1848-49 movement failed because the 
bourgeois opposed direct universal suffrage. What happened was 
rather that this was proclaimed by the people of Frankfurt to be 
an ancient German right and proclaimed by the Imperial Regentc 
with all due formality.130 (In my opinion, too, as soon as the matter 
comes up for serious discussion in dear old Germany, this 
franchise must be treated as a rightfully existing law.) As that is no 
place for a lengthy exposition, I would make do with the following 
phrase: that the bourgeois at that time preferred peace and 
servitude to the mere prospect of struggle and freedom, or 
something of that sort. 
Taken as a whole, it's a very good piece, and 'Oi' am particularly 
tickled by the passage which shows that the present louts' movement 
IN FACT only exists par la grâce de la police. 
In great haste. 
Salut.

ENGELS TO MARX' 18 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 13 February 1865 
Dear Moor, 
Your SUGGESTIONS came just in time yesterday and have both been 
used. How necessary the one about the demands of the louts in 
particular was,3  was further brought home to me by Nos. 20 and 
21 of the Sow's-Dirt b which arrived today. 
By the by, our attitude seems to be bearing fruit in spite of 
everything. There is a certain revolutionary note in No. 21 which 
was entirely absent before. By the by, I've written to Liebknecht 
that there's no point in raising a storm, they must just drop their 
flirting with reaction and make sure the aristocracy and reaction 
get their SHARE, too, but for the rest abuse neither them nor the 
bourgeoisie, which is superfluous in quiet times. 131 
But one can see that Izzyc has given the movement a 
Tory-Chartist character,132  which it will be difficult to get rid of 
and which has given rise to a tendency in Germany which was 
previously unheard of among the workers. This nauseating 
toadying to the reaction comes through everywhere.  WE SHALL  HAVE 
SOME TROUBLE WITH THAT. You wait and see, the louts will be saying, 
what's that Engels after, what has he been doing all the time, how 
can he speak in our name and tell us what to do, the fellow's up 
there in Manchester exploiting the workers, etc. To be sure, I

Dear Engels, 
You'll see from the enclosed how things stand with regard to 
our statement3 about Moses.133 At the same time, you will have 
read Moses' scrawl in the last Social-Demokrat.b 
This time I believe Liebknecht is right: Mr von Schweitzer is 
pretending to see in our statement only a personal attack on 
Moses; he 'overlooks' the stand against Bonapartism, etc., probably 
knowing full well WHAT  HE IS ABOUT.  It might perhaps not come amiss 
to Schweitzer if a public break (who knows whether he has 
committed himself to something which will soon force one or not?) 
were occasioned by this Moses business, instead of ad vocem" 
Bismarck} I have therefore written him letter (copy retained 134) in 
which I  d'abord A give him a summary of our relations to date and 
ask him where in all this we for our part have gone 'beyond the 
bounds'? And I analyse the Moses  CASE  once more. I then say that 
because of Moses' latest silly outburst, our statement is to  A CERTAIN 
DECREE out-of-date, and the matter can therefore be allowed to rest.

As far as the other point in the statement is concerned, the hint to 
the workers, we would be setting out our position at length 
elsewhere on the attitude of the workers towards the Prussian 
government. At the same time, I took the opportunity—apropos 
of the telegram in today's Times about the Prussian ministerial 
statement—to make our opinion  quoad"  Bismarck and Lassalle I35 
clear to Mr von Schweitzer once again. 
(I would in fact not be at all surprised if Bismarck were to reject 
outright the repeal of the Combination Laws to the extent that 
some of the men of Progress " have now been obliged to demand. 
The right of combination, and all that it entails, interferes too 
much with police domination, the Rules Governing Servants,136 the 
flog-'em and birch-'em rural aristocracy and bureaucratic tutelage 
in general. As soon as the bourgeoisie (or some of them) appear to 
turn serious, the government will certainly make a joke and do a 
volte-face.b The Prussian state can not tolerate COALITIONS and TRADES 
UNIONS. That much is certain. On the contrary, government support 
for a few lousy co-operative societies suited their dirty game to a 
tee. Officials becoming even more nosey, control of 'new' money, 
bribery of the most active of the workers, emasculation of the 
whole movement! However, since the Prussian government is so 
short of money just now, this plan is scarcely more to be feared 
than the Order of the Swan of old!137 
Nota bene, Lassalle was opposed to the campaign for the right of 
combination. Liebknecht improvised it among the Berlin printers 
against Lassalle's wishes. That was the starting-point of the whole 
affair that beau Becker c has now taken over.13") 
For the present we should—in my opinion—exercise 'restraint' 
quant aud the Social-Demokrat. I.e. write nothing (Eccarius excepted). 
Things will soon reach such a pass that we shall either have to 
break openly with it, or we shall be able to collaborate with it in a 
proper manner. Moses will have to receive his chastisement on 
some later occasion. 
MEANWHILE, I am delighted that you have got into the swing again. 
You are by nature always able to get back to working at speed. I 
take it my letter came in time?e 
As long as these abominable Lassalleans rule the roost in 
Germany, that country will be infertile ground for the 'INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION'. For the present, we must be patient. The

MARX TO VICTOR LE LUBEZ 1 
IN LONDON 
London, 15 February 1865 
My dear Lubez, 
The very success of our association warns us to be cautious. In 
my opinion, M. Beales joining our council would spoil the whole 
affair." I believe him an honest and sincere man; at the same time, 
he is nothing and can be nothing save a Bourgeois politician. He is 
weak, mediocre and ambitious. He wants to stand for Marylebone 
at the next Parliamentary election. By that single fact he ought to 
be excluded from entering our committee. We cannot become le 
piédestal for small parliamentary ambitions. 
You may be sure that if Beales is admitted le ton cordial, sincère et 
franc b that distinguishes now our Debates, will be gone, and make 
place to word-mongering. In the wake of Beales will follow Taylor, 
this unbearable nuisance and tufthunter. 
In the eyes of the world, Beales' admission will change the 
whole character of our society, we will diminish into one of the 
numerous societies which he favours with patronage. Where he 
has driven in the wedge, others of his class will follow, and our

efforts, till now successful at freeing the English working class 
movement from all middle class or aristocratic patronage, will have 
been in vain. 
I know beforehand that if Beales be admitted, there will arise 
questions mainly of a social sort, which will force him to tender his 
demission. We will have to issue manifestos on the land question, 
etc., which he cannot sign. Is it not better not to let him instead of 
giving him afterwards an opportunity of denying us.a 
I know that after the foolish step taken by Mr Dell,b there will 
be certain difficulties in ensuring this candidature. 
I would think that by means of quiet talks with the chief English 
members, the whole question could be [settled]' before it is put 
before the committee again. 
Yours fraternally 
K. Marx 
Apropos. For all his enthusiasm for Poland, Mr Beales has as yet 
done nothing other than follow the Duke ...d in throwing all the 
demonstrations for Poland into confusion. Yesterday, he at­
tempted the same trick again, under similar instigation.

DEAR FRED,

an earlier one from Schweitzer. 
My view is this:

pamphlet d is on the stocks.

I consider Schweitzer to be incorrigible (probably has a secret 
arrangement with Bismarck). 
What confirms me in that view is 
1. the passage I have underlined in his letter of 15th 
enclosed 144; 
2. the timing of the publication of his 'Bismarck III'.145 
To do justice to both points, I shall now copy out for you word 
for word a passage from my letter to him134 of 13 February: 
'...since our statement3 has become partially out-of-date, follow­
ing the correspondence from M. Hess in No. 21 received today, 
we will allow the matter rest there.125 Our statement did, of course, 
contain another point as well: praise of the anti-Bonapartist stance 
of the Parisian proletariat and hint to the German workers that 
they should follow this example. We regarded this as more 
important than our sally against Hess. Meanwhile, we shall set out 
our views in detail elsewhere on the relation of the workers 
towards the Prussian government.11 
'In your letter of 4 February you say that I warned Liebknecht 
myself not to overstep the mark, so that he would not be sent to 
the devil. Quite right. But I wrote to him at the same time that 
one could say anything if one put it in the right way. c A form of 
polemic against the government which is "possible" even for the 
Berlin meridian is certainly very different from flirting with the 
government or even pretending to compromise with it! I wrote to 
you myself that the Social-Demokrat must eschew even the 
appearance of doing  so.121 
'I see from your paper that the ministry is making ambiguous 
and procrastinatory statements with regard to the repeal of the 
Combination Laws. On the other hand, a Times telegram reports 
that it was in favour of the proposed state aid for the co-operative 
societies.d It would not surprise me at all if The Times had for 
once telegraphed a correct report! 
'Combinations and the TRADES UNIONS they would give rise to are 
of the utmost importance not merely as a means of organising the 
working class for the struggle against the bourgeoisie—just how 
important is shown among other things by the fact that even the 
workers of the United States cannot do without them, in spite of 
franchise and republic—but in Prussia and indeed in Germany as 
a whole the right of combination also means a breach in the 
domination of the police and the bureaucracy, it tears to shreds

the Rules Governing Servants ,36 and the power of the aristocracy 
in rural areas, in short, it is a step towards the granting of full civil 
rights to the "subject population" which the Party of Progress," 
i.e. any bourgeois opposition party in Prussia, would be crazy not 
to be a hundred times more willing to permit than the Prussian 
government, to say nothing of the government of a Bismarck! As 
oppossed to that, however, the aid of the Royal Prussian 
government for co-operative societies—and anyone who is familiar 
with conditions in Prussia also knows in advance its necessarily 
minute dimensions—is worthless as an economic measure, whilst, 
at the same time, it serves to extend the system of tutelage, 
corrupt part of the working class and emasculate the movement. 
Just as the bourgeois party in Prussia discredited itself and 
brought about its present wretched situation by seriously believing 
that with the "New Era" the government146 had fallen into its lap 
by the grace of the Prince Regent," so the workers' party will 
discredit itself even more if it imagines that the Bismarck era or 
any other Prussian era will make the golden apples just drop into 
its mouth, by grace of the king. It is beyond all question that 
Lassalle's ill-starred illusion that a Prussian government might 
intervene with socialist measures will be crowned with disappoint­
ment. The logic of circumstances will tell. But the honour of the 
workers' party requires that it reject such illusions, even before 
their hollowness is punctured by experience. The working class is 
revolutionary or it is nothing.' 
WELL! He replied to this letter of mine of 13th with his letter of 
15th, in which he demands that in all 'practical' questions I should 
subordinate myself to his tactics; he replies with 'Bismarck IIP as a 
fresh specimen of these tactics!! And really it now seems to me 
that the impudent manner in which he raised the question of 
confidence apropos of the statement against Hess was not due to 
any tenderness for Moses but to the firm resolution not to give 
space in the Social-Demokrat under any circumstances to our hint to 
the German workers. 
So, as a break must be made with the fellow after all, it had best 
be done at once. As far as the louts in Germany are concerned, 
they can scream as much as they like. Those of them who are any 
good will after all have to rally round us sooner or later. If the 
statement given below seems all right to you, make a copy of it, 
sign it and send it to me. As it was scrawled in great haste, alter

To the Editor of the 'Social-Demokrat' 
The undersigned promised to contribute to the Social-Demokrat 
and permitted their being named as contributors on the express 
condition that the paper would be edited in the spirit of the brief 
programme submitted to them. They did not for a moment fail to 
appreciate the difficult position of the Social-Demokrat and 
therefore made no demands that were inappropriate to the 
meridian of Berlin. But they repeatedly demanded that the 
language directed at the ministry and the feudal-absolutist party 
should be at least as bold as that aimed at the men of Progress." 
The tactics pursued by the Social-Demokrat preclude their further 
participation in it. The opinion of the undersigned as to the royal 
Prussian governmental socialism and the correct attitude of the 
workers' party to such deception has already been set out in detail 
in No. 73 of the Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung of 12 September 1847, 
in reply to No. 206 of the Rheinischer  Beobachter*  (then appearing 
in Cologne), in which the alliance of the 'proletariat' with the 
'government' against the 'liberal bourgeoisie' was proposed. We 
still subscribe today to every word of the statement we made then. 
I'll send the Weydemeyer back to you tomorrow. What do you 
say to the 'Freiligrath-Blind' Eidgenossenschaft^ 147

Dear Sir, 
Your kind letter of 17th inst. has only just been delivered to me, 
since postal communication via Ostende has been interrupted for 
three full days, and I am greatly obliged to you for your prompt 
agreement to publish, and more especially for your rapid 
prosecution of the printing. 3 
I accept your fee of 2 louis-d'or per sheet of print and likewise 
leave it to you to decide the number of copies to be printed, under 
the condition, however, that you inform me of it in your next 
letter; it goes without saying [that I] am only making [over the first 
impression] b for this fee. 
Announcements in the nfewspapers shall be] attended to 
forthwith. 
The apparent delay in [despatch] here, to which you justifiably 
allude, arose from the following: I finished on Saturday evening, 
11 February, and wrote the accompanying letter late that night; 
the letter was taken to the post on Monday 13th at 10.00 a.m. and 
went by the mail-boat from Dover that Monday evening—no later 
than it would have done if I had posted it on Saturday evening. 
The pious English do not allow mail-steamers to leave on Sunday

Haverstock Hill 
Dear Friend, 
Yesterday I received your letter, which I found most interest­
ing, and will now reply to the various points. 
First of all, I shall briefly describe my attitude towards Lassalle. 
Whilst he was pursuing his agitation, our relations were sus­
pended, 1. on account of his bombastic self-adulation, which he 
managed to combine with the most shameless plagiarism of 
writings by myself and others; 2. because I condemned his political 
tactics; 3. because, even before he began his agitation, B0 I had fully 
explained and 'proved' to him here in London that direct socialist 
intervention by a 'Prussian state' was an absurdity. In his letters 
to me (from 1848 to 1863), as well as when we met personally, he 
had always declared himself a supporter of the party I represent. 

=====第140页=====
102 53. Marx to Kugelmann. 23 February 1865 
As soon as he had become convinced in London (at the end of 
1862) that he could not play his game with me, he resolved to set 
himself up as 'workers' dictator' against me and the old party. In 
spite of all that, I acknowledged his merits as an agitator, although 
towards the end of his brief career even that agitation appeared to 
me in an increasingly dubious light. His sudden death, our 
friendship of old, the grief-stricken letters from Countess Hatz-
feldt, my indignation at the cowardly impudence of the bourgeois 
papers towards the man they had feared so much while he was 
alive, all these things induced me to publish a short statement 
attacking that wretch Blind3 but not dealing with the substance of 
Lassalle's doings (Hatzfeldt sent the statement to the Nordsternh ). 
For the same reasons, and in the hope of being able to drive out 
those elements whom I thought dangerous, Engels and I promised 
to contribute to the Social-Demokrat (it has published a translation 
of the 'Address', 0 and, at its request, I wrote an article about 
Proudhond when the latter died) and allowed our names to be put 
out as contributors, after Schweitzer had sent us a satisfactory 
programme of its editorial  board. 34 We had a further guarantee in 
W. Liebknecht being an unofficial member of the editorial board. 
In the meantime, it soon became clear—the proof of this came 
into our possession—that Lassalle had in fact betrayed the party. 
He had entered into a formal contract with Bismarck (with no 
guarantees of any kind in his hands, of course). At the end of 
September 1864, he was to go to Hamburg and there (together 
with the crazy Schramm and the Prussian police spy Marr) 'force' 
Bismarck to incorporate Schleswig-Holstein, i.e. to proclaim such 
in the name of the 'workers', etc., in return for which Bismarck 
promised universal suffrage and a few spurious socialist meas­
ures. 98 It is a pity that Lassalle was unable to play this farce 
through to its conclusion! It would have made him appear deuced 
foolish and an utter gull! And it would have put paid to all such 
attempts for ever! 
Lassalle got on the wrong path because he was, like Mr Mi-
quel, 151 a 'realistic politician', only on a larger scale and with 
grander aims!  (BY  THE  BYE,  I had long ago seen through Miquel 
sufficiently to explain his conduct to  myself e by the fact that the 
National Association152 offered a splendid excuse for a petty

Hanoverian lawyer to make himself heard beyond his own four 
walls,  in Germany at large, and then to exploit the enhanced 
'reality' of his own self retrospectively in his native Hanover, 
playing the 'Hanoverian' Mirabeau under 'Prussian' protection, 
furthermore.) Just as Miquel and his present friends eagerly seized 
hold of the 'New Era' l46 inaugurated by the Prussian Prince 
Regent in order to national-associate and to fasten on to the 
'Prussian leadership',153  just as in general they cultivated their 
'pride of citizenship' under Prussian protection, so Lassalle wanted 
to play the Marquis Posa of the proletariat to the Philipp II of the 
Uckermark," with Bismarck as intermediary between himself 
and the Prussian monarchy. He was merely imitating the gentle­
men of the National Association. But, if the latter were invoking 
Prussian 'reaction' in the interests of the middle class, he was 
shaking hands with Bismarck in the interests of the proletariat. 
Those gentlemen had more justification than Lassalle, inasmuch 
as the bourgeois is accustomed to regard the interest he perceives 
immediately in front of his nose as 'reality', and as this class has, 
in fact, compromised everywhere, even with feudalism, whereas 
the working class must in the nature of things be genuinely 
'revolutionary'. 
For a histrionically vain character like Lassalle (who was not, 
however, to be bribed with such paltry things as office, mayoral­
ties, etc.), it was a most seductive thought that he, Ferdinand 
Lassalle, might perform a deed for the direct benefit of the 
proletariat! He was, in fact, too ignorant of the real economic 
conditions required for such a deed to be critically self-consistent! 
The German workers, on the other hand, had 'demoralised' too far 
in consequence of the despicable 'realistic politics' with which the 
German bourgeoisie had tolerated the reaction of 1849-1859 and 
watched the people's minds being stultified, for them not to hail 
such a mountebank of a saviour who was promising to help them 
reach the promised land with one bound! 
So, to take up the thread where I left off above! Hardly had the 
Social-Demokrat been established when it became clear that the old 
Hatzfeldt woman was planning to execute Lassalle's 'testament' 
posthumously. She had contact with Bismarck through Wagener 
(of the Kreuz-Zeitung h). She placed the 'Workers' Association' (Gen. 
German),2 the Social-Demokrat, etc., at Bismarck's disposal. The 
a Marquis Posa and Philipp II are characters in Schiller's drama Don Carlos. Here 
Marx calls William I of Prussia 'the Philipp II of the Uckermark'. - b Neue  Preussische

annexation of Schleswig-Holstein was to be proclaimed in the 
Social-Demokrat, Bismarck to be generally acknowledged as patron, 
etc. The whole of this fine plan was frustrated because we had 
Liebknecht in Berlin and on the editorial board of the Social-
Demokrat. Although Engels and I disliked the editorial board of 
the paper, its lickspittling cult of Lassalle, its occasional flirting 
with Bismarck, etc., it was, of course, more important publicly to 
stay with the paper for the time being in order to thwart the 
intrigues of the old Hatzfeldt woman and prevent the workers' 
party from being totally compromised. We therefore put on bonne 
mine à mauvais jeu, 3 although privatim we were constantly writing 
to the Social-Demokrat telling them that they should stand up to 
Bismarck just as much as to the men of Progress." We even 
tolerated that affected fop, Bernhard Becker, who is taking the 
importance bequeathed to him in Lassalle's testament quite 
seriously, intriguing against the INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMENS ASSOCIA­
TION. 1' 
In the meantime, Mr Schweitzer's articles in the Social-Demokrat 
were becoming more and more Bismarckian. I had earlier written 
to him to say that, although the men of Progress can be 
intimidated over the 'Combination question', the Prussian govern­
ment would never under any circumstances concede the complete 
abolition of the Combination Laws because that would entail 
breaching the bureaucratic system, giving freedom of thought and 
expression to the workers, tearing up the Rules Governing 
Servants,136 abolishing flogging and birching by the aristocracy in 
rural areas, etc., etc., which Bismarck could never allow, it being 
altogether incompatible with the Prussian bureaucratic state.c I 
added that, if the Chamber were to repudiate the Combination 
Laws,  the government would resort to empty phrases (such as e.g. 
that the social question requires 'profounder' steps to be taken, 
etc.) in order to preserve them. All this has come to pass. And 
what did Mr von Schweitzer do? He wrote an article in support of 
Bismarck UD  and is reserving all his heroism for such infiniment 
petits d as Schulze, Faucher, etc. 
I believe that Schweitzer, etc., mean it sincerely, but they are 
'realistic politicians'. They wish to take due account of the existing 
state of affairs and not leave this privilege of 'realistic politics' to 
Messrs Miquel et Comp, alone. (The latter seem to wish to reserve 
the right of INTERMIX IURE with the Prussian government.) They 
know that the workers' papers and the workers' movement in 
a a brave face on it - b See this volume, pp. 64-65. - c  ibid., p. 90, 95-96. -

Prussia (and hence in the rest of Germany) only exist par la grâce 
de la police. 3 They thus want to take the circumstances as they are, 
not to irritate the government, etc., quite as our 'republican' 
realistic politicians want to 'put up with' a Hohenzollern 
emperor. As I am not a 'realistic politician', however, I found it 
necessary together with Engels to serve notice on the Social-
Demokrat in a public statement 1' (which you will probably soon see 
in one paper or other). 
You will see at the same time why there is nothing I can do in 
Prussia at the moment. The government there has flatly refused to 
restore my Prussian citizenship.154 I should only be permitted to 
agitate there in a manner agreeable to Mr von Bismarck. 
I prefer my agitation here through the 'International Association' 
a 100 times. The effect on the English proletariat is direct and of 
the greatest importance. We are now STIRRING the GENERAL SUFFRAGE 
QUESTION here, which is, naturally, of quite different significance here 
than in Prussia.165 
As a whole, the progress made by this 'Association' has exceeded 
all expectations here, in Paris, in Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy. 
Only in Germany, of course, I am opposed by Lassalle's successors 
who 1. are stupidly afraid of forfeiting their own importance; 
2. are aware of my avowed opposition to what the Germans call 
'realistic polities'. (It is this sort of 'reality' that puts Germany so far 
behind all civilised countries.) 
Since any person who takes out a card at 1 SHILLING can become a 
MEMBER  OF THE ASSOCIATION; since the French have chosen this form of 
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERSHIP  (ditto the Belgians) because the law prohibits 
them from joining us as an 'association'; and since the situation is 
similar in Germany, I have now resolved to ask my friends here 
and in Germany to form small SOCIETIES, regardless of how many 
MEMBERS there may be in each locality, each member of which will 
acquire AN ENGLISH CARD OF MEMBERSHIP.156 Since the English society is 
public, there is no obstacle to this procedure even in France. I 
should appreciate it if you, too, would get in touch with London in 
this way in your neighbourhood. 
My thanks to you for your prescription. Oddly enough this vile 
disease had broken out once more 3 days before it arrived. So, the 
prescription was most timely. 
In a few days I shall send you another 24 ADDRESSES.0 I have

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 24 February 1865 
Dear Moor, 
I'm a bit concerned at not having heard from you today, in view 
of the furuncles and carbuncles you mentioned, in the most 
interesting places (or rather most interested). I hope you are not 
LAID UP. 
I was particularly disappointed as I hoped to get the explana­
tion—as well as the Weydemeyer—about the unspeakable mess 
the Social-Demokrat fellows made of your speech at the London 
Workers' Society festivity. They make you speak pure S.-D. 
Eccarius never reported that to them.150  This piece of infamy and 
the reprint of the article from the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung 
in the following number, ostensibly about universal suffrage, about 
which it says not a  word* 57 is proof enough for me that the fellow3 
has simply been bought and has the job of compromising us. I 
hope the statementb is on its way. We must not delay a moment 
longer. 
But quelle bête notre ami c Liebknecht, who is supposed to keep an 
eye on the newspaper and never reads it on principle!

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 25 February 1865 
Dear FRED, 
I quite forgot— *you must excuse me—to send back 
Weydemeyer's letter. I enclose it. Ditto a letter of Dr Kugelmann 
with enclosure of wiseacre Miquel's letter. 151 Ditto a prescription* 
from Kugelmann. Oddly enough the prescription arrived just 
after the disease had broken out afresh. (Nota bene, the passage in 
Kugelmann's LETTER, saying I wrote that I wanted to defend 
Lassalle, referred to Blind's attack. 62 I have now told him 
(Kugelmann) the plain truth. 3 Return the letters from Kugelmann 
and Miquel.) I have had the prescription made up and have 
already taken the POWDER, but I would still like Gumpert's opinion 
of it. It's a most troublesome business. Unlike last year, however, 
my faculties are not affected and (to the extent that sitting down for a 
long time is not physically troublesome) I am perfectly able to work. 
Incidentally, I have the feeling in every part of my CADAVER that the 
stuff is about to burst out all over. 
Strohn passed by here. He was still in Hamburg when your 
manuscriptb  came in, in the nick of time to recommend to 
Meissner that he should accept it. Strohn was informed that a 
manuscript from Rüstow on the same topic was rejected. Apropos. 
Have you taken any steps yourself regarding your pamphlet in the 
newspapers, or  AM I TO DO IT? On this occasion, Eccarius himself was 
responsible for the incomprehensible BLUNDER. 150 When his article 
arrived, I wrote to him at once (22 February) enquiring whether 
the thing had been falsified by Schweitzer?111 Quod nonS 
When I sent our statementd  to that jackass Wilhelm' (23 
February), I wrote this to him: 
'In the few brief excerpts, which Eccarius gives from my speech 
at the workers' society/ there are certain things that convey  precisely 
the opposite of what I  said.  I have written to him about it, leaving it

to him  whether  to  correct  it or not in the  next piece  he 
contributes,  as it is not  very important  in the  present cir­
cumstances.'  a 
My letters  to Eccarius  and  Liebknecht have been written  so that, 
if Schweitzer  (who  from  the  private letter  he had  just previously 
received from me b VERY WELL KNEW WHAT HE  WAS ABOUT,  of course) should 
try to use  Eccarius'  BLUNDER  to defend  himself,  we  could  if necessary 
cut off this retraite. 0 MEANWHILE,  I HAVE TOLD ECCARIUS PRIVATELY  not to 
make  any  BOTHER  about  the  whole filthy business until such time  as 
Schweitzer's  own  behaviour requires  it. Eccarius  was  very unwell, 
and that  is probably  to blame  for the  NONSENSE.  On the  other hand, 
I imagine that Schweitzer,  who  already  had  Wilhelm's resigna­
tion  14S in his  possession  and was  therefore prepared  for a 
statement from  us, was  delighted  to accept  the  report,  1. so as to 
show  by  means  of the  passage about Prussia what extravagant 
demands  we  were making  of him, and 2. by  means  of the 
conclusion  to the  report that  we did  IN FACT  share  his  views.  The 
galantuomod  is  forgetting,  by the  way,  that  I have kept copies  of my 
private letter  to him?34 
I have informed Liebknecht that,  if Schweitzer should turn  it 
down,  he  should  put the  thing  in the  Berliner Reform  and  tell 
Schweitzer about this  at the  same time,  and  also that  I have 
simultaneously sent  the  statement  to two  Rhineland papers,  so that 
Schweitzer cannot procrastinate this time.  I have  in fact sent  2 COPIES 
to Siebel, instructing  him to  insert  the  thing  in the  Rheinische 
Zeitung  and the  Düsseldorfer Zeitung  (the  latter being  the  workers' 
paper)  two  days after receipt  of my  letter,  and to  send  us a  report  on 
any comments  in the  local press. 158 So,  this time there  is nothing 
Schweitzer  can do  about  it any  more.  I would  not be  surprised  if 
the Lassalleans, especially  in the  Hamburg Nordstern, declared  we 
had sold ourselves to the bourgeoisie.  BUT  NEVER  MIND! 
The  'INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION'  has managed so to constitute the 
majority on the committee to set up the new  REFORM LEAGUE  that 
the whole leadership  is in our  hands.155  I have  put the  full details  in 
a letter  to E.  Jones.111 
Such  a conflict  has  broken  out in  Paris between  our own 
representatives that  we  have sent Lubez  to Paris  to clarify matters 
and effect conciliation.95  His  CREDENTIALS  state that Schily  has been 
attached  to him as an  adjunct,  and I  have given Schily private 
instructions. 159 We  could have sold 20,000 cards  in Paris,  but  since 
one group  was  accusing  the  other  of  having Plon-Plon behind

them,  etc., the  distribution  of cards  has had to be  suspended  for 
the time being. Under this military despotism, people  are  naturally 
highly suspicious  of each other  (my  impression  is that this time 
both sides  are  doing each other  an  injustice),  and  they  are not 
capable  of sorting  out  their differences  and  reaching  an under­
standing  by  MEETING  or through  the  press.  A further factor  is this: 
the workers seem  to want  to take things  to the  point  of excluding 
any LITERARY MAN,  etc.,  which  is absurd,  as they need them  in the 
press,  but it is  pardonable  in view  of the  repeated treachery  of the 
LITERARY  MEN.  Conversely,  the  latter  are  suspicious  of any  workers' 
movement, which displays hostility towards them.160 
(Apropos these  'LITERARY  MEN',  I am  reminded that  the  workers 
here (English) want  to  make  me  editor when  The  Bee-Hive*  is 
transformed, which  is to  happen  in 3  months time,  and  have 
already informed  me of  this. However,  I shall mull over  the 
matter  in all its  multifarious aspects, before making  a move  in one 
direction  or another.) 
So, what  we  have  in Paris  is, on the one  hand, Lefort  (a  LITERARY 
MAN,  well-to-do into  the  bargain,  in other words 'bourgeois'  but 
with  an  unsullied reputation,  and, as far as La  belle Franceb  is 
concerned,  the  real founder  of our  Association),  and, on the 
other, Tolain, Fribourg, Limousin,  etc., who are  workers.  WELL,  I 
shall  let you  know  the  outcome.  At all  events,  Wolff,  an 
acquaintance,  who has  just returned from Paris, tells  me  that there 
is growing interest  in the  'INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION'.  The  Débats" 
has also intervened  in the  matter. 
As far as the  London  UNIONS,  etc., are  concerned, every  day 
brings about  new  ADHESION,  so that  BY AND BY  we are  becoming  a 
force  to be  reckoned with. 
But that  is where  the  difficulty begins  as well. Already MR  BEAI.ES 
(THE REGISTERING BARRISTER  of Middlesex,  one of the  most popular people 
in London  at present, President  of the  POLISH LEAGUE,9  co-founder 
of the NEW  REFORM LEAGUE,  IN  FACT  THE  GO-BETWEEN  between  WORKING-
MAN and  MIDDLE CLASS,  honest  and  well-meaning  to boot)  has got 
himself proposed  as MEMBER  for our  COUNCIL.  The  opportunity arose 
because  as a  SUBCOMMITTEE  together with  him we  were  to prepare 
the Polish  MEETING  (Marquis Townshend  in the  chair)  for  next 
Wednesday.161 This  was  most unfortunate  for me. I  could,  of 
course, have prevented  the  matter  by force,  as all the  CONTINENTALS 
would have voted with me.  BUT  I DID NOT LIKE  ANY  SUCH  DIVISION.  So, by

means of private letters3 to the  PRINCIPAL ENGLISH MEMBERS,  I have 
managed  to  persuade Beales'  PROPOSER6  not to  bring forward  his 
MOTION  again.  The  'official' reason given  was: 1.  that Beales  WILL 
STAND  FOR  MARYLEBONE  at the next parliamentary elections and that 
our Association must  by all  means avoid appearing  TO SERVE THE 
INTERESTS  OF ANY PARLIAMENTARY AMBITION;  2. that Beales and we ourselves 
can be of  greater assistance  to each other,  if we  sail our  separate 
ships.  Thus,  the  danger  has  been temporarily averted. Incidental­
ly, other parliamentarians, such  as Taylor,  etc.  (fellows,  who  have 
close links with Mazzini),  had  taken  it into their heads  to tell us 
that the  TIME  was not  OPPORTUNE  for a Polish meeting. I answered 
through our  COUNCIL  that the  WORKING CLASS  has  ITS OWN FOREIGN POLICY, 
which  is most certainly  not  determined  by  what  the  MIDDLE CLASS 
considers  OPPORTUNE.  They always considered it  OPPORTUNE  TO GOAD  ON 
THE POLES  AT THE  BEGINNING  OF A  NEW  OUTBREAK,  TO  BETRAY THEM DURING  ITS 
PROGRESS  BY  THEIR DIPLOMACY,  AND  TO  DESERT THEM WHEN RUSSIA  HAD  THROWN 
THEM  DOWN.  In fact, the chief purpose of the  MEETING  is to raise 
money  to  support them.  Are the  poor émigrés (this time mostly 
WORKINGMEN  and  PEASANTS  and thus not in the least  PROTECTED BY PRINCE 
ZAMOYSKI  et Co.) to starve because it appears to the  ENGLISH MIDDLE 
CLASS  JUST  NOW  INOPPORTUNE  TO MENTION EVEN  THE  NAME  OF POLAND? 
Cutting enclosed  by Mr  Blind from  The  Morning Star.162 
Mazzini,  who did  tell Fontana that Blind  was a  liar,  was  absolutely 
furious that  his  Italian Workers' Association 20 here sent  out the 
Italian version  of my  'Address'c into  the  world without  the 
omissions  Mr  Mazzini  had  expressly demanded,  e.g. the  passages

ENGELS TO CARL SIEBEL 
IN ELBERFELD 
Manchester, 27 February 1865 
Dear Siebel, 
Marx has sent you our statement denouncing the Social-
Demokrat in Berlin. 3 In the meantime, to do something positive to 
prevent the people from lumping us together with Bismarckery, I 
have written a pamphlet,b  and O. Meissner in Hamburg has 
accepted it. I should be grateful if you would arrange for a notice 
concerning it to be placed in the Düsseldorfer Zeitung and other 
papers to which you have access, with something like the following 
content: 
A pamphlet by Fr. Engels entitled The Prussian Military Question 
and the German Workers' Party will shortly be published by Otto 
Meissner in Hamburg. It originated at the request of a so-called 
'social-democratic' paper c to the author to express his views on the 
subject in that paper.d  Detailed treatment of the subject, however, 
required more space than a newspaper could command; the 
pro-Bismarck direction adopted by the latest 'Social-Democracy' 
furthermore made it impossible for the people at the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung to collaborate with the organs of this particular 
'Social-Democracy'. In these circumstances, the above-mentioned 
work is being published independently in pamphlet-form... 163 
You will need to act quickly as Meissner has written that the 
pamphlet was already going to be distributed on 24 February. It 
will vex the Lassallean clique most dreadfully, the men of 
Progress" no less so, and not least Monsieur Bismarck. There are 
some most impudent things in it which have previously, for the 
most part, been passed over with tactful timidity. As long as the 
press does not again totally ignore the thing 164 with its fulmina-
tions against all and sundry, the story will have some effect. 
So, be quick now! This is all important. For the Rheinische 
Zeitung I shall supply the necessary material through Dr Klein in 
Cologne. 
Best wishes to your wife. Your

Dear Moor, 
As you had positively promised to take the necessary steps 
regarding the newspapers3  immediately Meissner sent a positive 
reply, I counted on it that this had been done. Meanwhile, today I 
dispatched the necessary to Siebel, b Liebknecht and Klein in 
Cologne (for the Rheinische Zeitung), 163 as there is no time to lose. 
If you have anyone else who can do anything, please write to 
them—PERHAPS  Kugelmann? His letter returned enclosed, ditto 
Miquel whose high-faluting refashioning of the theory into a 
platform for mayoral dignity and bourgeois benevolence greatly 
amused me. 151 It is more or less how Heinrich Bürgers will view

You must excuse me for neglecting my correspondence this

advance, 7ä with endless letter-writing and vain attempts to dispose 
of our STOCK. I think Richmond will be abandoned within a 
fortnight, and, unless by some miracle Lee manages to get a fresh 
respite of 2-3 months, the final, decisive battle will be fought 
within 4 weeks. 30 
I must go home now and write to Meissner and Siebel, who is 
putting himself to a lot of trouble—he says he has sent you the 
statement. 3 I am glad the thing is finally published; still nothing in 
the damned Social-Demokrat of 1 March — presumably, they tried 
to go back on it? 165 It's a load off my mind that we have at last 
made the break with that gang. So, now we have the grand

DEAR FRED, 
Our statement3  is in today's Social-Demokrat. Although claiming 
that the statement from these 'gentlemen' requires no further 
î comment, Mr Schweitzer has, nevertheless, 'anonymously' devoted 
one of his 'bloody pretentious'  LEADERS  166 to us. Lassalle and 
B. Becker, 'President of Mankind', FOR EVER! At all events, I have 
Mr Schweitzer's exceedingly humble letter of invitation, etc. in my 
possession. Siebel has sent 5 newspapers (the Barmer, the 
Elberfelder, the Düsseldorfer, the Rheinische and the Neue Frankfur­
ter) carrying the statement. 158 The enclosed cutting is from the 
Elberfelder. I am glad, firstly, that we are 'out' and, secondly, that 
we were 'in'. If we had not been, we would never have penetrated 
the 'mystères of Lassalle'. 
I have written to Kugelmann (please send his prescription back 
to me) about your pamphlet b (it looks very good in print; if there is 
a 2nd impression, only a sentence here and there would need to 
be altered). Can you send me another 2 COPIES? I would like to use 
Eccarius' good offices to put two short notices in Bender's ragc 
(London) and in the Hermann, but that will hardly be possible 
unless I let them have 2 copies.167 
The 'Polish Meeting' (WEDNESDAY) went off very well, and full, 
although the BOURGEOIS had done everything they could to wreck it by 
declaring it 'iN0PP0RTUNE'.d  168

Affairs in France are very complicated?5 I will tell you about it and 
send you Schily's REPORT (I have to translate extracts from it this 
very day and accordingly inform the SUBCOMMITTEE of it) in my next 
letter. For the moment, I shall just mention that there is  A FIGHT 
between our original workers' representatives and the politico-
social gentlemen (including the boss of the Association3 so 
admired by Moses'5) as to who is to be in contact with us. The 
[French],'  particularly the Parisian workers (although already links 
with 25 other French cities, too) literally regard the London 
COUNCIL as a workers' government 'abroad'. 
Major Wolff has returned after serving his sentence in 
Alessandria. 
Apropos: did I tell you that Mazzini later secretly communicated 
his 'displeasure' to Fontana after all (and his predilection for 
K. Blind, whom he had himself branded as a 'liar' d)? 
Your wine came yesterday; received with THANKS. 
For the past week my brother-in-law6 from the Capef has been 
here again; he leaves next Tuesday. My niece8  from Maastricht 
came with him (daughter of my sister, widow Schmalhausen); I 
shall have to take her back IN ABOUT  A WEEK LATER. 
My old trouble is plaguing me in various sensitive and 
'aggravating' places, so that sitting down is difficult. 
Apropos: is the Lupus affair8  still not quite wound up? Ditto I 
never heard a word from Mr Borchardt about the outstanding 
money he was going to collect in. You will see from the enclosed 
scrawl, which is just one example, how I am being sent claims of 
every conceivable kind, things I had totally forgotten about. This 
is the most recent to have raised its head from the days of the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung. It is something I have to take into account 
in every possible way because otherwise the fellows will make a 
public scandal.' 1 
It seems all up with CONFEDERACY.

What kind of 'PAPERS from the Manchester press relating to the 
COTTON-CRISIS' are you talking about? Surely you mean from the 
RELIEF COMMITTEE32? I have not seen Maclure for some time; as soon 
as I encounter him, I shall have a word with him about it. 
Gumpert does not think much of Kugelmann's phosphate of 
lime.  At all events, it is not a specific remedy. He says you ought 
to take arsenic. Returned enclosed. 
I must now go to the Schiller Institute to chair the Comité. By

capital.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 7 Marche 1865 
DEAR FRED, 
My brother-in-lawf is leaving today to return to the Cape. I've 
got to accompany him onto the ship. So, I'm very short of 
time—hence just the following in the utmost brevity: 
1. Ad vocem* Bruhn. A worker in Paris received a letter from a 
worker in Hamburg saying that Bruhn is slandering us in every 
way he can. Firstly, he says I owe him 60 talers which I never

repaid. Secondly, you and I are said to have sold the Prussian 
government, or rather 'Police-Chief Stieber', a manuscript about 
the refugees.169  The Parisian sent the letter to Lessner, who passed 
it on to me. I replied to Lessner by return of post, for 
communication to the Parisian, that I had never had any financial 
dealings with Bruhn (which I believed at that time to be the case), 
and in general considered that for Bruhn to ever have 60 talers to 
his name was like something out of Munchausen. Furthermore, I 
explained the affair of Bangya and the manuscript, in which 
connection our declaration of April  1853 a in the New-Yorker 
Criminal-Zeitungb  and references to it in Herr Vogt page such and 
such c were to be consulted. WELL! Then Bruhn's letter arrived. So, 
I racked my brains and think I remember the following: in the 
spring of 1849 I came to Hamburg to collect money for the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung. I had just enough in my POCKET to get to 
Hamburg. However, stayed 14 days in a FIRST-RATE hotel. I 
explained to Baron Frisch, who later intended to send us 
donations, that I needed money to pay the hotel bill and my 
return fare. I now have a dim recollection that since I didn't want 
to take the money as a 'PRESENT' from him and he for his part didn't 
want it back, it was agreed that Bruhn, who was just as much a 
scoundrel then as now, should receive it. I had forgotten the 
whole bloody business; however, I now wrote to Bruhn 111 that I 
couldn't remember any financial transaction with him. Since the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung was banned when I got back to Cologne 
from Hamburg and I myself was kicked out of Prussia, it was 
possible that in the whirl of events at the time / had forgotten. 170 
It is still striking that he waited from 1849 to 1865 to remind me. 
But it was a simple matter. He should let me know by letter how 
much he thought he had on me and send me Griibel's address. I 
would then write to Grübel  myself.  If the latter confirmed what he 
said, his demand would be satisfied. This procedure is absolutely 
essential, as I am still uncertain about the matter even at this 
moment, and the way I have been fleeced by claims of this kind is 
really scandalous. 
2. From the  enclosed  from Schily you will see what transpired in 
Paris whither we sent Le Lubez to settle the disputes that had 
broken out there. (We had given Schily ditto  FILL POWER  to 
negotiate, 0 as we were aware of Le Lubez's bias towards Lefort. 95

People's Bank,171  who controls the few Paris Associations and their 
organ L'Association, is with Lefort.) What else happens—which will 
only be concluded this evening, as far as our intervention is 
concerned—in the next  letter." 
3. The things from Siebel returned. It strikes me as most 
unfortunate that he gives London as the origin of the notice put in 
the Düsseldorfer Zeitung? thus exposing me as the presumed 
author.

recent experience we would have to hold back for the present from 
making contributions to any German paper. He would, of course, 
have the same right as any other EDITOR of a journal to reprint 
whatever extracts he liked from your pamphlet.'

DEAR FRED, 
I can only write these few lines today, as I have much else to do. 
The statement from Herwegh and Rustow3 is good. The 
impudence of Mr Schweitzer, who knows perfecdy well that all I 
need to do is publish his own letters, is fantastic. Though what else 
can the wretched cur do? 
As you will already have guessed, the scrawl he quotes from the 
Neue Frankfurter Zeitung is from student 'Blind'. 173 I'm sending you 
the first No. of this  ' lackey'b  of the deposed Kings of Democracy 
and Holloway-type 'SELFADVERTISERS' and 'PUFFERS'. YOU must arrange 
for a few jokes about the fellow to reach Siebel, for him to hawk 
around to the various papers. 
By the by, if there should be a 2nd impression of your 
pamphlet,0  we can, in a short preface, make a brief official 
statement on our position with regard to the Lassalle 
shit and the Social-DemokraU It would be, of course, beneath our 
dignity to take up the cudgels directly with that gang of riff-raff in 
minor journals.

ENGELS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 57 
IN ST LOUIS 
Manchester, 10 March 1865 
Dear Weydemeyer, 
At last I have got down to answering your letter of 20 January. 
I had sent it to Marx who—partly because he was indisposed— 
kept it a very long while, IN  FACT  did not return it until a week ago 
today,3 so that my letter could no longer catch the STEAMER; I was 
too occupied with business on that day. 
My best thanks for your detailed answers to my questions.15 With 
the negligent reporting on militariac in the papers here, I had lost 
the thread of all the 'combined' operations; I found the Red River 
expeditionm quite puzzling and I was not much wiser about 
Sherman's move eastward from Vicksburg,75 as there was no 
mention here of the Southern corps advancing from New Orleans. 
These combined operations with a point of meeting up not merely 
in the enemy's territory but even behind his very lines show 
precisely how crude are the ideas of strategy of a nation that has 
no experience of war whatever. And yet if the noble Wrangel and 
Prince Frederick Charles had not been 2 to 1 in the Danish war9 
they would have got up to much the same tricks. The battle at 
Missunde,75  and the 2 inexplicable 'demonstrations' (to give a 
nameless thing some kind of name, nevertheless) against Düppel 27 
before the assault were, if anything, even more childish. 
As to Grant's conduct at Richmond,3" I am trying to explain it in 
another way. I am completely of the same opinion as you that 
strategically the only correct thing was to attack Richmond from 
the west However, it seems to me—insofar as one can form a 
judgement from such a distance and from such vague reports— 
that Grant preferred the eastern side for 2 reasons: 
1. because he could provision himself more easily there. Whilst 
on the western side he commanded only the roads to Fredericks­
burg and to Tennessee (both crossing areas that had been exha­
usted),  on the eastern side he had the Fredericksburg line, and 
the York and James RIVERS as well. Since the difficulty of supplying 
large armies with provisions has played an important part

=====第160页=====
122 63. Engels to Weydemeyer. 10 March 1865 
throughout the war, I would not like to condemn Grant out of 
hand until I am clear on that score. You reproach him with having 
turned his back to the sea But if one controls the sea and has 
secure points of embarkation (Monroe and Norfolk), then that is 
an advantage. Compare Wellington's campaigns in Spain and the 
Crimean campaign, where the Allies, who had been victorious on 
the Alma, positively ran away from the enemy in order to ensure 
their rear the protective cover of the sea south of Sevastopol.176 
That the possession of the Shenandoah valley was the best way to 
secure Washington is clear. But? The question arises 
2. did Grant (and Lincoln) want to have Washington completely 
secure? On the contrary, it seems to me that with the loose 
constitution of the Federation and the great indifference to the 
war in some parts of the North, Lincoln never seriously wanted to 
drive the Confederates out of Richmond, that, on the contrary, he 
just wanted to pin them down in a position where they 
represented something of a threat to Washington, Pennsylvania 
and even New York. I believe that without that he would have got 
neither the recruits nor the money to finish the war. I certainly 
believe that Grant would have very much liked to have taken 
Richmond in the last 3-4 months, but he has not sufficient forces 
to do so. I see them estimated at from 70-90,000 men and Lee at 
50-70,000. If this ratio is approximately correct, then, with his 
attack acknowledged to be strategically wrong, he has done 
everything possible to frustrate any offensive defence by Lee, and 
to encircle Richmond on at least 3 sides out of 4. For, after 
distinguishing himself amongst all the other generals of North and 
South in the last 2 years just by his brilliant use of counter-attacks, 
I cannot believe that Lee would now abandon this tactic unless 
forced to. It was, however, a stupendous gain for the North if it 
succeeded in pinning down the South's best army at Richmond, in 
one corner of the southern territory, because of a childish point 
d'honneur," until the whole hinterland was cut off and militarily 
disrupted for the South, firstly by conquest of the Mississippi 
valley and then again by Sherman's campaign, until finally, and 
this seems to be the case now, all the Union's available troops are 
marching on Richmond and one decisive blow can put an end to 
the whole business. 
The latest news we have is from New York, dated 25 February, 
i.e. it includes the taking of Charleston and Wilmington, and 
Sherman's advance from Columbia to Winnsborough. This Sher-
a prestige 

=====第161页=====
63. Engels to Weydemeyer. 10 March 1865 123 
man appears to be the only fellow in the North who knows how to 
use his men's legs to win battles. But he must, incidentally, have 
splendid lads under him. I can't wait to see what will happen. If 
Lee assesses his desperate situation aright, he has no choice but 
to pack up and go south. But where to? The only way open to him 
is to Lynchburg and Tennessee; but that would be exceedingly 
hazardous to march into such a narrow mountain valley with just 
one railway, and Knoxville and Chattanooga fortified ahead of 
him. Besides, that would probably mean sacrificing Beauregard, 
Hardee and all other Confederate troops positioned in North 
Carolina, and exposing his flank to Sherman. Or he could advance 
from Petersburg, turn Grant's left flank and march directly south 
against Sherman? Daring, but better; the only way to draw to 
himself the remnants of the fleeing armies, delay Grant by 
destroying the railways and bridges, and fall on Sherman with 
superior strength. If the latter offers battle to this combined force, 
he will certainly be beaten; if he falls back toward the coast, he will 
open up the road toward Augusta for Lee who will there be able 
to make his first respite. But Sherman and Grant would then 
surely join forces and Lee would then again be faced by a superior 
force, this time as good as in open country; for I do not believe 
the Confederates can again concentrate so many heavy guns in 
any one place inland as to organise another Richmond there. And 
even if they were to do so, they would only be jumping out of the 
frying-pan into the fire. Or else—invasion of the North? Jefferson 
Davis would no doubt be capable of this, but that would also spell 
the end within a fortnight. 
Now, however, Lee can only send some of his forces southwards 
as well to join with Beauregard and company and stop Sherman, 
and this seems to me the most probable course. In this case, 
Sherman will probably give them a proper 'drubbing', as they say 
in South Germany, and then Lee will really be stuck. But even if 
Sherman were to be defeated, Lee would only have gained one 
month's respite, and the troops advancing from every part of the 
coast—not to mention Grant's successes in the meantime against 
the weakened Richmond army—would soon make his position as 
bad as it had been before. One way or another, the game is up, 
and I look forward to the arrival of each STEAMER with expectancy; 
there is a positive deluge of exciting news just now. The strategic 
speculations of the numerous SOUTHERN SYMPATHISERS here are most 
comical to listen to, they are all epitomised by the remark made by 
the Polish general Sznayde in the Palatinate who said after every 
rout, 'We are doing exactly what Kossuth did.'

124 63. Engels to Weydemeyer. 10 March 1865 
Incidentally, I am most grateful to you for your explanations 
about military organisation in America, it was only as a result of 
them that I obtained a clear picture of many aspects of the war 
there. I have been familiar with the canons Napoléon for many a 
long year, the English had already replaced them (light, smooth-bore 
12-pounders with a charge weighing i/4 of the ball) when Louis 
Bonaparte re-invented them. You may have any number of 
Prussian howitzers, as they have all been withdrawn now and 
replaced by rifled 6-pounders and 4-pounders (which fire 
13-pound and 9-pound heavy shells). I am not surprised that the 
ELEVATION of your howitzers is only 5°, it was no higher with the old 
long howitzers the French had (until 1856), and, if I am not 
mistaken, the English ones were only a little more. In general, the 
high-angle fire from howitzers has been used for a long time only by 
the Germans; its great unreliability in range-finding in particular 
had brought it into disrepute. 
Now to other matters. 
A Frankfurt lawyer 'von Schweitzer' had indeed established 
himself in Berlin with a little paper called Der Social-Demokrat and 
asked us to write for it. As Liebknecht, who is in Berlin, was to 
join the editorial board, we accepted." But then, firstly, the little 
paper embarked on an insufferable cult of Lassalle, whilst we 
meanwhile received positive proof (the old Hatzfeldt woman told 
Liebknecht about it and urged him to work for the same ends) 
that Lassalle was much more deeply implicated with Bismarck than 
we had ever realised. There was an actual alliance between the two 
which had gone so far that Lassalle was to go to Schleswig-
Holstein and there to advocate the annexation of the duchies by 
Prussia, while Bismarck had rather less definitely consented to the 
introduction of a sort of universal suffrage and more definitely to 
the right of combination and concessions regarding social policy, 
state support for workers' associations, etc. 98 The foolish Lassalle 
had no guarantee whatever from Bismarck, au contraire 13 he would 
have been put in prison sans façon c as soon as he became 
troublesome. The gentlemen on the Social-Demokrat knew this, but, 
for all that, they continued to intensify their cult of Lassalle. In 
addition to that, the fellows allowed themselves to be intimidated 
by threats from Wagener (of the Kreuz-Zeitung) into paying court 
to Bismarck, flirting with him, etc., etc. That was the last straw. 
We published the enclosed statement d and made our exit, with 
a See this volume, pp. 22, 23-24. - b on the contrary - c without ceremony -

Liebknecht doing likewise. The Social-Demokrat then declared that 
we did not belong to the Social-Democratic Party, 166 which 
excommunication naturally did not bother us. The whole Lassal-
lean General Association of German Workers2 has taken such a 
wrong road that nothing can be done with it; however, it will not 
last long. 
I was asked to write about the military question, which I did, 
but, in the meantime, relations between us became more strained, 
and the article turned into a pamphlet,3 which I have now had 
published separately; I am now sending you a copy of it by the 
same STEAMER. TO judge by the newspapers I receive, the thing 
appears to be creating quite a furore, especially on the Rhine, and 
it will, at any rate, make it very difficult for the workers to ally 
themselves with reaction just now. 
The INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION in London is going from strength 
to strength. In Paris especially, in London no less so. It is also 
going well in Switzerland and Italy. Only the German Lassalleans 
are refusing to bite, and in present circumstances least of all. 
However, we are again receiving letters and offers from all sides 
in Germany, a decisive change has taken place, and the rest will 
turn out right. 
The only reply I can make to your wife'sb question is that I have 
not yet entered into a state of holy matrimony.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 11 March a 1865 
Dear Moor, 
Schweitzer's brazenness really is ludicrous. But it does show how 
hard he has been hit by our withdrawalb  and how well he knows 
that very much depends on it for his petty paper. After Herwegh 
and Rüstow have come out in support of our statement/ anything 
can happen. Schweitzer will soon become aware of the effect his 
big talk has had, especially on the Rhine. Siebel has done a capital 
job in circulating the pamphlet. d The Bonner Zeitung has twice 
published long extracts already and is intending to produce still 
more. The Rheinische" has also got a long extract as well. Our 
standing with the Rhineland workers being what it is, this 
agitation-by-clique against us won't get very far. 
Siebel had already sent me the little piece from the Neue 
Frankfurter Zeitung. 173 Student Blind as always. He is having to 
make a couple of phrases of Lassalle's last a whole year. I haven't 
received the lackey 1 yet. 
The legacy business is complete, the LAWYER will send the 
statement of account next week, he has still got approx. 10s. to 
collect in or pay out, he wasn't sure which. So, I can send you the 
money on Monday then.8 Meanwhile, my statement of account 
enclosed, according to which another £g approx. are due to you. 
The ideas Liebknecht has about Manchester! He has got nothing 
to gobble and asks me what a house 'with garden' costs here! The 
fellow is simply soft in the head. Schweitzer, he said, could not sell 
himself to Bismarck because he would have been obliged to use the 
good offices of the beastly old woman. 11 
I'm finding the new movement a terrible fag, by the way. It's 
the devil's own job letter-writing in the evening as well for the 
party and publisher, etc., until 1 or 2 o'clock, after letter-writing 
all day at work.

There is also a certain amount in interest I have got to make 
over to you for the period from 9 November (when I received the

to it today as the cashier has already left and locked away the

the fact that the £633 remained with Steinthal from May until

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 13 March 1865 
Dear Engels, 
There are mistakes in your financial statement, viz. you sent me 
£235 on 8 June, £350 at the beginning of July (the letter enclosing 
the money isn't dated, but I can tell from a letter of 5 July which 
said it was about to be sent) and £200 on 9 November 1864; on the 
other hand, the last £40 itemised on the statement you said would 
eventually follow (in the enclosed letter dated 9 November) but you 
never sent it I hope that you will be able to convince yourself of 
this on checking your books again, and if so, that you will send me 
the money by return of post, before I leave for the continent (with 
my NIECE3), which will probably be at the end of this week.177 
With regard to Schweitzer's brazenness, I have decided on a 
different course. There are some things about which one would be 
glad to enlighten the public but can only do so in response to direct 
provocation, and then one must not miss the  OPPORTUNE  TIME  OF A REPLY. 
And such is the case with Schweitzer's comments connected with 
11 Caroline Schmalhausen

the garbage from Blind.173  I intend to reply in the Düsseldorfer 
Zeitung actually on behalf of both of us, but I shall sign in my name 
alone, as it would be ludicrous to imply you shared responsibility for 
'Achilles', 178 and as I shall be quoting mainly (exclusively, if my plan 
works out) from Schweitzer's letters to me anyway. 
My plan therefore is this: 
Schweitzer is reproducing, in print, the lies put out by the Neue 
Frankfurter Zeitung, knowing them to be lies. (Is the article in the 
form of an editorial in the paper, or what?) Viz.: 1. neither 
Lassalle's name nor any mention of Lassalle appeared in the 
prospectus we received 'printed as manuscript'. (Liebknecht had 
prevented that.) 2. In note of 30 December Schweitzer most humbly 
asks my pardon for so brazenly using passage from private letter 
of condolence, as both introduction and conclusion to his hymn of 
adulation. 3. By means of short extracts from Schweitzer's letters 
from 30 December 1864 to 15 February 1865 (his last letter), I 
shall show that the conflict over 'tactics' was a lasting one from the 
first, trial number 3 right up until we announced our withdrawal,b 
and was by no means a quarrel suddenly picked, as  man-of-
honour Schweitzer pretends, with his support for Blind's shit. At 
the same time, this little mosaic of excerpts from Schweitzer's 
letters will show with what servility this selfsame brute behaved 
towards us, until he suddenly turned vicious on being kicked. This 
will make salutory reading for bourgeois and workers alike (and 
for Rüstow). All in all, good introduction for the break with 
'Lassalleanism', which is in any case inevitable. (Of course, as far as 
student Blind is concerned, if that water-newt should ever  COME  OUT 
again, I shall always treat Lassalle as a dead lion set beside a live 
ass. It is indecent that such an 'uneducated' Baden publican 
should even presume to put himself on a level with a man who has 
studied Heraclitus and the Roman law of inheritance.) 
Let me know by return if you approve of my plan, as I can't 
afford to lose any time.179  (And don't forget to tell me in what 
form Blind's twaddle appeared in the Neue Frankfurter Zeitung.) In 
my opinion, it's necessary. 
Although, unlike you, I don't have the pleasure of correspond­
ing with the Too-Clever-By-Half,c nor of being able to foul his 
nest for him, nevertheless I've been infernally HARASSED just 
recently, quite apart from the furuncles, which won't go away; 
e.g., last night I didn't get to bed until 4 o'clock in the morning.

Besides  my  work  on the  book,a  the  INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION  takes 
up an  enormous amount  of time,  as I am  IN FACT  the  HEAD  of it. 
And what  a waste  of time!  (And it  would come just  now,  with  the 
French business95  and the  election business155 here,  etc., all at the

28 February. Tolain  and  Fribourg here from Paris. Meeting  of 
the CENTRAL COUNCIL,  where they state their case  and  bicker with 
Le Lubez until  12  o'clock  at night. Then reconvene  in Bolleter's 
tavern, where  I had  another  200 odd  cards  to sign.  (I have  now 
got them  to change this stupid practice  by having  our  handwriting 
engraved  on the  plate,  and  only  the  GENERAL SECRETARY 6 signs  by 
hand. Meanwhile,  the  remaining  1,000  cards  OF THE OLD EDITION  had 
to be signed  IN  THE OLD STYLE.)

MARX TO HERMANN JUNG 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 13 March 1865 
My dear Jung, 
Mr Cremer has quite misunderstood me (and I shall write him 
immediately upon that point). I was so far from any intention of 
moving new amendments on Tuesday evening 6 to the old 
resolutions183  that, before the arrival of your letter, I had to-day 
posted to Schily a letter containing the very same resolutions. I wrote 
him at the same time to wait with their communication until 
Thursday next, so as to give Mr Le Lubez the time to fulfil his 
functions, viz. to communicate himself the resolutions. 
What I said to Cremer, and to Fox ditto, was, that if Le Lubez 
and Mr  Wolff,  by their foolish behaviour, had not excited the 
feelings, and killed the time, the resolutions would and might have 
been rédigées in a way more polite on the one, and more logical, on 
the other hand; [so that] f.i. Resolution II (concerning Lefort's 
[defensive ways]) might, by a short phrase, have lost its aspect, 
while Resolution IV concedes too much to Lefort etc. All this might 
have been mended, and I expressed to Mr Cremer my regret that 
it had, after the vote on the contents of the resolutions, not been 
left to the subcommittee 21 to give it the convenient stylistic form.

Yet, I should consider it the  greatest  folly to reopen the questions 
once settled, and which, as far as the substance of the resolutions 
goes,  have been settled in the most fair spirit. I should consider it, 
particularly, quite unworthy of the Central Council to rescind one 
single word after the exhibitions Le Lubez and Wolff have made of 
themselves. Moreover, by my letter to Schily such a course has 
become impossible. 
You will, of course, oblige me by communicating to me your 
résumé historique —but I beg you to understand me well. I shall like 
to read it, as the thing itself interests me, but not in order to 
control your writing. 184 I am convinced beforehand that you will 
not embitter the spirits. I fear Mr Le Lubez has already sent to his 
friends private despatches in that childish spirit. 
Yours fraternally

Dear Moor, 
The business of the £40 is based solely on a statement of the 
business I made out in November, in which this £40 figures as 
'CASH' to you, but undated. I had the impression myself that I had 
not yet sent you this £40, but as I had no opportunity to check, I 
could only go by the memorandum. Today I checked my account 
in the ledger, but I couldn't deduce anything relevant from that 
either. But if you've not had the £40 and, at the same time, I too 
have the vague feeling that that is the position, that's good 
enough, and I've already given the cashier instructions to have the 
money ready tomorrow.

On the question of the statement in the Düsseldorfer Zeitung, 3 I'm 
in complete agreement. Though on the whole it doesn't matter 
at all if Mr Schweitzer occasionally takes it into his head to 
indulge in such barefaced effrontery, I did, nevertheless, find it 
galling that this vulgar upstart rogue should be allowed to get 
away with such behaviour towards us. Furthermore, if his smarmy 
letters aren't published now, they won't be any use at all later. It's 
always nice when someone like that gets the scolding he deserves 
for once. So, do il straightaway, and please ask Dresemann to send 
2 COPIES, so that I can have one. 
In haste.

DEAR FRED, 
There are a lot of things, some of them important, that I want 
to write to you about. But as there's  A VERY  GREAT  DEAL  OF BUSINESS  to do 
in connection with my departure tomorrow,177 just the following 
bare facts: 
The remaining HALVES of the notes received. 
You can send the POST OFFICE order to my wife. 
I've sent off a note from Bender asking for 50 copies, etc., of 
your pamphlet,6  etc., to O. Meissner direct, as I had to write to 
him today. It is possible that Meissner's answer may arrive too late 
for the next Londoner Anzeiger. Since Bender does at present

Workers' Party.

without doubt know best how to disseminate things of this kind in 
England, you should send him a note about the price of the pamphlet 
by return if you can (i.e. if you know it yourself). He will then 
advertise it straightaway in the next number. His address is 8 
Little Newport St., Leicester Square. 
I did a short, highly condensed little article for Bender, such as 
I thought would be suitable for his paper,3 a kind of prospectus of 
contents, and sent Juch conversely, contrariwise and notwithstand­
ing, just your pamphlet  itself,  asking him to do a critique of it in 
his own way and according to his own point of view.b Then I 
received enclosed note from Juch (to be kept). There certainly 
wasn't the time for a critical review. So, I sent the notice originally 
intended for Bender (in today's Hermann) to Juchc (and the 
enclosed message to Bender instead  d). At the same time, I wrote to 
Juch—diplomacy becoming increasingly important—that I 
couldn't meet his request because I was going away, that he should 
print copious extracts in a later number; I would discuss his 
difficulty in finding contributors with him when I returned to 
London. (I am thinking of placing Eccarius there, instead of with 
the Social-Demokrat) I sent him ditto a copy of my statement 
against Schweitzer, although the Hermann won't be able to print it 
until next Saturday's edition (copies sent at the same time to 
Reform in Berlin and to the Düsseldorfer Zeitung"); no amendments 
in the version for the Hermann except a stab at Blind inserted at 
the beginning. 
Bender has written to me ditto: 
'Most obliged and grateful for notice you sent; but we now need a review as 
well.' 
I've passed this on to Eccarius. 
Also enclosed a number of the Rheinische Zeitung sent to me by 
Liebknecht with HIS SPEECH. 185 His wife' has written to mine; they 
are really down on their luck. He still owed the Social-Demokrat 
£5, etc. I can't send him anything at the present moment. 
Nordstern enclosed. You must keep this document. You can see 
these gentlemen are now trying to make out that that wretch 
Schweitzer completely falsified Lassalle. 186 So, my statement against

only hope you will not condemn me unheard. My excuse is that 
for the first few days I was greatly preoccupied in part with an 
accumulation of current business, but in part also with the large 
amount of urgent correspondence, which one always faces when 
one suddenly appears before the public again after long otium cum 
(vel sine) dignitate* and at the same time has such merry 
adventures as we have had with the Social-Demokratchen.34 In 
addition to all that, I moved house, and that momentarily threw 
my papers into some disarray, in which your letter was mislaid; I 
only found it again the day before yesterday and I now hasten to 
reply to you. 
I am most grateful to you for so kindly offering to send your 
Sphinx and other publicationsI87  to Marx and  myself.  My 
bookseller here is Mr Franz Thimm, Manchester, through whom 
you may send everything to me. Sending things via the bookseller 
requires 3-4 weeks as a rule; if you would send me at least the first 
few Nos. in a simple open wrapper by post (it does not cost much), 
I should be obliged to you and will gladly reimburse you. 
Communications for Marx should be sent to me here, and he will 
receive them within 12 hours of arrival. As you yourself rightly 
realise, I could not commit myself at all at this stage regarding 
possible future contributions; let us leave the question open for 
the time being, although, in your case, we are at least not running 
the risk of incurring the suspicion of wishing to rule over any 
section of the proletariat in Germany from England. 
Meanwhile, the involuntary delay in my reply has given me the 
opportunity to obtain your publication on the working-class 
question6; I read it with great interest. I, too, was immediately 
struck on first reading Darwinc by the remarkable similarity 
between his description of the vegetable and animal life and the 
Malthusian theory. Only my conclusion was different from yours, 
viz.: that it is to the everlasting disgrace of modern bourgeois 
development that it has not yet progressed beyond the economic 
forms of the animal kingdom. The so-called 'economic laws' are 
not eternal laws of nature but historical laws that appear and 
disappear, and the code of modern political economy, insofar as 
the economists have drawn it up correctly and objectively, is for us 
merely a summary of the laws and conditions in which modern 
bourgeois society can exist, in a word: its conditions of production 
a honourable (or dishonourable) leisure (Cicero, Oratio pro Sextio,  45) - b F. A. Lange, 
Die Arbeiterfrage in ihrer Bedeutung für Gegenwart und Zukunft - c Ch. Darwin, On the 
Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection.... 

=====第175页=====
69. Engels to Lange. 29 March 1865 137 
and exchange expressed and summed up abstractly. For us, 
therefore, none of these laws, insofar as it is an expression of 
purely bourgeois relations, is older than modern bourgeois society; 
those which have been more or less valid for all previous history, 
are thus only an expression of such relations as are common to all 
forms of society based upon class rule and class exploitation. 
Amongst the former we may count the so-called Ricardian law,188 
which is valid neither for serfdom nor for the slavery of antiquity; 
amongst the latter, whatever part of the so-called Malthusian 
theory can be sustained. 
The parson Malthus filched this theory, like all his other ideas, 
directly from his predecessors; the only part of it which is truly his 
is the purely arbitrary application of the two progressions.189 The 
theory itself has long since been reduced by the economists in 
England to rational dimensions; the population exerts pressure on 
the means—not of subsistence, but of employment; mankind could 
multiply more rapidly than modern bourgeois society can stand. 
For us yet another reason to proclaim this bourgeois society to be 
a barrier to development which must fall. 
You yourself raise the question of how the increase in the means 
of subsistence can be made to keep pace with the increase in 
population; but excepting one sentence in the preface, I find no 
attempt at an answer. We start from the premise that the same 
forces which have created modern bourgeois society—the steam 
engine, modern machinery, mass colonisation, railways and 
steamships, world trade—and which through the unending 
commercial crises are already now working towards its ruin and 
ultimate destruction—that these means of production and ex­
change will also be sufficient to reverse the relationship in a short 
while and to raise the productive power of every individual to 
such an extent that he will produce enough for the consumption 
of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 persons, that enough people will become 
superfluous to urban industry to devote far more manpower than 
before to agriculture, that science will at last be applied to 
agriculture on a large scale as well and as systematically as in 
industry, that those areas of South Eastern Europe and Western 
America which have been inexhaustibly fertilised for us by nature 
itself will be exploited on a far mightier scale than before. Not 
until all these areas have been turned by the plough and there is 
then dearth, will it be time to say caveant consules.,9n 
Not enough is being produced, that is the root of the whole 
matter. But why is not enough being produced? Not because the 
limits of production have been reached—even for today and by 
7-1196 

=====第176页=====
138 69. Engels to Lange. 29 March 1865 
present-day means. No, but because the limits of production are 
determined not by the number of hungry bellies, but rather by the 
number of purchasers with full purses. Bourgeois society has no 
desire, and can have no desire, to produce more. Those 
impecunious bellies, the labour which cannot be utilised with profit 
and is thus incapable of purchasing, fall prey to the mortality 
figures. Let us assume that there is a sudden boom in industry, 
such as is constantly occurring, to enable this labour to be 
employed with profit, then the labour will acquire the money with 
which to purchase, and the means of subsistence have as yet 
always been found. It is the endless circulus vitiosus" in which the 
whole political economy revolves. One takes bourgeois conditions in 
their entirety as one's premise, and then proves that each separate 
part is a necessary part thereof—ergo, an 'eternal law'. 
I was greatly amused by your description of the Schulzian 
co-operatives.191 We have been through all that here in a different 
form, although it is now more or less a thing of the past. People in 
Germany have yet to develop their proletarian pride. 
There is a remark about old Hegel which I cannot let pass 
without comment: you deny him any deeper knowledge of the 
mathematical sciences. Hegel knew so much mathematics that 
none of his disciples was capable of editing the numerous 
mathematical manuscripts he left behind. The only man who, to 
my knowledge, has enough understanding of mathematics and 
philosophy to be able to do so is Marx. That the detail of the 
philosophy of nature is full of nonsense I will of course gladly 
grant you, but his real philosophy of nature is to be found in the 
second part of the Logic, in the theory of Essence, the true core of 
the whole doctrine. 13 The modern scientific theory of the interac­
tion of natural forces (Grove's Correlation of  Forces,  which I think 
first appeared in 1838) is, however, only another expression or 
rather the positive proof of Hegel's argument about cause, effect, 
interaction, force, etc. I am no longer a Hegelian, of course, but I 
still retain a deep feeling of piety and devotion for the titanic old 
fellow.

My dear Countess, 
I shall be obliged if you would hand the copy of the '18th 
Brumaire' with my marginal amendments, i.e., corrections, to Mr 
Wilhelm Liebknecht. 79 
I have read Becker's3  attacks on you with the greatest 
indignation, and, to judge from letters I have received from 
people of the most divergent views, the scoundrel has thereby 
generally done harm not to you, but only to  himself.  I am in 
entire agreement with Mr Rüstow that it is incomprehensible that 
any section of the Association of German Workers could calmly 
listen to such scandalous talk. The most elementary sense of 
decency should make such infamy impossible. 192

enclosed. I had told the latter how it was possible to work with 
Kolatschek's great-German organ supporting Austrian rule in 
Hungary, Poland and Italy, as we would immediately have all our 
friends in the other countries down on us, hence the vague 
reply.195 
I had always half expected that the naive fraternité in the 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION would not last long. If there were an 
active political movement among the workers here, just the same 
SPLITS would occur. It will pass through a lot more such phases and 
will take up a great deal of your time. But it does still remain 
something quite different from Lassalle's Association. 2 
I couldn't resist a hearty laugh when I read in Wilhelmchen 'sa 
letter that the official Berlin community of that Association 
consists of 5 people, as there was recently a perfectly serious 
report in the Social-Demokrat of their transactions, in which they 
congratulated each other on such a large turn-out.b 
Ad vocemc coiTON-crisis, things are looking quite cheerful here. 
Cotton (MIDDLING Orleans) stood at 313/4d in July, was quoted at 
143/4d last Thursday, and today, if one is selling, it hardly fetches 
14d. So, it has depreciated by more than  half.  It was still worth 
27d on 30 December, which is a fall of 12 72-13d in 3 months! On 
top of that, there's been a fall in flax, wool, sugar and all IMPORTS 
GENERALLY, which makes a loss of at least £40-50 mill. stg. You will 
readily understand that all the philistines are in a cold sweat. In 
Liverpool, bankruptcy has altogether gone out of fashion now. Anyone 
who becomes insolvent goes to his creditors (generally people 
there have only a couple), notifies them and offers them such and 
such an amount, which is always accepted at once as they are glad 
to get anything at all and have got to avoid any scandal so that the 
whole rotten edifice doesn't collapse. Hundreds of such settle­
ments are said to have been reached on the quiet, and today 
rumour even has it here that one of the biggest Stockport

we've seen so far is nothing. The bills, which were drawn from 
India against the white cotton, run out in the next 6 weeks, and 
there will be many more besides Joyce who will come to  grief.  A 
lot of people in Scotland are finished as well, and one fine day it's

matter. The spinners and manufacturers are becoming bankrupt 
by the dozen in Austria, too—in the whole of Bohemia only 'the 
great Liebig' is still on his feet, all the others have gone bust—and 
in Poland it's all just starting as well. 
Industry itself is not much affected. The small fry mostly went 
bust ages ago or quietly melted away, and the big ones can operate 
reasonably profitably once more, if they can get any orders at all. 
Among them, the only ones who are going bust are those who 
have bad machinery or who couldn't keep their fingers out of 
COTTON. Everyone is making a loss on their stocks of cotton yarns 
and fabrics. We too could sing you a woeful song about that, twice 
as woeful for me in particular as it would have been if droned out 
last year. That's what comes of being an associé. 3 
Glorious is also the ethics of trade, as at present. You buy 
something today, and by the time it's delivered, it is worth 3, 4, or 
5d a pound less. This leads to all kinds of dirty tricks and 
repudiations, as people try to get out of these unprofitable 
contracts at any cost, and that lands you in interminable 
altercations and squabbling correspondence. I'm sick to the teeth 
with it. You can have no idea how much letter-writing and 
aggravation this entails. 
I hope your wife got the £3? Final statement of account 
enclosed, I'll send the £12 in a few days, it's too late for a POST 
OFFICE order today. 
Best wishes.

Dear Jung! 
* In No. 30 of Der weisse Adler, 223 Münstergasse, Zürich there is 
a report of our Polish Meeting of 1 March. This report must 
have been translated from the Daily News or some other English 
middleclass paper which, intentionally, suppressed the Resolution, 
proposed in the name of the 'International Association', and 
unanimously adopted by the St Martin's Hall Meeting. 
As you are the Swiss Secretary, it belongs to you to rectify the 
report, and to request the Editor of the paper to print the 
notice19b which I translate literally from the Report in The 
Bee-Hive.3 
Yours fraternally*

It goes without saying, dear Jung, that you can change the 
concluding words at your discretion. Since you are plus ou moins b 
a Frenchman, I simply wanted to draft the scheme for you in

[Draft] 
London, 15 April 1865 
Dear Citizen, 
At its last sitting (see enclosure) the Central Council appointed 
me pro interim3  to be secretary for Belgium in place of Citizen Le 
Lubez, whose resignation as Council Member was unanimously 
accepted. Citizen Dupont has taken his place as secretary for 
France. 
I will, if you wish, later give you a brief account of the 
disagreeable incidents which occurred within the Central Council. 
In my opinion, they were really instigated by a person alien to 
our Council, well known as an Italian patriotb but an inveterate 
enemy of the interests of the proletariat, without which repub­
licanism could be no more than a new form of bourgeois 
despotism. Did he not, as one of his most blindly faithful 
followers0 confessed to me, go so far as to demand that all the 
passages hostile to the bourgeoisie should be deleted from the 
Italian translation of our 'Address'.d 
Despite these regrettable incidents and the more or less 
voluntary resignation of several individuals, our Association 
is making glorious headway. Founded only a few months ago, 
today it already numbers almost 12,000 members in England 
alone. 
The Central Council will be much obliged to you if you send me 
an official report on the present state of our society in Belgium. 
In your correspondence please be so kind as to keep the official 
letters, which are destined for the Central Council's archives, 
separate from such private communications as you may be good 
enough to send me.

Dear Moor, 
The Nordsterns returned enclosed. Herwegh and Rüstow have 
certainly acquired a funny Dido b dog in Reusche. The fellow is a 
real comic turn with his solemn declarations. The inevitable oath 
beside Lassalle's dead body makes a precious counterpart to 
Willich's apple-tree.198 It's a real blessing that these people live so 
far away and that they still show a certain reserve in their attempts 
to approach us.

What do you say about Richmond?30 I had expected that Lee 
would act like a soldier and surrender, instead of taking to his heels, 
at least so as to secure better terms for the army. But it's better the 
way it is. He has ended like a scoundrel, and the tragedy closes on a 
comic note.

DEAR  FRED, 
The scribble from the Rheinische Zeitung enclosed. 
I'll write a detailed letter to you tomorrow. I'm as limp as a wet 
rag today, partly from working late at night (nothing practical), 
partly from the diabolical muck I've been taking. 
Dronke would be  ALL  RIGHT,  if I could turn copper into gold like 
he does. As  IT IS, we must utilise the moment when the bourgeois 
papers are competing to print denials of SLANDER which tomorrow, 
if the struggle is being fought in earnest, they perhaps wish to 
have endorsed.

the purpose of the evening. This entre nous!" 
I have just written to Cremer111  that he should issue the letter 
of authority for P. Vinçard immediately, which Dupont must then 
deliver to Vinçard forthwith. It would be best if Dupont could 
despatch the thing to Vinçard direct without it having to go by 
way of Fribourg. 
Vinçard had already written to Lubez that he would not accept 
if he did not receive the POWERS direct from London.' 99 In a letter to 
Fribourg Lubez promised to inform the 'CENTRAL COUNCIL' of this, 
but did not do so. I have reason to believe that Fribourg 
subsequently 'forgot' the matter, not unintentionally. 
I shall give you a verbal account of what further occurred in 
Paris (which was for the most part good); but in the meantime you 
should tell Dupont.

and Jung,  so it  will  be a  political birthday party. Laura  HAD  'THE 
QUESTION POPPED'  by one  Charles Manning, born  in South America, 
English father, Spanish mother.  He's  rich and  generally  a nice 
fellow,  BUT  LAURA 'DOES  NOT  CARE  A PIN EOR HIM'. 'SHE  HAS ALREADY KNOWN 
HOW TO DAMP'  the  passionate southern temperament. However,  as my 
girl is a  friend  of his  sisters,  and he is  frightfully IN  LOVE,  it is A 
DISAGREEABLE CASE. 
I enclose  a 'curiosity'.  The  Nordstern's correction makes  it a 
worthy organ  of the  German louts. 
I am  also enclosing  for  you  THE LATTER END  of a  letter from Schily, 
whose report  on the  Moses woman a will amuse  you. 
The great achievement  of the  'INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION'  is this: 
The  REFORM LEACUE  is OUR WORK.  On the  inner  committee  of 12 (6 
MIDDLECLASSMEN  and 6  WORKINGMEN),  the  woRKiNGMF.N  are  ALL MEMBERS  OF 
OUR COUNCIL  (including Eccarius).' 55 WE  HAVE BAFFLED  all attempts  by 
the middle class  TO MISLEAD THE WORKING CLASS.  This time  the  movement 
in the  provinces  is completely dependent  on  that  in  London. 
Ernest  Jones, e.g., had  DESPAIRED TILL  WE SET THE  BALL AGOING.  If we 
succeed  in  re-electrifying  the  POLITICAL MOVEMENT  of the  ENGLISH 
WORKING CLASS,  our  ASSOCIATION  will already have done more  for the 
European working class,  WITHOUT MAKING ANY FUSS,  than  was  possible IN 
ANY OTHER WAY.  And  there  is every prospect  of success. 
You know that  the  Italian society20  has not  withdrawn from  the 
ASSOCIATION,  but its  DELEGATES  have from  the  CouNciL.b  We  now  have 
Spaniards  on it  instead. ONE  ROMAN NATION FOR THE OTHER.  If those 
fellows don't appoint  new  delegates soon,  as we  have asked them 
to, Bakunin will have  to arrange  FOR SOME LIFE ITALIANS. 
Weber junior'  has  been thrown  out of the  workers' society here 
for making false reports  to the  Social-Demokrat  and  for  stirring  up 
trouble  in the  branch society 'Teutonia', which  is run by two 
fanatical Prussians  by the  name  of Klinker. 200 
Our joint statementd really  was  successful beyond  all  expecta­
tion.  Not  merely have  we  blown apart  the  'General Association  of 
German Workers'2  as an  organ  of the  Prussian government  and  in 
six WORDS  generally cleared  the  heads  of the  German workers  of 
their intoxication with royalty.  The  present split  in the  Party  of 
Progress"  was  also the  direct result  of our  stand. 
The  CHIVALRY  OF THE  SOUTH  has  ended worthily.  In  addition, 
Lincoln's  ASSASSINATION  was the  most stupid  act  they could have 
committed. Johnson  is  STERN, INFLEXIBLE, REVENGEFUL  and as a  former

POOR WHITE  has  a deadly hatred  of the  oligarchy.  He  will make less 
fuss about these fellows,  and,  because  of the  treachery,  he  will find 
the TEMPER  of the  North commensurate with  his  INTENTIONS. 
Did you see how  Blind  HEADS  the  letter  of condolence from  the 
'influential' Germans?201  Blind  is a  genius  in his  way.  IN THE VERY 
NICK  OF TIME  he  does  not  merely  go  running  to Freiligrath,  etc., but 
has enough presence  of  mind  to  realise that,  of the  other 
signatories,  ALPHABETICALLY  'Berndes' would open  the  list. So, he 
runs first  to  Freiligrath,  etc.,  and  gets  him  first  of all to  form  a 
group  and,  after that worthy  (who  is now  at one  with Ruge  as 
well),  certain other  INFLUENTIALS,  I almost said  INFINITESIMALS,  such  as 
Heintzmann  and  Kinkel,  and  puts himself 'alphabetically'  at the 
top. Then  he  goes running  to  Berndes  and  gets  him  to start  a 
second column next  to  himself,  so  that another  lot of  names, 
Trübner,  etc.,  follows  on.  That  is how  the  matter appears  in The 
Times.  In  the  same day's Morning Star  the  second column  is added 
to the  bottom  of the  first, with Blind  AT THE TOP OF THE WHOLE, AND HIS 
FOOTMAN  Freiligrath after  him, etc. And not  content with that,  at his 
instigation,  the  Star of the  same number also carries  a notice  on 
the front page  THAT  'KARL  BLIND  HEADS,  ETC.'. 
Isn't that genius for you?

can one say except repeat the verdict of the Stalybridge jury: SERVES 
HIM RIGHT. 
I'll be sending all the things back to you in a few days time. I 
was very pleased to see in the Nordstern that something has at last 
been started against Becker" and Schweitzer in Solingen, too. 202 As 
all I have seen concerning this business since your departure has 
been the Social-Demokrat and two letters from Liebknecht, I am 
not at all clear as to what has come to pass on the Rhine in this 
connection; from the miserable silence maintained by the Social-
Demokrat about developments in the General Association of 
German Workers, I could only deduce that things must be looking 
bad for these gentlemen. But it is understandable that I really do 
need to know how things stand on the Rhine, especially since in 
the beginning the scoundrels had some momentary success there. 
If you've got any material on it, please let me have it, I'll send 
everything back to you, and in general I will as a rule send all the 
documents back in future because now you need to have this stuff 
together. 
Have you taken out a subscription to the Nordstern? It would be 
a good thing if you did, because we've got to know what's 
happening. 
It is vital for us to have some contacts with the workers on the 
Rhine so that in future we can counter intrigues of that kind from 
the outset. Apropos, peculiar things seem to have been happening 
to Klings. Some jackass gave him my address as 58 Dover Street 
Klings goes there, does not find me, of course, and goes to see 
Rode in Liverpool, and the latter tells Eichhoff I'd pretended to 
be out when Klings called, did not wish to see him, what is this 
supposed to mean, etc., to a man like Klings who was after all 
going to 'organise everything' in America with Weydemeyer and 
the others (which others?), etc., etc. Monsieur Rode, whom I've 
never met, did thereby express his surprise that I had 'not yet' 
sent him a copy of my pamphlet. b Can you understand that? 
The statement attacking the President of Mankind is very good.c 
Just what was needed and no more. 
The worst of it is that the people in Germany will now demand 
that someone assumes the leadership over them, and who can do 
it? Eccarius would be the man, but he won't want to leave London. 
The International Association really has gained an enormous 
amount of ground in such a short time and with so little to-do. But

it is a good thing it is at present occupied in England, instead of 
eternally having to deal with the disorders in France. So, you have 
something to compensate you for the time it's cost you. 
How's the booka going? 
As far as the strategic situation is concerned, at Richmond Grant 
has achieved a precise replica of the battle of Jena,203 and with the 
same result: the whole of the enemy army is trapped.30 Only he 
didn't have so far to march to gather the fruits. 
Johnston has now surrendered, too, so I've won my wager of 2 
months ago: that by 1 May the SOUTHERNERS would have no army 
left. Whoever still offers resistance will be taken in as a BRIGAND, 
and rightly so. At any rate, Johnson will insist on confiscation of 
the great estates, which will make the pacification and re­
organisation of the South rather more acute. Lincoln would 
scarcely have insisted on it. 
The SOUTHERN SYMPATHISERS here are consoling themselves for the 
hypocritical wailing they were obliged to put on over the 
assassination,11 by prophesying that it'll be Grant I, Emperor of 
America, within 4 weeks. What jackasses they have made of 
themselves! 
Incidentally, their 'Majesties'c must be absolutely furious that 
Lincoln's assassination has made such a colossal impact throughout 
the world. None of them has yet had such an honour.

MARX  TO ENGELS 29 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  9 MAY  1865 
DEAR  FRED, 
You need  not  send anything back (except Schily's lettera). Just 
keep  the  things safely.  I enclose  ONE  Free Press  (the  QUEER ARTICLE  on 
the 'RECONSTRUCTION  OF  ITALY'  is from the pen of the  HIGH PRIEST 
himself,  from Urquhartb ), also  two  Nordsterns  (one of  them 
somewhat  out of  date).  I've got a  subscription  to the  latter,  but no 
longer  to the  Social-Demokrat.  The  latest Nordstern will give you 
some idea  of the  situation  on the  Rhine. 204 Incidentally,  the  total 
number  of the  faithful whom  B.  Becker still commands  is barely 
1,000. 
Before  I forget: there were several allusions  to your pamphlet0 
in the  debate  in the  Prussian Chamber. Gneist,  for  instance, said  the 
Minister  of Ward  would  not  persuade them, even  if his  statistics 
spoke with  the  tongue  of 'Engels'. (Laughter.) (That  is how the  affair 
appeared  in the  Berliner Reform.") 
As everywhere,  the  London workers,  of course, also include  A 
KNOT  OF  ASSES, FOOLS  AND  ROGUES, RALLYING  round a scoundrel. The 
scoundrel  in this case  is 'George Potter',  A RAT OF  A MAN, SUPPORTED  by a 
VENAL  but  witty Irishman  by the  name  of  Connolly,  who is a 
dangerous  STUMP-ORATOR.  Although  the  bourgeoisie hate  the  said 
Potter  as  chief  STRIKE-MANAGER,  they  do,  nevertheless, support  him 
against  our  people because they smell  VENALITY  in him,  whereas 
they know that our people are  TRUE MEN.  This Potter  DERIVES HIS  POWER 
particularly from the fact that he is  PRESENTLY  the  MANAGER  of The 
Bee-Hive,  the  official organ  of the  TRADES UNIONS,  although  he  uses  it 
against the  OFFICIAL  COUNCIL  of these  UNIONS  which is in our hands.18 
Since  the  paper  is based  on  shares,  the  idea  is now  to distribute  as 
many  SHARES  as possible  (5SH. PER SHARE)  amongst our workers. For my 
part I have undertaken to collect the  MONEY  for  ABOUT  30 SHARES.  For 
this,  I'm counting on you  (SINGLE HANDED  or with friends) for £5, I 
WRITE TO  Dronke  for £1 and I  will  pay the  rest  myself.  (Although 
my FUNCTION  with the  CENTRAL COUNCIL  costs me a lot of money,

compared with what  I can  afford.)  The  money must already  be  AT 
HAND  this week,  as the  General Meeting  of the  SHAREHOLDERS  is next 
week.  If we are  only strong enough  (and  Odger,  for  instance,  has 
guaranteed  50  SHARES)  to elect  the  DIRECTORS,  we  shall have that 
rogue Potter (who is only the  MANAGER) UNDER  OUR  THUMBS.  This 
matter  is of  decisive importance  for the  whole movement.205 
E. Jones  was  here, very charming  SOCIALLY SPEAKING.  But  between 
ourselves,  he is  only trying  to use our  Association  for  electoral 
agitation.  Of the 12  cards  I sent  him,  he returned  11,  he had not 
sold a single  one,  whereas  POOR  Schily,  for instance, paid  for 24 for 
himself alone.  I told  him he  should just  put  them back  in his 
pocket again,  I would dispose  of  them later,  but I  could  not 
appear  in front  of the  English workers  and  tell them that.  BY AND BY 
HE WILL FIND OUT  that  if only  for  speculative reasons  he  should  not 
have treated  the  business  so  lightly  and  RATHER CONTEMPTIBLY.  I will 
write  to him and  tell him to  hand over  the  'ADDRESSES' 3 to you. 
You can  give them  to whomsoever  you  please. They  are  just dead 
weight with  him.  Incidentally,  I don't take kindly  to the  fact that 
he was  here  to wangle  a job as  RECORDER  out of Sir G.  Grey either. 
Today I am to submit an  'ADDRESS  TO  PRESIDENT JOHNSON.'206  Mr Le 
Lubez wants to return to the  COUNCIL as—DELEGATE  FOR  DEPTFORD, 
the same fellow as resigned as  DELEGATE  FOR FRANCE, h BUT  HIS ADMITTANCE 
(WE HAVE  TO  CONFIRM  THE  DELEGATES) WILL  NOT RUN  QUITE  SO  SMOOTHLY  AS HE 
SEEMS  TO FANCY.  I would be pleased if you could form even just  A BRANCH 
OF 6 MEN  in Manchester,  and  could  get  yourself elected  as their 
CORRESPONDENT  FOR  LONDON.  For  THE  CORRESPONDING  people are eo ipsoc 
MEMBERS  OF THE  CENTRAL COUNCIL,  and have a seat and a vote on it, 
WHEN  AT LONDON. 
New  BRANCHES  have been formed  in Lyon, Neufchâteau (départe­
ment des  Vosges)  and St  Denis.  The  French  BRANCHES  (apart from 
Paris)  are not  linked with Paris,  in view  of the  existing laws,  but 
directly with London. 
I'm hoping  to put the  finishing touches  to my  bookd  by 1 
September (despite numerous interruptions).  It's  going ahead well, 
although  I am  still  not  quite well.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 12 May 1865 
Dear Moor, 
Schily's letter returned enclosed. That passing glimpse of the 
family life of Moses and the Moses womana  was most entertaining. 
Many thanks for the Nordsterns. The reports in them provide a 
check on the negative evidence of the Social-Demokrat, which I am 
keeping on until June (and if it is not being taken anywhere in 
London accessible to you, I am willing to continue taking it, one 
never knows what may happen). 
By the by, the rag in question—i.e., the Social-Demokrat—has 
now gone into such decline that one really feels sorry for it. Poor 
Schweitzer's heroic soul is at its last gasp, every shred of an idea 
and all the fruits of his reading have already been used up and he 
hasn't even a fart left in him to serve up to his readers. Nor is 
Mausesb producing anything any more, Mauses, the last hope of 
the new 'party'.207  'News of the Association' is a complete blank, 
too—literary section re-printed from the Augsburger Allgemeine 
Zeitung. 208 After four months editorship during one of the most 
turbulent periods we have known since 1848, that milksop has 
been pumped dry, right down to the dregs, and those are the 
fellows who wanted to annex the whole German proletariat by one 
trick. 
Ad vocemc Potter: five pounds end., you can take some, i.e., five 
of the SHARES in my name and five in Samuel Moore's, whom I've 
admittedly not yet seen, but he's sure to take some; we'll send you 
PROXY for the general meeting.d If Gumpert also wants 5 SHARES, you 
can pass some of those 20 on to him—so: 5 for me, 5 for Moore, 
the remaining 10 to be distributed to other people, but make sure 
that, if the people are not quite reliable, you reserve the right to 
take them back again. 
As for the suggestion that I should form a BRANCH of the 
International Association here, it's quite out of the question. Apart 
a Moses and Sibylle Hess. See this volume, p. 150. - b Moses Hess. Engels makes a 
pun on the name Moses and the word Maus (mouse). - c concerning - d See this

from Moore and Gumpert, I see no one here,as I can't broach that 
kind of thing with the Kyllmanns or we would have a squabble at 
once.  Besides, my position as its correspondent for London would 
impose all kinds of obligations on me, which I would be unable to 
fulfil as soon as real contacts with the workers were found or arose 
here.  Et à quoi  bon?' 1 I wouldn't be able to take any of the burden 
off your shoulders anyway. 
Apropos. Moses is still up to his tricks against the International 
Association in the Social-Demokrat209; if you haven't read the piece, 
I'll send it to you. 
The number of the banknote is: B/C 48498, Manchester, 4 
January 1864. 
The tongues of Engels, etc., are not a reference to me, as I 
thought myself at first, but to the statistician Privy Councillor 
Engel in Berlin who sorted out the things for Roon which I 
criticised . b 
Jones must be allowed to go his own way. He doesn't seem to 
me to have any real confidence in the proletarian movement any 
more. I can never find him here anyway, he's always away.

CONFERENCE  (NEXT TUESDAY)  together with our  DELEGATES  (Odger and 
Cremer ON THE  PART  OF THE  INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION),  Howell as 
secretary of the  REFORM LEAGUE (BRICKLAYER,  ONE OF THE  MEMBERS  OF OUR 
COUNCIL)  and  Beales  and  Mason Jones  as bourgeois representatives 
of the same  LEAGUE.210 
Without  us  this  REFORM LEAGUE  would never have come into 
existence,  or  else  it would have fallen into  the  hands  of the 
MIDDLECLASS.  The glorious failure of  BAINESS BILL  (which will result in 
a CHANGE  OF  MINISTRY  and the  COMING  IN of the Tories), originally 
SUPPORTED  BY THE  GOVERNMENT, WHICH WANTED SOME SUCH SMALL MEASURE FOR  THE 
HUSTINGS,  occurred  in the  Lower House itself with direct reference 
to the 'extravagant' demands recently put up by the  WORKING CLASS 
(I.E. OUR  MEN).211 
As Dronke wrote me, Reinach I, who is now  MANAGING DIRECTOR  of 
the BANK  OF SWITZERLAND,  will be ruthlessly putting an end to the 
OFFICE  in London, which  is causing nothing  but  expenses. Reinach  I 
is, of  course,  not  bound  by the  same political  and  personal 
considerations  as Fazy212  and  Klapka were.

that d'abord h we had to  wait  for  certain letters  to come, which  he 
had written  to France  at the  time  of the  CONFLICT.213 
I hardly think  the  Social-Demokrat will  see out  another quarter.

up his  prestigious position  as Lassalle's really secret agent  at any

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  20 MAY  1865 
DEAR  FRED, 
Cutting  ENCLOSED  which includes  my  address  to Johnson.3 
Edgar'sb reappearance  did, of  course, surprise  us greatly.  QUITE 
THE FELLOW  I THOUGHT HIM,  and his career quite as I expected it.  IT IS A 
PITY that  he  could  not  always have been right-hand  to Garibaldi. 
He would have suited  him to a  tee.  But the  poor devil  is still very 
weak.  He  will be staying here  for  some time, apropos  of which  you 
could be doing  A GOOD  WORK  by contributing to the replenishment of 
my wine-cellar. 
I am  working like  a horse  at the  moment,  as I  must make  use of 
the time when  I am fit for  work,  and the  carbuncles  are  still with 
me, though they only trouble  me  locally  and do not  disturb  the 
brain-pan. 
In between times, since  one  cannot always  be  writing,  I am 
doing some  DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS  . I  have  no  patience  to  read 
dy 
anything else  at all. Any  other kind  of reading always drives  me 
back  to my  writing-desk. 
Special meeting  of the  'INTERNATIONAL'  this evening.  A good  old 
codger, an OLD  OWENIST,  Weston  (CARPENTER),  has put up the 
following  two  propositions that  he is  constantly defending  in The 
Bee-Hive: 
1. that  A GENERAL  RATE  IN THE  RISE  OF THE  RATE  OF WAGES  would be of no 
benefit  to the  workers; 
2. that  the  TRADES-UNIONS  for  that reason,  etc., are  harmful 
If these  two  propositions,  in  which  he  alone  in our  SOCIETY 
believes, were  to be  accepted,  we  should  be in a  terrible mess, both 
in respect of the  TRADES-UNIONS  here and the  INFECTION OF  STRIKES  now 
prevailing  on the  Continent. 
He will  be  supported  in the  matter  by a  native Englishman— 
since non-members  are  also admitted  to  this meeting—who  has 
written  a pamphlet  to the  same effects  I am, of  course, expected

to produce a refutation. I ought therefore really to have worked 
out my réplique for this evening, but I thought it more important 
to get on with writing my book, 3 and so I shall have to rely on 
improvisation. 
I know in advance, of course, what the two main POINTS will be: 
1. that wages determine the value of commodities; 
2. that if the capitalists pay 5s. today instead of 4, tomorrow 
they will sell their commodities for 5s. instead of 4 (being ENABLED 
to do so by the increased demand). 
Trite though that is, and however little it penetrates the topmost 
surface of things, it is, nevertheless, not easy to explain to the 
ignorant all the competing economic questions involved. You  CANT 
COMPRESS A COURSE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY INTO 1 HOUR. BuT WE SHALL DO OUR 
214 BEST.

It is a most strange irony of fate that this Edgar, who never 
exploited anyone other than himself and was always a WORKMAN in 
the strictest sense of the word, went through A WAR OF and WITH 
STARVATION for the slave-owners. Ditto that both brothers-in-law 
have for the moment been ruined by the American war.

DEAR FRED, 
You must excuse my long silence. The whole time I have been 
suffering throughout from bilious nausea (probably on account of 
the heat), had all kinds of other TROUBLES as well, and apart from 
that I have used the time, when fit to write, for official work on 
my book.b You know how, when one is in such a condition, one is 
always resolving to send letters but never manages to. 
Not much new to report. The valiant Nordstern did not appear 
since my last despatch to you, probably for lack of money. I 
received it again today, and it does not mention the interval at all. 
As you will see, the rag is nothing but a dungheap of loutism. In 
their denunciation of B. Becker, these fellows are now declaring 
everyone a 'traitor' who dares to lay a finger on even one syllable 
of the truth as revealed by Lassalle. 216 Meanwhile, Mr B. Becker 
has provisionally ceded his chairmanship to that lout Fritzsche (of 
Leipzig) and set up his residence in Berlin in order to do business 
with Mr Bismarck directly.

A pretty shambles Baron Izzy's whole movement has degener­
ated into! But the fellow obviously had the right instinct for how 
to make himself Saviour of the German louts! Meanwhile, the 
'unfaithful one'a is living in blissful happiness as a boyar lady with 
her Wallachianb in Bucharest. 
I have had no letters from Liebknecht for some while. But that 
is no doubt because for a long time, while my correspondence was 
suspended, I did not answer the notes that used to come in almost 
daily from him, none of them having anything to say, and each 
successive one invariably confirming the nullity of its precursor. 
In respect of the 'INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION', I will just mention 
the following here: 
The Italian gentlemen have come back and indicated to us last 
Tuesdayc that they have yet once again nominated Major Wolff as 
their delegate. Mr Mazzini appears to have convinced himself that 
he may need us, whereas we care not a FARTHING for him. 
A YANKEE by the name of Leon Lewis (in Paris at the moment) 
has become the American secretary. In my opinion, he is 
worthless, although he has plenty of money and even more 
ambition. The fellow imagined that by founding a paper, The 
Commoner, he could revolutionise England in 24 hours or in 6 
months at the very least. He offered this paper-to-be to us as our 
organ, but found that we are setting very business-like and by no 
means enthusiastic conditions, and so he has 'temporarily' left for 
France with his wife, who is also a great politician, I suspect to see 
if he can apply his 'LEVER' there with any more success. 
I should like your advice on the following point: 
I read a PAPER (which would perhaps cover two printed sheets) at 
the CENTRAL COUNCIL about the question raised by Mr Weston d as to 
the effect of  A GENERAL RISE OF  WAGES,  etc.214 The first part of it is a 
reply to Weston's nonsense; the second A THEORETICAL exposition, 
insofar as it was appropriate for the occasion.' 
Now they want to have it printed. On the one hand, that could 
perhaps be useful to me, since they are in contact with J. St. Mill, 
Professor Beesly, Harrison, etc. On the other hand, I have my 
doubts: 
1. to have 'Mr Weston' as adversary is not exactly vairy-
flettering'; 
2. the second part of the paper contains, in an extraordinarily 
condensed BUT RELATIVELY POPULAR FORM, many new ideas which are

anticipated from my book,3 whilst at the same time it does, of 
necessity, have to skate over a lot of problems. The question is, whe­
ther it is advisable to anticipate things of that kind in such a way? 
I think you can decide on this better than I can because you can 
look at the matter with more detachment from a distance. 
I also had a lot of trouble TO  PUT  OFF the  CONGRESS  announced for 
this year, in the face of pressure from Schily, J. Ph. Becker, and 
some of the Paris COMMITTEE. I did, however, succeed—and that was 
decisive—in persuading the COUNCIL here that in view of the 
electoral agitation, etc., there should only be a preliminary 
(private) conference in London this year, to which the CENTRAL 
FOREIGN COMMITTEES would each send one delegate (not the AFFILIATED 
SOCIETIES BUT THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEES). I am certain that the 
Brussels Congress would come to nought. The time was not yet 
ripe for it. 217 
Our Eccarius has become one of the main London electoral 
agitators and would have accepted the invitation to agitate in the 
country (on £2 per week), if this were not the height of the 
tailoring SEASON. He has a peculiarly dry, humorous manner of 
speaking which particularly appeals to the English. 
Edgarb is already much recovered. An odd fish for whom 
fodder and fancy clothes really are the only things of account; as 
egotistical as a dog or a cat,  BUT  A KIND-NATURED  ONE.  His brain has also 
begun to display certain activity. 
Johnson's policy likes me not. A ludicrous AFFECTATION of severity 
towards individuals; hitherto excessively VACILLATING and weak when 
it comes down to it. The reaction has already set in in America 
and will soon be much fortified if the present lackadaisical attitude 
is not ended immediately. 
What do you say to the debates in the Prussian Chamber? At 
any rate, the revelations about the judicial system, etc., following 
in rapid succession were splendid. Ditto the obvious blow which 
the National Association Great-Prussia men152 received, as was 
shown particularly in the Polish debates. 
Ad vocemc  Poland,  I was most interested to read the work by 
Elias Regnault (the same who wrote the 'histoire des principautés 
danubiennes'), 'La Question Européenne, faussement nommée La 
Question Polonaise'. I see from it that Lapinski's dogma that the 
Great Russians are not Slavs has been advocated on linguistic, 
historical and ethnographical grounds in all seriousness by 
Monsieur Duchiriski (from Kiev, Professor in Paris); he maintains 
a Capital - b Edgar von Westphalen - c Regarding

that the real Muscovites, i.e., inhabitants of the former  GRAND 
DUCHY OF  Moscow, were for the most part Mongols or Finns, etc., as 
was the case in the parts of Russia situated further east and in its 
south-eastern parts. I see from it at all events that the affair has 
seriously worried the St Petersburg cabinet (since it would put an 
end to Panslavism in no uncertain manner). All Russian scholars 
were called on to give responses and refutations, and these in the 
event turned out to be terribly weak. The purity of the Great Russian 
dialect and its connection with Church Slavonic appear to lend more 
support to the Polish than to the Muscovite view in this debate. 
During the last Polish insurrection24 Duchinski was awarded a prize 
by the National Government for his 'discoveries'. It has ditto been 
shown geologically and hydrographically that a great 'Asiatic' 
difference occurs east of the Dnieper, compared with what lies to the 
west of it, and that (as Murchisona  has already maintained) the Urals 
by no means constitute a dividing line. Result as obtained by 
Duchinski: Russia is a name usurped by the Muscovites. They are not 
Slavs;  they do not belong to the Indo-Germanic  RACE  at all, they are 
des intrus* who must be chased back across the Dnieper, etc. 
Panslavism in the Russian sense is a cabinet invention, etc. 
I wish that Duchinski were right and  AT ALL EVENTS  that this view 
would prevail among the Slavs. On the other hand, he states that 
some of the peoples in Turkey, such as Bulgars, e.g., who had 
previously been regarded as Slavs, are non-Slav.

[London,]  24 June  1865 
Dear Liebknecht, 
You must explain  to  yourself  my  long silence  by  continuing 
indisposition  and  much work  in  intervals when  I have been 
capable  of it.  Your letters, moreover, contained nothing which 
would have required urgent reply. 
The Nordstern  has most likely been suspended  for a  while owing 
to lack  of money?  At  least,  it has not  arrived here  for a  couple  of 
weeks.  A fine gutter  rag, to be  sure!  The  declaration  by  various 
associations" that anyone  who so  much  as  lays  a finger  on the 
articles  of faith  as revealed  by  Lassalle  is guilty  of high treason,  is 
priceless. Haut-goût, 1' INDEED! 
What  is Mr B.  Becker doing  in  Berlin,  and how is the 
Social-Demokrat 'surviving'? 
You have quite  the  wrong notion  of Dr Kugelmann.  I have been 
in correspondence with  him for  years past.  He was a  socialist back 
in 1848, in  Düsseldorf.  As TO Pieper, the VERY NAME  OF Kugelmann 
was not  known  to him  when  he was  here. 218 
I have  not yet  written  to  Stumpf because  I have  not  been 
writing  any  letters over this period.  As  regards  the  letter  he 
entrusted  to Bruhn,  I have  not, of  course, ever  set  eyes upon it. 219 
The  INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION  is making great strides despite the 
'ENORMOUS SUPPORT'  it is receiving from Germany. 220 
As regards  the  'Louis Bonaparte', 0 I could  see  from your  DROPPING 
OF THE  SUBJECT  that the matter has come to nothing. 79 I am  RATHER 
glad of  this,  as I  shall later  be  having  it re-printed  in the 
essay-collection  all the  same.

Dear Miss Lilliput! 
You must excuse the 'belated' character of my answer. I belong 
to that sort of people who always look twice at things before they 
decide one way or the other. Thus I was rather startled on 
receiving an invitation on the part of a female minx, quite 
unknown to me. However, having ascertained your respectability, 
and the high tone of your transactions with your tradespeople, I 
shall feel happy to seize this rather strange opportunity of getting 
at your eatables and drinkables. But, pray, don't neglect the latter, 
as spinsters usually have bad taste of doing. Suffering somewhat 
under an attack of rheumatism, I hope you keep your reception 
room clear of anything like draught. As to the ventilation 
required, I shall provide for it  myself.  Being somewhat deaf in the 
right ear, please put a dull fellow, of whom, I dare say, your 
company will not be in want, at my right side. For the left, I hope 
you will reserve your female beauty; I mean the best-looking 
female amongst your guests. 
I am somewhat given to tobacco-chewing, so have the stuff 
ready. Having from former intercourse with Yankees taken to the 
habitude of spitting, I hope spittoons will not be missing. Being 
rather easy in my manners, and disgusted at this hot and close 
English atmosphere, you must prepare for seeing me in a dress

ENGELS TO MARX 29 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 15 July 1865 
Dear Moor, 
Liebknecht has been expelled from Prussia; has he written to 
you since and given you his address? The poor devil will probably 
need money, and a few pounds will be more valuable to him at 
this moment than otherwise. But where should they be sent to? 
MR Johnson's policy is less and less to my liking, too. 
NIGGER "-hatred is coming out more and more violently, and he is 
relinquishing all his power vis-à-vis the old lords in the South. If 
this should continue, all the old secessionist scoundrels will be in 
Congress in Washington in 6 months time. Without COLOURED 
SUFFRAGE nothing can be done, and Johnson is leaving it up to the 
defeated, the ex-slaveowners, to decide on that. It is absurd. 
Nevertheless, one must still reckon on things turning out 
differently from what these barons imagined. After all, the 
majority of them have been completely ruined and will be glad to 
sell land to immigrants and speculators from the North. The latter 
will arrive soon enough and make a good number of changes. I 
think the MEAN WHITES will gradually die out. Nothing more will 
become of this RACE; those who are left after 2 generations will 
merge with the immigrants to make a completely different RACE.

The NIGGERS will probably turn into small SQUATTERS as in Jamaica. 
Thus ultimately the oligarchy will go to pot after all, but the 
process could be accomplished immediately at one fell swoop, 
whereas it is now being drawn out. 
I don't think that you would win many laurels by a disputation 
with  MR Weston, and it would certainly not make a good début in 
English economic literature. 3 Otherwise, I cannot see it would do 
much harm to anticipate a few odd points from your bookb—

In the elections here Jones has been working BODY AND SOUL for 
Heywood, but as a TEETOTALLER and PERMISSIVE BILLS man222  he won't 
pull much with the workers. Moore has been working hard, too. 
The Manchester  SNOBS  will be gladdened by James, the fellow wants 
to become a  JUDGE  and nothing more. The election is costing him 
a pretty penny, just for the champagne his committee and cronies 
have swigged. TALK ABOUT BRIBERY, CORRUFHON  AND  TREATING, fellows like 
that fat Knowles came in droves to the Queen's Hotel, where the 
headquarters was, gorged their fill and swigged rivers of 
champagne, and everything was settled with a slip of paper on 
which a committee-member wrote: valid for 2 LUNCHEONS and 3 
BOTTLES  CHAMPAIGN.  In Lancaster, the 3 candidates together disbursed 
£20,000, and there was free booze for a whole week in every pub. 
I was here in the Queen's Hotel at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the 
elegant SMOKING  ROOM  looked like the old den in Windmill Street, 223 
and customers were served by CELLAR  BOYS  in white shirt-sleeves and 
aprons, instead of BARMAIDS in satin dresses. The whole company 
was drunk, and at half past six the landlord had to have the hotel 
cleared by a police patrol. My task consisted in getting James' 
committee people to tipple until they were incapable of doing 
their job, and in several cases I was successful beyond expecta­
tion. 
I've had a very hard time at the office, Charlesc was away, Franz 
Ermen ditto, and a colossal amount of work to boot. Things are 
better now. I am now on Grimm's Fairy Tales, German heroic 
epic,  ancient Frisian law, etc. As soon as I have got through that 
somewhat, I'll have a serious go at Old Norse. The poetry in it is a 
tough nut because of its deliberate obscurity and all the many 
names in the mythology, and I can see it's  NO USE doing this just as

Dear Moor, 
How do you  like our  Prussian Mirabeaus in—the Zoological 
Gardens} Harkort  and  Co. as wild animals, Bismarck himself could 
not have thought that up.224 
By the by, it  seems certain  to me  that Mr  Bismarck decidedly 
wants  to have  a collision. For  me the  most convincing evidence  of 
this is the  behaviour  of Schweitzer's shit-rag,a which  is being 
confiscated every  day now. The  workers  are now  suddenly 
expected  to take the part  of the Deputies, after being called  on for 
6 months  not to get  excited; there  are to be  mass meetings, etc., 
and every effort  is to be  put into agitating against the government. 
Further corroboration  is provided  by the unanimous refrain from 
the reactionary press, which  is comparing  the  banquet with  the 
February banquets  in Paris,225  and  finally  the  government's whole 
proceeding,  the  pointless provocations, etc. Meanwhile,  it was to be 
expected that Bismarck would come  a cropper. Wasn't cleverly 
enough organised anyway.

On the other hand, Schweitzer-Becker seem to want to take the 
opportunity to make a decent EXIT. The Social-Demokrat and the 
Association3 are to be suppressed so that those gentlemen can be 
whitewashed. I've stopped reading that rag as of 1st inst., 
incidentally. Bismarck seems to have had his fill of paying for it, 
and so have I. So, if anything should happen, I shall have to rely 
on you for information.

[Draft] 
[London,] 25 July 1865 
Dear Citizen, 
Some considerable time ago I sent a letter to you by an 
Englishman, who was to visit Germany and travel through 
Brussels. Since then I have had no news, either from you or from 
my Englishman. I shall not refer back to my reply to your letter, 
but will deal solely with current matters. 
Mr Le Lubez has rejoined the Central Council as delegate from 
an English branch, b and the Italian society in London20 has 
reinstated Mr Wolff as its representative on the Council/ 
Mr Charles Limousin, one of our correspondents in Paris and 
editor of the Tribune ouvrière..., following the seizure of the 
Tribune ouvrière, and being unable to find another printer in Paris, 
went to Brussels in an attempt to bring out the paper there. Whilst 
a General Association of German Workers

there, he investigated the state of our affairs. He was told that, 
after it had unanimously approved your proposal that it should 
amalgamate with our Association, the Société Federative had 
withdrawn: 
1. because it insisted on the right to choose its own correspon­
dents and not have them imposed on it by the Central Council; 
2. because it refused to pay for the membership cards, although 
it remitted If. 50 just as before. 
According to Mr Limousin's letter, you had then approached the 
Société typographique, but with the same result owing to the same 
difficulties. 
With regard to the election of correspondents, the Central-
Council has acknowledged the right of affiliated societies to choose 
their own representatives. It has only retained the power to 
confirm them. Things were different in Brussels because no 
society had yet been constituted there. Would it not be possible to 
reach a compromise, whereby the societies would accept you as 
their correspondent, but they would, for their part, choose an 
administrative committee, as was done in Paris and Geneva? 
With regard to the dues, the societies will readily realise that the 
Central Council would be prevented from any general action if all 
the affiliated societies claimed the right not to pay dues. It appears 
that the objection is to paying dues twice. Would it not be possible 
to find an amicable solution to these matters? The Central Council 
will make any concession compatible with its responsibilities. 
For my part, I am convinced that your actions were dictated 
solely by your zeal for the common cause, and I am appealing to 
this same zeal in asking you to work for reconciliation and 
restoration of relations. You would oblige me greatly by replying 
immediately, firstly because I have to give the Central Council a 
report on this affair, and secondly because a preliminary conference 
of members of the various administrative committees will be taking 
place in London on 25 September.217 
The Central Council is persuaded that the congress cannot take 
place this year, but the preliminary conference in London will 
make preparations for it.a 
With fraternal greetings

MARX TO ENGELS 101 
IN MANCHESTER3 
[London,] 31 July 1865 
Dear Engels, 
As you may have suspected, the reasons for my prolonged 
silence are not the most pleasant. 
For two months I have been living solely on the pawnshop, 
which means that a queue of creditors has been hammering on my 
door, becoming more and more unendurable every day. This FACT 
won't come as any surprise to you when you consider: 1. that I 
have been unable to earn a FARTHING the whole time and 2. that 
merely paying off the debts and furnishing the house cost me 
something like £500. I have kept accounts  (AS  TO THIS  ITEM)  PENCE  for 
PENCE, as I myself found it unbelievable how the money disap­
peared. To top that, I have been sent every conceivable, 
antediluvian IOU from Germany where God knows what rumours 
had been circulated. 
To begin with, I wanted to come up to you to discuss the matter 
with you in person. But, at the present moment, any time lost 
cannot be made up as it is not good to interrupt my work. Last 
Saturday I told the Sub-Committee of the 'INTERNATIONAL'21 that I 
was going away, so as at least to have a fortnight for once 
completely free of disturbance for PUSHING ON with my work. 
I assure you that I would rather have had my thumb cut off 
than write this letter to you. It is truly soul-destroying to be 
dependent for half one's life. The only thought that sustains me in 
all this is that the two of us form a partnership together, in which 
I spend my time on the theoretical and party side of the BUSINESS. It 
is true my house is beyond my means, and we have, moreover, 
lived better this year than was the case before. But it is the only 
way for the children to establish themselves socially with a view to 
securing their future, quite apart from everything they have 
suffered and for which they have at least been compensated for a 
brief while. I believe you yourself will be of the opinion that, even 
from a merely commercial point of view, to run a purely 
proletarian household would not be appropriate in the cir-
a The letter bears the stamp: International Working Men's Association / Central 
Council / London.

cumstances, although that would  be quite  all right,  if my  wife  and 
I were  by ourselves  or if the  girls were boys. 
Now, regarding  my  work,  I will tell  you the  plain truth about  it. 
There  are 3  more chapters  to be  written  to  complete  the 
theoretical part  (the  first 3 books). Then there  is still the 4th  book, 
the historical-literary one,227  to be  written, which will, comparative­
ly speaking,  be the  easiest part  for  me, since  all the  problems have 
been resolved  in the  first 3 books,  so that this last  one is  more  by 
way of repetition  in historical form.  But I  cannot bring myself  to 
send anything  off  until  I have  the  whole thing  in front  of me. 
WHATEVER  SHORTCOMINGS  THEY  MAY  HAVE,  the advantage of my writings is 
that they  are an  artistic whole,  and  this  can  only  be achieved 
through  my  practice  of never having things printed until  I have 
them  in front  of me in  their entirety. This  is impossible with Jacob 
Grimm's method which  is in  general better with writings that have 
no dialectical structure.228 
The English version will  be dealt with differently  on the  other 
hand.  Fox has no  doubt that  he can  find me a  publisher  as soon  as 
I get the  first sheets  of print back.  I would then arrange with 
Meissner that, in addition  to the  proofs  for  correcting,  he would 
also send  me the  clean proof  of each sheet,  so that the  German 
could  be corrected  at the  same time  as it is  being translated into 
English. Regarding  the  latter,  I shall  of course need your 
assistance.  I am  expecting  my  real earnings from this work  to 
come from  the  English edition. 229 
As far as the  'INTERNATIONAL'  is concerned,  the  position  is as 
follows: 
I made over  the £5 to  Cremer  to buy  shares  in The  Bee-Hive. 
But since Cremer, Odger,  etc.,  were going  up to  Manchester  at 
that time, nothing came  of it, and  Potter HAD THE BETTER OF IT.205 
They decided  to postpone  the  matter until  the  next meeting  of 
shareholders (actually,  the  annual  one). But I  don't think that 
anything will come  of it.  Firstly, because  the  squabble between 
Odger  and  Potter  has  become  a public scandal. Secondly, because 
The Miner  and  Workman's Advocate  has  offered  its columns  to us. 230 
(Apropos.  At a  recent meeting with  the  Miner  we  undertook  to let 
it have contributions gratis.  So, if you  have time  to write  a little 
article  on  FOREIGN POLITICS (Prussian, etc.),  now and  then, send  it to 
me to be  passed  on to the  paper.) 
According  to our  Rules  a public congress ought  to be  held  in 
Brussels this year.  The  Parisians, Swiss  and  some  of the  people 
here,  too, are  going  for it  hammer  and  tongs.  In the  present 
circumstances—especially since  I have  so little time  to write  the 

=====第212页=====
174 92. Marx  to Engels.  5 August  1865 
necessary documents for the  CENTRAL COUNCIL  as well—I can only 
foresee  a disgrace. Despite considerable opposition from  the  other 
side,  I have succeeded  in turning  the  public congress  in Brussels 
into A  PRIVATE PRÉALABLE CONFERENCE  in London (25 September) which 
only  DELEGATES  OK THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEES  will attend and at which 
the future congress  is to be  prepared. Official reasons given  for 
postponing  the  congress were: 
1. The need for  PRÉALABLE UNDERSTANDING  between the  EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEES. 
2. The  obstacles  to the  Association's propaganda arising from 
the STRIKES  IN FRANCE,  the elections,  REFORM MOVEMENT  and  WORKWOMEN'S 
E2S1 NGLAND. 
3. The  ALIEN BILL REI.ENTLY PRESSED  in Belgium232 which rules out 
Brussels as a  RENDEZVOUS  for an  INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMENS CONGRESS.21 
I do not see the  Social-Demokrat  any  more,  as the  Workers' 
Society3  has  also stopped it.200  Nor am I  taking  the  Nordstern  any 
more,  but I do see it  occasionally  at the  Society.  It said  the 
Rhineland branches  had on the  main question deserted Bernhard. b 
Edgarc  is a  very expensive guest  for  us, especially  in the  present 
circumstances,  and he  does  not  seem  in the  least inclined  TO DECAMP. 
In consequence  of the hot  weather  and  related biliousness,  I 
have again been vomitting nearly every  day for the  past  3 months, 
as I did  previously  in Brussels. 
Salut. Your 
K. M.

POINT IN QIESTION is whether to do a fair copy of part of the 
manuscript and send it to the publisher, 3 or finish writing the 
whole thing first? I have decided in favour of the latter for many 
reasons. No time is lost by it,  AS FAR as the work itself is concerned, 
although some time is lost in printing; however, on the other 
hand, once begun, that cannot then be interrupted in any way 
either. Furthermore, in view of the level of the thermometer, 
progress with it has been as fast as anyone could have managed, 
even having no artistic considerations at all. BESIDES, as I have a 
MAXIMUM LIMIT of 60 printed sheets, it is absolutely essential for me 
to have the whole thing in front of me, to know how much has to 
be condensed and crossed out, so that the individual sections shall 
be evenly balanced and in proportion within the prescribed 
limits. 233 In any case, you can be sure that I shall spare no effort to 
complete as soon as possible, as the thing is a nightmarish burden to 
me. Not only does it prevent me from doing anything else, but it 
is also DAMNEDLY irksome to have the public kept entertained with 
the expectation of laurels to come (not by me, to be sure, but by 
Liebknecht and others). And furthermore, I know that time will 
not stand still for ever just as it is now. 
Eichhoff has written a few lines to me, but couldn't call on me 
owing to pressure of business. In his letter he said Dronke would 
visit (he was here yesterday) but in such a confused way there was 
no making sense of the scriptum. b That 'treatise' is sticking to POOR 
Eichhoff like his own skin, and no operation will detach it from 
him. 
What do you make of Siebel's productions as a patriotic-liberal 
poet? The thing appears to have been written during extremely 
depressing hangover. It is utter nonsense and surpasses EVERYTHING 
our friend has previously produced. 
The Social-Demokrat' s attempt to commit itself in support of the 
bourgeoisie is a sign of complete and utter fiasco, although I share 
your view that the first calls in Berlin did not occur without some 
ministerial prompting. c However, the other Lassallean faction, 
which executed a volte faced  against the Social-Demokrat as a result 
of our statement,* are also quite a pitiful rabble. These fellows are 
not merely at loggerheads with B. Becker and Co. as to whose 
faith in Lassalle is the true one, but several of their branches have 
published that phrase inspired by OLD Hatzfeldt and coined 
specifically with us in mind, that anyone who tried to overturn or

change even one syllable of the truths as revealed by Lassalle, was 
declared a traitor to the 'people'. 216 
It is ages since I last answered Liebknecht, despite various notes 
he sent me; however I am going to do so now. He is in Hanover 
for the time being now, but his wife 3 is still in Berlin. The reason 
why I did not write was partly that I was very busy, and also I had 
enough on my hands with my own TROUBLES. On the other hand, I 
was furious with him for the nonsense which he had been retailing 
about me at the Berlin Lassalle-Association and which is there for 
all to read in the scrap of a pamphlet about B. Becker's expulsion 
from that association which the old sow got someone called 
Schilling to publish (Farthing would have been a more appropriate 
name). 234 With his usual talent for being too lazy to acquaint 
himself with the facts, he drivels the greatest nonsense abour the 
Bangya-manuscript169 and my intercession for Becker  quoadh 
Vienna Botschafter^ etc. And, moreover, the whole way in which 
he plays the part of my 'PATRON' and 'apologises' for me to the louts 
of Berlin for them not knowing my works; and generally behaves 
as though so far I had done nothing in affairs of action. So, I 
allowed some time to elapse, so as not to say anything rude to him 
and to pacify myself with the thought that Liebknecht will be 
Liebknecht and that his intentions are 'good'. The 30,000 
members of the old Berlin Journeymen's Association, and ditto the 
Association of Printers there organised a kind of ovation for him 
when he was expelled. With his usual optimism, Wilhelmchen sees 
'the proletariat of Berlin at my (that is, his) and our (yours and 
mine) feet'. 235 At the same time, he has not managed even to form 
a single BRANCH of 6 members for the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION in 
Germany, although the sanguine fellow must surely realise that I 
cannot serve up his DELUSIONS to the English as true coin. He also 
kept on writing to me about my 'book'. But however often I sent 
him 'books' (first the whole remainder of ' Vogt,,c then the whole 
remainder of the 'Communist Trials'*) at his most sanguine 
request, from the moment he received them, I never heard a 
dying word more about them. 
Mr Groote, Party of Progress " deputy for Düsseldorf, has written 
to him saying that what he did in Berlin has had more effect than the 
actions of 100 Party of Progress deputies.

Edgar3  has just recently caught a cold which has gone to his 
nose,  which, as a result of this ACCIDENT, looks positively Bardol-

During the warm weather I have been regularly working day 
and night by the open window. Outcome: an attack of rheumatism 
in my right arm, particularly the shoulder blade, which is very 
painful and makes writing, especially any lifting-movement,  dif­
ficult. I instinctively cry out if I unintentionally raise my arm in 
bed at night, which tells you how nasty the thing is. Does Gumpert 
know of any kind of NOSTRUM for it? 
You probably know that at the Gymnastic Festival in Paris, the 
worthy Gottfried Kinkel refused the laurel crown he was offered 
by a Jew who was presiding, with the words: 'I want no crown, not 
even a crown of laurel', but at once added in fairly unvarnished 
words that he had by no means yet given up his claims to the 
Presidency of the German Republic, the 'office' that was his due. 
The Nordstern ridiculed him rather effectively as much for this bit 
of melodrama, and for his whole SPEECH, which was disgusting? The 
Festival opened with a toast to Badinguet. d

Dear Moor, 
I have got a remedy for your rheumatism that Gumpert once 
used to cure me with within 24 hours, and from a much more 
severe attack, too. Get yourself 2 big bags of flannel made, big 
enough to cover the affected part completely and a bit over; have 
these bags filled with BRAN and heated each in turn in the oven, 
just as hot as you can bear it; you put each in turn on the place, 
changing them as often as ever you can. All the while keep 
yourself warm and quiet in bed, and you will soon feel very 
considerable  relief,  but you mustn't discontinue the treatment on 
that account until all the pain has gone (say 24-36 hours). 
Eichhoff has just called; he has got himself made DIRECTOR of a 
LIMITED COMPANY in London; it is crystal clear to me from the whole 
affair that the idea is for him to be duped of a substantial sum 
again, but there's absolutely no helping the fellow, with his mania 
for seeing everything couleur de rose. 3 He has now gone so far as 
believing that the silk-trade here in England absolutely could not 
go on without him. 
I'm so pleased the bookb is making rapid progress, for I had 
really begun to suspect from one or two phrases in your last letter 
that you had again reached an unexpected turning-point which 
might prolong everything indefinitely. The day that manuscript is 
sent off, I shall drink myself to kingdom come, that is, unless you 
come up here the next day so that we can seal it together. 
Many thanks for the Free Presses. 
Our worthy Liebknecht simply cannot help putting his foot in it, 
or writing off to people just whenever the mood takes him. We 
shall always be annoyed with him for 10 months out of 12, as soon 
as he is by himself and has to act on his own initiative. In the 
meantime que veux-tu? 1" Liebknecht does as Liebknecht is, and all 
the exasperation and all the grumbling will not help matters. And 
after all, when all's said and done, at the moment he is the only 
reliable link we have in Germany.

A woRKiNGMEN's  CONGRESS  in Brussels would certainly be the greatest 
stupidity in present circumstances.217 Just remember our own 
experiences in that little country.236 That sort of thing can only be 
done in England, the FRENCHMEN ought to know that. It would just 
be throwing away money and time and trouble to attempt 
anything of that kind in Belgium. 
Have you got Schilling's pamphlet on B. Becker?" You might let 
me have it for a couple of days. 
I don't know whether Strohn is in Hamburg or Bradford, I 
haven't heard anything from him for quite a long time now. 
The Rhineland philistines are supposed to be frightfully angry 
with Bismarck; it is splendid that those jackasses are having their 
'historical development on a legal basis' so nicely demonstrated. 
Have you seen Bismarck's latest dodge to raise money? The 
Cologne-Minden Railway had granted the state the right to buy up 
its shares at par in return for an interest-guarantee from the state 
(100-taler shares are now standing at over 200 talers); he has 
bartered away this right to the Railway for 13 million talers, and 
the Kölner Zeitung calculates that in this way he got hold of 30 
million talers, including sale of the shares already owned by the 
state,  etc. The question is, will the Cologne-Minden Railway pay 
up without the Chamber's approval for the deal. If it does so, 
Bismarck will again have a clear road for years ahead, and the 
philistines will have been atrociously shitted upon. We shall soon 
see. 237

DEAR FRED, 
Letter from Mr Siebold enclosed. 239 You need not send it back. 
Secondly, I am sending you the Hatzfeldt rubbish.3  Do not send it 
back, but store it. Don't show it to anyone either. Fortunately, this 
rubbish has left no trace in the German press. The only thing 
relating to it which appeared publicly in the press was a statement 
by Metzner (ex-authorised representative of the Berlin branch b) 
and Vogtc  (STILL its treasurer), countersigned W. Liebknecht, in 
which they stated: 
1. that Schilling had falsified the report, suppressed some 
resolutions and made others their direct opposite; 
2. that that old girl Hatzfeldt could have spared her comments 
SINCE  the Association had forbidden her to interfere in any way. 
That appeared in Reform0 and Volks-ZeitungP4 
I have been medicating myself for a couple of days now and am 
feeling utterly rotten, quite incapable of working. But Allen tells 
me that I shall be up and about again in a few days. It's the bilious 
trouble and a consequence of the 'bitter' labour of thinking in the 
HOT  WEATHER. Officially I'm now away from home on account of the 
' INTERNATIONAL' . 
Edgare is vegetating. In his hermit-like existence he has become 
accustomed to the narrowest kind of egotism, pondering the needs 
of his stomach from morn till night. But as he is a good-natured 
sort, his egotism is that of a KIND-NATUREDCAT or a friendly dog. To 
the devil with hermit-life. He has even lost all interest in women, 
and his sex-urge has gone to his belly, too. At the same time, he is 
constantly anxious about his precious health, that same lad who 
was, on the other hand, used to feeling 'safe' amongst snakes, 
tigers,  wolves, and leopards. 
He now wishes he was back in Texas again. But there is no 
escape from the confrontation with his cher frère.'

You can  tell what  his  back-to-nature thinking  is like from  the 
fact that  his  present ideal  is to set up a  STORE—a  cigar  or wine 
STORE—obviously  secretly hoping that this will  be the  surest  way to 
apply oneself  to the  cigars  and  wine. 
He likes  to pretend  to be an  OLD GENTLEMAN  who has  settled  his 
accounts with life,  has  nothing more  to do and is  only living  'for 
his health's sake'. 
Besides,  he is  preoccupied with  his  attire  as  well,  and the  'OLD 
GENTLEMEN'  in Rotten Row240 make  him  very  sad  because  he cannot 
keep  up  with them. Queer cove! Laura,  who  HAS  a small  CARBUNCLE 
on her  left cheek  JUST  NOW,  SAYS THAT  HER  MOTHERS BROTHER  IS AN 
EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT FELLAH  ! ' TuSSy  a 'THAT SHE LIKES HIM, BECAUSE HE IS SO FUNNY' 
and little Jenny that Lina Schöler  and he can  congratulate each 
other  'TO  HAVE SAFELY GOT RID OF EACH OTHER'. WELL, THEY ARE  A BAD LOT.  The 
girls have also  SEVERELY CROSS-EXAMINED  me  AS TO THE 'MRS  Burns'.

forgetfulness, that is, unless the whole report is a fabrication. The 
devil take such an advocatus. 
Ditto our sparkling-wine enthusiast Siebold. With what  self-
assured naivety the fellow tried to 'reconcile' you to Blind! 239  And 
then those interesting 'old Swedes' whom nobody has ever heard 
of and whom we're supposed to write to, to make 'contact'. Quite à 
la Harro Harring. I'm increasingly coming round to think that 
from the most southerly latitude of North Friesland onwards 
everything beyond urban bourgeois and peasant politics is pure 
Harro Harring." But no doubt you will be having that dolt on your 
back every year. 
Next week (about Friday 25th inst.) Moore and I are going to 
Germany and Switzerland for a fortnight, and maybe we shall also 
'cast a casual glance' over Italy.241 If I can so arrange it, I shall call 
in briefly at Modena Villas6 on my way back. 
The 28th of this month, i.e. Monday week, is the date of the 
General Meeting of the Cologne-Minden shareholders, which will 
decide Prussia's politics for the next few years. I can't imagine that 
those fellows will be such jackasses as to pay out 13 mill, talers in 
cash to Bismarck without having the approval of the Chambers. 237 
But your liberal Rhineland burgher is capable of a good many 
tricks the moment he has a chance of swindling the state, and 
thinks that in his capacity as Deputy he can obtain indemnity for 
himself afterwards. But if the deal were to fall through, or if it 
were made conditional on authorisation by the Chambers, that 
would be more or less the end for Monsieur Bismarck; even that 
adventurer would not survive such a defeat in financialibus" and 
after such a desperate attempt. But the fact that he is momentarily 
coming to terms with Austria again, shows that intellectually and 
morally he is au bout de son latin. à He knows only too well that he 
can't start a war without being brought down immediately, so he 
goes on lashing out with big talk, chalking up little gains and 
turning Germany into the laughing stock of the world. But the 
philistine is almost as much impressed by him as by Boustrapa. 76 
The philistine now no longer requires even ephemeral victories 
from his idols, but only that they can brag. This is how 
Classen-Kappelmann became the idol of Cologne as well, because 
he took to his heels at the crucial moment.224

[London,]  19  August  1865 
DEAR FRED, 
Since  you are  setting  off on  your travels,241  I must tell  you  that  I 
have to pay a  BILL  for £10 to  BUTCHER  on 28 August, and the 
LANDLORD  is also becoming very  TROUBLESOME.  BY THE BY,  the English 
state appears  HARDPRESSED  FOR  MONEY.  At all events, the  TAXGATHERERS 
were more pressing this  MONTH  than ever before  and  have 
unexpectedly 'relieved'  me. 
I am  still  SICK,  although Allen  is getting  rid of the  LIVER  troubles. 
But now I  have caught  a kind  of INFLUENZA,  which,  he says, will last 
5-6 days  and  which really  is the  biggest nuisance  of all,  AS FAR  AS 
MENTAL ACTIVITY IS CONCERNED.  I hope that with that  I shall have settled 
MY DEBT  TO  NATURE. 
Löhrchenb  is not  really very well either.  For the  past year  she 
has been getting much thinner than  she  ought  to be. But she is a 
strange child  and  only today agreed  to go to the Dr with my  wife. 
a Edgar  von  Westphalen  - b Laura Marx

I HOPE IT is NOTHING SERIOUS. Little Jenny and Tussy a are very well. 
(Ditto Edgar's b  STATE  OF HEALTH  much improved.) My wife had bitten 
out the 2 front teeth in the middle of her lower jaw, and yesterday 
had 4 teeth fitted by way of replacement. These are more or less 
the only 'events' that have occurred here. 
Being unwell, I am unable to write much, and then only  BY FITS 
AND  STARTS.  In between, I am just dabbling in irrelevancies, although 
with the INFLUENZA I cannot even read properly. I 'took the 
opportunity' to 'take up' a little astronomy again, amongst other 
things. And one thing I would like to mention that was new to me 
at least, but perhaps you have known about it for some time. You 
know Laplace's theory of the formation of the  CELESTIAL  SYSTEMS  and 
how he explains the rotation of the various BODIES about their own 
axis,  etc. Proceeding from there, a YANKEE, Kirkwood, has 
discovered a kind of law concerning the differences in the rotation 
of the planets, which had previously appeared quite abnormal. 
The law is as follows: 
* 'The square of the number of times that each planet rotates during one revolution 
in its orbit, is proportioned to the cube of the breadth of a diameter of its sphere of 
attraction.'  * 
This means that between two planets there must be a point at 
which their power of attraction is equally strong; so that a body at 
this point would remain stationary between them. On the other 
hand, the body would fall towards one planet or another on either 
side of that point. This point thus forms the LIMIT of the  SPHERE  OF 
ATTRACTION of the planet. This SPHERE OF ATTRACTION is, in turn, the 
measure of the breadth of the GAZEOUS RINC from which, according 
to Laplace, the planet was formed when it first became separated 
from the  GENERAL  GAZEOUS  MASS.  Kirkwood concluded from this that, if 
Laplace's hypothesis is correct, a specific relationship must exist 
between the VELOCITY OF THE PLANETS ROTATION and the BREADTH OF THE 
RING from which it was formed or its SPHERE  OF ATTRACTION. And he 
has expressed this in the above law, and proved it by analytical 
calculations. 
Old Hegel made some very good jokes about the 'sudden 
reversal' of centripetal to centrifugal force, right at the moment 
when one has attained 'preponderance' over the other; e.g., 
centripetal force is greatest near the sun; therefore, says Hegel, 
centrifugal force is greatest, since it overcomes this maximum of 
centripetal force and vice versa. Moreover, the forces are in

equilibrium when half  way  between  the  apsides.244 Therefore they 
can never depart from this equilibrium,  etc.  Incidentally, taken  as 
a whole, Hegel's polemic amounts  to saying that Newton's 'proofs' 
added nothing  to Kepler,  who  already possessed  the  'concept'  of 
movement, which  I think  is fairly generally accepted now.3 
You know that  the  President  of the  BANK  OF SWITZERLAND  is now Mr 
Karl Vogt,  who  betrayed  his  friend Fazy  as soon  as the  latter left 
Geneva,  and  cheated together with Reinach  (the  real ACTING 
DIRECTOR).  I asked Freiligrath  how Mr  Vogt,  who is  otherwise  of ill 
repute  as a  FINANCIER  in Switzerland,  had  come  by this honourable 
post. Answer:  the  Swiss have hardly  a share left  in the  'BANK OF 
SWITZERLAND'.  The  Jews  in Berlin  and  Frankfurt  a. M.  take  the 
decisions.  And  they support Vogt. Meanwhile, Reinach  has  been 
teasing  our  POOR Freiligrath  so much that  the  latter wrote  him the 
right-thinking rejoinder that even  the  Prussian police never 
persecuted  him  quite  so much. They  say  Fazy swindled  the  bank 
out of IV2  mill.  frs. 
A few  weeks  ago,  Professor Beesly  had an  article about Catiline 
in The  Fortnightly Review, vindicating  the  latter  as a man of 
revolution.b  Much  of it is  uncritical  (as one  would expect from  an 
Englishman,  e.g.  wrong information  on  Caesar's position  at that 
time),  but his  intense rage  at the  oligarchy  and  'respectable people' 
is very nice. Likewise  his  sallies against  the  professional English 
'DULL littérateur'.  Mr Harrison  had an  article  in the  same Review 
expounding  why  'political economy'  can  adduce 'nothing'  in 
refutation  of communism. 0 It seems  to me  that  now  there  is more 
MOVEMENT amongst English thinkers than amongst  the  Germans. 
The latter  are  sufficiently preoccupied with celebrating Classen-
Kappelmann.224

That business of Kirkwood's law was new to me, as it was to

hypothesis?c Surely it ought to be possible to verify a thing like 
that. 
I hope you are all restored to health now. That trouble with

that time, but it really is absurd of you to allow yourself to continue in 
such a way. In such circumstances, you should put your foot down as

DEAR FRED, 
BEST  THANKS FOR THE £20, FIRST HALF of which received. I most 
certainly would not BOTHER you, but the end of the quarter, whose 
bills have been put off, is a very difficult time. 
Regarding Kirkwood's law, there is no doubt that it explains the 
difference in the ROTATORY MOVEMENTS, e.g., between those of Jupiter 
and those of Venus, which hitherto appeared entirely fortuitous.3 
But how he finds out and proves the law  itself,  I do not know, but 
on my next visit to the British Museum I will try to get to the 
bottom of the original work and will tell you more about it then. 
The only 'problem' attached to the matter, as far as I can see, 
consists in mathematically determining the SPHERE OF ATTRACTION of 
each planet. The only hypothetical thing about it is probably the 
assumption of Laplace's theory as a premise. 
My INFLUENZA has invaded my nose to such an extent that the 
TEXAN  Bovsb 'nozzle' has reproduced itself in me, accompanied by 
a frightful cold and a muzziness in the head such as must have 
filled the whole of Laplace's universe of incandescent gas.

received  a SUMMONS TO ATTEND  a meeting  of the  SUBCOMMITTEE today. 
The 4 weeks  of my  disappearance have been totally SPOILT  for me 
by the  DOCTORS  prescriptions. 
Amongst  the  books from Lupus' legacy  I have  in my  possession 
there  is a  copy  of Egli's Neue Handelsgeographie. This Swiss says  in 
the preface that into  the  'biographies  of commercial geography'  he 
has now and  again 
'woven  a view from life,  a view  in contemplation  of which  the  soul  may  lose 
itself  for a  moment,  in comfortable repose  ... genre miniatures woven  in ... a  piece  of 
life shall here unfold before  our  eyes. Life evolves from life alone'. 
The following shows  you  what this naive Swiss means  by 'views 
from life': 
'Markgräfler wine grows  on the  sunny hills  of Mühlheim  and Badenweiler.  It 
was not for  nothing that  our  dearly beloved Hebel sang: 
"At t'Mill  by t'Post 
Tally  ho, mine host! 
Drink  up lads:  a grand wine flows, 
Smooth  as olive  oil it  goes! 
At t'Mill  by t'Post."'a 
To prove 'that  I have  not  taken  the  easy path', this same naive 
Swiss refers  to the  list of works  he has  used. This list numbers 
precisely  20 items, where along with naive 'children's literature'  as 
the Buch der Erfindungen,  etc.,  there  are two  works  by the  self-same

The Swiss have chosen two delegates, Mons Dupleix, a

Old Hatzfeldt dwells at Paris, where the old hag is intriguing 
with the 'horn-bearing' father of 'Socialism', Moses," her most 
cringing slave. It was at her instigation, that he inserted his 
'warning' in the Nordstern and his slander into the Social-
Demokrat. 2iS She is now concocting with him the 'Apotheosis' of her 
own belated 'Oedipus'.b The London correspondent of the 
Social-Demokrat seems to be cracked Weber.c All these things 
have been reported to me from Paris. As to  myself,  I carefully 
abstain from taking any notice whatever of what is going on in the 
Berlin and Hamburg 'organs' of the movement.0 This so-called 
movement is so disgusting a thing that the less you hear of it the

Dear Moor [Manchester,] 4 October 1865 
I always strike unlucky with my plans for coming to London. I 
met my mother" just 3 days before my return here, in Ostende, 
to be exact, and I couldn't make it an hour shorter, of course. Nor 
could I have met her any earlier, as neither of us knew where she 
would be 2-3 days before. But I was  DUE  here on 15 September, 241 
as Charlesb had to leave on that day, as he in fact did. Since then, 
as always when I come back from a journey, the very devil has got 
into the cotton market, I have had to look after Charles' work as 
well as my own, and that is no trifle when cotton goes up in a 
fortnight from 18 to 24 l/2d. per pound, yarns on the other hand 
by 8-9d. per pound, and telegrams of every description pour in. I 
hope that is all over now, and besides Charles will come back at 
the beginning of next week, so that I can gather my wits again at 
last. This horrible rush has made it positively impossible for me to 
write even 2 lines to you, in fact, since I've been back, I've not 
been able to write a line of private correspondence at all. As soon 
as ever I can, I will write at greater length; meanwhile do let me 
know how you all are and how the 'book'c is getting on. I think I 
should manage to come over some time for  3 X  24 hours, as soon as 
we have got things in order here. But our office is looking like a 
pigsty, Gottfried d has taken on 3 fellows for me who are absolutely 
hopeless, and is holding me to the contract which says I am to 
make something of them. So, you can see the way things are here. 
I shall have to sack one or two of them.

Dear FREDERICK, 
I arrived here on Friday" evening. Strohn had pressed me very 
strongly to spend some days with him, but I had too much on my 
mind. I knew things were awry in London and thus wanted to be 
on the spot. 
The DISAPPOINTMENTS MRS Lizzyb  prophesied for me came true 
with a vengeance.  D'abord,"  on arrival at King's Cross, d my case had 
gone, and I still have not got it back even now, which is 
particularly annoying because of the 'papers' it contained, for 
which I am responsible. Then I found my childc was still very 
unwell. Finally, the LANDLORD had been round, had made threats, 
and my wife had only calmed him down with promises of my return.

terminating the LEASE, which the contract admittedly entitles him to 
do. All the other riff-raff appeared in the LANDLORDS wake, some of 
them in person, and some in the form of threatening letters. I 
found my wife so DESOLATE that I had not the  COURAGE  to explain the 
TRUE STATE  OF THINGS to her. And I really do not know what to dol And 
we also have to get coals in, etc. 
As well as these DISAPPOINTMENTS ONE GOOD NEWS. One of the two 
aunts in Frankfurt (the one who is 73,a the otherb  is two years 
younger) has passed on, but ab intestato c (being afraid of dying if 
she should make a will). I shall therefore have to share with the 
other heirs, which would not have been so if there had been a will, 
as she cared nothing for the others. And then another pleasant 
circumstance—we have to wait for the power of attorney from Mr 
Juta from the CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. 
All these pleasant circumstances have rather gone to my 
stomach, so that I at once had myself made up some more of 
Gumpert's medicine.

Dear Moor, 
You should receive herewith at the same time a registered letter 
with £15, which I made out on Friday and gave to our errand-boy 
to attend to. I received no answer from you on Sunday, which I 
found somewhat surprising, and it occurred to me that the boy 
did not give me the ticket for the letter on Saturday morning. 
When I looked into it today, it turned out that the wretch had 
messed up the whole business with his procrastinating and still had 
the letter in his pocket. That was the last straw as far as his 
slovenliness was concerned, and he was sacked. I am extremely 
annoyed about this, as you must meanwhile have been thinking I 
had quietly put your last letter in my pocket and left things to take 
their course, without writing a single word to you.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 17 November 1865 
Dear Moor, 
Your letter was only passed on to me yesterday evening, and I 
shall be making enquiries as to how it was left lying around for so 
long. 
I hope little Jenny is  ALL  RIGHT again and at least has got over the 
acute stage of the illness and the danger therewith. I'm sending 
her a case of port, sherry and claret this evening, to restore her 
strength. It gave me a real fright when I read the word 
diphtheria; it is not something to be made light of. 
The letter from the Berliners really took me aback. 25' It has 
obviously been written by someone with a lot more to him than 
Wilhelmchen a and his references to the latter do not appear to be 
without a certain irony. Now the letter has certainly not been 
written by a worker, the mere fact that Grimm's rules of 
orthography are impeccably observed shows that, and I am just a 
mite suspicious as to how genuine the thing is. At any rate, we 
ought to obtain more information about the 3 signatories, 
Wilhelmchen should know them at least, if the business is bona 
fide. It is rather the form of the document that makes me 
suspicious, the content most definitely implies the contrary. But as 
you won't in any case be going to Berlin to found a new 
organisation there, it will not signify if you write to these people. 
Letter returned encl. 
What do you say to the NiccER-rebellion in Jamaica and the 
atrocities perpetrated by the English?252 The Telegraph says today:

MARX TO ENGELS 253 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 20 November3  1865 
Dear Engels, 
Little Jenny is on the mend again now and thanks you very 
much for the wine. 
Regarding the financial questions, it would be futile to approach 
Dronke about it. To have some peace with the LANDLORD, and that is 
at the root of it all, I have persuaded him to take a bill of 
exchange up till the middle of February for the current quarter, 
for which I owe him -=-. As for the other creditors, I have satisfied 
3 
the most pressing with the £15 and am considering ways and 
means of putting together at least an instalment for the others. 
Your offer is very generous, and as soon as my workb is finished 
and out, the remainder will have to be made up through other 
commitments, or if that should not succeed, although I fully expect it 
will, we shall have to move somewhere cheaper, perhaps to 
Switzerland. 
The Berlin letter is genuine.251  Some days after it arrived, I 
received a letter about it from Liebknecht, who is in continuous 
contact with the Berliners. It also emerges from Liebknecht's letter 
that those curs from the Social-Demokrat would oh so dearly love 
to resume their ties with us. The kind of illusions Liebknecht is for 
ever indulging in can be seen from the following passage: 
*'The people that have applied to you from Berlin, are our friends. If you 
could come, show yourself but once—the gain would be immense. Come if it is 
possible.'* 
Surely Liebknecht ought to know that even if I could go to 
Berlin AT PRESENT, just as a VISITOR, I would have to be completely 
quiet and keep myself to myself and not address workers' clubs! 254 
Liebknecht also writes: 
* 'Professor Eckardt'  * (now the 'principal' radical in the south, as a letter from 
Stumpf in Mainz makes clear) * 'of Mannheim places the Wochenblatt c at our disposal. 
He would be delighted if you and Engels were to write for it a few articles, but not too 
strong.'* 
The Workman's Advocate is as weak as ever. However, it must 
have some appeal as it appeared in a larger format last week. I 
know no more details, as I shall be present at the Association

again  for the  first time tomorrow.  The  Parisians have published  a 
report  on the  conference together with  the  programme  we  drew  up 
for the  next congress.  It appeared  in all the  liberal, quasi-liberal 
and republican papers  in Paris.255  You  will see  what  a friendly 
reception  it had  from  the  following report  by Fox on the  last 
meeting  of our  COUNCIL  which  I am  cutting  out of The  Workman's 
Advocate  for  you.  Our  Parisians  are  somewhat taken aback that  the 
para,  on  Russia  and  Poland which they  did not  wish  to have,  is the 
very one to  create  the  biggest stir.256  I hope that  you  will now use 
some  of  your leisure time  to write  the  occasional article  on one 
subject  or  another  for the  Advocate. 
The Paris publication absolves  me  from  the  trouble  of writing  a 
report  on  France. 
The Jamaican business  is typical  of the  utter turpitude  of the 
'TRUE  ENGLISHMAN'.252  These fellows are as bad as the Russians in 
every respect.  But,  says  the  good  old  Times, these  DAMNED ROGUES 
ENJOYED  'ALL THE  LIBERTIES  OF AN  ANGLO-SAXON  CONSTITUTION'. 3 I.e.  they 
ENJOYED THE LIBERTY,  amongst others,  of having their hides taxed  to 
raise money  for the  PLANTERS  to import  COOLIES  and  thus depress 
their  own  labour market below  the  minimum.  And  these English 
curs with their sensibilities sent  up an  outcry about  'BEAST  Butler' 
for hanging  one  man!  and  refusing  to allow  the  former planters' 
diamond-spangled yellow womenfolk  to  spit  in the  faces  of the 
FEDERAL  SOLDIERS!  The Irish affair257 and the Jamaica  BUTCHERIES  were 
all that  was  needed after  the  American  war ' '  to complete  the 
unmasking  of English hypocrisy! 
Please  do not  forget  to obtain  the  necessary data from Knowles 
for me (and as soon as possible).  AVERAGE  WEEKLY  WAGES,  either for a 
MULE  SPINNER,  or for a female  THROSTLE  spinner; how much yarn (or 
cotton, that  is,  including  the  déchet h that  is lost in spinning)  is spun 
per week  ON  AVERAGE  by an  AVERAGE NUMBER  (or, for that matter, any 
number)  by  each individual;  and  then,  of  course,  an  arbitrary 
(corresponding  to the  labour-wage) price  for the  cotton  and the 
price of yarn.  I cannot write  out the  second chapter c 258 until  I have 
these details.

IN LEIPZIG3 
[London,] 21 November 1865 
My dear Miller,b 
Since the conference246 held at this place I fell again very sick. 
Afterwards I had to leave London for family affairs.249 Hence my 
protracted silence. As to your report, I could not lay it before the 
conference, because I was too personally introduced in it.261 As to 
your Berlin speech, there were some very disagreeable blunders in 
it which could only emanate from  yourself,  because they alluded 
to facts only known to you, but half forgotten and wrongly 
reproduced by you.c But this is a thing of the past. 
I have received the Berlin letter, and I shall answer to it.251 I 
have at present neither the time nor the means to go to Berlin. 
Even if I could, you know very well that all and every sort of 
agitation would be out of the question. The Prussian government 
has not in vain declared that the amnesty, as far as I was 
concerned, still excluded me from Prussia, and only gave me leave 
to travel as a Foreigner through the Bismarckian world.154 
The Workman's Advocate I shall send you one of these days some 
numbers of. You can write to it on every subject you please, social 
or political. Till now it is a paper of good will, but very mediocre 
still. Of course, myself had and have not yet the time to contribute 
to it, although I am one of its Directors.230 (By my continual 
relapse into damned ill health I was forced to interrupt the 
finishing of my bookd  and must now apply to it all my time, part 
of which is, with all that, absorbed by the International Associa­
tion.) Engels has promised to contribute 6 but not yet done so. And 
the same is the case with other people. 
The Conference has resolved that a Public Congress is to take 
place at the end of May, at Geneva. A programme of questions to 
be there debated, has been resolved upon/ But nobody can assist 
who does not belong to a society connected with us, and being sent

or many, we do not care. I shall send you cards which I have 
prepaid, so that you can give them away. But now work! Every 
society (whatever its number) can enbody itself by paying 5 shilling 
in the block. The cards, on the contrary, which cost each 1 shilling, 
give the right of individual membership, which is important for all 
workingmen going to Foreign countries. But treat this money 
matter as quite secondary. The principal thing is to get up 
members, individual or societies, in Germany. On the congress, 
Solingen was the only place represented (they had given power of 
delegation to our old friend Becker, b whom you are very mistaken 
in if you consider him as a tool of Megära Hatzfeldt). 
The programme (of questions to be lead before Congress) I 
shall send you in my next letter. All the Paris liberal and 
republican papers have made great fuss about our Association. 
Henri Martin, the well known historian, had a most enthusiastic 
leader about it in the Siècle] 256 I have heard nothing of 
Quenstedt 262 
A thing which will rather surprise you, is this: Shortly before the 
arrival of workingmen's letter from Berlin, I received from that 
very same place—'centre et foyer des lumières', 0 of course —  a letter 
on the part of— Lothar Bucher, inviting me to become the London 
money article writer of the  Preussische  Staatsanzeiger, and giving me 
to understand that everybody, der noch bei Lebzeiten im Staat 
wirken will, 'sich an die Regierung ralliiren' muss. d I have 
answered him by a few lines which he is not likely to exhibit.263 Of 
course, you must not publish in the papers this affair, but you can 
communicate it, under the seal of discretion, to your friends. 
Freiligrath's London shop—viz. the London branch of the Bank

Dear Moor, 
Enclosed on the new month's account a further two five-pound 
notes,  please to confirm receipt to me at 86 Mornington Street or 
if possible telegraph tomorrow early in the morning to 7 Southgate, 
as I'm not registering the letter this time because of the fuss. 
As far as I can tell from the German newspapers,  Prof.  Eckardt3 
is a South German democrat, one of the Swabians and Bavarians 
who seceded from the National Association.152 It is not clear to me 
how we are supposed to collaborate with him, it's something like 
Kolatschek. 
That the gentlemen from the Social-Demokrat would like to 
resume their ties with us is typical of that  riff-raff.  They think 
everyone is as much of a swine as they are. Bismarck seems to 
have realised how powerless they are and therefore to have 
thrown them out, so at last there's a trial and Schweitzer has been 
a See this volume, p. 198.

sentenced to 1 year of imprisonment.266 B. Becker has now also 
detached himself from Schweitzer and given up his post as 
President of Mankind, so that everything is now falling apart just 
splendidly. So that it was not our intervention, but our non­
intervention that put paid to the whole caboodle. This no doubt 
means that 'Lassalleanism' in its official form will soon come to the 
end of the line. 
Every post brings news of worse atrocities in Jamaica.252 The 
letters from the English officers about their heroic deeds against 
unarmed NIGGERS are beyond words. Here the spirit of the English 
army is at last expressing itself quite uninhibitedly. 'THE SOLDIERS 
ENJOY IT.' Even The Manchester Guardian has had to come out 
against the authorities in Jamaica this time. 
Regarding The Workman's Advocate, I will see what can be done, 
meanwhile perhaps you could send the paper to me. You have no 
notion at all of the TROUBLE and chasing around involved here in 
obtaining these PENNY  WEEKLY  PAPERS which are not worth the bother

MARX  TO  ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  26  December  1865 
DEAR FRED, 
Please forgive  me for not  thanking  you on  behalf  of the  FAMILY 
for the  CHRISTMAS  present until today,  and  indeed  for not  writing  at 
all for so long. I have been so very  BOTHERED ALL THAT TIME OVER  and 
have wasted  so much time dashing this  way and  that, transactions 
right and left  to satisfy  A, and  thereby falling into  the  clutches  of 
B, etc.,  that  my  work  has  been chiefly confined  to the  night, 
and the  good intention  to deal with correspondence  the  next  day 
comes  to grief every  day. 
With regard to the  INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION  and all that that 
entails,  it has  consequently been weighing down  on me  like  an 
INCUBUS,  and I  would  be glad  to be  able  to get rid of it. But  that  is 
impossible, least  of all at the  present time.  On the one  hand, 
sundry bourgeois—Mr. Hughes,  M.P., at  their head—have 
conceived  the  idea  of  turning  The  Workman's Advocate into  a 
proper funded paper, and as one of the  DIRECTORS  I MUST WATCH  THE 
TRANSACTIONS,  to prevent  FOUL PLAY.230  On the other hand, the Reform 
League,  one of the  organisations  we  founded,  has had a  trium­
phant success  at the St  Martin's Hall  MEETING,  the  largest  and  most 
purely working-class  MEETING  that  has  taken place since  I have been 
living  in London.  The  people from  our  COMMITTEE  were  at the  head 
a Lizzy Burns

of it and put forward our ideas.267  If I resigned tomorrow, the 
bourgeois element, which looks at us with displeasure in the wings 
(FOREIGN INFIDELS), would have the upper hand. With the complete 
failure of the workers' movement in Germany, the workers' 
elements in Switzerland have grouped themselves all the more 
around the sections of the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION there. In the 
middle of this month first number of the Journal de l'Association 
Internationale des Travailleurs. Section de la Suisse Romande appeared 
in Geneva, and a German organ 268 will shortly appear under the 
editorship of Becker,3 which has a chance on account of the 
Nordstern's demise and the discrediting of the Social-Demokrat. 
(Old Becker is desperate for articles and has asked me to write 
urgently to you about it, as pro nuncb he has no contributors.) 
Finally, in France the Association is making great progress, in the 
absence of any other centres of movement. So, if I were to resign 
in these circumstances, I should be doing very serious damage to 
the cause; but, on the other hand, since I have so little time just 
now, it is no trifle for me: ABOUT 3 MEETINGS in the West End or the 
City, EVERY  WEEK  first a session of the INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL, then of 
the STANDING COMMITTEE,21 then of the DIRECTORS or SHAREHOLDERS of The 
Workman's Advocate] And in addition all manner of writing to do. 
I have had a few lines from Liebknecht. He is living at 2 
Gerichtsweg, Leipzig, to be addressed as J. Miller, 0 Esq. Things 
seem to be going badly with him as usual, but he seems to have 
some prospect of getting a position as a lexicographer, as well as 
of being granted civic rights in Leipzig, and becoming one of 
Beust's subjects. 
Dr Kugelmann has also written to me. 264 Justus Möser's 
successor, the present mayor of Osnabrück, Mr Miquel, has now 
openly turned renegade; for the moment with bourgeois leanings, 
but 'already' veering in the aristocratic direction. A certain 
Wedekind, formerly consul SOMEWHERE, rolling in money and an 
enthusiastic National-Association member, 152 has rewarded him for 
his merits by making him his son-in-law. Kugelmann has seen 
'gentle Heinrich" 1 in Cologne. He is now cosily installed as editor 
of the Rheinische Zeitung. He complained that I had not visited 
him in Cologne and was treating him as a 'turncoat', etc. He 
claimed always to have 'kept faith with the "cause"' and only to be 
working with the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy now 'to 
promote the evolution and clarification of the class contradictions'

Bonaparte appears  to me  shakier than ever.  The  business with 
the students269  is symptomatic  of ominous signs  of conflict  in the 
army  itself,  but  above  all the  Mexico affair270  and  that original  sin 
of the  LOWER EMPIRE," debts !  Nor has the  fellow managed  to pull  off 
a single coup  in the  past year. Indeed things have reached such  a 
pass with  him  that Bismarck figures  as a  rival  to him! 
Palmerston's death  has  obviously been  a blow here.  If he  were 
still alive, Governor Eyre would have been awarded  the  ordre 
pour le mérite ! 
Freiligrath  is also ending  the  year with tremendous  bad  luck. 
Jew Reinach  has  closed down  the  business here, with  a great 
brouhaha, coming  to London expressly  for the  purpose.b Freili­
grath,  who  owed  the  bank money anyway, suffered  the  further 
misfortune that  3 days before  the  ARRIVAL  of the  mighty Reinach 
one of his  clerks absconded with  £150. But  still the old  boy"  has 
got powerful protection  TO FALL BACK UPON.  His Plonplonist 93 friends 
in Paris  (e.g.  EX-COLONEL Kiss,  who  married  the  daughter  of the 
former French minister Thouvenel,  a millionaire,  and is now at 
the head  of an  enormous company) will find  a new  position  for 
him soon enough. 
Happy  New  Year!  To  MRS  Lizzy,c  too.

from the following example. The whole of differential calculus 
arose originally from the task of drawing tangents through any 
point on any curve. So, that is the example I am going to use for 
you. 
Assume that the line nAo is any curve whose nature (whether 
it's a parabola, ellipse, etc.) is unknown to us and on which a 
tangent is to be drawn at point m. 
Ax is the axis. We drop the perpendicular mP (the ordinate) 
onto the abscissa Ax. Now assume that point n is the infinitely 
closest point on the curve beside TO. If I drop a perpendicular np 
onto the axis, p must be the infinitely closest point to P and np 
the infinitely closest parallel line to mP. Now drop an infinitely 
small perpendicular mR onto np. If you now take the abscissa 
AP...X and the ordinate mP...y, then np  = mP (or Rp), increased by 
an infinitely small increment [nR], or [nR]  = dy  (differential of y) 
and mR (=Pp)=dx. Since the part of the tangent mn is infinitely 
small, it coincides with the corresponding part of the curve  itself.  I 
can therefore regard mnR as a A(triangle), and the AmnR and 
mTP are similar triangles. Therefore: dy (=nR):dx(=mR)  = 
= y(mP):PT (which is the subtangent of the tangent Tn). Thus, the 
dx 
subtangent PT=y  ——•  We now have a general differential equation 
for drawing the tangent at any points on any curves. If I am now 

=====第248页=====
210 118. Marx to Engels. End of 1865-Beginning of 1866 
to operate with this equation and to determine through it the 
length of the subtangent PT (once I have found this, I merely 
need to connect the points T and m by a straight line in order to 
have the tangent), so I need to know the specific character of the 
curve. According to its character (parabola, ellipse, cissoid, etc.), it 
will have a distinct form of general equation for its ordinate and 
abscissa at any point, which one can find in algebraic geometry. 
Thus,  if the curve mAo, e.g., is a parabola, I know that y 2 (;y=the 
ordinate at any given point) =  ax, where a is the parameter of the 
parabola and x is the abscissa corresponding to the ordinate y. 
y^ 
If I put this value for y into the equation PT= , I must 
dy 
then work out dy, i.e. to find the differential of y (which 
represents an infinitely small increment of y). If  yi=ax, I know 
from the differential calculus that from d(y2)=d(ax) (I have to 
differentiate both sides of the equation, of course), it follows that 
2y dy 2ydy=adx (d always means differential). Thus dx = . If I put 
ydx 
this value of dx into the formula PT=—~, I get 
2y2dy 2y2 2ax y 
PT= = = (since y —ax) =  =  2x. Or the subtangent of 
ady a a ° 
any point m on the parabola=twice the abscissa of the same point. 
The differential values are cancelled in the operation.

Dear Moor, 
£10 encl. in 2 Bank-of-England notes. How stands it with bill of 
exchange for LANDLORD? Tell me how much and date when due, so 
that I may make my dispositions. 
That malicious compilation of Social-Demokrat garbage in the 
Schulze-Delitzschite pamphletb  had already been sent me anonym­
ously from Berlin; it is always a good thing to have such a résumé 
with extracts. Schulze-Delitzsch has also announced that in the 
next few days he is to publish a reply to Lassalle, in which he is 
going to demolish him. 72 
You will already know as well that Racowija died of consump­
tion, so presumably Mamsell Dönniges is once more  IN THE  MARKET,  IF 
EVER SHE WAS FAIRLY OUT OF IT. 
Mr Held's speech has also been sent me from Berlin. He's a real 
Berlin scoundrel. 
Monsieur Bonaparte's progress is most decidedly that of the 
crab.  The trouble in the army over Mexico270 is very serious, and 
so is the student trouble in Paris.269  It is very important that the 
Paris students should take the side of the proletariat, confused 
though their ideas on the subject may be. The École polytechnique 
will follow soon enough. It would be so splendid if the rascal lived 
to see his own DOWNFALL, and it now almost appears that he might. 
It is getting more and more rotten for Bismarck every day, too, 
and, if those scoundrels in Cologne had not got him out of the 
soup,  it would probably already have been all up with him now. 237

MARX  TO  ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 5  JANUARY  1866 
DEAR FRED, 
In the  greatest  of haste. 
Best thanks  for the £10. 
The bill  of exchange falls  due on 18  February  and is for  £48.  I 
wanted  the  LANDLORD  to draw  it only  for the 2  terms that were  due 
and not for the  third  one as  well, which  is not due  until  the end of 
January.  But he  insisted. 
A plot has been hatched against the  INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION,  in 
which connection  I need your co-operation. Further details later. 
For the  moment, suffice  to say: Mr Le Lubez  and  Vésinier  (the 
a Engels  is referring  to J.  Bright's speech  on the  Parliamentary Reform delivered  at 
the meeting  in Rochdale  on 3  January 1866,  The  Times, No. 25386,  4 January  1866.

latter well aware that an INQUIRY into his past is in progress; he is in 
Brussels again) have a French branch here273  (INFACT an opposition 
branch); Longuet, the editor of Rive gauche, also belongs to it, and 
it is tied up with all that pack of Proudhonists in Brussels. Vésinier 
began by publishing a long screed against us in the Echo de 
Verniers,  OF COURSE  ANONYMOUSLY. 274 Then, in the same paper which is 
putting out the SLANDERS against our Association (among other 
things, falsely calls Tolain and Fribourg Bonapartists, too), the 
London BRANCH published a programme, a draft of future statutes, 
which they, the Faithful, are going to put to the Congress.275 
The real crux of the controversy is the Polish question. The 
fellows have all attached themselves to the Muscovitist line 
pursued by Proudhon and Herzen. I shall therefore send you the 
earlier articles by the oracles in the Tribune du Peuple against 
Poland and you must do a refutation, either for our papers in 
Geneva (the 'German' one") or for The Workman's Advocate? 16 The 
Russian gentlemen have acquired some bran-new allies in the 
Proudhonised section of 'Jeune France'. b

a 'sophist'.) Apart from having some 1,200 pages of manuscript11

to copy and my publishera grumbling at me for a long time 
now, and apart from the fearful waste of time which the Central 
Committee, the STANDING COMMITTEE21 and the Committee of Di­
rectors of The Workman's Advocate commit me to in this 
Babylon, I have had the most exceptional aggravations and 
difficulties in my 'private circumstances' which obliged me to leave 
London for a while249 and are still unresolved, etc., etc. 
You will see from the enclosed note, which I received today (or 
rather my wife did), that a parcel, which I sent to you  ABOUT  14 
days ago, has been most commendably confiscated by the French 
police. It contained chiefly 'Manifestoes of the Communist Party'.b 
Also a note from me briefly answering your questions and telling 
you that Bender agreed that I should publish your appeal in 
English in The Workman's Advocate, ditto a report on activity in 
Switzerland, etc.277 
The reason why we decided not to publish any official report on 
the conference246 —apart from lack of money and the fact that the 
Rules oblige us to present a general report to the Congress, such 
double emploi" thus to be avoided — was basically that to initiate the 
public in the situation, especially the very 'fragmentary' nature of 
the conference, would do us more harm than good and provide 
our opponents with a useful weapon. We knew that two members 
of the Central Committee, Le Lubez and Vesinier, were just 
waiting to seize this opportunity. Events have confirmed this. 
Firstly, Vésinier's denunciation of the Central Committee and the 
conference in L'Écho de VerviersP 4 Directly following that, in the 
same paper, came Le Lubez' declaration of principles and draft of 
statutes 2 5 that he hoped to impose on the Association in the name 
of the French branch he had founded in London as a 
counterweight to ourselves.273  This plot has meanwhile been 
frustrated. The branch has deserted its founder. Its two best men, 
Longuet (editor of the Rive gauche) and Crespelle, have joined 
the Central Committee. The latter has resolved that Vésinier must 
either substantiate his slanders or be expelled. 
I cannot send you any articles pro nuncd  I have not an hour to 
spare. Engels, however, will do so, as soon as he has seen the first 
number e and knows where and how. Liebknecht will as well, from 
Leipzig. I will ditto write to Dr Kugelmann in Hanover about it. 
Ditto to Stumpf in Mainz.

it.

Liebknecht is living at 2 Gerichtsweg, Leipzig  (address  J. Miller*). 
In one way the movement here has progressed well, but badly in 
another respect. The Reform League we founded has held a mass 
MEETING for universal suffrage, bigger than I ever saw here in 
London.267 All the speakers were working men. The Times itself 
was shocked and published 2 leading articles about the 'ugly' 
incident.1" The obverse side is that this movement is demanding far 
too much of our best working-class forces. 
The Workman's Advocate is weak. It will improve now that 
Eccarius is editor. But there are enormous difficulties in raising 
the money for it. 
I have received a letter from Berlin, signed by Vogt,c  Metzner 
and other workers, in which they give a perceptive and critical 
assessment of the present state of the workers' movement in 
Germany. The only uncritical thing about it is their demand that I 
should come to Berlin and take the matter in hand. Surely they 
must know that the Prussian government has 'forbidden' me to 
settle in Prussia.* 1 
Before I hear from you by what way I can let you have the 
'Manifestoes', I am going to send one experimentally via Mainz. 
You may be able to make use of some things in it for your paper. 
The best thing the German sections can do is for the time being 
to register in Geneva and keep in continuous contact with you. As 
soon as some such arrangement is made, let me know, so that at 
last I can announce at least some progress in Germany here?16 
I am sending this letter under cover to Dupleix, on account of 
the 'French confiscation'. The Empire seems to me to be tottering. 
D'abord,' the business with Mexico and the UNITED STATES. 270 Then 
the mutiny of 3 French regiments.279 Then the student unrest.269 
Bonaparte's losing his head, as manifested in his row with England 
about the renewal of the 'extradition treaty'280  and his banning of 
the lickspittling 'Indépendance belge'. Finally, the trade crisis, which 
will be greatly hastened by the present English, resp. European, 
overimporting to the UNITED STATES.

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 15 January 1866" 
DEAR FRED, 
Laura quite forgot to send you the Tribunes' 3 which I had put 
out ready a week ago. She is today making amends for her 
negligence. Ditto a Workman's Advocate. 
I am enclosing with this letter: 
1. Communication from the publisher in Vienna.0 (You musL 
send this back.)281 
2. Dr Kugelmann. 
3. Meyerd from Berlin. (I have only written back to these pe­
ople today. Time is so very short.)282 
In the meantime, we have crushed the wretched plot hatched by 
Vesinier in BelgiumJ74  and by Le Lubez in London. The editor of 
the Rive gauche and friend of Rogeard, Longuet, also Mr 
Crespelle—the two most intelligent members of the branch 
founded by Le Lubez 273—have joined our Central Committee. His 
branch has declared itself against him, for us. The CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE  HAS SUMMONED  VÉSINIER  'TO SUBSTANTIATE HIS ACCUSATIONS OR TO BE 
EXPELLED'. The fellow reproaches us in the Echo de Verviers among 
other things for: 
'II' (le comité) 'a été chargé d'un des plus grands intérêts de  l'humanité  et il 
abandonne de gaieté de coeur le but sublime pour dégénérer en comité des 
nationalités à la remorque du bonapartisme.'e 
And this degeneration was in fact made manifest in us by our 
statement in favour of Poland, against Russia.283 
'Cédant à des influences fâcheuses'' (the idiot imagines the Polish § of the 
programme originated from the  PARIS DELEGATES,  whereas the latter sought in 
every possible way to get rid of it as 'inopportune'), 'il a inscrit dans le programme 
du Congrès de Genève des questions en dehors du but de  l'association  et contraires

races,  telles que celles: "D'anéantir l'influence russe en Europe etc.", et cela juste 
au moment où les serfs russes et polonais viennent d'être émancipés par la Russie, 
tandis que les nobles et les prêtres polonais ont toujours refusé d'accorder la liberté 
aux leurs. On conviendra au moins que le moment est mal choisi. Avant 
d'approuver ces articles, les membres anglais du comité auraient bien dû se 
demander s'il ne serait pas aussi urgent de mettre un terme aux progrès effrayants 
du paupérisme anglais, de la prostitution des ouvrières, et de la misère des ouvriers 
de la Grande Bretagne, de la famine et du dépeuplement de l'Irlande etc.! Quant 
au membre allemand du comité, qu'il nous dise aussi si l'influence de la politique 
de M. de Bismarck n'aurait pas aussi besoin d'être anéantie en Europe; la Prusse et 
l'Autriche ne sont-elles pas copartageantes de la Pologne et solidaires du crime de 
la Russie contre cette nation malheureuse? Et quant aux prétendus délégués de 
Paris,  sont-ils bien venus de flétrir l'influence russe, alors que les soldats de 
Bonaparte occupent Rome qu'ils ont bombardée, massacrant les défenseurs de la 
république mexicaine après avoir détruit la république française? Que l'on compare 
les fautes et les crimes commis par les gouvernements, et l'on sera convaincu qu'il 
ne faut mettre aucun peuple au ban de l'humanité pour les forfaits de ses 
oppresseurs, que le devoir du comité central était de proclamer la solidarité, la 
fraternité entre tous les peuples, et non d'en mettre un seul d'entre eux au ban de 
l'Europe.'3 
He then appended this lie: 
'Cette faute énorme a déjà eu de fatales conséquences: les Polonais ont 
demandé en masse à faire partie du Comité, et sous peu ils seront en immense 
majorité.'b  (CAPTAIN  Bobczyriski is the only one who is on it — Holtorp doesn't count 
a 'they included in the programme for the Geneva Congress questions not 
concerning the goal of the Association and contrary to law, justice, liberty, 
fraternity and the solidarity of peoples and races, such as: "the elimination of 
Russian influence in Europe etc."; and this they did at the very moment when the 
Russian and Polish serfs had just been emancipated by Russia, whereas the Polish 
nobility and priests have always refused to grant freedom to their own. It will at 
least be agreed that the moment was ill-chosen. Before approving these articles, the 
English members of the committee should have really asked themselves if it was not 
a matter of equal urgency to put an end to the frightening increase in English 
pauperism, in the prostitution of working women and the misery of working men 
in Great Britain, in famine and depopulation in Ireland, etc.! As for the German 
members of the committee, let them also tell us whether the influence of Mr 
Bismarck's policy in Europe does not equally merit elimination; do not Prussia and 
Austria have an equal share in the partitioning of Poland, are they not equally 
responsible for Russia's crime against that unfortunate nation? As for the self-styled 
delegates from Paris, does it come well from them to condemn the influence of Russia, 
when Bonaparte's soldiers are occupying Rome, which they have bombarded, are 
massacring the defenders of the Mexican republic, having already destroyed the 
French republic? If one compares the misdeeds and crimes committed by 
governments, one is persuaded that no people should be put beyond the pale of 
humanity for the infamies of its oppressors, and that it was the duty of the Central 
Committee to proclaim solidarity and fraternity among all peoples, and not  to put one  of 
them alone beyond the pale of Europe.' - b 'This enormous error has already had dire 
consequences: the Poles have asked to join the Committee en masse and before long 
they will represent the overwhelming majority.'

123. Marx to Liebknecht. 15 January 1866 219 
Indisposition, for ever recurring periodically, all manner of 
unfortunate mischances, demands made on me by the INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION, etc., have confiscated every free moment I have for 
writing out the fair copy of my manuscript. 3 I hope to be able to 
take Volume I of it to the publisherb for printing myself in 
March. (The whole thing, the two volumes, will, however, appear 
simultaneously-23S This is good.) 
So, this very much by way of summary. 
Today I am sending you by post the 2 latest issues of The 
Workman's Advocate, of which Eccarius is now editor.0 If, as I hope, 
you send any articles for it, please do so to me (political, social, as 
you will). 
I also enclose  CARDS  OF MEMBERSHIP  for you. I have paid for them. 
You can therefore give them to whomever you like, and have only 
to inscribe the name and after the £, put 0, but after the 0s., Id. 
The conditions, GENERALLY, are these: a society as such that wishes 
to join has an Association collective membership  Card,  for which 5s. 
per year is to be paid. But, if all the members join individually, 
they have to take out cards of the kind I am sending you. This is 
advantageous for workers. The cards serve as a passport abroad, 
and their  confreres'*  in London, Paris, Brussels, Lyons, Geneva, etc., 
will get jobs for them. 
The Association has made great progress. It already has 1 
official English paper, The Workman's Advocate, a Brussels one, La 
Tribune du Peuple, a French one in Geneva, Journal de l'Association 
Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande, and a 
German one in Geneva, Der Vorbote, which will be appearing in a 
few days. Address: 6 rue du Môle,  Genf,  ]. P. Becker, in case you 
want to write to the old man occasionally (as I hope you will). 
I am now hoping you will soon make it possible for me to 
announce the foundation of a Leipzig section and enable me to 
present correspondence. (In English. It can then be used in The 
Workman's Advocate as well.) The number is not important, 
although THE MORE, THE BETTER. 
If people want to join en masse, as a society, you will see that the 
total price of 5s., which they have to pay annually, is nothing. 
J. P. Becker writes to mee: 
'Sections are going to be formed in Leipzig, Gotha, Stuttgart and Nuremberg; 
shall we register them here for the time being, until there is a large number and a 
Central Committee has been formed in Germany?' 278

under the editorship of /. P. Becker. (Address: 6 rue du Môle, 
Genf,  J. P. Becker, in case you wanted to send him an occasional 
article, political or social). 
We have succeeded in attracting into the movement the only 
really big workers' organisation, the English 'TRADE UNIONS, which 
previously concerned themselves exclusively with the wage ques­
tion. With their help, the English society we founded to achieve 
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE3 (half of its Central Committee consists of 
members—working men—of our Central Committee) held a giant 
MEETING a few weeks ago, at which only working men spoke.267 You 
can tell what effect it had from the fact that the LEADERS of two 
successive issues of The Times were concerned with this MEETiNc.b 
As regards my work,c I am now busy 12 hours a day writing out 
the fair copy. I am thinking of taking the manuscript of the first 
volume to Hamburg myself in March and using the opportunity to 
see you. 
I was much amused by the antics of Justus von Möser's 
successor. d How wretched a man of talent must be who seeks and 
finds satisfaction in trivialities of that kind!e 
As regards Bürgers, he is doubtless well-meaning, but weak. It is 
not much over a year ago that he declared at a public MEETING in 
Cologne (it appeared in print in the Cologne papers) that 
Schulze-Delitzsch had 'solved' the social question once and for all 
and that only personal friendship for me had induced him (Bürgers) 
to stray onto the tangled paths of communism! After such public 
statements, could I regard him as other than a 'renegade'?

Dear Friend, 
At the same time as I sent the cards to you, I wrote a detailed

different addresses. The only error I may possibly have committed 
is to have put No. 6 instead of 16 in Vogt's address.288 
I should therefore be grateful if you would enquire at the Post 
Office and inform me of the results. Since I wrote to you,282 a 
fresh carbuncle has developed in a spot that is very painful when I

Dear Fritz, 
It was a close shave this time. My family did not know how 
sérieux the cas e was. If the matter recurs in that form three or four 
times more, I shall be a dead man. I am marvellously wasted away 
and still damned weak, not in the mind but about my loins and in 
my legs. The doctors are quite right to think that excessive work at 
night has been the chief cause of this relapse. But I cannot tell 
these gentlemen the reasons that force this extravagance on 
me—nor would it serve any purpose to do so. At this moment, I 
have all kinds of little progeny about my person, which is painful 
but no longer in the least dangerous. 
What was most loathsome to me was the interruption in my 
work/ which had been going splendidly since JANUARY 1ST, when I 
got over my liver complaint. There was no question of 'sitting', of

lying down, I was able to forge ahead, even if only for short 
periods of the day. I could make no progress with the really 
theoretical part. My brain was not up to that. I therefore 
elaborated the section on the ' Working-Day' from the historical 
point of view, which was not part of my original plan. What I have 
now 'inserted' supplements your book" (sketchily) up to 1865 (and 
I say so in a note289) and fully justifies the discrepancy between 
your estimation of the future and what will actually happen. 
Therefore, as soon as my book appears, it is necessary to have the 
second edition of your book, which will be easy in the cir­
cumstances. I shall provide the necessary theory. Regarding the 
additional historical supplement, which you should give as an 
appendix to your book, all the material, excepting the 'FACTORY 
REPORTS',**  the 'Children's Employment Commission Reports' and the 
'Board of Health Reports',c is utter trash and scientifically unusable. 
Your energy being undiminished by carbuncles, you will easily 
cope with this material within 3 months. 
As far as the Russians are concerned, I have no material. As 
soon as my condition permits, I shall go to the Museumd about it 
and look around for it among the Poles. There's been a great 
crisis with The Workman's Advocate, which will appear tomorrow as 
The Commonwealth, a transformation pushed through by the 
bourgeois element, for which my absence from the COUNCIL was to 
blame. From my sickbed I have, nevertheless, managed to baulk 
the plot by means of written threats, with the effect that Eccarius 
has been made editor instead of a gentleman from The Nonconform­
ist, and an  EDITORIAL  SUPERVISION  COMMITTEE  has been appointed which 
will meet weekly. It consists of  myself,  Fox, Howell, Weston and 
Miall (the PUBLISHER-EDITOR of The Nonconformist and our PUBLISHER 
NOW), 4 atheists against one 'PROTESTANT'. 290 POOR  Eccarius now needs 
your articleL urgently (there being a whole mass of intrigues and I 
unable to help; my book requires all my writing time). 
Your wine is having a miraculous effect on me. While my illness 
was in full bloom I had to buy bad  PORTWINE—it  being the only 
wine suitable for an acute carbuncle condition. 
Apropos. As I see from one of the latest 'FACTORY REPORTS', John

behalf,  to send me a copy.

ENGELS TO MARX" 
IN LONDON' 
Manchester, 10 February 1866 
Dear Moor, 
I have just spoken to Gumpert here and discussed your 
condition with him. He is firmly of the opinion you should try 
arsenic. He has used it in one case of carbuncles and one of very 
virulent furunculosis, and achieved a complete cure in approx. 3 
months. He is now giving it to three ladies, so far with the greatest 
of success; they are positively thriving on it. FOWLERS SOLUTION is 
what he is giving, I believe it is 3 drops 3 times a day (I am not 
quite so sure about that any more), but altogether the patient takes 
about 1 grain of arsenic a day. In view of the specific effect that 
arsenic has with all skin diseases, there is every prospect of it being 
effective with you, too. He thinks iron would only have a 
symptomatic and hence strengthening effect. And with arsenic 
there is no special diet to be observed at all, just living well. 
You really must at last do something sensible now to shake off 
this carbuncle nonsense, even if the bookc is delayed by another 3

months. The thing is really becoming far too serious, and if, as 
you say  yourself,  your brain is not  UP TO THE  MARK  for the theoretical 
part, then do give it a bit of a rest from the more elevated theory. 
Give over working at night for a while and lead a rather more 
regular life. When you are yourself again, come up here for a 
fortnight or so, so that you have a bit of a change, and bring 
enough papers along with you for you to be able to do a spot of 
work here—if you like. Incidentally, the 60 sheets will make 2 
thick volumes.2 Can you not so arrange things that the first 
volume at least is sent for printing first and the second one a few 
months later? This would keep both publisher3  and public happy 
and yet no time will have been lost realiter}' 
You must also bear in mind that as things stand now, the 
situation on the Continent may change rapidly. In Prussia things 
are moving with marvellous rapidity. Bismarck is pressing hard for 
a crisis. First the decision by the Supreme Tribunal,292 and then 
now the threat of an authentic interpretation of the constitution by 
the King.c  The philistines' last illusion about peaceful historical 
development has gone to the devil. The first plausible pretext, 
perhaps no more than a serious complication over Schleswig-
Holstein even, may be the spark that sets it off, once the troops 
are concentrated on the frontier; although I myself hardly believe 
that anything will happen without a more general cause, but the 
possibility is there. What would be gained in these circumstances 
by having perhaps a few chapters at the end of your book 
completed, and not even the first volume can be printed, if events 
take us by surprise? Something may happen any day in France, 
too, in Austria the attempted reconciliation with Hungary can only 
lead to sharper division. 
Q.E.D.: get yourself back on your feet and ad hocd give the 
arsenic a try.

MARX TO ENGELS 101 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 13 February 1866 
DEAR  FRED, 
Tell or write to Gumpert to send me the prescription with 
instructions for use. As I have confidence in him, he owes it to the 
best of 'Political Economy'" if nothing else to ignore professional 
etiquette and treat me from Manchester. 
I was laid up again yesterday with a vicious cur of a carbuncle 
erupting on left loin. If I had enough money, that is, more>—0, 
for my family, and if my book were ready, I would care not a fig 
whether I was thrown on the charnel heap today or tomorrow, 
alias perished. But things being as they are, that cannot be 
contemplated just yet. 
As far as this 'damned' book is concerned, the position now is: it 
was ready at the end of December.227 The treatise on ground rent 
alone, the penultimate chapter, is in its present form almost long 
enough to be a book in  itself.294  I have been going to the 
Museumb  in the day-time and writing at night. I had to plough 
through the new agricultural chemistry in Germany, in particular 
Liebig and Schönbein, which is more important for this matter 
than all the economists put together, as well as the enormous 
amount of material that the French have produced since I last 
dealt with this point. I concluded my theoretical investigation of 
ground rent 2 years ago. And a great deal had been achieved, 
especially in the period since then, fully confirming my theory 
incidentally. And the opening up of Japan 295 (by and large I 
normally never read travel-books if I am not professionally obliged 
to) was also important here. So here was the  'SHIFTING  SYSTEM',  as it 
was applied by those curs of English manufacturers to one and the 
same persons in 1848-50, being applied by me to  myself. 296 
Although ready, the manuscript, which in its present form is 
gigantic, is not fit for publishing for anyone but  myself,  not even 
for you. 
I began the business of copying out and polishing the style on the 
dot of January first, and it all went ahead swimmingly, as I

naturally enjoy licking the infant clean after long birth-pangs. But 
then the carbuncle intervened again, so that I have since been 
unable to make any more progress but only to fill out with more 
facts those sections which were, according to the plan, already 
finished. 
Otherwise, I agree with you and shall get the first volume to 
Meissner as soon as it is ready. 3 But in order to complete it, I must 
at least be able to sit. 
Please do not forget to write to Watts,b as I have now reached 
my chapter on machinery.297 
Could you not dash off an article on Prussia for The 
Commonwealth, under the rubric Berlin? Bear in mind how 
important it is for us to have a firm footing in London. The 
articles on Polandc can take their time. But with the German 
papers, which are at your disposal, it would be fun for you to 
write about Prussia. My influence here depends partly on people 
seeing at last that I do not stand entirely alone. 
I am less bothered by political affairs (not quad individual but on 
account of the book) than by the economic situation, which is 
pointing more and more ominously to a crisis.

MARX TO ENGELS 6 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 20 February 1866 
Dear FRED, 
You can imagine how opportunely the £10 came. I had been 
served with two threats of distraint, for £6 "0" 9d. for the bloody 
municipal  TAXES, and for lsh. 16d. for the QUEENS TAXES. And I had 
until Friday to pay. 
As regards the carbuncles, the position is: 
Concerning the upper one, from my long practical experience I 
was able to tell you that it really needed lancing. Today (Tuesday), 
after receiving your letter, I took a sharp razor, a RELICT OF DEAR 
LUPUS,  and lanced the cur  myself.  (I cannot abide doctors meddling 
with my private parts or in their vicinity. Furthermore, I have 
Allen's testimony THAT I  AM  ONE  OF THE  BEST  SUBJECTS  TO BE OPERATED  UPON.  I 
always recognise what has to be done.) The sang brûle', 1 AS MRS 
LORMIER  SAVS,  spurted, or rather leapt, right up into the air, and I 
now consider this carbuncle buried, although IT STILL WANTS SOME 
NURSING. 
As far as the lower cur is concerned, it is becoming malignant 
and is beyond my control and kept me from sleeping the whole 
night through. If this diabolical business advances, I shall have to 
send for Allen, of course, as, owing to the locus of the cur, I am 
unable  TO  WATCH  AND  CURE  it myself.  And in general it is clear that ON 
THE WHOLE I know more about carbuncular complaints than most 
doctors. 
And by the by, I still hold to the view that I suggested to 
Gumpert during my last STAY in Manchester: that is, that the 
itching and scratching between my testis and posterior over the 
past 2 Va years and the consequent peeling of the skin have been 
more aggravating to my constitution than anything else. The 
business started 6 months before the first monster carbuncle which 
I had on my back, and it has persisted ever since. 
My dear BOY, in all these circumstances one appreciates  MORE  THAN 
EVER the good fortune of a friendship such as exists between

ourselves. You should know for your part that there is no 
relationship I value so highly. 
I will send you 'Zaches' and 'FACTORY REPORTS'* tomorrow. You 
will understand,  MY  DEAR  FELLOW, that in a work such as mine, b there 
are bound to be many SHORTCOMINGS in the detail. But the 
composition, the structure, is a triumph of German scholarship, 
which an individual German may confess to, since it is  IN NO WAY his 
merit but rather belongs to the nation. Which is all the more 
gratifying, as it is otherwise the SILLIEST NATION under the sun! 
The fact, which Liebig had 'denounced' and which prompted 
Schönbein's investigations, was this: 
The upper layers of the soil always contain more ammonia than 
the deeper ones, instead of containing less of it as they would have 
to do if they had lost it through cultivation. The fact was 
recognised by every chemist. Only the cause was unknown. 
Hitherto, decay was considered to be the sole source of 
ammonia. All chemists (including Liebig) denied that the nitrogen 
in the air could serve as a nutrient for plants. 
Schönbein proved (by experiment) that any flame burning in 
the air converts a certain quantity of the nitrogen in the air into 
ammonium nitrate, that every process of decomposition gives rise 
to both nitric acid and ammonia, that the mere evaporation of 
water is the means causing the formation of both plant nutrients. 
Finally, Liebig's 'jubilation' at this discovery: 
'The combustion of a pound of coal or wood restores to the air not merely the 
elements needed to reproduce this pound of wood or, under certain conditions, 
coal, but the process of combustion in itself (note the Hegelian category) 
'transforms a certain quantity of nitrogen in the air into a nutrient indispensable 
for the production of bread and meat.'1 
I FEEL PROUD OF THE GERMANS. IT IS OUR DUTY TO EMANCIPATE THIS 'DEEP' PEOPLE.

Dear Moor, 
Thanks for 'Klein Zaches', 3 etc., which I take as evidence that 
you have received the £10. 
I have just come from Gumpert, whom I did not see until this 
evening on account of my influenza and having missed him 
several times. He considers that you should start the arsenic at once. 
Whatever happens it can do you no harm, but only good. He 
dismisses Allen's comment that it does not agree with you as 
rubbish. He also considers treatment with poultices to be 
nonsense; it only encourages inflammation of the skin, which is 
precisely what needs to be suppressed, while it does not encourage 
suppuration. Ice-packs would be much better, but as long as you 
are in Allen's hands, these could only be applied if he prescribed 
them, of course. But above all, sea air, to restore your strength. A 
spot on the south coast would be preferable, it is true, as in this 
season the weather there is better than up here, but if you would 
rather be near Gumpert, there are places enough on the coast 
here  WITHIN AN HOUR'S RIDE FROM MANCHESTER. 
You can see I have got Gumpert to change his attitude, so that 
he is now pressing you to take arsenic at once, even though Allen 
is still treating you externally, whereas before, for reasons of 
etiquette, he would not hear of it. But do me a favour now and 
take the arsenic, and come up here just as soon as your condition 
permits, so that you do at last get better. With this constant 
procrastination you are just ruining  yourself;  no one can 
withstand such a chronic succession of carbuncles for long, apart 
from the fact that eventually you may get one that becomes so 
acute as to be the end of you. And where will your bookb and 
your family be then? 
You know that I am prepared to do what is in my power, and, 
in this extreme case, more even than I ought to risk in other 
circumstances. But you must be sensible, too, and do me and your 
family the one favour of getting yourself  cured.  What would become

the way you are proceeding, that will be the inevitable outcome. I

over this business, and every day that passes without my hearing

Nota bene. You should never again let things come to such a pass

That is extremely dangerous.

DEAR FRED, 
The thing will soon be all over now. I think that by tomorrow or 
the day after at the latest I shall not merely be able to rise from 
my bed, but to go out, and that with this last malignant cur the 
series of carbuncles is finished, FOR THIS SEASON. I also feel much 
better again GENERALLY. This last attack was atrocious. It did not 
merely put paid to any work, but to any reading, too, EXCEPT 
Walter Scott. 
I found the arsenic not at all unpleasant to begin with (when the 
taste of the CINNAMON predominated). Now I am beginning to find 
its specific flavour most repugnant. Otherwise, I believe it was 
helpful. I took it 3 TIMES  A DAY from the outset.

Dear Moor, 
Gumpert  is décidément*  of the  opinion that, just  as soon  as your 
condition allows,  you  should  go to the  seaside  for at  least  4 weeks 
and in any  case have  a change  of air.  Now what  do you  think  of 
that? Would  you  prefer  to go to a  seaside resort near here 
(Lytham,  or Blackpool  or New Brighton perhaps)  or on the  south 
coast? Make your  MIND  up about  it, and if the  former, then come 
up here.  I shall raise  the  money  for the  purpose  and, as I 
promised  you, a bit  more  as well. These constantly recurring 
carbuncles have really just  got to  stop,  or you will  be unable either 
to work  or to do  anything else.  So, you  must reach  a decision. 
You yourself disrupted  my  contributions  for  The  Commonwealth'1 
by asking  for  something  on  Prussia  as well  as on the  Polish 
business.d  As a  result,  the one was  interrupted  and the  other  not 
completed  in time either.  I was suddenly collared  to CANVASS  for the 
money  for the  Schiller Institute28 which  I told you about,  and  that 
kept me off it  every evening last week,  and I  have  to go out  again

events,  to dispatch  an article  on Poland this week.

London in case anything were to happen. And although the last

Excerpt from a letter to Freiligrath,305 who asked me for 
information on some commercial philistine and, at the same time, 
expressed his regret at your illness and wished you well: 
'Marx needs to rest from working at night and from worry, as 
well as sea-air and good living. That will put him back on his feet 
all right. Such troubles are spared to plump bourgeois like Blind. 
Instead, the poor man has the misfortune that for all the levers 
and thumbscrews he applies, nobody speaks of him other than 
Blind  himself.  Such fellows have their carbuncles on the insides of 
their skulls. But enough of the "DELIBERATE LIAR". 
'How are you actually doing now? I hear the bank in London" 
has closed down. A good thing too, for you, in the long run, the 
liaison with Fazy and Co. could have compromised you later in 
some unforeseen way.212 I am sure you will soon pick up a decent 
position again.'

If I am to go to the seaside at all, it will have to be now, as I do 
not wish to waste any time. I told you in my last letter that in that 
case I wanted to go to Margate, and the requisite steps must be 
attended to now. I also asked you in my little letter what Gumpert 
has in mind by the 'cure'? Continuing with the arsenic, etc., or 
what? 
Everything is at sixes and sevens on the 'INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL' 
and the 'newspaper board',3 and a great desire is being manifested 
to rebel against the absent 'tyrant',b but at the same time to wreck 
the whole shop as well.c My wound (from the last carbuncle) has 
healed up sufficiently (and so far no new one has appeared) for 
me to go out into company next Monday and Tuesday; but, at the 
same time, I can still scarcely endure those late meetings in some 
corner of Fleet Street,,ofi and what is even worse, I am still in a

MARX TO HIS DAUGHTER JENNY 
IN LONDON 
Margate, 16th March, 1866 
5 Lansell's Place 
My dear Child, 
I arrived here yesterday evening, 3/4  past seven. According to 
your instructions I left my luggage behind me in the cloakroom 
and was then landed by the omnibus at a small inn called the 
'King's Arms'. Having ordered a rump steak, and being shown to 
the coffee room, which was rather dimly illuminated, I took rather 
fright (you know my anxious temper) at a lean, long, stiff sort of 
man, midway between parson and commis-voyageur, solitarily and 
motionlessly seated before the chimney. From the vagueness of his 
glanceless eye, I thought him a blind man. I was confirmed in that 
notion by some long, scarf-like, narrow white thing spread over his 
legs,  with regular holes in it. I fancied it to be paper outcut by the 
blind man to serve as a catchpenny from the frequenters of the 
inn. When my supper arrived the man began somewhat to wave, 
quietly took off his boots and warmed his elephantine feet at the 
fire. What with this agreeable spectacle, and his supposed 
blindness, and what with a rump steak, which seemed, in its 
natural state, to have belonged to a deceased cow, I passed the 
first Margate evening anything but comfortably. But, in compensa­
tion, the bedroom was snug, the bed clean and elastic and the 
sleep sound. When at the breakfast table, who should step in but 
the man of the evening. He turned out to be deaf and not blind. 
What had so much vexed me—I mean the thing on his 
knees—was a pocket handkerchief of singular fashion, with a 
greyish ground interspersed by black eyes which I had mistaken 
lor holes. Feeling shy of the man, I settled my bill as soon as 
possible and, after some erratic course, hit upon my present 
lodging, in front of the sea, a large sitting room and a bedroom, 
10/- per week. When striking my bargain the additional clause was 
agreed upon that, on your arrival, you will get your bedroom for 
nothing. 
The first thing I did was to take a warm sea-bathe. It was 
delicious, so is the air here. It is a wonderful air.

5 Lansell's Place 
My dear Child, 
From the address you will see that I have been banished, by my 
medical adviser, to this seaside place, which, at this time of the 
year, is quite solitary. Margate lives only upon the Londoners, who 
regularly inundate it at the bathing season. During the other 
months it vegetates only. For my own part right glad I am to have 
got rid of all company, even that of my books. I have taken a 
private lodging which fronts the sea. In an inn or Hotel one might 
have been exposed to the danger of falling in with a stray 
traveller, or being pestered by local politics, vestry interests, and 
neighbourly gossip. As it is, 'I care for nobody, and nobody cares 
for me'.a But the air is wonderfully pure and reinvigorating, and 
you have here at the same time sea air and mountain air. I have 
become myself a sort of walking stick, running up and down the 
from the English folk-song 'The Miller of the Dee'

whole day, and keeping my mind in that state of nothingness 
which Buddhaism considers the climax of human bliss. Of course, 
you have not forgotten the pretty little diction: 'When the devil 
was sick, the devil a monk would be; when the devil was well, the 
devil a monk was he.' 
Withdrawing a little from the seaside, and roaming over the 
adjacent agricultural districts, you are painfully reminded of 
'civilisation', because from all sides you are startled by large 
boards, with governmental proclamations on them, headed: Cattle 
Disease. The ruling English oligarchs were never suspected to care 
one farthing for 'der Menschheit ganzes Weh', a but as to cows and 
oxen, they feel deeply. At the opening of Parliament, the horned 
cattle gentlemen of both houses, commoners and lords, made a 
wild rush at government. All their talk sounded like a herd of 
cows'  lowing, translated into English. And they were not like 
honest king Wiswamitra, 'der kämpfte und büsste für die Kuh 
Sabalah'. b On the contrary. They seized the opportunity to 'battre 
monnaie" 2 out of the cows' ailings at the expense of the people. 308 
By the by, the East sends us always nice things—Religion, 
Etiquette, and the Plague in all forms. 
I am very glad to hear of Waaràtje's d winding up adventure. 
Verily, verily, I tell thee, my sweet little cousin, I always felt deep 
sympathy for the man, and always hoped that one day or other he 
should fix his melting heart in the right direction, and not 
persevere performing the nasty part in the children's tale: 'The 
Beast and the Beauty'. c I'm sure he will make a good husband. Is 
his inamorata a 'Bommelerin' or an importation? 
A few days before leaving London, I made the acquaintance of 
Mr Orsini, a very fine fellow, the brother of the Orsini who was 
sent to the grave for sending Bonaparte to Italy.309 He has now 
left England for the U. States, in commercial matters, but during 
the few days of our acquaintance, he did me good service. 
Although an intimate friend of Mazzini's, he is far from sharing 
a 'all misery of mankind'. Paraphrase of a passage from Schiller's poem 'Das 
Eleusische Fest': 'doch der Menschheit Angst und Wehen / Fühlet mein gequältes 
Herz' (yet the pains and woes of humans / ever fill my tortured heart) - b 'who 
wrangled and suffered for the cow Sabalah'—an episode from the epic poem 
Ramayana; used by Heine in Buch der Lieder, 'Die Heimkehr' (Marx gives a free 
rendering of the words from Heine's poem; see this volume, p. 245). - c 'coin 
money' - rf  Waaràtje ('really', 'indeed')—the word always used by student Petrus 
from Hildebrand's novel Camera obscura. Marx presumably refers in this letter to 
pastor Roodhuizen who later became Antoinette's husband.- e 'La Belle et la Bête',

the antiquated antisocialist and theocratical views of Mazzini. Now, 
during my forced and prolonged absence from the Council of the 
International Association, Mazzini had been busy in stirring a sort 
of revolt against my leadership. 'Leadership' is never a pleasant 
thing, nor a thing I ambition. I have always before my mind your 
father's3  saying in regard to Thorbecke that 'der Eselstreiber den 
Eseln immer verhasst ist'. b But having once fairly embarked in an 
enterprise which I consider of import, I certainly, 'anxious' man as 
I am, do not like to give way. Mazzini, a most decided hater of 
freethinking and socialism, watched the progress of our society 
with great jealousy. His first attempt of making a tool of it and 
fastening upon it a programme and declaration of principles of his 
hatching, I had baffled. c His influence, before that time very 
great with the London working class, had sunk to zero. He waxed 
wroth, when he saw that we had founded the English Reform 
League100  and a weekly paper, The Commonwealth, to which the 
most advanced men of London contribute, and of which I shall 
send you a copy after my return to London. His anger increased, 
when the editors of the Rive gauche (the journal of la jeune 
France? directed by Rogeard, author of the Propos de Labienus, 310 
Longuet, etc.) joined us, and when he became aware of the spread 
of our society on the Continent. He improved my absence, to 
intrigue with some English workingmen, raise their jealousies 
against 'German' influence, and even sent his bully, a certain 
Major Wolff (a German by birth) to the Council there to lodge his 
complaints and more or less directly to denounce me. He wanted 
to be acknowledged as 'the leader (I suppose par la grace de dieu*) 
of the continental democratical movement'. In so doing, he acted 
so far quite sincerely, as he utterly abhors my principles which, in 
his eyes, embody the most damnable 'materialism'. This whole 
scene was enacted behind my back, and after they had made sure 
that my malady would not allow me to be present. The English 
wavered, but, although still very weak, I rushed to the following 
séance, Mr Orsini accompanying me. On my interpellation, he 
declared them that Mazzini had lost his influence even in Italy and 
was,  from his antecedents and prejudices, quite disabled from 
understanding the new movement. 311 All the Foreign secretaries 
declared for me, and, if you, our Dutch secretary,312 had been 
present, I hope you would have also cast your vote for your 
humble servant and admirer. As it was, I carried a complete

Very good news indeed! I prefer Mrs Grach to the mother of all

escape being pestered with local politics, vestry scandals, and

mood, seems to expect. The toothache on the right side of the 
face has not yet altogether disappeared, and the same side is 
afflicted with an inflammation of the eye. Not that there is much 
to be seen of it, but that eye has taken to the vicious habit of 
shedding tears on its own account, without the least regard to the 
feelings of his master. But for this state of things, I should have 
my photogramme already taken, since you get here 12 cartes de 
visite for 3 s. 6 d. and 48 cartes for 10 sh. Mummelchen a will 
oblige me by pacing her steps to Mr Hall and ordering him to 
prepare a solution of zink (he will know the composition of the 
drug) for my eye the which I expect to find ready on my arrival at 
London. This bad eye interferes with my nightrest. Otherwise, I 
am turning [over] a new  leaf. 
Withdrawing somewhat from the seaside, and roaming over the 
adjacent rustic district, you are painfully reminded of 'civilisation' 
by large boards, staring at you everywhere, headed 'Cattle 
Disease', and placarded over with a government proclamation, the 
result of the wild rush which the horned cattle gentry, lords and 
commoners, made at the government, on the opening of 
Parliament.308 
Oh, oh King Wiswamitra 
What fool of an oxen art thou, 
That thou so much wrangle'st and suffer'st 
And all that for a cow. 
But if honest Wiswamitra, like a true Indian, tormented himself 
for the salvation of the cow Sabala, those English gentry, in the 
true style of modern martyrs, bleed the people to compensate 
themselves for their cows' ailings. The horn plague upon them! 
The horn, the horn, as discreet By Bye rings it lustily. 
On Sunday, I made up my mind to walk per pedes" to 
Canterbury. Unhappily, I only formed this grand resolution, after 
having already measured for two hours the length and breadth of 
the piers and so forth. So I had already expended too much 
physical power, when I set out for the archbishop's seat or see, as 
you like. And from here to Canterbury are fully 16 miles. From 
a Marx's wife Jenny - b  Heinrich Heine, 'Den König Wiswamitra' (from Buch der 
Lieder, 'Die Heimkehr'). Marx quotes an English translation of the second stanza of the 
poem, which in the German original reads as follows: 
O, König Wiswamitra 
O, welch ein Ochs bist du, 
Dass du so viel kämpfest und büssest 
Und alles für eine Kuh!

Canterbury I returned to Margate by rail, but I had overworked 
myself,  and could not sleep during the whole night. Limbs and 
loins were not tired, but the plants of my feet turned out tender 
hearted rogues. As to Canterbury, you know, of course, all about 
it, and more than I can boast, from your Eves, the trusted source 
of knowledge for all English Eves. (One cannot help, in your 
company, bad punning. But mark, Thackeray did worse, by 
playing upon Eves and Ewes.) Happily, I was too tired, and it was 
too late, to look out for the celebrated cathedral. Canterbury is an 
old, ugly, medieval sort of town, not mended by large modern 
English barracks at the one, and a dismal dry Railway Station at 
the other end of the oldish thing. There is no trace of that poetry 
about it, which you find in continental towns of the same age. The 
swaggering of the private soldiers and the officers in the streets, 
reminded me somewhat of Vaterland. 3 In the inn, where I was 
scantily purveyed with some slices of cold  beef,  I caught the 
newest scandal. Captain Le Merchant, it seems, had been taken up 
by the police on Saturday night, for systematically knocking at the 
doors of all the most respectable citizens. And a summons will be 
taken out against the Captain because of this innocent pastime. 
And the redoubtable Captain will have to bend down his 
diminished head before aldermanic majesty. This is my whole 
packet of 'Canterbury Tales'.^ 
And now, Cacadou, pay my compliments to Ellyc  to whom I shall 
write one of those days, and whose little letter was very welcome. 
As to Möhmchen, d she will hear of me by the by. 
That damned boy Lafargue pesters me with his Proudhonism, 
and will not rest, it seems, until I have administered to him a 
sound cudgelling of his Creole pate. 
My good wishes to all.

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS 
IN BARMEN 
Manchester, 22 March 1866 
Dear Hermann, 
Your document is with the LAWYER. Unfortunately, he was out 
today when I called, so I can't tell you whether he has already sent 
it to Liverpool, nor what progress has been made with the relevant 
fair copies. But I shall call again one day soon to prod him. 
I am writing to you today about the statement of my account 
which you sent to me and which had to wait until I had a quiet 
day to look through, as your entries for the last half year of 1864 
have been done quite differently from ours. I therefore had to go 
through all the stuff again from the beginning and have at last 
sorted it out. The items coincide with the exception of the 
remittances which, according to your letter of 20 July 1864, were 
credited direct to my account with F. Engels & Co., so I shall 
presumably find these items in my statement of account with 
F. Engels & Co. These items are: 
Remittance via Apolda £ 2. 2. 2 
1864,  30 June (» Munich >» 1. 2. — 
1» Rieslingen » 8. 19. 6 
3 July » London tot. » 287. 3. 3 
I find that, according to your statements of account I am 
actually losing money m respect of the transferred balances 
debited to me here. The exact calculation of the difference for the 
18 months amounts to £ 1. 14. 9, and in future I shall therefore 
take the liberty of sending you a statement every 6 months for I 
naturally have no alternative but to accept the statements of the 
firm here. For my convenience, I am still keeping your account 
here separate as well. 
Please be so good as to send me a summary statement of my 
account with F. Engels & Co. as soon as  possible,  so that I can make 
up my private account-book. And from mid-year 1864, of course, 
as I have had no statement for this account from you since then at 
all—as far as I am aware. (If you didn't make up the account in 
mid-year 1864, then from the beginning of 1864.)

Business has got better again since last September; we have been 
fully occupied since then, at present even excessively so, and are 
setting up new DT-machines. Prices have improved too, and in the 
last half-year of 1865 we have even made enough to cover my 
costs from June 1864 onwards, with a little left over for myself as 
well; in the first year of my PARTNERSHIP we didn't make a brass 
farthing, you know, even without writing anything off for 
machinery. We must be doing splendid business now, but if cotton 
should drop below 18d. for MIDDLING ORLEANS owing to the greater 
supply, we shall lose everything again. However, I'm not expecting 
that to happen; I think good American cotton will, by and large, 
hold at approx. 19d., while Surat may admittedly fall a lot. 
Moreover, I think we are not getting more cotton than we need 
and will, by and large, stay at approx. 19d. for MIDDLING ORLEANS 
until about the autumn, when there may perhaps be some more 
speculating, which will force prices up. 
I shall be writing to Mother" in a day or two, as soon as I can 
manage it; I received her letter last Monday and was glad to learn 
she is well again now. My kindest regards to her and all our 
brothers and sisters from 
Your 
Friedrich 
Apropos. As you know, the capital credited to me here 
amounted to a little over £13,000 as far back as 30 June 1864, and 
since I am under no obligation to have more than £ 12,000 in the 
business, there is no need for you to provide cover for purchases 
through us; or I could send you some remittances, especially as 
approx. another £ 300 is due in interest at the end of June. I can 
also make payments to Funke on your account if you so wish; in 
this way, you can draw approx. £ 1,500 up to 30 June, or at once. 
Only please do not draw bills on us, since Gottfried b objects, he 
thinks people might regard it as improper practice, the name of 
the firms being one and the same. 
Antonc already has 4-5 patents now. There is no stopping him, 
every other day a new patent of his is announced in the press.

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
Margate, 24 March 1866 
5 Lansell's Place 
Dear FRED, 
The belated arrival of this letter will tell you how 'professionally' 
I am applying my time here. I am reading nothing, am writing 
nothing. The mere fact of having to take the arsenic three times a 
day obliges one to arrange one's time for meals and for strolling 
by the sea and over the adjacent HILLS in such a way that one finds 
'no time' for anything else. And in the evening one is too tired to 
do anything other than sleep. The weather is, by and large, rather 
raw, and in particular there is often an east wind blowing here, 
which is SOMEWHAT CHILLING, but one soon becomes accustomed to 
that, too. You can tell how much I am restored from the fact that 
last Sunday I marched per pedes" to Canterbury (17 miles from 
here) in less than 4 hours. As regards company here, it does not 
exist, of course. I can sing with the MILLER OF THE DEE: 'I CARE FOR 
NOBODY AND NOBODY CARES FOR ME.' 
The day before yesterday' I had to go to London in the evening 
to attend a 'soirée' of my daughters. My uncle d had sent them £ 5 
at Christmas, which was, however, 'borrowed' from them for 
GENERAL  PURPOSES  and which they only got back when your money 
arrived. Thev arranged their annual 'PARTY' with it and so 
bombarded me with letters that I 'made' for London, as Mr 
Nothjung used to say. But I returned to my hermitage here the 
very next morning (i. e., yesterday). 
Before setting off for Margate (which I did on Wednesday, 14 
March6), I had to attend the consecutive evening meetings, on 12 
and 13 March, firstly of the  SHAREHOLDERS  of The Commonwealth290 
and secondly, on the 13th, of the CENTRAL COUNCIL, although still in 
a thoroughly wretched condition at the time. 
On the former occasion Mr Cremer had set everything up for 
Eccarius to be given his marching orders, which would probably 
a on foot - b from the English folk-song 'The Miller of the Dee' - c 22 March -
d Lion Philips - e Presumably this is not correct, for Marx arrived at Margate on 
Thursday, 15 March (see this volume, p. 239).

have happened  if I had not  appeared.  So, the  meeting only 
achieved  the  'voluntary' resignation  of Mr  Cremer from  the 
editorial board.  How the  matter turned  out  later,  I do not  know, 
since  the  whole thing  was  only  SETTLED  'provisionally'  for one  week, 
and the  general  SHAREHOLDERS-MEETING  was  deferred  to 19  March.  But 
it will probably mean beati possidentes3 here  too, and as a  result  of 
that meeting Eccarius  was, to  begin with,  the  possidetis.* 
The intrigue  on the  CENTRAL COUNCIL  was  closely bound  up  with 
the RIVALRIES  and  JEALOUSIES  concerning  the  journal  (Mr  Howell 
wished  to be  EDITOR-IN-CHIEF  and Mr  Cremer ditto).  Mr Le Lubez 
had used this  to  agitate against  GERMAN INFLUENCE,  and at the 
meeting  of 6  March  a beautifully  and  quietly prepared scene took 
place.  To wit,  Major Wolff suddenly appeared  and  made  a solemn 
speech  in his own  name  and in  Mazzini's  and in  that  of the  ITALIAN 
SOCIETY 20 against  the  reply  to Vesinier's attacks, which Jung  had 
sent to the  Echo  de Verviers  in the  name  of the  CENTRAL COUNCIL. 274 
He made  a very violent attack  on  Jung  and  (impliciterc ) myself. 
Odger, Howell, Cremer,  and  others gave vent  to their longstand­
ing Mazzinism.  Le Lubez  fed the  flames  and,  AT  ALL  EVENTS,  a 
resolution  was  passed which included what amounted  to an  amende 
honorable 6 for  Mazzini,  Wolff,  etc. It was a  serious matter,  as you 
can see. (Of the  FOREIGNERS,  there were only  A FEW PRESENT,  and  none 
of them voted.)  It would really  be a  neat trick  of Mazzini's  to let 
me bring  the  Association  so far and  then  to appropriate  it for 
himself.  He  demanded that  the  English should recognise  him as 
leader  of the  continental democrats,  as though  it was for the 
English gentlemen  to appoint leaders  for us\ 
On Saturday  (10  March)  the  FOREIGN SECRETARIES  of the  Association 
gathered  at my  house  to hold  a council  of war  (Dupont, Jung, 
Longuet, Lafargue, Bobczyriski).  It was  resolved that, whatever 
happened,  I was to  attend  the  COUNCIL  on  Tuesday (13th)  and 
protest against  the  PROCEEDINGS  in the  name  of all the  FOREIGN-
SECRETARIES.  The  PROCEEDINGS  were irregular,  you see, as  Wolff  is no 
longer  a MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL,  therefore  no  resolution  on a  matter 
in which  he was  personally implicated ought  to be  passed  in his 
presence. Furthermore,  I was to  explain Mazzini's position vis-à-vis 
both our Association and the  CONTINENTAL WORKINGMENS PARTIES,  etc. 
Finally,  the  French were  to bring Cesare Orsini  (who is  BY THE BY  a 
personal friend  of  Mazzini) along  to give  EVIDENCE  on  Mazzini, 
Wolff and the  STATE OF SOCIALISM'  in Italy.

The affair went  off  better than  I had  ever expected313; though 
the English element  was  unfortunately  not  well represented  (on 
account  of the  bloody Reform League155).  I gave that Lubez  a 
thorough dressing down.  In any  case,  it has  been made clear  to 
the English  (in  fact only  a minority  is meant here,  too)  that  the 
whole  CONTINENTAL ELEMENT  stands behind me as one man and that 
here  it is by no  means,  as Mr  Lubez  had  insinuated,  a case  of 
GERMAN INFLUENCE.  Lubez had sought to put it to them that as  LEADER 
of the  ENGLISH ELEMENT  on the  COUNCIL,  I was holding  DOWN  the other 
CONTINENTAL ELEMENTS;  the English gentlemen are, on the contrary, 
now persuaded that by means of the  CONTINENTAL ELEMENT  I have got 
them entirely under  my  thumb, should they kick over  the  traces. 
More about that next time. 
Before coming here,  I did, of  course,  pay off the  most pressing 
DEBTS  at home,  as otherwise  I should  not  have  had a  moment's 
peace  of mind.  If you can  send  me a  little  bit  more  at the end of 
this month,  I would appreciate  it.  Meanwhile,  the  power  of 
attorney from  the  Cape3 will  be here  at last,  and  thus something 
will at least  be flowing into  the  coffers, even  if it is not  very much.

reassured me not a little, as I was beginning to suspect that another 
carbuncle might be the reason for your obstinate silence. You 
must keep taking plenty of exercise and continue visiting the 
archbishop in Canterbury per pedes," that is the sure way to 
eradicate it once and for all. In this case, and in others, too, the

from  the  moment  the  paper established  itself. I  warned  him to no 
avail.  It was a  'political' error  on my  part  to have given  way to his 
entreaties  and  proposed  him by  letter  for his now  defunct  job. If I 
had not  been  ill, he  would have knocked  on the  door  in vain.  I 
knew  in advance that  I would find  the  affair coming home  to 
roost. Avoidance  of any  appearance  of pursuing personal interests 
or abusing personal influence  for  clandestine purposes,  and  good 
understanding with  the  English must,  of course,  be  more 
important  to us  than satisfying Eccarius' more  or less justified 
ambition. 
People  of a dry  disposition like Eccarius also have  a certain  dry 
egoism, which easily leads them astray. When  the  REFORM LEAGUE 
decided  on the big  MEETING  in St  Martin's Hall,267  the  League's 
COUNCIL  nominated  him as one of the  PUBLIC  SPEAKERS.  The  fellows  in 
Potter's clique objected  to him as a  FOREIGNER.  I warned  him 
expressly  not to  accept  his  'BRIEF'. However,  he thought  he had got 
over all his  troubles  and  flattered himself with  the  important part 
in the  METROPOLITAN  MOVEMENT.  And he was  A DEAD  FAILURE.  The  poor 
fellow  has, of  course, lived  a life  of  DISAPPOINTMENTS,  and the 
honorary positions  the  English  SPONTANEOUSLY  allowed  him, as 
Vice-President  of the  'INTERNATIONAL',  etc.,  deceived  him to the 
point where  he now  believed  he could suddenly make  up for the 
whole  of his  past life.  If he had  followed  me,  operated slowly, 
maintained  a modest posture, everything would  be in the  best  of 
order.  If I  even went  so far as to  muddy myself  for his  sake, 
despite  his lack  of discipline  and his  wilful behaviour,  I was  moved 
to do so  particularly  by the  consideration that  he has  always 
worked with  us and  never reaped  the  fruits  of it. But one  always 
makes BLUNDERS  if one  allows oneself  to be  influenced  by suchlike 
considerations. 
As regards  the  newspaper  itself,3 the  danger—arising from lack 
of funds—lies  in the  growing encroachments  and  dominance  of 
the Nonconformist clique.b 
The accursed traditional nature  of all  English movements  is 
manifesting itself again  in the  REFORM-MOVEMENT.  The  same 'INSTAL­
MENTS'  which  but a few  weeks  ago  were rejected with  the  utmost 
indignation  by the  people's party—they  had  even refused Bright's 
ultimatum  of HOUSEHOLD  SUFFRAGE—are  now  treated  as a  prize worthy 
to be fought  for. And  why? Because  the Tories  are screaming blue 
murder.31j These fellows lack  the  METTLE  of the old  Chartists.

What  do you  think  of the  Austro-Prussian troubles316?  I see no 
continental papers  at all.  However,  it is at  least clear  to me  that 
Russia  is behind  the  Prussians  and  that  the  Austrians,  who  know 
this, are  nolens volens" consoling themselves with French support.  A 
pretty game these heads  of state  are  playing!  It is the  eternal 
dilemma  the  German philistine confronts  us  with  at every turn. 
For Bonaparte, real  CIVIL  WAR IN  GERMANY  would be a true  GODSEND. 
Admittedly, there  is still always  the  possibility that  one  fine  day 
the affair will simply  end  with  the  worthy Bismarck's dismissal. 
But since Düppel, 27 'William  the  Conqueror' b believes  his  'glorious

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN MARGATE 
Manchester, 2 April 1866 
Dear Moor, 
I hope you have received the £10 which I sent to you in 
Margate. I was in Wales over the holiday and have at last got 
round to writing to you today. 
Orsini called on me, but unfortunately I could do nothing for 
him; I have no connections of any kind in New York any more, 
and it is OUT  OF THE QUESTION to find anyone here to run the guano 
DODGE with him and advance the funds for it. He is a very nice 
fellow. 
Polish article No. 3a will be done tomorrow evening, if nothing 
interferes. I shall send it direct to Eccarius, CARE OF EDITOR OF The 
Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the proof-reading is so abysmal, and 
it's about time that they stopped reprinting the LEADERS from The 
Nonconformist every week. It really is sheer impudence on Miall's 
part to pass the newspaper off so openly as a mere appendix of 
The Nonconformist. 
What do you say to Bismarck? It almost looks now as if he is 
pushing for war and is thereby offering Louis Bonaparte a 
splendid opportunity to acquire a piece of the left bank of the 
Rhine without any effort and thus set himself up à vie. h Even 
though all those who bear any responsibility for this war—if it 
comes to that—deserve hanging, and I would with equal 
impartiality gladly extend that to the Austrians as well, yet I would 
most of ali like to see the Prussians soundly thrashed. Then there 
are 2 possibilities: 1. the Austrians will dictate the peace in Berlin 
within a fortnight, and direct intervention from abroad will 
thereby be avoided, but at the same time the present regime in 
Berlin will be made impossible, and there will be another 
movement which will disavow the specific nature of the Prussian 
regime right from the outset; or 2. there will be a sudden change 
in Berlin before the Austrians arrive, in which case the new 
movement will also get under way. 
My opinion of the military situation is that the two armies are 
more or less evenly matched, and that the battles will prove very

bloody. In any case, however, Benedek is a better general than 
Prince Frederick Charles, and unless Francis Joseph assists 
Benedek or Frederick Charles has some very good and influential 
staff officers, I believe the Prussians are in for a drubbing. Alone 
the braggery after Düppel 27 indicates that another Jena is pos­
sible. 203 
If the first battle ends in a decisive defeat for the Prussians, 
there will be nothing to stop the Austrians advancing on Berlin. If 
Prussia wins, she has not the power to launch and sustain an 
offensive to Vienna across the Danube, let alone to Pest and 
beyond. Austria is quite capable of imposing a peace on Prussia 
SINGLE-HANDED, although Prussia cannot do so on Austria. Every 
Prussian success would thus be an encouragement to Bonaparte to 
intervene. Furthermore, both the German swine will now already 
be seeking to outbid each other with offers of German territory to 
the third, French, swine.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN MARGATE 
Manchester, 6 April 1866 
Dear Moor, 
That the Russians are behind the Prussians at once struck me as 
very probable, too. The mere fact that the Austrian paper guilder 
is almost at par again and will thus have to be disturbed again, 
aroused suspicion, but the simultaneous Cuza affair318  even more 
so, and ce cher a Bismarck would not have put out all his efforts if he 
did not have the Russians behind him. It is possible that things are 
so far committed already that neither Bismarck nor that old 
a that dear

jackass William have a say in the matter any more and that it 
depends entirely on the whim of the St Petersburgers whether 
there shall be war or peace. How clumsily this Bismarck is acting, 
incidentally. It is too absurd how he tries to represent the poor 
Austrians as the attacking party. Even more splendid, however, is 
the fact that the fellow is seriously thinking of convening a 
German parliament on 1 June to reform the federal constitution. 
This is to be a remedy against the smaller states: he— lui 
Bismarck"—is appealing to the people instead of to the govern­
ments. That even called forth universal derisive laughter from the 
German philistines. 316 
After the upheaval that has occurred on The Commonwealth,1' by 
the way, I was no longer able to get the said articlesc  to the editors 
on time, as they would have had to take the roundabout route via 
Margate, so I am sending them to you for the next number. I 
found the relevant data on the emancipation of the Russian serfs 
in an article by Mazade, Revue des II Mondes. d 
And how is your health now? You haven't had any further 
carbuncles or small furuncles? And how are you otherwise, are 
you building yourself up? Are you still visiting old 'Cantuar"" per 
pedes1? The arsenic must be taken for at least 3 months, and will 
not do you the slightest harm anyway. 
Otherwise, there is nothing new here except for a foul east wind 
and clouds of dust. 
How much longer are you thinking of staying in Margate? At 
least until the end of this month, I hope? 
Reform movement—general admission of general indolence. 
What a tiny  INSTALMENT!  31D

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
Margate, 6 April 1866 
5 Lansell's Place 
DEAR FRED, 
I have been greatly restored here, and not the smallest sign of a 
return of the atrocious carbuncles. The spot where the last and 
most malignant one was still feels a little tender. Perhaps it healed 
too quickly and an atom of pus is still lurking beneath the healed 
skin. However, if that were so, the warm sea bathes and the rough 
towel that I dry myself with would no doubt have dissipated the 
foul matter; and indeed in the last two days this vestige of the 
wound seems to be disappearing altogether. The only drawback is 
a recurrence here of rheumatic pains in my right shoulder, which 
is seriously disturbing my sleep. I have now been here for nearly 4 
weeks and have lived for my health's sake alone. It is time to put a 
stop to that soon. 
Our letters crossed, so that you have answered mine. You do 
not mention the possibility of Italy creating a diversion for 
Prussia's benefit. 
There can be no shadow of doubt that Russia is behind the 
Prussians, although she is allowing Mr Bonaparte to act as arbiter 
on the stage. One must not lose sight of the fact (to use a Hegelian 
turn of phrase) that the DANUBIAN MINE318  WAS SPRUNG at the very 
moment that Bismarck made his démarche. 316 
Even granted, which is probable, that the Prussian curs 
withdraw with their tails between their legs, it remains clear, and 
must become clear even to the German philistines, that unless there 
is a revolution in Germany, the Hohenzollern and Habsburg curs 
will throw our country back for another 50-100 years by civil 
(dynastic) war. 
I must tell you frankly that the 'INTERNATIONAL' is in a sorry state, 
particularly since the impatience of the French has led to the 
congress being fixed for the end of May.286 
THE FACT  IS THIS, that the English LEADERS in London, now that we 
have given them a platform (to which must be added the inability 
of any Englishman to do two things at once), are very cool within 
our MOVEMENT proper. My absence for almost 3 months has done 

=====第297页=====
152. Engels to Hermann Engels. 6 April 1866 259 
untold harm. What is to be done? In France, Belgium, Swit­
zerland (and here and there in Germany, and even sporadical­
ly in America) the Association has made great and sustained 
progress. In England, the reform movement, which we brought 
into being, has almost KILLED us. That would be of no consequence, 
if the Geneva Congress had not been announced for the end of 
May, and if the Parisians, for whom this movement is the sole 
possibility, had not, through their own paper Le Congrès, made it 
almost impossible to prorogue the congress. 319 The English would 
soon see the rottenness of the REFORM MOVEMENT, as it now is. After 
my return the threat of flirtation with the Potter-clique, etc., would 
soon put everything back on the right lines. But  THERE  IS NO TIME.  For 
the English even the FAILURE of the congress is a trifle. But for us? A 
fiasco of European dimensions!! I really do see scarcely a way out. The 
English have neglected to do anything which might give the congress 
any kind of respectable form. Que faire!* Do you think I should go to 
Paris to put to the people there how impossible the congress now is? 
Answer soon. The only possible way out I can see is by agreement 
with the Parisians. On the other hand, I know that their position 
itself is at stake if the congress does not take place. Que faire! Mr 
Vésinier has challenged our Parisians. They are to go to Belgium to 
shoot it out with him. L'imbécile. As  TO Orsini, I knew that there was 
nothing you could do. But I could not refuse him the introduction to 
you. b

Best thanks for your statement of account for 27 March, which 
appears to be in order by and large. The only thing is, it is hard to

check the interest if it is not given in detail as in other statements, 
and one just has to take the 'interest-account' at its word. But 
then, on 31 December 1865, you credit me with the transfer of 
2,112,21.8 talers from Ermen & Engels, Barmen, whilst according 
to E. & E., Barmen's statement, the same transfer amounts to 
£316.18.2 and à 6I20 makes 2,169.1.8 talers. I can make no sense 
of that. 
It is rather awkward that you make up your accounts on 31 
December, whereas we do so on 30 June. I shall therefore only 
send you a statement once, on 31 December, which will thus never 
coincide with yours, but in the end it will make no odds. 
To keep our entries clear, I would be glad if you would enter all 
business items from E. & E. under E. & E., Barmen, and all private 
items under F. Engels & Co. 
I passed the information on the agent Brown straight on to 
Fr. Boelling; Karth wrote to us about a different matter. 
I do not advise you to obtain your SEWINGS through us as a rule, 
G. Ermen will always try to palm off his yarn from Pendlebury on 
you, and that would surely not always be in your interest. Besides, 
he would at once claim payment of 2% commission from you as 
the business expands. But if you can make use of his yarn (and 
why not, since we can use it?), you had best apply to us. I am 
today posting you a sample of No. 16, of which he has 120  BALES 
[at] 10 pounds, 7 LEAS in stock, and would take 2 [s.] 1/2  d. per 
No. 16, perhaps even less. You can also obtain the same yarn 
from the broker F. A. Schmits. Fine Nos. and COPS, on the other 
hand, in which G. Ermen has no interest we can always supply 
you with. 
How much does the hock cost? That is what really matters. And 
how much of it is there? You should have sent 3 dozen bottles 
straightaway, instead of 3. 
I shall ask around about the PONIES. Good, strong COBS, however, 
are at the moment much sought after here, and expensive, and 
bargains—a good pair in one lot—not easily come by. 
You don't think there'll be war either? It would be a terrible 
business if it came to that, and there is no telling where it would 
end. Recently, when the affair first started, I dreamed that I had 
got mixed up with an enormously large army somewhere on the 
Mosel. They were volunteers of some description, all manner of 
fellows dashing about full of self-importance, and now and again 
someone would shout, 'We're surrounded!'—at which they all took 
to their heels. At length, I found my way into the headquarters 
and encountered Peter and Gottfried Ermen there as GENERALS en

chef,  and Anton3  as chief-of-staff. Now I asked him a few 
questions, but received such bizarre replies that I finally asked him 
whether he did actually have maps of the area where he was? At 
which he looked down at me from a great height and said, 'Maps? 
We do everything here much better without maps.' When I tried 
to explain to him that he really could not manage without maps, 
nor even find quarters for his men, etc., he answered, 'If 
absolutely necessary, we do have some maps', and, with a look of 
triumph, he pulled a map of a quite different area, the other side 
of Aachen and Maastricht, out of his pocket. Don't imagine I have 
just made this up as a bad joke, that is literally how it happened. 
Kindest regards to Mother b—I'll write to her one of these 
days—and to all our brothers and sisters.

I shall return to London from here the day after tomorrow. My

recovered. But another two months and more—February, March 
and half of April have thus been entirely lost to me again, and the

I was suffering from CARBUNCLES, not furuncles. It was a 
dangerous business this time. You are, of course, right that 
'dietetic' sins lay behind it. I am too accustomed to working at 
night, studying by day and writing by night. That, together with 
all manner of worries, private and public, and—whenever I am 
immersed in work—neglect of regular diet, exercise, etc., is quite 
enough to upset the blood. 
I received Mr Menke's contribution of 10 talers for the 
'International' with your letter. 3 I have not got the addresses of my 
French friends in Paris here. However, if Mr Menke approaches 
my friend K. Kaub (33, Rue des trois Couronnes du Temple), the 
latter can introduce him to V. Schily (German) and Tolain, 
Fribourg, etc., the people on the Paris Committee. 
The news from Germany is rather depressing.316 Prussia is being 
egged on by Russia (and Bonaparte), Austria by the latter 
(following on rather reluctantly, in self-defence). Will our philis-
tines at last realise that, unless there is a revolution to remove the 
Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns (it being superfluous to mention 
the lesser dung-beetles), another Thirty Years' War320 and another 
partition of Germany are ultimately inevitable! 
A movement on the part of the Italians might help Prussia. But 
just considering Austria and Prussia on their own, the latter would 
almost certainly be at a disadvantage, for all their bragging about 
Düppel. 27 At all events, Benedek is a better General than Prince 
Frederick Charles. Austria might well impose a peace on Prussia 
SINGLE-HANDED, but Prussia cannot do so on Austria. Any Prussian 
success would be an encouragement to Bonaparte to interfere. 
Bismarck may perhaps have already drawn in his horns again as 
I write these lines to you. But that, too, would only delay the 
conflict. Such a delay is probable in my opinion. 
This turmoil in Germany is an extraordinary piece of luck for 
Bonaparte. His position is completely undermined. But war would 
give him a new lease of life. 
Write to me soon, and in particular about the situation in 
Germany.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN MARGATE 
Manchester, 10 April 1866 
Dear Moor, 
To all appearances, the Russians want war, their purpose 
seeming to be restoration of Poland under Russian rule and 
possibly annexation of Moldavia. The Kölnische Zeitung, which is, 
of course, in mortal fear of war, has sent J. von Wickede, its 
military man, to Bohemia, to inspect what is claimed to be 
Austria's state of armament. The fellow arrives—on 3 April, that 
is 14 days after Bismarck's note 316—and everywhere finds things 
on a profoundly pacific footing, except that some Bohemian 
regiments have been transferred to their western districts, so that 
they can put themselves on a war footing more quickly. No 
soldiers recalled from leave, no fortress armed. Nothing.3 The 
whole disgraceful affair thus deliberately provoked by Bismarck. 
Furthermore: the Russians are concentrating troops on the 
Austrian and on the Prussian frontier with Poland, and the 
soldiers are saying quite openly that those who are positioned on 
the Prussian frontier will shortly occupy Posen as soon as the 
Prussian troops take the field against the Austrians. Apart from 
the fact that the Russians would thereby secure the rest of 
Prussian Poland for themselves immediately, their mission will also 
be to suppress any revolutionary movements in Berlin. However, 
that would in all probability be a miscalculation and, at any rate, 
disqualify the Hohenzollerns for the future. 
Finally, today's LEADER in The Times which comes down stupidly, 
mendaciously, woodenly but decisively on Prussia's side and 
represents Austria as the attacking party. That was written to 
order.b 
In view of all this, war seems to me certain; the situation within 
Germany also makes it inevitable, following the new Austrian note 
appealing to the Confederation, as well as Monsieur Bismarck's 
proposal regarding a German parliament321—what a dunderhead 
the fellow must be to believe that that would assist him even in the 
a Engels refers to the report 'Die Lage, Köln, 7. April', Kölnische Zeitung, 8 April 
1866.  - b The Times, No. 25468, 10 April 1866, leader. 

=====第303页=====
155. Engels to Marx. 10 April 1866 265 
very slightest! The Austrian note seems to be based on the 
assumption that the storm will break after all. Otherwise they 
would at least have left the back-door open to facilitate the 
Prussians' retreat through Bismarck's resignation. But the moment 
that they appeal to the Confederation, that's an end to it; another 
ministry in Prussia would not submit to a Confederation majority 
either. 
Bonaparte will probably keep quiet, at least for the time being; 
Bismarck has already offered him Saarbrücken, etc., and, if need 
be, he would also make him a present of the Bavarian Palatinate. 
If he sees the Russians committed on the Prussian side, he won't 
risk anything rash. 
If the storm really does break, for the first time in history the 
course of events will depend on the attitude taken by Berlin. If the 
Berliners hit out at the right time, things may turn out well—but 
who can rely on them? 
As regards the congress of the International, I don't properly 
see how you can hope to avoid it.a  Nor do I see how a further 
postponement would improve things much. Après tout, b any 
demonstration of that kind would in a certain sense—at least as 
far as we ourselves are concerned—always be a fiasco. But in full 
view of Europe? I believe that could still be avoided even now. 
After all, the Germans with their polyglot capacities would have 
the whole thing under their control, and it is precisely the 
Germans who are on our side. Whether the congress decides 
anything useful is a secondary matter, as long as all scandal can be 
avoided; and that surely will now be the case. General resolutions 
of a theoretical kind or referring to international support for 
strikes, etc., can surely be passed without any danger. Neverthe­
less, you must know that better than I, I cannot really judge of it 
from here. Meanwhile, I would definitely not go to Paris about it. 
You have no one to protect you, and the police will have no qualms 
about striking—emissary from a public workers' association with 
distinctly revolutionary tendencies, which can easily be used to 
conceal other clandestine matters— cela suffit" The whole business 
is just not worth the risk. 
You would do much better to stay in Margate until the last scar 
is no longer in the slightest degree susceptible, and do plenty of 
walking in the fresh air. Who knows how soon you will once more 
have need of a stout constitution. The atmosphere is highly 
electric, and we shall perhaps soon be in the midst of the storm

Dear Moor, 
As I do not  exactly know whether  you are in  Margate  at the 
moment,  I am  today sending your wife 
E/R 13430, Manchester,  21 January  1865 £10 
E/P 43331,  Manchester,  20 January  1865  £10-£20 
and am  telling  her  that  I have informed  you of it. 
So, Bismarck  has  executed  his  suffrage universel coup, 321 even 
though without  his Lassalle.  It would appear that, after some show 
of reluctance,  the  German bourgeois will  go along with  it, for 
Bonapartism really  is the  true religion  of the  modern bourgeoisie. 
It is becoming increasingly clear  to me  that  the  bourgeoisie does 
not possess  the  qualities required  to rule directly  itself, and  that 
therefore, unless there  is an  oligarchy  as here  in England capable 
of taking over,  for good  pay, the  management  of state  and  society 
in the  interest  of the  bourgeoisie,  a Bonapartist semi-dictatorship 
is the normal form;  it promotes  the  great material interests  of the 
bourgeoisie even against  the  bourgeoisie,  but  allows  it no  share  in 
the government  itself.  Conversely, this dictatorship itself  is in  turn 
compelled unwillingly  to adopt these material interests  of the 
bourgeoisie.  So, now we  have Monsieur Bismarck adopting  the 
programme  of the  National Association. 152 Its  execution  is 
admittedly quite another matter,  but  Bismarck will scarcely  be

baulked by the German bourgeois. A German, who has just 
returned from there, reports that he has already encountered 
many who have nibbled at this bait; according to Reuter (vide 3 
below), the people in Karlsruhe have approved of the matter, and 
the Kölnische Zeitung's unbounded embarrassment over the affair is 
a clear indication of a forthcoming change of course. 
That Bismarck has direct agreements with the Russians, 
however, is once more proved firstly by the fact that not only The 
Times but Reuter, too, is beginning to lie on Prussia's  behalf,  in 
complete contrast to their usual custom. There is a method in the 
mistranslations with which the telegrams are now infested more 
than ever. Until a short while ago, against Prussia. Now against 
Austria. Reuter telegraphs: Austria would only go along with the 
plan if all the Austrian provinces (that is, including the 
non-German ones) were represented. b In the German original it 
merely says: conditional upon the regions of Austria being 
represented, too.—Further: according to the Bromberger Zeitung 
and the Ostsee-Zeitung (the latter is a Russian organ), the Russians 
are continuing to gather more troops in the south-western 
provinces, from the Kingdom of Poland 322 to the Prut, doing so 
very slowly and unobtrusively; the soldiers are all expecting to 
move with Prussia against Austria, and those on the Warta repeat 
that their role is to occupy Posen so that the Prussians there can 
march away. 
The Russians can, incidentally, leave Schleswig-Holstein to the 
Prussians for the time being, as the Peace of Vienna and the 
annexation have, after all, saved the main issue for them: the 
Treaty of London and thereby the succession in Denmark 323 If 
they have the Sound,c what does Kiel signify to them? 
At all events, your best course is to stay in Margate until you no 
longer feel anything at all in the affected part, and you are in 
general convinced of a marked turn for the better. 
Write soon.

MARX TO ENGELS 324 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 23 April 1866 
Dear FRED, 
You will have had little difficulty in explaining my long silence 
as arising from the mental condition that is generated by more 
than 2 weeks of incessant toothache and rheumatism. However, a 
turning-point appears to have been reached today. 
As the pain of the rheumatism, which was particularly acute at 
night, greatly interfered with my sleep and my whole domestic 
routine—as a consequence of which I was several times attacked 
by vomiting—I thought it wise to stop, or suspend, the arsenic. 
But I shall continue with it again now (if a turning-point has really 
been reached). Nor is there the slightest sign of any furuncular or 
carbuncular bother, and I have not the slightest doubt that once I 
am over these INCIDENTS, which are connected more with the 
weather, I shall be fully restored. But indeed it is high time as I 
have already lost so much time. 
With the 'INTERNATIONAL the situation is as follows: since my 
return307 discipline has by and large been re-established. The 
successful intervention of the 'INTERNATIONAL' in the tailors' strike 
(by means of letters from the secretaries for France, Belgium, etc.) 
has also created a sensation among the TRADES UNIONS here.325 With 
respect to the Geneva Congress, I have resolved to do all that I 
can here to promote its success, but not to attend it in person. I 
thereby evade all personal responsibility for its conduct.3 
As far as The Commonwealth is concerned, the ENCROACHMENTS of 
Miall et Co. would be more tolerable if they were at least founded 
on the pretext of financial assistance really worthy of mention. But 
the fellows are exceedingly liberal with good advice and petty 
criticisms, and exceedingly parsimonious with CASH, SO that the 
existence of the paper is assured only from one week to the next.

then that is thanks to Fox alone, who has to fight a continuing 
battle. 
For the present, they do not seem to be coming to blows in the 
Fatherland after all. Prussian braggadocio is slow indeed to draw 
the sword! Whatever the outcome, we shall have the pleasure of a 
Prussian disgrace before both a domestic and foreign audience. 
For all that, it still seems uncertain whether war might not break 
out one fine morning. The Russians want war (although they have 
indeed already gained and are continuing to gain much merely 
from the bickering and bellicose threats in Germany), and for 
Bonaparte it would be a GODSEND. At all events, Mr Bismarck has set 
'the movement' going again in Germany. 
The phase of the Civil War" over, only now have the UNITED 
STATES  really entered the revolutionary phase, and the European 
WISEACRES who believe in the omnipotence of Mr Johnson will soon 
be disappointed. 
In England, the Tories and Palmerstonian Whigs really deserve 
thanks for frustrating Russell's quiet SETTLEMENT.326 At one of the 
latest sittings, Mr Gladstone  himself,  expressed his 'melancholy' 
conviction that now, quite contrary to his benevolent expectations, 
a 'long series of struggles' was imminent.

go on with  the  arsenic,  it should  be taken  for at  least  3 months 
and is quite unconnected with  the  rheumatism,  etc. The  liver 
troubles  may  have been  a factor contributing  to the  carbuncles,  by 
disturbing  the  digestion  or blood-formation,  and, for  that very 
reason,  you  will also have  to go on  taking several hours continuous 
exercise regularly each  day and  keep  off working  at night,  so that 
everything  can  return  to  normal. Where  the  tendency  to 
hyperaemia  of the  liver  has  established itself  in such  a classic  and 
systematic form  as in  your case,  it does  not, of  course, just vanish 
again  all at  once. 
It's good that  you  have  no more worries about  the  congress  and 
the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION.  Apropos, a shipload of 57 German 
tailors  has  been imported  to Edinburgh TO PUT DOWN  A STRIKE  and 2 
more loads  are  expected. Probably from Hamburg.  Can you not 
discover  the  details  in Edinburgh  and put a  stop  to this, too?327 
Bismarck wants  war à tout prix?  and after  he failed  in Bohemia, 
he seems likely  to succeed  in Italy. 328 I hope that,  if he  pulls  it off, 
the Berliners will  hit out. If  they proclaim  a republic there,  the 
whole  of Europe  can be  overturned  in 14  days.  But, but,  will they? 
How  do our  connections there stand? 
Have  you  seen  how  little Louis Blanc,  as a  good démocrate

smaller German states, France must have  at least  the left bank  of 
the Rhine.* 5 There's  a real revolutionary  for you. 
In order  to incite  my  ancient rage somewhat,  in the  last few

perpetrated  by the  Saxons exceed everything that  I have ever 
come across. There will  be a  harsh reckoning  to be had  with  a 
large number  of villains. Such brutality  was  quite unknown  in the 
old days before  '48, and the  Prussian fortresses  of that time seem 
like paradise  in comparison.

My dear Friend, 
As I am at this moment, after so long an interruption of work,b 
very busily engaged in making up for lost time, you will excuse me 
for writing this time only a few lines. 
I shall send you to-day the last number of The Commonwealth. 
The financial position of the paper is such that it struggles from 
week to week and is altogether disabled from paying one farthing 
for Foreign Correspondence. Its circulation is increasing, but you 
know that a penny paper wants at least 20,000 subscribers, and 
cannot even then make the two ends meet without a goodly 
number of advertisements. The Commonwealth is of too recent an 
origin to come up to those requisites.

da in London has taken a new start, principally due to the 
circumstance that the successful strikes of the London tailors and 
wireworkers were due to our intervention which prevented the 
import of workingmen from France, Switzerland, Belgium, which 
had been contemplated by the masters. This proof of its 
immediate practical importance has struck the practical English 
mind. 329 
For the same purpose you find, on the last page of this letter, 
an 'avis'a to the German tailors which I call upon you to have 
inserted in such German papers as you have access  to. 327 At the 
same time you will oblige me by sending me a copy or two of some 
papers in which the 'avis' will have been inserted, telling me at the 
same time the names of all other papers that should have 
reprinted it. Kugelmann might also be useful for this purpose.

Dear FRED, 
No CARBUNCLES WHATEVER! But the accursed rheumatism and 
toothache have tormented me cruelly, until the former at last 
seems to be yielding to embrocation with pure alcohol. I must tell 
you candidly as well that my mind still feels somewhat weak and 
my capacity for work is only returning very gradually. Perhaps that 
can be attributed to the interruption in the arsenic treatment, 
which I started again after your last letter. 
Cohen38" was a very good lad (although not particularly gifted) 
for whom I have a special regard as he was an old friend of my 
Musch.a  Freiligrath naturally dashed straight to Blind yesterday 
and came to us from him. I was not at home. Freiligrath's chief 
lament was the bad name Blind was giving him and others 
(nominal contributors to the Eidgenosse* whose symbol is a hand 
holding a dagger with the motto 'haec manus tyrannis', c etc.). He

said he had not visited him for 9 months and that the affair was 
not even 'excusable'. In short, he was in fact only upset about the 
possible impression the affair might make on the London 
philistines. By the by, our trickster from Baden duped him nicely 
again. He played the broken man and gave his friend Freiligrath 
no inkling that in the first throes of grief he had the presence of 
mind to exploit the tragic incident for some good advertising for 
himself and family in the various London papers.  ALWAYS  AN EYE TO 
BUSINESS. His wifea is naturally inconsolable, and the funny thing 
about the affair is that Blind has by his idiotic regicidal blether 
sacrificed not his own son, but old Cohen's Isaac,"3 on the altar of 
freedom. 
In consequence of their sad experiences in 1859331 the 
Austrians are in the accursed situation of being scarcely capable of 
grasping the favourable moment, and although they have been 
forcibly presented with the initiative, they cannot seize it, or at 
least they will hesitate greatly before doing so. OF  COURSE,  European 
'PUBLIC  OPINION' benefits them not a tittle and requires something silly 
of them. These same liberal jackasses, who are now generally 
admitting that Austria is the challenged party and that there is a 
systematic CONSPIRACY against her, would tomorrow (the ENGLISH  LORDS 
included) scream with one voice if Austria were to strike the first 
blow and did not wait quietly for her enemies to give the signal. 
Repugnant though Bonaparte is to me, his coup in Auxerre did 
uncommonly amuse me.332  That old jackass Thiers and the chiens 
savants" of the Corps  législatif, 4 who applauded him, fancied they 
would be allowed to play with Louis-Philippism unpunished! Les 
imbéciles! 
The Russians as always are playing their part to a T. Having 
encouraged their worthy Prussians, they enter on the scene as men 
of peace and arbiters of Europe, but were, at the same time, canny 
enough to inform Mr Bonaparte that Poland could not, of course, 
be on the agenda at any congress, in short, that Russia was entitled 
to meddle in European, but not Europe in Russian affairs. 
Following upon the importation of German and Danish tailors 
to Edinburgh, we have 1. sent a German and a Daned (both tailors 
themselves) to Edinburgh, and they have already put an end to 
the understanding between IMPORTERS and IMPORTED; 2. I have put

A very disagreeable matter for me was the necessity of paying a 
lump sum of £25 for school fees. This money, for 3 quarters, 
could no longer be put off as Jenny and Laura are leaving the

from the school, you know.)

Dear Moor, 
The Freiligrath affair is very amusing and very gratifying. 
That's what comes of him attaching himself to the respectable 
people among the émigrés and renouncing the 'party'. As regards 
Blind, the fitting cry in respect of his: manus haec inimica tyrranis" 
should be that children ought not to play with guns. It is 
incidentally quite clear from the affair that Bismarck wears an 
armoured shirt. 330 The shots must all have hit him, the last 3 are 
admitted to have been direct hits, and as the revolver was so 
designed that it could not be fired in contact with the target, there 
is just no other possibility. They make these things very fine and

yet strong nowadays. His friend Bonaparte will no doubt have 
supplied him with one and recommended it to him. 
Monsieur Bismarck has obviously been gravely disappointed in 
the smaller states, hincR the threat of an imperial constitution and 
Bennigsen. There must also have been some financial mishaps. 
But can one conceive of anything more comical than that the same 
William, who as top general in the year 1849 bore the imperial 
constitution to its grave, now wants to resuscitate it, or rather has 
to. Bismarck as restorer of the 'German fundamental rights',333  it's 
too funny. Things are not looking quite as they should in the 
militia and in the reserves, who have been recalled, either; in 
Görlitz there was a serious fracas amongst them, soldiers of the 
line had to be called out and then withdraw because the fellows 
were not willing to tolerate intervention of that kind. If these 
people are kept hanging around under arms for another 3-4 
weeks, there is no knowing what they might do. And since neither 
Prussia nor Italy is ready to attack, they will presumably have to 
stick there until the end of May at least. 
This much is certain: Monsieur Bismarck has ridden into a 
morass with which neither he nor any of the present regime can 
cope.  If things are settled peaceably, he will have burnt up the 
available funds and therefore he will no longer be able to help 
himself,  and if there is war, he will have to Acheronta movere, 0 who 
will certainly consume him. In these circumstances, even a direct 
victory of the Chamber-burghers will be revolutionary in character 
and is bound to lead to other things. 
For all that, I still cannot think that in the middle of the 19th 
century North and South Germany will come to blows with each 
other, just because Bismarck would have it so in the interests of 
the Russians and Bonaparte. However, if the storm does break, it 
may go ill with the Prussians. This time, the Austrians seem to be 
intent on going to the limit of their strength, and, even if their big 
talk of 900,000 men is nonsense, it is still possible that they may 
take the field in Saxony with substantial numerical superiority. 
Against Austria, Prussia cannot draw on the Rhenish and 
Westphalian corps at all, and only on part of the Saxon. There 
remain the other six army corps, which will scarcely be able to 
muster 240,000 men to face the enemy. If, as is suggested, the 
Austrians initially remain on the defensive in Italy, they will only 
need 150,000 men there, and can perfectly well send 300-350,000 
men against Prussia—unless the Russians compel them to keep a 
a hence - b call the powers of the underworld to his aid (Virgil,  Aeneid,  VII, 312).

strong force in Galicia. The deciding battle could then be fought 
by 180,000 Prussians against 240-280,000 Austrians and would 
almost infallibly be another Jena203 and lead directly to Berlin. But 
it is difficult to speculate about this, as the Austrians' troops are 
always much stronger on paper, and they tell a lot of lies, at 
present in particular. 
Unfortunately, Monsieur Charles3 is behind with the ledger, 
which has my account in it, so that at the moment I cannot even 
properly ascertain how I stand, and as the financial year ends in 6 
weeks and I then must have a certain amount of capital in the 
business, I shall have to make my dispositions accordingly. As soon 
as I can, I shall add up my worldly assets and send you some 
money, if it is at all possible. But, at all events, you can count on 
my letting you have a £50 early in July immediately after the 
accounts for the financial year have been made up. 
The Kreuz-Zeitungb makes delightful reading, advocating as it 
does universal suffrage, Bonapartism, Victor Emmanuel, etc. The 
dirt those fellows are now being obliged to eat is abundant.

here are waiting for the next article and BOTHER ME with 
enquiries.354 The articles have created a stir in other respects, too. 
Having earlier praised them, Foxikins launched a DIATRIBE the day 
before yesterday in the Central Council against the passage in 
which you ascribe the partitioning to the corruption of the Polish 
aristocracy. Amongst other things, he singled out the Germans for 
attack, for having ruined the Poles in particular through the 
Saxon dynasty, etc. I replied to him in  brief.335 
It is true that for all their big talk the Prussians are inclined to 
draw in their horns, and Bismarck is meeting strong opposition 
from Burp,a too. But a retreat is scarcely possible in Italy, and that 
may have repercussions on Prussia again. What Izzyb is missing by 
being so dead! Bismarck would have had him playing a part now. 
Bismarck is surely cursing us (and thinking us Austrian agents) for 
spoiling his easy game with the workers. 
From the beginning of this week my workc has at last been 
advancing again. If you can send me some vino, please do so, as 
the sudden abstinence may do harm. 
Mr Mazzini gave himself no rest until he had founded an 
'INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE' in opposition to us. On it are

also—Bolleter! Our Association is gaining ground daily. Only in 
Germany nothing can be done, on account of jackass Liebknecht 
(GOOD FELLOW AS HE IS!). 
The present crisis appears to me to be merely a premature, 
specifically financial crisis. It could only become important if the 
business in the UNITED STATES goes rotten, and there would scarcely

Dear Moor, 
The PANIC has, at all events, come much too soon and may 
possibly spoil a good solid crisis for us which would otherwise have 
occurred in 1867 or 1868. If we had not simultaneously chanced 
to have the big fall in cotton, we would barely have been affected 
by it here. The collapse of the LIMITED LIABILITY and FINANCING 
swindles had after all been long foreseen and hardly affected our 
TRADE  at all. But the colossal losses on cotton which occurred 
simultaneously threaten to make it a grave matter here, so many 
houses here and in Liverpool are entangled in it through their 
branches in Bombay, etc., and as it occurred at the same time as 
the MONEY PANIC and the 10% bank-rate, it may be very grave for 
those who are holding much cotton. Here at least the business is 
far from over yet. 
If the Austrians are canny enough not to attack, that will surely 
put the cat among the pigeons in the Prussian army. The fellows 
have never been as rebellious as they are in the present 
mobilisation. Unfortunately, one only learns the tiniest part of 
what is happening, but even that is enough to prove that a war of 
attack is impossible with this army. Once these lads are concen­
trated in large numbers, and begin to count themselves and 
discover that 3/4 of the army is of one mind, and if they then have 
to hang around under arms for 3-4 weeks during the congress, 
things will inevitably lead to a crisis, and one fine morning 
obedience will be refused. Something is bound to spark it off; and 
with an army like that, once one battalion starts, it will spread like 
wildfire. But even if an open outbreak were to be avoided, it is 
certain that this army, with its MORALE as it is, and commanded by 
the old William, with Frederick Charles and the Crown Prince3 
under him commanding the wings, would at once be beaten 
beyond salvation by the furious Austrians under Benedek, who 
will have none of the Archdukes, nor any interference in the

appointment of his  staff,  and has 300-360,000 men under him. 
The old jackass3 knows that, too, and I am convinced that he will 
withdraw as soon as ever he can, precisely because of the mood in 
his armies. What I said in my pamphletb last year about the 
character of the mobilised Prussian army, has been fully confirmed. 
Delightful is the embarrassment of the National Association-
ites152  since Bismarck has plagiarised their programme; those 
fellows will now have to oppose their own Great-Prussia phrases, 
exactly as the Kreuz-Zeitung" did with its own feudal phrases. 
The London correspondent of The Manchester Guardian reports 
that in this solemn performance of state336  Louis Bonaparte has 
made the following conditions the price for his approval: Sardinia 
from Italy, Luxemburg, Saarlouis and Saarbrücken from Prussia 
(Landau is the only thing he has forgotten)—and that is the 
minimum. d 
I shall see if I can complete my article on Poland334 tomorrow. 
To be quite frank, it is a sacrifice for me to provide that jackass 
Miall with contributions when one is for ever being explicitly 
reminded that the editors do not accept responsibility for the 
section from contributors, whilst they obviously do so for the 
asininities printed elsewhere in the paper.337 If I had known 
beforehand how our pieces were going to be treated in a paper6 
which is after all supposed to be our own—or at least to belong to 
the workers' party, and that we were merely going to be thus 
tolerated in it, and we are supposed to be grateful, as it were, into 
the bargain,—  I would not have written a single line. But you were 
sick at the time, and I didn't want to do anything that might 
disturb your convalescence. But I was vexed by it nonetheless. All 
the same, one has said 'A' and must see that one also says 'B'.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  7 JUNE  1866 
DEAR FRED, 
I am in a most awkward situation: pawning has now reached its 
Thulea and I am being most furiously dunned as well. Regarding 
my physical condition, there has fortunately been no recurrence of 
anything carbuncular. However, I was obliged to go to Allen about 
my liver throuble, since Gumpert is not here and this thing cannot 
be treated from a distance. I have still nearly a whole BOTTLE of 
arsenic left, but have not taken it for several weeks now, as it is 
incompatible with my present style of life. 
Were you among the victims of the CONSOLIDATED BANK? Dr Rode 
was here the day before yesterday and maliciously reported that 
Dronke has suffered serious losses owing to the Barnett CRASH. 338 
So, there will be war after all, unless a miracle occurs. The 
Prussians will pay dearly for their bragging, and, whatever 
happens, the idyll in Germany is over. The Proudhonist clique 
among the students in Paris (Courrier français) is preaching peace, 
declaring war out of date and nationalities nonsense, and attacking 
Bismarck and Garibaldi, etc. 339 As polemic against chauvinism, 
their activities are useful and understandable. But as faithful 
followers of Proudhon (my very good friends here, Lafargue and 
Longuet, are also among that number) who believe that the whole 
of Europe must and will sit quietly on its arse until the French

Mr Alexander II, like Alexander I (in his last years), is in such a

return from Margate.307  I have been  so low  over  the  last few  weeks 
that I have  not  been able even  to  attend  the  INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION  any  more.  I had  Gumpert's prescription  (for my  liver) 
made  up for me  yesterday,  as Allen's stuff  was  of no use at all to 
me. Furthermore,  I have  had a  tooth pulled,  to put an end to the 
toothache,  and  probably  a second  one  will have  to go, too. 
If your wine-cellar permits (that  is, if you are not  thereby 
obliged  to buy in  more),  I should appreciate  it if you  would send 
me some,  as I am now  forbidden beer altogether. 
The verses await your 'commentary'. They  are  nothing  in my 
hands. 
This evening  I am  compelled  to go to the  meeting  of the 
'DIRECTORS  AND  FRIENDS'  of The Commonwealth.290  The thing is on its last 
legs.  Apart from  the  acute financial difficulties, there  are  internal 
political ones  as well. Since that jackass  of a  Bradford  MANUFACTURER, 
Mr Kell (who  has  given  £50, his  brother ditto,  and  hints  of more 
to come),  has  Miall entirely under  his  thumb,  Dr Bridges, 
Professor Beesly, Harrison  (the  COMTEISTS)  have threatened  not 
merely  to resign  but  also  to make  a public statement about their 
resignation. 
I am  tired  of the  business  and  shall propose  to the  people this 
evening that they should sell their bankrupt institution  to Kell et 
Co. and put an end to the farce of A  BRADFORD MANUFACTURER 
directing  a London 'workers' organ'.  If they  do not  agree,  I shall, 
at all  events, announce  my  withdrawal.  The  paper cannot survive 
for much longer  on its own  resources,  is therefore dependent  on 
advances  of bourgeois money,  and  thereby loses  its own  character. 
I have shown great patience  in this matter, because  I always hoped 
that the  workers themselves would make sufficient efforts  to 
continue  the  undertaking  on  their  own;  and, for  another thing,  I 
did not  want  to be a wet  blanket. 
Mr Gottfried Kinkel  has been appointed  to a  chair  in Zurich. 
Since  the  sounds  of war  started  up, the  'Saxon' workers have 
been flocking to join the  'INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION'.

Dear Moor, 
The crate of Bordeaux will be sent off to you this evening. It is 
very good wine from Borkheim. I should have sent it to you 
before, but the lads here have dilly-dallied over it, partly from 
overwork. I had written out the address for them long since. I 
hope that it and regular exercise will do you good. What do you 
say to coming up here for a week, say, end of this inst. would suit 
me, and then you could take the money straight back with you 
early in July? At the same time, you could for once have a 
thorough consultation with Gumpert. 
We have so far just escaped the spate of bank-failures 
unscathed. Dronke told me himself that he was in for a bit with 
Barnett, but more because he had had to change his banker; he 
had £3,000 credit there—however, he was also a shareholder, and 
that's where he will lose. Eichhoff also has had the honour of 
seeing his banker fail, and has come a cropper to the tune of £16. 
He is not losing any sleep over it; if he cannot pay a bill that's due, 
he just lets it be. 
Mr G. Kinkel has been putting it around every year that he has 
been offered the chair in Zurich—so, does that mean the people 
of Zurich are in fact really going to have to believe it at last? 
In Germany it looks more like revolution every day. In Berlin

streets. G. Ermen, who came back on Friday, told me that he 
happened to engage in discussion about the war with some 
Prussian lieutenant on the Rhine Bridge at Coblenz, and the man 
had been very doubtful about the issue of the affair, admitted that 
both the men and the leadership of the Austrians were better than 
the Prussians', and when G. Ermen asked, 'What would happen if 
the Prussians were whacked?' he answered, 'Then we'll have a 
revolution.' Another philistine told me that he had heard from a 
reliable source in Cologne that the militia companies are being 
dispersed among the line, and that the militia regiments are being 
topped up with line; the order has apparently been given out. In 
any case, the army must be in such a state that a victory can only 
be expected if the Austrians move across the frontier first, and this 
time they seem to be flatly refusing to do so. But, for that same 
reason, the Prussians don't want to move either. This state of 
affairs may drag on for another week, until the situation is so 
tense that it breaks. 
There is a delightful historical irony being enacted through 
Bismarck's person. At the same moment that he utters liberal 
phrases he is forced to perform absolutist actions. In one and the 
same breath he will proclaim the German imperial constitution 
and suspend the Prussian constitution (the ordinances are already 
prepared).321 Good idea to try and play the Bonaparte against 
the bourgeoisie with the Junkers behind one instead of the peas­
ants! 
The militia will be just as much of a danger to the Prussians in 
this war as the Poles were in 1806,343 who also comprised over Vs 
of the army and threw the whole show into disorder before the 
battle. Only instead of disbanding, the militia will rebel after the 
defeat. 
The whole left bank of the Rhine has been denuded of troops, 
there are only 2 militia regiments stationed in Luxemburg, and 
they say the fortress is already being secretly evacuated; in 
Saarlouis there is merely a militia battalion that is not yet up to 
strength. Von der Heydt is to arrange the Saarbrücken coal-mine 
and State Railway deal via Oppenheim to raise money, and the 
Westphalian State Railway is to be sold to the Bergisch-Märkische 
Railway. The bonds for its Cologne-Minden shares 237 have been 
advanced to the state by the Bank of Prussia, which was the sole 
purpose of the affair. In all this the Berlin bankers are all working 
hand in glove with the government. 
I think that in a fortnight the storm will break in Prussia. If this 
opportunity passes without being used, and if the people allow

DEAR FRED, 
This damned weather is having a particularly evil effect sur mon

coming to Manchester, as I cannot leave the house in my PRESENT

FRENCH FRIENDS have already used my absence once in these TRYING 
CIRCUMSTANCES to execute some tomfoolery in the name of the

As regards newspapers here, in my view the best thing to do, if 
nothing comes of the Manchester business, is to send a proper 
MILITARY ARTICLE to The Times, to which you can present yourself as 
the English correspondent of the Darmstadt Militär-Zeitung}' No 
need for any political considerations, as one London paper is just

You must now keep me 'critically' au courant des affaires in ITALY 
and GERMANY. 
There was a debate at yesterday's meeting of the INTERNATIONAL 
COUNCIL about the present war. It was announced beforehand and 
our ROOM was very full. Even the Italian gentlemen had honoured 
us with their presence again. The discussion  WAS  WOUND  UP, as could 
have been foreseen, with the 'QUESTION  OF NATIONALITY' in general and 
the attitude we should adopt to it. This sujet adjourned until next 
Tuesday. 346 
The French, very strongly represented,  GAVE  VENT to their cordial 
dislike for the Italians. 
The representatives of 'jeune France' 3 (non-workers), by the way, 
trotted out their view that any nationality and even nations are 'des 
préjugés surannés'^ Proudhonised Stirnerianism. Everything to be 
broken down into small 'groupes' or 'communes', which in turn form 
an 'association', but not a state. Furthermore, this 'individualisa­
tion' of mankind and the 'mutualisme' M1 it entails are to proceed by 
bringing history to a halt in every other country and the whole 
world waits until the French are ready to carry out a social 
revolution. Then they will demonstrate the experiment to us, and 
the rest of the world, being bowled over by the force of their 
example, will do the same. Just what Fourier expected from his 
phalanstère modèle. D'ailleurs," everyone who clutters up the 'social' 
question with the 'superstitions' of the Old World is a 'reactionary'. 
The English laughed heartily when I began my SPEECH with the 
observation that our friend Lafargue, and others, who had 
abolished nationalities, had addressed us in 'French', i.e., in a 
language which 9/ln of the audience did not understand. I went on 
to suggest that by his denial of nationalities he seemed quite 
unconsciously to imply their absorption by the model French 
nation. 
For the rest, the position is difficult now because one must 
equally oppose the silly Italianism of the English, on the one hand, 
and the mistaken polemic against it of the French, on the other, 
and above all prevent any demonstration which would involve our 
Association in a one-sided course.

Dear Moor, 
The other half of the note enclosed. Unfortunately, your 
telegram reached me after 12  o'clock? 6 so that I could not make use 
of the first post. 
What do you say to the Prussians? Their initial successes were 
exploited with enormous vigour, and, if it had not been for this 
intensity, Benedek would probably have quietly withdrawn to 
Olmütz, 3 but he was obviously forced to come to battle yesterday, 
and there could be no doubt about the issue after what had 
befallen. To determine the outcome of such a decisive battle in 8 
hours is quite unprecedented; in other circumstances, it would 
have lasted 2 days. 348 But the needle-gun is a merciless weapon, 
and then these fellows really do fight with a verve that I have 
never before observed in such peace-time troops. For the 
defender, the attacker's need to take positions by storm compen­
sates for his superiority in weapons, and here too the Prussians 
appear to have accomplished a great deal. Benedek, with his deep 
'plan', turns out to have been not merely a jackass but a dullard as 
well. How splendidly he could, with sufficient men, have caught 
those fellows in the mountains! 
At all events, Bismarck will now try to set up his Imperial 
Germany, and that should include Bohemia, which he hopes to 
take from the Austrians and thereby establish a link between 
Silesia and Bavaria. In the treaty with Italy, he did after all 
stipulate 'un territoire autrichien équivalent à la Vénéti'. hi2S 
Berlin is again acting with the vileness for which it is famed and 
yesterday even went so far as to elect a whole load of ministers. 
What will those camels of men of Progress" say now? 
The farce up in the North-West is delightful and will probably 
soon be no less so in the South, too. 
The only safeguard against the betrayal that Bismarck has 
plotted with Bonaparte is the quite unexpected magnitude of the 
a Czech name: Olomouc - b 'Austrian territory equivalent to Venetia'

Yet, I was unable to pay the LANDLORD, who is again owed for two 
quarters. I had to allow priority to part-payments to the fellows 
who are dunning me every hour of the day. 
As regards my state of health, first of all, I have had my nose 
properly to the grindstone again over the past two weeks, and hope 
that by the end of August, if I preserve this degree of health, I 
shall have finished the first volume,b which I am having published 
by itself.  It is true that I am obliged to continue with Gumpert's 
liver-medicine every day, as I would otherwise be laid low at once. 
Question: is the arsenic (put aside for many weeks now) compatible 
with it? I am asking because for 4 days now another carbuncle has 
been appearing above my right collar-bone. I owe more to the 
Bordeaux than to any medicine. I am incidentally only working in 
the day-time, as a sporadic attempt to work at night (once or twice) 
immediately had very unfortunate consequences. 
Before passing to general matters, can you translate 'PUT STRETCHES

Beside a great Prussian defeat, which perhaps (oh but those 
Berliners!) might have led to a revolution, there could have been 
no better outcome than their stupendous victory. Thiers had been 
so successful in denouncing Bonaparte's policy of helping to 
'make' Prussia (for beside the English, your Frenchman in fact 
really hates only the Prussians), that Boustrapa 76 had to amend the 
constitution he had imposed on the French and 'abolish' discussion 
of the address par ordre du c Moniteur. (I am enclosing J. Favre's 
speech on Mexico and Glais-Bizoin's bad witticisms for you, so that 
you can see what Boustrapa's position was before the outbreak of 
war.) 351 Mr Bonaparte was counting on victory and defeat 
swinging back and forth between Prussians and Austrians, so that 
eventually he would be able to step in between the exhausted 
combatants like Jupiter Scapin.d The Prussians' success really puts 
his regime in France in dire peril (it is his second great 
miscalculation since the American Civil War) if he does not 
manage to dictate the terms of peace. On the other hand, the 
same success (we are not back in 1815 now) makes it impossible, 
almost impossible, for the Prussian dynasty to accept terms other 
than those which Austria must reject, not to mention the fact that 
handsome William,6 alias Alexander the Great, cannot possibly 
cede German territory to France. The Prussians' decision will

what he will do, as that would require one to be in possession of 
the material in the Russian State Chancellory. But I, for my part, 
cannot understand how the Russians, who are furthermore 
offended that the Austrians refused their help, can permit Austria 
to get her breath back and miss this favourable moment for their 
Turco-Danubian manoeuvres. Mr Victor Emmanuel is also in a 
pretty pickle. Venice now belongs to Bonaparte. If he accepts it 
from him as a present, that will be the end for his dynasty. On the

attack Austria?352

Naturally, Bonaparte does not want war now, until he has 
introduced the NEEDLE-GUN or an equivalent. A  YANKEE* 1 has offered 
the war ministry here a rifle which, so I am assured by a REFUGEE 
Prussian officer (Wilke), is as superior to the needle-gun as the 
latter is to 'OLD BESS',354 by virtue of its extreme simplicity of 
design, non-susceptibility to heating, reduced need for cleaning, 
and cheapness. Is there any sphere in which our theory that the 
organisation of labour is determined by the means of production is 
more dazzlingly vindicated than in the industry for human 
slaughter? It really would be worth your while to write something

Dear Moor, 
History, i.e., world history, is becoming ever more ironical. What 
could be more splendid than that Bonaparte should be thus 
mocked in practice by his pupil Bismarck, who, backwoods junker 
as he is, has suddenly outgrown his master and all at once gives 
the whole world a tangible demonstration of how very much this 
arbitre de l'Europe exists ON SUFFERANCE. And then this Bismarck 
himself,  who, in order to be able to govern to all appearances 
feudally and absolutely for a few months at home, is pursuing the 
policy of the bourgeoisie WITH A VENGEANCE abroad, preparing the 
ground for the bourgeoisie to rule and striking along paths where 
progress is only possible by liberal, even revolutionary means, and, 
in so doing, making his own backwoods junkers be daily at 
variance with their own principles. The presenters of the 
ceremonial shield to Francis Bomba b are in alliance with Garibaldi, 
and the advocates of Thrones by the grace of God go swallowing 
up whole countries in spite of Victor Emmanuel! 3D5 Never has

these last 4 weeks, and the historico-feudal party, which cost the 
genius of Frederick William IV of blessed memory so much toil 
and trouble to found, is now choking on the filth which it is being 
forced to gobble up at its own leader's command. 
The simple fact is: Prussia has 500,000 needle-guns and the rest 
of the world not even 500. It is not possible to equip an army with 
breech-loaders in under 2, 3 or perhaps 5 years. Until then 
Prussia will be dux. Do you think Bismarck will not make use of 
such a moment? Certainly he will. Bonaparte will take very good 
care not to pick a quarrel, and as for the Russians, it is true they 
are setting up a most furious howl in the Journal de St.-Pétersbourg," 
but militarily they are now less to be feared than ever. I have no 
doubt at all that this sudden enormous growth of Prussia's might 
will drive Bonaparte and the Russians together, and that their first 
endeavour will be to prevent each and every increase in Prussia's 
might. But they will take care to hold back from war; as for 
France, if she were to intervene actively, that would assuredly be 
the best way to drive the South Germans properly into the arms of 
the Prussians and consign the civil war to oblivion. 356 And as for 
the Russians, Monsieur Bismarck is the man to threaten them with 
a new Polish insurrection, and they know that the fellow is 
unscrupulous enough for that. In general, Bismarck is only too 
well aware of his power and also knows that it can only maintain 
its present magnitude for a few years, and I believe he will exploit 
it to the very last drop. Moreover, Bonaparte can always be bought 
off with Belgium in the end, and only just before the war Goltz, 
Bonaparte and the Crown Prince of Holland b 'considered the 
possibility' of dividing Belgium between France and Holland, 
which would then cede Luxemburg to France.349 I believe the war 
is not over yet by a long chalk, and there is much that can still 
happen. 
The Russians really do seem to have realigned themselves 
towards Austria some time ago now, and this tremendous success 
of the Prussians will make it impossible for them to go back on it 
in any way. The more so since Austria will now be ready to receive 
Bosnia or Walachia in exchange for Venice, with Russia then 
taking Moldavia. 
You see, by the by, how right I was in my appraisal of the 
Prussian army when I repeatedly said there was far more to it 
than people were wont to admit. After these successes and after

the absolutely brilliant performance of the troops, they will be so

Dear Moor, 
I have written about your history to Gumpert, who is in Wales; 
as I do not know his address, the letter will first have to go to his 
home here, hence certainly some delay. As soon as I have a reply, 
I'll write to you, but meanwhile I should advise you to take arsenic 
at once and put off everything else, so as to stop the damned 
carbuncle. Put an end to this abomination at any cost. 
Bonaparte's little plan and his intervention are in part probably 
a consequence of an earlier agreement with Bismarck, but 
certainly also—the new Confederation of the Rhine, etc.—are 
threats in his direction. But how the fellow can be so stupid as to 
make this plan public is beyond my comprehension357: as with 
Schapper—that he could be so stupid, etc.— It will assuredly drive 
the whole of South Germany into the arms of the Prussians and 
even the old philistines at the Exchange here are quite beside

themselves about it. One old man from Frankfurt told me: it's 
worth more to the Prussians than a reinforcement of 100,000 
men. 
You see how the stupid South Germans are letting themselves 
be picked off one by one without even taking the trouble to close 
ranks. 356 It'll soon be the old, old story, we've been betrayed, we'll 
be led like lambs to the slaughter!a 1849 all over again. I feel sorry 
for the fellows, they're good soldiers. Only now does one 
understand how the French were able to score such successes 
against the 'Empire', but not how the Empire was able to hold out 
for so long against a concentrated monarchy like France.358 
I will try and produce the stuff about the mass-murder-industry 
for you.b 
Many regards.

DEAR FRED, 
The carbuncle has fortunately departed again of its own accord. 
But in the present heat my LIVER has been and still is scourging me 
sorely. For all that, my workd is progressing well and will continue 
to do so if my present condition lasts. It is, of course, 
embarrassing for me to have to pester you again already, but as 
you will gather from the enclosed note (which you must return to 
me) there is periculum in mora.* I have with difficulty obtained an

in doubt as to whether you are in Manchester. Nor have I received 
any more copies of The Manchester Guardian. Or has nothing else 
of yours appeared in  it?345 
One must refrain from passing any judgment on the present 
circumstances, pending news either of a ceasefire or of a decisive 
battle at Vienna. At any rate, the course of events has demonstrated 
the extraordinary decay of the Austrian system. 
For the moment, these English of ours are, as always, paying 
homage to success. The great Arnold Ruge, too, has made his 
pronunciamento for Prussia 14 days ago, as the great Kinkel did 
earlier still. If the Prussians continue victorious to the end, what a 
throng of place-seekers and fatherland-rescuers will surge towards 
Frankfurt! 
At all events, the 'homme prestige', 3 'Jupiter Scapin', b GROTESQUE 
PROVIDENCE  or EUROPE is shaken and even overshadowed by Bismarck. 
That is some consolation. 
The VTH REPORT of the CHILDREN'S EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION  appeared 
here a few days ago. It concludes the enquête c into the 
manufactories, and only a supplement has yet to appear concern­
ing the 'ORGANISED GANGS' of women and children, who are 
sporadically used in agriculture. There could have been no more 
dreadful blow to the optimism of the bourgeoisie since 1850 than 
from these 5 BLUE BOOKS. Furthermore, the Vlllth REPORT of the 
BOARD  OF HEALTH d was brought out a few days ago, which contains 
in particular a very detailed enquête of the living conditions of the 
proletariat. 359

Dear Moor, 
I think you will now have received the notes all right; in a 
moment of distraction I must have put in, in their stead, the piece 
of paper on which I had noted the Nos. The notes themselves I 
had slipped inside the cover of my writing-case, which is where I 
found them when I had recovered from the initial shock of your 
telegram. 46 I hope they still arrived in time. 
The business in Germany now seems fairly straightforward to 
me. From the moment of Bismarck's so colossal success in using 
the Prussian army to put the bourgeois plan for Little Germany 
into effect,3b0 developments in Germany have moved so decisively 
in that direction that we shall have to accept the fait accompli just 
like everybody else, WE MAY LIKE IT OR NOT. AS regards the national 
aspect of the question, at all events, Bismarck will set up a Little 
German Empire of the dimensions envisaged by the bourgeoisie, 
i. e., including South-West Germany, the phrases about the Main 
boundary  and the OPTIONAL SOUTH GERMAN SEPARATE CONFEDERACY, at any 
rate,  only being intended for the French367; meanwhile the 
Prussians are marching on Stuttgart. Incidentally, before very 
long, the German provinces of Austria will join this Empire too, 
since Austria is certain to go Hungarian now,293 and the Germans 
will become the 3rd nation in the Empire—lower even than the 
Slavs. 
Politice" Bismarck will be forced to rely on the bourgeoisie, 
whom he needs against the Imperial Princes. Perhaps not at this 
moment, as his prestige and the army are still sufficient. But 
simply to ensure that parliament will grant the necessary 
conditions for central power, he will have to give something to the 
bourgeoisie, and the natural course of events will constantly 
compel him or his successors to appeal to the bourgeoisie again; so 
that, even if Bismarck perhaps gives the bourgeoisie no more than 
he absolutely has to now, he will, nevertheless, be driven 
increasingly in a bourgeois direction. 
Politically

The good aspect to the affair is that it simplifies the situation 
and makes revolution easier by putting an end to the brawling 
among the smaller capitals and, at all events, hastens develop­
ments. A German parliament is after all quite a different thing 
from a Prussian Chamber. All the little states will be drawn into 
the movement, there will be an end to the worst localised 
tendencies, and the parties will at last become truly national 
instead of merely local. 
The chief disadvantage—and it is a very substantial one—is the 
inevitable swamping of Germany by Prussianism. Also the 
temporary exclusion of German Austria, a consequence of which 
will be an immediate advance of the Slav cause in Bohemia, 
Moravia and Carinthia. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to 
prevent either. 
In my view, therefore, we can do nothing whatsoever but simply 
accept the fact, without approving of it, and use, as far as we can, 
the increased opportunities which are, at all events, bound to arise 
now, to organise and unite the German proletariat nationally. 
I did not need Stumpfs letter to tell me that BROTHER Liebknecht 
would launch himself into fanatical support of the Austrian cause, 
it was absolutely inevitable. 31'1 Incidentally, there was no mistaking 
his furious despatches from Leipzig in the Neue Frankfurter 
Zeitung. This N. F. Zeitung, with its Blind-ish regicidal tendencies, 
went so far as to reproach the Prussians for their disgraceful 
treatment of 'His Highness the Elector of Hesse'" and was beside 
itself with enthusiasm for the poor blind Guelph. b 
Nothing more of mine in the Guardian.34"

[London,] 27 July 11 1866 
Dear FRED, 
Best thanks for the £10. They came in the nick of time. 
I have not written to  Stumpf,  precisely because he asked for a 
line of 'conduct', and my view was that he would do best not to 
'conduct' himself at all until events took a decisive turn. 361 That 
was a view which I RATHER thought advisable not to put to him in 
writing. Mainz is at present still encircled, so far as I know, so 
postal communication is also presumably interrupted. Did you 
write to Stumpf? 
The comedy in Frankfurt makes up somewhat for the exhala­
tion of the victors. Lord, lord, they howled, 25 million! And his 
worship the mayor1' goes and hangs  himself!362  And the Prussians, 
for their part, officially declare that Frankfurt will have to fork 
out because its papers have 'insulted' His Majesty William the 
Conqueror.' Since his government post in Brunn is only tempor­
ary, Stieber will eventually become mayor of the Frankfurter-on-
Mainers, whom by the way I have always thought the most 
insufferable scoundrels. And Edgar Bauer will be imposed on 
them as Censor-in-Chief. But as regards the Eschenheimer Gasse, 3"3 
Privy Counsellor Duncker would—except that he is, of course, 
ruling in Kassel. 
I am entirely at one with you that we must take the mess as it is. 
It is, nevertheless, pleasant to be far off at this youthful time of 
love's first dawning.d The arrogance of the Prussians and the 
foolishness of handsome William,e who believes that nothing has 
changed since his dream of victory, except that he is now a great 
potentate, etc., will have their effect soon enough. The Austrians 
now find themselves where the Slav fanatics from Prague wanted 
them in 1848.3M However, for the moment their loss of Venice, 
their enforced concentration of strength is in no way to the 
Russians' advantage. Being a Pan-Slavic empire themselves, they

will be all the more antagonistic to the Muscovites. In view of the 
extraordinary decline of the Habsburgs, it is certainly to be feared 
that  BY and  BY they will allow the Russians to tempt them into a 
combined attack on Turkey. 
For the workers, of course, everything that centralises the 
bourgeoisie is to their advantage. At all events, even if peace is 
concluded tomorrow, it will be even more provisional than that of 
Villafranca and Zurich was.305 As soon as the 'arms reform' has 
been completed by the various parties, it will be back to 'bashing', 
as Schapper calls it. At all events, Bonaparte has suffered a 
setback, too, although the setting up of military kingdoms on all 
sides right and left fits the Plon-Plonist93  scheme 'de la démocratie 
générale'." 
The government has almost caused a mutiny here. Your 
Englishman first needs a revolutionary education, of course, for 
which two weeks would suffice if Sir Richard Mayne had absolute 
powers of command. In actual fact, it all hung on one point. If the 
RAILINGS had been used—and it almost came to that—for offence 
and defence against the police, and some score of the latter killed, 
the military would have had to 'step in', instead of merely 
parading. And then things would have got quite jolly. This much 
is certain: that these stiff-necked John Bulls, whose sconces appear 
made to measure for the constables' BLUDGEONS, will accomplish 
nothing without a really bloody clash with those in power. 
A touching scene, that, between that old jackass Beales and the 
equally asinine old Walpole, and then the intervention of the 
thin-voiced, INTRUSIVE, self-important Holyoake, who through 'love 
of the truth' is constantly finding his way into The Times—nothing 
but peace and dissoluteness.306 Meanwhile, whilst these riff-raff are 
patting each other on the back and belick-spittling each other, that 
cur Knox, the police magistrate of Marylebone, is sending people 
down in a summary fashion, which shows what would happen if 
London were Jamaica.252 
Disraeli has made a fine fool of  himself,  firstly by his pathetic 
remark in the Lower House,b 'he did not know whether he still 
had a house', and then by the strong military occupation of that 
same house, although, thirdly, the  MOB  (instructed beforehand by 
the REFORM LEAGUE people) deliberately left the house of Mr 'Vivian 
Grey'c UNTOUCHED. The house lost not a hair from its head. For 
which ' Elcho's window-panes had to suffer the more. I had

appropriate to pay a visit to the 'Times'  NEWSPAPER.  AS they did not 
immediately 'take' the HINT, or did not want to, I did not press it.

with the utmost gravity, and Dr Hunter's report, in the Vlllth

Dear Moor, 
The humour in your last letter leads me to conclude that your 
liver must be much better, although you do not say anything about 
it yourself.  As regards the Frankfurters,362 you should have just 
heard the wailing and gnashing of teeth by the ones here, of 
whom we have a whole legion here and who got the most frightful 
letters from their brothers, etc. On this occasion the Prussian 
lieutenant did, of course, conduct himself with all the charm for 
which he is renowned, but it was to be expected from the 
beginning that these gentlemen would be  MORE  FRIGHTENED THAN HURT.

positive pleasure that it was they who were treated so roughly. I 
have seen such letters  myself. 
So, Bismarck won in the end, and Wilhelmchen 3 has issued a 
form of words to conciliate his Highnesses, Noble Lords and 
Faithful Followers, simultaneously affirming, however, that if they 
refuse him money again, the spending of money without approval 
will unfortunately be 'unavoidable' again. I still do not see how the 
conflict can thereby be resolved, even with this Chamber. Then 
there is a German, or RATHER North German parliament as well, 
about whose possible position or at least powers Mr Eulenburg has 
resolutely refused to give any information whatsoever—there are 
splendid prospects for a dust-up before long. Bismarck himself 
will surely seek to avoid a dispute, he is not that stupid, but that 
old brute of a Hohenzollern is bound to embroil  himself,  and then 
he will be amazed at the intelligence of his bayonets. 367 
That we shall soon be back to bashing is clear enough. I believe 
things will come to a head with the French. Bonaparte is shrewd 
enough to want to avoid this as long as at all possible, but the mass 
of Frenchmen, in particular the bourgeoisie, with their distaste for 
any strengthening of Germany, really is too short-sighted and 
fanatical to be denied the expansion de la France qui ne peut avoir 
lieu que du côté de l'Allemagne, h and war against Prussia is also 
popular with the peasants and more stupid workers; therefore 
there is no telling how soon the storm will break. 
Wehner, who has just returned from Hanover, tells me that the 
Prussian officers have already made themselves thoroughly hated 
there, too, likewise the bureaucrats and police. 
I shall probably not spend long in Germany this year either. 
What with the exhalation of the victors in the North and the 
Republicans bawling out their enthusiasm for the Elector of 
Hessec  in the South, where ought one to go? I shall attempt to go 
into the Harz by a roundabout route, there are fortunately no 
garrisons there. 
The Kölnische Zeitung is now screaming with much frothing at 
the mouth for the exclusion of South Germany. This is the 
catchword put out by Bismarck to facilitate Bonaparte's retreat, 
and the Kölnische is storming in this direction with such insane 
fervour that one sees through the whole nonsense immediately.

most vociferously shouting for peace, it leapt into the contrary

stance as soon as it saw that Bismarck with his cry of 'Austria 
wants war! Up and at 'em!' was not to be put off the scent, and 
ever since it has been Bismarck's best friend, at least in good will if 
not in finesse. It is his lap-dog in the press. 
If the new breech-loading gun the American showed to the 
government here is the Snider-Enfield, it is not up to much. It was 
most probably another one you were referring to.a Incidentally, a 
more rapid rate of fire than that already achieved by the 
needle-gun is of little consequence, as in practice the difference is 
virtually reduced to zero; on the other hand, greater precision and 
accuracy of aim are now becoming increasingly important. I am 
just re-reading Griesheim's tacticsb—how outdated almost all of it 
already is now!

Dear FRED, 
You inferred correctly from my last letter that my state of 
health has improved, although it fluctuates from one day to the 
next. Meanwhile, the feeling of being fit to work again DOES MUCH 
FOR A MAN. Unfortunately, I am constantly interrupted by SOCIAL 
TROUBLES and lose a lot of time. Thus, for example, the butcher has 
suspended meat supplies today, and by Saturday even my stock of 
paper will be used up. 
Since yesterday Laura is half promised to Monsieur Lafargue, 
my medical Creole. She treats him like the others, but the

outbursts of feeling these Creoles are subject to, a slight fear that 
the jeune homme'' (he is 25) might do away with  himself,  etc., some 
fondness for him, undemonstrative as always with Laura (he is a 
good-looking, intelligent, energetic lad of athletic build), have more 
or less led to a semi-compromise. The boy attached himself to me 
first of all, but soon transferred the ATTRACTION from the old man 
to his daughter. His economic circumstances are middling, as he is 
the only child of a former planter-family. b He is rayé de l'université 
de Paris pour deux ans, c on account of the congrès à Liège, 269 but 
intends to sit his examination at Strasbourg. In my judgment, he 
has an outstanding gift for medicine, in which he is, however, 
infinitely more sceptical than our friend Gumpert. Scepticism in 
medical matters appears to be the order of the day with both 
professors and students in Paris. E. g., Magendie, who declares all 
therapeutics, in their present STATE, to be fraudulent. As always, 
this scepticism not only does not exclude CROTCHETS, but embraces 
them. E. g., Lafargue believes in alcohol and electricity as the chief 
cures.  Fortunately, he is having a good adviser in Professor 
Carrère, a refugee (hautes mathématiques, 6 physics and chemistry), 
and will be able to acquire much practical experience in the 
London hospitals. I have managed to get him admitted there 
through the good offices of a third party. 
A very important work which I shall send on to you (but on 
condition that you send it back, as it is not my property) as soon as 
I have made the necessary notes, is: 'P. Trémaux, Origine et 
Transformations de l'Homme et des autres Etres, Paris 1865.' In spite 
of all the shortcomings that I have noted, it represents a very 
significant advance over Darwin. The two chief theses are: 
croisements* do not produce, as is commonly thought, variety, but, 
on the contrary, a unity typical of the espèces. 1 The physical 
features of the earth, on the other hand, differentiate (they are the 
chief,  though not the only basis). Progress, which Darwin regards 
as purely accidental, is essential here on the basis of the stages of 
the earth's development, dégénérescence? which Darwin cannot 
explain, is straightforward here; ditto the rapid extinction of 
merely transitional forms, compared with the slow development of 
the type of the espèce, so that the gaps in palaeontology, which 
Darwin finds disturbing, are necessary here. Ditto the fixity of the 
espèce, once established, which is explained as a necessary law

(apart from individual, etc., variations). Here hybridisation, which 
raises problems for Darwin, on the contrary supports the system, 
as it is shown that an espèce is in fact first established as soon as 
croisement with others ceases to produce offspring or to be 
possible, etc. 
In its historical and political applications far more significant 
and pregnant than Darwin. For certain questions, such as 
nationality, etc., only here has a basis in nature been found. E.g., 
he corrects the Pole Duchinski, whose version of the geological 
differences between Russia and the Western Slav lands he does 
incidentally confirm, by saying not that the Russians are Tartars 
rather than Slavs, etc.," as the latter believes, but that on the 
surface-formation predominant in Russia the Slav has been 
tartarised and mongolised; likewise (he spent a long time in 
Africa) he shows that the common negro type is only a 
degeneration of a far higher one.

Dear Moor, 
I don't know whether I should offer full, semi- or no 
congratulations at all on Laura's semi-engagement. But whatever 
quantity of congratulations may be admissible, it affects their 
quality not a wit, and I therefore congratulate with all my heart. 
About how much does the Trémaux book" cost? If it is not 
excessively dear on account of illustrations or anything, I'll get it 
myself,  and then you won't need to send it to me. 
To allay your butcher's wrath and replenish your stock of paper, 
I am enclosing J/F 65865 and 66, 2 £5 notes totalling £10, dated 
Manchester, 30 January 1865. I wish that I could set aside more 
than £200 a year for you, but unfortunately I cannot. If all goes 
well, it is true that I shall probably be able to provide another £50, 
but cotton is falling again now, and Bonaparte's note concerning 
the 1814 frontiers369 is alarming the philistine, and that affects the 
accounts. 
That note of Bonaparte's seems to indicate that a HITCH has 
cropped up between him and Bismarck. Otherwise, his demand 
would surely not have been so discourteous and unexpected, nor 
would it have been made at such a very inopportune moment for 
Bismarck. Bismarck undoubtedly stands to lose nothing by 
complying with it, but how can he do so now? What will his 
victorious army say to it? And the German parliament, and the 
Chambers, and the South Germans? And the old jackass,b who will 
now look as idiotically beatific as my black and white dog Dido 
when he's eaten his belly full, and who has said, not an inch of 
German soil, etc.? 
The note was a great folly on Bonaparte's part, but the howling 
of the opposition and probably of the army, too, will presumably 
have forced him to precipitate the matter. It may turn out to be 
exceedingly dangerous for him. Either Bismarck enables a 
concession to be made, and then he will be forced to start a war 
with Bonaparte at the earliest opportunity in order to take his

revenge; or else he may not give way, and then there will be war 
even sooner. In either case, Bonaparte runs the risk of fighting a 
war he does not want and without the appropriate diplomatic 
preparation, without any sure allies, for the publicly avowed 
purpose of conquest. Incidentally, Bismarck told the Hanoverian 
minister Platen several years ago that he would put Germany 
under the Prussian helmet and then lead it against the French in 
order to 'forge it into one'.370

MARX TO PAUL LAFARGUE371 
IN LONDON 
London, 13 August 1866 
My dear Lafargue, 
Allow me to make the following observations: 
1. If you wish to continue your relations with my daughter,3 you 
will have to give up your present manner of 'courting'. You know 
full well that no engagement has been entered into, that as yet 
everything is undecided. And even if she were formally betrothed 
to you, you should not forget that this is a matter of long 
duration. The practice of excessive intimacy is especially inapprop­
riate since the two lovers will be living at the same place for a 
necessarily prolonged period of severe testing and purgatory. I

have observed with alarm how your conduct has altered from one 
day to the next within the geological period of one single week. 
To my mind, true love expresses itself in reticence, modesty and 
even the shyness of the lover towards the object of his veneration, 
and certainly not in giving free rein to one's passion and in 
premature demonstrations of familiarity. If you should urge your 
Creole temperament in your defence, it is my duty to interpose 
my sound reason between your temperament and my daughter. If 
in her presence you are incapable of loving in a manner in 
keeping with the London latitude, you will have to resign yourself 
to loving her from a distance. I am sure you will take the hint. 
2. Before your relationship with Laura is finally settled, I must 
have proper clarification of your financial position. My daughter 
believes that I am conversant with your affairs. She is mistaken. I 
did not raise this question because I believed it was incumbent 
upon you to take the initiative. You know that I have sacrificed my 
whole fortune to the revolutionary struggle. I do not regret it. 
Quite the contrary. If I had to begin my life over again, I would 
do the same. I would not marry, however. As far as it lies within 
my power, I wish to save my daughter from the reefs on which 
her mother's life was wrecked. Had it not been for my direct 
intervention (a weakness on my part) and the influence that my 
friendship for you exerted on my daughter's conduct, this affair 
would never have progressed to its present point; for this reason I 
bear a heavy personal responsibility. As far as your immediate 
situation is concerned, the information which has come my way, 
although I did not seek it, is by no means reassuring. But let's not 
deal with that now. Regarding your position in general, I know 
that you are still a student, that your career in France has been 
half ruined by the events at Liège, 269 that you still lack an 
indispensable tool for your acclimatisation in England, the 
language, and that your prospects are at best entirely problematic. 
Observation has persuaded me that you are not very industrious 
by nature, despite spasmodic feverish activity and good intentions. 
In these circumstances, you will need external support if you are 
to set out in life with my daughter. I know nothing of your family. 
Although they may enjoy a comfortable living, that does not in 
itself mean that they would be disposed to make sacrifices for you. 
I do not even know with what favour they regard your proposed 
alliance. I repeat that I must have positive clarification on all these 
matters. Moreover, as an avowed realist, you cannot, of course, 
expect that I should behave as an idealist in respect of my 
daughter's future. Such a positive person as  yourself,  who would

abolish poetry, will not wish to make poetry to the detriment of 
my child. 
3. To preclude any misinterpretation of this letter, I would like 
to state that—were you in a position to enter into matrimony 
today—it would not come about. My daughter would refuse. I 
myself should object. You must have achieved something in life 
before thinking of marriage, and a long period of testing is 
required of you and of Laura. 
4. I would like this letter to remain confidential between 
ourselves. I await your reply. 
Yours very truly

DEAR FRED, 
Lenchenb reached the post-office too late on Saturday to send 
off my note gratefully acknowledging receipt of the £10. 
You must forgive me if I do not write a letter today. I have the 
most pressing business on my back. I wrote a long letter in French 
to Laiargue today, telling him that I must have des renseignements 
positifs 1' from his family concerning his economic circumstances 
before the affair can proceed or an  ARRANGEMENT  can be arrived at. d

DEAR FRED, 
Just a few lines today. The Lafargue affair has been arranged 
inasmuch as his old mand has written to me from Bordeaux, 
requesting the title of promesso sposoe  for his son and offering a 
very favourable economic settlement. Furthermore, it is accepted 
that Lafargue jeune 1 first has to qualify as a doctor in London and 
then in Paris before thinking of marriage. So  FAR  THE  THING  is SETTLED. 
But I also informed our Creole yesterday that if he cannot calm 
himself DOWN to English manners, Laura will show him the door 
without more ado. He must be absolutely clear about this or 
nothing will come of the affair. He has a heart of gold but is an 
enfant gâté g and too much a child of nature.

IN HANOVER 
London, 23 August 1866 
My dear Friend, 
You must justifiably be angered by my prolonged silence, 
despite your sundry friendly communications. 
However, you will have to excuse me, on account of the 
extraordinary circumstances in which I find  myself. 
In consequence of my long illness, my economic situation has 
reached a point of crisis. I have accumulated debts, which are a 
crushing mental burden and make me incapable of any activity 
other than the work in which I am immersed. If I do not succeed 
in taking out a loan of at least 1,000 talers at an interest of say 5%, 
I can really see no way out. And despite the numerous letters of 
acknowledgement I receive from Germany, I do not know where 
to turn. I can only accept aid from personal friends, nothing 
public. You will understand that in such conditions letter-writing 
becomes difficult. 
I have not yet succeeded in re-establishing my former lucrative 
links with America.374 They are so taken up with their own

movement there that they regard any expenditure on European 
reports as faux frais de production 3 I could help them by emigrating 
myself.  But I consider it my duty to remain in Europe and 
complete the work on which I have been engaged for so many 
years. b 
As regards that work  itself,  I do not think I shall be able to 
deliver the manuscript of the first volume (it has now grown to 3 
volumes227) to Hamburg before October. I can only work 
productively for a very few hours per day without immediately 
feeling the effects physically, and for my family's sake I suppose I 
must, however unwillingly, resolve to observe the hygienic limits 
until I am fully recovered. My work is furthermore often 
interrupted by the impingement of adverse external cir­
cumstances. 
Although I am devoting much time to the preparations for the 
congress in Geneva,375  I cannot go  myself,  nor do I wish to, 
because my work cannot be subjected to prolonged interruption. I 
consider that what I am doing through this work is far more 
important for the working class than anything I might be able to 
do personally at any congrès quelconque. 0 
I regard the international situation in Europe as only tempor­
ary. As regards Germany in particular, we must take things as we 
find them,376 i.e., promote the interests of revolution in a manner 
appropriate to the changed conditions. As  TO PRUSSIA, it is now more 
important than ever TO WATCH  AND  TO DENOUNCE  her  RELATIONS  TO RUSSIA.

Dear Becker, 
It is absolutely imperative that Jung be made President of the 
congress,3'5 
1. because he speaks the 3 languages, English, French, and 
German. 
2. Jung truly represents the  CENTRAL COUNCIL,  Odger (who further­
more only knows his mother-tongue) was not elected by the 
CENTRAL COUNCIL;  we elected 4 delegates, with Jung at the head; 
Odger was only to go if he could raise the money himself 
(guaranteed by us, of course). He has done nothing for the 
Association. 
3. Cremer and Odger have hatched a very mean plot to prevent 
Jung and Eccarius leaving on the very last day. 
4. Odger wishes to be elected President of the congress as a means 
of impressing the English and imposing himself as President of 
the CENTRAL COUNCIL  for next year, against the wish of the great 
majority  of the  COUNCIL. 
5. Cremer and Odger have both betrayed us in the Reform 
League, where they came to a compromise with the bourgeoisie 
against our wishes.315 
6. Mr Cremer has morally debased himself completely. All his 
efforts are now aimed at securing a  'paid''  post for  himself,  so that 
he need not work. In no circumstances must he therefore be elected 
as General Secretary by the congress. (The only paid post.) They

General Secretary must know more than one language. 
9.1' The President of  the  CENTRAL COUNCIL must not be elected by the 
congress but here in London, as a figure of merely local importance. 
10. At the election of the President for the  congress,  you must say 
at the outset that an international congress can only be presided 
over by a man who can speak the various languages, simply to save 
time,  etc.

while smoking, he is in the habit of inundating the chimney with.

By way of demonstration against the French monsieurs—who 
wanted to exclude everyone except 'travailleurs manuels', >l in the 
first instance from membership of the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION, or 
at least from eligibility for election as delegate to the congress— 
the English yesterday proposed me as President of the  CENTRAL 
COUNCIL. I declared that under no circumstances could I accept 
such a thing, and proposed Odger in my turn, who was then in 
fact re-elected, although some people voted for me despite my 
declaration. Dupont, incidentally, has given me the key to the 
Tolain and Fribourg operation. They want to stand as workers' 
candidates for the Corps  législatif 4 in 1869, on the 'principle' that 
only workers can represent the workers. That is why it was 
exceedingly important for these gentlemen to get this principle 
proclaimed through the Congress. 380 
At yesterday's meeting of the CENTRAL COUNCIL there were all 
manner of dramatic scenes. E.g., Mr Cremer fell to earth with a 
bump when Fox was appointed General Secretary in his stead. He 
controlled his fury only with great difficulty. Another scene when 
Mr Le Lubez had to be officially informed of his expulsion from 
the CENTRAL COUNCIL par  décret 1' of the congress. He gave vent to the 
turmoil in his breast in an hour-long speech, in which he spat fire 
and brimstone at the Parisians, represented himself in terms of 
astonishing self-esteem and mumbled all manner of dubious things 
about intrigues whereby the nationalities who were well-disposed 
towards him (Belgium and Italy) were prevented from attending 
the congress. Finally, he demanded a vote of confidence from the 
Central Council' 81—and this will be discussed next Tuesday.

[London,] 1 October 1866 
Dear Engels, 
I do not know whether I told you last time I wrote that there is 
a bill of exchange (no longer in the LANDLORD'S hands) outstanding 
against me for the rent. Sawyer had written that the bill was due 
on the 2nd inst., i.e., tomorrow. I called on him yesterday, as by 
my reckoning the thing could not be due until 3 October, as I had 
drawn the bill on 1 July for 3 MONTHS, so that 3 days sight must be 
added. And it turned out I was right. The amount is £46 (3 
QUARTERS), and I have been sans sou" for many weeks, since the SMALL 
SUMS,  which were still obtainable via pawnbrokers, dried up. 
As I am furthermore now HARD PRESSED from the daily 'supplies' 
which have once more accumulated in recent months and in 
present circumstances (Lafargue) must avoid any éclat h more than 
ever, I would leave for the Continent at once to see what I can 
arrange there 'personally'. However, I must defer that until my 
manuscript' is completed, so that I can take it with me and am not 
subjected to fresh interruption.

ENGELS TO MARX

Manchester, 2 October 1866 
Dear Moor, 
You did not tell me that you had signed a bill for £46, which 
was why I sent you half notes for only £40 yesterday; the missing 
halves follow today, as well as a further five-pound-note 
I/F 98815, Manchester, 30 January 1865. 
Our cashier has not got a second five-pound-note, and it's too 
late for a POST OFFICE order, so I cannot include the remaining 
SOVEREIGN; but you will no doubt surmount that difficulty. 
Regarding Moilin3  and Trémaux, b I will write at greater length 
in the next few days; I have not quite finished reading the latter 
yet, but I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing to his 
whole theory because he knows nothing of geology, and is 
incapable of even the most common-or-garden literary-historical 
critique. That stuff about the NIGGER Santa Maria and the whites 
turning into Negroes is enough to make one die of laughing. 382 
Especially the idea that the traditions of the Senegal NIGGERS 
necessarily deserve credence, just because these fellows cannot write] 
In addition, it is another pretty notion of his to ascribe the 
differences between a Basque, a Frenchman, a Breton, and an 
Alsatian to the surface-structure, which is, of course, also to blame 
for the people speaking four different languages. 
Perhaps the man will demonstrate in the 2nd volume how he 
explains that we Rhinelanders on our Devonian transitional massif 
(which has not been covered again by the sea since long before the 
coal was formed) did not become idiots and NIGGERS ages ago, or 
else he will assert that we are really NIGGERS. 
The book is utterly worthless, pure theorising in defiance of all 
the facts, and for each piece of evidence it cites it should itself first 
provide evidence in turn.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 October 1866 
Dear Engels, 
The enclosed bill will give you some idea of what adventures I 
have had today and yesterday. It was not yesterday that it became 
due,  as Sawyer had said. This delay of one day would have been 
welcome in other circumstances, but in present circumstances it 
was exceedingly unfortunate. When your letter arrived yesterday, 
I went straight to our baker, Whithers, as there was nothing left to 
pawn, and borrowed £1 from him. But when the bill arrived this 
morning, it was for £48-l-5d. and not, as I had thought, £46. It 
was my own fault, of course, for not noting the amount. I had 
thought Sawyer would have deducted the PROPRIETOR TAX which I 
had paid and which was not deducted from the previous bill (by 
law it falls on him). That was not the case. (He will therefore have 
to deduct the whole lot for next quarter.) Hence my mistake over 
the £46. The bill was presented this morning at 9 o'clock sharp, 
and I discovered to my horror that I was £2-l-5d. short. Que 
faire?"  I asked the presenter of the bill to wait (at our house), as I 
had to go and change some money. I had no alternative but to 
return to the good baker, who pulled a very long face, as I am 
deep in the red on account of his supplying of provisions. 
However, he performed. 
a What was to be done?

Ad voceiri 1 Trémauxh : your verdict 'that there is nothing to his 
whole theory because he knows nothing of geology, and is 
incapable of even the most common-or-garden literary-historical 
critique" recurs almost word for word in Cuvier's 'Discours sur les 
Révolutions du Globe' in his attack on the doctrine of the 
variabilité des espèces, d in which he makes fun of German 
nature-worshippers, among others, who formulated Darwin's basic 
idea in its entirety, however far they were from being able to prove 
it. However, that did not prevent Cuvier, who was a great 
geologist and for a naturalist also an exceptional literary-historical 
critic,  from being wrong, and the people who formulated the new 
idea, from being right. Trémaux's basic idea about the influence of 
the soil (although he does not, of course, attach any value to 
historical modifications of this influence, and I myself would 
include amongst these historical modifications the chemical altera­
tion in the surface soil brought about by agriculture, etc., as well 
as the varying influence which, with varying modes of production, 
such things as coalfields, etc., have) is, in my opinion, an idea 
which needs only to be formulated to acquire permanent scientific 
status,  and that quite independently of the way Trémaux presents 
it.

difference was no bigger and the good baker was at hand. So that 
you can repay the sum in question to that excellent man at once 
and thus preserve your credit, I am enclosing £5 I/F 59667, 
Manchester, 30 January 1865, for you, and am also returning the 
bill now settled. 
Ad vocem" Trémaux. When I wrote to you, I had admittedly 
only read a third of the book, and that was certainly the worst part 
(at the beginning). The second third, the critique of the schools, is 
far better; the third, the conclusions, very bad again. The man 
deserves credit for having emphasised the effect of the 'soil' on the 
evolution of races and logically of species as well more than had 
previously been done, and secondly for having worked out more 
accurate (though, in my view, still very one-sided) views on the 
effects of crossing than his predecessors. In one respect, Darwin is 
also right in his views on the effect crossing has in producing 
change, as Trémaux incidentally tacitly acknowledges, in that, 
when it suits him to do so, he also treats crossing as a means of 
change, even if ultimately as one that cancels itself out. Similarly, 
Darwin and others have never failed to appreciate the effect of the 
soil, and if they did not especially emphasise it, this was because 
they had no notion of how the soil exerts an influence—other 
than that fertility has a favourable and infertility an unfavourable 
effect. And Trémaux is little the wiser about that either. The 
hypothesis that, as a general rule, the soil favours the development 
of higher species to the extent that it belongs to more recent 
formations, sounds exceedingly plausible and may or may not be 
correct; however, when I see the ridiculous evidence with which 
Trémaux seeks to substantiate it, of which 9/10 is based on 
erroneous or distorted facts and the remaining '/,„ proves nothing, 
I cannot but extend the profound suspicions I have of the author 
of the hypothesis to the hypothesis  itself.  But when he then goes 
on to declare that the effect of the soil's greater or lesser age, 
modified by crossing, is the sole cause of change in organic species 
or races, I see absolutely no reason to go along with the man thus 
far, on the contrary, I see numerous objections to so doing. 
You say that Cuvier also criticised the German natural 
philosophers for their ignorance of geology when they proclaimed 
the mutability of species, and yet they were proved right.h At 
that time, however, the question had nothing to do with geology; 
but if someone puts forward a theory of the mutability of species 
based on geology alone and makes such geological howlers in it, 
a As regards - b See previous letter (p. 322).

falsifies the geology of whole countries (e.g., Italy and even 
France) and takes the rest of his examples from countries of 
whose geology we are as good as totally ignorant (Africa, Central 
Asia, etc.), then that is altogether a different matter. With regard 
to the ethnological examples in particular, the ones that concern 
countries and peoples which are generally known are almost 
without exception erroneous, either in their geological premisses 
or in the conclusions drawn from them—and he completely 
ignores the many contrary examples, e.g., the alluvial plains in 
Central Siberia, the enormous alluvial basin of the River Amazon, 
all the alluvial land southward from La Plata almost to the 
southern tip of America (east of the Cordilleras). 
That the geological structure of the soil is closely related to the 
'soil' in which everything grows is an old idea, likewise that this soil 
which is able to support vegetation influences the flora and fauna 
that subsist on it. It is also true that this influence has as yet been 
scarcely examined at all. But it is a colossal leap from there to 
Trémaux's theory. At all events, he deserves credit for having 
emphasised this previously neglected aspect, and, as I said, the 
hypothesis that the soil encourages evolution in proportion to its 
greater or lesser geological age, may be correct within certain limits 
(or again it may not), but all the further conclusions he draws I 
consider to be either totally mistaken or incredibly one-sided and 
exaggerated. 
I was very interested by Moilin's book," particularly for the 
results the French have obtained by vivisection; it is the only way 
to ascertain the functions of certain nerves and the effects of 
interfering with them; these fellows appear to have taken the art 
of animal-torture to a very high level of perfection; and I can very 
well understand the hypocritical fury of the English against 
vivisection; these experiments no doubt came as a most unpleasant 
surprise to many of the comatose gentlemen here and overturned 
many of their speculations. Whether there is anything new in the 
theory of inflammations, I am in no position to judge (I intend 
giving the book to Gumpert); this whole new French school does, 
however, appear to have a certain free-and-easy character, making 
big claims and being rather less scrupulous with evidence. As 
regards medicines, it contains nothing that any competent German 
doctor does not also know and accept; Moilin just forgets that 
1. one is often obliged to choose the lesser evil, medicine, in order 
to get rid of the greater, namely, a symptom which in itself 
a J. A. Moilin (le docteur Tony), Leçons de médecine physiologique.

represents a direct danger, in exactly the same way that by 
surgery one destroys tissues where there is no alternative, and 
2. that one does have to stick to the medicines for as long as one 
has nothing better. As soon as Moilin can cure syphilis with his 
electricity, mercury will soon vanish, but scarcely until then. 
Incidentally, no one can go on telling me that only the Germans 
can 'construct' systems, THE FRENCH BEAT THEM HOLLOW AT THAT.

Dear Friend, 
I hope I must not conclude from your lengthy silence that my 
last letterb has in any way offended you. The case should be quite 
the reverse. Any person, who is in desperate straits, sometimes 
feels the need to ventilate his feelings. But he only does so to 
people in whom he has a special and exceptional confidence. I do 
assure you that my domestic troubles disquiet me far more for 
being an obstacle to the completion of my work' than for any 
personal or family reasons. I could dispose of the whole problem 
tomorrow if I were prepared to take up a practical trade 
tomorrow, instead of working for the cause. And I equally hope 
that you are not embarrassed by the fact that you can do nothing 
to alleviate my plight. That would indeed be the most unreasona­
ble of reasons.

And now to some more general matters. 
I was profoundly apprehensive about the first congress in 
Geneva.373  By and large, however, it went off better than I 
expected. We had not in the least anticipated the effect it would 
have in France, England and America. I was unable to attend, nor 
did I wish to, but I did write the programme for the London 
delegates." I deliberately confined it to points which allow direct 
agreement and combination of efforts by the workers and give 
direct sustenance and impetus to the requirements of the class 
struggle and the organisation of the workers into a class. The 
Parisian gentlemen had their heads stuffed full of the most 
vacuous Proudhonist clichés. They prattle incessantly about science 
and know nothing. They spurn all revolutionary action, i.e. arising 
from the class struggle  itself,  every concentrated social movement, 
and therefore also that which can be achieved by political means 
(e.g., such as limitation of the working day by law). Beneath the 
cloak of freedom and anti-governmentalism or anti-authoritarian 
individualism these gentlemen, who for 16 years now have so 
quietly endured the most wretched despotism, and are still 
enduring it, are in actuality preaching vulgar bourgeois economics, 
only in the guise of Proudhonist idealism! Proudhon has done 
enormous harm. His pseudo-critique and his pseudo-confrontation 
with the Utopians (he himself is no more than a philistine 
Utopian, whereas the Utopias of such as Fourier, Owen, etc., 
contain the presentiment and visionary expression of a new world) 
seized hold of and corrupted first the 'jeunesse brillante','' the 
students, then the workers, especially those in Paris, who as 
workers in luxury trades are, without realising it,themselves deeply 
implicated in the garbage of the past. Ignorantly vain, arrogant, 
compulsively talkative, rhetorically inflated, they were on the verge 
of spoiling everything, as they flocked to the congress in numbers 
quite out of proportion to the number of their members. In my 
REPORT I shall give them a discreet rap over the knuckles. 
I was exceedingly pleased at the American workers' congress, 
which took place at the same time in Baltimore. The watchword 
there was organisation for the struggle against capital, and, 
remarkably enough, most of the demands I had put up for 
Geneva were put up there, too, by the correct instinct of the 
workers.383

and too much 'construing'. But a lot of criticism of traditional 
therapeutics, too. I would be glad if you would read the book and 
let me have your opinion in detail. I would also recommend to 
you Trémaux: 'De l'origine de tous les êtres, etc' Although written in

Dear Friend, 
Since I wish to reply to you at once and your letter has arrived 
just before the Post closes (and no post goes from here tomorrow, 
Sunday), I shall summarise the quintessence of my INTERCEPTED 
LETTER384  in a few words. (This confiscation of letters is certainly

not at all pleasant, as I have not the slightest desire to make 
Mr Bismarck a confidant to my private affairs. If, on the other 
hand, he wishes to know my views on his policies, he can approach 
me direct, and I am sure I shall not mince my words.) 
My economic situation has deteriorated so much following my 
prolonged illness and the many expenses it entailed that I am 
faced with a financial crisis in the immediate future, something 
which, quite apart from its direct effects on myself and family, 
would also be ruinous for me politically, especially here in 
London, where one must keep up appearances. What I wanted to 
find out from you was this: do you know anyone, or a few people 
(under no circumstances must the affair become public), who could 
advance me about 1,000 talers at an interest rate of 5 or 6% for at 
least 2 years? I am now paying 20-50% interest for the small 
sums I am borrowing, but for all that I can no longer keep the 
creditors at bay, with the result that the old firm is about to come 
crashing down about my ears. 
Since my penultimate letter to youa I have suffered another 
series of relapses and have consequently only been able to pursue 
my theoretical work very intermittently. (The practical work for 
the International Association goes on as ever, and there is a lot of 
it, as I am in fact having to run the whole Association myself.) I 
shall be sending the first sheetsb  to Meissner next month, and will 
continue to do so until I go to Hamburg with the remainder 
myself.  At all events, I shall take that opportunity to call on you. 
My circumstances (endless interruptions, both physical and 
social) oblige me to publish Volume One first, not both volumes 
together, as I had originally intended. And there will now 
probably be 3 volumes. 
The whole work is thus divided into the following parts: 
Book I. The Process of Production of Capital. 
Book II. The Process of Circulation of Capital. 
Book III. Structure of the Process as a Whole. 
Book IV. On the History of the Theory. 
The first volume will include the first 2 books. 
The 3rd book will, I believe, fill the second volume, the 4th the 
3rd.227 
It was, in my opinion, necessary to begin again ab ovo c in the 
first book, i. e., to summarise the book of mine published by 
Duncker d in one chapter on commodities and money.Ma I judged

this to be necessary, not merely for the sake of completeness, but 
because even intelligent people did not properly understand the 
question, in other words, there must have been defects in the first 
presentation, especially in the analysis of commodities Lassalle, e. g., 
in his Kapital und Arbeit,* in which he claims to give the 
'Intellectual quintessence' of my argument, makes serious blun­
ders,  which is incidentally something to which he is always prone 
with his very carefree manner of appropriating my works. It is 
comical how he even copies my literary-historical 'errors', because, 
you see, I sometimes quote from memory, without checking 
things. I have not yet finally made up my mind whether to pass a 
few remarks in the foreword about Lassalle's plagiarising. The 
impudence of his disciples towards me would at all events justify 
it.105 
The London COUNCIL of the ENGLISH TRADE-UNIONS (its secretary is 
our President, Odger) is deliberating at the present moment as to 
whether it should declare itself to be the BRITISH SECTION OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION. If it does so, the control of the working 
class here will IN  A CERTAIN  SENSE  pass into our hands, and we shall be 
able to give the movement a good 'PUSH ON'.18

least 20 people, so that the share that fell to me at the beginning 
of the summer  was  — 80 talers! My attempts to drum up money in 
Germany or Holland have all come to nothing. The only thing 
that still makes us think of the pawnshop (and my wife has 
pawned so many possessions that she herself can scarcely go out) is 
the interest it asks for. I thus had to go round London begging 
small loans left and right, as in our worst refugee days—and that 
from a limited number of people who are themselves impecuni­
ous—to make even the most essential cash purchases. On the 
other hand, I am being threatened by tradesmen, some of whom 
have withdrawn their credit and threatened to take me to court. 
This state of affairs was all the more critical in that Lafargue (until 
his departure for Bordeaux a few days ago) was constantly in the

from him. Not merely has my work" been frequently interrupted 
by all this, but by trying to make up at night for the time lost

Prussians will be Prussians. As a reward for voting for the 
indemnity, Twesten and Frenzel are arraigned for speeches made 
in the Chamber.388 Such stupidity is quite incomprehensible, but it 
is a point of principle.The burghers3 of Frankfurt are still furious, 
they are now playing the part of Poles, going about in mourning 
and wearing cravats with the city colours of Frankfurt.362  A 
Prussian lieutenant entered a Sachsenhausen tavern and found all 
the seats taken. Someone got up in one corner and left, at which 
his neighbour drew the lieutenant's attention to the empty chair, 
but he said thank you very much, he did not like to sit on a warm 
chair. Oh, said the other, you have no need to worry about that, 
our bums are all freezing since the Prussians have been here. 
I have heard the most marvellous stories here from eyewitnesses 
about the Imperial warfare.b  Such things are unprecedented. E.g., 
the Nassauers were ordered to bridge the Main at Höchst. Having 
failed once on account of a storm (a storm on the Main!), they 
found upon their 2nd attempt that they had too few pontoons and 
could only bridge the Main half-way. They therefore wrote to 
Darmstadt, asking for the loan of a few pontoons, which did 
eventually arrive then, and thus the bridge over the horrendous 
stream was completed. Then the Nassauers immediately received 
orders to march south. They left the bridge standing, without a 
guard, merely leaving it to the care of an old boatman to see that 
it did not drift away down the Main. A few days later, the 
Prussians arrived, took possession of the completed bridge, 
fortified it and marched across!

My dear Mr Lafargue, 
I hope our friend il amoroso* has apologised to you on my 
behalf for my inexcusable silence. On the one hand, I have been 
plagued by constantly recurring illness, on the other, I have been 
so taken up by a very lengthy work b that I have neglected my 
correspondence with my closest friends. If I did not count you 
among that category, I should never have dared so to offend 
against propriety. 
My sincere thanks for the wine. Being myself from a wine­
growing region, and former owner of a vineyard,390 I know a good 
wine when I come across one. I even incline somewhat to old 
Luther's view that a man who does not love wine will never be 
good for anything. (There are exceptions to every rule.) But one 
cannot, for example, deny that the political movement in England 
has been spurred on by the commercial treaty with France and the 
import of French wines.391 That is one of the good things that 
Louis Bonaparte was capable of doing, whereas poor Louis 
Philippe was so intimidated by the manufacturers in the North 
that he did not dare enter into commercial treaties with England. 
It is only to be regretted that regimes such as the Napoleonic one, 
which are founded on the weariness and impotence of the two 
antagonistic classes of society, buy some material progress at the 
expense of general demoralisation. Fortunately, the mass of 
working men cannot be demoralised. Manual labour is the great 
antidote for all the ills of society. 
You will have been just as delighted by the defeat of President 
Johnson in the latest elections as I was.392 The workers in the 
North have at last fully understood that white labour will never be 
emancipated so long as black labour is still stigmatised.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 8 December 1866 
Dear FRED, 
Meissner has not begun printing yet," as he wanted to finish off 
some other things first. I am expecting a letter from him next 
Monday. All in all, I found the delay by no means disagreeable, as 
I have only been rid of that vile carbuncle for a few days, and, 
moreover, my creditors are badgering me in a truly edifying 
manner. I only regret that private persons CAN not FILE THEIR  BILLS  FOR 
THE BANKRUPTCY COURT with the same propriety as men of business. 
A while ago, Kladderadatsch printed a swipe at the Brimstone 
Gang in large type, in a bad lampoon on Collins' The Woman in 
White. The author of this garbage is that miserable Bettziech, and 
I should not be surprised if the order had emanated from Kinkel 
or Hatzfeldt. Nor have I any doubt that the old bag was the cause 
of Liebknecht's arrest. 393 
The Prussian swine are acting precisely as we should wish them 
to. There will be no progress until heads roll. 
Salut.

positions here; agents, or such as would like to be so; then this 
week my most likeable nephew Blanka as well, who has established 
himself in London—and so it goes on continuously, and you will 
realise how difficult it is thereby to find the time to write. Then, 
from time to time, I also get someone arriving on the doorstep 
like the writer of the enclosed letter394  and putting a pistol to my 
breast. When I read the letter, I knew at once who had sent this 
sterling fellow to plague me—it was good old Dr Rode, as the said 
sterling fellow indeed confirmed when he came up to my office. 
This shameless Rode is taking some weird liberties in my regard. 
First, he makes the silliest kind of trouble between myself and 
Klings after the latter called here, b and then he even goes so far as 
to send people like that to plague me, referring them to me as 
cashier for the whole émigré community. If the fellow attempts 
anything else of that kind with me, he may be sure of a warm 
response. Why cannot he leave me be, I do not know him at all? 
The Prussian swine are certainly behaving quite splendidly. I 
would indeed not have imagined them to be quite so stupid, but it 
is really impossible to imagine them stupid enough. That is all to 
the good. Things are on the move again now, and the revolution 
will come all the sooner for it, and this time heads are bound to 
roll, as you yourself say. 
They are locking up the office, and I must close, too. Enclosed 
two five-pound-notes: 
I/S 38969 and I/S 62239, Manchester, 26 January 1866. 
That is as much as I can risk sending until I know how I stand, 
and I cannot check on it until the books are made up. 
Kindest regards to your wife and children.

MARX  TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  17 December  1866 
DEAR FRED. 
THANKS  FOR THE  £10. 
As far as  Rode  is concerned,  he is  obsessed with political 
connections  and his own  self-importance.  As you are  finding this 
obsession  a nuisance—and  JUSTLY  SO—you  should write  to him at 
the first opportunity saying that  you  have  not the  honour  of his 
acquaintance  and  requesting  him to  desist from such  LIBERTIES. 
The Revue  des deux Mondes  and the  Revue Contemporaine  had two 
detailed articles  on the  'INTERNATIONAL',  which treat  it and its  congress 
as one of the  most significant events  of the  century. a The  like also 
in The  Fortnightly Review,  in  consequence.b  Meanwhile,  we are in 
practice paralysed  BY  WANT  OF FUNDS  and even  OF MEN,  with all the 
English being totally absorbed  by the  REFORM MOVEMENT.  The  French 
government  is (heureusement) beginning  to treat  us as  enemies. 395 
One of our  more dubious  ACQUISITIONS  was the  joining (AT  New 
York) of  HEAD CENTRE  396 Stephens. 
Was not the  Pope'sd address  to the  French  OFFICERS  capital? Only 
an Italian priest could thus, before  the  whole  of Europe, deliver 
Bonaparte  a kick  in the  form  of a  BLESSING.397 
It is highly characteristic  of the  status rerume that neither 
Bonaparte  nor  William  the  Conquerorf  are  quite right  in the top 
DEPARTMENT.  The  latter believes that  God  Almighty  has  entrusted 
him with  a special mission,  and the  former  has  been  TURNED  SO 
TOPSYTURVY  by Mexico2?0  and  Bismarck that  he  sometimes appears 
positively demented. 
And do you not  think that there will  be peace  for  another year 
yet at least (apart from  ACCIDENTS,  of course, such  as the  death  of 
Bonaparte, etc.)?  The  fellows  all  need time  for the  CONVERSION  and 
PRODUCTION  OF ARMS,  do they not? 
Not a word from  Mr  Meissner  yet. I  presume that  now, at the 
a L. Reybaud, 'L'économie politique  des ouvriers', Revue  des deux Mondes,  Vol. 66, 
1 November  1866; J. E.  Alaux,  'Une  forme nouvelle  du  socialisme.  Le  Congrès 
ouvrier  de Genève', Revue contemporaine, Vol. 53, 15 October 1866.  - b Marx refers  to 
an editorial published  in The  Fortnightly Review,  No. 37,  December 1866.  -

year's  end, he  finds  the  pressure  of  business very great.  The 
contract does give  me  surety  in the  event  of any  evasive 
manoeuvres.  In the  second, emended  and  definitive version,  the 
contract contains  NO  STIPULATION WHATEVER  AS TO THE  TERM  FOR  WHICH  THE 
MANUSCRIFI  a is TO BE READY.  But if there is no answer by tomorrow, I shall 
write again. 
As you  enjoy credit with quelconque" bookseller  and I  CAN  not 
SPEND  a FARTHING  on books at the moment, you would be doing me a 
great favour  if you  could  get as  quickly  as  possible  for me: 
'/. E. Th.  Rogers:  A History  of  Agriculture'.  I must have  a look  at 
the book  and  have left  a gap in one  chapter  for the  purpose. 398 
Although  it has  already been  out for a  long time,  it is not yet in 
the library.  Nor at  Mudie's,  so I am  assured  by Eccarius,  for  whom 
The Commonwealth took  out a  subscription there.

Dear Moor, 
I also think that  the  leaders  in Western Europe will  do  their 
utmost  to  preserve  the  peace next year  and  until everyone  is 
equipped with breech-loaders. However, whether  the  Russians 
will not  consider this very time opportune  for  cutting Austria 
down  to size with Bismarck's help,  for  annexing Galicia and dividing 
Turkey  up  into  a  multitude  of  small Slav states,  is 
another question. Moreover,  it could happen that  in France,  too, 
war will become  a necessity—for  the  sake  of  this military 
reorganisation, because without  a war  good  old  Boustrapa7<i will

not be able to get it accepted. The last wara has placed the fellow 
in a curious dilemma: either he lets everything stand as it is, in 
which case he will no longer be a MATCH for Prussia, or else he 
carries the matter out, which will be disastrous for him, first 
because of his tremendous unpopularity, and second because he is 
completely debonapartising the army. From the moment that some 
kind of military service for all is introduced in France, the 
praetorian system400 will cease of its own accord and the 25-30% 
of RE-ENLISTED FELLOWS, who now serve in the French army, will 
disappear for the most part. However, as there will still be 
substitution,401 this time Mr Bonaparte will find himself in the 
comical predicament of needing the support of the bourgeoisie to 
oppose the peasantry. But the course of history really is quite 
impudently ruthless in dealing with this noble fellow, and he must be 
forgiven if he loses faith in the ways of God and the World. I hope 
he, like me, reads his Horace for recreation: justum ac tenacem 
propositi virum,b  etc. Old Horace reminds me in places of Heine, who 
learnt a great deal from him and was au fond c politiced no less 
common a cur. Remember how the sterling fellow challenged the 
vultus instantis tyranni" and licked Augustus' boots. And the old goat 
is quite charming in other respects, too. 
I will get the bookf for you next week if I can. 
It is very pleasing about the articles in the Revue des deux Mondes 
and Fortnightly, although I have not yet been able to read them. 8

Wehner, who was recently in Germany, tells the following 
anecdote, which was told by Bennigsen (of the National Associa­
tion ll2)  himself:  when Bennigsen had his meeting with Bismarck 
before the war, the latter expounded his whole National-
Associationist German policy to him, whereupon Bennigsen 
enquired how it was that Bismarck was choosing the difficult path 
of war in order to carry it out, instead of simply 'relying on the 
support of the people', as the liberal cry has it. Bismarck stared at 
him for a few moments and then said: Could you jump a ditch 
with a rheumatic nag? He also brought back the news that the 
unhappy Crown Prince,1 who used to put on such liberal airs, has

DEAR FRED, 
Happy New Year! Ditto for Madame Lizzyb! May the devil take

Apropos. The French government had confiscated papers and 
documents intended for us which were being brought across the 
frontier by French MEMBERS after the Geneva Congress, and 
attached them for the police archives. We claimed the things back 
through Lord Stanley, FOREIGN MINISTER, as 'BRITISH PROPERTY'. And in 
fact POOR Bonaparte had to surrender everything to us via the 
FOREIGN OFFICE. IS that not priceless! He has been outwitted but 
himself does not know how.

MARX TO ENGELS 26 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 19 January 1867 
Dear Engels, 
After a long silence, for which he pleaded overwork, Meissner 
has written that my plan 'is unacceptable to him'. 
1. He wants to have the 2 volumes'' ready at the same time233; 
2. not to print piecemeal, as he wants to have one proof-sheet 
done per day and only to leave the final correction (revision) to 
me. 
I replied ad 2 that it is a matter of indifference to me, as he can 
shortly have the whole manuscript of Volume I. If he commences 
printing later but prints by so much faster, it will be all the same 
in the end. However, in the case of a book with so much 
annotation in various languages, he should reflect whether the 
manner of correcting he is wanting is feasible without the text 
being gravely marred by printing errors. Ad 1, it is an 
impossibility without the whole job being greatly delayed, nor is 
anything of the kind agreed in our contract. I explicated the 
various reasons to him, but have as yet had no reply.111 
Aside from the delay, a yet greater obstacle to my committing 
myself to the 2nd volume is the fact that, when the first one has 
appeared, I shall have to make a pause for my health's sake; and I 
shall in any case have to travel to the Continent to ascertain 
whether I can in any way sort out my financial circumstances. 
These are becoming worse day by day, and there is a danger of 
everything coming crashing about our heads. The baker alone is 
owed £20, and there is the very devil with butcher, GROCER, TAXES, 
etc. To crown it all, I recently received a letter from a Mr Burton 
in Torquay, informing me he has bought the house from Sawyer, 
and he is dunning me 1. for the outstanding rent for the last 
of Capital

QUARTER, 2. as my lease expires in March, requesting me to state if I 
wish to take the house subsequently, either for a longer LEASE or 
annually. I did not reply immediately. Whereupon I received a 
second letter yesterday, saying I must explain  myself,  as otherwise 
his 'AGENT' would have to take steps to find another tenant. So IN  A 
FIX. 
As for my physical condition, it has been better for some weeks, 
a few small carbuncles on my left loin, but not significant. Only 
dreadful insomnia, which makes me very RESTLESS, although the 
chief cause is probably mental. 
THANKS  for the Rogers.3 A lot of material in it. Regarding the 
STRIKE question, or at least the Manchester  WEAVERS'  DISPUTE, I should 
be obliged to you if you would write me an exact account of the 
STATE OF AFFAIRS, as I can still include it.b

and also  see how you can put  money  in your purse  on the 
Continent.  I think  it will be all  right  if you  take  him the  rest of the 
manuscript  yourself. 
The position regarding  WORKINGMEN  AND  MANUFACTURERS  is as 
follows: India, China, Levant,  etc.,  grossly oversupplied,  in 
consequence  of which CALICOS have been almost unsaleable  for the 
last 6 months.  In some districts feeble attempts  by the  MANUFACTUR­
ERS to organise SHORT TIME ensued. Being only sporadic,  all of  these 
collapsed. Meanwhile,  the  manufacturers  go and  send consignments 
of their goods, unsaleable here,  to India  and  China,  etc.,  thereby 
aggravating  the  GLUT. They then discover that this does  not  agree 
with them either,  and  they finally propose  the  HANDS should take  a 
5% REDUCTION  OF WAGES.  Whereupon counterproposal from  the  HANDS 
to work just  4 days  a week. Refus"  of the  MASTERS—AGITATION.  In the 
last fortnight, finally,  a situation  has  gradually been reached,  and 
most recently become general, where SHORT TIME  at 4  days  a week 
has been introduced everywhere  in the  weaving mills  and in the 
spinning mills that spin  for  them,  in some cases with  and in  some 
cases without  the 5%  reduction  in wages.  The  workers therefore 
were right  in theory  and  were proved right  in practice, too. 404 
The scoundrel Bismarck  has  splendidly gulled  the  scoundrel 
Bonaparte over  the  Peace  of Prague, exactly  as Bonaparte gulled 
the Austrians  at Villafranca about  the  expelled Italian princes  qui 
rentreront dans leurs états b—but without recourse  to foreign 
troops.365  Bismarck  is thus saying:  the  South German states auront 
une existence internationale indépendante/  but  only for so  long  as 
they themselves wish; from  the  moment that they wish  to join with 
us, they shall  be entirely free  to do so,  otherwise after  all they 
would  be not  indépendants! 405 POOR Bonaparte  has  never been  a 
member  of a  student fraternity  at a  German university,  nor has he 
ever practised  the art of  interpretation  at one of  their beer-
conventions,  and is  consequently  no match  for the Hon.  Bismarck. 
In Hanover they  are  most frightfully vexed  at the  Prussians, 355 
and not  just  the  city itself  but  even more  so  amongst  the 
peasantry — they  are  flocking  to the  queend  and  putting  all their 
assets  at her  disposal. 
There  is much ludicrous sentimentality therein, mixed with 
hatred  for the  military  and the  police;  the  very same people,  e. g., 
are themselves saying that  the  administration  is much improved, 
etc., but the  Prussians' talent  for  inspiring hatred  for  themselves

I have had some additional expenses, firstly £2 for champagne

The work" will soon be complete, and would have been so today

Dear Moor, 
The reason I have not written to you is in part that all manner 
of things have prevented me, but in part also it was deliberate, as I 
wanted to let the date pass when 'the book'b  was due to be 
completed, and now I hope that it is ready. So, when will you be 
going to see Mr Meissner? When you do, I will give you an 
authorisation to collect the fee for my last pamphlet. c 
Apropos the latter, by now the Lassallean gentlemen will have 
had time enough to convince themselves how right I was about the 
effect of universal suffrage and the power it would give the 
aristocracy in the countryside.d The Lassallean gentlemen failed to 
get 2 men through; the two Saxon workers' candidates6 who did 
get through are very dubious and appear to be rather of Wuttke's 
ilk. As a whole, incidentally, the elections did show that in 
Germany they are not remotely susceptible to the kinds of 
pressure that can be applied to them in France, and that is already 
to the good.408 I am also convinced that the more bureaucratic 
meddling there is, the worse each fresh election in Germany will

controlled elections such as we have had in France are impossible 
in our country. 
But what a fine lot we have in the noble House,409  to be sure! 
They may pull a wry face but they won't offer much protest as 
they are bartering away the few lousy safeguards still contained in 
the Prussian constitution for the indirect annexation of the 
6 million people in the little states, who have de facto already been 
annexed and mediatised without any constitution at all. 376 Au 
fond,*  it is quite immaterial what nonsense the fellows contrive; 
with the philistines in their present mood of Bismarckolatry, they 
represent bourgeois public opinion and will only do what the latter 
wants.  The worthy burgher seems determined to avoid any 
further 'conflict'. The movement—both at home, where it is now 
bestirring itself once more, and in Europe—will soon enough

and everywhere, but got nowhere. I have been sent 2 pamphlets 
about him from Barmen, of which one enclosed and the other, 
shorter one, to follow; I do not have it with me. The enclosed 
obviously bears the mark of the Hatzfeldt lot. 
Stieber is again creating in the Volks-Zeitung over Eichhoff's 
pieces in the Hermann, Koller is also mentioned. See Hermann. 410 
The moderate result of universal suffrage in Germany has, in 
any case, contributed to the sudden popularity of  HOUSEHOLD  SUFFRAGE 
in official circles here. It would be splendid if  HOUSEHOLD  SUFFRAGE  got 
through as a result, there would soon be a good many changes 
here and the movement would get going. 
TRADE HERE  is still stagnant to an exceeding degree. India and 
China have been swamped by the consignments from the 
manufacturers, 20,000 people are on STRIKE in Stockport,  SHORT  TIME 
is spreading and, if this does not change soon, in May we shall 
have a superb crisis of overproduction. That can only benefit the 
radical reform movement. 
The Diplomatic Review is excellent this time.b Provided old 
D. Urquhart gets hold of FACTS, he is  ALL RIGHT; but Beust's curious 
manoeuvres had already aroused my suspicions. Notwithstanding 
the fact that the Saxons (videc Mr von Seebach in the Crimean

difficult to decide whether the Russians have actually bought the 
fellow or whether they have got him gratis and without being 
aware of it. It almost seems to me that the boundless vanity of

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 2 Aprilb 1867 
Dear Engels, 
I had resolved not to write to you until I could announce 
completion of the book,' which is now the case. Nor did I wish to 
bore you by explaining the further delay, viz., carbuncles on my 
posterior and near the PENIS, the final traces of which are now 
fading but which made it extremely painful for me to adopt a 
sitting (hence writing) posture. 1 am not taking arsenic because it 
dulls my mind too much and I needed to keep my wits about me 
at least at those times when writing was possible. 
Next week I shall have to take the manuscript to Hamburg 
myself. 412 I did not like the tone of Mr Meissner's last letter. 
Added to which, I received the enclosed scrawl from Borkheim 
yesterday. I have every reason to believe that the 'continental 
friend' is Mr Privy Councillor Bucher. 413 Borkheim had written 
him a letter, you know, which he read out to me, about his 
arrangements for travelling to Silesia, which he wishes to visit on 
family business. Bücher replied directly. I therefore scent a plot 
behind these canards and will have to put the knife to Meissner's 
a The end of this letter is missing. - b The original has: 27 March. - c the first 
volume of Capital

breast  myself.  Otherwise, the fellow would be in a position to hold 
back my manuscript (some 25 closely printed proof-sheets by my 
reckoning) and, at the same time, not have it printed on the 
pretext that he was 'awaiting' the second volume. 233 
I must now  d'abord 3 reclaim my clothes and timepiece from their 
abode at the pawnbroker's. I can also hardly leave my family in 
their present situation, they being sans sou h and the creditors 
becoming more brazen each day. Finally, before I forget, all the 
money that I could afford to spend on Laura's champagne-
treatment has gone the way of all flesh. She now needs red wine, 
of better quality than I can command. Voilà la situation. 1 
Our 'INTERNATIONAL' has just celebrated a great victory. We were 
providing financial support from the LONDON TRADE-UNIONS for the 
Paris bronze WORKERS, who were out on STRIKE. As soon as the 
masters learnt of that, they gave in.414 The affair has created a 
deal of commotion in the French papers, and we are now an 
established force in France. 
It appears to me there must have been collusion between 
Bismarck and Bonaparte over the Luxemburg affair. It is possible, 
though improbable, that the former either cannot or will not keep 
his word.415 That the Russians have been meddling in German 
affairs is crystal clear from: 
1. the treaty between Württemberg and Prussia, which was 
already concluded on 13 August before all the others; 
2. Bismarck's demeanour in respect of the Poles.416 
The Russians are more active than ever. They are setting the 
stage for trouble between France and Germany. Austria is pretty 
well paralysed in  herself.  Our English gentlemen are about to be 
led a fine song and dance in the UNITED STATES.

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 4 April 1867 
Dear Moor, 
Hurrah! There was no holding back that exclamation when at 
last I read in black and white that the 1st volume3 is complete and 
that you intend taking it to Hamburg at once. So that you shall 
not be short of the nervus rerum,h  I am sending you enclosed the 
halves of seven five-pound-notes, £35 in toto, and will despatch 
the other halves immediately I receive the usual telegram. Do not 
let the scrawl from Bücher 413—it is undoubtedly from him—worry 
you, it is just Prussian police gossip and the scandal-mongering 
of men of letters, of the same ilk as that recent stuff about the 
Polish trip.406  I enclose a note for you to give to Meissner, so that 
you can also collect my fee. c 
There is no longer even a shadow of doubt about the alliance 
between Bismarck and the Russians. However, the Russians have 
never yet had to pay so high a price for their Prussian alliance, 
they have had to sacrifice their whole traditional policy in 
Germany and, if this time they were to imagine, as is their wont, 
that it is only 'for the moment', they may well be making the very 
deuce of a blunder. For all the shouting about the Empire, etc., 
German unity already seems on the point of outgrowing Bismarck 
and all those Prussians. They will have to press on all the harder 
in the Orient—the Russians, that is—, the present favourable 
conjuncture will surely not endure long. But how great does the 
financial need have to be and how sluggish must the industrial 
progress be, s'il y'en a, d in Russia, if those fellows are still without a 
railway to Odessa and Bessarabia, 11 years after the Crimean War, 
when it would now be worth two armies to them! And so I also 
believe that the storm will break this year, if everything goes well 
for the Russians. 
The Luxemburg affair415 appears to be taking the same course 
as with Saarlouis and Landau.369 Bismarck undoubtedly offered to 
sell it in 1866, but Louise really does seem to have held back at 
a of Capital - b sinew of things - c for The Prussian Military Question and the German 
Workers' Party (see this volume, p. 348) - d if there is any - e Napoleon III

that time in the hope that he would later get far more as a present 
I have positive knowledge that the Prussian Ambassador Bernstorff 
told the Hanseatic ditto (Geffcken) in London a few days ago that 
he had received a despatch to the effect that Prussia was not going 
to give way over the Luxemburg question under any cir­
cumstances. This is the same despatch that The Owl refers to as 
requesting Britain to make representations at The Hague, which 
are then said to have succeeded in making Holland withdraw from 
the deal. The point is that in the present situation Bismarck 
cannot remotely allow the French to annex German territory 
without making all his achievements appear ridiculous. What is 
more, that old jackass William1 ' has gone and pronounced the 
words 'not a single German village' and is personally committed. It 
is, however, as yet by no means certain that the deal may not still 
come to fruition after all; the Kölnische Zeitung is screaming quite 
hysterically that we really cannot start a war over Luxemburg and 
that we have no right to it at all; Luxemburg, they say, should no 
longer be counted part of Germany, etc., so they have never 
behaved quite so despicably. 
Bismarck may not be Faust, but he does have his Wagener. b The 
way in which the poor devil translates his Lord and Master into 
Wagnerese makes you die of laughing. Bismarck recently em­
ployed another of his horse-metaphors, and not wanting to be 
outdone in this either, Wagener ended a speech by trumpeting: 
Gentlemen, it is time for us to stop riding our hobby-horses and to 
mount that noble thoroughbred mare GermaniaV Montez Mademoiselle, 4 
the Parisians used to say during the Terror.417 
I hope that your carbuncles are more or less mended now and 
that the journey will help get rid of them entirely. You must put 
an end to this nonsense this summer.

MARX TO ENGELS" 
IN MANCHESTER 
Hamburg, 13 April 1867 
Dear FRED, 
I arrived here at 12 o'clock noon yesterday. The boat left 
London on Wednesdaya at 8 o'clock in the morning.412 In which 
fact you see the whole history of the voyage. The most fearful 
weather and gales. Having been confined for so long, I felt as 
voraciously fit as 500 hogs.b  However, with  ALL that riti-raff being 
sea-sick and falling about to left and right of us, it would all have 
become ennuyant' in time, if a certain NUCLEUS had not held firm. It 
was a very 'mixed' nucleus, viz., a German ship's captain, who bore 
a marked resemblance to yourself in his face, but a small fellow, 
he also had a good deal of your humour and the same 
good-natured frivolous twinkling of the eyes; a London cattle-
dealer, a true John Bull, BOVINE IN EVERY RESPECT; a German 
clockmaker from London, a nice fellow; a German from Texas; 
and, the real protagonist, a German who had been roaming 
around Eastern Peru for 15 years, an area that has only recently 
been geographically charted, where, amongst other things, human 
flesh is still consumed in no mean quantity. An eccentric, energetic 
and high-spirited fellow. He had a most valuable collection of 
stone axes with him, etc., which merited being discovered in the 
'caves'.  One female personage as hanger-on (the other ladies were 
all SEASICK and vomiting in the ladies CABIN), a toothless old hag with 
a refined Hanoverian accent, daughter of some primeval 
Hanoverian minister, von Baer or suchlike, she has now long been 
an improver of men, pietistic, concerned to raise the condition of 
the working class, acquainted with Jules Simon, full of spiritual 
radiance, with which she bored our BOVINE FRIEND to death. WELL! On 
Thursday evening, when the storm was at its worst, with all the 
tables and chairs adance, we were boozing en petit comité, d with that 
old hag of a woman lying on a couch, from which the movement 
of the ship—to divert her a trifle—occasionally tipped her onto 
the floor in the middle of the cabin. What was keeping this 
beautiful creature so spellbound in these inimical circumstances?

Why  did she not  withdraw  to the  ladies' chamber?  Our  savage 
German  was  regaling  us with  an enthusiastic account  of the  sexual 
depravities  of  savages. Voilà  le charme"  for this delicate, pure, 
refined lady.  One  example:  he was  received  in an  Indian  hut 
where  the  woman  was  giving birth that very  day. The  afterbirth  is 
roasted and—supreme expression  of hospitality—he  is obliged  to 
partake of the  SWEETBREAD! 
I called  on  Meissner immediately upon  our  arrival. Clerk tells 
me he  won't  be back before  3 o'clock (afternoon).  I left  my  card 
and invited  Mr  Meissner  to dine with  me. He  came  but he had 
someone with  him and  wanted  me to  accompany  him as his  wife 
was expecting  him. I  declined  but  agreed that  he  should call  on 
me at 7  o'clock  in the  evening.  He  mentioned  en  passant that 
Strohn  was  probably still  in  Hamburg.  I therefore called  on 
Strohn's brother. b Our man had left for Paris  THE  VERY SAME MORNING. 
So, Meissner came round  in the  evening.  A pleasant fellow, 
despite something Saxon about  him, as his  name suggests. After  a 
brief parley, everything  ALL RIGHT.  Manuscript taken straight  to his 
publishing house, where  it was put in a  SAFE.  Printing will start  IN A 
FEW DAYS  and  proceed apace.  We  then drank together,  and he 
expressed  his  great 'delight'  at making  my  esteemed acquaintance. 
He now wants that  the  book should appear  in 3  volumes.  In particular 
he is opposed  to my  compressing  the  final book  (the  historico-literary 
part) as I had  intended.  He  said that from  the  publishing point  of 
view  and  with  the  'dull' mass  of readers  in mind, this was  the  part  by 
which  he was  setting most store.  I told  him  that,  as far as  that  was 
concerned,  I was his to  command. 418 
AT ALL  EVENTS,  in Meissner  we have someone entirely  at our 
disposal;  he has  great contempt  for the  whole pack  of vulgar 
scribblers.  I thought  it prudent  to  delay presenting your  LITTLE 
BILL. C Always keep  the  pleasantest surprises till last. 
And now  adio,  OLD BOY.

Dear Friend, 
I left London by STEAMER last Wednesday" and after a tempestu­
ous crossing reached Hamburg on Friday afternoon to deliver the 
manuscript of the first volume to Mr Meissner there. Printing has 
already started at the beginning of this week, so that the first 
volume will appear at the end of May. The whole work will appear 
in 3 volumes. 418 The title is Capital. A Critique of Political Economy. 
The first volume comprises the First Book: 'The Process of 
Production of Capital'. It is without question the most terrible MISSILE 
that has yet been hurled at the heads of the bourgeoisie 
(landowners included). It is important now that you draw attention 
to the forthcoming publication in the press, i.e., in the papers to 
which you have access.

MARX TO ENGELS 101 
IN MANCHESTER 
Hanover, 24 April 1867 
Dear FRED, 
I have been here as Dr Kugelmann's guest for a week now. I 
was obliged to stay in Hamburg or right near Hamburg on 
account of the printing. b Things stand as follows. Meissner wants 
to have the whole undertaking complete in 4-5 weeks, but cannot 
get the printing done in Hamburg, both because there are not 
enough printers, and because the proof-readers are insufficiently 
learned. He is therefore having the printing done at Otto 
Wigand's (or RATHER his son's, c as that puffed-up old cur only has a 
nominal share in the business now). He sent the manuscript to 
Leipzig a week ago. He now wants to have me to hand to check the 
first 2 proof-sheets and at the same lime to decide whether it is 
'possible' to print quickly with a single proof-reading on my part. In 
this case, the whole undertaking would be complete in 4-5 weeks. 
However, Easter week is now holding it up. Wigand Jr wrote to 
Meissner that he cannot start until the end of this week. At 
Kugelmann's pressing invitation, I therefore came here (which also 
a Entirely yours - b of the first volume of Capital - c Hugo Wigand

has economic advantages) for the interim. Before I say anything 
about 'local' affairs, I must not forget to tell you: Meissner would 
appreciate it, and asks me to pass on the request to you, if you 
would write a warning concerning Russia, for the benefit of the 
Germans and the French simultaneously. If you do undertake it, 
he wishes it done quickly. He would, however, prefer you to write 
at some length rather than more briefly, as small pamphlets do not 
sell well. You could discuss conditions when you send him the 
manuscript, as he says the two of you would not fall out over the 
matter. You could write with 'no holds barred', as Meissner 
considers that there is no need whatever to be concerned about 
considerations. 
Regarding Hanover, then. 
Kugelmann is a doctor of great eminence in his special field, 
which is gynaecology. He is in correspondence with Virchow and 
the other authorities (including one Meyer in Berlin) and formerly 
with von Siebold in Göttingen and with Semmelweis in Vienna, 
before he went mad. Whenever there is a difficult case in this field 
over here, he is always brought in as consultant. As an instance of 
the professional jealousy and stupidity of the locals, he told me he 
had initially been blackballed, i.e., not admitted to the doctors' 
association here, because 'gynaecology' is a 'cesspit of immorality'. 
Kugelmann is very talented technically, too. He has invented a 
mass of new instruments in this field. 
Kugelmann is secondly a fanatical supporter (and for my taste 
excessively Westphalian in his admiration) of our ideas and the 
two of us personally. He sometimes bores me with his enthusiasm, 
which is at odds with the detachment he displays as a doctor. But 
he understands, and he is a really excellent man, unaffected by 
qualms, capable of making sacrifices, and, most important of all, 
convinced. He has a charming little wife and an  8-year  old 
daughter who is positively sweet." He has in his possession a far 
better collection of our works than the two of us together. I even 
came across The Holy Family again here, which he presented to me 
and of which he will be sending you a copy. I was pleasantly 
surprised to find that we have no need to feel ashamed of the 
piece, although the Feuerbach cult now makes a most comical 
impression upon one. The ordinary people, and in the capital, 
Hanover, even the bourgeoisie, are extremely hostile to the 
Prussians (ditto in Electoral Hesse) and miss no opportunity of 
expressing their sentiments. They openly proclaim their longing— 
a Gertruda and Franziska Kugelmann 

=====第399页=====
217. Marx to Engels. 24 April 1867 361 
for the French. If one remarks to them that this is unpatriotic, they 
say, 'The Prussians did just the same thing. When they marched 
through here, they were boasting, the officers first and foremost 
among them, that the French would come to their aid—if need 
be.' Wehner's father is much respected here and is considered a 
Guelph.420  Bismarck sent one of his satraps, the advocate 
Warnebold, to see me yesterday (keep this under your hat). He 
wishes to 'make use of me and my great talents in the interests of 
the German people'. Von Benningsen will be paying 'meah' a his 
respects tomorrow. 
The standing the two of us enjoy in Germany, particularly 
among the 'educated' officials, is of an altogether different order 
from what we imagined. Thus, e.g., the director of the statistical 
bureau here, Merkel, visited me and told me, he had been 
studying questions of money for years to no avail, and I had 
immediately clarified the matter once and for all. 'Your Dioscurus 
Engels,' he told me, 'was recently acknowledged by my colleague 
Engel before the royal family in Berlin.' These are trifling things, 
but they are important for us. We have more influence on these 
officials than on the louts. 
I was also invited to attend the society of 'Europeans', as they 
call the anti-Prussian, North-Germanic members of the National 
Association 152 here. What jackasses! 
I also received an invitation from the head (head-in-chief, as 
Stieber calls it421) of the railway here. I went along, he provided 
some good herb wine, his wife was 'delaighted', and as I was 
leaving, he thanked me 'for doing him such an honour'. 
I have a debt of honour—£10—to settle with Mr Wheeler, a 
member of our COUNCIL b and MANAGER of the EMPIRE INSURANCE 
CORPORATION. YOU would oblige me greatly if you would send him 
the money on my  behalf:  'G. Wheeler, Esq., 27 Gresham Street, 
E.C. PRIVATE (London). I am also very much afraid that my family 
in London may be 'in profundis'.' This grieves me the more 
particularly because poor good little Jenny's birthday is May 1st. I 
have cast out nets with a view to making a monetary haul. With 
what success remains to be seen. 
My health is extraordinarily improved. No trace of the old 
complaint. What is more, in good spirits, despite all adversity, and 
no liver trouble.

ENGELS TO MARX 101 
IN HANOVER 
Manchester, 27 April 1867 
Dear Moor, 
I have received both your letters, the second yesterday 
afternoon, and would have replied to your first long before, if I 
had known where to. Firstly, BUSINESS. I am sending £10 to your 
wife,  who wrote to me this morning, and likewise the other £10 to 
Wheeler at the beginning of next month. This will give you some 
peace of mind in that regard, and, from what you write, the 
future also looks rosier at last. I always had the feeling that that 
damn book," which you have been carrying for so long, was at the 
bottom of all your misfortune, and you would and could never 
extricate yourself until you had got it off your back. Forever 
resisting completion, it was driving you physically, mentally and 
financially into the ground, and I can very well understand that, 
having shaken off that nightmare, you now feel quite a new man, 
especially as, once you have got back into it again, the world 
doesn't seem so gloomy a place as it did before. Especially when 
you have such a capital publisher as Meissner appears to be. 
Incidentally, a quick printing will only be possible, I fear, if you 
can remain in the vicinity throughout, i.e., on the continent; 
Capital

Holland would also be near enough for the purpose. I do not 
believe the Leipzig proof-readers will have enough learning for 
your approach. Meissner also got Wigand to print my pamphlet," 
and the things those wretches corrected into it! I am convinced 
that the book will create a real stir from the moment it appears, 
but it will be very necessary to help the enthusiasm of the 
scientifically-inclined burghers and officials on to its feet and 
not to despise petty stratagems. There is much that can be done to 
that end from Hanover after publication, and you could also enlist 
to advantage the support of amicus 0 Siebel, who is at the moment 
en route back from Madeira via England, in the best of spirits, as 
he says. This will be necessary vis-à-vis the vulgar scribbling 
fraternity, of whose deep-seated hatred for us we have proof 
enough. Furthermore, thick, scholarly works are always slow to 
make their mark without such assistance, but with it they act like 
'wildfire'—confer" Heraclitus the Dark, d etc.423  On this occasion, 
however, we must be all the more assiduous in ensuring this is 
done, as money is also at stake. Meissner will then be happy to take 
the collected essays, which would mean more money and further 
literary success. The pieces from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, the 
T8th Brumaire', c etc., will make an enormous impression on the 
philistines just now, and once we have gained a little more ground 
on that basis, all manner of other lucrative possibilities will soon 
present themselves, too. I am exceedingly gratified by this whole 
turn of events, firstly, for its own sake, secondly, for your sake in 
particular and your wife's, and, thirdly, because it really is time 
things looked up. In 2 years my CONTRACT with that swine 
Gottfried f expires, and the way things are going here, neither of 
us will really be wishing to extend it; it is even not impossible that 
our ways may part even earlier. If that should be so, I shall have 
to leave COMMERCE entirely, for to start up a business of my own at 
this late stage would mean 5-6 years of the most fearful drudgery 
with nothing worth speaking of to show for it, and then another 
5-6 years of drudgery to reap the benefits of the first 5 years. But 
that would be the end of me. There is nothing I long for so much 
as for release from this vile COMMERCE, which is completely 
demoralising me with all the time it is wasting. For as long as I am 
in it, I am good for nothing else, especially since I have become 
principal it has been much aggravated on account of the greater

responsibility. If it were not for the increased remuneration, I 
really would rather be a clerk again. At all events, in a few years 
my life as a businessman will come to an end, and then my income 
will be very, very much reduced, and the question of what we can 
do then has always been in my mind. However, if things go as 
they are now beginning to, we shall be able to make provision for 
that all right, too, even if no revolution intervenes and puts an 
end to all financial schemes. If that does not happen, I have a 
plan up my sleeve to have a fling for my deliverance and write a 
light-hearted book entitled: Woes and Joys of the English Bourgeoisie. 
I cannot go along with Meissner's suggestion.3  À few sheets  could 
be quickly knocked together, but something longer, 6 à 10 sheets, 
would require more work and be too late for the war now 
brewing. 415 One really cannot just knock together rubbish in the 
manner of Vogt's Studien.h  Furthermore, the stuff would be looked 
upon more or less as a party manifesto, and for that we would 
have to discuss the matter first. However, I have had an 
anti-Russian piece in mind for some time, and, if events provide 
me with an excuse, I shall start on it without more ado and write 
to Meissner. The only thing I am still in two minds about is 
whether I should make the 'nationality principle' 424 or the 'Eastern 
Question' the chief theme. 
I had expected that Bismarck would come knocking at your 
door, although not his haste.' It is characteristic of the fellow's 
mentality and outlook that he judges everybody by his own 
standards. The bourgeoisie may well admire the great men of 
today, it sees itself reflected in them. All the qualities to which 
Bonaparte and Bismarck owe their successes are the qualities of 
businessman: the pursuit of a specific purpose by a policy of 
wait-and-see and experimentation, until they hit the right moment, 
the diplomacy of always leaving the back door open, negotiating 
and haggling, swallowing insults if it is in one's interest, the 
attitude of 'ne soyons pas larrons '? in short, the businessman in all 
things. In his own way, Gottfried Ermen is as great a statesman as 
Bismarck, and, if one follows the tricks of these great men, one is 
constantly reminded of the Manchester Exchange. Bismarck 
thinks, if I only continue knocking at Marx's door, I am bound to 
hit upon the right moment eventually, and then we shall do a deal 
together after all. Gottfried Ermen to a tee.

I would not have expected the Prussians to be so hated there. 
But how do you reconcile that with the election results? Those 
jackasses from the National Association 152 did get half their men 
through, and in Electoral Hesse all but one. 
Vogt has got a life-size portrait of himself in the Gartenlaube* 
He has become a proper porker in the last few years, and looks 
fine. 
In the Demokratische Studien, which recently came my way, Simon 
of Trier has quite naively copied out whole pages from Po and 
Rhine, b without suspecting from what poisoned source he was 
drawing!c  Similarly, in 'Preussen in Waffen', the lieutenant who 
writes the military articles in Unsere Zeit has borrowed at length 
from my pamphlet, d likewise without giving his sources, of course. 
Rüstow will stop at nothing to become a Prussian general, as 
though that could be as easily done as with Garibaldi. In his 
abysmal and slipshod book on the war, 6 he grovels in optima forma1 
before William the Conqueror and the Prince.8 That's why he is 
moving to Berlin. 
I saw Ernest Jones the other day, he has had enquiries from 4 
places about standing for election under the new  BILL425—from 
Manchester as well. Has not a good word to say for the workers 
here  AND  BACKS  THE  PRUSSIANS  AT ANY  ODDS  AGAINST  THE  FRENCH. I hope this 
wretched war passes over, I cannot see that any good can come of 
it. A French revolution saddled in advance with the obligation to 
go a-conquering would be very nasty; it almost seems as though 
Bonaparte would be satisfied with the tiniest tit-bit, but whether 
the Lord of Hosts will permit handsome William to grant him 
even that tit-bit, time alone will show.

MARX TO SIGFRID MEYER 426 
IN NEW YORK 
Hanover, 30 April 1867 
Dear Friend, 
You must think very badly of me, and all the more so when I 
tell you that your letters did not merely give me great pleasure but 
were a real comfort to me since they reached me at a time of 
great affliction. The knowledge that a capable man, à la hauteur des 
principes,* has been won for our party, is some compensation to me 
for the worst. Your letters were furthermore full of such warm 
friendship for me personally, and you will appreciate that I who 
am engaged in a most bitter struggle with the (official) world can 
least afford to underestimate such things. 
Why then did I not answer you? Because I was the whole time 
at death's door. I thus had to make use of every moment when I 
was capable of work to complete my book,b to which I have 
sacrificed my health, happiness, and family. I hope this explana­
tion suffices. I laugh at the so-called 'practical' men and their 
wisdom. If one wanted to be an ox, one could, of course, turn 
one's back on the sufferings of humanity and look after one's own 
hide.  But I should really have thought myself unpractical if I had 
pegged out without finally completing my book, at least in 
manuscript. 
The first volume of the book will be published by Otto Meissner in 
Hamburg in a few weeks. The title of the work is: 'Capital. A 
Critique of Political Economy'. I travelled to Germany to bring over 
the manuscript, and I am spending a few days with a friend in 
Hanover c on my way back to London.412 
Volume I comprises the 'Process of Production of Capital'. As well 
as setting out the general theory, I examine in great detail the 
conditions of the English—agricultural and industrial — proletariat 
over the last 20  years,  ditto the condition of  Ireland,  basing myself on 
official sources that have never previously been used. You will 
immediately realise that all this serves me solely as an argumentum 
ad hominem?

I hope that  a year from  now the  whole work will have appeared. 
Volume  II contains  the  continuation  and  conclusion  of the  theory,

As to the  'International Working Men's Association',  it has

MARX  TO  LUDWIG BÜCHNER 427

Hanover,  1 May 1867 
(c/o Dr Kugelmann) 
Dear  Sir, 
Although  we are  entirely unacquainted,  I am  taking  the  liberty 
of addressing  a personal letter  to you, on a  personal, although  at 
the same time scientific, matter;  and I  hope  you  will excuse  my so 
doing  on account  of the  confidence  you  inspire  in me as a man of 
science  and of the  party. 
I have come  to Germany  to deliver  the  first volume  of my  work 
'Capital.  A Critique  of Political Economy'  to my  publisher,  Mr  Otto 
Meissner  in Hamburg.  I have  to stay here  a few  days longer  to see

if it will be possible for the printing to be done as quickly as Mr 
Meissner intends, viz., whether the proof-readers are sufficiently 
learned for such a mode of operation. 
The reason I am writing to you personally is this: I should like 
to have the thing published in French as well, in Paris, after its 
publication in Germany. I cannot go there  myself,  at least not 
without risk, as I have been expelled from France, first under 
Louis Philippe and a second time under Louis Bonaparte 
(President), 428 and finally I have been ceaselessly attacking Mr 
Louis during my exile in London. I cannot therefore go personally 
to seek out a translator. I know that your work on 'Stoff und 
Kraft' 3 has appeared in French, and therefore suppose that you 
can put me in touch, directly or indirectly, with a suitable person. 
As I have to prepare the second volume for printing this summer 
and the concluding third volume418 next winter, I do not have the 
time to attend to the French version of the book429  myself. 
I consider it to be of the greatest importance to emancipate the 
French from the erroneous views under which Proudhon with his 
idealised petty bourgeoisie has buried them. At the recent 
congress in Geneva,375 ditto in the links that I have with the Paris 
branch as a member of the General Council of the International 
Working Men's Association, I am constantly confronted with 
Proudhonism's most repugnant consequences. 
As I do not know for how long I shall be staying here, I should 
be obliged to you for an early answer. If I, for my part, can be of 
any service to you in London, I shall do so with the greatest 
pleasure. 
Yours most respectfully

MARX TO HIS DAUGHTER JENNY 
IN LONDON 
Hanover, 5 May 1867 
My dear Child, 
Your letter gave me the greatest pleasure. It is written in the 
true Imperial style.3 I hope to find you plump and fresh like a 
May rose. 
The enclosed photograph was to be sent to you for your 
birthday, but was not ready. It is backed by the photograph of 
Mme Tenge (by-the-by, the aunt of the Baer's girl, of whom 
Edgar b told us so much), who, however, is not so beautiful in 
reality as her shadow indicates. But she is a really noble nature, of 
a peculiar suavity, frankness and simplicity of character. Nothing 
of 'falsche Bildung'.' She speaks English, French and Italian (she is 
of Italian descent) perfectly. Although a great musician, she does 
not kill one with Kunstgeschwäts, d which, on the contrary, she 
abhors. She is an atheist and inclines to Socialism, although rather 
little informed on that point. What distinguishes her above all is a 
spontaneous kindness and the absence of all pretensions. I feel 
sure you would in no time become very intimate friends. Mrs 
Kugelmann is also a nice little woman. 
To-day, on my birthday, I receive the first 'Bogen' e for revision. 
I fear the book will become rather a little too big. In consequence 
of the Easter week business, the printing did not commence before 
29th April, Meissner growing very wild at this suspense. Mean­
while, time has not been lost. Preliminary notices have been 
published almost in all German papers. Kugelmann has very many 
connections, which were all put into motion. 
Your birthdayf was solemnly celebrated here. 
Except part of the bourgeoisie, lawyers and such ones, there 
reigns here at Hanover a fanatical hatred of the Prussians, which 
much amuses me. 
I was very glad to hear of your Polish surprise. If the things 
have no mercantile value, they have a historical one.430

long as it remains at the head of England, Russia will not (sound 
the war signal—a phrase, by-the-by, which is conceived in the true 
colletian style. 
I cannot exactly state the day of my return. I have still to receive 
letters from different sides. I shall return directly from here via 
Hamburg (there to have another interview with my publishera) to 
London. 
I had, very soon after my arrival here, written to Liebknecht. 111 
He has answered. His wifeb cannot be saved. She is approaching 
the catastrophe. She sends her compliments to you all and was 
cheered up by your letters.

First, BUSINESS. That damned Wigand did not start printing 3 until 
29 April, so that I received the first sheet for correction the day 
before yesterday, on my birthday. Post tot pericula!h  The misprints 
were relatively insignificant. It's impossible to wait here until the 
printing is completed. In the first instance, I fear that the book 
will prove much fatter than I had originally calculated. Second, I 
am not getting the manuscript back, so that for many quotations, 
especially those involving figures or Greek, I need to have my 
home manuscript to hand, nor can I impose on Dr Kugelmann's 
hospitality for too long. Finally, Meissner is demanding the 2nd 
volume by the end of the autumn at the latest. I shall therefore 
have to get my nose to the grindstone as soon as possible, as a lot 
of new material relating especially to the chapters on credit and 
landed property has become available since the manuscript was 
composed. The third volume must be completed during the 
winter, so that I shall have shaken off the whole opus by next 
spring. 418 The business of writing, of course, is quite different 
once the proofs for what has already been done start coming in à 
fur et mesure," and under PRESSURE from the publisher. 
Meanwhile, my time here has not been wasted. Letters have 
been written to all and sundry, and preliminary notices have 
appeared in most German papers. 
I hope and confidently believe that in the space of a year I shall 
be made, in the sense that I shall be able to fundamentally rectify 
my financial affairs and at last stand on my own feet again. 
Without you, I would never have been able to bring the work to a 
conclusion, and I can assure you it always weighed like a 
nightmare on my conscience that you were allowing your fine 
energies to be squandered and to rust in commerce, chiefly for my 
sake,  and, INTO THE BARGAIN, that you had to share all my petites 
misères d as well. On the other hand, I cannot conceal from myself 
that I still have a year  OF TRIAL ahead of me. I have taken a step on 
which a great deal depends, viz., on which it depends whether 
several £100 will be made available to me from the only quarter 
where that is possible. There is a tolerable prospect of a positive 
outcome, but I shall remain uncertain for  ABOUT  6 weeks. I shall 
not have definite confirmation until then. What I am most afraid 
of—apart from the uncertainty—is my return to London, which 
will be necessary in 6-8 days. My debts there are considerable, and

the Manichaeans431 are 'urgently' awaiting my return. And then 
the torments of family life, the domestic conflicts, the constant 
harassment, instead of settling down to work refreshed and free of 
care. 
Dr Kugelmann and his wife 11 are being exceptionally kind to me 
and anticipate my every need. They are splendid people. They 
really leave me no time to explore 'the gloomy paths of my inner 
self.  Apropos, the Bismarck affair must be kept absolutely secret.b 
I promised to tell no one, not even Kugelmann, about it. Nor have 
I done so. I did, however, of course make the reservatio mentalis to 
except  yourself. 
You express surprise that the National-Liberals432  (or, as 
Kugelmann calls them, the Europeans) did so well in the elections, c 
when the Prussians are so hated here. The matter is very simple. 
They did badly in all the larger towns, in smaller places they owed 
their victories to their organisation, which has existed ever since 
Gotha. 433 These fellows do, on the whole, show how important 
party organisation is. That is the position in Hanover. In Electoral 
Hesse, there is no limit to the influence of Prussian intimidation, 
backed up by the shouting of the members of the National 
Association. 152 The Prussians meanwhile are operating quite in the 
Persian manner here. It is true that they cannot transplant the 
population to their Eastern provinces, but they are doing so with 
their officials, right down to the RAILWAY conductors, and for the 
officers. Even those poor devils of postmen are having to move to 
Pomerania. In the meantime, trains full of Hessians, Hanoverians, 
etc., are to be seen on the railway every day en route to Bremen, 
emigrating to the United States. Not since dear old Germany came 
into existence has it sent such a motley crowd of people from all 
parts across the Atlantic. One is trying to avoid his taxes, another, 
his military service, a third the political situation, and all of them 
the hegemony of the sword and the gathering storm of war. 
I am greatly diverted by the (pro-Prussian) bourgeoisie here. 
They want war, but immédiatement.' 1 Business, they say, can stand 
the uncertainty no longer, and where the devil are the taxes to 
come from if business stagnates for much longer? Incidentally, 
you would scarcely conceive the burden that the last war and 
taxation have imposed upon the rural populace in Prussia. Here in 
the vicinity of Prussian Westphalia, e.g., truly Irish conditions 
prevail.

here (manufacturing chiefly water and gas pipes) conducted me 
round the works. On the whole, it is very well organised and 
utilises much quite modern equipment. But, on the other hand, 
there is still a good deal of turning by hand (detail work), where 
the English and Scots are using automatic machinery. The same 
director took me into the Hermann's-column workshop. The thing 
is as long in the making as Germany  itself.  Hermann's head is so 
colossal that you'd seem like a child beside it, and it has a fine look 
of honest stupidity, and Mr Arminius was above all a diplomat. 
His air of worthy Westphalian simplicity served but as a mask for 
a most subtle mind. As chance would have it, I had renewed my 
acquaintance with Mr Arminius, shortly before my departure from 
London, in the Grimm edition of historical sources" with which 
you are familiar. 
I am sure you will recall J. Meyer (at Bielefeld), who refused to 
print our manuscript on Stirner, etc.,b  and sent the youth Kriege 
to annoy us? 434 A few months ago he threw himself out of the 
window in Warsaw, whither his business affairs had taken him, 
and broke his neck, if you please. 
Our friend Miquel, who declared himself prepared to sacrifice 
freedom so readily for the sake of unity, is believed to be 
job-hunting. In my view, le brave homme' has miscalculated. Had 
he not hurled himself so fanatically and unconditionally at 
Bismarck's feet, he would have been able to pick up a generous 
gratuity. But now! What need is there for that? He has made 
himself so hated by his performance in the North German 
Parliament 435 that he is chained to the Prussians like one convict to 
the next. And the Prussians, as you know, do not like to make 
'useless' and superfluous dépenses? Recently, the Bismarckite 
newspaper, the Norddeutsche Allgemeine, produced by that scoun­
drel Brass published a very witty article e about the National-
Associationites, pleading inability to emulate even the de mortuis nil 
nisi bene? It sent Bismarck's North-German-Confederationite, 
National-Associationite minions packing with some artistic kicks 
delivered con amore. s 
As far as the war is concerned, I am entirely of your opinion. At 
the present moment, it can only do harm. If it could be delayed, even

just for a year, that would be worth its weight in gold to us. In the 
first place, Bonaparte and William the Conqueror3  would neces­
sarily be made to look foolish. The opposition is reviving in 
Prussia (its only press organ just now is Die Zukunft in Berlin, 
founded by Jacobi b), and events may occur in France. Business is 
becoming more and more stagnant, and it will then be impossible 
to cover up the suffering there on the Continent with empty 
phrases, whether they be of teutonic or gallic provenance. 
In my view, we owe the postponement of war exclusively to the 
Derby ministry. It is anti-Russian, and Russia dares not give the 
signal until she is sure of Britain. Gladstone, THE PHRASEMONGER 
(entirely under the influence of  LADY  Palmerston, Shaftesbury, 
and LORD  Cowper), and Bright, not forgetting Russell, would 
gladly provide her with the guarantees that Britain was disposed 
as recjuired. Derby had to be removed in 1859, too, in order to 
stage the Great Drama in Italy.c In the North German Parliament 
Bismarck was obliged to throw down the gauntlet to the Poles in 
the most brutal manner416 and thus declare his total subservience 
to the Tsard. 
In the Prussian army there prevails deep distrust of the Russians 
amongst the better officers, as I learnt personally from Captain 
von Bölzig here (Guards Regiment, raised in the Cadet Corps, 
loyal to the Prussian monarchy, but a nice fellow). 'Bismarck's 
conduct in North Schleswig is incomprehensible to me. Only the 
Russians,' this he said quite unprompted, 'have any interest in 
maintaining tension between ourselves and Denmark.' He went on 
to call Frederick William IV a 'shady cavalier', who had turned 
Germany into Russia's lackey for '/a century. The Russian officers 
were 'shitty fellows', the army good for nothing, except for the 
Guards Regiments, Austria alone was capable of matching the 
Russian army, etc. I also put a good many more ideas into his 
head about the Muscovites. 
And now adio. Kindest regards to  MRS  Lizzy.e

223 
MARX TO LAURA MARX 
IN LONDON 
Hanover, 13 May 1867 
My pretty little Cacadou," 
My best thanks for your letter, and that of the worthy Quoquo.b 
You complain that I had given no signs of life, but on reviewing 
the question you will find that, on the whole, I have given weekly 
signals. Moreover, you know that I am not of a very 'demonstra­
tive' character, of rather retiring habitudes, a slow writer, a clumsy 
sort of man or, as Quoquo has it, an anxious man. 
I shall leave Hanover the day after to-morrow, and probably 
leave Hamburg by first steamer for London. Yet, you must not 
expect me to settle the day and the hour. I have still some business 
to transact with my publisher.' At all events, this is the last week of 
my continental stay.412 
I am very glad that my photogramm has met with such good 
reception. The shadow is at all events less troublesome than the 
original. 
As to Mrs Tenge, I wonder that you ask me how she looks, 
whether she is pretty? I have sent Jenny her photogramm, hidden 
behind my own. How could it have been lost? Now, to answer 
your questions, she is 33 years of age, mother of 5 children, rather 
interesting than pretty, and certainly no professional wit. But she 
is a superior woman. As to 'flirting', he would be rather a bold man 
who were to try it. As to 'admiration', I owe it, and there may, 
perhaps, have been on her side, some overestimation of your most 
humble and 'modest' master. You know, if no one is a prophet on 
his own dunghill (speaking symbolically), people are easily 
overvalued by strangers who, legen sie nicht aus, so legen sie doch

Eight days since, the weather was still frosty and rainy. Now 
summer has at once burst into full bloom. On the whole, the

These continentals have an easier life of it than we on the other 
side of the Northern sea. With 2,000 Thalers (300£) you can live 
here most comfortably. For inst., there exist here different 
gardens (à la Cremourn, 436 but 'respectable', and where all sort of 
people meet), much more artistically arranged than any in 
London, good music being played every evening, etc., where you 
can subscribe for self and family—for the whole year—at the 
price of 2 Thalers, 6 sh.! This is only a specimen of the cheap life 
the Philister indulge in at this place. Young people amuse 
themselves more freely and at almost no expense, comparatively 
speaking. There is of course one great drawback—the atmosphere 
is pregnant with dullness. The standard of existence is too small. 
It is a lot of pygmées amongst whom you want no very high frame 
to feel like Gulliver amidst the Lilliputians. 
There arrive this morning rather 'excited' letters from Berlin. It 
seems that a collision between the workmen and the Pickelhauben* 
is apprehended. I do not expect much for the present, but there is 
something brewing. The working class, in the greater centres of 
Germany, are commencing to assume a more decided and 
threatening attitude. One fine morning there will be a nice dance!

Dear FRED, 
Arrived in London Sunday.3 Got here today.437 But: 
Notice: with me one H. Meyer from St Louis, whom I am about 
to collect from the railway  REFRESHMENT  ROOM,  where I deposited him, 
and I am going to deposit him here in the NEIGHBOURHOOD, Star. 
He was Weydemeyer's last compagnon at his death and took his 
wife (Weydemeyer's wife), who was also mourante, h away from St 
Louis to friends and gave her support. Came to me with a 
recommendation from Jacobic (New York). 
This Meyer, who is travelling to Germany, came to England  solely 
to visit us both. He arrived yesterday. I was not at home. My wife 
told him that I would be travelling to Manchester today to visit 
you. 
These HINTS will be sufficient to explain to you how it comes 
about that he accompanied me on the journey here. He will only 
be staying here 2 days. AT  FIRST  I was vexed. But for Weydemeyer's 
sake!  This Meyer is a fine, active fellow. However,  COOKS  slowly and 
somewhat boring.

DEAR FRED, 
The reason  why  sheets  10 and 11 are not  being sent  to you, 
indeed  why no  more proofs3  at all, you  will discover from  the 
enclosed note from Wigand.  On the  other hand,  you  will receive 
the first  5 pulls that have been sent  to me. You can  keep 
them  ABOUT  8-10  days,  but  then  you  must  let me  know exactly 
which points  in the  exposition  of the  form  of  value  you  think 
should  be  specially popularised  for the  philistines  in the  supple­
ment.438

See the  Hermann  of  last week.  It is now the  private herald  of Mr

such  a thing,  she  would publicly proclaim  him her  non-father. 
Whereupon Lafargue asked  her:  Mais qu'est-ce  que  votre mère dirait 
là-dessus? h The  noble poet'  is incidentally  sly  enough  to declare 
already that  he  will have  to remain  in London  on  account  of his

IN HANOVER 
London, 10 June 1867 
Dear Friend, 
The delay attending this letter will expose me to the more or 
less 'well-founded suspicion' of being a 'bad fellow'. The sole 
extenuating circumstance I can plead is that I have only been 
'resident' in London for the last few days. In the interval I was 
visiting Engels in Manchester. 437 But I am sure you and your dear 
wife a now know me sufficiently to realise that epistolary negli­
gence is the rule with me. Nevertheless, my thoughts were with you 
every day. I count my stay in Hanover among the most splendid 
and refreshing oases in life's desert.412 
My stay in Hamburg was uneventful, except that, despite all 
precautions, I made the acquaintance of Mr Wilhelm Marr. In 
respect of his personal manner, he is Lassalle translated to 
Christianity, but there is naturally far less to him. Mr Niemann 
was also performing in the few days I spent there. However, I had 
been too spoiled by the society in Hanover to wish to attend a 
theatrical performance in less good company. Mr Niemann thus 
escaped me. 
Apropos. Meissner is willing to print the medical pamphlet you 
are planning. You need only send him the manuscript and 
mention my name. Regarding the precise conditions, you will have 
to negotiate the rest with him  yourself. 
The crossing from Hamburg to London was by and large fair, if 
one discounts somewhat raw weather on the first day. A few hours

before we reached London, a young German lady, who had 
already caught my attention by her military bearing, announced 
that she intended travelling from London to Weston supra Mare 
the same evening" and did not know how she should set about it 
with all her considerable luggage. The casus was all the more 
problematical as helping hands are hard to come by in England on 
the Sabbath. I got her to show me the name of the railway station 
to which she was to proceed in London. Friends had written it 
down on a card. It was the NORTH WESTERN STATION, which was on my 
way as well. I therefore chivalrously offered to set the young lady 
down there. Agreed. On further reflection, however, it occurred 
to me that Weston supra Mare lay to the south-west, whereas the 
STATION which I was to pass and which had been written down for 
the young lady was north-west. I consulted the SEA-CAPTAIN. Correct: 
it appeared she should be deposited in a quite different part of 
London from my own. However, I was now committed and had to 
assume bonne mine à mauvais jeu. b We arrived at 2 o'clock in the 
afternoon.. I took la donna errante" to her STATION, where I learned 
that her train did not leave until 8 o'clock in the evening. So, I  WAS 
IN FOR  IT, and had 6 hours to kill with Mademoiselle, walking in 
Hyde Park, sitting in ICE-SHOPS, etc. It emerged that her name was 
Elisabeth von Puttkamer, a niece of Bismarck's, as whose guest she 
had just spent several weeks in Berlin. She had the whole army list 
by heart, this family providing our 'gallant regiments' with stout 
hearts and true in super-abundance. She was a cheerful, educated 
girl, but aristocratic and black and white d to her finger-tips. She 
was not a little astonished when she learned that she had fallen 
into 'red' hands. I reassured her, however, that our encounter 
would pass 'without bloodshed' and saw her depart saine et sauve e 
for her destination. Just think what fodder that would provide for 
Blind or other vulgar democrats—my CONSPIRACY WITH Bismarck! 
Today I despatched the 14th corrected proof-sheet.f  I received 
the majority of them while staying with Engels, who is exceedingly 
pleased with them and, except for sheets 2 and 3, finds them 
written in a manner very easy to understand. I was reassured by 
his verdict, as I am always very dissatisfied with my things when I 
see them printed, especially at first sight. 
Please convey my special thanks to your dear wife once more for 
her warm and friendly welcome to me; I am sending her the

ENGELS TO MARX 101 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 16 June 1867 
Dear Moor, 
I have been so distracted by all manner of bother with Monsieur 
Gottfriedc and other suchlike affairs and disturbances for the past 
week that I seldom had the leisure to study the form of value. 
Otherwise, I would have sent the sheetsd back to you long ago. 
Sheet 2 in particular has the marks of your carbuncles rather 
firmly stamped upon it, but there is not much that can be done 
about it now and I think you should not deal with it any further in 
the supplement, as your philistine really is not accustomed to this 
kind of abstract thinking and will certainly not torment himself for 
the sake of the form of value. At most, you could provide rather 
more extensive historical evidence for the conclusions you have 
here reached dialectically, you could, so to speak, apply the test of 
history, although you have already made the most essential points 
in that respect; but you have so much material that you can surely 
still write quite a good excursus on it, which will by historical

means demonstrate to the philistine the need for the development 
of money and the process by which this takes place. 
It was a serious mistake not to have made the development of 
these rather abstract arguments clearer by means of a larger 
number of short sections with their own headings. You ought to 
have treated this part in the manner of Hegel's Encyclopaedia,3 
with short paragraphs, each dialectical transition emphasised by 
means of a special heading and, as far as possible, all the excurses 
or merely illustrative material printed in special type. The thing 
would have looked somewhat like a school text-book, but a very 
large class of readers would have found it considerably easier to 
understand. The populus, even the scholars, just are no longer at 
all accustomed to this way of thinking, and one has to make it as 
easy for them as one possibly can. 
Compared with your earlier presentation (Duncker),b the 
dialectic of the argument has been greatly sharpened, but with 
regard to the actual exposition there are a number of things I like 
better in the first version. It is a great pity that the carbuncles 
have left their mark on the important second sheet in particular. 
However, there is nothing to be done about it now, and those who 
are capable of thinking dialectically will understand it, neverthe­
less. The other sheets are very good, and I was delighted by them. 
I hope you will soon be able to send me another five or six sheets 
(and could you please enclose sheet 5 again so that I can pick up 
the thread properly); the sheets I have been reading one by one 
here will make a much better impression when read together. 
I've discovered a few more misprints. I would only list as errata 
those which really distort the sense. 
I called on Gumpert yesterday. Pauvre garçon!' He is deteriorat­
ing with each day that passes. It was impossible to arouse his 
interest in anything scientific or even political. Town gossip and 
nothing more than town gossip. And yet he cannot understand 
why people don't call oh him more often. 
Have read Hofmann.d For all its faults, the latest chemical 
theory does represent a great advance on the old atomistic theory. 
The molecule as the smallest part of matter capable of independent 
existence is a perfectly rational category, a 'nodal point',441 as Hegel 
calls it, in the infinite progression of subdivisions, which does not 
terminate it, but marks a qualitative change. The atom — formerly

represented as the limit of divisibility—is now but a state, although 
Monsieur Hofmann himself is forever relapsing into the old idea 
that indivisible atoms really exist. For the rest, the advances in 
chemistry that this book records are truly enormous, and 
Schorlemmer says that this revolution is still going on day by day, 
so that new upheavals can be expected daily.

MARX TO ENGELS 101 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 22 June 1867 
Dear FRED, 
Herewith 4 more sheets5 enclosed for you which reached me 
yesterday. The fellows have left a number of misprints that I 
corrected perfectly legibly. One error we corrected in ourselves 
was 'CHILDRENS' EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION', CHILDRENS'. For CHILDREN is 
nominative pluralis, genitive mark is'. I saw it at once when I had 
another look at the BLUE  BOOKS  3M myself. 
King has written to say that the Fenians4*9 are not yet out. They 
are postponing it for as long as possible and as near to the close of 
the SESSION  as possible. 
I hope you are satisfied with the 4 sheets. That you have been 
satisfied with it so far is more important to me than ANYTHING the 
rest of the world  MAY  SAY OF IT. At all events, I hope the bourgeoisie 
will remember my carbuncles until their dying day. Here is a fresh 
a Paul Lafargue (an allusion to his inclination to use electricity in medicine) - b of the 
first volume of Capital 

=====第422页=====
384 228. Marx  to Engels.  22 June  1867 
sample  of what swine they  are! You  know that  the  CHILDREN'S 
EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION has been  at work  for 5  years  now.  When  its 
first report appeared  in 1863, the  industries  it exposed were  at 
once 'called  to order'.  At the  beginning  of this session  the  Tory 
ministry introduced  a BILL per Walpole,  THE  WEEPING  WILLOW,  accepting 
all the  Commission's proposals, though  on a  very reduced scale. 
The fellows  who  were  to be  called  to order, among them  the big 
metal manufacturers,  and  especially  the  vampires  of 'domestic 
industry', maintained  a cowardly silence. Now they  are presenting  a 
petition  to Parliament  and  demanding—a  New  Enquiryl  The old 
one, they  say, was  biassed! They  are  counting  on the  Reform 
Bill 425 taking  up the  public's entire attention,  so that  the  thing 
would  be cosily  and  PRIVATELY smuggled through,  at the  very time 
that the  TRADE UNIONS  are having  a rough passage.442  The  worst 
things about  the  REPORTS  are the  fellows'  own  statements. They  are 
well aware that  a new  enquiry means  one  thing only,  and  that  is 
precisely 'what  we  bourgeois want'—a  new  5-year lease  for 
exploitation. Fortunately,  my  position  in the  'INTERNATIONAL' enables 
me to frustrate those curs' little game.  It is a  matter  of the  utmost 
importance. What  is at  stake  is the  abolition  of torture  for 
l'/ä million people, not including the  ADULT  MALE  WORKINGMEN! 443 
With regard  to the  development  of the  form  of value,  I have both 
followed  and not  followed your advice, thus striking  a dialectical 
attitude  in this matter,  too.  That  is to say, 1. I  have written  an 
appendix  in which  I set out the  same subject again  as simply  and as 
much  in the  manner  of a  school text-book  as possible,  and 2. I 
have divided each successive proposition into paras,  etc.,  each with 
its own  heading,  as you  advised.  In the  Preface  I then tell  the 
'non-dialectical' reader  to skip page  x-y and  instead read  the 
appendix.438  It is not  only  the  philistines that  I have  in mind here, 
but young people,  etc., who are  thirsting  for knowledge. Anyway, 
the issue  is crucial  for the  whole book.  The  economists have 
hitherto overlooked  the  very simple fact that  the  equation  20 yards 
of linen  = 1 coal  is but the  primitive form  of 20  yards  of linen=£2, 
and thus that  the  simplest form  of a  commodity,  in which  its value  is 
not yet  expressed  in its  relation  to all  other commodities  but  only 
as something differentiated from  its own  natural form, embodies  the 
whole secret  of the money form  and  thereby,  in nuce,"  of all bourgeois 
forms  of the product  of labour.  In my  first presentation (Duncker),b  I 
avoided  the  difficulty  of the  development  by not  actually analysing

the" way value is expressed until it appears as its developed form, as 
expressed in money. 
You are quite right about Hofmann.3  Incidentally, you will see 
from the conclusion to my Chapter III, where I outline the 
transformation of the master of a trade into a capitalist—as a 
result of purely quantitative changes—that in the text there I quote 
Hegel's discovery of the law of the transformation of a merely 
quantitative change into a qualitative one as being attested by history 
and natural science alike. In the note to the text (I was as it 
happened attending Hofmann's lectures at that time) I mention 
the molecular  theory,  but not Hofmann, who has discovered nothing 
in the matter except contributing general direction; instead I do 
mention Laurent, Gerhardt and Wurtz, the latter being the real 
man. 444 Your letter struck a faint chord in my memory, and I 
therefore looked up my manuscript. 
Printing has proceeded slowly in the last two weeks (only 4 
sheets), probably on account of Whitsun. But Mr O. Wigand will 
have to make up for this lost time. Apropos. Your bookb is still 
available. The Workers' Associationc has ordered and been sent 2 
NEW COPIES from O. Wigand. (2nd impression 1848.445) 
Now for private matters. 
My children are obliged to invite some other girls for dancing 
on 2 July, as they have been unable to invite anyone for the whole 
of this year, to respond to invitations, and are therefore about  TO 
I.OSE CASTE. So, hard-pressed though I am at the moment, I had to 
agree to it and am counting on you for the wine (claret and 
Rhenish), i.e. on your supplying me with it in the course of next 
week. 
Secondly, as 'misfortunes' never come singly, Linad has an­
nounced her arrival for next week. My wife will then have to 
return to her the £5 which she owes her, and you will understand 
that after fending off the first wave of creditors, I cannot AFFORD 
that. 
I am in fact exceedingly vexed with the people who have 
promised me money but have not sent word (so far, at least). They 
have a personal interest in me. That I do know. They also know 
that I cannot continue my work unless I have a modicum of peace 
and quiet. And yet they have sent no word! 
Our 'noble' poet Freiligrath really is going to collect a tidy

ENGELS TO MARX 419 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 24 June 1867 
Dear Moor, 
Sheets'1 up to and incl. 12 received with thanks, though have not 
yet read beyond No. 8. Thus far, the chapters on the transformation 
of money into capital and the production of surplus-value 446 are the 
best, as far as presentation and content are concerned. Yesterday I 
did a rough translation of them for Moore, who understood them 
correctly and was most astonished that conclusions could be 
arrived at so simply. At the same time, I have solved the question 
of who should translate your book into English: Moore  himself. 
He has enough German now to read Heine fairly fluently and will 
soon work his way into your style (except for the form of value

Capital

and the terminology, where I shall have to give him considerable 
assistance). It is, of course, understood that the whole task will be 
performed under my immediate supervision. As soon as you have 
a publisher, who nota bene will pay him something for his work, he 
is quite ready to do it. The fellow is diligent and reliable, and, at 
the same time, has as much prior understanding of the theory as 
one can expect of an Englishman. I have told him that you would 
rewrite the analysis of commodities and the section on money in 
English  yourself.  For the rest, however, we also need a terminology 
(English) now to translate the Hegelian expressions, and you 
might be giving some thought to the matter in the meantime, as it 
is not easy, but there is no way round it. 
I have quite lost track of how many sheets have now in fact been 
type-set—it must surely be half the book by now, mustn't it? I am 
looking forward to the embarrassment of the economists when 
they reach the two above-mentioned passages. The development 
of the form of value is, of course, the quintessence of all the 
bourgeois trash, but the revolutionary consequences are not yet 
fully evident, and people can more easily get round these 
abstractions and confine themselves to clichés. But an end is put to 
that here, the issue is so crystal clear that I do not see what they 
can say to it. 
I hope you will succeed in tripping up our bourgeois gentlemen 
with their new Enquiry.442 Just a few days ago, I heard one of the 
iron-founders and engineering manufacturers bemoaning the 
impending danger. Meanwhile, it is very good that the Commis­
sion has permanently frustrated the Sheffield star-chamber 
organisation.447 It was precisely this local terrorism and its great 
success that deterred the fellows from joining the great national 
movement, and confirmed them in their parochialism. The cries 
of horror emanating from the bourgeoisie are comical. As though 
our bourgeois gentlemen had not had their own star-chambers, 
their VIGILANCE COMMITTEES in Australia and California, etc., which 
acted in exactly the same fashion, but claimed far more victims. 
I shall be sending you the wine, and another £10 before the end 
of this month. I would have preferred it if you had set a later date

Are there not old pre-Baconian, pre-Lockeian philosophical

exists.  And how about English attempts at reproducing Hegel?

ENGELS TO MARX 448 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 26 June 1867 
Dear Moor, 
'Pursuant to mine faithfully of yesterday', two half five-pound-
notes enclosed, whose 2nd halves will follow by 1st post early 
tomorrow morning and thus be in your possession tomorrow 
evening. 
With regard to the production of surplus-value, another point: 
the manufacturer, and with him the vulgar economist, will 
immediately interject: if the capitalist only pays the worker the 
price of 6 hours for his 12 hours' labour, no surplus-value can be 
produced, since in that case each hour of the factory worker's 
labour counts only='/2 an hour's labour,=the amount which has 
been paid for, and only that value can be embodied in the value of 
the labour product. Whereupon there will follow the usual 
formula by way of example: so much for raw materials, so much 
for wear and tear, so much for wages (wages actually paid per 
hour's actual product), etc. Atrociously superficial though this 
argument may be, however much it may equate exchange-value 

=====第427页=====
231. Marx to Engels. 27 June 1867 389 
with price, and value of labour with labour-wage, and absurd 
though its premiss may be that if for one hour's labour only half 
an hour is paid, then only V2 hour's worth goes into the value, I 
do, nevertheless, find it surprising that you have not already taken 
it into account, for you will most certainly be immediately 
confronted with this objection, and it is better to anticipate it. 
Perhaps you return to it in the following sheets. 
You must supply me with an address in London to which I can 
have the £100 sent next week. I am thinking of taking Lizzie3  via 
Grimsby to Hamburg, Schleswig, Copenhagen, etc., one week 
from now, and will probably be away for 4 weeks. 449 I shall 
therefore have to get our cashier to send the money there on 
Thursday or Friday, for which purpose I need a neutral address, if 
possible commercial. You must therefore consider whom you would 
prefer for this purpose, and let me know at once. 
When I have sent Lizzie back to Grimsby from Hamburg, I shall 
also go on to visit Meissner and Kugelmann, and then travel to the 
Rhine. 
Kindest regards.

Dear FRED, 
The 2 half £5-notes received with kindest thanks. With respect 
to the address, use Borkheim. He knows my situation, though with 
as much concealment as I consider necessary in his regard. I 
would even like him to know that you are lending me money. But 

=====第428页=====

you must write and tell me when the money is to be sent to him. I 
do not see why I should involve yet a 3rd philistine. 
The Fenians should be delivered to you today.439 
I was so very pleased by your lines of yesterday, and that 
requires no further elaboration from me. 
Sheet 20a was the latest to reach me. It will probably run to 40 
or 42 sheets in all. I've not as yet received any corrected proofs after 
the ones already sent you. On your departure send me back those 
which are in your possession. 
Regarding the objection that you mentioned the philistines and 
vulgar economists will infallibly raise (they forget, of course, that, 
if they reckon paid labour as wages, they are reckoning unpaid 
labour as profit, etc.), it amounts, in scientific terms, to the 
following question: 
How is the value of the commodity transformed into its price of 
production, in which 
1. the whole of the labour appears paid for in the form of wages; 
2. the surplus-labour, however, or the surplus-value, assumes 
the form of an addition to the price, and goes by the name of 
interest, profit, etc., over and above the cost-price (=price of the 
constant part of capital+wages). 
Answering this question presupposes: 
I. That the transformation of, for example, the value of a day's 
labour-power into wages or the price of a day's labour has been 
explained. This is done in Chapter V of this volume.450 
II. That the transformation of surplus-value into profit, and of 
profit into average profit, etc., has been explained. This presupposes 
that the process of the circulation of capital has been previously 
explained, since the turnover of capital, etc., plays a part here. 
This matter cannot therefore be treated prior to the 3rd book 
( Volume II is to contain books 2 and  3). 418 Here it will be shown 
how the philistines' and vulgar economists' manner of conceiving 
things arises, namely, because the only thing that is ever reflected 
in their minds is the immediate form of appearance of relations, and 
not their inner connection. Incidentally, if the latter were the case, 
we would surely have no need of science at all. 
Now if I wished to refute all such objections in advance, I should 
spoil the whole dialectical method of exposition. On the contrary, 
the good thing about this method is that it is constantly setting 
traps for those fellows which will provoke them into an untimely 
display of their idiocy.

By the by, Para. 3: 'The Rate of Surplus Value', which was the last 
one you had in your possession, is immediately followed by the 
Para.: 'The Working Day' (struggle for the reduction of working 
time),  whose argument demonstrates ad oculos* to what extent 
those bourgeois gentlemen comprehend the source and nature of 
their profit in practice. This is also shown in the Senior  CASE,  where 
your bourgeois assures us that his whole profit and interest derive 
from the last unpaid hour of  labour. 4:>1

DEAR FRED, 
The children send you their best thanks. 
I have written to Meissner today that the 'Leipzig' method 
cannot continue in this fashion. 111 I've had nothing since Monday. 
The proofs0 have been reaching me most irregularly throughout, 
so that I am for ever being interrupted in other work and am for 
ever kept quite pointlessly on tenterhooks. Having perhaps 
received 1 sheet in a whole week, on Saturday evening I at last get a 
successor which is too late for me to send off. I have written to

Meissner that Wigand must send a minimum of 3 sheets on certain 
agreed days, but that he is always welcome to send more at ANYTIME. 
If I get 13th and 14th sheets of the corrected copy in time, you 
shall have them on Sunday. I would have liked you to see my 
dressing-down of Senior and my introduction to the analysis of the 
working day 451 before your departure.449 Incidentally, the section 
on the 'Working Day' occupies 5 printed sheets, which do, of 
course, contain predominantly factual material. To show you how 
closely I have followed your advice in my treatment of the 
appendix,3 I'll now copy out for you the divisions, sections, 
headings, etc., of same appendix.438 
Appendix to Chapter I, 1 
The Form of Value 
I. Simple Form of Value 
§ 1. The two poles of the expression of value: relative form and 
equivalent form of value. 
a. Inseparability of the two forms. 
b. Polarity of the two forms. 
c. Relative value and equivalent, both being but forms of value. 
§ 2. The relative form of value. 
a. The relation of equality. 
b. Value-relations. 
c. Qualitative content of the relative form of value implied in 
value-relations. 
d. Quantitative determination of the relative form of value 
implied in value-relations. 
e. The relative form of value considered as a whole. 
§ 3. The equivalent form. 
a. The form of direct exchangeability. 
b. Quantitative determination not contained in  the equivalent  form. 
c. The peculiarities of the equivalent form. 
a. First peculiarity: use-value  becomes the  form of  appearance  of 
its opposite, value. 
ß. Second peculiarity: concrete labour becomes the form of 
appearance of its opposite, abstract human labour. 
a See this volume, p. 381. 

=====第431页=====
232. Marx to Engels. 27 June 1867 393 
7. Third peculiarity: private labour  takes the  form of  its opposite, 
namely, labour in its directly social form. 
Ô. Fourth peculiarity: the fetishism of the commodity-form more 
striking in the equivalent form than in the relative value-form. 
§ 4. The form of value or independent manifestation of value  = exchange 
value. 
§ 5. Simple form of value of the  commodity=  simple manifestation of 
the contradictions it contains within itself between use-value and value. 
§ 6. Simple form of value of the commodity = simple form of an  object 
as commodity. 
§ 7. Relationship between commodity-form and money-form. 
§ 8. Simple relative form of value and individual equivalent form. 
§ 9. Transition of the simple into the expanded form of value. 
II. Total or Expanded Form of Value 
§ 1. The endless series of relative expressions of value. 
§ 2. Sequential determination implied in the expanded relative form of 
value. 
§ 3. Defects of the expanded relative form of value. 
§ 4. Expanded relative form of value and specific equivalent form. 
§ 5. Transition to the general form of value. 
III. The General Form of Value 
§ 1. Altered character of the relative form of value. 
§ 2. Altered character of the equivalent form. 
§ 3. Concurrent development of relative form of value and equivalent 
form. 
§ 4. Development of the polarity between relative form of value and 
equivalent form. 
§ 5. Transition from the general form of value to the money-form. 
IV. The Money-Form 
(The following on the money-form is simply for the sake of 
continuity—perhaps barely half a page.) 
§ 1. How the transition from the general form of value to the 
money-form differs from the previous transitions in the development. 
§ 2. Transformation of the relative form of value into the price form. 
§ 3. The simple form of commodity is the secret of the money-form.

IN HANOVER 
London, 13 July 1867 
Dear Friend, 
THANKS FOR HEGEL AND the young madam!a 
I shall now briefly answer all the points you raised. 
Engels is in Denmark at present and will be paying you a visit 
one day in the course of this month. 449 Ad vocemh the same: you 
recall you told me that Menke (or whatever the man in your 
statistical office in Hanover is called) made some very appreciative 
remarks about the work of mine1  that was published by Duncker. 
For Engels' ears I have twisted this, to the effect that Menke 
expressed his great appreciation to me of Engels' 'Condition of the 
Working Class'.* 1 The reason for this pia fraus'' (and I have 
perpetrated various fraudes 1 with the same object in view): to spur 
Engels on to write and publish the second volume, concerning the 
period from 1845 to the present. I have at last succeeded in this to 
the extent that he has promised to get down to it. So, if by chance 
conversation should turn to the statistician, do not let the cat out of 
the bag. 
Nothing is fixed for my wife's journey, nor can it be, it having 
been overtaken by another event, the proposed departure of my 3 
daughters for Bordeaux, to visit Lafargue senior.g

health of all 3 girls made this invitation a real blessing. But 
propriety required that the secrétaire de l'Espagne should not be

Furthermore, their watches, dresses, etc., had to be reclaimed

Dear Moor, 
Enclosed a five-pound-note which I fortunately obtained yester­
day and which will now satisfy your FRENCHMAN. Also Dronke's 
letter. So, the little man has got himself properly into the mire 
with his petty speculations. I fear that, if he is to shake off his 
obligations in respect of the Barnedi shares, he will have to go 
through the BANKRUPTCY COURT. It is very hard for the little fellow, 
firstly the court-case over the insurance business, and now these 
blows. However, I assume he will still have his agency, and with its 
help and with speculation a little less heated, he may soon restore 
his fortunes. 
I have cursorily read through as far as sheet 32a and will give 
you my comments on it in due course; the numerous examples in 
this section, on cursory first reading, somewhat obscure its 
coherence. But there are some very fine things in it, and both 
capital and its sycophants will be eternally grateful to you. 
On my journey back here449 I had the added pleasure of a 
rifle-bullet shattering the window and flying through the carriage 
not 12 inches from my chest: some VOLUNTEER probably wished to 
demonstrate yet again that he ought not to be entrusted with a 
firearm. It is the strangest RAILWAY ACCIDENT I have ever encoun­

Dear FREDERICK, 
As you will see from the enclosed, I am threatened with 
distraint if I do not pay the taxes (amounting to £ll-9s.) next 
Friday. I have an additional £1-15s. interest to pay to the 
pawnshop at the end of this week, or the things will lapse. I did 
not tell you of all these abominations before, as I had previously 
been attempting—vainly, I'm afraid—to rustle up the money in 
London. 
With the huge sums that you have sent me this year, there 
would be no such PRESSURE, if it had not been for over £200 in 
previous debts. If I am to straighten out my affairs and not to 
PRESSURE you so dreadfully, it is imperative that I raise a loan 
somewhere else, even if another journey to the Continent is 
required for the purpose. But I cannot lift a finger until the 
printing is complete.3 I received the 48th sheet today. So this week 
the whole vile business will be over.

need to pay him until as late as possible in September, otherwise I 
shall be completely stuck, since you will understand that I too have 
a mass of payments to make here, especially in the new half-year. 
Furthermore, consequent upon the fall in the price of yarns, we 
are having to enter the stock in the accounts at approx. £2,500 
less than by the prices which applied at the time of my departure. 
Which is not very pleasant either! 
When do you wish to have some of the sheets" returned? 
Schorlemmer asked me to pass them on to him a few at a time, as 
I finished with them, but that naturally depends on you. I have 
now read the thing through to the end (cursorily) and definitely 
think that the second volume is also indispensable, and the sooner 
you finish it, the better.418  I am now looking through the whole 
thing again, i.e., the more theoretical aspects. The fellows will be 
astonished to see with what consummate ease the most difficult 
points, such as Ricardo's theory of profit, are dealt the coup de 
grâce here 'in this way'. 
Kindest regards to your wife.

Dear Moor, 
I have now worked through as far as sheet 36a approx,, and I 
congratulate you on the comprehensive way in which the most 
complex economic problems are elucidated simply and almost 
sensuously merely by arranging them suitably and by placing them 
in the right context. Likewise, in respect of subject-matter, on the 
quite splendid exposition of the relationship between labour and 
capital—for the first time here in its full context and complete. I 
was also greatly diverted to see how you have worked your way 
into the language of technology, which must surely have given you 
much trouble and on which account I had various MISGIVINGS. I have 
corrected several SLIPS  OF THE PEN in pencil in the margin, and also 
ventured to make a few conjectures. But how could you leave the 
of the first volume of Capital

outward structure of the book in its present form! The 4th chapter 
is almost 200 pages long and only has 4 sub-sections, indicated by 
four headings in ordinary print, which it is hardly possible to 
refer back to. Furthermore, the train of thought is constantly 
interrupted by illustrations, and the point to be illustrated is never 
summarised after the illustration, so that one is for ever plunging 
straight from the illustration of one point into the exposition of 
another point. It is dreadfully tiring, and confusing, too, if one is 
not all attention. It would have been highly desirable here to have 
subdivided the text more frequently and to have made the most 
important sections stand out more,454 and this must emphatically 
be done for the English version. In this exposition (especially of 
cooperation and manufacture) there are indeed several points that 
are not yet quite clear to me, where I cannot work out which facts 
lie behind the argument that is expressed solely in general terms. 
To judge by the outward form of the exposition, this 4th chapter 
also appears to be the most hurriedly written and the least 
carefully revised. However, all that is of no import, the main thing 
is that our economists are not given a weak point anywhere 
through which they can shoot holes; I am indeed curious to hear 
what these gentlemen will say, they have not been left even the 
smallest opening. Roscher and his ilk will not be unduly 
perturbed, but for the people here in England who do not write 
for 3-year-olds, it is a different matter altogether. 
I very much look forward to your sending me some more sheets 
as soon as you can, I particularly want to read the section on 
accumulation in its context.455 
Give your wife my best wishes. When are the girls coming 
back? a

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 24 August 1867 
DEAR FRED, 
I have received no further corrected proofsa  since the 2 last that 
I sent you. I am exceedingly vexed with Meissner. He has 
obviously held back what Wigand has sent him in order to send 
everything at once—and save 4d. postage! 
The same Meissner wrote me last week that he is printing a 
certain part of my preface specially (and he has indeed made the 
right choice) to send to the German newspapers. I wrote asking 
him to send me COPIES of it at once. I reckoned that you would 
translate the thing into English (I shall then give it to The 
Bee-Hive, which is taken by Mill, Beesly, Harrison, etc.), and 
Lafargue with Laura's help into French for the Courrier français, 
finally I wanted to send ONE COPY to my correspondent in 
America. 456 To save the 4d., Meissner has sent nothing. He will be 
sending it all together. But a great deal of time is lost in the 
process! 
The best points in my book are: 1. (this is fundamental to all 
understanding of the  FACTS)  the two-fold character of labour 
according to whether it is expressed in use-value or exchange-
value, which is brought out in the very First Chapter; 2. the 
treatment of surplus-value regardless of its particular forms as profit, 
interest, ground rent, etc. This will be made clear in the second 
volume especially.418 The treatment of the particular forms in 
classical political economy, where they are for ever being jumbled up 
together with the general form, is an olla potrida!1 
Please enter your  desiderata, 11 critical remarks, QUERIES, etc., on the 
corrected proofs. This is very important for me, as I am reckoning 
on a 2nd edition sooner or later.454 As regards CHAPTER IV, it was a 
hard job finding things themselves, i.e., their interconnection? But 
with that once behind me, along came one BLUE BOOK359 after 
another just as I was composing the final version, and I was 
delighted to find my theoretical conclusions fully confirmed by the 
a of the first volume of Capital - b hotchpotch - c recommendations - d See previ­
ous letter.

FACTS.  Finally, it was written to the accompaniment of  CARBUNCLES 
and daily dunning  by  creditors! 
For the  conclusion  to the 2nd  book (Process  of Circulation), which 
I am  writing now,457  I am  again obliged  to seek your advice  on one 
point,  as I did  many years  ago. 
Fixed capital only  has to be  replaced  in natura 3 after,  say, 10 
years.  In the  meantime,  its value returns partially  and  gradatim, b as 
the goods that  it has  produced  are  sold. This  PROGRESSIVE RETURN  of 
the fixed capital  is only required  for its  replacement (aside from 
REPAIRS  and the  like) when  it becomes defunct  in its  material form, 
e.g., as a  machine. Prior  to that, however, these  SUCCESSIVE RETURNS  are 
in the  capitalist's possession. 
Many years  ago I  wrote  to you  that  it seemed  to me  that  in this 
manner  an  accumulation fund  was  being built  up,  since  in the 
intervening period  the  capitalist  was of  course using  the  returned 
money, before replacing  the  capital fixe with  it. You  disagreed with 
this  SOMEWHAT SUPERFICIALLV  in a  letter.458  I later found that MacCul-
loch describes this  SINKING FUND  as an  accumulation  fund! 1 Being 
convinced that  no  idea  of MacCulloch's could ever  be right,  I let 
the matter drop.  His  apologetic purpose here  has  already been 
refuted  by the  Malthusians,  but  they,  too,  admit  the  FACT. 
Now,  as a  manufacturer,  you  must know what  you do  with  the 
RETURNS  on capital fixe before  the  time  it has to be  replaced  in natura. 
And you  must answer this point  for me  (without theorising,  in 
purely practical terms).

ENGELS TO MARX 419 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 26 August 1867 
Dear Moor, 
On the question of the replacement-fund, full details with 
accompanying calculations tomorrow. You see, I must ask some 
other manufacturers whether our practice is the customary one or 
an exception. The question is whether, with an original outlay of 
£1,000 on machinery, where £100 is written off in the 1st year, 
the rule is to write off 10% of the £1,000 in the 2nd year, or of 
£900, etc. We do the latter, and understandably the matter goes 
on thereby in infinitum," at least in theory. This complicates the 
arithmetic considerably. But, otherwise, there is no doubt that the 
manufacturer is using the replacement-fund on average for 41/2 
years before the machinery is worn out, or at least has it at his 
disposal. However, this is included in the calculations, by way of 
what one might call a certain guarantee against moral wear and 
tear, or alternatively the manufacturer says: the assumption that in 
10 years the machinery will be completely worn out is only 
approximately correct, i.e., it presupposes that I receive the money 
for the replacement-fund in 10 annual instalments from the 
outset. At all events, you shall have the calculations; regarding the 
economic significance of the matter, I am none too clear about it, I 
do not see how the manufacturer is supposed to be able to cheat 
the other partners in the surplus-value, that is, the ultimate 
consumers, by thus falsely representing the position—in the long 
run. Nota bene, as a rule, machinery is depreciated at 7 '/2%> which 
assumes a useful life of approximately 13 years. 
Moore sends you his photograph, enclosed, and reminds you 
that you promised him yours, which he is very eager to have. 
The chapter on accumulation is quite splendid.455

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 27 August 1867 
Dear Moor, 
Enclosed two schedules for machinery, which will make the 
matter fully clear to you. The rule is that part of the original sum 
is written off each year, usually 7 72%. but to simplify the 
calculation I have kept to 10%, which is not excessive for many 
machines either. Thus, e.g., 
1860 1 Jan. Purchases £ 1,000 
1861 1 Jan. Written off 10% " 100 
£ 900 
New purchase " 200 
£ i.ioo 
1862 1 Jan. Written off 10% £1,200 (£1,000+£200) " 120 
£ 980 
New purchase " 200 
£ 1,180 
1863 1 Jan. Written off 10% £l,OO0+£20O+£200 " 140 
PtC . ... . 
£ 1,040» 
In schedule No. 1 I am now assuming that the manufacturer 
puts his [money] out at interest for writing-off purposes; on the 
day when he has to replace the old machinery with new, he has 
not £1,000 but £1,252-1 Is. Schedule No. 2 assumes that he puts 
the money straight into new machinery, each year. As is shown in 
the last column giving the value of the total purchases as it stands 
on the last day of the 10 years, it is true that the value of his 
machinery then does not exceed £1,000 (and he cannot have 
more, as he has, after all, only invested the value of what has been 
worn out, and the total value of the machinery cannot thus grow 
by the process), but he has extended his factory from year to year, 
and as an average over the 11 years he has employed machinery 
which cost £1,449 in investment, in other words, he has produced 
and earned substantially more than with the original £1,000. Let 
us assume he is a spinner and every £ represents one spindle 
together with the roving-frame; in that case, he has on average 
a The original has: £1,020. 

=====第449页=====
245. Engels to Marx. 27 August 1867 411 
spun with 1,449 spindles instead of  1,000,  and, after the original 
spindles have ended their useful lives, he begins the new period 
on 1 January 1866 with 1,357 spindles that he has purchased in 
the meantime,to which is added a further 236 from the writing off 
as per 1865, which makes 1,593 spindles. The money advanced 
for writing off has thus enabled him to increase his machinery by 
60%  and without putting a KARTHING of his actual profit into the new 
investment. 
Repairs have been disregarded in both schedules. At 10% 
write-off,  the machine should cover its own repair costs, i.e., the 
latter should be included. Nor do they affect the issue, as they are 
either included in the 10%, or else they prolong the useful life of 
the machine in proportion, which amounts to the same thing. 
I hope schedule No. 2 will be sufficiently clear to you; if not, 
just write, I have a copy of it here. 
In haste.

you can in German-American papers and, where feasible, in 
English-American papers as well. Be so kind as to send me a copy,

Ad vocem Weber.c His fatherd  is a fool, exilé from Baden, 
clockmaker. The boy with whose presence you are blessed there is 
a scoundrel. The Hatzfeldt woman picked him for the assassina­
tion of Lassalle's KILLER. 6 He took the money and followed his 
intended victim as far as Augsburg or thereabouts. Then he 
funked it. He then absconded with the Hatzfeldt money from 
Germany to America (trying to squeeze yet more from the old 
woman by threats). 
His worthy father and his brother/ living here, said in the 
(German) Communist SocietyR here that I denounced the good lad 
to the German police. That was how they explained his exit and 
cheating of Countess Hatzfeldt. I went along to the Society,

ever.

wish they had stayed away longer. They were enjoying themselves 
over there. But Lafargue has to get back to his school. (It always

Dear Moor, 
I have just received payment for a very long-standing bad debt 
of £5 which will put me in a position to send you that sum 
tomorrow as soon as I have cashed the CHEQUE. Otherwise, I should 
have been in something of a fix, what with the repayment of the 
£45 to Borkheim now due. What about Borkheim, is he back? I 
am now able and therefore wish to settle up. 
The 8 sheets3  received with thanks. The theoretical side is quite 
splendid, as is the exposition of the history of expropriation. But 
the piece you have inserted on Ireland was done in the most 
fearful haste, and the material is not properly knocked into shape 
at all. On first reading often positively incomprehensible. Further 
comments as soon as I have considered the stuff more closely. The 
résumé on the expropriation of the expropriators is most brilliant 
and will create quite an effect. 4<i3 
It is fortunate that almost all of the book is 'enacted' in England, 
so to speak; otherwise para. 100 of the Prussian Penal Code would 
be operable: 'Whosoever ... shall incite the subjects of the State to 
hatred or contempt of each other',b etc.—and confiscation would 
ensue. Bismarck seems to be needing to stage a little demonstra­
tion against the workers anyway. In Erfurt or thereabouts a 
Lassallean poet, printer and publisher464  have been arraigned for 
high treason, and in Elberfeld they have even confiscated a scrawl 
by the noble Schweitzer. 0 So, it is possible that the book would be 
prohibited in Prussia, but, anyway, that would not have any effect 
in present conditions.

Dear Moor, 
The £5 banknote enclosed. You will have received the booklet 
'TRANSACTIONS' [OF THE] R[OYAL] SOCIETY. 4M Can you send me the July 
and August Free  Presses,  as promised? 
Things appear to have taken a very sharp turn in Paris; every 
day all the papers are following Girardin's example in recalling 
1829 and 1847,466 and the Lille speech, full of resignation, appears 
to prove that there is nothing to be done in South Germany and 
Austria precisely now when hea needs it, obviously solely in 
consequence of the sorry state of the latter. 'And hence' it is only 
'weak governments' which incline to use foreign conflicts as a 
means of avoiding internal difficulties.407  Then, the constantly 
reiterated allusions to 'mon fils' h do not appear to imply any very 
significant confidence in the longevity of the 'père' quem nuptiae 
demonstrant c either. You must press ahead with the second 
volume,418 things may soon start to happen. 
On Saturday I saw a Californian newspaper, which suggested 
the 8 HOURS-MOVEMENT must have had an enormous impact amongst 
the BUILDING TRADES there. The MASTERS are forming a 10-HOURS-
ASSOCIATION  to oppose it and are setting up a considerable wailing. 
Contracts for l'/2 million dollars are said to have been withdrawn 
as a result of the 8  HOURS  business.468 
Gumpert is back and says that in Electoral Hesse the rage at the 
Prussians is as furious as in Hanover, though less demonstrative. 
The moment the military were to leave, every 'Prussian' would be 
slaughtered. Amongst other things the Prussians have confiscated 
the officers' widows and pension fund in Kassel which derived 
from compulsory contributions from the officers. He found things even 
hotter in Hanover than I did. 
Kugelmann also wanted to attend the Lausanne Congress, 462 i.e., 
as a SPECTATOR, perhaps it would be a good thing to inform Eccarius 
of this. He will probably encounter Schorlemmer, who left 
yesterday (via Grimsby), at the Naturalists' Congress in Frankfurt.

DEAR FRED, 
The £5 received with thanks. 
Borkheim wrote to me a few days ago from Berne and sent me 
'for comment if you would be so kind' the brouillon'' for the 
speech, which he is intending to give at the PEACE CONGRESS in 
Geneva. 469 He also wanted your assistance. I wrote to him, as we 
had agreed, that you had not yet returned. You can, however, 
send the money to his associate Schyler, 65 Fenchurch Street. But it 
is £50, not 45. When I looked, I found that the bill was on £48, 
and Borkheim then told me that he could probably give me the 
full sum of £50. I did not tell you of this before, as I was 
expecting the money I had been promised any day, and then 
wanted to pay the £50  myself. 
Enclosed: 
1. the last sheets of the proofs.b 
2. 2 Diplomatic Reviews and 1 number of Courrier français. 
Regarding the final sheets, they have put the Addendum to the 
Notes in large print, and the Appendix on the Form of Value in small 
print, despite my instructions.470 They probably did this so that the 
book should be neither over nor under 50 sheets in length. In my

opinion, Meissner has made a serious blunder in increasing the 
purchase-price from 3 talers to 3 talers 10 silver groschen. It is, 
however, possible as well that he has subsequently received so 
many more firm orders that this was commercially the correct 
thing to do. 
A word of explanation concerning the article in the Courrier 
français (which you must send back to me after you have read it 
through): 'Les Conditions de la Paix' 3: 
You know that on the GENERAL COUNCIL I expressed my 
opposition to our joining the peace-at-any-price party.b My speech 
lasted  ABOUT  1/2 HOUR.  AS minute-secretary, Eccarius reported on it 
in The Bee-Hive, giving only a few sentences of what I said. The 
reprint in the Courrier even omits the sentences about the 
necessity for armies vis-à-vis Russia and about the cowardice of 
these fellows. 471 The affair has, nevertheless, created quite a stir. 
The jackasses from the  PEACE  CONGRESS, whose agent in London is 
M. de Colleville, completely changed their original programme and 
even smuggled into the new one, which is much more democratic, 
the words 'THE HARMONIZING OK ECONOMIC INTERESTS WITH LIBERTY', which 
could mean almost anything, including just FREETRADE. They have 
been bombarding me with letters and even had the impertinence 
to send me the enclosed scrap of paper with the new programme. 
Their impertinence consists in nominating me as a 'MEMBER  OF THE 
GENEVA,  ETC., CONGRESS'in the address. The Courrier, which was their 
most vociferous advocate in Paris, is deserting them, as you will 
see. The same Courrier has changed its policy in respect of Russia, 
following a private letter that I wrote to Vermorel ABOUT a 
fortnight ago c (we are not acquainted). 
The main point was that these fine gentlemen from the peace 
congress, Victor Hugo, Garibaldi, L. Blanc, etc., had kept them­
selves supremely aloof from our INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION. I have 
now obliged them to acknowledge us as a real force. 
From Naples I have received the first 2 numbers of a paper 
Libertà e Giustizia. In No. I they declare themselves to be our 
organ. I have passed it to Eccarius to place before the congress. 462 
No. II, which I shall send you, contains a very good attack on 
Mazzini.d I suspect that Bakunin has a hand in it. 
With regard to the confiscation and prohibition of my book,e 
there is a world of difference between prohibiting electoral

pamphlets and a book of 50 sheets which has such an air of 
erudition and even contains notes in Greek. Admittedly, that 
might be of little avail if I had chosen 12 administrative districts in 
Prussia instead of 12 COUNTIES in England to describe the conditions 
of the agricultural workers. I also feel that Mr Bismarck will think 
twice about the matter before provoking me into attacking his 
regime in London and Paris. 
What conditions are like in Prussia, incidentally, is shown by the 
following statement by O. Hübner, Director of the Central Statistical 
Archive, in a message to his electors: 
'The people are already overburdened. Apart from the armament factories, 
almost every trade is depressed, hundreds of hungry men are applying for the 
humblest positions, in the cities the number of empty dwellings and of citizens, who 
cannot afford to pay rent, is growing, a whole host of estates and houses are being 
subjected to compulsory auction, the poor-houses are being besieged by our maimed 
victors and by the unemployed, everywhere there is a lack of confidence in the 
present and the future, and the budgets of the poorest are beset by the realisation 
that they are already paying more for the services of the state than they are  worth," 
In Berlin, neither the government nor the National-Liberal 
Party432 has got a single candidate through.2  But just what utter 
blockheads those men of Progress" are who now form the 
extreme left, is shown amongst other things by the following 
extract from their 'most radical' organ, the Zukunft: 
'The whole English nation is permeated by a  snobbery  which treats all alike and to 
which all personal industry is anathema. [...] It is this same  snobbery  which is for ever 
urging reduction of working hours and prohibits overtime on account of the  UNIONS!'b 
Would you credit it! Even now the Parisian press is truly a giant 
compared with the German press!

DEAR FRED, 
Regarding the 'transatlantic Ocean', it is a matter for the final 
corrector to put right such lapsus pennae? I see that the Zukunft 
has reprinted this splendid 'flow' along with the greater part of 
the preface. b 
The translation in The Bee-Hivec  is by Eccarius. I believe that 
most of the errors stem not from him, but, because of his bad 
hand-writing, from The Bee-Hive's CORRECTORS. I would naturally 
have preferred you to do the translation. However, as Eccarius 
offered his services de prime abord, ,d and is now on the staff of The 
Bee-Hive, that was not feasible. 
I shall personally deliver the coup de grâce to those Proudhonist 
jackasses at the next congress in Brussels. I have DIPLOMATICALLY

before my book appears and our Association is firmly rooted. By 
the by, I shall give them a caning in the OFFICIAL REPORT of the 
GENERAL COUNCIL (despite all their efforts, the Parisian wind-bags 
were unable to prevent our re-election475). 
MEANWHILE our Association has made great progress. The 
wretched Star, which wanted to ignore us entirely, announced in 
its leading article yesterday that we are more important than the 
PEACE CONGRESS.461 Schulze-Delitzsch could not prevent his '  Workers' 
Association' in Berlin from joining  us. 476 Those wretches from 
among the English TRADE UNIONISTS, who think we are too 
'extreme', are coming flocking. Besides the Courrier français, 
there have been reports on our congress in Girardin's Liberté, 
Siècle, Mode, Gazette de France, etc. Les choses  marchent 3 And when 
the next revolution comes, and that will perhaps be sooner than 
might appear, we (i.e., you and I) will have this mighty ENGINE at 
our disposal. COMPARE WITH THIS THE RESULTS OF MAZZINFS, ETC, OPERATIONS 
SINCE 30 YEARS! And with no money to boot! And with the intrigues 
of the Proudhonists in Paris, Mazzini in Italy and the jealous 
Odger, Cremer, Potter in London, with the Schulze-Delitzsch and 
the Lassalleans in Germany! We can be well satisfied! 
My children arrived back safe and in good spirits with Lafargue 
yesterday.b He has brought an enormous crystal goblet (holds IV2 
POTS)  back with him for you. He appears to be impressed with your 
'transatlantic Ocean'. 
In these days, Lafargue would like to visit you for 3 days at this 
time before his lectures begin again. The most awkward thing 
about it is that he is demanding (of course, not being IN THE  SECRET 
OF MY MONEY-AFFAIRS)  that I should accompany him, and I have not yet 
found a satisfactory excuse for turning down this tour, which I 
just cannot manage.

ENGELS TO MARX 419 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 11 September 1867 
Dear Moor, 
The congress really does appear to have been swept away in the 
French tide this time, the number of Proudhonist resolutions is 
really far too large.462  It is good that it will be coming to Belgium 
next time, by then it will perhaps be possible to do something in 
North Germany as well, and then, with the help of the English, to 
dam up the flood. Meanwhile, whatever they resolve there is more 
or less just wasted breath as long as the CENTRAL COUNCIL remains in 
London. Once again notre cher c Philipp Becker appears to have 
committed some of his unpremeditated blunders, for which one 
must forgive the old agitator when he has no one to guide him. 478 
That Eccarius wrote the reports in The Times must be kept 
secret.473  In view of the manner in which the editors have trimmed 
his story, it could do him enormous harm. The next time that he 
reports to the paper, he will have to consider more carefully to 
what extent his humour can be exploited by the bourgeois editors 
to cast RIDICULE on the whole business and not just on the few 
crapauds? 
Since you are in contact with Vermorel, can you not moderate 
the fellow's asininities with regard to Germany? It is really too 
much if the jackass is demanding that Bonaparte should become 
a Käthe Freiligrath - b Die Zukunft, No. 208 (supplement), 6 September 1867. -

liberal, bourgeois liberal, and then start a war to liberate Germany 
from the tyranny of Bismarck!" These crapauds, who will have to 
handle Germany with great delicacy even if they do make a 
revolution, believe that but a slight turn toward liberalism would 
enable them to revert to their old roles. I regard it as most 
important, particularly in the event of a revolution, that these 
gentlemen should become accustomed to treating us d'égal à égal b 
According to them, Bismarckism in Germany is an inherent 
characteristic of Germany, which they must destroy by intervening, 
but their own Bonapartism is a mere accident and could be 
terminated just by a change of ministers and transformed into its 
opposite. 
The great Schweitzer has been happily elected with the 
assistance of the pietists55 of Elberfeld and Barmen, and will now 
have the opportunity to bowdlerise various points from your 
bookc in the 'Reichstag'. You may wager your life that he will do 
so. However, it can only do good and will afford us much 
entertainment; once the book is out, only good can come of such 
things. 
Apropos of Barmen, I am reminded of Siebel. The poor devil is 
dreadfully sick again and is once more having to leave Barmen, 
though I do not know whereto; it is possible he will not live out 
the winter. He must be very bad, so I cannot count on him raising 
any cry for your book in the newspapers. He has written me a 
very DESPONDING letter. 
The TRADES OUTRAGE COMMISSION'S442 conclusions here are entirely 
farcical and are no different from those reached 7 years ago. If 
they do not produce anything better, they might as well pack their 
bags.  Just imagine seeing BRICKMAKING AND BRICKLAYING treated as the 
chief industries of Manchester! 
The defects which have become apparent in the tests carried out 
on the Chassepot rifle here are the very ones which had already 
been discovered in Berlin and which Bölzig told me of in 
Hanover. At that time, I thought that they had deliberately allowed 
faulty specimens to fall into the hands of the Prussians, but now it 
rather looks as though there is something in it, in which case the 
rifle is not half as good as the Prussians' needle-gun. 
Meissner's people in Leipzig appear to be taking an inordinately 
long time to send the book out. Still no notices anywhere. Do you 
think I should attack the thing from the bourgeois point of view,

it myself,  but one can never swear that the zeal of some

Dear FRED, 
Meissner's procrastination bodes most ill. He could have 
disposed of many COPIES' at the congress in Lausanne.462 And the 
book would have been discussed there as a real event. Such 
stupidity is beyond my comprehension. Next Saturday it will be 4 
weeks since I sent the last corrections to Leipzig.0 
Your plan to attack the book from the  bourgeois  point of view is the 
best tactic. However—once the thing is out—I consider it better to 
have this done through Siebel or Rittershaus, rather than 
Meissner. There is no need to let even the best publishers see 
through one's game. On the other hand, you must write a few 
instructions to Kugelmann, who is back, concerning the positive 
aspects he should emphasise. Otherwise, he will do something 
foolish, enthusiasm alone being insufficient in this case. Naturally, 
you will feel less inhibited about doing this than I.

I am  entirely  of your mind  quoad"  Eccarius.b  A worker  is lacking 
in diplomatic finesse, especially  one  with  the  critical bluntness  of 
Eccarius.  He  writes  to The  Times  as  though  he  were writing  for 
the Neue Rheinische Zeitungs-Revue. c However,  no  harm  has  been 
done. Here  in  London they  are  saying that  the  INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION,  etc., must  be strong indeed  for The  Times  to  report  so 
expressly on it. Eccarius'  SNEERS  are taken to be Times  SNEERS. 473 
It was the  wretched French Swiss,  who,  being very strongly 
represented, gave  the  French wind-bags from Paris  so much scope. 
Old Becker  was  responsible  for the  most serious  BLUNDER.478  He  first 
disrupted  the  agenda  we had  planned,  so as to  spring  his  freedom 
resolution. This then provided  the  Parisians with  the  opportunity  to 
let themselves  go. 
But none  of that signifies.  The  main thing  is that  the  congress 
was held,  not  what happened there.  On se moquera bien d of the 
Paris  WISEACRES  in our  GENERAL REPORT.  TO the latter's great dismay, a 
resolution  was  adopted that those  who do not pay (and the 
Parisians have  not  paid  a farthing) cannot send delegates  in 
future.  The aim  must  be to  send  20  English  and 30  Germans  to 
Brussels next time. 475 As  TO THE BELGIANS THEMSELVES,  they  can  only 
send  1 MAN  per 500, so  there will  not be  very many  of them. They 
are furthermore  RATHER REBELLIOUS  towards the Parisians. 
Nota bene:  the  worst thing  is, we  have  not a  single  man in  Paris 
who could make contact with  the  workers' sections which  are 
hostile  to the  Proudhonists  (and  they form  the  majority!).  If 
Dupont were  to spend  a few  weeks  in Paris, everything would  be 
in order,  but the  police have  him  under close surveyance. 
In due  course  I shall write privately  to Vermorel  and  knock 
those absurd notions about German politics  out of  him.e  I shall 
have  to proceed gradatim*  and  therefore deliberately began with  the 
UNITED STATES, RUSSIA  and  TURKEY,  because this is 'neutral' ground 
between Germans  and  French.8

[London,] 12 September 1867 
DEAR FRED, 
I am sending this 2nd letter, because Eccarius' LETTER has just 
arrived.480 
Apropos. What Eccarius could not have known: L. Blanc has 
absented himself from the Geneva Congress,3  because 'my' people 
would be playing tricks there; Jules Favre, because the 'class 
question' b (as a SUPPORTER of Cavaignac in the June days,481  his 
CONSCIENCE is, of course, not CLEAN) has been adopted by the Courrier 
français, along London lines.

Dear Moor, 
You have not enclosed letter No. 2 from Lessner.477 If Lafargue 
does come, I would much appreciate it if you came too,c as I do 
not rightly know how to entertain our comrade during my 
business hours. If possible, you should come straight away 
tomorrow, or at least on the morning of the day after, so that we 
can be together on Saturday and Sunday, and I can also more

easily take some French leave on Monday. But write or telegraph 
beforehand, so that I can arrange lodging (telegraph the office, 
except Saturday after 11.0.a.m. and Sunday). 
£5 enclosed to help with money-matters; apart from the cost of 
travelling here, you can leave it at home for your wife. 
Here, too, the press is treating the International much more 
decently than before. All the newspapers here have carried some 
part of the proceedings,3 the Examiner & Timesb had a philistinish-
ly benevolent LEADER. 
Would it not be appropriate also to report on the meetings of 
the CENTRAL COUNCIL in the German newspapers? e.g., the Zukunft; 
Wilhelmchen c might perhaps find somewhere else, too. Where 
actually is the noble fellow now? 
The Lassalleans are beset by a fresh shindig again. Dr Reincke 
in Hagen and Schweitzer are  AT  DAGGERS  DRAWN.  Reincke went along 
with the party-of-Progress clique"— Bürgers and E. Richter — to 
ensure his election in Hagen, Düsseldorf and Solingen, but failed in 
the two latter. 
We really must try to establish a direct link with the workers in 
Germany again, that is what we most lack, otherwise everything is 
buoyant enough. 
I read of the betrothal of Käthe, d as she calls  herself,  in the 
Kölnische Zeitung. 
You will have to give me a verbal account of the congress 
telegrams from Germany. 
The Courriers^ returned herewith. Apropos of the vote in 
Schleswig, it is splendid how those jackasses declared: avons une 
carte devant nous, ( which shows Holstein within Schleswig (or 
vice versa)! Likewise, they first have the Federal  troops  and then the 
Dutch (instead of the Luxemburgers themselves) marching into 
Luxemburg. And it is they who want to abolish IGNORANCE!

MARX TO ENGELS 33 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 4 October 1867a 
DEAR FRED, 
Since my return from Manchester482  almost until now, I have 
had a feverish cold. I caught the  COLD  in the course of the railway 
malheur}' 
As there are many things about which I wish to write to you,  ON 
PUBLIC  AND PRIVATE  AFFAIRS,  in this letter, I shall start with the  book,''  so 
that I do not forget it. You would have spent long indeed 
searching in Table C for the decrease in the cultivation of green 
crops (p. 695). Mr Wigand has printed C instead of B (p. 690), 
which tells us, under the heading 'Green Crops', that from 1861-65 
107,984 acres were put out of cultivation.485 Indeed you will 
observe from the schedule of misprints on p. 784 that Mr Wigand 
has wilfully abbreviated it from p. 292 onwards in order to 
accommodate it on the last page. The section concerning Ireland 
was certainly written very hastily, but for a second edition it could 
be put in order with but a few formal alterations. The most 
important thing is the FACTS, which are not known even in 
England.463 
I have heard nothing from Meissner. Schabelitz (Basle) told 
Borkheim he has requested 5 copies for sale or return on the 
a The original has '1859' corrected by Engels: '!! 1867', with the note Voila bien, le 
pire Marx! (There you are, Father Marx!). - b misfortunes - c the first volume of

261. Marx to Engels. 4 October 1867 433 
strength of 5 copies which he ordered for cash payment, but 
Meissner replied he did not have enough to send him so many for 
sale or return. However, this may merely be a diplomatic 
manoeuvre on Meissner's part. I see from the enclosed note from 
Liebknecht (who  BY  THE  BY has done us proud with his first 
intervention in the Reichstag, vide* the Zukunft No. 229 of 1 
October 486) that Meissner is not always so punctilious. It was 
agreed that he should send 1 copy to Liebknecht and 1 copy to Dr 
Weiss for the editors (Zukunft). 
Professor Beesly has now returned home, and I shall be hearing 
from him before very long. Quant àb Siebel, I should also like to 
know whether he has received the copies, 1 for himself and 1 for 
Rittershaus? and how the latter has requited it? 
Ad vocemc  Vogt: you will find some news about Vogt in the 
enclosed letter from Kugelmann. 487 After Kugelmann had depart­
edd and the gang thought Borkheim had likewise gone, a final 
meeting of the Germans took place, at which Borkheim suddenly 
appeared and witnessed the following occurrence. Mr Goegg 
handed a slip of paper to the Vice-President, Büchner, in which 
he declared that the Bonapartist rumours, etc., regarding Vogt 
were false, and offered a testimonium virtutis' for the man, whom 
he claimed to have known for 20 years. He demanded that 
Büchner sign this note, i.e., certify that it had been communicated 
to him. Büchner naturally did so. Whereupon LITTLE Beust jumps 
up, states in writing that Goegg is only expressing a private 
opinion which is by no means shared in Switzerland, etc., etc. Ditto 
demands certification of his protest by Büchner, which the latter 
supplies. Vogt's manoeuvre was thus frustrated. To what depths 
that fellow has descended! 
Another INCIDENT at the Peace Congress! Ludwig Simon ap­
proaches Goegg: 'Why have you not moved my name nearer to 
the top of the list of speakers! Why is Borkheim given the floor 
before me?' Goegg: 'Those fellows—the proletarians—had 4 of the 
German vice-presidents. To bring in our man Grün and get 
Borkheim to give up his place, we had to make this concession to 
him, etc.!' Hardly were the words out of that beau's' mouth than 
he looks round and to his horror sees Eccarius grinning behind 
his back.

understand  Stumpf.  Perhaps you will be more fortunate and be

of Peace and Freedom - c certificate of virtue - f The German word used by Marx

able to 'delineate the scientific process of pauperisation' and ditto 
'the correct conclusion' from the 'evidence' which he keeps in his 
pocket and does not divulge. His letter enclosed.488 
Ad vocem Dronke: Borkheim spoke to a man in Paris who has a 
precise acquaintance with all Dronke's affairs and described him as 
a 'voleur' 3 The copper company had served notice on Dronke a 
year ago. It now has a firm in Glasgow as its associate and 
therefore has no more need of an English agency. Dronke, 
dicitur, b has been guilty of much 'embezzlement' in the past year 
and has made himself the object of an 'embarrassing' investigation. 
I hope the affair will be hushed up. 
Ad vocem Collet: what follows is by way of explanation for the 
enclosed curiosa: Collet's little girl (whom you have met) and her 
even younger brother were visiting us a few days ago. The boy 
had a boxing match with Lafargue, who eventually pinned him to 
the floor in a humiliating position. Then says the boy, 'REMEMBER 
HOW  YOU GOT ON AT WATERLOO!' Hence this comical correspondence, 
with the girl denouncing the lad to the old man. 
Collet has withdrawn from The Diplomatic Review, although his 
name still figures on the paper this time. I immediately noticed 
the change of editor, as I was only sent 1 COPY You shall have it as 
soon as I am finished with it. It is a thoroughly foolish number. 
Garibaldi is described as 'a common bandit, atheist,  FOOL,  etc.', 
M. Dupanloup, the évêque c of Orleans, by contrast, as the great 
man of the age. d Will David' yet become a Catholic one day 
perhaps? The Peace Congress in Geneva was, of course, a 
fabrication of the Russians, which is why they sent along their 'WELL 
WORN OUT AGENT Bakounine'. I have the impression that The 
Diplomatic Review is on its last legs. 
Ad vocem INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION. At my suggestion, the office 
of president has been abolished, after Odger had already been 
proposed for re-election.489—Fox, who has missed no opportunity 
to exhibit his profound hatred for Eccarius since the latter's 
return,' gave notice for the next meeting (Tuesday) that he would 
ask the COUNCIL to consider censuring Eccarius for his 'Times' 
articles.473 To Fox's great surprise I thereupon gave ditto notice 
that I would interpellate Fox next Tuesday about a 'SECRET  LETTER' 
that he had written to Beckerg requesting him 'TO  DO ALL  IN HIS POWER 
TO REMOVE THE SEAT OF THE CENTRAL COUNCIL  FROM  LONDON'.490 Fox, who is

altogether composed of CAPRICES and CROTCHETS, imagines that he 
must found an 'opposition party' on the COUNCIL against the 'German 
dictatorship', as he calls it. He will be astonished at his success in 
this LINE! 
Ad vocem Borkheim:  d'abord, 3 the following  FACTS.  Borkheim 
spoke (or rather read from his manuscript) for over 20 minutes, 
whereas only 10 were permitted by the rules. 469 Naturally, like 
Garibaldi and Edgar Quinet, he too felt he could afford to take 
liberties. Secondly, he mounted the rostrum in a state of extreme 
excitement, and, as Eccarius says, 'did not let himself get a word in 
edgeways'. Nobody understood him. All that people heard were 
the few catchwords about Schulze-Delitzsch, at which Vogt jumped 
up and clenched both his fists, and about the Cossacks. b That was 
fortunate indeed. His speech was thought to be significant because 
it was not understood. He therefore plays some part, both in The 
Times491 and in the French  press.  But now comes the DRAWBACK. The 
fool wishes to have his speech printed in German, English, Russian 
and in the French original. I now have the latter in front of me.c 
He sent it to me so that Lafargue could look through it. With the 
exception of the few catchwords, which I whispered into his ear, it 
is not merely a tasteless hotchpotch, but often pure balderdash. 
And his French! E.g., 
'Sans stultification il serait impossible de discuter, s'il faudrait d'abord faire 
enlever la femelle Isabelle, faire sauter le mâle Bismarck ou faire s'évanouir l'agile 
hermaphrodite Beust. Il y a de grands orateurs, de profonds penseurs français, 
membres de cette union, mais fûssent-ils tous des Mirabeaux achevés et des 
Descartes consommés, les têtes allemandes seraient trop carrées pour le trouver 
rond, qu'il fût d'abord et avant tout le gouvernement français, l'abolition duquel 
introniserait l'ère de la paix internationale.' d 
Assez!e 
How little he suspected the quality of 'his French' is clear from 
the note he jotted in the margin of the manuscript he sent me: 
'Please ask Mr Lafargue to look quickly through it and correct any (!) bad 
French in the margin!' 
a firstly - b  Le Courrier français, No. 88, 13 September 1867. - c S. Borkheim, Ma 
perle devant le  congrès  de Genève. - d 'It would be impossible, without descending to the 
level of idiocy, to discuss whether the first task should be to arrange for the female 
Isabella to be abducted, for the male Bismarck to be overthrown, or for the nimble 
hermaphrodite Beust to evaporate. Among the French members of this Association 
there are some great orators and some profound thinkers, but were they all 
accomplished Mirabeaux and consummate Descartes, the Germans would be too 
squareheaded to accept roundly that it would be first and foremost the French 
government whose destruction would inaugurate the era of international peace.' -
e Enough!

I was,  OF COURSE, OBLIGED to tell him that Lafargue would have to 
see him, as he could not proceed to make the 'deletions' (to begin 
with, Lafargue wants to delete the whole of  THE FIRST HALF)  and 
'amendments' in his absence. He is therefore coming to see me this 
evening. Lafargue additionally showed me French commis voyageur* 
SLANG  in almost every sentence. E.g., 'parlons rondement!'* 
PRIVATE  AFFAIRS:  I have talked to Borkheim about the possibility of 
finding me a LOAN of at least £100 in London. He says yes, he is 
willing to be 1 guarantor if you will be the other. But he would, 
after all, need to hear from yourself about the matter first. The 
situation is simply that I can neither complete Volume  II,418  nor 
find the time for the intrigues required for the English edition,229 
nor even remain in England, if I do not manage to pacify the 
Manichaeans431 for SOME WEEKS AT LEAST. If the English transaction 
succeeds, and if they proceed in such a manner in Germany— 
which does not seem difficult to me—that a 2nd impression454 
soon becomes necessary, the crisis will have been overcome. 
This damned year has been made even worse by Lafargue 
staying with me until now, Laura is to marry in the spring, etc.

Poor Lafargue is in the final throes today, putting Borkheim's

more than 1 hour to speak his indictment. He had most

Apropos. Strohn spent the day here yesterday. He fancies you 
meant to slight him on his last visit to Manchester, with your 
remark, 'Yes, in Bradford the commis voyageur 6 still counts for 
something.' I tried to drive this nonsense out of his mind.— He 
says Dronke had procured the British associé for the copper 
company  himself.  He had probably demanded to be indemnified 
for it, and no doubt he had based himself on spurious but legally 
defensible claims when appropriating or laying his hands on a 
portion of the copper passing through his hands. He did not 
believe that Dronke had unwarrantedly frisé e the code pénal 
directly. Tant mieux 1

and my relations with Monsieur Gottfried b are such that he would 
seize upon any occasion TO PUT ME IN THE WRONG BEFORE A COURT OF

him my solemn assurance that I will be co-liable for the £100, and 
await further proposals. Or would Freiligrath, e.g., be sufficient 
reference for me? The point is that the business would have to be

great pleasure if you were to write as often as your time allows. But 
you must not expect an exactly equal  response,  as my time is in any 
case scarcely sufficient now for the multifarious correspondence

266. Marx to Kugelmann. 11 October 1867 441 
'Geneva speech'3  in 4 languages, French, German, English, and 
Russian. He has, furthermore, provided it with a baroque and 
tasteless preface, overladen with quotations. Between ourselves— 
and in the interests of the party—I must tell you the plain truth. 
Borkheim is a capable man and even an homme d'esprit* But when 
he takes up the pen, beware! All tact and taste leave him. Nor 
has he the necessary education. He is like those savages who 
imagine that they are enhancing their appearance by tattooing 
their faces with all possible gaudy colours. Banality and sen­
sationalism always get the better of him. Almost his every phrase 
instinctively dons cap and bells. If he were not so vain through 
and through, I could have prevented the publication and made it 
clear to him that it was his good fortune that people had not 
understood him in Geneva except for a few good POINTS from his 
SPEECH. On the other hand, I owe him a debt of gratitude for the 
part he played in the Vogt affair, 494 and he is a personal friend of 
mine. There are in his speech, etc., a number of phrases in which 
he has fatuously  garbled11  certain views of mine. My enemies (Vogt 
has already hinted in the Neue Zürcher-Zeitung that I am the secret 
author of the speech d) will now have the greatest fun in making 
me responsible for Mr Borkheim, his follies and eccentricities, 
instead of attacking my book If anything of that kind should 
occur, you will have to use Warnebold, etc., to place some short 
articles in the newspapers to which you have access, to expose 
these tactics and, without insulting Borkheim in any way, 
nevertheless to state quite plainly that only ill intention or an 
exceedingly uncritical mind could identify things that are so 
disparate. The baroque and confused manner in which our views 
are reflected in Borkheim's mind (from the moment he ceases to 
speak and starts to write), will naturally offer the vile PRESS-GANG the 
most welcome excuse for an offensive and might even indirectly 
serve to harm my book. 
However, if, as I scarcely dare to hope, since Borkheim is 
meticulously despatching his progeny to all the newspapers, the 
press says nothing about it, you must do absolutely nothing to break 
this solemn silence.

same time my vexation. Here one is presenting to the public a 
work that has cost much trouble to write (and perhaps no work of 
this kind has ever been written in more difficult circumstances), 
with the purpose of giving the greatest possible lift to the party 
and of disarming even ill-disposed critics by the very method of its 
exposition, and at that same moment a member of the party clad 
in cap, bells and motley insists on standing next to one in the 
market-place and provokes a barrage of rotten apples and eggs, 
which may hit one in the head even as a party member! 
Your manoeuvres against Vogt in Geneva have greatly satisfait 3 
me. 487 I am glad you like my book. 
Concerning your questions: 
Ernest Jones had to speak as a party man to Irish men in 
Ireland, in other words, since the big landownership there is 
identical with English proprietorship of  Ireland,  he had to speak 
against the big landownership. You must never look for any 
matters of principle in HUSTINGS SPEECHES by English politicians, but 
only for what is immediately expedient. 
Peonage is the advancing of money against future labour. The 
consequences of these advances are the same as with ordinary 
usury. The worker does not merely remain in debt throughout his 
life, thus performing forced labour for his creditor, but the 
relationship is inherited by the family and the next generation, 
who thus actually belong to the creditor.495 
The completion of my second volume418  depends chiefly on the 
success of the first. This I require in order to find a publisher in 
England, and, without the latter, my material circumstances will 
remain so difficult and disruptive that I shall be able to find 
neither time nor peace for speedy completion. Naturally, these are 
things which I do not wish Mr Meissner to know. It thus now 
depends on how skilful and active my party friends in Germany 
are, whether the second volume takes a long or a short time to 
appear. Considered criticism—whether from friend or foe—can 
only be expected to appear gradually, as one needs time to read 
and digest such a compendious and, in parts, difficult work. But 
its immediate success will not be decided by considered criticism, 
but, to put it bluntly, by making a noise and beating the drum, 
which compels even the adversaries to speak. To begin with, it is 
less important what is said than that something should be said. 
Above all, no time must be lost'.

Dear Kugelmann, 
Marx sent me your letter of the 8th,493 believing I would be 
better able to give you the right ideas for a review of his bookf 
than he could  himself.  To save trouble, I have just set out what 
are, in my opinion, the most suitable ideas for the populusg in two 
complete articles which will probably be appropriate for almost 
any bourgeois paper496; they may, however, be of use to you until 
you have worked your way through the 50 sheets'  yourself,  for 
writing both long and short articles for other publications. The

main thing is not what and how but that the book be discussed, 
and that the Fauchers, Michaelis, Roschers and Raus forced to 
express an opinion on it. In as many papers as possible, political 
and other, wherever it can be done. Long and short notices, 
provided they come thick and fast. We must make it impossible 
for these gentlemen to pursue their policy of total silence, which 
they would dearly love to try, and indeed as quickly as possible. 
Make sure you always send a copy of what is printed to Marx, so 
that we, and Meissner, too, are informed of events. 
Liebknecht is giving a pretty good account of himself in the 
Berlin cattle-shed." He is consistently voting against everything and 
also made a good maiden speech—immediately interrupted by 
Zeus Cronion Simson. And what's more, his motion 486 was the 
only sensible one. 
I hope all has been well with you since my departure.449  I have 
been back here for 2 months now, sitting at my office desk and 
frittering good time away with this lousy COMMERCE. You will have 
heard about our little Fenian coup de main b here. The affair was 
splendidly organised and executed; but the ringleaders were 
caught unfortunately. 497 
With best greetings.

Dear Moor, 
I have written Kugelmann two articles about the book from 
different points of view and sent them to him 496; I think they are 
such as almost any newspaper can take, and he can do others from 
them. That should help him a bit. 
I shall be writing to Siebel tomorrow, I must first know where 
the fellow is and how his health  is. 498 
Borkheim written  to. 131 
Liebknecht is doing very well; he has retained sufficient from us 
to realise that the only correct policy consists in voting against 
everything without exception. This he has faithfully done so far. If 
you should be writing to him again these days, you can draw his 
attention to the following: the final article of the law on freedom 
of movement reads: this law shall not apply to the Aliens' Police. 499 
With the consequence that what one gains as a North German 
citizen, one loses again as an 'alien'. It would have a great effect 
here if Liebknecht were to propose: the Aliens' Police be abolished. 
Only on the Continent does such an absurdity exist; the 
proposition would have a great effect. In fact, it would in general 
strengthen his position to suggest he chaff the bourgeois members 
with the fact that he, the communist, is obliged to champion their 
own interests despite their opposition. Liebknecht's speech was much 
better in the Kölnische Zeitung, by the way, than in the  Zukunft.** 1* 
I was very pleased to read the things about Vogt.a For all his 
manoeuvres, your attackb  has put paid to him entirely, and only 
the liberal bourgeoisie still considers him the German Véron. 
All that  Stumpf c is asking for is that you supply him with 
theoretical and factual material to explain how it comes about that 
the petty bourgeois gradually yields to the proletarian. And you 
know that as well as I do, but you just want to get out of the work. 
Of course, good old Stumpf thinks that one page of a letter would 
suffice—for him to learn how to handle the question. That, 
however, I would doubt.

Dronke? Borkheim is just as much of a scandalmonger as the

other, it will be six  OF ONE  AND  HALF  A DOZEN  OF THE  OTHER.  Dronke still has

I cannot wait to see Borkheim's 'Pearl'.e In the matter of literary 
vanity, the fellow is pure 'Yid'. 
Gumpert has a cousin staying here, ex-Electoral-Hessian, now 
Prussian lieutenant. The fellow enlisted with the Prussians, full of 
high expectations, but found the old pack-drill in full flower once 
again. Gymnastics, etc., performed by commands, parading, ramrod 
marching order, etc. Some of it may be exaggerated, but there is 
no doubt that the latest successesf have also lent a certain sanction 
to military display. The exaggeration derives from the disagree­
able impression, which the newly recruited officers have already 
received, that 9 out of every 10 of them will never reach the rank 
of staff-officer. And the fellow is just looking for an opportunity 
to extricate  himself.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 14 October 1867 
Dear FRED, 
You will see from the enclosed letter No. II from Juch that, 
although Achilles3  is dead, Beta is still alive. Juch's letter was 
probably provoked by the fact that Beta speaks well of Kinkel but 
not Freiligrath, and that Beta's article also contains some malicious 
remarks directed at Juch. When Freiligrath and Juch form an 
alliance, they are incapable of producing even a bad joke. For 
which reason I am to be incited to action, being 'thoroughly 
venomous', as Beta calls me in that vile scrawl of an article he 
wrote: 'Die Deutschen in London', which begins with the Norman 
Conquest and ends with that oily Jew Bender as the sole epitome 
of mankind in England. 
This is about the 6th time now that Mr Juch has offered me his 
stale columns b  for the purpose of 'self-glorification', for him a well 
proven tactic which he has used, successfully of course, with Blind, 
Kinkel, Freiligrath, and Heintzmann. I wrote him a few lines 
only. 111 And not to Mr. Freiligrath's liking either. I told him 
privatim of what happened at Beta's How do you do? editorial office 
when I went there in the company of Ziegenhainer, Freiligrath, 
and our W.  Wolff. 501 So as to give him one bad joke for his 
trouble, I told him that I would not allow Kinkel the credit for 
being more than the a and o> to this Beta. 
Typical of Juch: he sends me Payne's people's calendar502  which 
contains the corpus delicti (like all such abominations in Germany, 
Gartenlaube, etc., this calendar has 250,000 subscribers), along with 
the inevitable invoice for lid., which I immediately enclosed with 
my reply. Though admittedly he was once more on the threshold 
of the BANKRUPTCY COURT and has with great difficulty SETTLED with 
his creditors for monthly payments of 2s. 6d. in the £.

to him 131 that I will give him a guarantee for the £150 (having at the 
same time increased the amount) and am prepared to give him

and asked him whether in these circumstances he can raise the

MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 65 
IN HANOVER 
[London,] 15 October 1867 
Dear Kugelmann, 
You must not write to Borkheim. It would be poindess in any 
case as the work a has already been announced in the Buchhändler­
börsenblatt*'  and is being already published by Schabelitz. Moreover, 
Borkheim himself is now in Bordeaux: such a letter from you 
could have no effect whatsoever except to make an enemy of 
Borkheim for me. 505 
Ce qui  est fait, est fait c NEVER  MIND!  It was just that, my mind being 
in a turmoil from working all night, I AT FIRST exaggerated the 
gravity of the événement? And indeed, je suis puni par où j'ai péché! e 
You see I was amused au premier  abord 1 by the thought of the 
scandal that our friend would create amongst the respectable 
philistines of Geneva. Of course, I did not foresee the fruits it 
would bear in the book trade. I should, moreover, have reflected that, 
in working out his plan, Borkheim would naturally overstep the 
bounds of prudence which I suggested to him in my letter. 469 The 
only policy we can pursue now is silence, for as long as our 
opponents do not speak; as soon as they speak and attempt to 
hold me responsible, we must make bad jokes about their being 
obliged to burden me with Borkheim's pranks in order not to have 
to reply to my book.8  Borkheim ought furthermore to be treated 
indulgently in that event, for  AFTER  ALL, except for his literary vanity, 
he is a capable and well-meaning man, and good as an homme 
d'action^ as long as his sense of devilry does not get the better of 
him. 
You will probably already have received Engels' recipes. 496 I am 
in correspondence with Liebknecht and Becker. 1 
By the 'success of the book', I only meant that it should sell 
quickly, on account of the effect this will have back in England.

IN MANCHESTER 
London, 19 October 1867 
DEAR FRED, 
As regards Borkheim, I told him: what Engels wrote is final and 
is not subject to 'negotiation'. He (today he left for Bordeaux) let 
himself be ruled by me to the extent of paying out £40 to me and 
promising TO  FIND THE REST  by 10 November without further 
prevarication if you were unable, etc. But as a businessman and a 
Jew he had to make just one more attempt! 
Incidentally, Borkheim has just had a hugely gratifying experi­
ence.  Schabelitz put an exceedingly bombastic notice of Bor-
kheim's 'Perle" 3 in the Buchhändlerbörsenblattf in which Borkheim is 
featured as Peter the Hermit vis-à-vis Russia  WELL!  The Moscow 
Newspaper 0 has printed this (in translation) as a curiosity, and he 
thus had the pleasure of seeing himself and his name in print in 
Russian] He showed me a copy and interpreted it for me.

Lafargue was put to a deal of trouble translating Borkheim's 
French at least passably into French. 3 I had to give him some 
assistance, of course, especially for the quotations from Kant, 
Fichte and Hegel, which Borkheim probably did not quite 
understand even in German. But he has these gentlemen in his 
library. 
I am glad the matter is thus SETTLED. In recent weeks I have 
found it perfectly impossible to write for more than maybe 2 
hours.  Apart from the incursions FROM WITHOUT, there are all the 
aggravations of home life, which I always find especially nerve-
racking. I have been suffering from insomnia again and had the 
pleasure of seeing 2 small carbuncles blossom near the membrum. 
Fortunately, they have faded away. My sickness always originates 
in the mind. While on the subject of the membrum, may I 
commend the following lines to you for Moore from the French 
satirist of the 16th century, Mathurin Régnier. Well-read though I 
am in this field, I do not think that chaude pisse has ever been 
more poetically described: 
Mon cas, qui se lève et se hausse, 
Bave d'une estrange façon; 
Belle, vous fournîtes la sausse, 
Lors que je fournis le poisson. 
Las! si ce membre eut l'arrogance 
De fouiller trop les lieux sacrés, 
Qu'on lui pardonne son offence, 
Car il pleure assez ses péchés. b 
And this by the same poet is not bad either: 
Fluxion D'Amour 
L'amour est une affection 
Qui,  par les yeux, dans le cœur entre, 
a See this volume, pp. 435-36. 
b My will, which riseth up in pride, 
Doth spout most curiously; 
The sauce, my love, thou didst provide, 
The fish it was from me. 
Ah, did that member overween 
To delve the sacred place? 
Pray pardon him his grievous sin, 
He weepeth his disgrace. 
M. Régnier, Stances.

Lui dit: Mon cœur, pousse toujours,

And at her belly lunges low. 
She, hoping that he her would kill, 
Tells him, my heart it yearneth still, 
I fear I shall my fate forego,

Tells her, oh haste thee now and die,

H. Meyer was here the day before yesterday en route for

Let me have your recipesc  for the German newspapers. I will 
have them copied out and find the most suitable PLACEMENTS. They

asking for something of the kind for over there and will put them

is the most important thing, for success here depends largely on what 
happens there—you must write a critique for The Fortnightly

a soul notices it) of Comteist persuasion, but wishes to provide an 
outlet for every point of view. If your critique arouses Mr Lewes' 
(the Goethe man, and unfortunately semi-Comteist, too) interest in 
the book (Lewes is secretly also CO-PROPRIETOR of the Review), it will 
be easy to find a publisher. And even without that, a publisher will 
in any case be easier to find then. The latest number contains a 
truly pitiful article by Thornton, in which he reproduces 
MALTHUSIANISM (in which the real MONGERS do not believe) in the most 
commonplace and trivial form.e 
What our party lacks is money, as the enclosed letters from 
Eccarius and Becker once more painfully demonstrate.510  But for 
this deficiency, we should always be, despite great and irreplace­
able losses, today as in 1848, les plus forts. 1

Dear Moor, 
The letters from Becker and Eccarius returned enclosed. 11 The 
lack of money is, of course, a great misfortune for the party, and a 
yet greater one for those poor devils. 
Siebel has written to me from Honnef on the Rhine that he is 
coming here at the beginning of November to embark at 
Liverpool again for Madeira. He says I should send him the 
articles b by return; this evening I shall set to work to knock a few 
into shape for him. What I am writing for the German press is, of 
course, all  dressed  up in disguise; I shall have to write differently for 
America, since one can take greater liberties there. 
Sam Moore has written from Eisenach; he seems to be making 
considerable progress with his German. 
I am greatly amused by Liebknecht. It is truly fortunate that he 
is still thoroughly infected with the South-German-Federalist 
nonsense and can consequently attack Bismarckism with great 
SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE and with undaunted moral indignation. A 
somewhat more critical and more dialectical outlook would only 
sow confusion in his mind and lead him astray. He has obviously 
taken Lupus in the Frankfurt Parliament 511 as his model and has 
properly earned his call to order by describing the Reichstag 
as the fig-leaf of naked absolutism. You will have seen that he has 
inserted a paragraph for the protection of factory children in the 
combination law.5 
The Party of Progress" has rejected the Commission of Inquiry 
as not being within the competence of the Reichstag.504 The 
Confederation is, however, competent to deal with all matters of 
trade and industry, only the Reichstag cannot appoint a 
commission, although it can indeed request the Federal authority 
to do so. 
In the interest debate Bismarck has rejected the idea of granting 
the mortgage banks state assistance, saying that if it is a question 
of state support, this could only be approved for the workers' 
a See this volume, p. 455. - b on the first volume of Capital

Victor Emmanuel appears to be playing a most risky game. For 
all that, the Roman fracas is not yet over.5'3 The air is becoming

I'm glad the Borkheim business is straight now. Under no 
circumstances can I give Gottfried Ermen a pretext just now to 
terminate his contract with me on the grounds of direct breach of 
contract. I hope the money drives away your carbuncles; don't 
forget to take plenty of exercise in the open air. 
I shall be glad to do the thing for The Fortnightly Review?09 But 
you must let me know about how much space I am allowed for it. 
I presume you will prefer me to summarise, so as briefly to give 
the main points of the bookb—origin of capital—surplus-value— 
working day—revision of Ricardo's laws, etc., etc., after all I really 
cannot criticise the thing. I should also like to know approximately 
when the thing must be complete. It is too late for the 1 
November number, so for the 1 December number it will have to be.

Just how far Dizzyb has contrived not merely to DISH the Whigs 
but to disorganise the Tories, too, was demonstrated to me the day 
before yesterday in a conversation with two of that ilk. They were 
agreed: 
1. that the Irish Church and thus the Established Church in 
England, too, should fall forthwith, 
2. that the  LAWS  OF PRIMOGENITURE  AND  ENTAIL514 are no longer tenable,

But the likes of us, who only live once, may well never live to see

Letter enclosed from the German communist association.515 Well 
meant. But strangely loutish in style. 
Enclosed letter from Maughan, man of private means, old 
Owenite, very decent fellow. These people are obviously intending 
to emancipate the FREETHINK movement from the PROFESSIONAL 
AGITATORS Bradlaugh, etc. I very politely declined.516 On the one 
hand, it is true that I would thereby have had the chance, which I 
am wanting so much, of becoming acquainted with all manner of 
people who are to a greater or lesser extent, directly or indirectly, 
connected with the English press. On the other hand, I have not 
the time, nor do I think it right that I should figure on the LEADING 
COMMITTEE of any English sect. 
A certain Auberon Herbert,3  brother of the EARL OF CARNARVON 
and COUSIN to Stepney (who is member of our CENTRAL COUNCIL) and 
much dabbling in socialism (I.E.. CO-OPERATIVE  DODGES,  etc.), has asked 
Stepney to arrange a rendezvous with me. As I first want to have 
sight of the man and smell him over, I have made an appointment 
to see him next Tuesday at the Cleveland Hall, where we hold our 
meetings. This 'channel' (Vogt) 517 may perhaps prove useful for 
reaching publishers.

I don't know whether you are familiar with the course of the

except Rome, in exchange for offensive alliance against Prussia in 
the event of war.518 But when the Prussian hornets' nest376 turned 
into good will to all men, Mr Bonaparte began to regret the thing 
and with his usual cunning attempted to betray Emmanuel and 
make advances to Austria. As we all know, nothing came of it in 
Salzburg either,519 and so for a while the witches' cauldron that is 
Europe appeared not to seethe. Meanwhile the Russian gentlemen, 
who had as usual procured a copy of the agreement, thought the 
moment had come to inform Mr Bismarck of it, who, in his turn, 
had the Prussian envoy3 lay it before the Pope.b Whereupon, at 
the Pope's instigation, the pamphlet written by Bishop Dupanloup 
of Orleans.520 On the other side, Garibaldi set on by Emmanuel. 
Subsequently: Rattazzi dismissed as an enemy of Prussia and 
Bonapartist. Hence the present imbroglio!1 That scoundrel 
Bonaparte is now up to his eyes in the mire. War, not just with 
Italy, but Prussia and Russia, and in a cause which in France 
enjoys the most fanatical hatred of Paris, etc., hated in England, 
etc.—or yet another retreat! The fellow attempted to save himself 
by appealing to Europe, a European Congress. But Prussia and 
England have already sent him their reply, that, having made his 
bed, he must now lie on it. The fellow does not know what year it 
is. He is no longer secret general to Russia and Europe. 
If retreat, then with present corn-prices, business in crisis and 
disaffection in France revolution is possible ONE FINE MORNING. 
One good thing about our Bismarck—although he is the chief 
instrument of Russian intrigues—is that he is pushing things 
towards crisis in France. However, in respect of our German 
philistines, their entire past has shown that unity can only be 
imposed on them by the grace of God and the sabre. 
The Fenian trial in Manchester exactly as was to be expected.497

We must adopt a different approach. Have you Liebknecht's 
present address, or alternatively his old one in Leipzig? If you let 
me have it, I will spur him on a bit. I now realise that I shall have 
to write all the articles myself (Eccarius could probably also do 
one);  the people on the Continent are finding the book is still 
lying too heavily on the stomach, and, if we are to wait until they 
have digested it, the opportunity will have been missed. I shall 
write to Kugelmann again, too, a asking him at least what he has 
done with the other article and whether he can place any more.523 
You must write to Meissner and ask whether he can place any if 
they are sent to him, and where. In addition, I shall write to Klein 
in Cologne about the Rheinische Zeitung, and offer an article if 
need be. It is a dreadful handicap not being on the spot  oneself.  If 
we were in Germany, we should already have created a stir in all 
the papers, and have managed to get the book denounced, which is 
always the best thing. 
Louis b in Paris does not know which way to turn. What a mess 
he has got himself into! Either another retreat or war on behalf of 
the Pope.c I can hardly believe that he has really served the 
Italians an ultimatum to evacuate Roman territory, no more than I 
can believe that he can let things rest with Moustier's churlish 
note.524  In either case, he is foutu.d  The present mood in Paris was 
shown at the cimetière Montmartre. 525 Things may begin to happen 
any day now, and I hardly believe that the great man will celebrate 
another 2 December," or at least it will probably be for the last 
time.  He is in such a bad way that even the philistines here only 
treat him as a common adventurer now. 
If the storm does break, however, the revolution will everywhere 
be faced with a quite different situation from 1848. After last year, 
the disorganisation of that time will be out of the question in 
Germany, and even if an immediate violent uprising in Berlin has 
little chance, the impact of events would provoke clashes there, 
too, which would inevitably end in the downfall of the present 
regime. Monsieur Bismarck would very soon lose command of the 
situation. And then this time England would be dragged in 
straightaway and ABOVE ALL the social question would at once 
become the burning issue throughout Europe.

detailed report (perhaps broken down into several articles)  to the 
Austrian Internationale Revue (Arnold Hilberg's publishing house,  4, 
Kolowrat-Ring, Vienna).  As  Arnold Hilberg lists  you and me as his 
contributors  (and  through  me has  asked  us  both  for  contribu­
tions),  there  are no  obstacles here.  It is in  fact  the  sole German 
'Review' which  is open  to us. 
The only weekly paper here  in London which  has a  certain 
impartiality  and is  much concerned with things German, such  as 
German philology, natural science, Hegel,  etc., is  a—Catholic 
paper,  The  Chronicle.  It is  obviously their tendency  to show that 
they are  more learned than their Protestant rivals.  I sent them  ONE 
COPY3  at the end of last week with  A SHORT LETTER  TO THE PURPOSE,  saying 
that my  book does  not  share their opinions,  but  that  the  'scholarly' 
nature of their paper suggests  THAT SOME NOTICE WILL  BE TAKEN  or rms 
FIRST  ATTEMPT  AT  APPLYING  THE  DIALECTIC  METHOD  TO  POLITICAL ECONOMY'.1 
Nous verrons !b There  is a  great desire prevailing  at present  in the 
more refined circles  (I am  referring,  of course,  to the  INTELLECTUAL 
portion  of the  latter)  to become acquainted with  the  dialectical 
method.  And  perhaps that  is after  all the  easiest  way to get at the 
English. 
The most interesting thing  in the  enclosed Diplomatic Review  is 
the excerpts from  the new  book  by  Prokesch.c 
Detailed description of Abercorn's  EVICTIONS  appeared  ABOUT  a

The idea about the Internationale Revue had already occurred to 
me, too, and shall be attended to. Likewise with The Fortnightly

however, I believe it is most important to create a rumpus in the 
German daily press, pour forcer la main à ces gueux  d'économistes.* 
The DowNBREAK of the police in the trial here has been more 
rapid and more complete than I had expected. But there is 
probably even better to come.  OLD  Blackburn also appears to be 
changing his tune, today he complimented Ernest Jones most 
fulsomely on his speech.497 
Have you read Bismarck's instructions to Usedom (in the 
Augsburger Abendzeitung* denied, of course 518)? The fellow is 
making no bones about exposing the Italians' intrigues with 
Bonaparte; one has to grant him that he is capable of the most 
undiplomatic manners if it suits him. (Kölnische Zeitung of 
Wednesday has reprinted it.) This stance of Bismarck's also 
explains the Italians' retreat and their present grovelling. 
Concerning the true nature of the inspections, checks and 
interferences of the Prussian bureaucracy: my brother writes that 
the manufacturers want to set up an association on the Rhine and 
in the Ruhr, like the ones here, to have their boilers periodically 
examined by competent engineers, and he goes on to say of the 
government control: 
'Here at our place, a District Architect inspects 7 boilers in half an hour (!!) and 
goes home quite satisfied, in another factory a similar official took 2 hours for 35 
boilersU If anyone is so foolish as to imagine he can sleep soundly after such an 
inspection, he is, of course, deceived. It would be a real blessing if this nonsense 
were done away with and replaced by some sensible practical arrangement. At one 
inspection, I first explained the boiler with all its fittings to the District Architect, 
then I carried out his instructions as well and finally wrote the report for the 
government for him.' 
There are the Prussians for you! Portrayed by themselves.

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 522 
IN HANOVER 
Manchester, 8 and 20 November 1867 
Dear Kugelmann, 
Since my last letter" neither Marx nor I have heard anything 
from you, and I can scarce believe that you are so deeply 
ensconced in some anteflexio uteri as to be entirely incommunicado. 
I have, moreover, a letter to send to Liebknecht, and Marx advises 
me to forward it to you, as we do not have the exact address and 
do not know whether he is in Berlin or Leipzig; I am therefore 
enclosing it. 131 
The German press is still observing complete silence in respect 
of Capital, and it really is of the greatest importance that 
something should be said. I have discovered that one of the 
articles'3  I sent you is in the Zukunft; I am sorry I did not know 
that it might eventually be destined for that paper; one could 
probably have taken greater liberties there. However, it does not 
matter. The main thing is that the book should be discussed over 
and over again, in any way whatsoever. And as Marx is not a free 
agent in the matter, and is furthermore as bashful as a young girl, 
it is up to the rest of us to see to it. Please be so kind therefore 
and let me know what success you have so far had in the matter, 
and which papers you think you may still be able to use. In the 
words of our old friend Jesus Christ, we must be innocent as 
doves and wise as serpents. 0 The good old vulgar economists at 
least have enough intelligence to treat the book with respect and 
to take good care not to talk of it if they are not obliged to. And 
that is what we must compel them to do. If the book is being 
discussed in 15-20 newspapers at once—never mind whether 
favourably or not, whether in articles, regular features or 
unsolicited pieces in the correspondence section—even if merely 
as a phenomenon of some significance that merits attention, then 
the whole crowd of them will start yapping away, too, of their own 
accord, and the Fauchers, Michaelis, Roschers, and Max Wirths 
will then have to do the same. We have a moral obligation to

damned well get these articles into the papers, and as near 
simultaneously as possible, especially the European ones, and that 
includes the reactionary ones. In the latter, we might point out 
that the vulgarian gentlemen make a deal of noise in parliaments 
and economic gatherings, but now, when they are confronted with 
the consequences of their own science, they prefer to keep their 
mouths shut. And so forth. If you think my assistance would be 
desirable, let me know which paper you wish to have something 
for—in the service of the party I am always on call. The letter to 
Liebknecht concerns the same business, and you will therefore 
oblige me exceedingly by ensuring it reaches its destination. 
The Roman affair513 has again been an absolute boon to us. The 
noble Bonaparte appears to me to be gargling his last gasp, and 
when this episode comes to an end in France, with the position in 
England becoming more revolutionary every day, and with 
revolution in Italy inescapable—, then this must surely also spell 
the end of the reign of the 'Europeans'3 in Germany. Rapid 
progress is being made here in England with the formation of a 
really revolutionary party, and revolutionary conditions are 
developing hand in hand with it. With his REFORMBILL,425 Disraeli 
has thrown the Tories into confusion and routed the Whigs, 
although all he has done is to render it impossible to continue 
dilly-dallying as before. This REFORMBILL will either prove to be 
nothing at all (and this is now impossible, there is too much 
momentum behind it), or it will infallibly and immediately bring in 
its train BILLS of an altogether different character, which will go 
much farther. The next steps, which will have to be taken 
forthwith, are the allotting of representatives in proportion to 
population and the secret ballot, and that will be the end of the 
old scheme of things here. The capital thing about Disraeli is that 
his hatred for the  COUNTRY  GENTLEMEN  in his own party and his hatred 
of the Whigs have set things going on a course which can no 
longer be halted. You will be astonished, and the German 
philistines who think England is finished will be even more 
astonished, at what will happen here once the REFORMBILL is in 
force. The Irish are also doing their bit to keep things properly on 
the boil, and every day the London proletarians are more openly 
declaring their support for the Fenians,237 in other words, and this 
is without precedent here and really splendid, for a movement 
that firstly advocates the use of force and secondly is anti-English.

riding amply demonstrated, and you will see how quickly all your 
complaints and reservations about drink disappear thanks to an 
hour's riding daily. As a gynaecologist, you owe it to science, for 
after all gynaecology is intimately connected with riding or being 
ridden, and a gynaecologist must therefore be in every sense the

20 November. Since I wrote the above, Marx has communicated 
to me your letter to him,b and I am sorry to see from it that we 
can hardly count on further press-notices in your locality. Might it 
not be possible, perhaps through third persons, to get attacks on 
the book, either from a bourgeois or a reactionary point of view, 
into some of the papers? This seems to me to be one means of 
publicity, and there would be no difficulty in producing the 
articles. And then: what about scientific journals, or purely literary 
or semi-literary ones? 
Respecting the Rheinische Zeitung, I am writing to Cologne in 
case there has still been no progress. 523 
Büchner ought to be able to get things into the papers as well; 
you can refer him to me for the articles if necessary. Give him no 
peace. 
I have still not received the photographs, but they are sure to 
come one of these days.

Dear Moor, 
What touching gaucheness in dear old Kugelmann's letter! And 
what discernment of character in respect of that Warnebold! The 
fellow extracts all his secrets from him, and all the while he is a 
Prussian spy! You must tell Kugelmann the truth about that

of our activities.528 The cur is abusing your confidences, which 
absolves you from any obligation toward him. 
I saw Siebel yesterday in Liverpool. I fear the poor devil's days 
are numbered. Since I last saw him, his desease has advanced 
considerably, his health broke down in Barmen, he has had 3 
successive attacks of pleurisy and is coughing very violently (he 
calls them coughing-spasms, and they recur periodically), however 
he has lately regained some of his health and strength at Honnef 
on the Rhine. Unfortunately, I could only speak to him alone for 
a short while, there were always several relatives there apart from 
his wife. Despite that, we settled the most important things. 
D'abord3 : Siebel has up to the present moment neither received a 
copy h nor even seen one, although he wrote to Meissner asking to be 
sent one by post immediately on publication. Mr Rittershaus, 
however, who has not lifted a finger, has received one, and Siebel 
thought you had not sent him one at all, but had done so to 
Rittershaus, which may have piqued him. I naturally explained the 
true position to him, but a few lines from you to him, which you 
can enclose in a letter to me, really are called for. But you must 
now take Meissner to task forthwith for this negligence. This affair 
has cost us 20 short notices which Siebel would immediately have 
had in all the papers, but could not because he did not have the 
book. Furthermore, I must have a copy here by 22 November at the 
latest to send to Siebel in Madeira, where he will make up for lost 
time as far as he can. But really what can one say to such a 
slapdash approach? And these are the Germans who are 
demanding self-government and  CANNOT  LOOK  AFTER  THEIR  OWN  BUSINESS! 
Of the 3 articles I took with me, we sent off 2 to the Frankfurter 
Börsenzeitung 0 and to the Düsseldorfer Zeitung 529 forthwith—the 
latter will do Mr Heinrich Bürgers good, with his circumspect 
scruples: my article d—a very simple report, which makes no 
judgments and was composed for a national-liberal newspaper—is 
too dubious for that brute!523  Siebel took the 3rd with him, it will 
probably go to the Barmer Zeitung. 550 Notices will also appear in all 
kinds of illustrated and other papers, as soon as Siebel himself has 
the book. Furthermore, the Weser-Zeitung will receive an article a 
tempo"  from him for its literary section, and one on the book, and 
will be faced only with the choice of taking both or neither. (Siebel 
is using the literary section articles as a bait for editors, they are 
desperate for them, and he often lets them pocket the fee

themselves.) Other ideas will occur to him as soon as he has the 
book. 
Ad vocem3  Freiligrath: that worthy's debts amounted to approx. 
£6,000, £4,000 with the Swiss Bank advanced for shares in the 
Mansfield Co. which are now worthless, and the rest debts of 
honour. The Comité 422 has settled these debts at 5% dividend, a 
few of them at 10%. Freiligrath has thus gone bankrupt in optima 
forma. b The collection will amount to approx. 30,000 talers. 
Freiligrath is said to have lied to the Comité through and through, 
concealed his debts and pretended his wife knew nothing of it and 
must not be allowed to know anything of it either, so that 
eventually they were very rude to him; even on the day when he 
knew that a letter was to arrive from London to say that the debts 
of honour totalled £2,000, he was still saying they were only 
£1,500, etc. In short, his conduct has been disgraceful and 
cowardly. I said I was quite convinced that dear old Ida c knew all 
about it, to which he replied: how was it then possible for her to 
give fêtes 6 last summer in Barmen? Just imagine, Ida goes 
a-begging and at the same time holds fêtes for the people she is 
begging from with the money that has not yet been given! 
I am surprised Tussye has not yet sent me a receipt for my 
contribution to the Freiligrath funeral-fund. THAT  IS NOT  BUSINESSLIKE.

Kugelmann has sent me a copy of the Deutsche Volkszeitung 
(Hanover) containing a short notice of my book' written by 
himself.  In it, Kugelmann has imitated one of your articles, d and 
by no means happily. As this paper is democratic, he could have 
gone into the content more. Among other things, he has me arrive 
'at the' admittedly 'astonishing conclusion that all capital is derived 
from unpaid labour power1 . Among the 'German authorities on 
political economy' whose 'verdict' he seeks, Mr 'Faucher' (fortu­
nately printed as 'Taucher') appears at the head of the list and 
Roscher at the end. 
Your 'revelations' in respect of Freiligrath have created a great 
sensation here at home.

Manchester, 24 November 1867 
Dear Moor, 
The letters returned enclosed. 
So, yesterday morning, and by Mr Colcraft's hand, the Tories 
have really performed the ultimate act of separation between 
England and Ireland. The only thing the Fenians still lacked were 
martyrs. Derby and G. Hardy have now provided them with these. 
It was the execution of those 3a which will transform the liberation 
of Kelly and Deasy into an act of heroism, such as will now be 
sung at the cradle of every Irish child in Ireland, England and 
America. The Irish women will see to that as surely as did the 
Polish womenfolk. 
The only time that anyone has, to my knowledge, been executed 
for anything similar in a civilised state was the case of John Brown 
at Harpers ferry.533 The Fenians could not wish for a better 
precedent. And yet even the SOUTHERNERS had the decency to treat 
J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here no effort is spared to convert an 
act of political violence into a common crime. 
Everybody knows that while he was leading his band of ruffians 
at Boulogne, Louis Napoleon shot the duty-officer dead.534 He

thus did what Allen is supposed to have done but did not do. For 
which the English government hangs Allen, while the English 
queena kisses Louis Napoleon's cheek and the English aristocracy 
and bourgeoisie his backside. 
The latter point should be made in the press.

Dear Moor, 
I have not received the promised letter in quo tua res agebatur. b 
Meissner's proposal to send out new notices with excerpts from 
the reviews was what I had in mind to suggest to you as soon as 
Siebel's articles (i.e. the ones I gave himc ) appear. The excerpt 
from the Zukunft is quite good, 535 but a few more would be even 
better; he should send you the whole caboodle, and you can then 
prepare a notice from it. Or if you do not wish to, then he can 
send it to me and I will do it. I was most struck by the fact that the 
first notice took up precisely the same space as the one for my little 
pamphlet,d and it had not a word of commentary with it.536 
If the matter does not turn out differently soon, then / shall 
have to write—with your consent  OF COURSE—to  Meissner and offer 
him articles written by myself for newspapers to be specified by 
him. I am sure that could not compromise you.

Dear Engels, 
With regard to my private business (I intended writing to you 
on Saturdaye but was prevented on that and on the following days 
by people consulting me from every side about the FENIAN AFFAIRS,497 
etc., in short, they were confiscating my time), Mr Borkheim— 
despite the best of intentions, I am sure—has throughout this 
month kept me suspended between frying pan and fire. You will 
see from his latest letter, of yesterday, that we are again faced with 
a new, indefinite delay. The worst part of it all is that he had 
positively promised me he would pay out the whole sum on the

10th of this month (at the latest), and I had made my dispositions 
with the creditors accordingly. The amount he has actually paid 
since he returned is £5. So, you will realise what TROUBLE I find 
myself in. The state of my health has greatly worsened, and there 
has been virtually no question of working. I am furthermore 
expecting summonses any day, and we no longer know which way 
to turn from one day to the next. 
With regard to Meissner, my view is that we should let him have 
a free hand with his notice, as everything else would mean further 
delay. Thimm told Borkheim that Meissner had requested all the 
booksellers to send any still unsold copies 3 back to him (or to his 
agent in Leipzig). I have also heard from York, the Workers' 
Society"1  bookseller, that it is at the moment very difficult to obtain 
copies from Meissner. To me this indicates no more than 1. that 
the STOCK in Meissner's hands is very small, 2. that he wants to 
know how much of the STOCK not in his hands is really sold, 3. he 
wants to force his business 'friends' to hold as much as possible at 
their own expense. I shall write to Meissner that should he need 
notices or reviews for certain newspapers or journals (and he must 
tell me which), he can obtain them from friends such as  yourself, 
etc. Must keep me informed. 
Dr Contzen, private lecturer in political economy at Leipzig, 
PARTISAN and pupil of Roscher and friend of Liebknecht, has asked 
me through the latter for a copy with the promise of a detailed 
review. You will see that this has already been attended to through 
Meissner. Contzen is a good opening. 
Liebknecht has sent me 50 of his PAMPHLETS 0 (of which I am 
sending you one today) for sale here, 3d. each. Lessner is seeing 
what can be done in the Workers' Society. 
The extract from Liebknecht's SPEECH at the Berlin Workers' 
Society4"' on the deferment of the 'social question' which he has 
published as an appendix admittedly gives some grounds for 
Kugelmann's censure.537  As Liebknecht is asking you, among other 
things, to contribute to the little paper he is planning, 538 you can 
give him a few hints privatim about how to combine political 
opposition with social agitation.

Forgive me for leaving your two letters unanswered for so long. 
Many things were to blame for this, but above all the fact that 
yarns were certain not to go up for the time being and—with no 
demand from you at the moment—there was thus no danger in 
delay. 
The SEWINGS we normally send out bleached and dyed in the

send to you. (36/45 Taylor, finer No. Knowles.) But we can have 
these COPS doubled by a DOUBLER for you here, and the SEWINGS would

some of this last spring, bale No. 319, delivery note 9 April, so 
you can compare whether you need this cheaper product or 
whether you must have the more expensive yarns with real SEWING 
TWIST. 
We are all expecting a drop in prices here in view of the 
exceptionally good American harvest. MIDDLING was selling at 
672 FREE  ON BOARD in New Orleans. However, the spinning 
business is very much in the doldrums just now, and so when 
things first pick up again yarn might well remain stable, even if 
there is a fall in cotton. The fine nos. will hold their own best, the 
ORDINARY fine DOUBLES being already cheaper than in 1860 (16d. as 
against 18d. for 6O/RFOLD). The prices I gave you overleaf are 
approximately the same as those at the end of 1859 and the 
beginning of 1860, the more expensive 60s being then at 2s. 5d., 
the 40s at 19d., and the cheaper 60s was anything a little more 
expensive then. I cannot make an exact comparison as we were not 
using the same threads in those days. 
Otherwise everything is pretty much as usual here. From time to 
time,  a bit of a tussle, now with Anton, now with Gottfried,1* 
ensures that our old love never fades. 
I am wishing myself many happy returns of my birthday today 
from all of you, and send you all my very best wishes. I shall be 
answering mother'sb letter one day soon.131

DEAR FRED, 
BEST  THANKS FOR THE £30. 
Letter from Kugelmann returned enclosed. We must watch out 
that he doesn't commit any stupidities in his enthusiasm. Such as 
with Miquel, for example. 528 
As regards the paper of the United States of Europe3—and the

Dear Moor, 
Schily returned enclosed. 539 Oh, Lord, have mercy upon us, here 
comes olle Moses3 pissing up to us again! And he is congratulating 
himself that you certified he was right when he asserted that 
capital is accumulated labour! 
I would be just the tiniest bit reticent in respect of that worthy. 
He will then take the bait all the more surely, and you know how 
little we can trust him if we have not made quite sure of him. In 
my view, for the present you could permit him to publish a few 
extracts from itb  in the Courrier français, so that we may see how 
he proposes to handle the thing. He will naturally put his 
signature to these, and we shall thereby again have him to some 
degree qualified as a repentant sinner. Then you could talk about 
the translation of the whole book which he is envisaging; your 
right of revision always reserved; and discuss conditions as soon as 
a publisher has been found. What Schily says of Reclus seems 
important to me, as the man knows German. 
You are perfectly right about the Fenians.c The vile deeds of the 
English must not allow us to forget that most of the leaders of this 
sect are jackasses and some of them exploiters, and that we can, 
under no circumstances, make ourselves responsible for the 
idiocies that are perpetrated in any conspiracy. That there will be 
some, is certain. 
I need hardly tell you that black and greend are the prevailing 
colours in my house, too. The English press has again conducted 
itself abominably.497 Larkin is said to have fainted, and the otherse 
to have looked pale and confused. The Catholic priests who were 
there declare that is a lie. Larkin, they say, stumbled over an 
irregularity in the ground and all three showed great courage.

The Catholic Bishop of Salford complained bitterly that Allen 
refused to repent of his deed, saying he had nothing to repent, 
and if he were free, he would do the same thing again. The 
Catholic priests, incidentally, were very impudent, it was stated 
from the pulpit in every church on Sunday that  THESE  THREE  MEN  WERE 
MURDERED. 
You will have received my letter of yesterday with the £30.a As 
regards the life assurance,0  I am willing to guarantee the sum 
concerned, provided that Borkheim retains the original in his own 
keeping and merely gives the secretary a  copy,  in the hope that this 
will facilitate matters. 
I agree that the furuncles appear to mark the crisis of the 
previous illness. 
Best regards to your wife, the girls and Lafargue. 
Now that Liebknecht has got a little paper, 538 for which we shall 
be held responsible, it is very important that he does nothing 
stupid in respect of his German policy. I am most impatient for a 
letter from him. 
Apropos. From 1 January the Internationale Revue will appear as

prevent  him  from misusing  us.  Regarding Hilberg,  it would 
indeed  be a  good thing  if we  could keep  a hold  on  this Revue,3 
being  the  only  one  still open  to us, but  how?  is not yet  clear  to me. 
This morning I received a  COPY  of Schorlemmerb  AND  SEND  HIM MY 
THANKS  FOR IT. 
If you  have read  the  papers,  you  will have seen that  1. the 
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL  sent  MEMORIAL  for the  FENIANS542  to Hardy, 
2. the  debate  on  FENIANISM  (a week  ago  last Tuesdayc) was public  and 
The Times carried  a REPORT  on it.d  There were also  REPORTERS  there 
from  the  Dublin Irishman  and  Nation.  I did not  arrive until very 
late (I have been suffering from  a fever  for  about  2 weeks,  and 
have only  got  over  it in the  last  2 days)  and had not in  fact 
intended  to speak, first  on  account  of my  uncomfortable physical 
condition,  and  second because  of the  delicacy  of the  situation. 
However,  the  CHAIRMAN  Weston wanted  to force  me to, so I  moved 
ADJOURNMENT,  which obliged  me to  speak last Tuesday.6 What  I had 
in fact prepared for  TUESDAY LAST  was not a  SPEECH  but rather the 
POINTS  for  A SPEECH.'  However, the  IRISH REPORTERS  did not come, and 
by the  time  we had  finished waiting  for  them  it was 9  o'clock, 
whereas  the  premises were only available  to us  until IOV2-  At my 
suggestion, Fox had prepared a long  SPEECH  (because of a  QUARREL 
on the  COUNCIL  he had  made  no  appearance  for 2  weeks,  and 
furthermore sent in his  RESIGNATION  as  MEMBER  OF THE  COUNCIL 
containing furious outbursts against Jung543 ). When  the  séance* 
opened  I therefore declared that,  on  account  of the  BELATED HOUR,  I 
would yield  the  floor  to Fox. In  fact—because  the  executions  in 
Manchester  had  intervened—our subject  'FENIANISM'  was  bound  up 
with the  passions  and  heated emotions  of the  moment, which 
would have compelled  me  (though  not the  abstract  Fox) to  unleash 
a revolutionary thunderbolt, instead  of the  intended objective 
analysis  of the  situation  and the  movement.  The  Irish  REPORTERS 
thus did me a  great service  by  staying away  and so  delaying  the 
opening  of the  meeting.  I do not  enjoy getting embroiled with 
people like Roberts, Stephens,  and the  like. 
Fox's  SPEECH  was  good, first because  it was  delivered  by an 
Englishman,  and  second insofar  as it  dealt only with political  and 
international  ASPECTS.  However,  for  that very reason  he  only skated 
over  the  surface  of things.  The  resolution  he brought forward  was

silly and  pointless.544  I opposed  it and had it  referred back  to the 
STANDING  COMMITEE.21 
What  the  English  do not yet  realise,  is that since  1846 the 
economic content  and  hence  the  political purpose  of English rule 
in Ireland  as well  has  entered  an  entirely  new  phase,  and  that  for 
that very reason  FENIANISM  is characterised  by  socialist  (in the 
negative sense,  as  directed against  the  APPROPRIATION  of the  SOIL) 
leanings  and as a  LOWER ORDERS MOVEMENT.  What could  be more absurd 
than  to  lump together  the  barbarities  of Elizabeth  or  Cromwell, 
who wanted  to drive  out the  Irish  by  means  of English colonists 
(in the  Roman sense),  and the  present system, which wants  to 
drive  out the  Irish  by  means  of sheep, pigs  and  oxen!  The  system 
of 1801-1846  (EVICTIONS  in that period were exceptional, particular­
ly in Leinster, where  the  soil is especially suited  to cattle-raising) 
with its  RACKRENTS  and  MIDDLEMEN,  collapsed in 1846. The  ANTI-CORN-
LAW-REPEAL,  in part  a consequence  of or, at all  events, hastened  by 
the IRISH FAMINE,545  took from Ireland  its  monopoly  of  supplying 
England with corn  in normal times. Wool  and  meat became  the 
watchword, hence  CONVERSION OF  TILLAGE  INTO  PASTURE.  SO from then  on, 
SYSTEMATIC  CONSOLIDATION  OF FARMS.  The  ENCUMBERED ESTATES  ACT which 
made  LANDLORDS  of a  mass  of former  MIDDLEMEN  who  had  grown rich, 
hastened the process. 546 CLEARING  OF THE ESTATES OF IRELAND!  is now the 
sole meaning  of  English rule  in  Ireland.  The  stupid English 
government  in  London naturally knows even nothing  of  this 
IMMENSE CHANGE  since  1846. But the  Irish  do.  From Meagher's 
Proclamation (1848)547 down  to Hennessy's election address (Tory  and 
Urquhartite) (1866)  the  Irish have been expressing their awareness 
of it in the clearest and  MOST  FORCIBLE MANNER. 
The question  now is,  what advice should  we  give  the  English 
workers?  In my  view, they must make  REPEAL  of the UNION  (in  short, 
the farce  of 1783,  only democratised  and  adapted  to meet present 
circumstances)  an  article  of their pronunziamento."548 This  is the 
only legal  and  hence  the  only possible form  of Irish emancipation 
which  can be  adopted  by an  English party  in its  programme. 
Experience must later show, whether mere personal union 
between  the 2  countries  can  continue  to exist.  I half believe  it 
could  if it  comes about  in due  time. 
What  the  Irish need  is: 
1. Self-government  and  independence from England. 
2. Agrarian revolution. With  the  best will  in the  world  the 
a manifesto 

=====第525页=====
296. Marx to Schily. 30 November 1867 487 
English cannot do this for them, but they can give them the legal 
means to do it for themselves. 
3. Protective tariffs against England. From 1783-1801 every branch 
of industry in Ireland flourished. By suppressing the protective 
tariffs which the Irish parliament had established, the Union 
destroyed all industrial life in Ireland. The little bit of linen 
industry is in no way a substitute. The Union of 1801 affected 
Irish industry exactly as did the measures for the suppression of 
the Irish wool industry, etc., on the part of the English parliament 
under Anne, George II, and others. As soon as the Irish became 
independent, necessity would turn them, like Canada, Australia, 
etc., into protectionists. Before I put forward my views at the 
CENTRAL COUNCIL (next Tuesday, this time fortunately without 
REPORTERS being present),549 I would appreciate it if you would let 
me know your opinion in a few lines.

to be just the man to undertake the French translation, with 
German co-operation. In a translation, I would indicate certain 
changes to be made in several parts and, at the same time, reserve 
the right to carry out the final revision  myself. 539 
What should be done, in the first instance, and as quickly as 
possible, is to bring out passages from the book in the Courrier 
français. I do not see why Hess should need to involve any third 
person for this. He would best do it by  himself.  I also think that 
the topic he had in mind on English factory legislation is the most 
suitable as an introduction. However, even that cannot be treated 
without a few introductory words about the theory of value, as 
Proudhon has sown total confusion in people's minds on that 
subject. They believe that a commodity is sold for its value if it is 
sold for its prix de revient" 1 = price of the means of production 
which have been consumed in it, + wages (or price of the labour 
added to the means of production). They do not see that the 
unpaid labour which is contained in the commodity constitutes just 
as fundamental an element of value as the labour which has been 
paid for, and that this element of value now takes the form of 
profit, etc. They have no idea what wages are. Without an 
understanding of the nature of value, arguments about the 
working day, etc., in short, the factory laws, have no basis. A few 
words of introduction on this subject are thus called for. 
My publisherb  is satisfied with sales in Germany. The liberal and 
vulgar-economist gang is, of course, seeking to harm it as much as 
they can by their tried and tested method of conspiration de silence. 
But this time they will not succeed. 
I am here enclosing 1 COPY of Liebknecht 1 for you. You will see 
from the back page that he is bringing out a little weekly paper of 
his own d in the coming weeks. I am to request contributions from 
you from Paris. (His address: 11 Braustrasse, Mr Miller!1) I have 
given him a dressing-down for the phrase about the 'social 
question' (in the supplement)537 and ditto drew his attention to the 
fact that he should avoid uncritical stand of the South Germans in 
his polemic against Bismarck. What should already have perplexed 
him is the fact that Jakobus Venedey has become his admirer.

MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 65 
IN HANOVER 
London, 30 November 1867 
Dear Kugelmann, 
Ill-health alone is to blame for my not replying sooner. I have 
been laid low again for weeks now. 
Firstly, my best thanks for your efforts. Engels has written to 
Liebknecht (or will be doing so). Liebknecht, incidentally, was 
intending (in conjunction with Götz, and others) to make a de­
mand in the Reichstag for an  ENQUIRY  into the conditions of  the workers. 
He wrote to me about his intention, and at his request I sent him 
a few relevant English Acts of Parliament. 604 The plan came to 
nothing because owing to the procedure there was no time left for 
it. On one point you are better placed to write to Liebknecht 
than either Engels or myself.  And that is that it really is his duty 
to draw attention to my book b at workers' meetings. If he fails to do 
so, the Lassalleans will seize upon the thing and misconstrue it. 
Contzen (lecturer at Leipzig, a pupil and follower of Roscher) 
has requested a copy of the book from me via Liebknecht and 
promised a detailed review of it, from his point of view, in return. 
Meissner thereupon sent him the book. This could be a good 
a Marx's conspiratorial pseudonym - b the first volume of Capital.

start.—  I was pleased about the misprint 'Taucher' in place of 
'Faucher' 1' in your notice. b Faucher is one of those 'travelling 
preachers' of political economy. The fellow has no place among 
the 'scholarly' German economists such as Roscher, Rau, Mohl, 
and others. It is doing him too great an honour even to mention 
him. And I have consequently never allowed him a role as a noun 
but only as a verb. c 
Please be so kind as to tell your good wifed that the chapters on 
the 'Working Day', 'Co-operation, Division of Labour and Machin­
ery' and finally on 'Primitive Accumulation'550 are the most 
immediately readable. You will have to explain any incomprehen­
sible terminology to her. If there are any other doubtful points, I 
shall be glad to help. 
In France (Paris) there are the best prospects that the book will 
be discussed in detail (in the Courrier français, a Proudhonist paper 
unfortunately!) and even translated. 539 
As soon as I am better, I will write more. Meanwhile I hope you 
will write frequently. I always find it has a spurring effect on me.

is hailed as the newly-arising state of freedom in the South, in 
contrast to the North's condition of servitude!  ITS  ALL VERY  WELL  for

[London,] 7 December 1867 
DEAR FRED, 
Yesterday I presented myself at the LOAN SOCIETY for BODILY 
examination. This is more than just a formality, for if I were to 
die before September, the society would not get a  FARTHING  back. I 
was afraid I would have to undress (the fate of an Englishman 
who was there with me). In the first place, I do not like such 
inocular speculation, and second precisely at this moment I still 
have a carbuncle on the left loin not far from the centre of 
propagation, as well as numerous furuncles. Fortunately, the 
fellow was so impressed with my chest that he didn't want to know 
about anything else. I shall get the money on Monday at 12 
o'clock. 
You forgot to put in the letter from Siebel. I am sending you 
back Kugelmann, along with enclosure. Also, a letter he has written 
to me, together with enclosures. The screed from Bürgers 554 to be 
put with the documents. That jackass was rightly reminded by the 
workers in Düsseldorf that 1. in Lassalle's time he stated he 
'wished to take due account of conditions', 2. he had 'lost his 
illusions about the class struggle, and 3. he had found in 
Schulze-Delitzsch the solution to all past and future social 
mysteries. b 
As regards the litde Swabian paper,0  it would be an amusing 
coup if we could hoodwink Vogt's friend, the Swabian Mayer. It 
would be easy to contrive the thing as follows. D'abord 6 to begin by 
saying that whatever one may think of the drift of the book, e it is 
a credit to the 'German spirit', for which reason, too, it was written 
by a Prussian in exile and not in Prussia; Prussia having long 
ceased to be a country where any scholarly initiative, especially in 
the political or historical or social field, is possible or is actually to 
be found, it now being the representative of the Russian and not 
of the German spirit. In respect of the book  itself,  a distinction has 
to be drawn between two things, between positive developments

('solid' would be the second epithet) given by the author, and the 
tendentious conclusions he arrives at. The former are a direct 
addition to the sum of human knowledge, since actual economic 
relations are treated in an entirely new way by a materialistic 
('Mayer' has a liking for this catchword, on account of Vogt) 
method. Example: 1. the development of money, 2. the way in 
which co-operation, division of labour, the machine system and the 
corresponding social combinations and relations develop 'spon­
taneously'. 
Now as regards the tendency of the author, another distinction 
has to be drawn. When he demonstrates that present society, 
economically considered, is pregnant with a new, higher form, he 
is only showing in the social context the same gradual process of 
evolution that Darwin has demonstrated in natural history. The 
liberal doctrine of 'progress' (c'est Mayer tout pur 3) embraces this 
idea, and it is to his credit that he himself shows there is hidden 
progress even where modern economic relations are accompanied 
by frightening direct consequences. At the same time, owing to 
this critical approach of his, the author has, perhaps malgré lui b 
sounded the death-knell to all socialism by the book, i. e. to 
utopianism, for evermore. 
The author's tendency to be subjective, on the other hand— 
which he was perhaps bound and obligated to assume in view of 
his party position and his past—i.e. the manner in which he 
represents to himself or to others the ultimate outcome of the 
present movement, of the present social process, bears absolutely 
no relation to its real development. If space permitted this to be 
more closely examined, it could perhaps be shown that its 
'objective' development refutes his own 'subjective' fancies. 
Whereas Mr Lassalle hurled abuse at the capitalists and flattered 
the backwoods Prussian squirearchy, Mr Marx, on the contrary, 
shows the historical 'necessity' of capitalist production and severely 
criticises the landed aristocrat who does nought but con­
sume. Just how little he shares the ideas of his renegade 
disciple Lassalle on Bismarck's vocation for ushering in an 
economic MILLENNIUM he has not merely shown in his previous 
protests against 'royal Prussian Socialism' c but he openly repeats it 
on pp. 762, 763, where he says that the system prevailing in 
France and Prussia at present will subject the continent of Europe 
to the regime of the Russian knout, if it is not checked in good 
time. 555

That is my view on how to hoodwink the Swabian Mayer (who 
did after all print my preface456), and small though his beastly rag 
is, it is, nevertheless, the popular oracle of all the Federalists in 
Germany and is also read abroad. 
With regard to Liebknecht, it is indeed a disgrace that with the 
numerous petty provincial papers he has at his command, 556 he 
did not spontanément 3 send in short notices to them—it would not 
have required of him any of the study which is so contrary to his 
nature. Mr Schweitzer et Co. understand this better, as you can 
see from the enclosed Social-Demokrat 55^ (Kugelmann sent it me.) 
Yesterday I sent Guido Weiss of the Zukunft (this just between 
ourselves) some juxtaposed texts, b on one side von Hofstetten's 
bowdlerised plagiarisms, on the other the original passages from 
my book. I wrote to him at the same time that this must be 
printed not in my name but as though emanating from the Zukunft 
(or, if that is not feasible, then as though from a Zukunft-reader in 
Berlin). If Weiss takes this (and I think he  will),  then not merely 
will the attention of the Berlin workers have been drawn to the 
book through the quotation of passages which are of direct 
interest to them, but an extremely useful polemic will have been 
initiated, and Schweitzer's plan to ignore the book and exploit its 
contents will have been dished. Marvellous how these fellows think 
they can go on with Lassalle's plan. c What could be more naive 
than the manner in which von Hofstetten and Citizen Geib have 
joined together at the general meeting of the General Association 
of German Workers in savaging the section I wrote on the 
'working day'558?

I enclose a letter (which you will be so kind as to return to me) 
from a German-Russian worker3 (tanner).532  Engels rightly ob­
serves that the autodidactic philosophy—pursued by workers 
themselves—has made great progress in this tanner, when 
compared with the cobbler Jakob Böhme, ditto that none but the 
'German' worker is capable of such cerebral production. 15 
Borkheim asked me yesterday who wrote the article in the 
Zukunft? (he subscribes to the paper). He said it must originate 
from our side as you had sent him a copy. I said I did not know. 
N.B.!  One must not let others see through one's game! 
Heartiest thanks to your good wifed for the trouble she has 
taken in copying the letters. You should not exploit her so for 
'surplus labour'. 
As I told you, if I am not mistaken, Bücher has actually asked 
me himself to become economic correspondent for the 'Königlich 
Preußische Staats-Zeitung.* So you see, if I wished to avail myself of 
such sources, I could do so without the mediation of any third 
party. 559 
I am suffering from the same illness as before. Nothing

which would make the thing 3 times as long—is very nice. 
Bürgers has been put ad acta. 554 By one of the ironies of fate, the 
introduction to the article b  sent him by Kugelmann necessarily cut 
him to the quick as the unsuccessful Reichstag candidate for 
Düsseldorf. I quite innocently mentioned in it the fact that the

would make this book their Bible. With his customary tact, 
Kugelmann sends this to Heinrich. Hinc Mae lacrimaeF I had quite

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 
IN HANOVER 
Manchester, 12 December 1867 
Dear Kugelmann, 
Your zeal truly deserves my gratitude, but it appears greatly to 
overestimate my free time. I received your letter of 30 November 
on 2 December, held counsel with Marx, as there were several 
things in it to be considered, and would already have sent you 
various articles, if on Sunday I had not been visited by a 
toothache-influenza-sore throat with inevitable fever, which pros­
trated me on the sofa. Fortunately, that kind of thing takes an 
acute course with me, and so I am fit for work again today and 
will be setting my nose to the grindstone at once. But you must 
not imagine that one can just toss off a dozen reviews of one and 
the same book3 and not merely say something different in each 
one but also so compose them that one cannot tell they are all by 
one author. One often has to pause for thought.560 
I would advise against writing directly to Miquel. There are 
some things which can be achieved verbally with such people and 
which are scarcely to be risked in writing. He will surely be coming 
over to Hanover sometime. 
The United States of Europe* was stillborn. And with Vogt's 
brother1 and minion as editor—pshaw! 
The Englishman who called on Brandes was our friend Moore 
from here, who spent 7 weeks in Eisenach for German-learning 
purposes; I had no idea he would be passing by, or I should have 
written him a few lines to give to you. He might perhaps have 
called on you anyway, except that he had curiously got it fixed in 
his head that you lived in Hamburg. He will probably undertake 
the English translation of Marx' book. 229 
Concerning Liebknecht's South German outburst, I have written 
to him that nothing is achieved by it.552 He would have done better 
not to publish his speeches,d  in extenso* their effect is lost, the 
nonsense in them obtrudes too much. I also wrote to him about his 
curious theory on the postponement of the social question. 537 You

This latest FENIAN EXPLOIT in Clerkenwell663 is a great folly. The

COMMONS or where, as Laura is to marry at the beginning of April. 
As it is not to be a church wedding, it was originally intended that 
the marriage should take place in Paris. That is, however, 
complicated. I should have to prove my identity there and, in so 
doing, might strike the police as being a little too familiar. On the 
other hand, my wife would like the civil marriage to take place, if 
in London, as far as possible in secret, as she wants no gossip 
among her English acquaintances. Please also ask Jones what the 
position is regarding the consent of Lafargue's parents? Whether 
it must previously be countersigned by the envoy (would that be 
the English one?) in Paris? I know that the formality is not 
necessary in England. It is, however, indispensable for the 
marriage to be valid according to French law as well. So, none of 
the formalities must be neglected in this respect. 
What is the position regarding witnesses in England? 
Nothing from the Zukunft yet. a It is a pity these papers are so 
small in format, especially at a time when their columns are so full 
of parliamentary filibustering.

necessary. You can find out all the details at that office. For England 
nothing else is required, but as regards validity in France, Jones

The position is difficult. To pursue an entirely correct course 
would require a much more critical spirit and dialectical skill than 
our Wilhelm possesses. 552 We can only restrain him from 
committing really grave blunders. In general, hostility to Prussia is 
the pathos to which alone he owes his  VERVE  AND  SINGLENESS  OF PURPOSE. 
He has rightly sensed that the true bourgeoisie forms the core of 
the 'National Liberals',482 which gives him the opportunity to 
bestow on his political antipathy the more elevated sanction of 
economics. Ira facit poetamh  and also gives our Wilhelmchen 
cunning  up TO  A CERTAIN POINT.

you write it in English, a critique of the bookc about one column

Dublin paper as a contribution under his own name. I shall send

IN LONDON

Dear Moor, 
OF COURSE our correspondence with Wilhelmchen a requires cau­
tion. As I have already told you, b his narrow-minded one-sided 
SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE was his good fortune and the secret of his 
effectiveness in the Reichstag. Unfortunately however that will 
only work once, and the publication of his speeches'—to say 
nothing of Kugelmann's letters—shows that it had gone too far. 
Now we have the little paperd to boot, in which his household 
words are recorded in black and white and are then laid at our 
door—then the Customs Union parliament,566  and therewith 
certainly a disgrace for us unless Wilhelmchen is given some 
instruction. With his egregious talent for making blunders, much 
was to be expected there, and may be still. No doubt we can only 
protect him from the most serious blunders, but his Viennese 
address and his friendship with the Federalists," i.e. Grün!! is 
already dreadful enough. I can therefore only put 2 chief 
considerations to him: 1. to regard the events and outcome of 
1866 not simplement negatively, i.e. not as a reactionary, but 
critically (which he will admittedly find difficult), and 2. to attack 
Bismarck's enemies just as much as the man  himself,  as they are 
equally worthless. You observe how beautifully he has already 
compromised himself with Grün et Co.; what a fine triumph that 
would be for Bismarck if we or our people concluded an alliance 
with that rabble! Well, we shall just have to wait and see what 
transpires. 
The Clerkenwell folly563 was obviously the work of a few special 
fanatics; it is the misfortune of all conspiracies that they lead to 
such acts of folly because 'we really must do something, we really 
must get up to something'. Especially in America there has been a 
lot of BLUSTER amongst this explosive and incendiary fraternity, and 
then along come some individual jackasses and instigate this kind 
of nonsense. At the same time, these man-eaters are for the most

Dear  Mrs  Marx, 
I must apologise  for  leaving your letter570 unanswered  for so 
long.  But the  Christmas period  is the  only time  in the  whole year 
when, apart from business,  I am  made  to feel that  I stand with 
one foot  in the  bourgeoisie,  and  here  in Manchester this entails  a 
lot of eating  and  drinking  and  upset stomach,  and the  obligatory 
ill humour  and  waste  of time. This  is now  fairly well over,  and I 
am beginning  to breathe freely again. 
I am  really sorry that  I was  unable  to lay my  hands  on a  larger 
crate  for the  moment,  but I had to  take just what  was  available  in 
the WAREHOUSE—I  shall make  up for  this soon.

Enclosed the latest from Siebel. Do please return the letter, 
together with an earlier one sent to Moor, as soon as possible, I 
have to write to him on the 8th, the post goes only twice a month, 
and it is a great pleasure for the poor devil when-'he sees that 
people think of him. He does what he can honestly, despite his 
illness. The thing from the Barmer Zeitung is by him. 671 Moor 
might let me know what he thinks about the business with the 
Kölnische Zeitung; if he thinks it better that / should write about 
this to Meissner, I can do so, and, at the same time, send him the 
cutting from Barmer. 
The pater peccavi3 from Hoffstetten is very amusing.572  He 
naturally suspects Liebknecht everywhere and nobody else. b In any 
case,  we have now put paid to the attempt of these gentry to stifle, 
and at the same time to exploit, the book.c 
I shall be writing to Wilhelmchen in the next few days. I have 
heard nothing more from Kugelmann as to how things have gone 
with the Swabian articles. d 
Meissner could already put together quite a nice advertisement 
from the articles that have appeared up to now, 568 which would be 
quite in place now that the Christmas season is over. In particular, 
he might include those passages in which the economists are 
challenged to present their defence. 
I hope that Moor has been freed from his carbuncle. But this is 
all no good, he must do something to get rid of the business once 
and for all. The 2nd volume418 can only gain, also with regard to 
the time needed for completion, if the fight against the carbuncles 
is waged with full force for a period. How would it be if he were to 
take arsenic again? 
Best greetings to Moor and the whole family, and a hearty 
Happy New Year from 
Yours

Dear Moor, 
If you do not want to take arsenic, then for goodness sake do 
something else, for things cannot go on like this. Have you 
consulted Allen or another doctor recently? Gumpert was not at 
home when I called the other day, but I shall take the first 
opportunity to speak to him. 
You did not send the Beobachter or the 2 Urquharts either." 
However, today Kugelmann sent me the Beobachter and the 
Württemberg Staats-Anzeiger" (I am sending you the latter and 
when I get it back will send it to Meissner, if you do not send it to 
him direct). It's fine that these two PAPERS have risen to the bait. I 
shall now also prepare Kugelmann something for the Schwäbischer 
Merkur. 560 
Schorlemmer will put together the information for you from the 
latest annual reports. He was not acquainted with the book by 
Fraas. c 
A natural scientist has appeared in Paris who calls him­
self Chmoulevitch (Schmulsohn!). This even beats Ephraim Art­
ful." 
The first instalment of the Austrian official general staff report 
on the war of 66 first proves that Austria's military organisation 
was not fit for a simultaneous war with Prussia and Italy, this is 
followed by the naive passage: Under these circumstances it 
should really have been the task of state foreign policy to 
safeguard the state against such a war.e 
The Prussian 2nd instalment' shows quite clearly that on the 
28th, and even more on the evening of the 29th,g Benedek was in 
a position to attack the scattered columns of the Crown Princeh 
with superior force and with almost absolute certainty to throw him

Dear Moor, 
Herewith returned the Dühring* and the Beobachter}* The 
former is highly amusing. The whole article is embarrassment and 
FUNK. You can see that the worthy vulgar economist is frappé au vif 
and can find nothing to say except that it will only be possible to 
judge the first volume when the 3rd has come out, 418 that 
determination of value by labour time is not undisputed, and that 
there are people who have some modest doubts about the 
determination of the value of labour on the basis of its costs of 
production. You see that for this genusd you are by no means 
learned enough, for you have not confuted the great Macleode  on 
the decisive point. At the same time, there is the fear in every line 
that he may be exposed to a treatment à la Roscher.' The fellow 
was happy when he had finished the thing, but I am sure he 
carried it to the post with a heavy heart. 
Kugelmann and Wilhelmchen g I shall return tomorrow. If there 
is anything in the copied letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Seubert

DEAR FRED, 
I have ditto received the Staats-Anzeiger and the Beobachter* 
from Kugelmann. I am returning you your Staats-Anzeiger today. 
Also the COPY Kugelmann sent me of the letter from the colonel d 
who arranged the whole thing.560  Württemberg is now sufficiently 
provided. In my opinion,—with special regard to sales—Austria is 
now the most important. Notabene, if you have the patience to 
write more prescriptions. 6 Little Jenny, an expert in this respect, 
claims that you are developing great dramatic talent, or comic 
talent, in pursuing this action from 'different' viewpoints and in 
different disguises.

In the next few days—I am still a trifle limp, and do not feel 
much like writing—but as soon as I am quite on my feet I shall 
give Wilhelmchen a a good hiding. This is because of his 
identification of my views with the specific views of Wilhelm. 
Dühring's article b (he is lecturer at Berlin University) is very 
decent, particularly since I handled his master 'Carey' so roughly. 
Dühring obviously misunderstood various things. But the oddest 
thing is that he ranks me with Stein, because I pursue the 
dialectic, and Stein assembles thoughtlessly the greatest trivialities 
in clumsy hair-splitting, with a few Hegelian category conversions^ 
Have you already received Borkheim's Perled? 
It appears that professional poesy is simply a mask for the driest 
sort of prosiness. Take, for example, the Freiligrath family. Kate 
travels (on her honeymoon) to Paris with Kröker, the young corn 
usurer. However, since this noble man has 'business' to do at the 
same time, he leaves her alone in one of the big Paris hotels for 
2-3 days. Kate and the whole FAMILY find this quite in order. Kate 
even writes delightedly that in the hotel they call her 'mademoisel­
le' (after she had spent the night together with Kröker there), and 
that all the waiters and even the porter give her friendly 'nods'. 
But even more: Kröker (after this business trip to the provinces) 
returns from Paris immediately to London with Kate, and the 
whole family is delighted that the 'HONEYMOON' is to be postponed 
for 6 months, since business 'comes first'. After all, for a poet the 
HONEYMOON is only a flower of speech, and can be 'celebrated' before 
or after the accouchement, early or late (the facts were related by 
the Freiligrath boys e in my house). Kate even seems to have read 
Clauren, for she described herself—from Paris—as a 'grass 
widow'. 
The Yankees will show John Bull what's what. What do you 
think of the latest rodomontades of the Russians?

MARX TO ENGELS 574 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 8 January 1868 
DEAR FRED, 
Ad vocem* Dühring.b  It is a great deal from this man that he 
gives almost positive acceptance to the section on 'primitive 
accumulation'. 575 He is still young. As a follower of Carey he is in 
direct opposition to the FREETRADERS. Furthermore, he is a university 
lecturer, and therefore not displeased that Professor Roscher, who 
blocks the way for them all, is receiving some kicks.c  One thing in 
his description struck me very strongly. That is, as long as the 
determination of value by labour time is itself left 'undetermined', 
as it is with Ricardo, it does not make people SHAKY. But as soon as 
it is brought exactly into connection with the working day and its 
variations, a very unpleasant new light dawns upon them. I believe 
one reason that Dühring reviewed the book at all is malice against 
Roscher. Indeed it is easy to scent his anxiety that he might also be 
'Roscher'ed. Curiously, the fellow has not detected the three 
fundamentally new elements of the book: 
1. that in contrast to all previous political economy, which from 
the outset treated the particular fragments of surplus value with 
their fixed forms of rent, profit and interest as already given, I 
begin by dealing with the general form of surplus value, in which 
all these elements are still undifferentiated, in solution as it were; 
2. that the economists, without exception, have missed the 
simple fact that, if the commodity has the double character of use 
value and exchange value, then the labour represented in the 
commodity must also have a double character; thus the bare 
analysis of labour sans phrase,d  as in Smith, Ricardo, etc., is 
bound to come up against the inexplicable everywhere. This is, in 
fact, the whole secret of the critical conception; 
3. that for the first time wages are shown as the irrational 
outward form of a hidden relationship, and this is demonstrated 
exactly in both forms of wages: time wages and piece wages. (It 
was a help to me that similar formulae are often found in higher 
mathematics.) 
a With regard to - b  E. Dühring, 'Marx, Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Oekonomie, 
1. Band, Hamburg 1867'. - c See this volume, p. 511. - d without more ado 

=====第553页=====
315. Marx to Engels. 8 January 1868 515 
As for Mr Dühring's modest objection to the determination of 
value, he will be astonished when he sees in Volume  II 418 how 
little the determination of value counts for 'directly' in 
bourgeois society. Actually, no form of society can prevent the 
labour time at the disposal of society from regulating production 
in ONE  WAY  OR ANOTHER. But so long as this regulation is not effected 
through the direct and conscious control of society over its labour 
time—which is only possible under common ownership—but 
through the movement of commodity prices, then things will 
remain as you so aptly described them already in the Deutsch-
Französische Jahrbücher* 
Ad vocem Vienna. I am sending you various Vienna papers (of 
which you must return to me the Neues Wiener Tagblatt which 
belongs to Borkheim, and keep the rest), from which you will see 
two things: firstly how important Vienna is at this moment as a 
market place, since there is new life there 576; and secondly the way 
the matter should be handled there. I cannot find the address of 
Prof.  Richter. Perhaps you have Liebknecht's letter which gives it. 
If not, ask him to send it to you, and then dispatch the article 
direct to Richter, but not via Liebknecht. 
It seems to me that Wilhelmchen is by no means ALTOGETHER bona 
fide. He (for whom I have had to find so much time to make good 
his asininity in the Allgemeine Augsburger, etc., 577) has so far found 
no time even to mention publicly the title of my bookb  or my name. 
He overlooks the affair in the Zukunft so as not to be put in the 
embarrassing position of sacrificing his own independent great­
ness.  And there was also no time available to say a solitary word in 
the workers' paper (Deutsche Arbeiterhalle, Mannheim), which 
appears under the direct control of his friend Bebel. In short, it is 
certainly no fault of Wilhelmchen that my book has not been 
totally ignored. First, he has not read it (although to little Jenny he 
made fun of Richter, who thinks that he needs to understand a 
book before he can publicise it), and secondly, after he had read it 
or claimed to have read it, he has had no time, although he has 
time,  since I got him Borkheim's SUBVENTION, to write letters 
twice weekly to Borkheim; although, instead of sending the 
shares' 1 to Strohn for the money, which was transmitted to him 
through me and obtained by my good offices, he asks for Strohn's 
address, in order to play his tricks with him directly, behind my back, 
a F. Engels, 'Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy'. - b the first volume of 
Capital in the Allgemeine Zeitung - c K. Marx, 'Plagiarism' (see this volume, 
p. 495). - d  of the Demokratisches Wochenblatt 

=====第554页=====
516 315. Marx to Engels. 8 January 1868 
and swamp him with epistles as he does Borkheim. In short, 
Wilhelmchen wants to make himself important, and in particular 
the public should not be distracted from its interest in 
Wilhelmchen. We must now act half as if we did not notice this, 
but still treat him with caution. As for his call to Austria, you 
cannot believe him until it has happened. 3 And secondly if it 
should come to this, we shall not dissuade him, but  IF NECESSARY, 
simply explain to him what I explained to him when he joined 
Brass's Norddeutsche,*' 5''8 that, if he should compromise himself 
again, he will be, if necessary, publicly disavowed. I told him this, in 
the presence of witnesses, when he moved off to Berlin at that 
time. 
I think you can send articles direct to the enclosed Neue Freie 
Presse (Vienna). The present joint owner, Dr Max Friedländer 
(Lassalle's cousin and deadly enemy), was the person for whom I 
acted as a correspondent for a longish period for the old Vienna 
Presse and for the Oder-Zeitung. c 
Finally, with regard to the Internationale Revue, Fox (who was 
sent to Vienna by an English paper to pay a visit and establish 
connections) asked me, from Vienna a few days ago, for a letter of 
introduction to Arnold Hilberg. I sent it to him, and at the same 
time told the said Hilberg in this letter that circumstances had 
prevented us writing, that we would do something this year, etc.111 
Fortnightly Review. Professor Beesly, one of the triumviri who 
secretly direct this paper, has told his special friend Lafargue 
(whom he constantly invites to dine at his house) that he is morally 
certain (it completely depends upon him!) that a review509 would 
be accepted. Lafargue would hand it in to him  himself. 
Ad vocem Pyat. In today's Times you will see the ADDRESS of the 
FRENCH DEMOCRATS about FENIANISM  257 (which appeared 4 weeks ago) 
and was sent in by Pyat.d  What has happened is this. The French 
government has launched an investigation (particularly visites 
domiciliaires" at the homes of our correspondents in Paris) against 
the International Association as a société illicite. 1 Ditto probably sent 
to the British government letters about FENIANISM written by our 
Dupont. 579 Mr Pyat, who always ran down our 'Association' as 
non-revolutionary, Bonapartist, etc., is afraid of this TURN of things, 
and is swiftly seeking to give the appearance that he has something 
to do with the matter and is 'MOVING'.

have now proven yourself twice a prophet, firstly a tactical 
prophet (in the Sevastopol affair), and secondly a strategic prophet 
(in the Prussian-Austrian affair). 580 But the sense of sensible men

Dear Moor, 
I wanted to write to you at length today, but the intervention of 
a Serb and a Wallachian, who held me up for hours, has 
frustrated my plans. Moreover, yesterday I had a visit from the 
ex-dictator Amand Goegg, who is travelling for the ridiculous 
Peace League461 and who ruined my evening. Luckily, Schorlem-
mer also happened by, and got the surprise of his life with this 
fossil of Federal Republic; he had not believed such a thing 
possible. The stupid oaf has become ten times more stupid 
through the unthinking repetition of the same phrases, and has 
lost all points of contact with the world of common sense (not to 
" Österreichs Kämpfe im Jahre 1866..., Bd. 1 (see this volume, pp. 510-11).

mention actual thinking). Apart from Switzerland and the Canton 
of Baden, there is still nothing else in the world for people of this 
sort. For all that, he soon convinced himself of the truth of your 
first reply to his application for support: that the further apart we 
lived and the less we had to do with one another, the better we 
would get on. He admitted that in the Vogt affair 63 Blind had 
behaved like a  coward,  but said he was after all a worthy fellow, 
and even threatened to reconcile you and Blind! Vogt —no 
politician, but a worthy fellow, honest to the backbone, who simply 
scribbled away in the daytime without considering the content—if 
we 2 spent an hour together then we would be like brothers; he 
admitted him to be a Bonapartist, but not a paid one. To which I 
replied that all Bonapartists were paid, there were no unpaid 
ones,  and if he could show me an unpaid one, then I would accept 
the possibility that Vogt was not paid; otherwise I would not. This 
astonished him, but finally he discovered one— Ludwig Bamberger] 
Incidentally, he said that Vogt had continually had a very hard 
time,  his wife was a peasant girl from the Bernese Oberland, 
whom he had married out of virtue after he had made her a baby. 
Vogt, the artful dodger, appears to have pulled the wool well over 
this jackass's eyes. But when Schorlemmer and I explained to him 
that Vogt had not produced anything as a natural scientist either, 
you should have seen his rage: Had he not popularised? Was not 
that worth while? 
I shall write something for Vienna as soon as it is in any way 
possible. Additionally for the Fortnightly,509 but I would need to 
know first whether it could be made into a longer article, or 
should only be a short notice like those at the back of the 
Fortnightly. Beesly should be sounded out about this3; a short 
notice would be almost useless and Beesly himself would learn 
nothing about the bookb from it. 
I shall call Wilhelmchen c to account in a few days time about 
fulfilling the promises he made me: we shall make this little fellow 
get a move on. I have Richter's address. 
Herewith returned Liebknecht, Kugelmann and Siebel.

MARX TO ENGELS 101 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 11 January 1868 
DEAR FRED, 
The Top'3  was bustling around for a long time in London. He 
also visited Borkheim, where he produced just the same phrases as 
he did to you, only with better success, for he knew how to tickle 
the vanity of our Borkheim. But after he had squeezed out of the 
latter money for 10 shares, ditto assimilated various of his wines, 
he was not seen there again. For the understanding of his further 
activity in London, the following preliminary report. Cremer, as 
you know, was removed a long time since from his post as 
SECRETARY of the INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL, and in his anger at this he 
long ago resigned as MEMBER  OF THE COUNCIL, and was not re-elected 
as such by the last congress either. b Mr Odger was re-elected. On 
my proposal, however, the post of president (the annual one) was 
abolished, and replaced by a CHAIRMAN, to be elected at each 
sitting.489  Odger, annoyed by this, stays away from us on principle. 
WELL!  Mr 'Fop' insinuates himself via Le Lubez to Odger (who 
introduced him to the LONDON TRADES COUNCIL 18) and to Cremer. 
They appointed a London committee,0 Beales as PRESIDENT, etc. In 
short, an affair against the INTERNATIONAL WORKING MENS ASSOCIATION. 
(At the founding MEETING Fop also introduced the noble Blind.) 
The fellows had the impudence to invite me to their 2nd MEETING 
LAST  WEEK. Eccarius (in a very badly written article in the Bee-Hive 
last Saturday) denounced Fop and his consorts.d 
I am writing to you naked and with alcohol compresses. I went 
out again for the first time the day before  yesterday,  to the British 
Museum, of course, because I cannot write yet. Then yesterday 
there was a new outbreak under my left breast. The alcohol 
treatment, which Nélaton used in Paris for even the largest 
carbuncles, is, from my personal experience, by far the speediest and 
pleasantest for the patient (apart from cutting or lancing, 
depending on the case). The misfortune is only the constant 
a Amand Goegg. In German 'Geek' means a 'dandy' or 'fop'. - b Lausanne Congress

activity, necessitated by the rapid evaporation of the alcohol. 
At the museum, where I did nothing but leaf through 
catalogues, I also noted that Dühring is a great philosopher. For 
he has written a Natürliche Dialektik against Hegel's 'un-natural' 
one. Hinc Mae lacrimae." The gentlemen in Germany (with the 
exception of theological reactionaries) believe Hegel's dialectic to 
be a 'dead dog'. 581 Feuerbach has much on his conscience in this 
respect. 
The French government has started a prosecution against the 
Paris Committee of the INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMENS ASSOCIATION (as 
société illicite b). This is very agreeable for me, since it means that 
the jackasses have been hindered and interrupted in their 
discussion of the programme they had already drawn up for the 
congress of 1868. 582 Dupont has apparently written something 
incautious about the Fenians 579 to his Paris correspondents that 
Bonaparte, who is now creeping dolefully up the arse of the 
British government, forwarded to Downing Street.' 
It is characteristic that the disclosures of Prokesch-Osten, Gentz 
and Count Münster 0 are being printed one after the other—with 
the direct or indirect collaboration of the Austrian government. 
Urquhart, with his ignorance now becoming permanent, knows 
only the first one. It is also very indicative of his 'totality', that he 
does not know Moltke's Turkish War of 1828, etc., e which would 
have provided him with excellent material. Incidentally, at the 
time when I was in Berlin (at Lassalle's)583 Moltke was regarded as 
a declared Russophobe, inside the Royal Prussian frontiers, 
naturally. 
If you should be writing to Borkheim some time, request him to 
let you have a look at the two small Russian pamphlets about which I 
had told you. I would particularly like you to look at the one about 
the emancipation of the serfs, so that you can let me know the 
quintessence. 
From the enclosed Courrier français you will see that the French 
government is entering into a direct polemic with General 
Cluseret.

Dear Kugelmann,

and you  yourself.  And then  MY  BEST THANKS  for the Jupiter,585 and 
for the  activity  and  interest  you  display  in making propaganda  and 
leading  the  German press  by the  nose.c  As our  friend Weerth,  who 
unfortunately died  too  early, used  to sing: 
The finest thing  in all the  world 
Is making your enemies bellow, 
And cracking really awful jokes 
About each pompous fellow.d 
With  all  respect  for  your medical authority,  you  have  too low an 
opinion  of the  English, German  and  French doctors whom  I have 
in turn consulted  and  continue  to consult here,  if you  think they 
cannot distinguish anthrax (carbuncles) from  FURUNCLES,  particularly

patient like myself who knows both forms of monster could do so, 
for the subjective impression they make is very different, though 
as far as I know no doctor has yet managed to distinguish exactly 
between the two things  theoretically.  I have only been persecuted by 
this business for a few years. Earlier quite unknown to me. At the

prices).  Orders like this take too long from here. 
Finally, I must ask you to send me ABOUT 12 COPIES of my

pestering me for them.

ENGELS  TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester,  16 January  1868 
Dear Moor, 
I have just discovered that  I have left  all your letters  at home  in 
another coat-pocket (including  the  last letter from your chief 
HONOURABLE  SECRETARY  a for which I express special thanks) and so I 
shall have  to reply from memory. 
You received  the  Courriers français  and  also  the  Wiener Tagbtatt 
yesterday. 
I am  sending  you the  Prussian report,b with special explanations. 
Or rather  it is  only necessary  to  look  at the  sketch contained 
therein  on the  positions  on the  evening  of June 28th  in order  to 
see that Benedek  had  brought together  6 corps  (not  counting 
cavalry)  in an  area  of 2  square miles, faced  by the  Crown Princec 
with only  the 5th  Corps  and 1  brigade  of the 6th  Corps.  If, on the 
29th, Benedek  had  attacked Steinmetz  (5th  Corps),  the  latter 
would have been thrown back across  the  mountains  on to the 6th 
Corps,  and on the  30th Benedek would have been able  to attack 
the Guards  and the 1st  Corps  at his  leisure with  at least  4 corps 
and throw them back, après quoi d the  cautious Frederick Charles 
would have taken great care  not to act  unrestrainedly. Frederick 
Charles  had 5  corps  and  would have been faced  by at  least  6; the 
order  for  them  to retreat  was,  however, certain  as soon  as the 3 
individual columns  of the  Crown Prince  had  been beaten,  and 
thereby  the  campaign would have acquired  a completely different 
character. That  the  Austrians would finally have been beaten,  if 
the Prussians  had  shown some care,  is clear from  a comparison  of 
the figures.  But the  Prussian rabble would have been forced  to 
cast aside their lousy system,  and it  would  not  have been  the 
reorganisation  and  Bismarck  who  triumphed,  but the  people. 
Cluseret  (who, of  course, played  the  Fenian257  in London  as 
well)  is even wilder than  the  Germans with  his  militia plan.  The 
American war11—with militia  on  both sides—proves nothing 
except that  the  militia system demands enormous sacrifices  of

money and men, since the organisation only exists on paper. What 
would have happened to the Yankees if they had been faced, not 
by the Southern militia, but by a standing army of a few 100,000 
men? Before the North could have organised itself this army 
would have been in New York and Boston and would have 
dictated peace with the help of the Democrats, whereupon the 
West could have played at secession. The fellow makes a good 
joke when he suggests that what really counts are good officers 
and the confidence of the men in the officers—two things that 
simply cannot be achieved with the militia system.- What impresses 
people everywhere about the militia system is the great mass of 
men obtained at once, and the relative ease of training them, 
particularly in the face of the enemy. This last point is nothing 
new, old Napoleon was able to lead recruits of three months in 
formation to face the enemy; but this demands good cadres, and 
for this purpose something different from the Swiss-American 
militia system. When the war ended, the Yankees still had very 
imperfect cadres. Following the introduction of the breech-loader, 
the time of the pure militia is really at an end. This does not mean 
that [not] every rational military organisation lies somewhere in 
the middle between the Prussian and the Swiss—but where? This 
depends on the circumstances in each case. Only a society set up 
and educated communistically can come very close to the militia 
system, and even then asymptotically. 
With regard to the Viennese papers, I am in some embarrass­
ment3 ; I do, of course, see the Neue Freie  Presse  from time to time, 
but the whole area is rather too alien for me. What are your ideas 
on the subject, also with regard to the Fortnightly 509? The business 
is worth the trouble of thorough consideration. 
I hope you are sitting again, and have had no further volcanic 
outbreaks. Gumpert laughs at your antipathy to arsenic, says that 
it is just the thing to make you sprightly and is convinced there is 
no better remedy for you. But if you are flatly opposed to it, then 
you should take acids, and that constantly, so once again he 
encloses a prescription for the aqua regia prescribed before, and 
this you really will take. 
Best wishes to your wife and the girls, ditto Lafargue.

Dear Moor, 
From the enclosed scrawl you can see what 
Wilhelmchen has not done. 086 I shall give him a fitting wigging in 
the next few days. A JOLLY IDEA, we should 'utilise' the position he 
has created for himself locally in Saxony, in fact stand up for him 
BODILY. His ragb arrived for me today, I have not yet been able to 
look at it. 
I hope you are finally finished with that obstinate carbuncle. But 
you will at last realise, won't you, that simply letting this matter 
slide can no longer be tolerated, and that at the very least you 
must have daily vigorous exercise in the fresh air, and regular 
'renunciation' of night work (as soon as the first is possible), in 
order that you should become at all capable of work again. Like 
this, the second volume will never eventuate.41"

I really don't know what to do about the Vienna articles. Apart 
from the Neue Freie Presse and Wiener Tagblatt, I do not know by 
name any paper in which Richter has a hand; owing to almost 
complete ignorance of the audience I have no idea where to begin, 
and this is the most important point. Laura writes that to instruct 
people is ALL VERY WELL, but to pick out the right point is the real

difficulty. I am just going through the whole book" once again to 
make this clear to  myself,  and your opinion would be welcome. 
It is also a good presumption on the part of Wilhelmchen to 
suggest that I should explain to him and his readers once and for 
all, on one page of his rag, and from this book, what the 
difference really is between Marx and Lassalle. This presumption 
has suggested to me that it might be a good idea to write a 
popular little pamphlet Marx and Lassalle of about 6 sheets for the 
workers; in this space it could be managed and the positive things 
required for the workers could be developed. It would have to be 
sold dirt cheap, and the Lassalleans would immediately be forced 
to take up a position. But for this, time is needed. 587 
You really cannot ask me to drudge my way through 
Borkheim's Russian pamphletsb —at least not at the moment. I 
have a lot to do in the office and come home late, so that I cannot 
get down to anything before 8 o'clock and, moreover, I have to 
live a life of great regularity, since for some time now I have been 
sleeping badly and as a result am often a wreck in the morning, 
something which has never happened in my life before. Besides, 
there are sometimes unavoidable hindrances, and the absolute 
necessity of having physical exercise so as to get my sleep back to 
normal. Each Russian pamphlet would consume 8-14 days in view 
of my necessity of working myself in again, and the poor quality 
of the dictionaries. Ne vaut pas la paine. c 
About the Fortnightly509 next time. I am still ruminating about 
this point. Monetary matters—important as they may be for 
England—I shall probably only be able to touch upon fleetingly in 
the first article; otherwise this subject would take up the whole 
article. If a second could be placed, then it would still be suitable. 
What do you think?

MARX  TO ENGELS 26 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  25 January  1868 
DEAR FRED, 
I went  out  again yesterday  for the  first time,  and the  scar will  be 
healed  in 1-2  days. Naturally  I am  still weak after this  bad  attack. 
I hope that your indisposition  is only  the  momentary outcome 
of the  week  on the  spree.  In any  case,  you  must  not  neglect your 
health  for my  sake  or for  ANY BODY OR THING ELSE. 
In last week's Saturday Review there  is a  note about  my  book.'1  I 
have  not  seen  it yet, and  also  do not  know  who  wrote  it. Borkheim 
has communicated the  FACT  to me. 
As regards Liebknecht,  one should  no longer butter  him up.  This 
young  man  very much likes  to play  the  'protector',  as he  already 
showed once earlier when  he was in  London. This  is also shown  by 
his latest letter  to you. 586 He  feels very important,  and au cas de 
besoin nous ferons notre petit bonhomme  de chemin sans  lui et  malgré 
lui. b What magnanimity that  he has  reprinted  the  preface, which 
nearly  all the  papers printed months ago! 456 And in  addition  he 
has actually  had 2  COPIES  of my  book sent  to Contzen  and the  editor 
of the  Volks-Zeitungl  To  SHOW HIM THE COLD SHOULDER  is best. Apart 
from this,  I do not  believe that  he has yet  read  15 pages  of the 
book.  He had not  read Herr Vogt  a whole year after  it had 
appeared,  and  that  was not  very heavy reading.  His  motto  is: teach 
but not  learn. 
As far as the  'Lassalleans'  are  concerned,  I only deal with  the 
TRADE UNIONS, COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES,  etc. in  Volume  II.C  I think 
therefore that  I shall  at present only take  the  initiative with regard 
to 'Lassalle'  if a direct occasion should offer  itself. 
Regarding  the way to  deal with  the  Viennese,  I shall write  to 
you shortly, when  my  head  is ALL RIGHT again. 
Please return  the  enclosed letters from Kugelmann  and Kert-
bény.  I have  not yet  replied. Coppel  the  Great hasn't turned  up

that I have been lying quite fallow for 8 weeks, with the exception

Kertbény is a German-Hungarian, whose real name, entre nous* 
is Benkert. The German-Hungarians love to Magyarise their 
names. I don't know him personally. As he had a row with Vogt 
ABOUT  I860, I approached him for some information but received 
nothing of any use. (My Hungarian material comes partly from 
Szemere, partly from my personal experiences in London.) Later-
he turned to me in connection with a row he was having with 
Kossuth. Much as I have enquired around, I have learned nothing 
politically suspicious about him. He appears to be a scribbling 
BUSYBODY.  His heresies quant a h Bonaparte may be found amongst 
many otherwise honest eastern barbarians. In any case,  WATCH  HIM. 
And I would consider it more diplomatic not to display any 
mistrust of him (for which reason I am enclosing, through you, 
the biographical note which he requested). 'Meanwhile,' as soon as 
the writing position no longer troubles me, I shall 'order' 
information about him elsewhere. 
You guessed rightly about 'Plagiarism'. I intentionally wrote 
rudely and clumsily in order to make Hofstetten suspect Lieb­
knecht, and to conceal the source." 72 This entre nous. 
You probably know that Engels and Siebel have also had 
newspaper articles published about my book in the Barmer 
Zeitung, c Elberfelder Zeitung? Frankfurter Börsenzeitung 529 and—to 
the distress of Heinrich Bürgers —in the Düsseldorfer Zeitung." 
Siebel was the man in Barmen to whom I wished to introduce you. 
He is, however, now in Madeira for his health. 
A week ago on Saturday The Saturday Review1—the 'BLOOD AND 
CULTURE'  PAPER—included  a note about my book in a review of 
recent German books. I came out of it relatively well, as you will 
see from the following passage: 
* 'The author's views may be as pernicious as we conceive them to be, but there can 
be no question as to the plausibility of his  logic,  the vigour of his rhetoric, and the 
charm  with which he invests the driest problems of political economy.'*589

[London,] 1 February 1868 Dear FRED, 
I hope that you are not also indisposed, since you have not 
written to me this week, and not returned the letters of 
Kugelmann and Kertbény (I need them to reply). 588 Last Tuesday 
I went out to the Museum' and for a stroll. On Wednesday a new

eruption broke out. It is smaller, and does not prevent me sitting, 
since it is on the upper side of my left thigh. Walking is harmful, 
however, because of the friction and the spreading of the 
inflammation. I believe this monster will die out during this week. 
After the numerous disappointments, I scarcely dare to hope that 
no more follow. The devil take this mucky business. 
Enclosed a letter from Schily. According to him, things look 
rotten in Paris, as does everything connected with Moses. 3 Reclus 
does not seem to me to be the right man either. 539 There can 
naturally be no question of the Poleb in Geneva. As soon as your 
article for the Fortnightly309  is AT HAND, Lafargue will do it into 
French for the Courrier français. 
From the enclosed Viennese cuttings, which Fox sent me from 
Vienna, you can see how Lassalle and Delitzsch c are rampant there. 
At the same time as the rascal Bernhard Becker turned up there as a 
great man. He is now a 'Great-German' d in the Bismarck style. 
If you still have a copy of your article in the Frankfurter 
Borsenzeitung,e send it to me.529

fellow  who  packs wine  for me had an  accident,  and  will be lying 
sick for at  least  14 days,  and so I  have  not  been able  to manage  it 
yet; possibly  I shall pack  it myself tomorrow.  You  will receive very 
good  1863  claret  and 1857  Rhine wine;  I only have  a few  bottles 
of Moselle left,  and  they  are in  Mornington Street, where  I cannot 
have them packed. 
Then  I was  also chasing after  The  Saturday Review  and  have with 
great trouble  got  hold  of the  notice.  If you  have  not  seen  it, I can 
send you a  copy—not much  in it, but  nevertheless  a good sign." 
At the  moment,  in addition  to the  tremendous amount  of work 
connected with  the  annual accounts  and  that resulting from  the 
revival  in business,  I must also rush around like  mad as  chairman 
of the  Schiller Institute,28 since  the  affair  of the  building fund 
must  be decided within  14 days,  and  until then  all the  work falls 
on me myself.  However,  I shall start with  the  piece  for the 
Fortnightly.509 Important  and  interesting  as the  question  of money 
is for  England  as well,  I still think  it appropriate  to allow  it to 
retreat into  the  background this time;  it would distract attention 
from  the  main theme  and  demand  a long explanation  so that  the 
English might understand that  the  subject  is simply money  as such, 
which  he is  accustomed  to think  of only  in its  entanglement with 
credit money,  etc.  What  do you  think? 
Kertbény's idea of having your portrait  in the  Leipzig Illustrirte 
is quite splendid. 588 This sort  of advertisement penetrates right into 
the depths  of the  philistine's heart. Give  him  everything  he needs 
for this.  The  fellow  can be  used  for  other things  too, is  very 
willing,  and has the  need  to intervene busily everywhere  and in 
everything. Vain,  but not  stupid  for a  Hungarian.  His  assessment 
of the  German-Austrians  at that time  was  very correct. 
Card,  the  Pole,  has  sent  me an  insoluble puzzle with  his 
signature. Cwi...chiewicz, neither  my  knowledge  of handwriting 
nor my philology suffices for the solution of it.  OF COURSE,  HE WOULD 
NEVER DO AS A TRANSLATOR,  and  what Schily writes b is very fishy.  If 
Reclus alone wants 3,000-4,000 francs,  and  Moses c who  wants  to 
do the  main work, also  his share,  and you  should  be paid  the  droits 
d'auteur, d where should  the  publisher come from?* 39 And  these 
people should  be left to do the job of  'condensing'  and  Trenching' 
it? Moses,  who  would rather  be capable  of watering down into  20 
volumes  the  chapter about absolute surplus value594 than condens-

ing a page of it by one line? It is really your fault; if you write 
strictly dialectically for German science, then afterwards, when it 
comes to the translations, particularly the French, you fall into evil 
hands. 
The Frankfurter Börsenzeitung* like all the rest I have sent to 
Meissner, from whom I have heard nothing since. 529 I wrote to 
him that he should make up an advertisement from the various 
articles.131 
Liebknecht's ragb  displeases me to the highest degree. Nothing 
but concealed South German federalism. The article on Swiss and 
Prussian military history has been worked up on the basis of Grün 
(K.) in Les Etats-Unis d'Europe, 595 almost every word is wrong. 
Furthermore there is nothing in the rag, and though he is as thick 
as thieves with Hanoverian particularists and South German louts, 
he attacks the Berlin Zukunft people who, the devil take it, are at 
least as good as that rabble. Incidentally I have only received 3 
numbers. 
What little trust the Prussians have in the internal peace in the 
new provinces596  is shown by the new stationing and organisation 
of the army. For instance, 3 Hanoverian infantry and 2 cavalry 
regiments are stationed in Westphalia or rather Wesel, 
while in Hanover there are only 2 Hanoverian infantry and 3 
cavalry regiments but, besides, in Westphalia 4 infantry and 2 
cavalry regiments. It is true that in Schleswig-Holstein home 
regiments are stationed with one exception, but 2 infantry and 2 
cavalry regiments from the old provinces as well. In Hesse there 
are indeed nominally 3 Hessian regiments of infantry, but of these 
the 82nd (2nd Hessian) consists of Westphalians! And the 
Nassauers have been sent to Hesse, the Hessians to Nassau, and 
parts of both with old Prussian regiments sent to Mainz. Finally 
Frankfurt is kept in order by Pomeranian infantry and Rhineland 
cavalry. 
The great Borchardt seems to be approaching the target of his 
career. You know that for years he has transferred his priestly 
leanings from the beautiful Mrs Steinthal to the even more 
beautiful Mrs Schwabe, and that every year he has taken her to 
Germany to a spa because of her weakened health, and brought 
her back again, while her husband has to stay at home out of 
respect for his wife's health. So, Borchardt even took her, as 
Schwabe told Knowles and me one day, 'to Königsberg for the 
coronation'—whereupon I naturally asked: 'Whose coronation?'

325. Marx to Engels. 4 February 1868 535 
Although I made fun of the cuckolded jackass for a whole half 
hour over the coronation, and fat Knowles was laughing aloud, 
the oaf noticed nothing. But now, after the priestly doctor had 
kept the husband apart from his sick wife for years, it suddenly 
emerges that the sick wife is pregnant and expects her accouche­
ment about April. Remarkably, the high priest must have been 
guilty of some carelessness or foolishness sufficiently for the 
cuckolded jackass to suddenly see the light; he leaves his house 
here and moves to Berlin, sells his HUNTERS although he will still be 
here for the whole hunting season, resigns his club membership, 
and is so hostile to the high priest that when the latter manages to 
launch a collection for the East Prussians here and sends £700 to 
the Zukunft, the cuckolded jackass throws himself into the arms of 
the Prussian consul and together with him collects abour £350 for 
the official committee. Now there is a lot of talk about this 
amongst the philistines, and although the story above is only 
whispered about in the dark, the position of the high priest has 
been badly shattered, and many people dare to speak of him with 
disrespect. He no longer looks so jovial and elegant. I wonder how 
things will proceed. (Nota bene. The names in this story are be­
tween you and me.) 
Best greetings to the ladies and Lafargue.

DEAR FRED, 
Many thanks for the 'medicine BOTTLES'. 
I still have two not quite withered buds under my left arm and 
on my left thigh. However, they do not bother me when walking. I 
feel GENERALLY better as well.

I quite agree with you that you should not go into the money 
theory for the time being, but only indicate that the matter has 
been treated in a new way.3 
Enclosures from Vienna from Fox (please send them back to 
me).  You see what effect your essay in the Börsenzeitung b is 
having. 529 It is perhaps best to leave Vienna to its own devices. It is 
enough that attention has been drawn there to my book.c  The 
whole business is very immature. When you consider how 
agriculture still predominates in the Empire en gros, then it is 
comical to watch these somersaults. What prevails in Vienna is 
finance, and not large industry. However, as a ferment the 
hubbub cannot hurt. 
Kugelmann has sent me Dühring's Verkleinerer Carey's. I was 
right that he only noticed me in order to annoy the others. d What 
is very conspicuous is the very coarse way in which this affected 
Berliner handles Mill, Roscher, etc., while he treats me with timid 
care.  According to him, apart from Carey, List is the greatest 
genius of the 19th century. In another pamphlet Kapital und 
Arbeit which I saw today at the Museum,* he 'abuses' Lassalle. I 
shall send you his book to look at one of these days. 
Perhaps there will be no war this year. The fellows are all 
anxious about domestic conditions. However, the Russians will not 
neglect to provide causes of friction. They will lie fallow if they do 
not manage to bring Germany and France to blows. 
Coppel was here on Sunday and will come again on Wednes­
day. He is here to put the financial affairs of the King of 
Hanoverf  in order. He is a merry fellow. Kugelmann has forced 
this cousin of the Rothschilds to study my book. 
There is little new for me in Schorlemmer's letterg. But still  MY 
THANKS. 
Salut. Your

Memorandum from Engels to Mr Moor 597 
I have received your letter and that from your HONOURABLE 
SECRETARY 3 and return enclosed the Viennese cuttings and Meyer's 
letter. What a frightful tragedy at the Weydemeyers.598  I am of the 
opinion that an article should be contributed to the Debatte (via 
Richter), and that one should strike while the iron is hot. 599 It will 
be sent this week. The 'specialist criticism' in the Frankfurter 
Börsenzeitun^ is extremely amusing. 529 It is significant that these 
Viennese literary gents, all Jews as cunning as foxes, who well 
know all the tricks, should regard the German press outside 
Austria as bona fide. 
Dühring amuses me very much. The thrusts at Roscher, Mill, 
etc., were a godsend for him—but what a difference there is 
between the embarrassed tone of the criticism 0 and the saucy 
nature of the pamphlet.0 
I do not believe either there will be war, if only because the 
Peace League461 describes it as unavoidable; in any case, Sadowa348 
has made it impossible for Bonaparte to start a war against 
Germany without great alliances. And since at the best he could 
only get Austria (England, as always, or more than ever, would not 
count militarily), and would have Prussia and Russia against him, 
the whole business is fishy. Italy is no good either, and 
furthermore he mucked things up for himself there. HE  IS FLOORED. 
Even the great Karl Schurz, ex-student General Fart, e has confided 
this to Bismarck secretly.fi0° 
It is nearly 7 o'clock, and I have not had dinner yet. I must go 
home first, so enough for today.

Borkheim gave me a letter to him from Liebknecht, which I had 
to send back to him by return. From this the following excerpt: 
'Tell Marx that Dr Contzen is working on a long review, and in 
a lecture has already mentioned the work" in the most laudatory 
terms from the purely scientific standpoint. And tell Marx, too, that 
he should get Engels to supply an article about Capital for our 
paper b which now circulates 1,300 copies equally-spread through­
out Germany. I myself have no time at present for such a job.' 
If you think it worth the trouble to supply something for the 
paper, it would be good to make the article longer this time (with 
extracts), even if it had to run through several numbers.602 
Borkheim will probably be sending you a reprint—if you do not 
have the paper—of the 'Russian refugees' which he wrote for it. c

DEAR FRED, 
BEST  THANKS FOR THE .£10. 
The copies of Social-Demokrat promised by Meissner have not 
arrived. This shows that he is not at all precise. Thus for instance 
the copies for Paris have not been dispatched either. There the 
worthy Moses" has prevaricated for so long 603 that the Courrier 
français has now finally announced that as the result of the many 
amendes,*"  etc., it will soon completely quit the stage. 
I have not seen Eichhoff's lucubrations and anyway not the 
Zukunft for a very long time. 604 Since Eichhoff's brother' is a 
bookseller and specialises in political economy (he is the publisher 
of several opera of Dr Dühring), this is reason enough for 
Eichhoff to deliver lectures on the same subject. 
My head is in a sorry state. But that should 'disappear'  BY AND  BY, 
as soon as the last traces of carbuncledom have gone. 
I wrote to Holland111  again yesterday since the matter is 
becoming brûlante. d Old Lafargue e has dealt with the necessary 
marriage BANNS, etc., in Bordeaux, and has sent all the papers here. 
He now expects that the wedding will take place here at the 
beginning of next month, and that the pair will go to Paris, to 
which he will later move. We, however, have not yet risked taking 
the necessary steps here for the BANNS, since my wife has not yet 
been able to acquire even the most essential things for Laura. For 
worthy Freiligrath all this went very smoothly, but then he is 
'noble'. 
As soon as this affair is SETTLED, it will be a great relief for the 
entire household, since Lafargue is as good as living with us, 
which perceptibly increases EXPENSES. 
As far as the 'reviews' are concerned, I think that after you have 
supplied Liebknecht 602 you should abandon the German ones and 
only pursue the English. First, the echo of an English review in 
Germany is more powerful than vice versa, and secondly this is, 
after all, the only country where finally money can be made from 
the business.

London, 6 March 1868 
Dear Friend, 
As soon as Coppel vanished, my condition got worse again. 
Scarcely, I think, because of his departure. Post not propter." (After 
all he is, in his way, quite a nice man. But that particular way is, in 
my present state, too healthy for me to harmonise with it very 
well.) This is therefore the reason for my silence, so that I did not 
even inform you of the receipt of Thünen." There is something 
touching about the latter. A Mecklenburg squire (moreover, one 
with German distinction of thought), who treats his estate of 
Tellow as the land and Mecklenburg- Schwerin as the town, and who, 
proceeding from these premises, constructs for himself the 
Ricardian theory of ground rent, with the help of observation, 
differential calculus, practical accountancy, etc. This is estimable 
and at the same time ridiculous. 
The curiously embarrassed tone used by Mr Dühring in his 
review 6 is now clear to me. Usually, you see, he is a very 
a H. D. Macleod, The Theory and Practice of Banking. - b K. Marx, A Contribution to the 
Critique of Political Economy. - c After, not because. - d  J. H. Thünen, Der  isolirte  Staat

bumptious, insolent lad, who sets himself up as a revolutionary in 
political economy. He has done two things. Firstly (basing himself 
upon Carey) he published a Kritische Grundlegung der 
Nationalökonomie (ABOUT 500 PAGES), and a new Natürliche Dialektik 
(against Hegelian dialectic). My book has buried him in both 
respects. He reviewed it out of hatred for Roscher, etc. Incidentally 
he practises deception, half intentionally and half from lack of 
insight. He knows full well that my method of exposition is not 
Hegelian, since I am a materialist, and Hegel an idealist. Hegel's 
dialectic is the basic form of all dialectic, but only after being 
stripped of its mystical form, and it is precisely this which 
distinguishes my method. Quant o a Ricardo, Mr Diihring has been 
vexed precisely because in my treatment the weak points do not 
exist which Carey, and 100 others before him, held up as proof 
against Ricardo. Consequently, he attempts, with mauvaise foi, b to 
burden me with Ricardo's narrow-mindedness. BUT NEVER MIND. I 
must be grateful to the man, since he is the first expert who has 
said anything at all.

subjects analysed, competition only in so far as called for in the 
treatment of other themes. 
During my indisposition (which I hope will soon cease al­
together) I have not been able to write, but have gobbled up 
enormous masses of 'material', statistical and otherwise; this alone 
would have made SICK those whose stomachs are not accustomed to 
this type of fodder and the rapid digestion of the same. 
My circumstances are very harassing, since I was unable to do 
any additional work which would bring in money, but must always 
maintain a certain appearance for the children's sake. If I didn't 
have to produce these 2 damned volumes (and look for an English 
publisher besides), which can be done only in London, I would 
move to Geneva where I could live very well with the means at my 
disposal. My daughter No. IIe is getting married at the end of this 
month.601 
Greetings to Fränzchen.

Dear Moor, 
Do not forget to return to me the things from Meissner, 11 
otherwise I cannot reply to him. 
If the Dutchb do not write to you soon, I shall see what I can 
do. I suppose something can still be managed. 
The storm in commerce is beginning to die down, so I can work 
again in the evening. What you say about the Fortnightly is quite 
right; what is published there can be used again afterwards in 
Germany. The matter should be undertaken as quickly as 
possible.509 But you will understand it is not possible to do much in 
the evening when you only get your midday meal at 7.30 or 8 in 
the evening. 
Eichhöffchen enclosed.—You will see that besides his brother 17 
he also has other 'grounds' to lecture on political economy.604 
So, the Russians have again postponed the business in Turkey.605 
As long as they have no railways, I really cannot believe that they 
seriously intend any serious action. Moreover, they have an awful 
famine in the interior. 
The costs of the Bismarckian gloire, etc., are beginning to tell. 
1864—population of Prussia 19,250,000. 1867—19,668,000 for 
the old Provinces. According to the rate hitherto—250,000 per 
year, it should have been 20 million. The rate has thus been 
reduced to one  half.  In the administrative districts of Münster, 
Minden, and Koblenz (inter alia) the population has actually 
declined. Biggest increase in Berlin and Düsseldorf administrative 
district.

Dear Moor, 
For Meissner I still lack the letter from von Eynern. I wanted to 
prepare an advertisement" today but was disturbed. 
Enclosed from Vienna.606  Have written to Wilhelmchen b for 
information. I think I shall accept in general, but say that the 
matter must remain secret 'in order not to disturb my other 
connections in the Viennese press'. 
I also sent Wilhelm two articles about your book, completely 
popular for workers (so that even Wilhelm will understand them). 1 
At the same time, I have coached him in his role in order to 
work over in the Reichstag the new code for crafts and 
manufactures (which also includes factory legislation).607 This 
opportunity is very good in order to ADVERTISE the book, and I am 
convinced that this will also have a considerable effect, since even 
the official economists have to draw on it. 
Since yesterday I have been fit for work again—on the one 
hand, I get back earlier in the evening, and, on the other, I have 
discovered that for 14 days I had been drinking beer poisoned 
probably with cocculus indicus,d which totally narcotised me in the 
evening. I  CHANGED  THE  TAP  YESTERDAY—by chance—noted the differ­
ence,  and discovered the cause, which I had ascribed to digestive 
troubles.

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 14 March 3 1868 
DEAR  FRED, 
Since the beginning of the week I have had carbuncles on my 
right thigh (not yet QUITE EXTINCT). Despite this—and the conse­
quent difficult gait—I went to the Museum, b since this continuous 
being cooped up and lying down at home (the business has now 
lasted, with some intervals  OF  COURSE,  over 4 months) would drive 
me mad. For all that, I am convinced that the present blossoms 
are only the last aftereffects. At the  Museum—BY  THE  BY—I 
studied, amongst other things, the latest writings about the 
Constitution of the German Mark, Villages, etc., by  OLD  Maurerc  (the 
old Bavarian Privy Councillor, who already played a role as one of 
the regents of Greece, and was among the first to denounce the 
Russians, long before Urquhart). He demonstrates at length that 
private property in land only arose later, etc. The idiotic 
Westphalian squirearchical opinion (Möser, d etc.) that the Germans 
settled each by  himself,  and only afterwards established villages, 
districts, etc., is completely refuted. It is interesting just now that 
the Russian manner of re-distributing land at certain intervals (in 
Germany originally annually) should have persisted in some parts 
of Germany up to the 18th century and even the 19th. The view I 
put forward that the Asiatic or Indian property forms everywhere 
mark the beginning in Europe receives new proof here 609 
(although Maurer knows nothing of it). But for the Russians there 
disappears the last trace OF ORIGINALITY, even in THIS LINE. What 
remains to them is that they still maintain forms long abandoned 
by their neighbours. OLD Maurer's books (from 1854 and 1856, 
etc.) are written with real German erudition, but, at the same time, 
in the more homely and readable manner which sets the southern 
Germans apart from the northern Germans (Maurer is from 
Heidelberg, but this applies even more to the Bavarians and

Tyroleans, such as Fallmerayer, Fraas, etc.). Here and there a hat 
is doffed deeply—re, non verbis*—to  OLD Grimm (Rechtsalterthiimer, h 
etc.).  Besides, I looked at the things by Fraas, etc., on agriculture.c 
BY THE  BY, you must send me back the Duhring,d and, at the same 
time,  the page proofs of my book.e  You will have seen from 
Dühring what Carey's great discovery is, namely, that in agricul­
ture humanity proceeds from poorer to increasingly better soil. 
Partly because cultivation descends from the dry hills, etc., to the 
damp lowlands. But in particular because Mr Carey considers the 
most fertile soil marshes and so on, which first have to be converted 
into soil. And finally because the English colonisation in America 
began with that lousy New England which is Carey's model 
country: Massachusetts in particular. 
THANKS for your efforts with the damned book. I cannot find 
Eynern's letter but suffit' to write to Meissner that you sent it to 
me. 8 I have received the same letter from Vienna, with a few 
modifications.fi0fi  I enclose the cuttings about Lassalle sent me by 
Fox. Apart from the arch-blackguard B. Becker, Reusche is in 
Vienna; this vagabond is there for Hatzfeldt money (as our 
J. Ph. Becker writes to Borkheim) —the enclosed Viennese Lassal-
le-creature article is by him—in order to glorify Izzy as the Son of 
God, and the beastly old girl as the Mother of God. 
From Holland11 I have still not heard anything, and the wedding 
should be on April 8th (with difficulty despite Lafargue I have 
postponed the business that far).601 In addition, I have on the 17th 
(next Tuesday) to pay ABOUT £5 for water and gas (also last 
SUMMONS). As for the DUTCH, it appears to me that I shall not squeeze 
anything out of them until I once again pounce upon them 
personally, without previous notice. But  JUST  NOW  there can be no 
question of this. 
Have you read about the scandal (Borkheim informed me of it) 
between Dühring and 'Privy Councillor' Wagener, with the former 
accusing the latter of pinching his manuscript 610 or something or 
other about workers' cooperation.

From Maurer I have noted that the change in opinions about 
the history and development of 'Germanic' property, etc., pro­
ceeds from the Danes who are apparently tremendously active in 
all kinds of archaeology in every corner. But, although they thus 
give the impulse, something is always missing with them SOMEWHERE 
OR ELSE.  They lack the proper critical instinct, and in particular the 
sense of proportion. I was extremely struck by the fact that 
Maurer, though often referring, for instance, to Africa, Mexico, 
etc., knows absolutely nothing about the Celts, and therefore 
ascribes the development of common ownership in France solely 
to the Germanic conquerors. 'As though,' Mr Bruno a would say, 
'as though' we did not possess a Celtic (Welsh) book of laws from 
the 11th centuryb  which is entirely communist, and 'as though' the 
French in recent years had not just excavated original settlements 
in Celtic form here and there. As though! But the matter is quite 
simple. Besides German and ancient Roman relations,  OLD  Maurer 
has only studied oriental (Greek-Turkish!) ones.

It is strange how Dollfus (Alsace) has won such false renommé. 
This HUMBUC, who ranks far beneath such Englishmen as Briggs, 
etc., has drafted his contracts with his workers, contracts that 
could only be entered into by a degenerate rabble, in such a way 
that they do in fact become his colony of serfs, and in fact he 
treats them well 'as serfs', and exploits them as neatly as anybody 
else.  And on this account the brute recently introduced in the 
Corps législatif the nasty paragraph of the Press Law about the 'vie 
privée qui doit être murée'." 611 For here and there light had been 
thrown on his philanthropic juggling. 
The way in which the English in Ireland are now treating 
political prisoners, or just suspects, or those only sentenced to 
ordinary prison terms (like Pigott of The Irishman and Sullivan of 
the News) in fact exceeds anything seen on the Continent612—

IN HANOVER 
London,  17  MARCH  1868 
Dear Friend, 
Your letter' affected me both unpleasandy and pleasandy (you 
see I always move in a dialectical contradiction). 
Unpleasantly, since I know your circumstances, and it would be 
wretched of me to accept such presents at your family's expense. I 
therefore regard these £15 as an advance, which I shall repay when 
I am able. 
Pleasantly, not simply as a mark of your great friendship (and in 
the bustle of the world, friendship is the only personal thing that 
matters), but also because you have helped me over a great 
embarrassment in regard to the coming wedding.601 In the past 4 
months—quite apart from medicine and doctors—I have spent so 
much money on BLUE BOOKS,359  Enquêtes and YANKEE REPORTS, etc., 
ON BANKS that I really had nothing left for my daughter. d 
You can imagine that I have often discussed moving from 
London to Geneva, not only with myself and my family, but also 
with Engels. Here I have to spend £400-500 annually. In Geneva I 
could live on £200. But CONSIDERED  ALL  IN ALL this is impossible for the 
time being. I can only complete my work e in London. And only 
here can I hope finally to derive a decent or at least adequate

monetary profit from this work. This is why it is necessary that I 
stay here for the time being. Apart from the fact that, were I to 
move away from here at this critical period, the whole working-
class movement, which I influence behind the scenes, would fall 
into very bad hands and leave the right track. 
For the time being, therefore, fate binds me to London ALL 
DRAWBACKS NOTWITHSTANDING. Quant àa Coppel, you do him an 
injustice. Had I not been indisposed he would have amused me 
and such a diversion never hurts the family. 
Engels and I have hitherto written nothing for Liebknecht's 
paper. b (Engels has now sent him 2 articles about my book.') 
Eccarius is the regular London correspondent. Borkheim has 
written an article against Herzen et Co. d 
Meyer'se letter gave me great pleasure. However, he has partly 
misunderstood my exposition. Otherwise he would have seen that 
I depict large-scale industry not only as the mother of the 
antagonism, but also as the producer of material and intellectual 
conditions for resolving these antagonisms, though this cannot 
proceed along pleasant lines. 
With regard to the factory act—as a first condition, whereby 
the working class obtains ELBOW-ROOM for development and move­
ment—  I demand it from the  state,  as a forcible law, directed not only 
against the manufacturers, but also against the workers them­
selves. (Page 542, note 52, I indicate the resistance of women 
workers to a limitation of hours.) By the way, should Mr Meyer 
develop the same energy as Owen, he can break this resistance. 
That the individual manufacturer (apart from the extent to which 
he endeavours to influence legislation) can do little in the matter, I 
state ditto p. 243: 'But looking at things as a whole, all this does 
not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual 
capitalist, etc' and ib. note 114.613 Despite all this, the individual 
working person can do something, and this has been abundantly 
shown by such manufacturers as Fielden, Owen, etc. Their main 
effectiveness must naturally be of a public nature. As for the 
Dollfuses in Alsace, they are  HUMBUGS  who have managed, through 
their conditions of contract, to establish a comfortable and at the 
same time for them very profitable serfdom-relationship with their 
workers. They have been duly exposed in the Paris press, and for

and how little the professors have been able to make of it. 
Ï shall try to discover the Anglo-Saxon word, 6 but, since no 
Anglo-Saxon dictionary is available to me here, I shall have to 
make do with other sources, which are very dubious, in view of 
the large and peculiar stock of words in Anglo-Saxon. First of all, 
the correct spelling must be determined. With regard to Wiffa, a 
question: where is it found, so we might know whether it has Low 
German or High German sound shifts. If it is High German you 
should compare Graff's Althochdeutscher  Sprachschatz,  the Bayerisches

DEAR  FRED, 
I thought Laura would notify  you  about  the £40. She  claims,

During  the  whole  of last week  I had  many bleeding shingles;

At the  same time,  I am  sending  you the  Schweitzer, which 
please return  to me  after use.  A few  lines from Meissner,  in which 
he notifies  me of his  stupidity  in informing Schweitzer that  he 
should  not  continue with  his  EXTRACTS  C until  / have stated  my  views. 
Quelle bêtise!' 1 I immediately attempted  to redress things. Whatever 
secondary motives Schweitzer  may  have  (e.g. to  annoy  old 
Hatzfeldt, etc.),  one  thing must  be admitted. Although  he makes  a 
MISTAKE  here  and  there,  he has  studied  the  stuff really hard,  and 
knows where  the  centres  of gravity  lie.  Such  a 'base consciousness' 
is still preferable  to the  'honest consciousness'  of a  Heinzen  or the

interesting book I was reading. There was something like a black 
veil before my eyes. In addition, a frightful headache and chest 
constriction. So I crept home. The air and the light did me good, 
and at home I slept  FOR SOME TIME.  My state is such that I really 
should give up working and thinking entirely for  SOME TIME;  but 
that would be hard for me, even if I had the means to  loaf. 
Ad vocemh  Maurer: his books are extremely significant.' Not only 
the primitive age but also the entire later development of the free 
imperial cities, of the estate owners possessing immunity, of public 
authority, and of the struggle between the free peasantry and 
serfdom, get an entirely new character. 
The history of mankind is like palaeontology. Owing to  A CERTAIN 
JUDICIAL BLINDNESS,  even the best minds fail to see, on principle, what 
lies in front of their noses. Later, when the time has come, we are 
surprised that there are traces everywhere of what we failed to 
see. The first reaction to the French Revolution and the 
Enlightenment bound up with it was naturally to regard every­
thing as mediaeval, romantic, and even people like Grimm are not 
free from this. The second reaction to it is to look beyond the 
Middle Ages into the primitive age of every people—and this 
corresponds to the socialist tendency, though these learned men 
have no idea that they are connected with it. And they are then 
surprised to find what is newest in what is oldest, and even 
EGALITARIANS TO  A DECREE which would have made Proudhon shudder. 
And we are all very much in the clutches of this  JUDICIAL BLINDNESS: 
right in my own neighbourhood, on the Hunsriick? the old 
Germanic system survived until the last few years. I now rem­
ember my father" talking about it to me from a lawyer's point of

Cuvier, have expounded certain faits" in a completely distorted 
way, so philologists of the force h of a Grimm, mistranslated the 
simplest Latin sentences because they were under the influence of 
Moser, etc. (who, I remember, was enchanted that 'freedom' never 
existed among the Germans, but that 'Luft macht eigen" 1). E.g. the 
famous passage in Tacitus: 'arva per annos mutant, et superest 
ager\ d which means: they exchange the fields (arva) (by lot, 
hence also sortes' in all later Leges Barbarorum 6™), and there 
remains over communal land (ager in distinction to arva as ager 
publicus 1), Grimm and others translate: they till every year new 
fields,  and there is still (untilled) land left over!g 
In the same way the passage: 'colunt discreti ac diversi'h  is 
taken to prove that the Germans from the earliest times cultivated 
on individual farms like Westphalian squires. But the very same 
passage continues: 'Vicos locant non in nostrum morem, connex-
is et cohaerentibus aedificiis; suum quisque locum spatio 
circumdat',' and such Germanic primitive villages, in the form 
described, still exist here and there in Denmark. Obviously 
Scandinavia must become as important for German jurisprudence 
and economics as for German mythology. Only by starting from 
there will we be able once again to decipher our past. Incidentally, 
even Grimm, etc., found in Caesar's writings that the Germans 
always settled as kinship groups, and not as individuals: 'gentibus 
cognationibusque, qui uno  coierunf' 
But what would  OLD  Hegel say, were he to learn in the hereafter 
that the general [das Allgemeine] in German and Nordic means 
only the communal land, and that the particular, the special [das 
Sundre, Besondere] means only private property divided off from 
the communal land? Here are the logical categories coming damn 
well out of 'our intercourse' after all. 
Very interesting is the book by Fraas (1847): Klima und 
Pflanzenwelt in der Zeit, eine Geschichte beider, namely as proving 
that climate and flora change in historical times. He is a Darwinist 
before Darwin, and admits even the species developing in historical 
a facts - b importance - c  J. Moser, Patriotische Phantasien, Th. 3, S. 329. 'Luft macht

times.  But he is at the same time agronomist. He claims that with 
cultivation—depending on its degree—the 'moisture' so beloved 
by the peasants gets lost (hence also the plants migrate from south 
to north), and finally steppe formation occurs. The first effect of 
cultivation is useful, but finally devastating through deforestation, 
etc. This man is both a thoroughly learned philologist (he has 
written books in Greek) and a chemist, agronomist, etc. The 
conclusion is that cultivation—when it proceeds in natural growth 
and is not consciously controlled (as a bourgeois he naturally does 
not reach this point)—leaves deserts behind it, Persia, 
Mesopotamia, etc., Greece. So once again an unconscious socialist 
tendency! 
This Fraas is also interesting as a German case-study. First Dr. 
med., then inspector and teacher of chemistry and technology. At 
present head of Bavarian veterinary services, university professor, 
head of state agricultural experiments, etc. In his latest writings 
you see his advanced age, but he is still a dashing fellow. He has 
been around a lot in Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt! His history of 
agriculture is also important. He calls Fourier this 'pious and 
humanist socialist'. 3 On the Albanians, etc. 'every sort of shameless 
lechery and rape'.b 
We must keep a close watch on the recent and very latest in 
agriculture. The physical school is pitted against the chemical.

Dear Moor, 
I am afraid I shall not finish the article for the Fortnightly509 by 
Tuesday. The damned Schiller Institute business28 kept me 
breathless all the week, until I finally got things cleared up 
yesterday. If I had failed—and several stupidities on the part of 
my main adjutant put everything doubtful again—I would have 
been terribly discredited, made ludicrous for the whole of 
Manchester; TO BE DONE' IN BUSINESS, TO GET YOURSELF SOLD' is naturally 
here the worst thing that can happen to you. Now it is a great 
triumph and gives me the opportunity I wanted to withdraw with 
honour from official participation in the affair; anyway now 
enough people will be pushing themselves forward for it. I am 
doubly annoyed because this business has made it impossible for 
me to complete the article; but for this I would have had to rush 
it, and in this case the quality is very important. 
Schorlemmer has made a very fine discovery: the law of the 
boiling points of the hydrocarbons of the series CnH2n+2' i.e. for 
three of the four isomeric series; of the 4th, too few have yet been 
described." 
I shall be arriving at your place on Wednesday evening at 9, 
possibly earlier.61 ' 
Where on earth can the enclosed article come from? And a 
letter of Bismarck's to cheer you up. 
Best greetings.

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, not before 29 November 1864] 
My dear Mr Engels, 
Poor Moor once again has a large and very painful carbuncle. 
So, he has to lie down, and he finds writing very difficult. I hope 
that in a few days we shall be over the first eruption. It is dreadful 
to have that again. You would not credit how splendidly he had 
the bit between his teeth with the actual copying up of the book.3 
There is already a sizeable stack ready for printing. The long 
hours of sitting and writing until far, far into the night, and the 
excitement this entails, are undoubtedly responsible for the 
renewed outbreak of the disease. Karl hopes that the interruption 
will not be long. He even wants to try and write something today. 
Enclosed is a letter from Wilhelmchen b which he is sending you, 
likewise one to Weydemeyer which I would be glad if you would 
see to, since we do not have his address. 1 The price of the cards 
for the 'INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY' is  Is. Id. However, Moor thinks no 
one would try to stop GENTLEMEN giving 5-10s. 
A thousand greetings to you, dear Mr Engels, from us all. 
Yours 
Jenny Marx

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, 30 March 1865] 
Dear Mr Engels, 
Thank you so much for your letter131  and the newspaper 
cutting, which I now return. The worst thing about this dreadful 
business in which 'Wilhelmchen' 3 has once more involved yourself 
and Moor is that I have no idea where Moor is at present. 177 I 
have heard nothing from him and don't know whether he is in 
Germany or Holland. I have taken pot luck in sending all the filth 
from the newspapers after him. It is almost impossible to take up 
the cudgels in the newspapers with a creature like Becker,b  I92 but 
FACTS must be corrected, on account of the credulous Straubin­
gers. 618 The most ridiculous and most vexing part of the affair is 
to have people like Mr Reusche testifying that 'Lassalle also spoke 
of Marx with respect'. Lassalle, who copied everything from my 
husband, even his MISTAKES, who had been his friend and disciple 
for 15 years—he is cited as also having spoken of him with 
respect. And this gracious testimonial is being purveyed by people 
who only became friends of Lassalle in the last 2 years, at a time 
when he was already fully committed to that wrong path, which 
was taking him into Bismarck's camp, 98 into the ministry, like 
friend Bücher, or to the ultimate retraite, to Italy. And, of course, 
Lassalle should be rescued for these 'freedom-fighters' who have 
received their reward in his will! Yet these social riff-raff are after

all only following their great agitator. Like his lord and master, 
incidentally, Mr Reusche is constantly misappropriating things of 
my husband's, forever reproducing every witticism from Herr 
Vogt, just as in that last opus he himself borrowed from Karl the 
'grotesque CI.OWN, who has nothing behind him but his own 
shadow' (a phrase aimed at Karl Blind)." The condescending 
manner in which this triumvirate deigns to allow Moor its 
protection, is the most vexing thing of all. Incidentally, Lassalle's 
respect for the aging Ph. Becker was also of recent date. As far 
back as August 1862 he believed him to be a paid agent, though in 
whose hire I do not know, and refused to have anything to do 
with him. 619 He likewise declared to me in one of his outbursts of 
shouting, when his voice always went OUT OF TUNE, that Mosesb in 
Paris was a completely useless muddlehead with whom he desired 
no truck. I defended that Plonplonist93 as an honest Con-
fusionarius. I live from day to day in the hope that I shall have 
news of Carel; this uncertainty causes me more bother than all the 
other troubles. 
We are all well here and send you our cordial greetings. 
Yours

begun. I think that this new eruption is simply and solely due to 
overwork and long hours without sleep at night. He is very sorry 
not to be able to attend the meetings of the 'International', since 
the very existence of The Workman's Advocate is at stake right now; 
until now it has had the greatest difficulties to contend with and 
fonds are now being offered by philistines and parsons. 230 The 
attempt must now be made to get a hold on the money without 
making any concessions in point of principle to the 'MONEY-LENDERS'.3 
The Reform question, which is of such immediate practical 
concern to the English, is also making great demands on the 
resources, the time and the interest of the workers and is greatly 
distracting them from other matters.15  Karl and I were most taken 
by your Vorbote. Both its language and its serious approach are 
manly indeed! I am enclosing Lessner's letter about it. The agent 
to whom I entrusted the Manifestos' has written to say that he has 
managed to prevent them from falling into the hands of the 
French police and that he can now send them off to Geneva. 622 
However, they cannot be stamped, so I must ask you to write and 
say what outlay they committed you to. The money can then be 
sent you together with that for the subscriptions for the Vorbote. 
With respect to religion, a great movement is currently 
developing in stuffy old England. The top men in science, Huxley 
(Darwin's disciple) at the head, with Tyndall, Sir Charles Lyell, 
Bowring, Carpenter, etc., give very enlightened, truly free-
thinking and bold lectures for the people in St. Martin's Hall (of 
glorious waltzing memory 623), and, what is more, on Sunday 
evenings, exactly at the time when the lambs are usually grazing 
on the Lord's pastures; the hall has been full to bursting and the 
people's enthusiasm so great that, on the first evening, when I 
went there with the girls, 2,000 could not get into the room, which 
was crammed full. The clerics let this dreadful thing happen three 
times.—Yesterday evening the assembly was informed that no 
more lectures could be held until the court case brought by the 
clerics against the 'SUNDAY EVENINGS  FOR  THE PEOPLE' had been decided. 
The gathering emphatically expressed its indignation and more 
than £100 were immediately collected for fighting the case. How 
stupid of the clerics to interfere in such a matter. To the 
annoyance of this band, the evenings even closed with music. 
Choruses from Händel, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelsohn and 
Gounod were sung and received enthusiastically by the English,

that you did not receive his lengthy letter,c as he is at the present

seized, as it should have been returned long ago otherwise. The 
address was, by the way, perfectly correct, and I took the letter to 
the post myself along with many others and the newspapers, all of 
which arrived. With regard to the Manifesto^ being a historical

them. He will be sending the 'International Address"" to you as soon 
as he can.

Dear Sir, 
For 4 weeks now my poor husband has been laid low again with 
his old, very painful and dangerous complaint, and no doubt I 
need scarcely tell you under what great and fearful anxieties we 
have all been suffering during that time. Right at the beginning of 
January he had begun to prepare his whole bookd for printing, 
and he was making wonderfully rapid progress with copying, so 
that the manuscript piled up most impressively. Karl felt in the 
best of 'SPIRITS' and was happy to be so far on at last, when a 
carbuncle suddenly erupted, soon to be followed by 2 others. The 
last one was especially bad and obstinate and furthermore was so 
awkwardly placed that it prevented him from walking or moving 
at all. This morning it has been bleeding more strongly, which has 
brought him some  relief.  Two days ago we began the arsenic cure, 
of which Karl expects a good effect. It is really dreadful for him

to be interrupted again in the completion of his book, and in his 
delirium at night he is forever talking of the various chapters 
which are going round and round in his mind. This morning I 
brought him your letter3 in bed. He was very pleased that you had 
been kind enough to write, and he asked me to thank you at once 
for it on his  behalf.  A further concern is that his presence is sorely 
needed at this moment, both in the debates about the forthcoming 
congress of the International Association 28h and in the discussions 
about the policy and editing of the new workers' paper which is 
appearing weekly here now under the title of Commonwealth and 
represents both the newly formed workers' party,b with all the 
Co-operative Societies, and the International Association.290 His 
anxiety about all this has naturally done much to worsen the 
general state of his health. I hope that by the spring he will be 
sufficiently restored to be able to visit his friends in Germany. He 
had been very much looking forward to doing so. 
Karl sends you his warmest greetings, to which, despite our not 
being acquainted, I add my respects.

pious England all communications halt on Sundays. Since the 
reply may be held up by this delay, I hasten to let you know 
immediately today that the letter has arrived safely; but, at the 
same time, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to 
you for my total silence. Just how indebted I am to you for the 
great sympathy and touching friendship you have shown my 
husband was really brought home to me when the young man 
from the CITY called to enquire on your behalf as to my husband's 
condition. Immediately after my last letter to you, Karl really 
became gravely ill; a fresh CARBUNCLE (not a furuncle) erupted, and 
was indeed so obstinate and so inflammatory that for almost 3 
weeks my poor husband could scarcely move and was entirely 
confined to the sofa. Since we are all only too well aware how 
dangerous this complaint is, if it keeps recurring over a period of 
years,  you can well imagine how melancholy the days and nights 
have been for us. 
On the advice of Doctor Gumpert in Manchester, he decided to 
begin the arsenic cure, as well as to spend a few weeks at the 
seaside after the abscess had healed. He has now been in Margate, 
a coastal resort quite near here, for nearly 2 weeks, and it seems to 
us that his health has been greatly restored there. He will return 
next week to pick up with renewed energy the completion of that 
work of his3 which has so often been interrupted. 
Yesterday he sent me his photogram, and since you would 
perhaps appreciate a sunny picture of the man to whom you have 
shown so much friendship, although you do not know him 
personally, I am enclosing 1 COPY with this note. 
With all my respects, despite our not being acquainted

all your friendship! The £10 which arrived on Saturday will avert 
the harshest storms of Christmastide and enable us to celebrate a 
MERRY CHRISTMAS.  The wine was particularly welcome this year, as 
with the young  FRENCHMAN"  in the house we like to keep up 
APPEARANCES. 
If the publisher in Hamburgb really can print the book1  as fast 
as he says, it is certain to come out by Easter in any case. It is a 
pleasure to see the manuscript lying there copied out and stacked 
up so high. It is an enormous weight off my mind; we have 
enough troubles and worries left without that, especially when the 
girls fall in love and become engaged, and to Frenchmen and 
MEDICAL STUDENTS  to boot! I wish I could see everything couleur de 
rose'' as much as the others do, but the long years with their many 
anxieties have made me nervous, and the future often looks black 
to me when it all looks rosy to a more cheerful spirit. Cela entre 
nous? 
Once more, a thousand thanks for the hock and all its train! 
Yours

My dear Mr Becker, 
I hope you have received my letter. You will doubtless be 
surprised at seeing a second one following so close behind the 
first. My husband would like Bakunin's address, and I am quite 
sure that you will be able to get hold of it easily in Geneva, 
perhaps via Herzen. He would very much like to send him his 
book a and write on other matters. Warmest greetings from us all 
and especially from

place of the 'baby Jesus' in our household. 585 Our Christmas 
festivities this year are again very much overshadowed by the fact 
that my poor husband is once more laid low with his old 
complaint. There have been 2 further eruptions, one of which is 
of some size and in a most painful spot, obliging Karl to lie on one 
side.  I hope we shall soon get the better of this illness, and that in 
the next letter you will no longer be confronted with the 
temporary private secretary. 
Yesterday evening we were all at home together sitting 
downstairs, which in English houses is the kitchen area from which 
all 'CREATURE COMFORTS' make their way up to the higher regions, 
and were busy preparing the CHRISTMAS PUDDING with all due 
thoroughness. We were seeding raisins (a most disagreeable and 
sticky task), chopping up almonds and orange and lemon peel, 
minutely shredding suet, and with eggs and flour kneading 
together the oddest potpourri from the whole mishmash; when all 
at once there was a ring at the door, a carriage was stopped 
outside, mysterious footsteps were going up and down, whispering 
and rustling filled the house; at length a voice sounded from 
above: 'A great statue has arrived.' If it had been 'Fire, fire, the 
house is on fire', the 'FENIANS' have come, we could not have 
dashed upstairs in greater astonishment or confusion, and there it 
stood in all its colossal splendour, in its ideal purity, old Jupiter 
tonans*  himself,  unscathed, undamaged (one small edge of the 
piédestal is slightly chipped) before our staring, delighted eyes!! 
Meanwhile, the confusion having somewhat abated, we then read 
the accompanying kind words you sent via Borkheim, and after 
pausing in deepest gratitude to you, we at once began debating 
which would be the worthiest niche for the new 'dear god who is 
there in heaven and on Earth'. b We have not yet resolved this 
great question, and we shall make many trials before that proud 
head finds its place of honour. 
My warmest thanks to you also for your great interest and 
indefatigable efforts on behalf of Karl's book.c It would seem that 
the Germans' preferred form of applause is utter and complete 
silence. You have given fresh heart to all the moaners. 
Dear Mr Kugelmann, you can believe me when I tell you there 
can be few books that have been written in more difficult 
circumstances, and I am sure I could write a secret history of it 
which would tell of many, extremely many unspoken troubles and 
anxieties and torments. If the workers had an inkling of the

sacrifices that were necessary for this work, which was written only 
for them and for their sakes to be completed they would perhaps 
show a little more interest. The Lassalleans appear to be the 
quickest to seize the book, so that they may fittingly bowdlerise it. 
However, that will do no harm. 
But to conclude, I have a bone to pick with you. Why do you 
address me so formally, even using the title 'gracious', for me, who 
am such an old campaigner, such a hoary head in the movement, 
such an honest fellow-traveller and fellow-tramp? I would so much 
have liked to visit you and your dear wife and Fränzchen a this 
summer, of whom my husband cannot stop saying so many nice 
and good things, I would so much have liked to see Germany 
again after 11 years. 624 I have often been unwell in the past year, 
and I am sorry to say that of late I have lost much of my 'faith', 
my courage in facing up to life. I often found it hard to keep my 
spirits up. However, since my girls were embarking on a long 
journey—they had been invited to stay with Lafargue's parentsb 
in Bordeaux—it was impossible for me to undertake my own 
excursion at the same time, and it is therefore now my fondest 
hope for next year. 
Karl sends his warmest greetings to your wife and to  yourself,  to 
which the girls sincerely add their own, and I extend my hand to 
you and your dear wife from afar. 
Yours 
Jenny Marx

JENNY MARX TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 
IN GENEVA 
[London, after 10 January 1868] 
1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park 
My dear Mr Becker, 
Don't be cross with me for not replying sooner to your kind last 
letter. Unfortunately, the reason for my silence was not a happy 
one. For my poor husband has once again been laid up and 
fettered hand and foot by his old, serious and painful complaint, 
which is becoming dangerous through its constant recurrence. 
Nothing depresses him more than to be constantly condemned to 
idleness once again, particularly now when there is so much to be 
done, the 2nd part" is demanded and, to put it shortly, when the 
world begins once again to burn and blaze, though for the time 
being with 'Greek fire', and not with the 'Red Cock'.b The idlers 
and loafers have cash in their pockets and health in their blood, 
and the people who belong to the new world, who have devoted 
their bodies and souls to it, are sick—poor and thus well and 
trully locked in HANDCUFFS. 'SHAME, SHAME' as the English shout at 
their meetings. You will not believe how often my husband thinks 
of you, with sincere honour and admiration. He regards your little 
paperc  as quite definitely the best and most effective, and every 
time we receive news of our native kindergarten, or rather 
Gartenlaube? he exclaims: 'If only the Germans had more men like 
old Becker!!' As temporary secretary, I have just written to Schily 
and sent him the letter of the man who has offered to make the 
translation. h2n You see, Moses Hess has also offered himself as 
translator through Schily and wanted to launch some preliminary 
ballons d'essais* in the Courrier français. 539 But we have long heard 
and seen nothing of the two gentlemen, but, to judge by the letter 
I just mentioned, the matter will be a success. Because of his 
education in philosophy, and his orientation in the arts of 
dialectical leaps and balances, Hess would be preferable to many 
other translators who would be simply literal, but, on the other 
hand, our mystical Rabbi Rabbuni is often not quite reliable (not

quite kosher), and often careless, so it would be wrong to reject 
other offers because of him. Schily will now act as chargé d'affaires, 
and see which is the right man. 
Your last article on the Peace dawdlers461 was excellent,3 and, by 
God (the Good Lord always springs nolens volensb to the lips and 
the pen, although he has long left the place of honour in our 
hearts),  was the best that we have seen hitherto. 
'Goegg' is still roaming around here on his propaganda 
merry-go-round. And Borkheim could have been smarter than to 
give him 100 fr. travelling expenses. If the coins are itching and 
burning a hole in his pocket like that, he should let them fall and 
burn elsewhere. I think there are better things to do than 
supporting these apostles. Amand  ' was dealt with quite differently 
by Engels in Manchester. For your amusement, here is a passage 
about it from Engels' letter. d 
'Moreover, yesterday I had a visit from the ex-dictator Goegg, 
who is travelling for the ridiculous Peace League and who ruined 
my evening. Luckily, Schorlemmer' (a very important chemist, one 
of 'our people') 'also happened by, and got the surprise of his life 
with this fossil of Federal Republic; he had not believed such a 
thing possible. The stupid oaf has become ten times more stupid 
through the unthinking repetition of the same phrases, and has 
lost all points of contact with the world of common sense (not to 
mention actual thinking). Apart from Switzerland and the Canton 
of Baden, there is still nothing else in the world for people of this 
sort. For all that, he soon convinced himself of the truth of my 
first reply to his application for support: that the further apart we 
lived and the less we had to do with one another, the better we 
would get on.— He admitted that in the Vogt affair Blind has 
behaved like a  coward,  but said he was after all a worthy fellow, 
and even threatened to reconcile you and Blind! Vogt —no 
politician, but a decent fellow, honest to the backbone, who simply 
scribbled away in the daytime without considering the content—if 
we 2 spent an hour together then we would be like brothers. He 
admitted him to be a Bonapartist, but not a paid one. To which I 
replied that all Bonapartists were paid, there were no unpaid 
ones,  and if he could show me an unpaid one, then I would accept 
the possibility that Vogt was not paid; otherwise I would not. This 
astonished him, but finally he discovered one— Ludwig Bamberger\ 
Incidentally, he said that Vogt had continually had a very hard

time,  his wife was a peasant girl from the Bernese Oberland, 
whom he had married out of virtue. Vogt, the artful dodger, 
appears to have pulled the wool well over this jackass's eyes. But 
when Schorlemmer and I explained to him that Vogt had not 
produced anything as a natural scientist either, you should have 
seen his rage: Had he not popularised? Was not that worth while?' 
Thus Engels. So Goegg left empty-handed. Now he is trying his 
luck in other towns. Have you seen or heard anything of Bakunin? 
My husband sent his book" to him as an old Hegelian,— not a sign 
near or far. Has he received it? You can't really trust all those 
Russians. If they don't adhere to the 'Väterchen' in Russia, then they 
adhere to, or are kept by, 'Herzens Väterchen', 15 which in the end 
comes to the same thing. Six of one and half a dozen of the 
other. 
Things look good here, the English are running away from 
themselves in panic, and, if somebody hears a cork pop, he 
imagines it is Greek fire, and if John Bull sees an innocent 
phosphorus match he believes it is impregnated with glycerine, 
paraffin, nicotine and God knows what, and starts to run, and 
soon everybody is running, and finally the genuine CONSTABLES are 
running ahead of the false BOBBIES, the so-called SPECIALS, who are 
now keeping order in the streets with their lead batons. Ireland 
has taken the lead in the entire political programme, the English 
are already shouting in favour of Ireland at their MEETINGS, and it 
has almost become respectable to lament the 7-hundred-year 
suffering of sweet Erinc—to weep over it; and all this has been 
accomplished by a phosphorus match and a rope.626 How easy is it

physical means has accomplished more than centuries of moral

Dear Engels, 
As Mohr is once more being victimised by his old enemies, the 
carbuncles, and is, by the arrival of the latest, made to feel very ill 
at ease in a sitting posture, he has asked me to write you these 
lines in his stead. 
As regards the article for The Fortnightly Review,509 I am to tell 
you that there is no question of a mere brief notice like the 
reviews of books generally found at the back of that periodical, 
but of an article of the length of those usually inserted. 
Also I am to beg you to send back, as soon as possible, the 
earlier numbers of the Courrier français.* 
With best regards from all of us and in the hope that the late 
frequent Christmas entertainments you have been 'undergoing' 
may not have interfered with your health, I remain, dear Engels, 
Affectionately yours, 
Laura Marx

NOTES 
1 This letter was published in English for the first time in Karl Marx, On the First 
International. Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new translations 
by Saul K. Padover, New York, 1973.—3, 64, 92, 148, 191, 218, 314 
2 In his letter to Marx of 28 September 1864, Carl Klings, a former member of 
the Communist League (see Note 17), wrote about the situation in the General 
Association of German Workers after the death of its President, Ferdinand 
Lassalle, and about the forthcoming election of a new president. Bernhard 
Becker and Moses Hess were nominated candidates, and Klings asked Marx for 
advice. 
The General Association of German Workers, which was founded at the 
congress of workers' associations in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 and included a 
number of former members of the Communist League, promoted the 
development of the German working-class movement and helped its members 
to overcome the ideological influence of the liberal bourgeoisie. However, 
Lassalle and his followers channelled the Association's activity along reformist 
lines limiting it to the campaign for universal suffrage; their programme 
contained a Utopian demand for the establishment of state-subsidised produc­
ers' co-operatives, which they regarded as the basic means for solving social 
contradictions. The leaders of the Association supported the Prussian govern­
ment in its drive for the unification of Germany 'from above', through dynastic 
wars. 
The sectarian, nationalistic policy of the Lassallean leaders of the General 
Association made it difficult to draw the German proletariat into the 
International Working Men's Association (the First International) (see Note 5). 
By the beginning of the 1870s, however, the progressive-minded German 
workers had split away from Lassalleanism thanks to the consistent efforts of 
Marx, Engels and their associates. At a congress in Gotha in May 1875, the 
General Association of German Workers merged with the German Social-
Democratic Workers' Party (Eisenachers) founded in 1869 and headed by 
August Bebel and Karl Liebknecht. The united party assumed the name of the 
Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.—3, 15, 58, 65, 75, 78, 103, 125, 135, 141,

Workers was made to Marx by Wilhelm Liebknecht in his letters, written at the

beginning of September and early October 1864. Liebknecht also wrote that 
Bernhard Becker and Johann Baptist Schweitzer, its leaders, backed him in this 
request.— 3 
4 At the additional elections to the Corps législatif in March 1864 the Parisian 
workers put up their own candidate, the engraver Henri Tolain, whereas 
previously they voted for moderate bourgeois republicans. In the 'Manifesto of the 
Sixty' printed in February 1864 they explained this move by the need of the 
working class to have its own representatives in legislative bodies. 
The Corps législatif was established, alongside the State Council and the 
Senate, under the Constitution of 4 February 1852, following the Bonaparte 
coup d'état of 1851. The members of the State Council and the Senate were 
appointed by the head of state, while the Corps législatif was an elected body, 
the elections being supervised by state officials and the police, so that a docile 
majority was always ensured. As its powers were confined to endorsing bills 
drawn up by the State Council, the Corps législatif was, in effect, a screen for 
Napoleon Ill's unlimited rule.—4, 15, 47, 274, 318 
5 The inaugural meeting of the International Working Men's Association held in 
London on 28 September 1864 planned to call an international workers' 
congress in Belgium in a year's time to solve questions relating to the Rules and 
leadership of the entire organisation. At its meeting on 1 November 1864, the 
Central Council of the Association, elected on 28 September (known as the 
General Council from 1866), approved the Provisional Rules which made it 
incumbent upon the Council to convene the congress in Belgium. However, 
taking into account the ideological and organisational weakness of the national 
sections of the International, Marx proposed to convene a preliminary 
conference in London in September 1865 to discuss the programme of the 
future congress. The conference took place in London between 25 and 29 
September 1865 (see Note 246).— 4

Marx, selected and translated with explanatory notes and an introduction by

193, 231, 330, 356, 397, 493, 553 
7 On 2 September 1864 Engels wrote to Marx about his intention to travel to 
Schleswig and Holstein annexed to Prussia (Schleswig) and Austria (Holstein) 
after the defeat of Denmark in the war of 1864. Engels left Manchester on 8 
September and after a short stay with Marx in London (presumably on 9 
September) travelled to the Continent. He returned to England in mid-
October—6, 11 
8 Wilhelm Wolff (nicknamed Lupus), a friend and associate of Marx and Engels, 
died on 9 May 1864. In his will he named Marx and his family as principal 
beneficiaries of his small legacy. The legal procedure for receiving this legacy cost 
much trouble and energy, and Engels offered Marx his help.—6, 20, 21, 23, 
29, 115, 116, 126 
9 Engels is referring to the fact that the Bismarck government used the national 
contradictions between the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein and Denmark to 
promote Germany's unification under the aegis of Prussia. On 13 November 
1863 the Danish Parliament adopted a new constitution which proclaimed the 
annexation of Schleswig to Denmark in violation of the London Protocol of 
1852 (the latter stipulated that Denmark and the duchies could be linked only 
by personal union). This served as a pretext for Bismarck to declare war on

Denmark. Austria joined Prussia for she did not want Prussia, her main rival in 
Germany, to enjoy the fruits of victory alone. As a result of the Danish war 
(1 February-16 July 1864), a treaty was concluded in Vienna on 30 October 1864 
which declared Schleswig and Holstein to be co-possessions of Austria and Prussia. 
After the 1866 Austro-Prussian war the two duchies were annexed to Prussia.— 7,

11 The Civil War in America broke out in April 1861. The Southern slaveholders 
rose against the Union and formed the Confederacy of the Southern States. 
The war was caused mainly by the conflict between the two social systems: the 
capitalist system of wage labour established in the North and the slave system 
dominant in the South. The Civil War, which had the nature of a 
bourgeois-democratic revolution, underwent two stages in its development: the 
period of a constitutional war for maintaining the Union and the period of a 
revolutionary war for the abolition of slavery. The decisive role in the defeat of 
the Southern slaveholders and the victory of the North in April 1865 was 
played by the workers, farmers and the Negroes. The causes and the nature of 
war in America were analysed by Marx in the articles published in the Vienna 
newspaper Die Presse (see present edition, Vol. 19). 
The discontinuance of cotton imports from America as a result of the 
blockade of the Southern States by the Northern fleet caused a crisis in the 
cotton industry of several European countries. In England, for two or three 
years beginning in 1862, over 75 per cent of the spinners and weavers in 
Lancashire, Cheshire and other counties were fully or partly unemployed. 
Despite privation and distress, the European proletariat gave all possible 
support to the American fighters against slavery.—10, 38, 61, 199, 269, 523 
12 Engels has in mind the war against the Kingdom of Italy (formed in March 
1861) waged by the counter-revolutionary forces under the former King of 
Naples, Francis II (he was dethroned in 1860 as a result of the liberation of 
Sicily and Southern Italy by Garibaldi). The actions of the Naples reaction­
aries assumed the form of brigandage.— 10, 39 
13 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in the Labour 
Monthly, No. 4, London, 1923.—11 
14 Marx means the death of Ferdinand Lassalle on 31 August 1864 after being 
fatally wounded in a duel with the Romanian nobleman Janko von Racowi-
ja.—12 
15 Lassalle spoke before the Düsseldorf assizes on 27 June 1864. His speech was 
first published in the Düsseldorfer Zeitung Nos. 176-78 for 1864, and appeared 
separately under the title Prozeß gegen den Schriftsteller Herrn Ferdinand Lassalle, 
verhandelt zu Düsseldorf vor der korrektioneilen Appelkammer am 27. Juni 1864, 
Düsseldorf, 1864.—12, 38 
16 The congress (general assembly) of the General Association of German 
Workers met in Düsseldorf on 27 December 1864. It elected Bernhard Becker 
President of the Association.—15 
17 A reference to the Communist League, the first German and international 
communist organisation of the proletariat formed under the leadership of 
Marx and Engels in London early in June 1847, as a result of the 

=====第628页=====

reorganisation of the League of the Just (a secret association of workers and 
artisans that appeared in the 1830s and had communities in Germany, France, 
Switzerland and England). The programme and organisational principles of the 
Communist League were drawn up with the direct participation of Marx and 
Engels. The League's members took an active part in the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution in Germany in 1848-49. Though the defeat of the revolution dealt a 
blow to the League, in 1849-50 it was reorganised and continued its activities. 
In the summer of 1850, disagreements arose in the League between the 
supporters of Marx and Engels and the sectarian Willich-Schapper group which 
tried to impose on the League its adventurist tactics of immediately unleashing 
a revolution without taking into account the actual situation and the practical 
possibilities. The discord resulted in a split within the League. Owing to police 
persecutions and arrests of League members in May 1851, the activities of the 
Communist League as an organisation practically ceased in Germany. On 
17 November 1852, on a motion by Marx, the London District announced the 
dissolution of the League. 
The Communist League played an important historical role as the first 
proletarian party based on the principles of scientific communism, as a school 
of proletarian revolutionaries, and as the historical forerunner of the 
International Working Men's Association.—15 
Marx is referring to the London Trades Council, first elected at a conference of 
trade union delegates held in London in May 1860. It headed the London 
trade unions numbering many thousands of members and was influential 
amongst the British workers. In the first half of the 1860s the Council directed 
the British workers' campaign against intervention in the USA, in defence of 
Poland and Italy, and later for the legal status of the trade unions. The leaders 
of the following large trade unions played a big role in the Council: the 
Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (Robert Applegarth), the 
Shoemakers' Society (George Odger), the Operative Bricklayers' Society (Edwin 
Coulson and George Howell) and the Amalgamated Engineers (William Allan). 
The London Trades Council's representatives took part in establishing the 
International Working Men's Association (the First International) and were 
members of its Central (General) Council. But, while maintaining contacts with 
the International Association and collaborating with it, the London Council, 
influenced by some reformist trade unionists, refused (finally in January 1867) 
to officially affiliate to it as an English section. 
The Trades' Unionists Manhood Suffrage and Vote by Ballot Association was 
founded in September 1864. Odger was its President, Hartwell its Secretary, 
and Trimlett its Treasurer. Subsequently all of them became members of the 
Central (General) Council of the International Working Men's Association.—15, 
154, 329, 519 
On 26 March 1863 the London Trades Council held a meeting at St James's 
Hall to express the British workers' solidarity with the struggle of the North 
American States to abolish slavery. The participants also protested against 
Britain's plans for armed intervention in the US Civil War (see Note 11) on the 
side of the Southern States. The meeting was chaired by the bourgeois radical 
John Bright. 
In early April 1864, Garibaldi visited England with a view to raising funds 
for an expedition to end Austrian domination in Venetia. The English public at 
large gave an enthusiastic welcome to Italy's national hero and official honours 
were therefore heaped on him at the beginning of his visit. However, 
Garibaldi's meeting with Mazzini, who lived in England as a political emigrant,

and his speeches in support of the Polish insurgents angered the British ruling 
circles. 
Garibaldi left England at the end of April.—15, 33, 44, 45, 47 
Marx is referring to the Associazione di Mutuo Progresso founded at the end of 
June 1864 by the Italian workers resident in London. Initially the Society 
numbered about 300 members and was influenced by Mazzini. Garibaldi was 
elected its Honorary President. In January 1865 the Society became affiliated to 
the International Association.—16, 110, 140, 150, 170, 250 
The Sub-Committee or Standing Committee was the executive body of the Central 
(General) Council of the International. It usually assembled once a week and 
drafted many of the decisions which were later adopted by the Council. The 
Sub-Committee evolved from a commission, elected when the International 
Working Men's Association was set up, to draft its programme documents. The 
Sub-Committee included the President of the General Council (until this office 
was abolished in September 1867), its General Secretary and the corresponding 
secretaries for the different countries. Marx took an active part in the work of 
the Standing Committee as Corresponding Secretary for Germany.—16, 54, 
130, 131, 172, 207, 214, 486 
The Statutes submitted by Luigi Wolff at a meeting of the Sub-Committee on 8 
October 1864 were an English translation of TAtto di fratellanza délie Società 
operaie italiane' (Fraternal Bond Between the Italian Workmen's Associations) 
published in // Giornale delle Associazioni Operaie on 31 July 1864 and adopted at 
the eleventh congress of Italian pro-Mazzini working men's associations in 
Naples on 27 October 1864. Attended by delegates from 57 organisations, the 
congress set up an association of Italian workers' societies which joined the 
International Working Men's Association. By submitting to the International 
these Statutes, written from bourgeois-democratic positions, Mazzini and his 
followers sought to take over the leadership of the international working-class 
movement.—16, 44, 47 
A reference to the following passage in the Provisional Rules of the Association: 
'...This International Association and all societies and individuals adhering to it, 
will acknowledge truth, justice, and morality, as the basis of their conduct 
towards each other, and towards all men, without regard to colour, creed, or 
nationality; 
'They hold it the duty of a man to claim the rights of a man and a citizen, 
not only for  himself,  but for every man who does his duty. No rights without 
duties, no duties without rights' (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 15).—18, 47 
In January 1863 an uprising against Tsarist oppression flared up in the 
Kingdom of Poland, the territory annexed to Russia by decision of the Vienna 
Congress of 1815. The uprising of 1863-64 was caused by the Poles' striving for 
national independence and the crisis of feudal relations within the Kingdom. 
The National Central Committee, which headed the uprising, put forward a 
programme of struggle for Poland's independence and a number of democratic 
agrarian demands. However, the inconsistency and indecision of the insurgent 
government, in particular its failure to abolish the privileges of the big 
landowners, drove the majority of the peasants away from the uprising. This 
was one of the main causes of its defeat. 
In addition, serious damage to the uprising was done by the policy of its 
Right-wing leaders. They pinned great hopes on help from the ruling circles of

Bonapartist France and bourgeois-aristocratic England who were pursuing their 
own selfish interests in the Polish question. 
The national liberation uprising was, by and large, crushed by the Tsarist 
government in the autumn of 1863, though some units of the insurgents 
continued the struggle until the end of 1864.—19, 38, 73, 164 
25 In his articles denouncing the diplomacy of the ruling classes Marx made use of 
the documents which the conservative writer David Urquhart, who was in 
opposition to the British government, published in his periodicals The Portfolio 
and The Free Press. While printing his separate articles in The Free  Press,  Marx 
criticised Urquhart and his followers for their anti-democratic views and always 
emphasised the fundamental difference between his position as a proletarian 
revolutionary and that of the Urquhartists.—19

'enemy within' in a political survey published in the Bismarckian Norddeutsche 
Allgemeine Zeitung on 30 September 1864. It became widely current later.

28 The Schiller Institute, founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection 
with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth, strove to be a German emigre 
cultural and social centre. Engels was critical of the Institute, noted 
for its tendency to formalism and pedantry, and he initially kept aloof from it. 
But when certain changes were introduced into its Rules, he became a member 
of its Directorate in 1864. Later, as the President of the Institute, Engels 
devoted much time to it and exercised a considerable influence on its activities. 
In September 1868, while Engels was away from Manchester, the Institute 
invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with the Bonapartists and was slandering 
the proletarian revolutionaries, to deliver a lecture. Engels felt that his political 
reputation would be compromised if he remained President and so he left the 
Directorate. In April 1870 he was again elected a member of the Directorate of 
the Schiller Institute, but did not take an active part in it.— 20, 49, 81, 98, 116, 
127, 235, 498, 503, 533, 555, 560

F. Engels, The Civil War in the United States, International Publishers, New York, 
[1937].—21,  49, 81, 84, 147, 149, 151, 154, 161, 167 
30 Engels is referring to the operations of the Northerners at the final stage of the 
Civil War in America (see Note 11) when, during the general offensive started in 
May 1864, they besieged Richmond (Virginia), the capital of the Southern 
Confederacy and its main stronghold. The Southerners entrenched in Richmond 
resisted until April 1865, when the city was seized by the army of General 
Grant.—21,  39, 61, 82, 113, 121, 147, 153 
31 Engels is referring to the nearly nine-month-long siege of Sevastopol during the 
Crimean war of 1853-56.—21 
32 In April 1863 the British Parliament passed the Public Works Act in view of the 
reduced production and mass unemployment in the cotton districts of England. 
This Act provided the municipal authorities of these districts with funds to pay the

unemployed temporarily used for public works, mainly on laying the 
sewerage system, building roads, etc. The Relief Committees, which guarded 
the interests of the capitalists, were in charge of organising these works and 
paying the workers. The unemployed were forced to agree to hard labour for 
miserable pay. 
The ateliers nationaux (national workshops) were instituted by the French 
Provisional Government immediately after the February revolution of 1848. 
By this means the government sought to discredit Louis Blanc's ideas on 'the 
organisation of labour' in thé eyes of the workers and, at the same time, to 
utilise those employed in the national workshops, organised on military lines, 
against the revolutionary proletariat. Revolutionary ideas, however, continued 
to gain ground in the national workshops. The government took steps to 
reduce the number of workers employed in them, to send a large number off 
to public works in the provinces and finally to liquidate the workshops. This 
precipitated a proletarian uprising in Paris in June 1848. After its suppression, 
the Cavaignac government issued a decree on 3 July, disbanding the national 
workshops.—21,  117

In their letters of 11 November 1864, Schweitzer and Liebknecht invited Marx 
to contribute to Der Social-Demokrat, the prospective newspaper of the General 
Association of German Workers (see Note 2). In the same month, Schweitzer 
sent Marx and Engels the prospectus, which did not contain Lassalle's slogans. 
Since they had no other press organ to influence the workers' movement in 
Germany, they agreed to collaborate with Der Social-Demokrat. They also took 
into account the fact that Wilhelm Liebknecht was an unofficial member of its 
editorial board. Marx's 'Inaugural Address of the Working Men's International 
Association' and 'On Proudhon', and Engels' translation of the old Danish folk 
song 'Herr Tidmann' were printed in the newspaper. However, fully convinced 
that Schweitzer, the editor of the newspaper, was continuing the Lassallean 
policy of flirting with the government and the Junkers and trying to spread the 
cult of Lassalle, Marx and Engels on 23 February 1865 announced their break 
with the newspaper (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 80). Wilhelm Liebknecht 
followed suit and refused to collaborate with the paper.— 22, 102, 136 
Engels' letter to Schweitzer has not been found. 
This letter of Engels to Marx and Marx's reply of 18 November 1864 show 
that Engels wrote to Schweitzer expressing his agreement to contribute to Der 
Social-Demokrat but asked Schweitzer first to let him know who the proposed 
contributors were.—24 
Engels is referring to the Kinkel-inspired campaign in the English press in 
defence of MacDonald, a British captain arrested in Bonn in September 1860 
and brought to trial for disobeying the local authorities; and to the campaign 
by Kinkel, Hermann Juch and others in defence of a German tailor, Franz 
Müller, living in London, who was sentenced to death in the autumn of 1864 
for assassinating an Englishman. Müller confessed his guilt to the priest Cappell 
on the gallows.

In mid-November 1864 the newspapers reported that the body of a man, 
presumably a German, had been found in the Thames, near London. The 
Dutchman Koehl was suspected.—25, 48 
Marx's letter, like one from Engels, to Schweitzer has not been found. Marx 
also wrote about collaboration with Der Social-Demokrat (see Note 34).— 
26 
Marx presumably means the leading article, 'Bescheidenheit—ein Ehrenkleid' 
(Modesty—a Festive Garment), published in the Stuttgart Beobachter (No. 245) 
on 21 October 1864. It ridiculed Karl Blind's address to the American people 
(on the occasion of presidential elections), which was distinguished for his 
excessive claims to political importance and boasting. The article was probably 
written by the paper's editor, Karl Mayer.—27 
This refers to the second congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations 
(set up in June 1863) which met in Leipzig on 23-24 October 1864. The Union 
at this stage was still under the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie 
(Schulze-Delitzsch and other members of the Party of Progress—see Note 99). 
The congress developed into a fierce battle between the followers of 
Schulze-Delitzsch and members of the General Association of German Workers 
(see Note 2), the latter striving to persuade the workers' educational societies 
into adopting the Lassallean political programme (the demand for universal 
suffrage). The young August Bebel was elected, among others, into the Union's 
leading body. Under his influence the organisation began to shake off the 
liberals' tutelage and acquire a proletarian class character. 
Professor Huber, mentioned by Marx, was a conservative champion of 
co-operativism and attended the congress as a guest.—27 
The cotton crisis was caused by the stoppage of cotton deliveries from America 
because of the blockade of the slave-holding Southern States by the Northern 
fleet during the US Civil War of 1861-65 (see Note 11). The cotton famine in 
England occurred shortly before the crisis of overproduction.—  27, 53, 116 
In a letter to Engels of 19 November 1864, Schweitzer, in reply to Engels' 
enquiry, named the proposed contributors to Der Social-Demokrat. They were: 
Moses Hess, Georg Herwegh, Bernhard Becker, Johann Philipp Becker, 
Wilhelm Liebknecht, Friedrich Wilhelm Rüstow and Johann Karl Heinrich 
Wuttke.— 29 
In her letter to Marx of 21 November 1864, Countess von Hatzfeldt wrote that 
a pamphlet in commemoration of Lassalle was being prepared and asked 
Marx's advice about illustrations. The pamphlet Ferdinand Lassalle. Dokumen­
tarische Darstellung seine letzten Lebenstage. Von Augenzeugen und Freunden 
appeared in Berlin in 1865. At first Wilhelm Liebknecht agreed to edit it, but 
when he learned, at the end of 1864, about Lassalle's direct association with 
Bismarck, he refused to take part in the work. 
The Countess also asked Marx to come out in defence of Lassalle against 
the attacks on him by the petty-bourgeois democrat Karl Blind.—29, 44 
Marx's letter to Liebknecht in which Marx enquired about the contributors to 
Der Social-Demokrat has not been found. In his reply of 2 December 1864, 
Liebknecht wrote that Lothar Bucher and Johann Rodbertus had gone over to 
the side of the Prussian government.— 30 
In this article Karl Blind, polemising with the Lassalleans, quoted Lassalle's 
defence speech at the Berlin assizes in March 1864.—30, 57

45 In the pamphlet in honour of Lassalle's memory (see Note 42) Countess von 
Hatzfeldt intended to place, next to a photograph of Lassalle on his death bed, 
portraits of Janko von Racowija and Helene von Dönniges, who were guilty of 
his death, regarding this as a form of revenge on the 'assassins'. In a letter to 
Marx on 21 November 1864 she asked Marx for his opinion of her 
intention.—  30, 31 
46 Marx's telegram has not been  found.—31,  288, 297 
47 Wilhelm  Wolff,  to whom Marx dedicated the first volume of Capital, died in 
Manchester on 9 May 1864. Marx delivered a short oration at his funeral (see 
Marx's letter to Jenny Marx of 13 May 1864, present edition, Vol. 41).—31 
48 In his pamphlet Herr Vogt (a copy of which Marx sent to Lassalle and Sophie 
von Hatzfeldt after its publication), Marx exposed Blind's cowardly attempts to 
deny his authorship of the flysheet Zur Warnung (A Warning) (it was pub­
lished in London in 1859 and reprinted in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung), 
which revealed Vogt's connections with the Bonapartists. Blind's statements 
in the press citing false evidence of Fidelio Hollinger, the owner of a print-
shop where the flysheet had been printed, and of a compositor, Johann Wiehe, 
gave Vogt a pretext to attribute the authorship of the flysheet to Marx and his 
friends.—31 
49 On 15 November 1859 Marx sent Lassalle his reply to Blind's declaration 
regarding Karl Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 40, p. 526), asking him to have 
it published in the Berlin Volks-Zeitung. In his reply of 20 November 1859 Lassalle 
recommended Marx to avoid any controversy with Blind in the press. Marx's 
declaration was published in the supplement to the Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 325, 
21 November 1859 (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp.  8-9).—32 
50 Lassalle was in London in July 1862.—32, 101 
51 Marx presumably means the members of the Deutsche Freiheit und Einheit, an 
association which was founded in London about 1860 and included, besides 
Blind, Eduard Bronner, Karl Heinrich Schaible, Ravenstein (secretary) and 
Wolffsohn (cashier).—32 
52 In view of Garibaldi's forthcoming visit to England, the German refugees in 
London set up a Garibaldi Committee on 6 April 1864. It included Blind, Juch 
(publisher of the Hermann), Trübner, Freiligrath, Kinkel and others. 
Blind met Garibaldi on the Isle of Wight on 9 April. Blind and his 
associates took advantage of the meeting with Italy's national hero to advertise 
themselves in the English press.—33 
53 The Shakespeare Committee was set up to mark the tercentenary of Shakespeare's 
birthday which was celebrated from 23 April to 3 May 1864. German men of 
letters were represented by Freiligrath, who recommended that Karl Blind 
should also be a member of the committee.— 35 
54 In the spring of 1849, during an uprising in defence of the Imperial 
Constitution in Southern and Western Germany, a Provisional Government was 
formed in Baden headed by the petty-bourgeois democrat Lorenz Peter 
Brentano. In face of the impending intervention of Prussian troops in Baden 
and the Palatinate, this government, having in fact sabotaged the actions of the 
revolutionary masses, applied for help to France. Karl Blind was sent to Paris 
with this purpose. The Baden government counted on the support of the party 
of petty-bourgeois democrats headed by Ledru-Rollin, but by that time it had

heen pushed into the background by the bourgeois 'party of Order' and the 
Bonapartists. This predetermined the failure of Blind's mission.— 35 
55 The Low Church—a trend in the Anglican Church which laid special emphasis 
on Christian morality; its following originally consisted predominantly of the 
bourgeoisie and the lower clergy. 
Pietism—a trend in the Lutheran Church that emerged in Germany in the 
seventeenth century. Distinguished by extreme mysticism, it rejected rites and 
attached special importance to personal religious experience.—  36, 426 
56 Blind's address 'Ein Freundeswort an Deutschlands Arbeiter, Bürger und 
Bauer' was published in a number of German newspapers and as a leaflet in 
June 1863. In it, Blind opposed Lassalle's agitation among the workers saying 
that the campaign for universal suffrage did not accord with the 'main 
principles of German democracy'.—36 
57 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, International Publishers, New York, 
1953.—37, 43, 121 
58 Engels' correspondence with Joseph Weydemeyer was interrupted by the Civil 
War in America, in which Weydemeyer fought on the side of the North. In a 
letter written at the end of October 1864, Weydemeyer told Engels about Karl 
Blind's attacks on Lassalle in the American press and sent him a cutting from 
Die Westliche Post with Blind's article 'Ein Republikanischer Protest'. Engels 
forwarded Weydemeyer's letter to Marx who quoted it in his statement 'To the 
Editor of the Stuttgart Beobachter' (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 23).—37, 40 
59 The Carlists—a reactionary clerico-absolutist group in Spain consisting of 
adherents of the pretender to the Spanish throne Don Carlos, the brother of 
Ferdinand VII. Relying on the military and the Catholic clergy, and also 
making use of the support of the backward peasants in some regions of Spain, 
the Carlists launched in 1833 a civil war which in fact turned into a struggle 
between the feudal-Catholic and liberal-bourgeois elements and led to the third 
bourgeois revolution (1834-43).—39 
60 The battle at Pittsburgh-Landing also known as the battle of Shiloh, took place on 
6-7 April 1862 on the Tennessee River, twenty miles north of Corinth. The 
Northern army under General Grant inflicted a heavy blow to the Confederate 
troops commanded by generals Johnston and Beauregard.— 40 
61 Sonderburg (now S0nderborg)—the town and fortress on the Alsen Island, one of 
the strongpoints on the Düppel fortification line captured by Prussian troops 
on 18 April 1864, during the war of Prussia and Austria against Denmark (see 
notes 9 and 27).—40 
62 Der  Beobachter,  No. 268, 17 November 1864 carried an anonymous report from 
Bradford, which was a reply to the criticism of Blind in the newspaper's leading 
article 'Bescheidenheit—ein Ehrenkleid' published on 21 October 1864 (see 
Note 38). The anonymous writer exaggerated Blind's role in the political life of 
the USA. He also attempted to dispute the reference of the leader's author to 
the description of Blind by Marx in his Herr VogJ,and to refute the pamphlet's 
revelations concerning Blind's cowardly attitude towards Vogt's slanderous 
campaign against proletarian revolutionaries (see Note 48). All this prompted 
Marx to write a letter to the editor of Der Beobachter on 28 November 1864 (see 
present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 23-25). At the request of Sophie von Hatzfeldt, a

friend of Ferdinand Lassalle, Marx also came out in this letter against Blind's 
attacks on Lassalle. —41, 42, 44, 51, 107 
(i3 Marx is referring to the affidavits made by two London compositors, Wiehe 
and Vögele, on Blind's authorship of the flysheet Zur Warnung (see Note 48), 
which exposed Karl Vogt as a Bonapartist agent. Blind cravenly denied his 
participation in composing the flysheet, thus making Marx's campaign against 
Vogt's lies more difficult. Marx described Blind's cowardly behaviour both in 
Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 128-31 and 318-20) and the 
statement 'To the Editor of the Stuttgart Beobachter' (Vol.  20).—41,  518 
64 The Beobachter editor confined himself to publishing only the covering letter to 
Marx's statement (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 22) and his own 'comments' on 
this statement. 
Marx foresaw that the Beobachter editor might not publish his statement and 
sent a copy of it to Sophie von Hatzfeldt for publication in other German 
papers. Without notifying Marx, the Countess sent the statement to Karl 
Bruhn, the editor of the Lassallean Nordstern. He published it on 10 December 
1864,  with the following editorial note: 'We have got the article through second 
hand, and only because of this particular circumstance is it accepted for 
publication in the Nordstern: Marx expressed his indignation at this in a letter 
to Sophie von Hatzfeldt on 22 December (see this volume, pp. 56-57).—43, 53,

66 This refers to Marx's plans for the publication of his main work, Capital. At 
that time, Wilhelm Strohn, at Marx's request, conducted talks with the 
Hamburg publishing house of Meissner and Behre. At the end of January 
1865,  a preliminary agreement was reached on publishing the book in two 
volumes. The text of the agreement (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 361) was sent 
to Marx by Meissner in his letter of 21 March 1865.—46, 78

Austrian Empire and a centre of the Italian national liberation movement 
against Austrian rule, of which the Bismarck government made use when 
preparing for a war with Austria for supremacy in Germany.—  47, 54

70 The address 'To Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America' 
(see present edition, Vol. 20) was written by Marx on the occasion of Lincoln's 
re-election to the presidency. The text was approved by the Sub-Committee, 
unanimously confirmed by the Central Council of the International Working 
Men's Association on 29 November 1864 and sent to President Lincoln through 
Adams, the American envoy to London.—49

71 In view of the anniversary of the Polish insurrection of  1830-31,  the Central 
Council of the International resolved, on Peter Fox's proposal, at its meeting of 
29 November 1864 to issue an address to the Polish people on behalf of the 
British members of the Council. The latter delegated the drafting of the 
address to the Sub-Committee, which in its turn instructed Fox accordingly. 
Fox's address, however, reflected the view current among the Right-wing Polish 
émigrés and certain West European bourgeois democrats. It alleged that the 
foreign policy of the French ruling circles favoured the restoration of Poland's 
independence. That was why Marx and other members of the Sub-Committee and 
the Central Council opposed it (see Marx's letter to Engels of 10 December 1864, 
and Note 77).—49, 54 
72 The London Amalgamated Union of Building Workers (George Potter, a 
reformist, was one of its leaders) started a campaign for a nine-hour working 
day in 1859. At the end of July 1859 they called a strike in response to the 
employers' refusal to reduce working hours. At a joint meeting on 27 July the 
employers declared open war on the trade unions. They refused to employ 
their members and on 6 August locked out over 20,000 workers. The strike 
ended in February 1860 with a compromise: the employers agreed to take on 
trade union members, while the workers were compelled to withdraw their 
demand for a nine-hour working day.—50 
73 Heinrich Heine caustically derided Karl Mayer, a poet of the reactionary-
Romantic Swabian school, in his Atta Troll (Chap. 22) and in Deutschland. Ein 
Wintermärchen (Chap. 3).—52 
74 Hermann Becker (nicknamed Red Becker), a former Communist League 
member (in the 1860s he went over to the liberals), wrote to Marx on 
7 December 1864 that the Rheinische Zeitung editors refused to print his 
statement against Karl Blind (see notes 62 and 64) justifying this on the 
grounds of their 'unwillingness' to advertise such an 'insignificant' figure as 
Blind.—52, 53 
75 Marx means the famous 'march to the sea' undertaken by General Sherman's 
troops on 7 May 1864 through Georgia as part of the Union's new strategic 
plan for crushing the Confederacy. Despite heavy losses, the offensive was a 
success: on 2 December Sherman seized Atlanta and on 10 December he 
reached the sea. By cutting the Confederate territory in two, Sherman's march 
ensured the rout of the main Confederate forces in Virginia in the spring of 
1865 and the final victory of the North in the US Civil War.—53, 61, 113, 121 
76 Boustrapa—nickname for Louis Bonaparte, composed of the first syllables of 
the names of the places where he and his supporters staged Bonapartist putches:

77 After a preliminary discussion in the Sub-Committee, on 6 December 1864, of 
the address to the Polish people drawn up by Peter Fox (see Note 71), the 
debate continued at the Central Council meetings on 13 and 20 December 1864 
and 3 January 1865. Marx spoke twice on the subject, on 13 December and 
3 January (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 354 and 356). Drawing on the 
wealth of factual material on Polish-French relations he showed, particularly in 
his speech on 3 January 1865, that the French ruling circles, both under

independence, of which the sole defenders were the representatives of the 
revolutionary proletariat. Marx's arguments made the Central Council adopt a 
decision to introduce the appropriate amendments in Fox's address.—55 
78 At its meeting on 8 November 1864 the Central Council decided on Marx's 
proposal, seconded by Hermann Jung, that any person not being able to attend 
the meetings cannot be a member of this Council (see present edition, Vol. 20, 
p. 353). The decision to abolish honorary membership in the International was 
adopted presumably at that time too.— 55 
79 This refers to Sophie von Hatzfeldt's intention to republish Marx's The 
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. It was to be printed in Switzerland. 
Liebknecht informed Marx of this on 2 December 1864 and asked him to send 
two copies of the book for the purpose. Marx objected because he was 
obviously afraid that the Lassalleans might use his works to propagate Lassalle's 
cult. 
Subsequently, Liebknecht, independently of Hatzfeldt, attempted to come to 
terms with the Swiss publisher, but in vain. The second edition of The 
Eighteenth Brumaire appeared only in 1869, in Germany.—  57, 139, 165 
8(1 Marx seems to be referring to the advertisement about his and Engels' 
contribution to Der Social-Demokral, published in the specimen issue of the 
newspaper (No. 1) on 15 December 1864 (see also notes 34 and 35).—58 
81 The reference is presumably to Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter to Marx of 
20 December 1864. It clearly shows that Marx asked Liebknecht to do his 
utmost to get the General Association of German Workers to join the 
International Working Men's Association. In this way Marx hoped to encourage 
this workers' organisation to abandon its Lassallean reformist programme and 
tactics and take the path of genuinely proletarian, revolutionary struggle.—58 
82 The congress (general assembly) of the General Association of German 
Workers which opened in Düsseldorf on 27 December 1864 did not discuss the 
affiliation of this organisation to the International Working Men's Associa­
tion.—58 
83 The English original of this letter is published here for the first time. The letter 
was first published in a German translation in Marx/Engels, Werke, Bd. 31, 
Berlin, 1965, and in an English retranslation in Karl Marx, On the First 
International. Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new translations 
by Saul K. Padover, New York, 1973.—60 
84 Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester approximately from 7 to 14 January 
1865.—60, 62, 66 
85 At its meeting of 29 December 1864, the Central Council decided to invite the 
bourgeois radicals Beesly, Beales and Harrison to a soirée to be held on 
16 January 1865 to celebrate the founding of the International Working Men's 
Association. This decision was recorded in the Minutes of that meeting. The 
report of the meeting was not published, and Cremer, when sending the report 
of the next meeting, of 3 January 1865, to the newspapers, included the 
above-mentioned decision in it and recorded it for a second time in the 
Minute Book. Moreover, on his own initiative, Cremer inserted in the decision 
Grossmith's name who, as a Central Council member, did not have to be 
specially invited. As is evident from Jung's reply letter to Marx of 11 January, 
Marx's protest against the inclusion of Grossmith's name was read out at the 
Central Council meeting of 10 January; Cremer admitted his mistake, and

Grossmith's name was deleted from the Minutes of the meeting of 3 January.—

86 Engels is probably referring to the operations by the Confederate army under 
General Lee in northern Virginia in the spring and summer of 1863. One of its 
corps was commanded by Longstreet. Successful counter-attacks on the part of 
the Confederates led to their victory at Chancellorsville on 2-4 May 1863. 
Lee's troops began to invade the territory beyond the Potomac and marched to 
Washington. But in the Battle of Gettysburg on 1-3 July, Lee's army sustained 
heavy losses and was compelled to retreat beyond the Potomac. 
General Hood, who succeeded Johnston as commander of the Confederate 
troops, undertook two major counter-attacks on 20 and 22 July 1864 against 
General Sherman's army, concentrated at die time to the north and east of 
Adanta (see Note 75). The attempt to throw back Sherman's troops failed and 
Hood's army retreated, taking cover in Atlanta.—61 
87 Military operations confirmed Engels' prognosis. The city of Charleston (South 
Carolina) on the Atlantic coast of the USA was captured by the Northerners 
on 17 February 1865.—61 
88 The first three issues of Der Social-Demokrat were specimens. On 4 January 
1865,  No. 4 appeared, the first regular issue for the subscribers. When it was 
confiscated by the police, Marx congratulated Schweitzer, the editor, on the 
occasion and emphasised that an open break with Bismarck's ministry was 
necessary (see K. Marx, 'Statement Regarding the Causes of the Breach with 
the Social-Demokrat', present edition, Vol. 20).—63 
89 Bloomer costume or Bloomer—female costume of short skirt and trousers 
introduced in the 1850s by the American dress reformer, Amelia Jenks Bloomer 
(1818-1894). 
Davenport tricks were practised by the Davenport brothers, two American 
circus artists, in the 1860s.—64 
90 Marx is referring to 'Botschaft des Präsidenten', a message by Bernhard 
Becker, President of the General Association of German Workers, to the 
delegates of the general assembly of the Association that opened on 27 
December 1864 in Düsseldorf (see notes 16 and 82). It was published in Der 
Social-Demokrat, No. 3, 30 December 1864 and contained a hint that the 
Association could not establish close ties with the International because that 
would allegedly damage its organisation and did not promise to be of any 
practical value.—65 
91 In his report from Paris, dated 10 January 1865 and published in Der 
Social-Demokrat on 13 January, Moses Hess misrepresented the efforts of the 
Central Council of the International Association to draw French workers into 
its ranks. He alleged that the Council was essentially unscrupulous in selecting 
its representatives in Paris and accused Tolain and certain other French 
members of the International of having ties with the Bonapartists (see Marx's 
letter to Engels of 25 January 1865). Hess repeated this accusation in his report 
from Paris printed in the newspaper on 1 February, following which Marx and 
Engels wrote a statement to Der Social-Demokrat refuting this false accusation (see 
present edition, Vol. 20, p. 36).—65 
92 The letter was published in English for the first time (without the postscripts) 
in Karl Marx, On the First International Arranged and edited, with an 
introduction and new translations by Saul K. Padover, New York, 1973.—65

93 The name Plon-Plonists is derived from Plon-Plon, the nickname of Prince 
Napoleon Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon Ill's cousin, whose residence was the 
Palais Royal while Napoleon III resided in the Tuiliers. 
Joseph Bonaparte headed a group of Bonapartists who sought to divert the 
people's attention from the struggle against the regime of the Second Empire 
by means of social demagogy and sham opposition to the government's 
policy.—66, 76, 208, 300, 567 
94 Marx's letter to Paris, presumably addressed to Victor Schily, has not been 
found.—66 
95 Marx is referring to the discussion of the conflict in the Paris Section by the 
Central Council on 24 January 1865. 
The Paris Section of the International Association was founded at the end 
of 1864 by the Proudhonistically-minded workers, Henri Tolain and Charles 
Limousin who took part in the inaugural meeting of 28 September 1864 at St 
Martin's Hall. Besides Tolain's group, a French lawyer and bourgeois 
republican, Henri Lefort, who also participated in organising the 28 September 
meeting, likewise claimed to be representative of French workers. Soon it 
became evident that Lefort was in touch with the Council's Corresponding 
Secretary for France, Le Lubez, and with the French petty-bourgeois refugees 
in England who strove to bring their influence on the International Working 
Men's Association. The bourgeois republicans accused Tolain of being in 
contact with the Bonapartists (in particular with Prince Joseph Bonaparte). The 
accusation was published by Moses Hess in Der Social-Demokrat. In reply to 
Marx's enquiry sent to Schily and Schweitzer, the former answered on 
19 January 1865 that Tolain's libellous accusation had originated with the 
people close to L'Association, the journal of co-operative societies, of which 
Lefort was an editor. Schily also promised to send additional information. 
The conflict in the Paris Section was repeatedly discussed in the 
Sub-Committee and the Central Council in February and March 1865. Marx 
sought to protect the section from attacks by bourgeois republicans and, at the 
same time, to find ways of overcoming the influence of Proudhonist Utopian 
ideas on the French workers—66, 80, 108, 115, 118, 130 
96 Sections of the International Associations began to be set up in Switzerland 
immediately after the press reports about the inaugural meeting at St Martin's 
Hall. On 11 October 1864, a group of Geneva workers headed by François 
Dupleix, a bookbinder, formed a provisional committee to establish contacts 
with the workers of other countries. At the Central Council meeting on 
24 January 1865 the news about the Geneva workers' intention to affiliate to 
the International was met with approval. Hermann Jung, the Corresponding 
Secretary for Switzerland, sent Dupleix the Rules of the International Working 
Men's Association; he also advised the Swiss workers, in the name of the 
Central Council, to set up a Central Committee for the whole of Switzerland. 
The above-mentioned soirée to celebrate the founding of the International 
Working Men's Association was arranged on 16 January 1865 at Cambridge 
Hall, London.—66 
97 This reference is to the British National League for the Independence of Poland 
founded in London on 28 July 1863. Its establishment was preceded by a 
meeting at St James's Hall on 22 July arranged to express solidarity with the 
participants in the Polish insurrection (see Note 24). The meeting, which was 
one of the harbingers in the founding of the International, was attended by 
British trade unionists and representatives of the international democratic

movement, as well as by a French workers' delegation from Paris. The meeting 
resolved to send a delegation to the Foreign Secretary, John Russell, to hand in 
a protest against the British government's double-faced policy towards the 
Polish insurgents. Russell refused to receive the delegation, and a second 
meeting was called on 28 July 1863, this time at the premises of The Bee-Hive 
Newspaper, at which the League was founded. Radical Edmond Beales was 
elected president and John R. Taylor—honorary secretary. 
By the Polish society here Marx means the revolutionary democrats from 
among the Polish émigrés in London grouped round the representative of the 
National Central Committee of Poland that stood at the head of the 1863-64 
uprising. At the Central Council's meeting on 10 January 1865, also attended 
by representatives of the National League and the National Central Committee 
of Poland, a resolution was passed which emphasised that 'this Association 
pledges itself to assist by all means in its power the commemoration of the 
glorious, though unsuccessful, Revolution of  1863'. 
The 'meeting for the Poles' mentioned by Marx took place on 1 March 1865 
(see Note 168).—66, 86, 109 
98 Wilhelm Liebknecht wrote to Marx before 20 January 1865 that he had learned 
of Ferdinand Lassalle's agreement with Bismarck's government: he promised 
support from the General Association of German Workers over the annexation 
of Schleswig-Holstein by Prussia if it introduced universal suffrage. Marx and 
Engels regarded this political 'bequest' by Lassalle as betrayal of the proletariat's 
interests. The Lassalle-Bismarck correspondence published in 1928 fully 
confirmed Liebknecht's information.—66, 69, 71, 75, 102, 124, 566 
99 A reference to the members of the Party of  Progress  formed in June 1861 (the 
most eminent figures were Waldeck, Virchow, Schulze-Delitzsch, Forchenbeck 
and Hoverbeck). The party's slogans were the unification of Germany under 
the aegis of Prussia, the convocation of an all-German Parliament, and the 
formation of a strong liberal Ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. 
Fearing a popular revolution, the Party of Progress gave no support to the 
basic democratic demands—universal suffrage and freedoms of the press, 
association and assembly. In 1866 the party split, and its Right wing founded 
the National Liberal Party, which capitulated to the Bismarck government.—67, 
69, 71, 75, 84, 90, 96, 97, 104, 111, 150, 176, 288, 421, 430, 456 
100 Xhe constitutional conflict in Prussia arose in February 1860 over the refusal of 
the bourgeois majority of the Lower Chamber of the Prussian Provincial Diet to 
confirm the army reorganisation project proposed by War Minister von Roon. 
However, the government soon managed to secure allocations from the 
Provincial Diet to 'maintain the army ready for action', which in fact meant the 
beginning of the planned reorganisation. When, in March 1862, the liberal 
majority of the Chamber refused to endorse military expenses and demanded a 
Ministry responsible to the Provincial Diet, the government dissolved the Diet 
and announced new elections. The Bismarck Ministry was formed at the end of 
September 1862. In October it again dissolved the Provincial Diet and began to 
carry out the military reform without the sanction of the Diet. The conflict was 
settled only in 1866 when, after Prussia's victory over Austria, the Prussian 
bourgeoisie capitulated to Bismarck.—68, 82, 84

104 By Hess' 'expulsion from Brussels' Marx means his departure from Belgium's 
capital in March 1846 due to the aggravated ideological struggle between the 
Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee, headed by Marx and Engels, 
and the representatives of petty-bourgeois 'true socialism' of which Hess was 
one of the spokesmen. 
By the 'ejection from Cologne' Marx means Hess' forced departure from 
Rhenish Prussia in the spring of 1848, when Marx and Engels thwarted the 
attempt of Hess and his followers to take over from the proletarian 
revolutionaries the initiative in starting a revolutionary democratic newspaper 
in Cologne.—70 
105 Marx realised this intention in a footnote to the Preface to the first German 
edition (1867) of Volume One of Capital (see present edition, Vol.  35).—71,  329 
106 Neither letters  nor  written statements  by  Marx  to the  editor  of Der 
Social-Demokrat have been found.—71 
107 A reference to the workers' right to organise trade unions and to go on strike. 
In January 1865 the Prussian Provincial Diet debated the right of association in 
connection with the workers' opposition to the trade regulations then in force. 
Two members of the Party of Progress, Schulze-Delitzsch and Faucher, used the 
occasion to have the articles restraining capitalism repealed. They proposed to 
revoke Article 181, which forbade employers to resort to lockouts, and also 
demagogically demanded the cancellation of Article 182 concerning the 
punishment of workers for incitement to strike. The workers in turn wanted the 
repeal of Article 183 which made them obtain police permission to form 
associations, and of Article 184 banning strikes. 
On 14 February 1865 the Prussian Provincial Diet annulled Articles 181 
and 182 and left the workers' demand for freedom of association unsatisfied.— 
71 
108 The  decree  of the  Constituent Assembly  of 14  June  1791  declared strikes  to be 
a 'crime against freedom  and the  declaration  of the  rights  of man' and the 
formation  of  workers' associations  was  liable  to a  fine  of 500  livres  and 
deprivation  of political rights  for a  year.  Le Chapellier made  a report  on this 
subject.  The  Chapellier  Law was in  force  in France  (as  regards prohibition  of 
strikes) till  1864,  while  the  freedom  of activity  for the  trade unions  was not 
legalised until 1884.—71 
109 Yhe Ten  Hours' Bill  the  struggle  for  which  had  been waged  for  many years, 
was passed  by Parliament  in 1847,  against  a background  of sharply intensified 
contradictions between  the  landed aristocracy  and the  industrial bourgeoisie, 
generated  by the  repeal  of the  Corn Laws  in 1846. In  revenge  on the  industrial 
bourgeoisie, some Tory  MPs  supported  the  Bill.  Its provisions applied only  to 
women and children. Nevertheless, many manufacturers evaded it in practice.—

Capital on share principles. Meissner wanted to have the manuscript for study 
(see also Note 66). Strohn also wrote that Meissner had received, through a

publication of periodicals, and that Ferdinand Freiligrath had promised to 
contribute to Blind's republican newspaper.—72

112 On 28 January 1865, on Lincoln's instructions the American Envoy Adams hand­
ed over the President's reply to the address of the Central Council of the 
International (see Note 70). This reply, in the form of Adams' letter, was 
published in The Times, No.  25101,  on 6 February 1865, under the title 'Mr. 
Lincoln and the International Working Men's Association'.—  73, 80, 86, 161 
us The Emancipation Society was founded in London in November 1862 by English 
bourgeois radicals. It supported the London Trades Council (see Note 18) in 
its campaign against Britain's interference in the US Civil War (1861-65) on the 
side of the South (see Note 11). Among its leading figures were Edmond 
Beales, Edward Beesly and John Stuart Mill.—73, 74, 86 
114 The Literary Society of the Friends of Poland was founded in Paris in April 1832 
by the aristocratic-monarchist Polish emigres under Adam Czartoryski. Its 
London branch was set up in the same year with the help of English aristocrats 
from among the Whig Party.— 73 
115 At the Central Council meeting of 31 January 1865 a letter was read from 
Léon Fontaine, a member of the Belgian democratic Universal Federation. In 
his letter dated 29 January, Fontaine wrote that the Federation had decided to 
join the International Association and intended to translate the Association's 
documents into French. As it turned out later, Fontaine had no connections 
with the workers and did not take any further steps to establish a section of the 
International. The first section in Belgium was set up on 17 July 1865 with the 
direct participation of the Belgian socialist César de Paepe. — 73 
116 This refers to the participation of Central Council members in a preliminary 
conference of electoral reform supporters scheduled for 6 February 1865. At 
this conference, a group of bourgeois radicals set up a provisional committee to 
convoke a meeting in support of manhood suffrage in London on 23 February. 
Marx attached great importance to the campaign for the démocratisation of 
Britain's political system. He therefore thought it possible to co-operate with 
the bourgeois radicals but on conditions that would ensure a genuinely 
democratic reform as well as an independent and leading role for the 
International Working Men's Association in the reform campaign. 
At its meeting on 31 January 1865, the Central Council elected a deputation 
to the reform conference. Besides Eccarius and Le Lubez, it included Carter, 
Odger, Whitlock, Cremer, Wheeler and Dell.— 74 
117 Marx's letter to Jones has not been found. As can be seen from Jones' reply of 
10 February 1865, Marx outlined a plan for drawing the masses of English 
workers into a reform campaign under the leadership of the Central Council of 
the International, and substantiated its platform (the demand for manhood 
suffrage, etc.). In his letter Jones expressed his agreement with the platform, 
emphasising, in particular, the need to oppose the moderate position of the 
Manchester liberal bourgeoisie on this question.—  74, 91

119 On 1 February 1865 Carl Siebel wrote to Marx that he had met Carl Klings 
after the general assembly of the Lassallean General Association of German 
Workers in Düsseldorf at the end of December 1864. Therefore Marx's 
recommendation to Klings, sent through Siebel, that the general assembly 
should propose the Association's affiliation to the International, reached him 
too late (see Note 82).—75, 78 
120 -phe cutting from the Rheinische Zeitung enclosed in Siebel's letter to Marx of 
1 February 1865 has not been found. Siebel assumed that the leading article-
was written by Hermann Becker (Red Becker). Judging by Liebknecht's letter 
to Marx of 16 February, the author contrasted the revolutionary position of 
Marx and Engels who supported the democrats against the government with 
that of the Lassalleans who supported the government against the democrats.— 
75, 80 
121 Marx's letter to Schweitzer with a proposal that the latter should stand up to 
Bismarck in Der Social-Demokrat has not been found. It is quite possible that 
Marx wrote about this in the final version of his letter to Schweitzer of 
16 January 1865. The draft of this undiscovered letter is published on 
pp. 64-65 of this volume.—  75, 95 
122 Der Social-Demokrat, No. 16 for 1 February 1865, published an item 'Paris, 
28.Januar. Internationale Arbeiter- Association.—Geldkrisis' (signed H). It 
repeated the libel that the French members of the International (Henri Tolain 
and Charles Limousin) were in contact with the Bonapartists (see Note 91).— 
75 
123 The coup d'état in Prussia in November-December 1848 resulted in the 
dissolution of the National Assembly (convened in Berlin in May 1848 to draw 
up a constitution). The constitution imposed ('granted') by the King introduced 
a two-chamber system; the First Chamber was transformed by age and property 
qualifications into a privileged 'chamber of the nobility'. According to the 
electoral law of 6 December 1848, the right to vote in the two-stage elections to 
the Second Chamber was granted only to the so-called independent Prussians. 
In April 1849 Frederick William IV dissolved this Chamber and promulgated a 
new electoral law on 30 May which established a three-class election system 
based on high property qualifications and unequal representation of the 
various strata of the population.— 76 
124 Road  books  (Wanderbücher) were issued in Prussia to journeymen artisans under 
the law introduced in 1831. They recorded their places of residence and 
contained an assessment of their trustworthiness.—77 
25 Marx attached to this letter his rough copy of a statement to the editor of Der 
Social-Demokrat (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 36) with a protest against the 
publication of the report by Hess, who libellously accused the French members 
of the International (see Note 91). The criticism by Marx and Engels 
compelled the editors to change the newspaper's tone to some extent. Issue 
No. 21 of 12 February 1865 carried an item by Hess in which he withdrew his 
accusations. For that reason Marx and Engels did not insist on the publication 
of their statement. However, they decided to stop contributing to the

newspaper for the time being. Marx and Engels announced their final break 
with Der Social-Demokrat on 23 February 1865 (see this volume, p.  97).—  79, 95 
'26 Marx forwarded to Engels Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter of 4 February 1865 in 
which Liebknecht treated collaboration on Der Social-Demokrat as a compromise 
with the Lassalleans. He also described his material hardships and asked Marx to 
find a place for him as a schoolmaster in northern England or Scotland. 
Marx's postscript to this letter to Engels (originally written at the end of 
Liebknecht's letter) was published in previous editions as a separate letter.—80, 81 
127 On 8 February 1865, War Minister Roon spoke in the Chamber of Deputies 
about his Bill on changes in and addenda to the Prussian law on military 
service. These changes signified minor concessions to the opposition bourgeois 
majority in the Chamber and did not resolve the constitutional conflict (see 
Note 100).—83 
'28 Marx supported Lefort's appointment as the International's literary defender in 
Paris because he had gathered from Schily's letter of 5 February 1865 that the 
conflict in the Paris Section (see Note 95) had been resolved. He hoped this 
would help to draw French workers active in the co-operative movement into 
the International and also to utilise the journal L'Association for propagating 
the International's ideas. 
When translating the Provisional Rules of the Association into French, at the 
end of 1864, the Proudhonist leaders of the Paris Section distorted the text in 
some places. In particular, in the third paragraph of the Preamble to the Rules 
('That the economical emancipation of the working classes is therefore the 
great end to which every political movement ought to be subordinate as a 
means'), the words 'as a means' were omitted.—85 
129 On Marx's advice Engels formulated this passage in his pamphlet in such a way 
that it could not have been interpreted as the author's agreement with Lassalle's 
slogans. He also incorporated the suggestion Marx made below on changing 
the description of the position of the German bourgeoisie during the 1848-
49 revolution in Germany (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 69 and 57).—87 
130 On 27 March 1849 the Frankfurt National Assembly, elected in April-May 1848 
to draw up an all-German Constitution, adopted a law introducing direct 
universal suffrage. The law was published by the Imperial Regent, Archduke 
John, in an official government edition on 12 April 1849. Since, however, the 
King of Prussia and other German princes had rejected the Imperial 
Constitution drawn by the National Assembly, the law was not put into 
effect.—87

England's conservative politicians and writers in the 1830s-50s, including the 
Young England group, whose members (Disraeli and Ferrand among them) 
founded a separate group in the House of Commons in 1841. Voicing the 
discontent of the landed aristocracy at the growing economic and political 
power of the bourgeoisie, the Tory philanthropists criticised the capitalist 
system and supported the half-hearted measures for improving the condition 
of the workers. However, they adopted a hostile attitude to the independent 
revolutionary working-class movement.— 88

133 Marx forwarded Engels a letter from Johann Baptist Schweitzer of 11 February 
1865.  It was written in reply to the statement by Marx and Engels concern­
ing Hess' insinuations against the French members of the International. 
In his letter Schweitzer promised to publish immediately an item by Hess 
admitting his assertions to be erroneous (see Note 125). Below Marx drew 
Engels' attention to this item.— 89 
134 Neither the original of Marx's letter to Johann Baptist Schweitzer of 
13 February 1865 nor the copy of it which Marx retained has survived. 
However, a large fragment from it is quoted in Marx's letter to Engels of 
18 February (see this volume, pp. 95-96). In this volume, this fragment is not 
published separately but within the above-mentioned letter to Engels. — 89, 95, 
108 
136 On 11 February 1865 the Minister of Commerce, Count Itzenplitz, read out a 
government statement in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies during the debate 
on the right of combination (see Note 107). In an attempt to maintain the ban 
on the formation of workers' associations, the government demagogically 
alleged that freedom of association could not improve the workers' condition 
and proposed instead to help in setting up workers' co-operatives.—90 
13R The Rules Governing Servants (Gesindeordnung) —the feudal rules and regula­
tions that existed in Prussian provinces in the 18th and early 19th centuries and 
sanctioned the big landowners' arbitrary treatment of servants and agricultural 
labourers, including corporal punishment.— 90, 96, 104 
137 The Order of the Swan, a German mediaeval religious order of knights, was 
founded in Brandenburg in 1443 and disintegrated during the Reformation. In 
1843 Frederick William IV of Prussia made an abortive attempt to restore this 
Order, hoping that its philanthropic activity would enhance the prestige of the 
Prussian monarchy which, he claimed, had a social mission.— 90 
138 The campaign for the right of combination was launched by the Berlin printers 
in early 1865 under the influence of Wilhelm Liebknecht's propaganda. When 
the leaders of the Lassallean General Association of German Workers realised 
that the campaign was widely supported by the workers, they decided to join it 
too, despite Lassalle, who held that associations were of no use for the workers. 
On 1 February 1865, Der Social-Demohrat published Bernhard Becker's 
instructions for the General Association's representatives with a proposal that, 
at their meetings, the workers should adopt resolution demanding the abolition 
of articles 183 and 184 of trade regulations (see Note 107) that prohibited 
associations and strikes.—90 
139 Marx is referring to Eccarius' articles in Der Social-Demokrat. Eccarius continued 
to contribute to the paper for some time after Marx had actually ceased 
co-operating with it (see Note 125). His last article was printed in Der 
Social-Demokrat on 31 March 1865.—91 
140 At a meeting of the Central Council of the International held on 14 February 
1865,  Marx read out Ernest Jones' letter to him of 10 February, which was a 
reply to Marx's letter of 1 February (Marx's letter is not extant) and written 
with a view to being read at the Council. Jones agreed with Marx's plan 
for drawing the broad mass of British workers into the electoral reform 
movement.— 91 
141 Marx forwarded to Engels a letter from a Cologne worker, G. Matzeratt, to 
Friedrich Lessner dated 8 January 1865. Matzeratt wrote about the disagree-

ments between Bernhard Becker and Carl Klings in the General Association of 
German Workers. On behalf of a group of the Association's members, he asked 
Lessner to inquire about Marx's opinion and help them to clarify the matter. 
As can be seen from Engels' letter to Marx of 7 February 1865, Becker gained 
the upper hand over Klings (see this volume, p. 82).—94 
142 During the debate on the right of combination in the Prussian Chamber of 
Deputies (see Note 107), Hermann Heinrich Becker, a deputy from Dortmund, 
moved a proposal, on 11 February 1865, that the right of combination be 
extended to the agricultural labourers as well. He also proposed to abolish the 
law of 24 April 1854 on the punishment of servants and day labourers for the 
violation of their duties.—94 
143 This  refers to Liebknecht's withdrawal from the editorial board of Der 
Social-Demokrat, of which Liebknecht informed Marx in a letter dated 16-17 
February 1865.—94, 108 
144 -phe passage in Schweitzer's letter of 15 February 1865 to Marx, written in 
reply to Marx's letter of 13 February, reads as follows: 'If you wish to enlighten 
me, as in your last letter, on theoretical questions, I would gratefully accept 
such instruction on your part. But as regards the practical questions of 
immediate tactics I beg you to consider that in order to assess these things one 
must be in the centre of the movement. You are therefore doing us an injustice 
if you express your dissatisfaction with our tactics anywhere and anyhow. You 
should only do this if you were absolutely familiar with conditions.'—95 
145 Marx is referring to the third article in Schweitzer's series Das Ministerium 
Bismarck. It was published in Der Social-Demokrat, No. 23, 17 February 1865, 
i.e. after Marx's demand for a stop to the flirtation with Bismarck. In these 
articles Schweitzer supported Bismarck's policy of unifying Germany under the 
supremacy of Prussia and approved of the Prussian government's demagogical 
attempts to show that it favoured a solution to the labour question.—95, 104 
146 A reference to the 'liberal' course announced by Prince William of Prussia 
(King of Prussia from 1861) when he became Regent in October 1858. He 
made the Manteuffel Ministry resign and called the moderate liberals to power. 
The bourgeois press dubbed this the policy of the 'New Era'. It was, in fact, 
solely intended to strengthen the position of the Prussian monarchy and the 
Junkers. This soon became clear to the representatives of the liberal opposition 
whose hopes had been deceived and who refused to approve the government 
project of a military reform. The constitutional conflict (see Note 100) that 
ensued and Bismarck's advance to power in September 1862 put an end to the 
'New Era'.—96, 103 
147 Marx refers to the journal of German petty-bourgeois democrats, Der deutsche 
Eidgenosse, published in London and Hamburg from 1865 to 1867. Among its 
editors were Karl Blind, Ludwig Büchner, Ferdinand Freiligrath, Ludwig 
Feuerbach and Ernst Haug.— 97 
148 Marx enclosed in this letter to Engels some scraps of paper, in an unknown 
hand, about the unseemly behaviour of people from the élite of the Second 
Empire.—99 
149 -phe full text of the letter has not been found. This excerpt has been preserved 
in Marx's Notebook for 1865; it is also quoted by Marx in a letter to Engels of 
25 February 1865 (see this volume, pp. 107-08).—101

150 At the beginning of February 1865 Marx made a speech at the celebration of 
the 25th anniversary of the German Workers' Educational Society in London 
(see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 360). He criticised the views of the Lassalleans, 
in particular their dogma about the assistance by the existing state to workers' 
co-operative societies. The report on the celebration meeting was drawn up by 
Eccarius and published in Der Social-Demokrat, No. 24, 19 February 1865. The 
content of Marx's speech was presented by Eccarius inaccurately. He ascribed 
to Marx the idea that joint action by the proletariat and the bourgeoisie against 
the feudal monarchy was impossible. 
The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 
1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the 
Just. After the foundation of the Communist League (see Note 17), the latter's 
local communities played the leading role in the Society. In 1847 and 1849-50, 
Marx and Engels took an active part in its work, but on 17 September 1850 
Marx, Engels and a number of their followers withdrew because the 
Willich-Schapper sectarian-adventurist group had increased their influence in 
the Society. In the late 1850s, Marx and Engels resumed their work in the 
Educational Society. During the activity of the International Working Men's 
Association the Society (Lessner was one of its leaders) was its German Section in 
London. The Educational Society in London existed until 1918, when it was closed 
down by the British government.—101, 106, 107, 507 
151 In his letter to Marx of 19 February 1865, Ludwig Kugelmann enclosed a letter 
from Miquel, a former member of the Communist League, dated 22 December 
1864.  Miquel alleged in it that Marx's work A Contribution to the Critique of 
Political Economy 'contains little of what is actually new' and that its conclusions 
were not applicable to Germany's social and political conditions. At the same 
time,  Miquel tried to justify his desertion to the liberal camp.—102, 107, 112 
152 The National Association (Deutscher National-Verein) was a party of the 
German liberal bourgeoisie which advocated the unification of Germany 
(without Austria) in a centralised state under the supremacy of the Prussian 
monarchy. Its inaugural meeting was held in Frankfurt am Main in September 
1859.  The National Association was dissolved in November 1867, after the 
Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the establishment of the North German 
Confederation.—102, 163, 204, 207, 266, 280, 340, 361, 365, 372 
153 On 20 March 1848, King Frederick William IV of Prussia declared that he was 
ready, for the salvation of Germany's unity and freedom, to 'assume the 
leadership of the whole nation'. Hence the phrase 'Prussian leadership' 
("preussische Spitze'), which won currency as a euphemism for Prussia's efforts 
to unite the country under its supremacy.—103 
154 In connection with the enthronement of King William I of Prussia an amnesty 
was granted in Prussia on 12 January 1861 guaranteeing, in words, all political 
refugees unimpeded return to the country. In the spring of 1861, during his 
stay in Berlin, Marx submitted an application to the Prussian government 
requesting the restoration of his Prussian citizenship. His request was rejected 
by the Prussian authorities on the grounds that in 1845 Marx had surrendered his 
status as a Prussian of his 'own free will' and 'therefore' could be regarded 'as a 
foreigner' (see present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 339-58).—105, 201 
155 On 23 February 1865 a public meeting was held in St Martin's Hall, London. 
On the initiative and with the direct participation of the Central Council of the 
International Association, the meeting passed a decision to found a Reform

League as a centre of the mass electoral reform movement. The League's 
leading bodies—the Council and the Executive Committee—included the 
Central Council members of the International, mainly British trade union 
leaders. The programme of the movement was drafted under the influence of 
Marx who was advocating the independent position of the British working class 
in the reform campaign. Unlike the bourgeois parties, which confined their 
demand to household suffrage, the Reform League, on Marx's insistence, 
advanced the demand for manhood suffrage. The League had branches in all 
big industrial cities and in provinces. However, the vacillations of the bourgeois 
radical leaders, who became afraid of the movement's mass character, and the 
conciliation of the trade union leaders prevented the League from following 
the line charted by the Central Council of the International. The British 
bourgeoisie succeeded in splitting the movement, and a moderate reform was 
carried out in 1867 which granted franchise only to the petty bourgeoisie and 
the upper layers of the working class.—105, 108, 130, 150, 243, 251, 327, 574 
156 The Combination Law of 11 March 1850 in force in Prussia banned all societies 
that established contacts with other organisations abroad. Hence, this law 
prevented the setting up of societies in Germany connected with the 
International Association and the affiliation to it of those already existing. 
Therefore, as far back as February 1865 Marx proposed to accept the form of 
individual membership in Germany that would allow to evade the existing laws, 
and that proved to be a rather flexible means of drawing the advanced German 
workers into the ranks of the International.—105 
157 This refers to the leading article in Der Social-Demokrat, No. 25, 22 February 
1865,  which was reprinted from the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung of 
19 February 1865.—106 
158 Thanks to Liebknecht and Siebel, Marx and Engels' statement about their 
break with Der Social-Demokrat (see this volume, p. 97) was published in many 
German newspapers, among them Barmer Zeitung and Elberfelder Zeitung 
(No.  60) on 26 February 1865; Düsseldorfer Zeitung (No. 59) on 28 February; 
Rheinische Zeitung (No. 60), Berliner Reform (No. 51), Neue Frankfurter Zeitung 
(No.  60), Breslauer Zeitung (No. 102), Staatsbürger-Zeitung (No. 60) on 1 March, 
and later in several other papers. 
The above-mentioned letters of Marx to Schweitzer and Liebknecht about the 
said statement have not been found.— 108 
159 It is clear from Schily's letter to Marx of 25 February 1865, and the 'Private 
Instruction to Schily' extant in Marx's notebook (see present edition, Vol. 20, 
p. 83), that Marx's instructions were aimed at finding such a way of settling the 
conflict in the Paris organisation of the International Association that would 
strengthen the position of the Paris Section's Administration and help draw 
into the International those workers who were still under the influence of 
bourgeois republicans (participants in the co-operative movement, and so 
on).—108,  127 
160 The  'Resolutions of the Central Council on the Conflict in the Paris Section', 
adopted on 7 March 1865 (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 82-83), acknowl­
edged as erroneous the view typical of the Proudhonists, in particular the 
Administration of the Paris Section of the International, that only a worker can be 
an official in a workers' organisation. This Proudhonist view was ultimately 
rejected by the Geneva Congress of the International held in September 1866 (see 
Noie 380).—109

161 Participation in the solidarity meeting with the Polish national liberation 
movement, called to mark the first anniversary of the Polish insurrection of 
1863-64, was discussed by the Central Council on 21 February 1865. The 
following resolution was adopted unanimously: 'That the Central Council of 
the International Working Men's Association lend their unreserved support to 
the commemorative meeting for Poland on March 1st at St Martin's Hall, and 
they invite the attendance thereat of their friends.'—109 
162 On 24 February 1865, The Morning Star printed a notice, 'German Democracy', 
obviously written by Karl Blind, about the forthcoming publication of the 
journal Der deutsche Eidgenosse (see Note 147).— 110 
163 Engels' notice announcing the publication of his pamphlet The Prussian Military 
Question and the German Workers' Party (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 81) was 
printed anonymously in a number of German papers with the help of Carl 
Siebel, Johann Klein and Wilhelm Liebknecht (Engels' letters to Klein and 
Liebknecht requesting to publish the notice have not been found). The notice 
was published anonymously in Berliner Reform (No. 53), Düsseldorfer Zeitung 
(No.  62), Elberfelder Zeitung (No. 62) and Rheinische Zeitung (No. 62) on 
3 March 1865; Oberrheinische Courier (No. 56) on 7 March, and others. 
Moreover, on 9 March the Rheinische Zeitung carried a special article 'Für die 
Arbeiterpartei' about Engels' pamphlet containing long passages from it.— 111, 
112 
64 Engels is referring to the silence of the German press over his anonymously 
published pamphlets Po and Rhine (1859) and Savoy, Nice and the Rhine (1860) 
(see present edition, Vol. 16).— 111 
65 Since Marx and Engels' statement was published in many German newspapers 
(see Note 158), Schweitzer was compelled to print it in Der Social-Demokrat too 
(it appeared there only on 3 March 1865 in issue No. 29).—113 
66 This refers to Schweitzer's article published in Der Social-Demokrat, No. 29, 
3 March 1865, in the section 'Politische Theil'. It said that the German 
Social-Democrats who were not members of the General Association of German 
Workers did not belong to the Social-Democratic Party. By this attack on Marx, 
Engels and their close associates in Germany, the editors of Der Social-Demokrat 
sought to weaken the impression of Marx and Engels' statement on their 
breach with the newspaper. See also Engels' letter to Joseph Weydemeyer of 
10 March 1865 (this volume, pp. 124-25).—114, 116, 125 
67 Marx succeeded in having items about Engels' The Prussian Military Question 
and the German Workers' Party published in the German-language newspapers in 
London. On 17 March 1865 such an item appeared in the Londoner Anzeiger, 
and on 18 March the Hermann published, also anonymously, Marx's review of 
the pamphlet (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 85-86). 
Marx's letter to Ludwig Kugelmann, mentioned above, concerning the 
popularisation of Engels' pamphlet has not been found.—114 
H8 The meeting to mark the anniversary of the Polish insurrection of 1863-64 was 
held in St Martin's Hall, London, on 1 March 1865. It was initiated by the 
British National League for the Independence of Poland (see Note 97), and the 
Central Council of the International contributed much to preparing and 
conducting it (see Note 161). The British bourgeois press, the London liberal 
Daily News included, covered the speeches Beales, Leverson and other 
bourgeois radicals made at the meeting, but passed over in silence a resolution

submitted on behalf of the International and the speeches of Peter Fox and 
Georg Eccarius, the Central Council members. A full report of the meeting 
appeared in The Bee-Hive Newspaper (No. 177) on 4 March 1865, and Marx 
used it when writing his notice entitled 'A Correction' and intended for the 
Zurich Der weiße Adler, which reproduced a garbled report from the British 
newspapers (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 97-98).—114, 130, 143 
169 The reference is to the manuscript of The Great Men of the Exile written by 
Marx and Engels (see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 227-326). At the end of 
June 1852, Marx passed on the manuscript to the Hungarian émigré Bangya 
who offered to have it published in Germany. Later, it turned out that Bangya 
was a police spy and had handed over the manuscript to the Prussian police. 
The actions of Bangya, who managed to win Marx's confidence for a time, 
were unmasked by Marx in his article 'Hirsch's Confessions', written in April 
1853 and published in American newspapers (see present edition, Vol. 12, 
pp. 40-43). 
Marx also exposed Bangya as a spy and an agent provocateur in Herr Vogt, 
published in 1860 (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 219—20).—118, 176, 191 
170 The Prussian authorities managed to suppress the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, 
published by Marx and Engels during the 1848-49 revolution in Germany, by 
means of repressive measures against its editors. On 16 May 1849, its 
editor-in-chief Marx, who had just returned from his trip to Northern 
Germany, was ordered to leave Prussia within 24 hours on the pretext that he 
was a foreigner who had no Prussian citizenship and had violated the rights of 
hospitality. Ernst Dronke and Georg Weerth, members of the editorial board, 
were deported for the same reasons, while Engels was prosecuted for 
participating in an uprising in Elberfeld, Rhine Province. The last issue of the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung, printed in red ink, appeared on 19 May 1849.—118 
171 The People's Bank (Credit au travail) was founded in Paris in 1863 by the 
petty-bourgeois socialist Jean Pierre Béluze to grant credits to producer and 
consumer co-operative societies and draw workers' savings to promote the 
co-operative movement. It existed until 1868.—119 
172 The first issue of Der deutsche Eidgenosse, of 15 March 1865, published Karl 
Blind's address to all friends inviting them to contribute to the journal, as well 
as Gustav Struve's article, 'Die "Teig-Gesichter" in Deutschland', and Gustav 
Rasch's 'Ein Immortellenkranz auf das Grab eines Märtyrers (Max Dortu)'. 
On the title page of the journal an emblem consisting of a hand with dagger 
was printed with the inscription in Latin: 'Manus haec inimica tyrannies' ('This 
hand is the Enemy of Tyrants').—119 
173 In its issue No. 31 of 8 March 1865, Der Social-Demokrat published the 
statement by Georg Herwegh and Friedrich Wilhelm Rüstow of their refusal, 
following Marx and Engels, to contribute to this newspaper. Commenting on the 
statement, Schweitzer distorted Marx's and Engels' attitude to Lassalle and 
falsified the reasons for their withdrawal from the editorial board of Der 
Social-Demokrat. To prove that Marx and Engels were allegedly inconsistent and 
their actions unjustified, Schweitzer quoted Karl Blind's article published in the 
Neue Frankfurter Zeitung, No. 64, 5 March 1865.—120, 126, 129

in particular the Red River expedition by Northern troops in 1864, undertaken 
with a view to entrenching themselves in Texas. General Banks, who headed 
the expedition, marched from New Orleans and intended to join forces at 
Shreveport with General Steel who set out from Arkansas. However, Banks' 
troops were suddenly attacked by the Southerners in the Texas woods and 
were forced to retreat.—121 
175 Missunde—a Danish stronghold captured by Prussian troops on 2 February 
1864,  during the Danish war (see Note 9).—121 
176 This refers to the military operations between the allied Anglo-Spanish-
Portuguese troops under Wellington and those of Napoleonic France on the 
Peninsula in 1808-14, and to the Crimean war, 1853-56, between Britain, 
France, Turkey and later Piedmont, on the one hand, and Tsarist Russia, on 
the other. 
The battle of Alma took place during the Crimean war, on 20 September 
1854.  It was the first battle after the Allies' landing at Eupatoria in the Crimea 
on 14 September. The defeat and withdrawal of the Russian troops opened up 
the way to Sevastopol for the Allies.—122 
177 Marx stayed with his relatives, the Philipses, at Zalt-Bommel (Holland) from 
19 March to 8 April 1865.—128, 133, 139, 566 
178 In his comments on the statement of Herwegh and Rüstow, Schweitzer quoted 
Blind's article (see Note 173) mentioning the following passage from Marx's 
private letter of condolence to Sophie von Hatzfeldt, written on 12 September 
1864 on the occasion of Lassalle's death: 'He died young, at a time of triumph, 
as an Achilles' (see present edition, Vol. 41, p. 563). These words taken from 
the letter, without Marx's knowledge and consent, were published in Der 
Social-Demokrat, No. 1, 15 December 1864, over his signature and were used 
to extol Lassalle. In due time Marx lodged a protest against this breach of 
ethics on Schweitzer's part.—129 
179 Marx realised his intention by writing, on 15 March 1865, the 'Statement 
Regarding the Causes of the Breach with the Social-Demokrat'. It was published 
in the Berliner Reform (No. 67) on 19 March 1865 (see present edition, Vol. 20, 
pp. 87-90).—129 
180 Marx enclosed in his letter the text of the Central Council's resolutions on the 
conflict in the Paris Section (see Note 95) written by him and approved by the 
Council on 7 March 1865, and the text of the private instruction to Schily who 
was appointed a special representative of the Central Council in the Paris 
Administration (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 82-83).—130 
181 On 11 March 1865, in Radleys Hotel, London, there was a conference of the 
workers' delegation elected at the meeting in St. Martin's Hall (see Note 155) 
and representatives of the radical and liberal bourgeoisie. This conference, 
sponsored by participants in the electoral reform movement, was a step in 
founding the Reform League. About 20 trade union delegates, among them 
members of the Central Council of the International, and as many bourgeois 
representatives, including four MPs, attended the conference. John Bright, leader 
of the Free Traders, advocated household suffrage. The demand for manhood 
suffrage was rejected by the bourgeois delegates, and no agreement on joint 
action was reached. 
Marx's letter to Jones mentioned above has not been found.—130

182 In its issue No. 299 of 4 March 1865, the Nordstern, published by Karl Bruhn, 
carried two leading articles in which the editors came out against any 
compromise with the government and described people of Schweitzer's type as 
intriguers.—130 
183 This refers to the resolutions on the conflict in the Paris Section (see Note 95) 
adopted by the Central Council of the International on 7 March 1865. 
No letter from Marx to Cremer has been found, nor has the letter to Schily 
of 13 March 1865, which he wanted to send.—131 
184 On 12 March 1865 Jung wrote to tell Marx that the Central Council had instructed 
him to draw up a summary of the conflict in the Paris Section for the informa­
tion of the International's members in France, and asked Marx to help him 
in the matter. On 18 March Marx met Jung and handed him his 
written remarks on the latter's document. (For Marx's comments, entitled 
'Memorandum to Hermann Jung about the Conflict in the Paris Section', see 
present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 331-36.)—132 
185 The Berliner Reform of 3 March, the Rheinische Zeitung of 4 March 1865 and 
other German papers published a report on Marx's and Engels' break with 
Der Sociat-Demokrat which Wilhelm Liebknecht made on 28 February in the Berlin 
Printers' Association that declared its adhesion to the International. The 
printers approved of Marx and Engels' statement of 23 February and 
Liebknecht's refusal to contribute to Der Social-Demokrat. —134 
186 On 11 March 1865, the Nordstern (No. 300) published a protest by Georg 
Herwegh, Friedrich Wilhelm Rüstow and Friedrich Reusche. It was against a 
report in Der Social-Demokrat, of 26 February 1865, which said that Lassalle was 
flirting with the Prussian monarchy. The authors of the protest asserted that 
Lassalle did not show any special respect for the King of Prussia and that the 
report's allegations were unfounded.—134 
187 In early March 1865 Carl Siebel forwarded to Engels a letter he received from 
the then editor of the Düsseldorfer Zeitung Dresemann. The latter invited Marx 
and Engels to contribute to the Sphinx, a newspaper which Friedrich Albert 
Lange intended to found in Duisburg. —136 
188 Marx criticised the Ricardian 'law of population' in the first volume of Capital 
(see the English edition published in 1887 under Engels' editorship: Part VII,

Delitzsch advocated harmony of capitalists' and workers' interests, asserting that

co-operatives could help improve workers' conditions under capitalism and save 
small producers and artisans from ruin.—138 
192 Bernhard Becker, President of the General Association of German Workers, 
made a speech at a meeting of the Association's Hamburg Section on 22 March 
1865 in which he slandered the International Working Men's Association and 
also Marx, Engels and Liebknecht. Marx rebuffed Becker in an article 'The 
"President of Mankind'", published in the Rheinische Zeitung, No. 102 (second 
supplement), 12 April and the Berliner Reform, No. 88 (supplement), 13 April 
1865 (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 92-96). On 27 March, Becker was 
denounced by Liebknecht at a meeting of the Association's Berlin Section when it 
discussed the question of the presidency. On 1 April 1865 the Nordstern (No. 303) 
printed statements by Riistow and Herwegh against the attacks made by Becker on 
Countess Hatzfeldt. 
In view of the growing discontent among the rank-and-file members of the 
General Association with Becker as President, the Berlin Section resolved to 
expel him. Many other sections followed suit. In June 1865 Becker was 
compelled provisionally to delegate his presidential powers to his deputy 
Fritzsche and completely renounced them in November.—139, 140, 566 
193 Lefort's statement about his withdrawal from the International was published in 
L'Association, No. 6, April 1865.—140 
194 At the Central Council meeting of 28 March 1865 the General Secretary, 
William Cremer, spoke on behalf of the Council's deputation (Eccarius, Weston, 
Jung, Fox, and others). He reported on the results of their meeting with the 
delegates of the National Shoemakers' Union and its adoption of the following 
resolution: 'That we cordially agree with the principles of the International 
Association as represented so eloquently by the deputation from that body and 
pledge ourselves to join them for the furtherance of those principles and 
endeavour to spread their liberal and glorious ideas among our constituents.'— 
140 
195 In his letters to Engels, dated 10 January and 1 April 1865, Sigismund 
Borkheim wrote that Adolph Kolatschek, an Austrian journalist, intended to 
resume publication of the Stimmen der Zeit and invited Marx and Engels to 
contribute to it. Kolatschek's intention did not materialise.—141 
196 The notice entitled 'A Correction' was published with slight changes in Der 
weiße Adler, No. 48, 22 April 1865 over Jung's signature (see present edition, 
Vol. 20, pp. 97-98).—143 
197 This letter has reached us as a draft in Marx's notebook for 1865. The 
notebook also reproduced the text attached to the letter of the Central Council 
official resolution of 11 April 1865, signed by Odger, the President, and 
Cremer, the General Secretary of the Council, appointing Marx Correspond­
ing Secretary for Belgium pro tern instead of Le Lubez who abandoned this 
post. The following postscript was entered in the notebook: 'Letter sent on 
Monday, 17 April 1865.'—144 
198 In his article 'Falsche Freunde und offene Feinde', published in the Nordstern, 
No. 304, on 8 April 1865, Friedrich Reusche defended Georg Herwegh, 
Friedrich Rüstow and Johann Philipp Becker whom Bernhard Becker called 
'false friends' for their refusal to co-operate on Der Social-Demokrat (see 
Note 173). Written in a melodramatic tone, the article refers to the oath given 
by the above-mentioned men to the dying Lassalle to bring his cause to a finish,

and calls Bernhard Becker, Schweitzer and their followers 'venal mercenaries and 
tools of reaction'. 
By mentioning Willich 's apple-tree Engels means the oath which Willich and 
his volunteer corps gave under an apple-tree during the Baden-Palatinate 
uprising in 1849; better die on German soil than go back into exile. However, as a 
result of the insurgents' defeat, Willich's corps was compelled to cross the Swiss 
frontier. Engels described this episode in his letter to Marx of 23 November 1853 
which Marx included in his pamphlet The Knight of the Noble Consciousness (see 
present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 489-93).—147 
199 The coopting of Pierre Vinçard, a working-class journalist and veteran of the 
1848 revolution, for the Paris Administration (which already included Fribourg, 
Limousin and Tolain) was meant to make the French members of the 
International familiar with the revolutionary and socialist traditions of the 
French working-class movement of the 1840s. However, Vinçard did not accept 
the appointment for personal reasons, about which he informed Dupont, the 
Corresponding Secretary of the Central Council for France, in a letter of 
30 April 1865.—149 
200 On Friedrich Lessner's proposition, the German Workers' Educational Society 
in London (see Note 150) at its meeting on 22 March 1865 broke with the 
Lassallcans. 
At the general meeting of the Society and its branches, Teutonia and 
Eintracht, called on 5 April 1865 to discuss the behaviour of Bernhard Becker, 
President of the General Association of German Workers, and the editorial 
board of Der Social-Demokrat, Louis Weber tried to defend the Lassallean 
leaders. He wanted to pass a resolution declaring the political position of some 
Party officials to be their personal affair that should not be discussed by 
members of the Society. Weber's proposition was turned down by the meeting. 
The report of this meeting was given in Der Social-Demokrat, No. 50, 21 April 
1865,  in a distorted way. 
Teutonia—an educational society of German workers who lived in the 
southern districts of London, a branch of the German Workers' Educational 
Society. Together with the latter, it joined the International Working Men's 
Association in January 1865. The leaders of the Teutonia were A. Klinker and 
Klinke.— 150, 174 
201 This refers to the 'Address of Germans to the American Nation' written on the 
occasion of the assassination of US President, Abraham Lincoln, on 14 April 
1865 and published in The Times, No.  25171,  28 April 1865.—151 
202 Engels is referring to the report from Solingen, published in the Nordstern, 
No. 307, 29 April 1865, on the meeting of the Solingen section of the General 
Association of German Workers. The section was in opposition to Bernhard 
Becker, President of the Association. Its members formed a community of their 
own and dissociated themselves from those sections which continued to 
recognise Becker's leadership. In opposition to Der Social-Demokrat edited by 
Schweitzer, they declared the Nordstern the official organ of the Association. In 
September 1865 the Solingen community constituted itself as a section of the 
International in Germany.— 152 
203 At the battle of Jena (14 October 1806) the French army, commanded by 
Napoleon, routed the Prussian army, thus forcing Prussia to surrender.—153,

204 According to a report from Cologne published in the Nordstern, No. 308, 
6 May 1865, the growing opposition to Bernhard Becker, President of the 
General Association of German Workers, compelled him to raise the question 
of confidence at the meeting of the Association's local branches in Cologne. 
The majority of the meeting walked out, and of the remaining 24 members 
only 15 voted for Becker.—154 
205 The Central Council of the International failed to acquire most of The Bee-Hive 
Newspaper shares through lack of funds and because at the decisive moment, in 
May 1865, its members were distracted by the campaign for electoral reform in 
England. On the eve of the shareholders' general meeting, Council members 
Odger, Cremer, and Howell left for Manchester to attend a conference of 
reformers, which allowed Potter to retain the majority of votes in his 
favour.—155,  169, 173 
206 us President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, an 
agent of Southern planters and New York bankers. Andrew Johnson became 
President. On 2 May 1865 the Central Council of the International took a 
decision to draw up an address to the American people. At the Council 
meeting of 9 May Marx read out the 'Address from the Working Men's 
International Association to President Johnson' which he had written. The 
Address was passed to President Johnson through Adams, the American envoy to 
England (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 99-100).—155 
207 After Marx, Engels, Liebknecht, Herwegh, Rüstow and Johann Philipp Becker 
refused to collaborate with Der Social-Demokrat, Moses Hess continued to work on 
it, and when the Rheinische Zeitung printed a notice about Hess' refusal to 
contribute to the newspaper, he denied it.—156, 158 
208 In its issue No. 58 (the literary section) of 10 May 1865, Der Social-Demokrat 
reprinted from the Allgemeine Zeitung (of 29 April 1865, supplement) a 
commentary on Wuttke's Städtebuch des Landes Posen. In this book Wuttke tried 
to prove that the Germans had an inherent right to the Polish lands.—156 
209 In his report from Paris published in the supplement to issue No. 57 of Der 
Social-Demokrat of 7 May 1865, Moses Hess again slandered the French 
members of the International (see notes 95 and 122).—157 
210 The national Reform Conference, sponsored by the liberal National Reform 
Union, was held in Manchester on 15 and 16 May 1865. Most of its delegates 
were representatives of the bourgeoisie. They refused to include the demand 
for universal manhood suffrage in the conference's resolutions as proposed by 
the International's Central Council member Cremer, who was supported by 
Ernest Jones and some delegates of the Reform League (see Note 155). 
Edmond Beales, President of the Reform League, and other radicals adopted 
an indecisive attitude to the nature of the reform. As a result, the conference 
carried a moderate resolution to extend the franchise to householders and 
house tenants who paid poor-rates. The report of the Manchester Conference 
was published in The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No. 188, 20 May 1865.—158 
211 Early in May 1865 the House of Commons turned down Baines' moderately 
liberal Bill which envisaged the reduction of the electoral qualification in the 
cities from £10 to £6. This reflected the sentiments of the British bourgeoisie 
which was scared by the scope of the reform movement among the workers. 
On 2 May 1865 the Executive Committee of the Reform League addressed a

manifesto to the British workers, calling on them to take part in the campaign 
for manhood suffrage.—158 
212 At the elections to the Geneva Cantonal Council in August 1864 the radical 
James Fazy, who headed the canton's government in 1846-53 and  1855-61, 
suffered a crushing defeat because of the exposure of his financial machina­
tions as President of the Banque Générale Suisse. After the elections Fazy's 
followers made an armed attack on some of those who voted against him. 
When Swiss government troops arrived in Geneva, Fazy had to flee to 
France.—158, 185, 237 
21S A reference to the correspondence between Le Lubez, the Corresponding 
Secretary of the Central Council of the International for France, and Henri 
Lefort, the International's correspondent in Neufchâteau, during the conflict in 
the Paris Section of the International (see Note 95). Le Lubez tried to set 
Lefort against the Central Council and the Paris Administration.—158 
214 From May to August 1865 the Central Council of the International discussed 
economic questions raised by John Weston. Apart from the speech made at the 
special Council meeting of 20 May 1865 whose minutes have not survived, 
Marx delivered a report on the subject at the Council meetings on 20 and 
27 June, known as 'Wages, Price and Profit'. This report was not printed in the 
lifetimes of Marx and Engels. It was first prepared for the press by Marx's 
daughter, Eleanor, and published with Edward Aveling's preface, as a 
pamphlet in London in 1898 under the title Value, Price and Profit. In the 
present edition of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels it is printed under 
this title (see Vol. 20, pp. 101-49).—160, 162 
215 A German translation of Marx's 'Address from the Working Men's Internation­
al Association to President Johnson' (see Note 206) was published in Chicago, 
Sonntags-Zeitung, 4 June 1865.—161 
216 A reference to the statements made by a number of branches of the General 
Association of German Workers against Bernhard Becker and published in the 
Nordstern, No. 313, 24 June 1865 (see Note  192).—161,  176 
217 The first Congress of the International Working Men's Association scheduled 
for 1865 in Brussels was held between 3 and 8 September 1866 in Geneva. The 
decision to postpone the Congress was taken by the Central Council on 25 July 
1865 on Marx's insistence. He considered that the local organisations of the 
International were not yet strong enough in ideological and organisational 
terms and suggested that a preliminary conference be held in London in 
September 1865. 
Official reasons for postponing the congress were set out in the 'Report of 
the Sub-Committee on the Questions of a Congress and Conference' drawn up 
by the Central Council's decision of 13 June 1865 and approved by the Council 
on 25 July (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 375-77).—163, 171, 174, 179 
218 In a letter written at the end of May-early June 1865, Liebknecht asked Marx 
whether he knew Dr Kugelmann from Hanover and supposed that Kugelmann 
was a friend of Pieper's and adhered to 'communism'. 
In the 1850s, while in exile in London, Pieper was a friend of Marx and 
Engels. From 1859 he lived in Bremen and late in February 1864 he visited 
Marx in London.—165 
219 Liebknecht's letter to Marx of 13 May 1865 contained a postscript from Paul 
Stumpf from Mainz who visited Berlin at the time. Stumpf wrote to Marx that 

=====第657页=====
Notes 619 
he had sent him a letter ten days ago through Bruhn from Hamburg, in which 
he asked Marx for his opinion on the disagreements between the Nordstern and 
Der Social-Demokrat, on the situation in the General Association of German 
Workers and the position of its President, Bernhard Becker. Stumpf also asked 
Marx about his latest works and those of Engels and whether he had received 
the letter.—165 
220 Marx here speaks ironically about the assertions in Liebknecht's letters that the 
International was widely supported in Germany.—165 
221 This refers to Countess Sophie von Hatzfeldt's lawsuit and to Ferdinand Lassalle's 
mother who challenged Lassalle's will.—165 
222 The Permissive Bill empowered parishes to grant licences for the sale of 
alcoholic beverages. From 1864 to 1877 it was repeatedly introduced in the 
British Parliament.—168 
223 In the 1850s Windmill Street, Soho, was the seat of the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London (see Note 150).—168 
224 A banquet of the opposition liberal majority of the Chamber of Deputies, 
organised by the Rhineland men of Progress (see Note 99) headed by the 
Town Councillor Classen-Kappelmann, was scheduled for 22-23 July 1865, in 
Cologne. On 17 July the Bismarck government forbade the banquet. Despite 
numerous protests on the part of the workers in the various towns of Germany 
against this arbitrary measure, most opposition members did not dare to show 
open resistance. Only some 80 delegates out of the 250 invited arrived in 
Cologne. The banquet's organiser, Classen-Kappelmann, fearing arrest, left for 
Belgium. Since the hall where the banquet was to take place had been closed by 
the police, the deputies tried to hold the banquet in the Zoological Gardens, 
but were driven out of it by soldiers and policemen.—169, 182, 185, 229 
225 xhe reference is to a series of banquets in favour of electoral reform that took 
place in France from July 1847 to January 1848 and became a prelude to the 
February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1848.—169 
226 Marx wrote this letter to Léon Fontaine after he had become acquainted with 
the state of affairs in Belgium from the letter of Charles Limousin, a French 
member of the International who visited Belgium, to Eugène Dupont, the 
Central Council's Corresponding Secretary for France, the letter being dated 
6 July 1865. In the summer of 1865, a group of Brussels workers discontent 
with Fontaine's inertness decided to set up a section of the International in 
Belgium. However, they met with Fontaine's resistance: he demanded that he 
should be acknowledged as the only representative of the Central Council of 
the International. On 17 July a Belgian Section was organised with the active 
participation of César De Paepe. It elected a provisional committee which 
established direct contacts with Marx and the Central Council. 
Marx's letter to Léon Fontaine has been preserved as a draft in Marx's 
notebook for 1865. 
The letter was first published in English in Karl Marx, On the First 
International. Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new translations by 
Saul K. Padover, New York, 1973.—170 
227 After the publication of Part One of A Contribution to the Critique of Political 
Economy in 1859, Marx wrote a voluminous economic manuscript in 1861-63 
which is a second, after the manuscript of 1857-58, detailed rough version of 
his future Capital. By 1863, Marx had finally decided to publish his work in 
22«

620 Notes 
four books: the first three books—theoretical, and the fourth—historical-
literary. Having completed the 1861-63 manuscript, in August 1863 Marx 
began preparing his Capital for the press. 
In the course of this work he wrote a third preparatory version of 
Capital—the Economic Manuscript of 1863-65 consisting of three theoretical 
books (the outline of the fourth book, Theories of Surplus Value, was in the 
1861-63 manuscript). Subsequendy, having finished them, Marx again returned 
to the first book. On Engels' advice he decided to publish it before the others 
were ready. Marx gave the finishing touches to it in 1866 and most of 1867. 
The first German edition of the first book—Volume One of Capital—appeared 
in September 1867. As agreed with Otto Meissner, a Hamburg publisher, the 
second and third books, devoted to the analysis of the process of circulation of 
capital and the forms of capitalist production as a whole, were to be published 
as Volume Two of Capital, and the fourth book, on the 'history of economic 
theories', as the concluding volume, Volume Three, of Capital. 
However, during his lifetime Marx did not manage to prepare the last 
books of Capital for the press. It was Engels who after Marx's death did this 
and published his manuscripts of the second and third books, as Volume Two 
(1885) and Volume Three (1894) of Capital. Engels also intended to publish the 
above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book, as Volume Four of Capital, 
but did not materialise this intention during his lifetime. In the present edition 
of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels, this book is included in the 
Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 (vols 30-34), while the first three volumes of 
Capital published in vols 35-37.—173, 227, 312 
228 By Jacob Grimm's method Marx means the method Jacob and his brother 
Wilhelm used in compiling their German Dictionary. It was published in 
instalments, beginning in 1832; each was prepared independently from one 
another.—173 
229 The English translation of Volume One of Capital by Samuel Moore and 
Edward Aveling, edited by Engels, was published after Marx's death, in 1887. 
Eleanor Marx-Aveling took an active part in preparing this edition.—173, 394, 
436, 499 
230 At the end of July 1865 John Bredford Leno, the proprietor of The Miner and 
Workman's Advocate published in London from 1863, proposed placing this 
weekly at the service of the Central Council of the International. The proposal 
met with approval by the Council members. They discussed the matter at the 
meetings of 8 and 15 August 1865, in the absence of Marx who was busy with 
his Capital. However, Eccarius informed him in detail about this in a letter 
dated 16 August 1865. 
On 22 August an inaugural meeting was held of shareholders of the 
joint-stock company for financing the workers' paper, which was called the 
Industrial Newspaper Company. The meeting, which Marx attended, approved 
the address to the working men of Great Britain and Ireland and the 
Company's Prospectus (both published in the present edition, Vol. 20). On 
25 September 1865 the London Conference of the International declared the 
newspaper, which in September assumed the name of The Workman's Advocate, 
an official organ of the International. At the beginning of November 1865 the 
paper became the full property of the Industrial Newspaper Company. Marx 
was a member of the Company's Board and remained on it until June 1866. 
However, the growing influence of reformist elements in the paper's Editorial 
Board and the vacillation and conciliatory policy of the trade union leaders on 

=====第659页=====
Notes 621 
the Company's Board did not allow Marx and his followers to prevent the 
transformation of this working-class paper into an organ supporting the 
bourgeoisie.—173, 201, 206, 571 
231 Marx is referring to a campaign of preparations for the Anglo-French 
industrial exhibition timed for the fiftieth anniversary of the peace treaty 
between Britain and France (1815) which was to open on 8 August 1865. At its 
meeting on 30 May 1865 the Central Council of the International censured this 
attempt to divert the workers from the political struggle and diminish the 
influence of the International.—174 
232 An aliens act was passed in Belgium as early as 1835 and was renewed every 
three years. Despite widespread protests by the Belgian press and the public, 
this law was renewed for the tenth time at the end of June 1865.—174 
233 Thg reference is to the terms of the 1865 agreement between Marx and the 
Hamburg publisher Otto Meissner on which Marx's Capital was to be printed. 
The text of the agreement was sent to Marx by Meissner in his letter of 
21 March 1865 (see Note 66). The date of the agreement was not indicated. As 
preliminarily agreed, the whole of Capital was to be printed simultaneous­
ly in two volumes, each not exceeding the agreed number of printed sheets 
(about 50). In 1867 Meissner agreed to change the terms: to print the entire 
work in three volumes, publishing them at different time and enlarging the size 
of each volume (see Marx's letter to Engels of 13 April 1865, this volume, 
p. 357). Meissner left it to Marx's discretion to decide how the manuscript was 
to be delivered to him: by instalments or as a whole. Marx could avail himself 
of the agreement only in two years, when he finished his work on Volume One 
of Capitals 175, 219, 226, 343, 351 
234 Influenced by Sophie von Hatzfeldt, Carl Schilling published the pamphlet Die 
Ausstossung des Präsidenten Bernhard Becker aus dem Allgemeinen Deutschen 
Arbeiter-Verein und der 'Social-Demokrat' (Berlin, 1865). It was a report of the 
meeting of the Berlin branch of the General Association of German Workers 
held on 27 and 30 March 1865. Liebknecht spoke at the meeting in defence of 
Marx against Becker's slanders. The report contained distortions which 
Wilhelm Liebknecht and other followers of Marx, Theodor Metzner and 
August Vogt, refuted in a statement of 22 June 1865 published in 
the Volks-Zeitung, No. 145, 24 June 1865 and in other newspapers.—176, 
180, 191 
235 In a letter to Marx, dated 15 July 1865, Liebknecht wrote that the local 
Printers' Association and the Berlin Journeymen's Association had organised a 
demonstration in his honour. The latter had invited him as an honorary guest 
to its annual celebration in the countryside. In connection with this, 
Liebknecht wrote to Marx that he thought all local worthwhile elements from 
among the working class were ready to follow him, as well as Marx himself and 
Engels.— 176 
236 During their stay in Brussels Marx, Engels and other members of the 
Communist League were persecuted by the Belgian government. Early in 
March 1848 Marx received a royal order deporting him from Belgium; he and 
his wife were immediately arrested by the Brussels police. Engels, too, was 
detained and evicted across the French frontier in early October 1848 (he 
had come to Belgium in order to hide from the Prussian authorities).—179,

237 On 18 July 1865 an agreement was concluded between the Bismarck 
government and the Board of the Cologne-Minden Railway Joint-Stock 
Company. It granted the Company's Board the right to buy up its shares which 
until then belonged to the government alone. This deal placed a considerable 
sum of money at the disposal of the Bismarck government. The agreement was 
to be ratified by the Prussian Provincial Diet, but on 28 August the 
shareholders' general meeting unanimously approved it without the Diet's 
ratification.—179, 182, 211, 285

239 On 4 August 1865 Siebold wrote to tell Marx that there was a Workers' Association 
in Copenhagen led by an MP, C. V. Rimestad. He advised him to establish ties 
with the association but warned that Rimestad was a Bonapartist. At the same 
time Siebold made it clear that he regretted Marx's quarrel with Karl 
Blind.—180, 182

241 Engels made a trip to Germany, Switzerland and Italy at the end of August and 
mid-September 1865.—182, 183, 190, 192 
242 Returning to Siebold's letter to Marx, Engels criticises his proposal to establish 
contacts with the Copenhagen Workers' Association (see Note 239). This 
Association was under the influence of the Danish liberal party (Eider-Danes) 
which advanced the slogan 'Denmark up to the Eider'. The Eider-Danes 
demanded that the Duchy of Schleswig, populated mainly by Germans and 
separated from other German regions by the Eider river, should be united with 
Denmark. Schleswig and Holstein were at the time when the letter was written 
under the joint rule of Prussia and Austria (see Note 9).—183 
243 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in The Letters of 
Karl Marx, selected and translated with explanatory notes and an introduction 
by Saul K. Padover, Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey,

banking for 1857-58 and criticised the theories of money and capital contained 
in them.—186 
246 The London Conference of the International Working Men's Association was held 
from 25 to 29 September 1865. It was convened on Marx's insistence, for he 
considered that the Association's sections were not yet strong enough to 
succeed in holding a general congress in 1865 as stipulated by the Provisional 
Rules.  The conference was attended by Central Council members and by 
delegates from the principal branches in France, Switzerland and Belgium. 
Wilhelm Liebknecht could not come to the conference, and Germany was 
represented by Karl Marx as the Corresponding Secretary of the Central 
Council for the country and Johann Philipp Becker who had credentials from 
the Solingen branch of the General Association of German Workers which was 
in opposition to the latter's Lassallean leadership.

and also delegates' reports on the situation in individual sections. The main 
point discussed was the agenda and the procedure for convening the 
forthcoming congress. It was decided to hold it in Geneva in May 1866 (later 
the Central Council postponed it until early September 1866). Though the 
Proudhonists demanded that the Polish question should be struck off the 
agenda of the Congress and that the right of any member of the Association to 
participate in it be recognised, the conference retained in the agenda the point 
of the restoration of Poland's independence and recognised only elected 
delegates as competent members of the Congress. Other proposals of the 
Council concerning the programme of the Congress were also approved. 
The London Conference of 1865 which was prepared and conducted under 
Marx's guidance played an important part in the formation and organisational 
shaping of the International.—189, 201, 214 
On 15 September 1865 Liebknecht wrote to Marx that he could not go to the 
London Conference of the International because of urgent matters and the 
removal of his family to Leipzig, but promised him to send a report on the 
working-class movement in Germany. This report was sent to Marx on 23 
September but Marx did not read it out at the conference because, he believed, 
it said too much about his personal services (see Marx's letter to Liebknecht of 
21 November 1865, this volume, pp. 201-03).—190 
The Nordstern of 19 August 1865 published Moses Hess' article 'Eine Warnung' 
('A Warning') in which he opposed the idea of reorganising the General 
Association of German Workers under the leadership of Johann Philipp 
Becker. In his Paris correspondence 'Der Kongress der "Internationalen 
Arbeiter-Association" vertagt' published in Der Social-Demokrat, No. 130, of 30 
August, Hess described the leaders of the International Association as 'some 
demagogues sitting at a safe distance from the firing line'.—190 
Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester from 20 October to early November 
1865.—193,  196, 201, 208, 214 
On 16 July 1865 Marx's aunt Esther Kosel, who lived in Frankfurt am Main, 
died intestate. Along with other close relatives Marx was entitled to receive part 
of her legacy. Dr Salomon Fuld, a Frankfurt lawyer, was in charge of this 
matter.—194 
The enclosed letter, dated 13 November 1865, was from Theodor Metzner, 
Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt, members of the Berlin branch of the General 
Association of German Workers. During Wilhelm Liebknecht's stay in Berlin all 
three came into close contact with him which they continued to maintain after 
his expulsion from Berlin. In their letter the Berlin workers who gravitated 
towards the International informed Marx about the working-class movement in 
Germany and the split in the General Association and asked Marx to come to 
Berlin to lead it.— 196, 197, 198, 201 
The mass Negro uprising in Jamaica, the British colony in the West Indies, 
took place in October 1865. It was caused by the severe exploitation of the 
Negroes by the colonists, though slavery had been abolished on the island in 
1833.  The uprising was brutally suppressed by the Governor of Jamaica, 
General Eyre. The atrocities perpetrated by Eyre caused public outrage in 
Britain, and the British government was compelled to dismiss him from his 
post.—197, 199, 205, 300

restored despite the amnesty granted to political refugees on 12 January 1861

255 T}je  French delegates' report on the London Conference of the International 
Working Men's Association held in 1865 (see Note 246) was published in 
L'Opinion national, 8 October, L'Avenir national 12 October, Le Siècle, 14 
October 1865 and in other French newspapers.—199 
256 The Workman's Advocate, No. 141, of 18 November 1865 printed Peter Fox's 
report of the Central Council meeting of 14 November 1865 (see The General 
Council of the First International. 1864-1866. The London Conference 1865. 
Minutes, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1961, pp. 138-41). At this meeting the 
Corresponding Secretary for France, Eugène Dupont, read out the preface to 
the French delegates' report of the London Conference published in Le Siècle 
on 14 October 1865. The author of the preface was Henri Martin, a French 
historian and member of the International. He highly appreciated the activities 
of the International, its first conference and the programme of the future 
congress, in particular its Point 9 demanding the 'reconstruction of Poland 
upon a democratic and socialist basis'. The French Proudhonists Henri Tolain 
and Ernest Fribourg opposed this point at the conference and after it, for they 
advocated the proletariat's abstention from political activity.—199, 202 
257 The mass eviction of the Irish from land and their emigration, caused by the 
transfer from small peasant renting to large-scale pasturing, led to the growing 
national liberation struggle in Ireland. As a result, the Fenian movement 
developed there in the 1850s and 1860s. 
The Fenians were Irish revolutionaries who named themselves after the 
'Féne' —a name of the ancient population of Ireland. Their first organisations 
appeared in the 1850s in the USA among the Irish immigrants and later in 
Ireland  itself.  The secret Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, as the organisation 
was known in the early 1860s, aimed at establishing an independent Irish 
republic by means of an armed uprising. The Fenians, who expressed the 
interests of the Irish peasantry (see Marx's letter to Engels of 30 November 
1867),  came chiefly from the urban petty bourgeoisie and intelligentsia and 
believed in conspiracy tactics. The British government attempted to suppress 
the Fenian movement by severe police reprisals. In September 1865 it arrested 
a number of Fenian leaders, among them Thomas Clarke Luby, John O'Leary, 
Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa and other editors of the banned newspaper The 
Irish People. They were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment (O'Donovan 
Rossa for life). The Central Council of the International organised a campaign 
in defence of the condemned prisoners.—199, 468, 516, 523 
258 -rne data mentioned in the letter were given by Marx in Chapter III of the 
first edition of Volume One of Capital, He specified these data in the second 
German edition of the volume.—199 
259 Included in this letter, the text of the programme of the Geneva Congress was 
drawn up by Marx and approved by the London Conference of the 
International (see Note 246). It was first published in G. Jaeck, Die 
Internationale, Leipzig, 1904.

1865.-200 
261 Marx is referring to Liebknecht's 'Report on the Working-Class Movement in 
Germany' drawn up for the London Conference of the International (see Note 
247).  The manuscript of the report preserved among Marx's papers was 
published in English for the first time in The General Council of the First

Publishers, Moscow, 1961, pp. 251-60.—201 
262 In a letter to Marx written in mid-November 1865 Liebknecht told him that a 
certain Quenstedt from Berlin intended to write to Marx and help him publish 
reviews of Capital in scientific journals.— 202 
263 In a letter to Marx of 8 October 1865 Lothar Bucher invited him to contribute 
to the official organ of the Prussian government. Marx's reply letter to Bücher 
has not been discovered. Later, in 1878, Marx wrote a special item, 'Herr 
Bucher', concerning this offer, and gave a rebuff to this agent of Bismarck's in 
another article, 'Reply to Bucher's "Declaration" ' (see present edition, Vol. 24).— 
202 
264 Kugelmann could not answer Marx's letter of 23 February 1865 (see this 
volume, pp. 101-05) until 20 December (see Marx's reply of 15 January 1866 in 
this volume, pp. 220-21).—203, 207 
265 On 25 November 1865 César De Paepe read a letter from Marx at a meeting of 
the Brussels Section of the International Association. (The Institute of 
Marxism-Leninism does not have the original of this letter at its disposal.) The 
Minutes of this meeting recorded only that part of the letter which enumerated 
the points of the programme of the Geneva Congress drawn up by Marx and 
approved by the London Conference of the International (see Note 246). The 
differences from the similar text cited by Marx in his letter to Jung of 20 
November (see this volume, p. 200) are possibly due to the inaccuracies in the 
record of the above-mentioned Minutes.— 203 
266 On 24 November 1865 Schweitzer was sentenced to one year's imprisonment 
for the political articles in Der Social-Demokrat. However, in May 1866 he was 
temporarily released for health reasons and amnestied after the Austro-
Prussian war of 1866.—205 
267 The mass meeting was held by the Reform League (see Note 155) in London, 
in St Martin's Hall, on 12 December 1865. 
The committee for preparing the meeting consisted of the following 
members of the Central Council of the International: George Odger, John 
B. Leno, John Longmaid, William Dell, William Stainsby, George Howell and 
Robert Hartwell. The majority of those present at the meeting were workers 
and trade union members. The meeting adopted a resolution demanding 
manhood suffrage.—207, 215, 221, 253

268 D^ Vorbote —an official monthly of the German sections of the International 
Working Men's Association—began to appear in Geneva from January 1866 
under the editorship of Johann Philipp Becker. On the whole, this 
monthly pursued the policy of the Central (General) Council of the 
International. It published documents of the International, reports on its 
congresses and information about the activities of its sections in different 
countries. Der Vorbote was widely circulated in Switzerland and Germany, while 
in Austria and Hungary it was distributed illegally. Also among its readers were 
German workers living in London, Paris, New York, Chicago and other cities. 
The journal ceased publication in December  1871.—  207 
269 In December 1865 and January 1866 France was the scene of student 
disorders. They were caused by the decision of the Paris Academy Council to 
expel students who took part in the International Students' Congress held in 
Liège (Belgium) at the end of October 1865. The congress was attended by 
students from many European countries, the most numerous delegation being 
from France (Paul Lafargue, Charles Longuet, Charles Victor Jaclard, and 
others). Most speakers at the congress expressed the revolutionary students' 
protest against the regime of the Second Empire.—208, 211, 215, 304, 308 
270 In December 1861 France started an armed intervention in Mexico, joindy with 
Britain and Spain, to overthrow the progressive government of Benito Juarez 
and turn the Mexican republic into a colony of European powers. The invaders 
also intended to use Mexican territory as a spring-board for intervening in the 
US Civil War on the side of the slaveholding Southern  States.  In the summer of 
1863 the French occupied the city of Mexico (Britain and Spain recalled their 
troops in April 1862 because of contradictions with France) and declared 
Mexico an empire with Napoleon Ill's henchman, the Archduke of Austria 
Maximilian, at its head. However, the Mexican people put up a stubborn 
resistance to the French colonialists and inflicted a heavy defeat on them. In 
March 1867 they were compelled to withdraw.—208, 211, 215, 338, 438 
271 This is presumably an extract appended to one of Marx's letters to Engels 
written at the end of 1865 or beginning of 1866.— 208 
272 The Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung No. 1, of 1 January 1866 printed Schulze-
Delitzsch's announcement about the publication of his new work, Die 
Abschaffung des geschäftlichen Risico durch Herrn Lassalle. Ein neues Capitel zum 
Deutschen Arbeiterkatechismus. Written in reply to Lassalle's Herr Bastiat-Schulze 
von Delitzsch, der ökonomische Julian, oder: Capital und Arbeit, it soon after 
appeared in Berlin.—211 
273 The French Section (branch) in London was founded in the autumn of 1865. 
Besides proletarian members like Eugène Dupont, Hermann Jung, Paul 
Lafargue and others, it included petty-bourgeois refugees like Victor Le Lubez 
and, later, Félix Pyat. On 7 July 1868 the General Council of the International 
adopted a resolution, on Marx's proposal, condemning the provocative 
behaviour of Félix Pyat (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 7). After this a split 
occurred in the section: the proletarian elements left it and it actually lost ties 
with the International.—213, 214, 216 
274 On 16 and 18 December 1865 the Belgian democratic newspaper L'Echo de 
Verviers, Nos. 293 and 294, published an anonymous article which slandered 
the Central Council's activities and the work of the London Conference of the 
International held in 1865 (see Note 246). Its author was the French 
petty-bourgeois republican Pierre Vésinier, a refugee in Belgium and the 

=====第665页=====
Notes 627 
spokesman for petty-bourgeois elements in the French Section in London who 
opposed Marx and the Central Council. 
Vésinier's article was discussed in the Central Council on 26 December 1865 
and on 2 and 9 January 1866. On the instructions of the Council, Vésinier's 
slanderous attacks were refuted by Hermann Jung, who with Marx's help wrote 
a letter to L'Echo de Verviers. By the Council's decision of 6 February 1866 the 
letter was sent to the editor (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 392-400).—213, 
214, 216, 250 
275 The draft of the new statutes drawn up by Le Lubez was published in L'Echo de 
Verviers, No. 301, on 27 December 1865. This draft expressed the federalist 
views of some petty-bourgeois democrats, members of the French Section in 
London, and nullified the leading role of the Central Council by turning it into 
a mere representative body with purely technical informative and statistical 
functions.—213,  214 
276 Marx is referring to a series of articles against Poland by Proudhonist Hector 
Denis published in the Belgian newspaper La Tribune du Peuple in March-June 
1864 under the heading La question polonaise et la démocratie 
At Marx's request, between the end of January and early April 1866 Engels 
wrote a series of articles, entided What Have the Working Classes to Do with 
Poland},  in which he substantiated the International's stand on the nationalities 
question and criticised the Proudhonists' national nihilism and the Bonapartists' 
profiteering by the so-called principle of nationalities (see present edition, 
Vol. 20, pp. 152-61).—213 
277 Marx refers to Johann Philipp Becker's address, 'Rundschreiben der deutschen 
Abtheilung des Zentral Komites der Internationalen Arbeiterassociation für die 
Schweiz an die Arbeiter', issued in Geneva in November 1865. In it Becker 
urged the workers to join the International and wrote about the forthcoming 
publication of its German (Der Vorbote) and French (Journal de l'Association 
Internationale des Travailleurs) press organs. 
An English translation of some passages from this address was published in 
The Workman's Advocate, No. 145, 16 December 1865. 
A report of the International's activities in Switzerland was printed in issue 
No. 1 of Der Vorbote in January 1866 under the heading 'Entwicklungsgang 
unserer Association'. 
The note to Becker mentioned by Marx has not been found.—214 
278 From November 1865 the Central Committee of the German sections in 
Switzerland, headed by Johann Philipp Becker, served as the organising centre 
for sections uniting the German workers not only in Switzerland but also in 
Germany, Austria and in other countries where German refugee workers 
lived.—215,  219 
279 On 27 October 1865 in Port-au-Prince in Martinique (the French colony in the 
West Indies) three Zouave regiments refused to obey the French command to 
join the intervention in Mexico.— 215 
280 In 1865 the French government attempted to make the British government 
extend the Franco-British extradition treaty of 1843 (see Note 500) to persons 
guilty of political crimes.— 215 
281 On 2 January 1866, Austrian journalist Arnold Hilberg from Vienna wrote to 
Marx inviting him to contribute to the planned journal Internationale Revue. 
Marx's reply to him has not been found, but from Hilberg's next letter to

628 Notes 
Marx, of 18 January, it is clear that Marx agreed (see also Marx's letter to 
Engels of 14 February in this volume, p. 229). However, his work in the 
International and on Capital presumably prevented Marx from materialising 
his intention.—216, 229 
282 Marx's letter to Sigfrid Meyer of 15 January 1866 has not been found. It was 
written in reply to one from Theodor Metzner, Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt 
(see Note 251).—216, 220, 222 
283 This refers to Point 9 on the agenda of the London Conference of the 
International in 1865 which reads as follows: 'The Muscovite invasion of 
Europe, and the re-establishment of an integral and independent Poland' (see 
The General Council of the First International. 1864-1866. The London Conference 
1865. Minutes, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1961, p. 305).—216 
284 Yhe meeting to commemorate the third anniversary of the Polish insurrection 
of 1863-64 (see Note 24) was held in St. Martin's Hall, London, on 22 January 
1866 and was presided over by a Polish democrat, Ludwik Oborski. As 
reported by Glos Wolny, the organ of the democratic wing of Polish emigrants, 
the meeting was sponsored by the International Working Men's Association and 
the Polish emigrants. It unanimously adopted Fox's resolution, which was 
supported by Marx, expressing solidarity of the workers and democrats of 
Britain and other European countries with the Polish national liberation 
struggle. 
The report of the meeting was published in The Workman's Advocate, 
No. 151, 27 January, Glos Wolny, No. 93, 31 January, and The Bee-Hive 
Newspaper, No. 225, 3 February 1866.—218 
285 Marx presumably refers to L'Anti-Proudhon, a book by Denis (de Chateaugiron), 
that appeared in Rennes in 1860. From the Catholic standpoint Denis 
polemises over Proudhon's views set forth in his three-volume work De la Justice 
dans le Révolution et dans l'Église, Paris, 1858.—218 
286 Tne London Conference of the International Association (see Note 246) 
decided to hold the first congress of the International in Geneva in May 1866. 
Later, however, the Central Council found it necessary to postpone the 
congress. All sections of the International agreed with this decision, except for 
the Paris Section whose Proudhonist leaders wanted to hold the congress as 
soon as possible because they calculated to impose their programme and 
principles on it. The congress met on 3-8 September 1866.—220, 258, 271, 574 
287 In his letter to Marx of 20 December 1865 Ludwig Kugelmann asked him to 
send two membership cards of the International Association for himself and 
Theodor Heinrich Menke, and enclosed two talers for the purpose.—220 
288 Marx's letter addressed to August Vogt, and presumably also meant for Sigfrid 
Meyer and Theodor Metzner, has not been found.—222 
289 See this note by Marx in the English edition of Volume One of Capital 
published in London, under Engels' editorship, in 1887 (Part III, Chapter X, 
Section 2, p. 223). 
In the first German edition of Volume One of Capital (1867), the section 
'The Working Day' was part of Chapter III while in the second and subsequent 
German editions it made up Chapter VIII of Part III. In the English edition of 
1887 it is Chapter X in Part III (see present edition, Vol. 35).—224

Notes 629 
290 'Yhe Workman's Advocate (see Note 230) was renamed The Commonwealth on 10 
February 1866. Despite the reorganisation the newspaper remained the official 
organ of the International Working Men's Association. It continued to publish 
reports of the Central Council meetings and other documents of the 
International. Marx remained on the Board of the Industrial Newspaper 
Company which owned the paper until 9 June 1866. Thanks to his efforts 
Eccarius, who became the editor of The Workman's Advocate not long before, 
retained his post. However, the reformist leaders of trade unions managed to 
paralyse the influence of Marx's supporters. In April 1866 George Odger was 
appointed its editor-in-chief. In issue No. 183, 8 September 1866, the 
newspaper declared itself to be the organ of the Reform League (see Note 155) 
and in fact fell under the influence of the radical bourgeoisie. It ceased 
publication on 20 July 1867.—224, 249, 252, 262, 283, 290, 574 
291 In his letter of 18 January 1866 to Marx Wilhelm Liebknecht wrote that J. B. 
von Hofstetten, an editor of Der Social-Demokrat, had made one more attempt 
to persuade Marx, Engels and himself to contribute to the newspaper and use 
it for propagating the ideas of the International.—225 
292 On 29 January 1866 the Prussian Supreme Tribunal adopted a decision to 
institute court proceedings against Karl Twesten and Frenzel, members of the 
Chamber of Deputies, for their Chamber speeches delivered in 1865 in which 
they criticised the government press. 
This decision was adopted despite the fact that the courts of first and 
second instance rejected the prosecutor's demand to apply this measure to the 
said deputies. The Chamber of Deputies of the Prussian Provincial Diet found 
the Supreme Tribunal's decision contradictory to the Prussian Constitution and 
to the principle of the inviolability of deputies, and turned it down. 
Nevertheless, Twesten's case was referred to the Berlin City Court, but in 
May 1866 Twesten was acquitted.—226 
293 Engels refers to the negotiations between the Austrian ruling circles and the 
Hungarian moderate bourgeois-landlord opposition headed by Ferencz Deäk 
on the reorganisation of the Habsburg Empire's state structure. In the spring 
of 1867 an Austro-Hungarian agreement was concluded under which the 
Austrian Empire turned into the dual state of Austria-Hungary. 
This compromise between the ruling classes of the two countries aimed at 
suppressing the national liberation movement of the other peoples in the 
Empire, above all the Slavs. The concessions made to the Hungarians were also 
due to Austria's defeat in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866.—226, 297 
294 Marx set forth the theory of ground rent in Chapter VI of the manuscript of 
Book III of Capital. In the third volume of Capital published by Engels it 
is given as Part VI: 'Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground Rent' 
(see present edition, Vol. 37).—227 
296 Marx presumably meant H. Mahon's Aus dem Bericht an den Minister für die 
landwirtschaftlichen Angelegenheiten in Berlin über die japanische Landwirtschaft. 
This work was published as a supplement to J. Liebig's Die Chemie in ihrer 
Anwendung auf Agricultur und  Physiologie,  Braunschweig, 1862. Marx's notebook 
of excerpts for 1865, which he probably filled in while working on his 
Economic Manuscript of 1863-65, contains synopses of these two works. 
When developing the theory of ground rent Marx used, besides the 
above-mentioned work by Liebig, the following books: L. de Lavergne, The 
Rural Economy of England, Scotland and  Ireland.  Translated from the French,

296 The shifting system or Relay system was used by the British manufacturers to 
circumvent the laws limiting the working hours of children and juveniles. 
Under this system the children and juveniles, after several hours' work, were 
moved the same day to another workshop or factory in order to deceive the 
factory inspectors. As a result, their entire working day was often even longer 
than before the adoption of the ten hours act (see present edition, 
Vol. 35).—227 
297 xhe reference is to Section IV of Chapter IV of the first edition of Volume 
One of Marx's Capital. In the second and subsequent editions it is given as 
Chapter XIII: 'Machinery and Industry'. In the English edition of 1887 edited 
by Engels it is Chapter XV in Part IV (see present edition, Vol. 35).—228 
298 By decision of the Central Council of the International, The Workman's 
Advocate (No. 148) of 6 January 1866 reprinted from The Cork Daily Herald an 
appeal by the wives of the Irish revolutionaries O'Donovan Rossa and Luby to 
collect funds for the imprisoned Fenians (see Note 257). It was entitled 'The 
State Prisoners. An Appeal to the Women of Ireland'. 
At the Central Council meeting of 16 January 1866 Marx announced that 
Fox had received a letter from Mrs O'Donovan Rossa thanking him for the 
reprint of the appeal and for his articles published in The Workman's Advocate 
on 14, 21 and 28 October 1865: 'The British Coup d'État in Ireland' (No. 136), 
'The Influence of Irish National Feeling upon the Relations between Great 
Britain and the United States' (No. 137), and 'The Irish Difficulty. Continued' 
(No.  138).—228 
299 During the Prussian Provincial Diet's session in January and February 1866, the 
Party-of-Progress majority in the Chamber of Deputies opposed the Bismarck 
government on many issues. For instance, the Chamber voted down the 
decision of the Supreme Tribunal on the prosecution of the deputies Karl 
Twesten and Frenzel (see Note 292), opposed the annexation of the duchy of 
Lauenburg by Prussia without the approval of both Chambers and denounced 
the prohibition of the banquet in Cologne (see Note 224). The Chamber's 
commissions opposed the increase of the military budget for 1866 and the 
agreement between the government and the Cologne-Minden Railway Joint-
Stock Company (see Note 237). 
Following these actions, the Prussian government ordered that the session 
be closed down ahead of time on 23 February 1866 and on 9 May 1866 it 
disbanded the Provisional Diet.—229

Cologne-Minden Railway Joint-Stock Company (see Note 237) was discussed by 
a Commission of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 21 February 1866 and 
declared to be 'unconstitutional and invalid'. Due to its dissolution ahead of 
time (see Note 299), the Chamber was unable to consider the issue. Soon after 
that a statement appeared allegedly issued by the Board, which cancelled the 
agreement. On 28 February 1866, however, the Board officially denounced this 
as a rumour.— 236 
305 -phe full text of Engels' letter to Freiligrath cited below has not been found. 
Like the letter to Marx, it may have been written on about 10 March 1866 as a 
reply to Freiligrath's letter to Engels of 8 March 1866. In his letter Freiligrath 
expressed his anxiety about Marx's health, undermined by systematic night 
work, and wrote that a long rest in the countryside would restore his 
strength.—237 
306 The Central (General) Council's meetings took place in the premises at 18 
Bouverie Street, Fleet Street, from January 1866 to 25 June 1867.—238 
307 From 15 March to approximately 10 April 1866 Marx stayed in Margate where 
he took treatment and had a rest.—239, 261, 268, 283, 574 
308 The reference is to the heated debates, which started on 6 February 1866 at 
the British Parliament session over the bill on compensation to the cattle-
owners in the event of epizootic disease. The debates ended on 20 February 
with the adoption of the corresponding Act.—242, 245 
309 The Italian patriot Felice Orsini was executed in March 1858 for organising an 
attempt on Napoleon Ill's life. After Orsini's arrest, the leadership of the 
Carbonari a secret revolutionary society, which Louis Bonaparte joined in 1831 
when in Italy, sent him letters reminding him of his oath, which he had 
broken, to struggle for Italy's liberation. After Orsini's execution, it passed an 
official death sentence on Napoleon III.—242 
310 A. Rogeard, Les propos de Labienus —a pamphlet published in 1865; it criticised 
Napoleon Ill's empire under the guise of Julius Caesar's dictatorship in 
Rome.—243 
311 At the Central Council meeting of 13 March 1866, Cesare Orsini refuted Luigi 
Wolff's statement made at the Council meeting of 6 March that there were no 
Socialists in Italy in the French sense of the word; he also noted Mazzini's 
reactionary attitude towards science.—243 
312 A member of the Dutch Section of the International, Antoinette Philips in her 
letters gave an extensive account of the events in Holland, which is why Marx 
jokingly calls her his Dutch secretary.—243 
313 Marx and many of his supporters were unable to attend the Central Council 
meeting of 6 March 1866. Taking advantage of this, Le Lubez and L.  Wolff, 
supported by the English trade unionists Odger, Howell, Cremer and others, 
had a resolution passed on the response by the Central Council to a slanderous

article by Vésinier published in L'Echo de Verniers (see Note 274). The 
resolution stated that the Central Council withdrew on everything that had 
been said with regard to 'an eminent writer of the Latin race', i.e. Mazzini, and 
his followers. By this the refutation of Vésinier's statement that Mazzini was the 
author of the International's programme documents, specifically the Rules, was 
disavowed. As a result of the stand taken by Marx and his supporters, the 
resolution was withdrawn at the meeting of 13 March. Thus the claims of the 
petty-bourgeois elements to the leadership in the International were rebuffed. 
(For details of this episode see Marx's letter to Engels of 24 March 1866, this 
volume, pp. 249-50).—244, 251, 286 
314 A pun on the similarity of the names Grach and Gracchi—the name of the 
ancient Roman reformers. Marx's wife Jenny deposited 1,300 talers with 
Grach, a banker in Trier, who went bankrupt and concealed the fact from 
the depositors. At the request of Grach's wife, who promised to return the 
money after she had received an inheritance, Jenny Marx refrained from 
pursuing the matter in the courts (see Marx's letter to Engels of 8 March 1855, 
present edition, Vol. 39, p. 526). In Marx's subsequent letters, however, there 
is no indication whether the banker's wife paid the debt or not. Marx may be 
referring here to reassuring news about this matter.—244 
315 From the beginning of 1866, the Electoral Reform Movement in Britain came 
under the influence of moderate bourgeois elements; the reformist trade union 
leaders (Odger, Cremer and others) showed themselves increasingly willing to 
make concessions to them. Thus, at the National Conference held by the 
Reform League on 28 February-1 March 1866 in St Martin's Hall, London, 
they opposed the Central Council delegation (Fox, Carter, Jung, Lessner and 
others), which supported manhood suffrage, and announced that they would 
be quite satisfied with household suffrage as an immediate aim. 
On 12 March 1866 the Russell-Gladstone liberal government submitted to 
the House of Commons a Reform Bill providing for lower property 
qualifications for the electors (£10 in the counties and £7 in the towns). This 
would have meant a certain numerical increase of electors and included the 
wealthier strata of the working class as well. Under the influence of the 
bourgeois radicals and conciliatory-minded trade union leaders, the Reform 
League's Council supported, at its meetings of 16 and 20 March 1866, this 
extremely moderate bill of Gladstone which, however, was strongly opposed by 
the Tories and some Liberals and rejected by the Commons.—253, 257, 314 
316 In the spring of 1866 the conflict between Prussia and Austria sharpened over 
their joint possession of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The Bismarck 
government regarded Austria as its main rival in the struggle for hegemony in 
Germany and sought for a casus belli. With this aim in view it accused Austria, 
which ruled Holstein, of encouraging the anti-Prussian movement there. Austria 
rejected Prussia's accusations and on 16 March 1866 sent a circular dispatch to 
several member states of the German Confederation (a union of 
German states founded by the Vienna Congress in 1815) asking for their 
mediation in the conflict or military assistance against Prussia. Prussia in its 
turn also sought the support of the German Confederation. In its circular 
dispatch of 24 March 1866 to the German states, the Prussian government 
proposed a reform of the political and military institutions of the German 
Confederation. Bismarck demagogically proposed that this reform be carried 
out through a German parliament elected on the basis of universal 
suffrage.—254, 257, 258, 263, 264

317 A meeting between the Prime Minister of Prussia, Manteuffel, and the Austrian 
Prime Minister, Schwarzenberg, took place in Olmiitz (Olomouc) on 29 
November 1850. Under the pressure of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, 
Prussia had to give up her claims to take part in suppressing the uprising in the 
Electorate of Hesse in favour of Austria and in general, to abstain from 
attempts to establish her hegemony in Germany.—254 
318 \ reference to Alexander Cuza's abdication in February 1866. Cuza was 
Hospodar of Moldavia and Wallachia, which united in 1862 into the single 
Romanian state. The coup d'état was approved of by Russia and France, and 
was supported by Prussia. The boyar-bourgeois coalition, which was dissatisfied 
with the progressive reforms introduced by Cuza, invited Prince Charles 
Hohenzollern-Sigmarinen, a relative of the Prussian King, to the throne in 
March 1866. The new hospodar soon began to pursue a policy of subjecting 
Romania to the economic and political interests of Germany.—256, 258 
319 A reference to the pamphlet Congrès ouvrier. Association Internationale des 
Travailleurs published by the Paris Section of the International early in 1866. It 
contained a French translation of the International's Provisional Rules, with 
some passages distorted by the Proudhonists; an appeal of the Paris Section to 
the members of the International Association which had first been published in 
the summer of 1865 and which included the Section's programme for the 
congress initially intended to be held in Brussels; the French delegation's report 
about the London Conference of 1865; the programme for the Geneva 
Congress of 1866, which had been approved by the London Conference, and 
other material.—259 
320 The Thirty Years' War, 1618-48—a European war, in which the Pope, the 
Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs and the German Catholic princes rallied 
under the banner of Catholicism and fought against Protestant countries: 
Bohemia, Denmark, Sweden, the Republic of the Netherlands, and a number 
of German states. The rulers of Catholic France, rivals of the Habsburgs, 
supported the Protestant camp.—263 
321 A reference to the circular dispatch of 16 March 1866 sent by the Austrian 
government (see Note 316). 
On 9 April 1866, the Prussian government submitted to the Federal Diet a 
proposal that an all-German parliament be convened through universal 
suffrage in order to decide the question of reforming the German Confedera­
tion.—264, 266, 285 
322 The Kingdom of Poland—the Polish territory annexed to the Russian Empire in 
accordance with the decision of the Vienna Congress of 1815.—267 
323 The Vienna Treaty, which concluded the war of 1864 waged by Prussia and 
Austria against Denmark (see Note 9), confirmed a number of previous treaties 
and conventions on Denmark, Schleswig and Holstein, in particular the clauses 
of the London Protocol of May 1852 on the Danish succession. In the 
Protocol, the Emperor of Russia was named as one of the lawful claimants 
to the Danish throne (being a descendant of Charles Peter Ulrich, Duke of 
Holstein-Gottorp, who reigned in Russia as Peter III). The claimants waived 
their rights in favour of Duke Christian of Glücksburg, who was named heir to 
King Frederick VII. This created a precedent for the claims of the Russian 
Emperor to the Danish throne in the event of the extinction of the Glücksburg 
dynasty.— 267

F. Engels, The Civil War in France, London, 1937.—268 
325 In March 1866, London tailors demanded a wage increase. A number of 
owners of large tailors' shops responded with a lock-out. On 27 March, all 
London tailors went on strike. The Executive Committee of the Journeymen 
Tailors' Protective Association, which had been formed at the national 
conference of British tailors held in Manchester on 12-17 March 1866, 
appealed to all tailors in Britain to support the strike. At its meeting of 27 
March 1866, the Central Council of the International decided to instruct the 
Continental corresponding secretaries to call upon the tailors on the Continent 
not to go to Britain, where the employers were going to use them as 
strike-breakers. The Central Council's support of the strike played an 
important part in the victory of the London tailors in April 1866 and added to 
the popularity and prestige of the International Working Men's Association 
among the British working class. On 17 April, the Tailors' Protective 
Association joined the International.—268 
326 xhis is a reference to the resistance with which Russell-Gladstone Reform Bill 
(see Note 315) was met by the Conservatives and some Liberals. Marx calls the 
Right-wing Liberals, who were once headed by Lord Palmerston, Palmerstonian 
Whigs. In 1866, they were nicknamed the Adullamites by John Bright as an 
allusion to the biblical legend about David's persecution by King Saul and his 
refuge in the cave of Adullam. The nickname became a synonym for 
dissatisfaction with everything and was used to condemn the Right-wing 
Liberals for their opposition to the Reform Bill.—269, 270 
327 On 26 March 1866, Edinburgh tailors went on strike. With a view to preventing 
the importation into Scotland of German and Danish tailors to be used as 
strike-breakers, German tailors living in London formed a committee headed 
by Lessner and Haufe, and decided to act jointly with the Central Council of 
the International. At Marx's request, Lessner and Haufe sent him on 3 May 
details about the events in Edinburgh for use in a report for the German press. 
On 4 May, Marx wrote and sent Liebknecht, on behalf of the Central Council, 
a short article, entitled 'A Warning', which was published in several German 
papers (see present edition, Vol. 20). At the same time a leaflet written by 
Lessner and Haufe was issued in London. They appealed to the German 
workers in London to raise funds and support the strikers. Moreover, the 
Central Council sent Haufe and Hansen to Edinburgh to wreck the employers' 
plans.  The Central Council's efforts contributed to the success of the strike, and 
promoted the International's influence in Britain.—  270,  272, 275 
328 A reference to the steps taken by Bismarck to find allies in the war with Austria 
that he was preparing. On 8 April 1866, Prussia and Italy signed a secret treaty 
under which they were to join in a war against Austria until Italy received 
Venetia and Prussia equivalent territories in Germany.— 270, 282, 288 
329 On the London tailors' strike see Note 325. 
On 23 April 1866, the London wire-workers went on strike, demanding a 
10 per cent wage increase. The same day, the strike committee sent out letters 
to all towns in England, Scotland and Ireland requesting the wire-workers there 
not to take jobs in London during the strike. With the help of the Central 
Council of the International, similar letters were sent to France and Germany. 
At the Central Council meeting of 24 April 1866, B. Patis, a member of the

London Association of Wire-Workers, thanked the Council for its help to the 
strikers and promised that the wire-workers would join the International.—272 
330 On 7 May 1866, Ferdinand Cohen, a student and Karl Blind's stepson, made 
an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Bismarck. He was arrested and 
committed suicide in prison.—273, 275 
331 A reference to Austria's defeat by France and Piedmont in the Austro-Franco-
Italian war of 1859.—274 
332 In preparing a war against Austria, Bismarck's government sought for France's 
benevolent neutrality. On 6 May 1866, the Emperor Napoleon III made a 
speech at an agricultural festival in Auxerre, in which he said that, like the 
majority of the French nation, he felt an aversion for the treaties of 1815, 
which certain parties would like to make the only foundation of France's 
foreign policy (see The Times, No. 25492, 8 May 1866). This statement, which 
was a response to a critical speech made by Louis Adolphe Thiers in the Corps 
législatif,  implied the demand that the clauses of the Vienna treaties concerning 
France's eastern borders be revised. In Prussia, it was regarded as an 
encouragement for Bismarck's intention to reorganise the German Confedera­
tion which had been formed on the basis of the decisions of the Vienna 
Congress of 1815.—274 
333 On Bismarck's intended reform of the German Confederation, see Note 316. 
The Fundamental Rights of the German People (Die Grundrechte des 
deutschen Volkes), approved by the Frankfurt National Assembly late in 1848, 
formulated, like the Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen, the basic 
bourgeois freedoms; they were incorporated into the Imperial Constitution of 
1849,  which was worked out by the National Assembly, but rejected by the 
King of Prussia and other German sovereigns (see Note 130). The main points 
of the Fundamental Rights were included in the constitutions of some German 
states,  but were later on either deleted from them, or revised and curtailed on 
the basis of the decision of the Federal Diet of 23 August  1851.—  276 
334 Engels' series of articles, 'What Have the Working Classes to Do with Poland?', 
was never finished. This may have been because of the increasing influence of 
the radical bourgeois on the editorial board of The Commonwealth, where it was 
being published.—278, 280 
338 At the Central Council meeting of 8 May 1866, Peter Fox announced that, at 
the next meeting, he would speak against a passage in Engels' third article 
('The Doctrine of Nationality Applied to Poland') from the series 'What Have 
the Working Classes to Do with Poland?' (present edition, Vol. 20). Judging by 
this letter of Marx's, Fox made a speech at the Central Council meeting of 15 
May 1866; however, there are no records, in the minutes of this meeting, either 
of Fox's speech or of Marx's reply.— 278 
33B Marx uses the term Haupt- und Staatsaktionen ('principal and spectacular 
actions'), which has several meanings. In the seventeenth and the first half of 
the eighteenth century, it denoted plays performed by German touring 
companies. The plays, which were rather formless, presented tragic historical 
events in a bombastic and at the same time coarse and farcial way. 
Secondly, this term can denote major political events. It was used in this 
sense by a trend in German historical science known as 'objective historio­
graphy'. Leopold Ranke was one of its chief representatives. He regarded 
Haupt- und Staatsaktionen as the main subject-matter of history.— 280

337 The Commonwealth, No. 165 of 5 May 1866, carried an editorial statement to the 
effect that the editors bore no responsibility for the contributions printed below 
a certain line. The responsibility was to be borne by the authors themselves. 
The statement was directed primarily against Engels' series of articles 'What 
Have the Working Classes to Do with Poland?', which were printed below the 
line marked by the editors.—280 
338 The crash of Barnett's bank in Liverpool was one of the first signs of the crisis 
of 1866 which led to the collapse of the leading houses of Overend, Gurney, 
and following this of other banks, including the Consolidated Bank.— 281 
339 No. 15 of Le Courrier français for 20 May 1866 carried an appeal of the Paris 
students to the students of Germany and Italy (Aux étudiants des universités 
d'Allemagne et d'Italie, les étudiants de Paris) in connection with the threat of war 
between Prussia and Austria. This appeal was strongly influenced by 
Proudhonists who ignored the historic tasks of the national unification of 
Gennany and Italy. The meeting of the Central Council, which was held on 5 
June 1866 in Marx's absence, discussed the appeal of the French Section in 
London in response to the appeal of the Paris students: 'To the Paris Students, 
to the Students and Young People of All Countries from the Workers of All 
Countries' (The General Council of the First International. 1864-1866. The London 
Conference 1865. Minutes, Moscow, 1961, pp. 337-39). Marx was dissatisfied with 
the content of the latter appeal. At the Central Council meeting of 19 June 
1866,  Marx gave an extensive criticism of the Proudhonist position on the 
nationalities question (see this volume, pp. 286-87).—281 
340 A reference to the unsuccessful attempt on Alexander II's life made by the 
Russian revolutionary Dmitri Karakosoff on 4 April 1866.—282 
341 An allusion to Bismarck's well-known expression about the unification of 
Germany by 'blood and iron'. He said at a sitting of the budget commission of 
the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in September 1862: 'The great questions of 
time are decided not by speeches and majority decisions—this was the mistake 
of 1848 and 1849—but by iron and blood'.—282 
342 At a session of the Commons on 4 June 1866, Disraeli criticised Clarendon's 
activity as Foreign Secretary, in particular, his alleged lack of firmness during 
the Crimean war and at the Paris peace congress of 1856.—282 
343 Engels is referring to Prussia's defeat in the war with Napoleonic France in 
1806.—285

345 Xhis is a reference to Engels' intention to write articles for The Manchester 
Guardian on the Austro-Prussian war, which broke out in June 1866. He wrote 
a series of five articles, and they were published in the newspaper under the 
heading 'Notes on the War in Germany' (see present edition, Vol. 20). 
The Austro-Prussian war of 1866 put an end to the rivalry between Austria 
and Prussia, which had lasted for many years, and predetermined the 
unification of Germany under the supremacy of Prussia. Several German states 
(such as Hanover, Saxony, Bavaria, and Württemberg) fought on Austria's side.

Prussia formed an alliance with Italy. In June and July, hostilities were 
conducted on two fronts: in Bohemia and in Italy. After the grave defeat of 
her army at Sadowa, Austria began peace negotiations and signed a peace 
treaty in Prague on 23 August.—286, 290, 296, 298 
346 A discussion on the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 took place at the Central 
Council meetings of 19 and 26 June, and 17 July 1866. 
It was Marx's aim in the discussion to explain the necessity for the 
International to take an independent stand as a working-class organisation. 
This stand should have nothing to do either with the Proudhonists' nihilistic 
attitude towards the struggle for the national unification of Germany and Italy 
or with the British trade unionist tendency to embellish the unification policy of 
the ruling classes in Prussia and Italy, to neglect their expansionist and dynastic 
motives which played an important part in initiating the war conflict. Marx's 
critical speech persuaded the Central Council to refuse, on 17 July, to vote for 
the resolutions submitted earlier by Cremer and Dutton, as well as for Fox's 
resolution, because they failed to give precise formulations of the tasks of the 
proletariat. The Council unanimously adopted, with certain amendments, the 
following resolution which had been proposed by Bobczynski and Carter: 
'That the Central Council of the International Working Men's Association 
consider the present conflict on the Continent to be one between Governments 
and advise working men to be neutral, and to associate themselves with a view 
to acquire strength by unity and to use the strength so acquired in working out 
their social and political emancipation' (The General Council of the First 
International. 1864-1866. The London Conference 1865. Minutes, Moscow, 1964, 
p. 213).—287 
347 Mutualists, or supporters of mutual assistance, was the name adopted in the 
1860s by the French Proudhonists, adherents of Proudhon's reformist ideas on 
the emancipation of labour by organising mutual assistance, equitable exchange 
of services and cheap credit.—287 
348 A reference to the decisive battle in the Austro-Prussian war (see Note 345), 
which was fought at Königgrätz (Hradec-Krâlové) not far from the village of 
Sadowa (Bohemia) on 3 July 1866. The batde of Sadowa resulted in grave 
defeat for the Austrian forces. It is also known as the batde of Königgrätz. — 
288,  537 
349 At the end of 1865 and the beginning of 1866, Bismarck conducted 
negotiations with Napoleon III through the Prussian ambassador to Paris, von 
der Holtz. In the course of die negotiations, wishing to secure France's 
neutrality in the war against Austria which was being prepared by him, 
Bismarck sought to make Napoleon believe that die war would be extremely 
exhaustive for Prussia and hinted vaguely at the possibility of territorial 
expansion for France at the expense of Belgium and Luxemburg, as well as 
certain German territories on the Rhine.—289, 293 
350 As a result of the resignation of the Russell Liberal government and in protest 
against the impending coming to power of the Conservatives headed by Derby 
and Disraeli, mass meetings took place in London's Trafalgar Square, on 
27 June and 2 July 1866, which again demanded manhood suffrage. In March 
1866 the Reform League abandoned this demand under the influence of 
bourgeois radicals (see Note 315), but in the situation its leadership had to 
return for some time to its former platform. These meetings, which began a 
new stage in the struggle for a second electoral reform in Britain, had virtually 
been organised by members of the Central Council of the International.—290

351 In referring to Thiers' criticism of the foreign policy of the Second Empire, 
Marx, apparendy, had in mind his speech of 3 May 1866 in the Corps législatif 
to which Napoleon III responded with a speech in Auxerre on 6 May 1866 (see 
Note 332). On 6 July 1866 the government of Napoleon III submitted a 
project of a senatus-consulte to the French Senate in accordance with which it 
was the Senate's exclusive right to discuss any alterations in the Constitution; 
discussion of any such matters in the press was to be prohibited under the 
threat of heavy fines; and the clause in the Constitution of 1852 establishing a 
three-month term for the forthcoming session of the Corps législatif was to be 
abolished. The senatus-consulte was adopted by the Senate on 14 July 1866. 
During the debates on the budget for 1867 in the Corps législatif on 14 
June 1866, one of the leaders of the bourgeois-republican opposition, Jules 
Favre, criticised the Mexican expedition (see Note 270) which involved 
tremendous expenses. At the same session another member of the republican 
opposition, Deputy Glais-Bizoin, expressed support for the parliamentary 
system referring to the French as a nation living under a regime of despotism. 
For this he was called to order by Walewski, Chairman of the Corps 
législatif.— 290 
352 On 4 July 1866, after the defeat of the Austrian army at Sadowa (see Note 
348),  the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph sent a telegram to Napoleon III in 
which he informed Napoleon that he was ready to secede to him Venetia 
provided that Napoleon would then secede this region to Italy, and he asked 
Napoleon III to act as intermediary between the belligerent states. Italy and 
Prussia agreed to Napoleon's mediation. In accordance with the peace treaty 
with Austria signed in Vienna on 3 October 1866 the region was returned to 
Italy.—291 
353 Marx is referring to the bulbs that his daughter Jenny received from Johann 
Carl Juta, husband of her aunt Louise, in Cape Town and sent to Engels with 
detailed instructions on how to grow them.—291, 294

barrelled muzzle-loading gun used in the British army in the eighteenth and 
the beginning of the nineteenth century.—291 
355 A reference to Prussia's annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, the Electorate 
of Hesse-Cassel, the Grand Duchy of Nassau and other territories as a result of 
its victory over Austria in the war of 1866. 
According to a report published in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung on 7 
June 1866, the King of Naples Francis II Bourbon, who had been overthrown 
by the Garibaldist movement, was presented with an honorary shield at an 
election meeting of the Prussian conservatives in Berlin which was chaired by 
Count Stolberg; however, at the same meeting there were calls for Prussia's 
union with the Italian 'revolution'.—  292,  345 
356 Certain South German states (such as Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden) took 
part in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 on the Austrian side.—  293,  295 
357 A reference to the projected settlement of the Austro-Prussian conflict that was 
proposed by the government of Napoleon III on 11 July 1866 in response to 
Prussia's peace terms. According to the project, an independent South 
German Confederation was to be formed, consisting of states lying south of 
the Main, similar to the former Confederation of the Rhine. In this way 
Napoleon III hoped to prevent the unification of Germany and to subordinate 
South German states to his protectorate.

Southern and Western Germany that was formed in July 1806 under the 
protectorate of Napoleon I. Napoleon's creation of this military and political 
stronghold in Germany was made possible by his defeat of Austria in 1805. 
Initially the Confederation incorporated sixteenth states (Bavaria, Württem­
berg, Baden and others), and later on another five states (Saxony, Westphalia, 
and others), which virtually became vassals of France. The Confederation fell 
apart in 1813, after the defeat of Napoleon's army.—294, 297

Marx is referring to five reports of the Children's Employment Commission 
(1863-66) and the Eighth Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council 
(1866) which was supplemented by Dr Hunter's report about the housing 
conditions of the workers; Dr Hunter's report was extensively used by Marx in 
Volume One of Capital (see the English edition of 1887, Part III, Chapter 
XXV and also Vol. 35 of the present edition).—296, 301, 383, 407, 551 
360 The plan for Little Germany was a scheme to unite Germany without Austria 
under Prussia's supremacy.— 297 
361 In his letters of 30 June to Marx and of 16 July 1866 to Engels Paul Stumpf 
from Mainz said that Wilhelm Liebknecht held a pro-Austrian stance in the 
Austro-Prussian war. In these letters, as well as in his letter to Marx of 10 July, 
Stumpf asked for instructions on the stand to be taken by the International's 
members in Mainz with regard to the military events.—298, 299 
362 On 16 July 1866, during the Austro-Prussian war, the free city of Frankfurt am 
Main, which sided with Austria, was captured by the Prussian army. An 
indemnity of six million guldens was imposed on it, the city senate was 
disbanded and the garrison and military organisations disarmed. On 19 July 
the Prussians raised the indemnity to twenty-five million guldens and 
demanded from the burgomaster Karl Fellner a list of the wealthiest and most 
influential citizens, whose property was to be a pledge for the payment of the 
indemnity. He hanged himself in protest on the night of 23 July.—299, 301, 
333 
363 Eschenheimer Gasse —the street in Frankfurt am Main where the Federal Diet 
was in 1816-66.—299 
364 A reference to the Slav Congress which met in Prague on 2 June 1848. It was 
attended by representatives of the Slav regions of the Austrian Empire. The 
Right, moderately liberal wing, to which Palacky and Safafik, the leaders of the 
Congress, belonged, sought to solve the nationalities question by achieving 
autonomy for the Slav regions within the framework of the Habsburg 
monarchy (Austro-Slavism doctrine). The Left, radical wing (including Sabina, 
Fric and Libelt) wanted joint action with the democratic movement in Germany 
and Hungary. The radical delegates took an active part in the people's uprising 
in Prague (12-17 June 1848) and were subjected to severe reprisals. On 16 
June the moderately liberal delegates declared the Congress adjourned 
indefinitely.—299 
3fi5 On 11 July 1859 Austria and France signed a separate preliminary peace treaty 
in Villafranca which put an end to the war of France and Piedmont against

Austria. In accordance with the treaty, Lombardy fell to France, but later on 
Napoleon III ceded it to Piedmont in exchange for Savoy and Nice; Venice was 
to remain under the Austrian domination and the dukes of Tuscany and 
Modena were to be reinstalled to their thrones. Although some clauses of the 
preliminary treaty were never implemented (e. g. the clause on the restoration 
of the dukes of Tuscany and Modena) or were altered, on the whole it formed 
the basis of the final peace treaty signed in Zurich on 10 November 1859. 
The peace treaty between Austria and Prussia was signed in Prague on 23 
August 1866. Under its terms Austria ceded its rights on Schleswig and 
Holstein and recognised Prussia's annexation of Hanover, Electorate of Hesse 
(Hesse-Cassel), Nassau and Frankfurt am Main; the German Confederation 
ceased to exist and instead of it the North German Confederation was formed 
under the hegemony of Prussia which did not incorporate Austria. The peace 
treaty between Austria and Italy was signed in Vienna on 3 October 1866. In 
accordance with it the region of Venice was returned to Italy, but its claims to 
Southern Tyrol and Trieste were rejected because of Prussia's opposition.— 
300,  345 
366 On 23 July 1866 the Reform League (see Note 155) called a meeting in Hyde 
Park in support of manhood suffrage. Although banned by the government, 
the meeting took place; there was a clash between its participants and the police 
and several dozen workers were arrested. On 24 and 25 July tens of thousands 
workers, many of them armed, gathered round Hyde Park. The police and 
army units were sent against the demonstrators and a state of siege was 
virtually introduced in the capital; a threat arose of a clash of the people with 
the police and army. In this situation on 25 July a delegation of the League 
headed by its President Edmond Beales met the Home Secretary Spencer 
Walpole and promised to persuade the demonstrators to disperse if the army 
and police were ordered out of the park. Walpole agreed to this and did not 
object to another meeting in Hyde Park due on 30 July. However, during its 
preparation, Walpole denied his permission. His words were confirmed by 
Austin Holyoake, a member of the League Council, in his report about this 
talks with Walpole published in The Times. Fearing the mounting revolutionary 
activity of the masses the Council decided not to call any open-air 
meetings.—300 
367 In May 1849, the republican Armand Marrast, President of the French 
Constituent Assembly, requested General Changarnier, a monarchist and 
commander of the Paris garrison, to bring in troops to defend the Assembly 
against the Bonapartists. Changarnier refused, declaring that he disapproved of 
'baïonnettes intelligentes', i. e. soldiers meddling in politics.— 302

History and People, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1977. The full 
version of the letter was published in The Letters of Karl Marx, New Jersey, 
1979.—303 
369 A reference to a note handed to Bismarck in early August 1866 by the French 
Ambassador to Berlin Vincent Benedetti; it demanded the restoration of the 
1814 frontiers as a compensation for France's neutrality during the Austro-
Prussian war. This meant that the Saar Basin, the Palatinate, and the Rhenish 
part of Hesse-Darmstadt with the fortresses of Landau and Mainz were to be 
given over to France. The note also suggested that the Prussian garrison should 
be withdrawn from Luxemburg. The claims of Napoleon III were based on 
the secret promises made by Bismarck before the Austro-Prussian war not to

impede the annexation of the German territories between the Rhine and Mosel 
by France in case the latter did not prevent the formation of the Prusso-Italian 
coalition and defeat of Austria. However, following the victory over Austria, 
Bismarck, who planned a war with France, changed his stand and rejected the 
French government's demands on 7 August.—306, 352 
370 This fact was later on cited by Engels in his unfinished work The Role of 
Violence in History which he wrote in 1887 and 1888 (see present edition, 
Vol. 26).—307 
371 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in K. Marx, On 
Education, Women and Children, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 
1975—307 
372 Marx was sending Engels a letter to him from Liebknecht of 10 August 1866 
along with a few issues of the Leipzig Mitteldeutsche Volkszeitung. The newspaper 
was founded in 1862 by liberals but in August 1866, after it had lost most of its 
subscribers it was sold to Liebknecht. He tried to turn it into a democratic 
paper and use it, as he wrote to Marx, to publicise the ideas and documents of 
the IWMA in Germany. However, on 29 August the publication was stopped by 
the Prussian military authorities of the city and was never renewed again.—310 
37S This letter was first published in English in K. Marx, On Education, Women and 
Children, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1975.—310 
374 Marx is referring to his regular contributions to the New-York Daily Tribune 
which he made for over ten years, from August 1851 to March 1862.— 311 
375 The Geneva Congress—the first congress of the International Working Men's 
Association—took place between 3 and 8 September 1866. It was attended by 
60 delegates from the Central (General) Council, various sections of the 
International and workers' societies in Britain, France, Germany and Switzer­
land. Hermann Jung was elected chairman. In preparing for the Congress 
Marx wrote 'Instructions for the Delegates of the Provisional General Council. 
The Different Questions' (see present edition, Vol. 20). This document was 
read as the official report of the Council. 
The Proudhonists who enjoyed one-third of the votes at the Congress 
countered Marx's 'Instructions' with their own programme on all items of the 
agenda setting it out in a memorandum. Nevertheless, the Congress adopted a 
resolution based on six of the nine points formulated by Marx in the 
'Instructions': on the international combination of efforts in the struggle 
between labour and capital, on limitation of the working day, on juvenile and 
children's labour, on co-operative labour, on trade unions, and on standing 
armies. A compromise resolution on Poland was moved by Johann Philipp Becker 
and was adopted. 
The Geneva Congress approved the Rules and the Regulations of the 
International Association and elected its General Council (officially called 
Central Council before the Congress) mostly in its former composition. The 
Congress completed the formation of the International as a mass international 
proletarian organisation.—312, 314, 316, 326, 368 
376 As a result of its victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia was able to embark on 
the unification of Germany under its aegis. Besides its direct annexation of 
certain territories (see Note 355), it compelled Austria to agree to the 
disbandment of the German Confederation, and also succeeded in signing 
alliance treaties with 17 North German states (north of the Main) which had

fought in the war on its side; later on Saxony and other German states joined 
alliance treaties. This form of union prepared the ground for the formation of 
the North German Confederation.—312, 349, 460 
377 Judging by this letter, Engels left for Germany on 24 August 1866. Presumably he 
visited his home town and other places in the Rhine Province of Prussia, and 
stayed with his relatives. Engels returned to Manchester probably in the latter half 
of September.—313, 330 
378 F rom the end of August till mid-September 1866, Jenny Marx was on holiday 
at the seaside.—314 
379 At the meeting of the General Council (as the Central Council began to be 
called after the Geneva Congress) on 25 September 1866 Marx informed it that he 
had received £5, the annual contribution, from Samuel Moore in 
Manchester. The receipt issued to Moore by the Treasurer of the Council, 
William Dell, Marx sent to Engels enclosed with this letter.— 317 
380 As far back as in March 1865, the Central Council of the International adopted 
a resolution on the conflict in the Paris Section in which it opposed the 
Proudhonist thesis that only a worker was admissible as an official in the 
working men's organisation. During the discussion of the General Rules and 
the Regulations at the Geneva Congress (see Note 375), the French delegate 
Tolain declared that only a person directly engaged in manual labour could be 
a delegate to the congress. Tolain's statement met with stiff opposition. Cremer 
and Carter emphasised in their speeches the fact that many of the people to 
whom the International owed its very existence were not manual workers. They 
particularly noted the services of Marx who, as Cremer said, had made fight 
for the triumph of the working class the cause of his entire life. Tolain's 
amendment was rejected.— 318 
381 At the proposal of the French delegates Tolain and Fribourg, the Geneva 
Congress expelled Le Lubez from the General Council for his slander and 
intrigues. At the General Council meeting of 16 October 1866 the matter, at Le 
Lubez's demand, was referred to the Standing Committee, which at the Council 
meeting of 23 October confirmed the correctness of the report on Le Lubez's 
unanimous expulsion with the minutes of the Congress (see The General Council 
of the First International. 1866-1868. Minutes, Moscow, 1964, p. 51).—

missionary Santamaria that the black people descended from white people.— 
320 
383 Xhe workers' congress in Baltimore was held from 20 to 25 August 1866. It 
was attended by 60 delegates representing 60,000 American workers organised 
in trade unions. The Congress discussed such matters as the legal introduction 
of an eight-hour working day, political activities, co-operative societies, the 
unification of all workers in trade unions, strikes, and housing conditions. It 
was decided at the Congress to form the National Labour Union.—326 
384 In his letter to Marx of 11 October 1866 Kugelmann said that he had not 
received any letters from him since April of that year and that he believed that 
the subsequent letters might have been either lost or intercepted. Later on it 
turned out that Marx's letter to Kugelmann of 23 August 1866 (see this volume, 
pp. 311-12) was only received on 27 November 1866.— 327

summarised his A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy which had been 
published in 1859 (see present edition, Vol. 29). In the second and subsequent 
German editions of Volume One of Capital and in the English edition of 1887, 
this chapter ('Commodity and Money') comprises Part I (see present edition, 
Vol. 35).—328 
386 xhis letter is a reply to Kugelmann's letter of 23 October 1866. Kugelmann 
advised Marx to ask Engels for his help in arranging the loan; he also 
suggested that Marx should make the same request to a well-known doctor, 
A. Jacobi, a former activist in the Communist League, who lived in New 
York.—330 
387 The Code pénal was introduced in 1811 in Napoleon's France and in the 
regions of Western and South-Western Germany conquered by the French. 
Article 2 of the Code says: 'Any attempt to commit an offence that manifested 
itself in practical acts and was accompanied by the commencement of the 
commitment of the offence and that was interrupted or was not carried out owing 
solely to circumstances that were beyond the control of the person in question 
shall be equivalent to an offence proper.'—333 
388 Early in September 1866 the Prussian Chamber of Deputies passed an 
Indemnity Bill submitted by Bismarck. The Bill relieved the government of any 
responsibility for expenditures which had not been legally approved during the 
constitutional conflict (see Note 100). Thus the conflict ended with the 
complete capitulation of the bourgeois opposition to the Bismarck government. 
Deputies Karl Twesten and Frenzel, who belonged to the opposition and had 
more than once criticised the government, now voted for the Bill. Nevertheless, 
early in November 1866 they were once again put on trial on the basis of the 
Supreme Tribunal's decision of 29 January 1866 (see Note 292) for their 
former speeches in the Prussian Provincial Diet but were again acquitted.— 333

391 A reference to the commercial treaty between Britain and France of 23 January 
1860.  In accordance with the treaty the duties on British goods exported to France 
were not to exceed 30 per cent of their price; France had the right to duty-free 
import of most of her goods to Britain.— 334 
398 A reference to the defeat of the Democratic Party to which President Johnson 
belonged in the elections to Congress in November and December 1866. 
Johnson pursued a policy of compromise with the plantation-owners of the 
Southern states and opposed the granting of electoral rights to the Negroes. 
The elections were won by the Republicans who had received two-thirds of the 
votes in Congress.— 334 
393 Nos. 52 and 53 of the Berlin satirical weekly Kladderadatsch of 18 November 
1866 carried a lampoon, Die Frau in Weiß. Drama in 5 Acten mit freier Benutzung

author was Heinrich Bettziech, a German petty-bourgeois democrat, who wrote 
under the pen-name of Beta. 
The Brimstone Gang was the name of a students' association at Jena 
University in the 1770s which was notorious for its members' brawls; 
subsequently, the expression 'Brimstone Gang' became widespread.

644 Notes 
In his pamphlet Mein  Prozeß  gegen die 'Allgemeine Zeitung' which was published 
in 1859 the petty-bourgeois democrat Karl Vogt called Marx and his party 
comrades 'the Brimstone Gang'. However, this was a jocular name for a group 
of German émigrés that existed in Geneva in 1849 and 1850 with which Marx 
and his supporters were not connected. Marx exposed Vogt's slander in his 
pamphlet Herr Vogt which was published in 1860 (see present edition, Vol. 17). 
Wilhelm Liebknecht was arrested in Berlin on 2 October 1866 after he had 
made an anti-government speech in the Berlin Printers' Union. He was 
sentenced to three months imprisonment.—336 
394 A reference to the letter to Engels of 6 December 1866 from the refugee 
Hossfeld who lived in Liverpool. He asked Engels to lend him some 
money.— 337 
395 A reference to the seizure by the French authorities of letters written by 
members of the International, their confiscation of documents of the Geneva 
Congress and the pressure that the Bonapartist circles brought to bear on the 
British government in order to prevent the publication of Congress documents 
in Le Courrier international Early in January 1867 the General Council 
published a statement entitled 'The French Government and the International 
Association of Working Men' in which it exposed the actions of the ruling 
circles of the Second Empire towards the International (see The General Council  of 
the First International. 1866-1868. Minutes, Moscow, 1974, pp. 271-76).—338 
396 Head Centre was the code name of the leader of the Fenian secret organisation 
(see Note 257). At the General Council meeting of 4 December 1866 it was 
reported that James Stephens, the leader of the Irish Fenians who had been 
arrested late in 1865 but escaped from prison and emigrated to the United 
States, had joined the International.—338 
397 On 6 December 1866 Pius IX addressed the officers of the French regular 
forces before their evacuation from the Papal States on Napoleon Ill's order. 
In his speech the Pope virtually expressed his disapproval of this act by the 
French Emperor and asked for him to be informed that he should act 'as the 
head of a Christian state and a good Christian', in other words, he should take 
effective measures to prevent the incorporation of the Papal States into the 
Italian Kingdom.—338 
398 \Jarx used A History of Agriculture and Prices in England by James Thorold 
Rogers in Chapter VI of Volume One of Capital which later became a section

401 The substitution system was for a long time practised in the French army 
whereby members of the wealthier classes had the privilege of being able to 
free themselves from military service by hiring substitutes. During the French 
Revolution this was prohibited; however, Napoleon I introduced it again. 
Under the law of 1855, substitutes were to be selected by government bodies

and the payment for them was to be made to a special 'army donation' fund. The 
substitution system was abolished in France in 1872.— 340 
402 Jules Gottraux, a Swiss-born subject of Great Britain and a member of the 
International, was detained by the French police on the Franco-Swiss border on 
30 September 1866 when he was returning to London from Geneva. The 
police confiscated letters and printed matter which were to be handed to the 
General Council. The General Council made a public protest against this arbitrary 
act and other acts hostile to the International committed by the Bonapartist 
authorities and demanded the return of the seized documents (see Note 395). 
Receiving no reply from the French Minister of the Interior to its petition that 
the documents be returned, the General Council appealed to Lord Edward 
Stanley, the British Foreign Secretary, who through Henry Cowley, the British 
Ambassador to Paris, succeeded in returning the papers. At its meeting of 
1 January 1867 the General Council passed a resolution in which it thanked Lord 
Stanley for his  help.—341,  346 
403 A reference to the black-white-red flag of the North German Confederation 
which was founded in 1867 under the supremacy of Prussia (at the time the 
letter was written preparations were being carried on for forming it), and later 
of the German Empire.—344 
404 Marx used this information given by Engels in Volume One of Capital (see 
present edition, Vol. 35; English edition of 1887, Part IV, Chapter XV, Section 
5, pp. 434-35).—345 
405 Article 4 of the Peace Treaty of Prague between Prussia and Austria recognised 
the independence of the German states lying south of the Main and their right 
to form a separate South German Confederation (Napoleon Ill's aim). At the 
same time it mentioned the national ties between the North and South German 
states and envisaged the possibility of their joining the planned North German 
Confederation under Prussia's supremacy. In August 1866 Bismarck made a 
secret defence alliance with the South German states which provided that in the 
event of war their armies would be placed under the Prussian high 
command.— 345 
406 In his letter to Marx of 15 February 1867 Ludwig Kugelmann enclosed a notice 
from the Hanover liberal newspaper Zeitung für Norddeutschland, No. 5522, of the 
same day which reported Marx's intention to go to the Continent with the alleged 
aim of preparing a Polish insurrection. Sending the text of his refutation ('A 
Correction', see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 202) Marx considered its publication 
all the more necessary since he did plan to visit Germany to take the manuscript of 
Volume One of Capital to the publisher Otto Meissner in Hamburg and to agree 
about the terms of its publication. 
On 21 February 1867 the Zeitung für Norddeutschland was forced to print a 
refutation of its fabrication about Marx's intention to take an active part in the 
preparations for a future insurrection in Poland. On 22 February Kugelmann 
sent the published refutation to Marx. This was probably what Marx told 
Engels in his letter of 25 February.—346, 347, 352 
407 The report on the Geneva Congress of the International (see Note 375) was 
published in English in The International Courier, Nos. 7-15 of 20 February, 13, 
20 and 27 March, and 3, 10 and 17 April 1867 and in French in Le Courrier 
international, Nos. 8-16 of 9, 16, 23 and 30 March and 6, 13, 20 and 27 April 
1867.—346

which took place in Germany in February 1867. Two Saxon constituencies 
elected August Bebe) who became the first ever working-class representative in 
the German parliament and the lawyer Reinhold Schraps, the candidate of the 
Saxon People's Party. Wilhelm Liebknecht had been in prison for three months 
until the middle of January and was therefore unable to organise an election 
campaign and to win the elections.— 348 
409 A reference to the constituent North German Reichstag convoked on the basis 
of universal suffrage that had been proclaimed by Bismarck. The Reichstag 
held its sessions from 24 February to 17 April 1867; it approved the creation of 
the North German Confederation and its constitution, which became valid on 
1 July 1867.—349 
410 The weekly Hermann, No. 426, 2 March 1867, reprinted from the Volks-Zeitung 
Stieber's statement which refuted the report published in the Hermann, 
No. 424, to the effect that in January 1860 lie had attempted to bribe its editorial 
board in order to prevent the further publication of an article by Wilhelm 
Eichhoff exposing Stieber's activities as an agent provocateur during the Cologne 
Communist trial. Under this statement of Stieber's the editors placed a statement 
by R. Hirschfeld, the owner of the print-shop where at that time the weekly 
had been printed. Hirschfeld's statement cited facts showing Stieber's attempt to 
bribe the editorial board in January 1860. On 8 March 1867 the Volks-Zeitung 
carried a new statement by Stieber, in which he again denied his attempt.— 
349 
411 A reference to the secret peace negotiations between France and Russia in 1855 
during the Crimean war (1853-56) waged by the Anglo-Franco-Turkish coalition 
and Tsarist Russia. They were conducted through Baron Seebach, Saxony's envoy 
to Paris, who had important connections at the Russian court.— 349 
412 On 10 April 1867 Marx went to Germany to deliver the manuscript of Volume 
One of Capital to the publisher Otto Meissner. He arrived in Hamburg by boat on 
12 April. Having made all the arrangements with Meissner, he came to Hanover 
on 16 April and stayed with Ludwig Kugelmann till the middle of May. On 
his way back to Britain Marx once again saw Meissner in Hamburg on 16 and 
17 May and returned to London on 19 May 1867.—350, 356, 366, 375, 
379 
413 In his note to Marx of 1 April 1867 Sigismund Borkheim told him that 'a 
continental friend' ('ein Freund vom Kontinent') had written to him about 
Marx's strained circumstances and his need of the Party's material support.— 350, 
352 
4,4 On 25 January 1867, the Paris Bronze-Workers' Credit and Solidarity Society 
(Société de crédit et de solidarité des ouvriers du bronze) sent a circular to its 
members calling upon them to prepare for a general strike of solidarity with 
Barbedienne's bronze-workers who demanded fixed rates. They went on 
strike in February. In response to this, the owners of 120 enterprises adopted, 
at their meeting on 14 February, a resolution threatening to impose a lock-out 
if the society were not dissolved. A general meeting of bronze-workers that was 
held on 24 February and was attended by nearly 3,000 people resolved to fight 
the employers. The General Council of the International was immediately 
informed of this by a delegation of the bronze-workers' society specially sent to 
London, consisting of Camelinat, Kin, and Valdun who were joined by Tolain 
and Fribourg. On the initiative of Jung, Dupont and other members of the 
General Council funds began to be raised to aid the Paris workers. The broad 
movement of solidarity, which had been organised by the General Council, 

=====第685页=====
Notes 647 
served to keep up the strikers' militant spirit and undermined the employers' 
position. Negotiations between employers and workers began at individual 
factories, and on 24 March representatives of the employers' association agreed 
to introduce fixed rates for separate jobs.—351 
415 Early in 1867 a conflict broke out between the ruling circles of Prussia and 
France, since both sides had claims to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, which 
was connected by a personal union with the Netherlands (the King of the 
Netherlands was also the Grand Duke of Luxemburg) and was also a member 
of the German Confederation. However, after the latter was disbanded in 1866, 
Luxemburg refused to enter the North German Confederation which had been 
formed under Prussia's aegis. The government of Napoleon III and the King of 
the Netherlands agreed on the sale of Luxemburg to France, but Bismarck 
prevented it by making use of the Prussian garrison that was stationed in the 
duchy when the German Confederation still existed. 
In May 1867 the Luxemburg question was discussed at an international 
conference in London which made it a duty of the European powers to 
guarantee the preservation of Luxemburg's former status and neutrality. 
Prussia was to withdraw its troops from the duchy. In both states the 
Luxemburg conflict entailed preparations for war and extensive militaristic 
propaganda and became a stage in the preparation for the Franco-Prussian war 
of 1870-71.—351, 352, 364, 459 
416 in  response to the protest of the Polish deputies to the North German 
Reichstag against the forcible incorporation of the Principality of Posen and 
other Polish territories in the North German Confederation, Bismarck made a 
demagogical speech on 18 March 1867 in the Reichstag in which he said in 
particular that the Polish peasantry trusted the Prussian and Russian authorities 
more than their own nobility.—351, 374 
417 In his speech of 11 March 1867 in the North German Reichstag Bismarck said: 
'Gentlemen! Let us quickly get down to work! Let us put Germany in the 
saddle, as it were! She will be able to ride.' On 23 March of the same year a 
conservative deputy to the Reichstag, Hermann Wagener ended his speech with 
the words Engels cites in his letter.—355 
418 According to the arrangement with the publisher that Marx mentions in his 
letter, he planned after the publication of Volume One of Capital (appeared in 
September 1867) to publish Book Two and Book Three as Volume Two, and 
Book Four, which contained a critical history of economic theories, as a 
concluding Volume Three. 
After Marx's death, Engels prepared for the press and published 
manuscripts belonging to Book Two and Book Three as Volumes Two and 
Three of Capital; he died before he could prepare for the press Book Four, 
Theories of Surplus Value (Volume Four of Capital) and have it published (see also 
Note 227).—357, 358, 367, 368, 371, 390, 402, 405, 407, 418, 436, 442, 509, 511,

420 Guelphs (Welfs)—members of a separatist party formed in Hanover following 
its annexation by Prussia in 1866. It consisted of supporters of the restoration 
of the independent Hanover monarchy headed by the house of Welfs which 
was once on the throne there.—  361,  492

421 Head-in-chief (Haupt-Chef) —the name given by Wilhelm Stieber, one of the 
organisers of the Cologne Communist trial in 1852, to a police spy, Julian 
Cherval (real name Joseph Cramer). Stieber sought to represent Cherval as a 
dangerous conspirator and leader of the Communist League and make it 
appear that he was connected with Marx and the defendants (see K. Marx, 
Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, present edition, Vol. 11, 
pp. 407-19).—361 
422 A reference to the subscription for Ferdinand Freiligrath that was started in 
the spring of 1867. The poet's admirers wanted to present him with a 'people's 
donation' since he had lost his post of manager in the English branch of the 
Bank of Switzerland after the latter's bankruptcy. With this aim in view, 
committees were organised in Britain, Germany and the United States through 
which funds were gathered. Reports about the subscription were regularly 
published in the London newspaper Hermann.—  362,  378, 385, 425, 472, 532 
42S A reference to the publicity Lassalle managed to achieve for his book about 
Heraclitus' philosophy, published in 1858. For this purpose he made use of his 
friends and officially joined the society of German Old Hegelian 
philosophers.—363 
424 The 'nationalities principle' was put forward by the ruling circles of the Second 
Empire and was extensively used by them as an ideological smoke-screen for 
their plans of conquest and adventurous foreign policy. Seeking to pass himself 
off as a 'defender of nationalities', Napoleon HI took advantage of the national 
interests of the oppressed nations with the aim of strengthening the hegemony 
of France and extending her frontiers. This principle was also used in the 
diplomacy of Tsarist Russia to spread Russian influence to the Balkans and 
Central Europe. The demagogical nature of the 'nationalities principle' used by 
the ruling circles of counter-revolutionary European states was exposed by 
Marx in his pamphlet Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17) and by Engels in 
the article 'What Have the Working Classes to Do with Poland?' (present 
edition, Vol. 20).—364 
425 A reference to the second Reform Bill which was finally approved by 
Parliament on 15 August 1867. In accordance with the new law, the property 
qualifications for electors was lowered for lease-holders in the counties to 
12-pound rent a year, and in the towns franchise was granted to all 
householders, and house tenants, and those tenants who had held their place of 
residence for not less than a year and paid not less than £10. Although as a 
result of the 1867 reform the number of electors in Britain doubled, and 
suffrage was also extended to a section of skilled industrial workers, the bulk of 
the country's population remained disfranchised as before.—365, 384, 468

F. Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895, London, 1934. In full the letter was

the demand of the Prussian government. The pretext for this was Marx's part

in editing the newspaper Vorwärts! which violendy criticised Prussian reactionary 
order. Early in February Marx had to emigrate to Belgium. 
On 19 July 1849, Marx who was again in Paris—this time after the defeat 
of the German revolution—received a notice from the French authorities 
ordering him to leave Paris and move to the Department of Morbihan, a swampy 
and unhealthy part of Brittany. This prompted his departure to London in the 
second half of August 1849.—368 
429 Marx's attempts to find somebody to translate Capital into French were 
unsuccessful at the time. On the French translation of Volume One of Capital 
see Note 539.-368 
430 A reference to a cross given to Jenny on her birthday. Such crosses were worn 
by participants in the Polish national liberation struggle. Since the end of 1867 
Jenny wore it on a green ribbon as a symbol of her mourning over the Irish 
Fenians executed in November 1867 (green colour was a symbol of struggle for 
the national liberation of Ireland).— 369, 479 
431 The Manichaeans were the followers of a religious trend current in the Middle 
East in the third century of the Christian era, its characteristics being asceticism 
and celibacy. In German students' slang the word Manichaean stood for a 
merciless creditor (in consonance with the German 'mahnender Gläubiger', i. e. 
a creditor demanding the payment of debt).— 372, 436 
432 The National-Liberals—a party of the German, above all Prussian, bourgeoisie 
which was formed in the autumn of 1866 after a split in the Party of Progress 
(see Note 99). Their policy showed that a considerable section of the liberal 
bourgeoisie had abandoned its claims to extend its political prerogatives and 
capitulated to the Bismarck Junker government after Prussia's victory in the 
Austro-Prussian war and the establishment of her supremacy in Germany.— 
372, 421, 504 
433 In June 1849 the right-wing liberal deputies of the Frankfurt National 
Assembly, who walked out after the Prussian King Frederick William IV had 
refused to accept the Imperial Crown, met in Gotha for a conference which 
resulted in the formation of the so-called Gotha party. The objective of this 
party, which reflected the sentiments of the big bourgeoisie and feared the 
victorious outcome of the revolution, was to achieve the unification of the 
Germany (with the exception of Austria) under the hegemony of Prussia. 
There was a certain continuity between the Gotha party and the National-
Liberals.—372 
434 In 1846 Marx and Engels negotiated through Joseph Weydemeyer the 
financing of the publication of their two-volume work criticising the German 
ideology (see present edition, Vol. 5) with the Westphalian publishers Julius 
Meyer and Rudolph Rempel. In July 1846, after a series of subterfuges and 
delays, Meyer and Rempel refused their promised assistance on the pretext of 
financial difficulties, the actual reason being the differences of principle 
between Marx and Engels, on the one hand, and the champions of 'true 
socialism', on the other, whose views both publishers shared. 
In the spring of 1845 Hermann Kriege, one of the future exponents of 
'true socialism', was recommended by Meyer to Engels and Marx and met the 
former in Barmen and the latter in Brussels.—373

Miquel demanded that a North German Confederation should be formed as a

single centralised state under the hegemony of Prussia and urged the other 
German states to sacrifice their freedom for Germany's unification.—373 
436 Cremorne gardens existed in the 1850s-1870s in London; they were closed in 
1877.—376 
437 Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester from approximately 22 May to 2 June 
1867.—377, 379 
438 During his stay in Hanover in April and May 1867, Marx decided to write an 
appendix on forms of value for Volume One of Capital—an idea that was 
supported by Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wanted to supplement and specify 
Chapter I of the main text on commodities and money. He implemented this idea 
in the first edition of Volume One (1867). In the second German edition of 1872 
Marx revised this appendix and incorporated it in the relevant passages of the 
text. In the subsequent editions of Capital, including the English one of 1887 
edited by Engels, the text was given in this form.—378, 384, 392, 396, 402, 423 
439 A reference to the 'Report of the Commissioners on the Treatment of the 
Treason-Felony Convicts in the English Convict Prisons' by the police 
magistrate Alexander Knox and the medical officer George Pollock published 
in London in 1867 on Parliament's decision. The report dealt with the 
treatment of political prisoners, especially Irish Fenians (see Note 257) in the 
English prisons.—378, 383, 390, 394 
440 The Times of 3 June 1867 carried a report by its Paris correspondent which 
stated that during the ceremony of welcome for the Russian Emperor 
Alexander II in Paris, there had been shouts of 'Long Live Poland' in the 
crowd. At the meeting of 18 June 1867 the General Council of the First 
International passed a resolution approving the mass demonstration of solidarity 
in Paris with the Poles suppressed by Tsarism. The text of the,Council's resolution 
was published in The Commonwealth, No. 224 of 22 June 1867 (see The General 
Council of  the First International. 1866-1868. Minutes, Moscow, 1974, pp. 129-30).—

441 In Hegel's terminology, 'Knoten' ('nodal points') are certain moments in 
movement when a sudden qualitative leap takes place as a result of gradual 
quantitative change (see G. W. F. Hegel, Wissenschaft der Logik, Erstes Buch, 
Dritter Abschnitt, Zweites Kapitel). —382 
442 The Royal Commission to Make Inquiry Respecting the English Trade Unions 
was set up in February 1867 because the ruling classes were anxious about the 
mounting trade unions' activity and hoped that such inquiry would help to 
outlaw the trade unions or at least restrict the scope of their activity. At the 
same time an anti-trade union campaign was launched in bourgeois newspap­
ers. The trade unions, supported by the General Council of the International, 
responded with meetings all over the country and a national conference in 
London on 5-8 March 1867. After the inquiry the Royal Commission failed to 
make any serious charges against the trade unions, but it hindered their complete 
legalisation (the legal protection of their funds, and the recognition of their right 
to fight strike-breakers and to support strikes organised by other trade 
unions).—384, 387, 426 
443 The new inquiry into working conditions resulted in the law of 15 August 1867 
which extended the validity of the factory acts to new industries. Now the

maximum working-day for women and children below eighteen years of age 
was restricted to 10 li hours, not only at the factories but also at smaller 
enterprises and in the domestic industry.—384 
444 Marx is referring to Chapter III of the first edition of Volume One of Capital; 
in the second and subsequent editions it corresponds to five chapters (V-IX) of 
Part III and in the English edition of 1887 to chapters VII-XI (see present 
edition, Vol. 35). 
The note to the text of the first edition that is mentioned here stated that 
the molecular theory was advanced by Auguste Laurent and Charles Frédéric 
Gerhardt, and Charles Adolphe Wurtz was the first who scientifically 
elaborated it. Later on Marx made an additional study of the history of this 
problem and omitted his reference to Wurtz in the second German edition of 
Volume One of Capital (1872); in the third edition of the volume (1883) Engels 
also made a more precise assessment of the role that had been played by 
Laurent and Gerhardt (see the English edition of 1887, Part III, Chapter XI, 
and the present edition, Vol. 35).—385 
445 Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England appeared in the spring of 
1845.  The part of the edition that had not been sold out was put on sale later 
on with a new tide page dated 1848.—385 
446 A reference to Chapter II ('The Transformation of Money into Capital') and 
Chapter III ('Production of Absolute Surplus-Value') of the first edition of 
Volume One of Capital. They correspond to Parts II and III in the second and 
subsequent German editions, and to Parts II and III (chapters IV-XI) of the 
English edition of 1887 (see present edition, Vol. 35).—386 
447 One of the reasons for appointing the Royal Commission to Make Inquiry 
Respecting the English Trade Unions (see Note 442) was the excesses 
committed in 1865-66 in Sheffield, the centre of metal-working industry, by 
some trade-unionists against strike-breakers. The Commission, however, failed 
to make any serious charges against the trade unions, since these instances were 
few and far between.—387

449 Between 5 July and early August 1867 Engels travelled in Sweden, Denmark 
and Germany and visited Ludwig Kugelmann in Hanover. His wife Lizzie 
Burns accompanied him during some part of the trip.—  389,  391, 392, 395, 
396, 399, 401, 444, 469 
450 Marx is referring to the last section of Chapter V in the first edition of Volume 
One of Capital. It corresponds to Chapter XVII of Part VI in the second and 
subsequent German editions of this volume and to Chapter XIX of Part VI in 
the English edition of 1887 (see present edition, Vol. 35).—390 
451 The paras mentioned in the letter, including the criticism of the theory of 
Nassau William Senior, were in Chapter III of the first edition of Volume One 
of Capital, and correspond to chapters VII and VIII of Part III in the second 
and subsequent German editions of this volume, and to chapters IX and X of 
Part III in the English edition of 1887 (see present edition, Vol.  35).—391,  392

and the Prime Minister Derby in the House of Lords on 20 June 1867. Stanley 
and Derby expressed their approval of the treaty on Luxemburg signed at the 
international conference in London on 11 May 1867. This treaty which 
guaranteed the former status and neutrality of Luxemburg put an end to the 
so-called Luxemburg crisis (see Note 415).—394 
453 In his reply to Marx of 20 July 1867 Freiligrath evaded a direct answer to 
Marx's question (see M. Häckel, Freiligraths Briefwechsel mit Marx und Engels, 
Th. 1, Berlin, 1968, S. 181).—398 
454 For the second German edition of Volume One of Capital (published by 
Meissner in Hamburg in 1872) Marx revised and enlarged the text and 
improved the structure of the book. In doing this he also took into account the 
suggestions Engels made in this letter. Instead of the origina] six chapters the 
second and subsequent German editions of Volume One contained seven parts 
comprising 25 chapters. Chapter IV, which is being discussed in this letter, 
became Part IV consisting of four chapters; Chapter XII was divided into five 
and Chapter XIII into ten sections. The text of this volume in the English 
edition of 1887, edited by Engels, was divided into even more chapters. 
Chapter IV of the first edition corresponds to Part IV, chapters XII, XIII, 
XIV (sections 1-5) and Chapter XV (sections 1-10) (present edition, Vol. 35).— 
406, 407, 436 
455 The reference is to Chapter VI ('The Process of the Accumulation of 
Capital') of the first edition of Volume One of Capital which corresponds to 
Part VII of the second and subsequent German editions, and to chapters 
XXIII-XXV of Part VII of the English edition of 1887 (see present edition, 
Vol. 35).—406, 409 
456 Part of the Preface to Volume One of Capital was soon published in a number 
of German periodicals such as Die Zukunft, No. 206 of 4 September 1867; Der 
Beobachter, No. 210 of 7 September 1867; Der Vorbote, Nos. 9-11 of September-
November 1867; and Demokratisches Wochenblatt of 4 and 11 January 1868. The 
English translation of part of the Preface done by Georg Eccarius was 
published in The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No. 308 of 7 September 1867; the 
French translation done by Paul Lafargue and Marx's daughter Laura 
appeared in Le Courrier français, No. 106 of 1 October 1867 and in the 
Belgian newspaper La Liberté, No. 15 of 13 October 1867.—407, 423, 428, 
448, 450, 495, 527 
457 A reference to Marx's work on Book Two of Capital in which he analysed 'The 
Process of Circulation of Capital'. By that time Marx had already finished the 
first rough version of the book, it being written presumably in the first half of 
1865.  From the latter half of 1865 to August 1867 he wrote another two 
manuscripts dealing with the subject. Between the end of 1868 and 1870 Marx 
wrote a second, complete version of this book, which, along with his later 
manuscripts, was subsequently used by Engels in preparing Volume Two of 
Capital for publication in 1885.—408

measures taken by the Turkish troops against the insurgents and civilians, the 
struggle continued, supported by volunteers from many other countries. 
The events on Crete brought about a new aggravation of the international 
contradictions in the Middle East. In November 1866 the Russian government 
proposed that the European powers should demand from the Turkish Empire 
the transfer of Crete to Greece. However, the western powers preferred Crete 
to remain under the Turkish rule since they were afraid that the position of 
Russia in the region might be strengthened and the national liberation 
movement of the nations ruled by the Sultan be further stepped up. The 
support of the Crete insurgents went no further than a joint statement made 
by Russia, France, Italy and Prussia of 29 October 1867 which recommended 
that the Turkish government should restrain from bloody excesses on Crete. In 
1869 the insurrection was completely suppressed.—414 
461 The League of Peace and Freedom—a pacifist organisation that was set up in 
1867 with the active participation of Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Garibaldi and 
other democrats. The League owed its origin to the anti-war sentiments of the 
masses. However, its leaders held pacifist positions; they failed to see the social 
causes of war and often confined its anti-war activity to mere declarations. 
The League's constituent congress was originally scheduled for 5 September 
1867 in Geneva. Its organising committee, which enjoyed the support of a 
number of radical and democratic public figures like John Stuart Mill and the 
Reclus brothers', also counted on the participation of the leaders of the 
European proletariat. Therefore the committee sent invitations to the sections 
of the Internationa] and its leaders, Marx included, to attend the congress. It 
was also decided to postpone the opening of the congress until 9 September, so 
that the delegates of the Lausanne Congress of the International (due on 
2-8 September) could take part in it too. 
The International's attitude towards the League of Peace and Freedom was 
discussed both in the General Council and in local sections. Marx's speech at 
the Council meeting of 13 August 1867 and the resolution adopted at his 
proposal (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 204) formulated the principles of 
the International's tactics in such a bourgeois-democratic movement. In 
contrast to the unconditional support of the League, which is what the leaders 
of the British trade unions inclined towards, the International's tactics 
envisaged both the joint participation with the democrats in the struggle against 
the threat of war, provided the class independence of the proletarian 
organisation was retained, and a revolutionary proletarian approach towards 
the questions of war and peace in opposition to bourgeois pacifist illusions. 
Marx believed that the International should not take part in the League's 
congress on an official basis because that would mean the International's 
solidarity with its bourgeois programme. However, it was recommended that 
the International's members should attend the congress privately in order to 
influence its decisions in a revolutionary-democratic way.—414, 424, 473, 517, 
537, 581 
462 The Lausanne Congress of the International was held from 2 to 8 September 
1867.  Marx took part in the preparations but he was unable to attend the 
congress, since he was busy reading the proofs of Volume One of Capital. 
The Congress was attended by 64 delegates from six countries (Britain, 
France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Italy). Apart from the report of 
the General Council (see present edition, Vol. 20), the Congress heard reports 
from the local sections which showed the increased influence of the

International on the proletariat and the growing strength of its organisations in 
different countries. The delegates holding Proudhonist views, especially those 
from France, sought to change the orientation of the International's activity 
and its programme principles. Having managed, despite the efforts of the 
General Council's delegates, to impose their agenda on the Congress, they 
sought to get the Congress to revise the Geneva Congress resolutions in a 
Proudhonist spirit. They did succeed in carrying through a number of their 
own resolutions, in particular the one on co-operation and credit, which they 
regarded as the principal instruments of changing society by means of reform. 
However, the Proudhonists failed to achieve their principal aim. The 
Congress retained as valid the Geneva Congress resolutions on the economic 
struggle and strikes. The Proudhonist dogma on abstaining from political 
struggle was countered by the resolution on political freedom passed by the 
Lausanne Congress which emphasised that the social emancipation of the 
working class was inseparable from its political liberation. The Proudhonists 
likewise failed to seize the leadership of the International. The Congress 
re-elected the General Council in its former composition and retained London 
as its seat.—416, 418, 420, 425, 427 
463 A reference to the printed sheets of Chapter VI, the last one, of Volume One 
of Capital. 
In the second German edition of Volume One (1872) Marx, on Engels' 
advice, substantially enlarged the section on Ireland and wrote some additional 
notes (see the English edition of 1887, Part VII, Chapter XXV, Section 5). 
The 'resume on the expropriation of the expropriators' mentioned by Engels 
is placed at the end of Chapter XXIV in the second and subsequent German 
editions and at the end of Chapter XXXII (Part VIII) of the English edition of 
1887 (see present edition, Vol. 35).—417, 432 
464 Der Social-Demokrat, No. 102 of 30 August 1867 carried a report that 
J. M. Hirsch, publisher of a collection of songs, and two owners of the 
printing-house where it was printed had been arrested in Erfurt. Hirsch was 
charged with high treason.—417 
465 The Royal Society of Arts—an educational and philanthropic organisation 
founded in Britain in 1754. It consisted mainly of businessmen and bour­
geois intellectuals and enjoyed the patronage of aristocracy. Marx violendy 
criticised the Society's attempts to act as a mediator in the conflicts between 
workers and employers with the aim of undermining the class struggle. 
At the same time he thought highly of its extensive library and its research 
publications of which he made use in his studies, especially in Capital. The 
Society's scientific material became available to him after he joined it in 
1869.—418 
466 This is apparently a reference to Emile de Girardin's articles in La Liberté of 
which he became the owner in June 1866. Girardin treated the situation in 
France at that time as similar to that during the pre-revolutionary years 1829 
and -1847.—418 
467 On 27 August 1867 during his visit to the French part of Flanders on the occasion 
of the anniversary of its annexation to France, Napoleon III made a speech in 
Lille in which he was rather pessimistic about France's situation at home and 
abroad.—418 
468 when the Civil War ended, the movement for the legislative introduction of an

eight-hour day were set up throughout the country; in California alone there 
were over 50. The National Labour Union, founded at a congress in Baltimore 
(see Note 383) in August 1866, joined the movement. Attaching great 
importance to the demand for the eight-hour working day Marx included it in 
the agenda of the Geneva Congress. In his 'Instructions for the Delegates of 
the Provisional General Council' he emphasised the need to raise it 'to the 
common platform of the working classes all over the world' (see present edition, 
Vol. 20, p. 187). This point as formulated by Marx was adopted as a congress 
resolution. 
On 25 June 1868, the US Congress which was forced to reckon with the 
mass movement, adopted a law on an eight-hour working day for the 
employees of all governmental and federal bodies.—418, 452 
469 Marx made a number of critical comments on the text of the speech prepared 
by Borkheim for the constituent congress of the League of Peace and Freedom 
in Geneva (see Note 461). Having delivered the speech at the congress, 
Borkheim then published it in French under the tide of 'Ma perle devant le 
congrès de Genève' and also in German.—419, 435, 437, 441, 449 
470 In addition to the ordinary footnotes for the first German edition of Volume 
One of Capital, Marx wrote nine notes in which he cited the latest facts from 
different sources. In preparing the second German edition (1872) he made 
some alterations in these additional notes and inserted them in the corresponding 
places of the main text. 
On the appendix to Chapter I see Note 438.—419 
471 A reference to Marx's speech on the International's attitude towards the 
congress of the League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 461) and the 
resolution on the issue proposed by him at the General Council meeting of 
13 August 1867 (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 204). Eccarius' brief report of 
the Council meeting was published in The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No. 305 of 
17 August 1867; it was also cited in Lucien Dubois' article 'Les Conditions de la 
paix', published in Le Courrier français on 2 September 1867.—420 
472 In his letter to Marx of 5 September 1867 Friedrich Lessner gave him 
extensive information about the beginning of the International's Lausanne 
Congress (see Note 462) and referred to the report published in the Gazette de 
Lausanne.—422 
473 A reference to the first of Eccarius' series of articles about the Lausanne 
Congress of the International published in The Times, No. 25909 of 
6 September 1867. The other articles of the series were published in The 
Times, Nos. 25911-25913 of 9-11 September 1867. In his articles Eccarius 
made ironical comments on the muddled views of the French Proudhonist 
delegates and their verbosity.—422, 425, 428, 434 
474 Beginning from 5 September 1867 Vermorel's newspaper Le Courrier français 
published Henri Tolain's articles about the International's Lausanne Congress 
(see Note 462) in which he praised the French delegates' position at the 
Congress.—422 
475 The activity of the Proudhonists at the International's Lausanne Congress (see 
Note 462) and the fact that they had some of their resolutions adopted, gave 
particular urgency to the struggle for the assertion of the main programme 
principles of scientific communism. In Marx's opinion, this task was to be 
carried out by the next Congress of the International which was to be held in

Brussels in September 1868. Thanks to the energetic preparatory work that was 
done by Marx and his followers, die decisions of the Brussels Congress, 
especially the one on the collective ownership of land, paralysed to a 
considerable extent the influence of the Proudhonists in the International 
Association.—424, 428 
476 The Berlin Workers' Association was founded in January 1863 and was under 
the influence of the men of Progress (see Note 99), especially of Schulze-
Delitzsch, and propagandised bourgeois co-operative societies. When the 
International Working Men's Association was set up, the advanced members of 
the Berlin Workers' Association were attracted towards it and sought to get rid 
of the liberals' protection. In October 1868 there was a split in the Berlin 
Workers' Association. Its radical members formed the Democratic Workers' 
Association which recognised the programme approved by the Nuremberg 
Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations (headed by August 
Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht) based on the International's principles. The 
Democratic Workers' Association waged a vigorous struggle against the 
Lassalleans. In 1869 it joined the Social-Democratic Workers' Party which came 
into being at the Eisenach Congress.—424, 477 
477 A reference to Lessner's letter of 7 September 1867 in which he informed 
Marx about the proceedings of the Lausanne Congress of the International (for 
Lessner's previous letter about the Congress see Note 472).—424, 429 
478 Contrary to the position held by Marx and the General Council of the 
International towards the bourgeois-pacifist League of Peace and Freedom (see 
Note 461), the Lausanne Congress, largely owing to the efforts of Johann 
Philipp Becker and other members of the Geneva Section of the International 
as well as the French Proudhonists, decided by majority vote to send an official 
delegation from the IWMA to the constituent congress of the League. On 
9 July 1867, before the Lausanne Congress, the general meeting of the 
Geneva Section of the International decided to join the League's 
programme and expressed their full confidence to its organisers; several members 
of the Section, including Becker and Dupleix, joined the League's Organising 
Committee.—425, 428 
479 To break the conspiracy of silence with which official bourgeois academics met 
the publication of Volume One of Marx's Capital, Engels resorted to a kind of 
stratagem by writing a number of reviews for some bourgeois newspapers 
which looked as if penned by an unbiased bourgeois scholar. The reviews were 
published in Die Zukunft, Elberfelder Zeitung, Düsseldorfer Zeitung, Staats-Anzeiger 
für Württemberg and others (see present edition, Vol. 20).—427 
480 In his letter to Marx of 9 September 1867 Johann Georg Eccarius informed 
him that he as well as Johann Philipp Becker, Ludwig Kugelmann, Sigismund 
Borkheim and others had been invited on 8 September to a preliminary 
conference of the German participants in the Geneva Congress of the League 
of Peace and Freedom (see Note 461). This conference made obvious the 
disagreements between participants in the workers' movement and the 
bourgeois democrats. Thus, in the discussion of the candidates to the presiding 
body of the Congress, the democrats Ludwig Simon and Jakob Venedey 
opposed the very principle of class representation and objected to Kugelmann, 
who had suggested that representatives of the proletariat be included in it. 
Nevertheless, as a result of the debates, Marx's followers Eccarius, Becker and

Borkheim and also Ludwig Büchner and Armand Goegg were elected German 
vice-presidents of the Congress.—429 
481 The June days—the proletarian uprising in Paris on 23-26 June 1848.—429 
482 From 13 September 1867, Marx and Paul Lafargue stayed for a few days with 
Engels in Manchester.—431, 432 
483 The reference is to the spot under the railway bridge in Manchester where on 
18 September 1867 Fenians made an armed assault on a police van in order to 
free two arrested Fenian leaders (see Note 497).—431 
484 Wilhelm Liebknecht was elected deputy to the North German Reichstag by one 
of the Saxon constituencies on 31 August 1867; he delivered his first speech in 
the Reichstag on 30 September 1867.—432 
485 This misprint ('C' instead of 'B') also appeared in the second and all the 
subsequent editions of Volume One of Capital that were published during the 
lifetime of Marx and Engels. —432 
486 In his first speech in the North German Reichstag on 30 September 1867 that 
he made in the discussion on the passports bill, Liebknecht violently criticised 
the police and bureaucratic order. He proposed a number of amendments to 
the bill that would restrict the authorities' arbitrary rule. Liebknecht's bold 
statements about the political system and the government's policy were 
repeatedly interrupted by Simson, president of the Reichstag, and his proposals 
were rejected. 
Apart from the reports in the newspapers, Liebknecht's speech was also 
published as a pamphlet, Was ich in Berliner Reichstag sagte, Leipzig, 
1867.—433,  444, 445, 450 
487 A reference to Kugelmann's letter to Marx of 29 September 1867 which was 
written on his return to Hanover from the Geneva Congress of the League of 
Peace and Freedom. In this letter Kugelmann informed Marx that during the 
election of five German vice-presidents of the Congress (see Note 480) Karl 
Vogt was also nominated and that he (Kugelmann) objected giving as a reason 
the exposure of Vogt as a Bonapartist agent by Marx in his pamphlet Herr 
Vogt. In spite of the efforts of several democrats, in particular, Ludwig Simon, 
Vogt was not elected vice-president of the Congress.—433, 442 
488 Marx quotes from Paul Stumpfs letter to him from Mainz of 29 September 1867. 
In very vague terms Stumpf asked Marx to explain to him certain factors of the 
process of pauperisation and prolétarisation of the petty bourgeoisie, artisans, 
etc.—434 
489 The decision to abolish the office of the General Council's President was moved 
on Marx's initiative by John Hales and adopted at the General Council meeting 
of 24 September 1867. The abolition of this post, which had been permanently 
held since 1864 by one of the British trade union leaders, George Odger, 
considerably weakened the positions of the reformist wing of the International. 
Odger did not get any post when the appointment of officers in the Council 
took place. Before this William Cremer had been dismissed from the post of 
General Secretary. The International's Basle Congress (September 1869) 
approved the General Council's decision.—434, 519 
490 -phe- letter to which Marx refers was sent by Peter Fox to Johann Philipp 
Becker in Geneva on 29 August 1867, on the eve of the Lausanne Congress, 
and was marked as 'personal and confidential'. Fox's reason for suggesting that

the seat of the General Council should be transferred to Geneva was that, in his 
opinion, guidance of the international labour movement kept the British 
members of the General Council away from more effective participation in the 
activities of the International's organisations in Britain.—434 
491 The editorial in The Times, No. 25917 of 16 September 1867, dealt with the 
Geneva Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 461). 
It gave an account of the speeches by Garibaldi, Quinet, Dupont, Bakunin and 
others, and also mentioned speech by Borkheim who, according to the newspaper, 
suggested 'the abolition of classes'.—435 
492 The title of this article which was published in Le Courrier français, No. 113 of 
8 October 1867, contains an allusion to La Fontaine's fable Les voleurs et 
lane.—438 
493 In his letter to Marx of 8 October 1867 Ludwig Kugelmann offered to publish 
short notes about Volume One of Capital and asked for the corresponding 
instructions. 
For Engels' efforts to popularise Volume One of Capital see Note 
479.-438,  443 
494 In February 1860 Marx who had started work on his pamphlet Herr Vogt 
wrote to Sigismund Borkheim, with whom he was not yet acquainted, asking 
him for any information that he could give about the so-called Brimstone Gang 
which existed in Geneva in 1849 and 1850 (see Note 393). Borkheim replied on 
12 February and Marx used his letter in his pamphlet to expose Vogt's 
slanderous fabrications about proletarian revolutionaries. Ever since Marx and 
Borkheim had been friends.—441 
495 The definition of peonage as a concealed form of slavery is given by Marx in 
Volume One of Capital (see the English edition of 1887, pp. 146-47 and 
present edition, Vol. 35).—442 
496 A reference to Engels' reviews of Volume One of Marx's Capital, of which one 
was published with Kugelmann's help in Die Zukunft, No. 254 of 20 October 
1867,  Supplement (unsigned), while the other, meant for the Rheinische Zeitung, 
remained unpublished (see Note 523).—443, 445, 449 
497 On 18 September 1867 in Manchester there was an armed assault on a police 
van in order to free Thomas Kelly and Michael Deasy, two Fenian leaders (see 
Note 257) who had been arrested after the suppression of the armed uprising 
of February and March 1867 organised by Fenians. Kelly and Deasy managed 
to escape but during a clash a police officer was killed and mass arrests 
followed. From 1 to 23 November a trial of the arrested Fenians was held in 
Manchester in the course of which false evidence and other disgraceful 
methods were used by the prosecution. In spite of all the efforts by the 
counsels for the defence, primarily by Ernest Jones, five Fenians were 
sentenced to death. One of them (Thomas Maguire) was subsequently 
pardoned; the death sentence of another (Condon), an American citizen, was 
commuted to life imprisonment; the other three (Michael Larkin, William Allen 
and Michael O'Brien) were hanged on 23 November. 
During the investigation of the case and the trial, the General Council of the 
International organised, on Marx's initiative, a broad campaign of the English 
workers in support of the Irish national liberation movement (see this volume, 
pp. 460, 464).—444, 460, 463, 466, 476, 479, 483

499 The Bill on Freedom of Movement and Settlement was submitted on 3 October 
1867 and passed by the North German Reichstag on 22 October. This was one 
in the series of legislative acts that were passed by the Reichstag from 1867 to 
1870 with the aim of eliminating the obstacles to capitalist development in 
Germany that had been inherited from the period of feudal dismemberment. 
On 21 October 1867 in the debates on the bill Wilhelm Liebknecht proposed to 
abolish certain police obstacles to freedom of movement that remained in 
force.—445 
500 A reference to extradition treaties which were concluded between various states 
and became especially widespread in the latter half of the 19th century.—

501 The German-language weekly in London How Do You Do} published abusive 
allusions to Marx's family connection with the Prussian Minister of the Interior, 
Ferdinand von Westphalen (Jenny Marx's stepbrother). On 19 August 1851 
Marx went with Ferdinand Freiligrath and Wilhelm Wolff to the editorial office 
of the paper and demanded satisfaction of the publisher Louis Drucker and 
the editor Heinrich Bettziech (Beta) (see present edition, Vol. 38, p. 432).— 
447 
502 A reference to the Illustrierte Familien-Kalender which had been published by 
A. H. Payne in Leipzig annually, since 1857. The article by Heinrich Bettziech 
(Beta) 'Die Deutschen in London' was published there.—447 
503 In his letter to Marx of 20 September 1867 a German emigre in New York, 
A. Nahmer, offered to translate into English Volume One of Capital. Marx 
asked some of his friends if they knew anything about Nahmer but none of 
them did, so he did not reply.—447, 450 
504 In his letter of 8 October 1867 Wilhelm Liebknecht informed Marx that he and 
another Reichstag deputy, Reincke, intended to table the proposal that a 
commission should be appointed for inquiry into the workers' condition in 
Prussia. To substantiate this proposal Liebknecht wanted to acquaint himself 
with the powers of similar commissions in England and asked Marx to send 
him the relevant legislative acts. 
Marx sent him the following acts: An Act for Facilitating in Certain Cases 
the Proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to make Inquiry respecting 
Trades Unions and other Associations of Employers or Workmen which had 
been passed by the British Parliament on 5 April 1867, and An Act to Extend 
the 'Trades Union Commission Act, 1867' which had been passed on 
12 August 1867.—448, 456, 489 
505 A reference to the letter that Ludwig Kugelmann wanted to send to 
Sigismund Borkheim. Kugelmann wrote about this to Marx on 13 October 
1867 asking for Marx's opinion of his intention to persuade Borkheim to 
refrain from extensively advertising his published speech at the Congress of the 
League of Peace and Freedom since Marx's opponents claimed that Marx was the 
virtual author of this speech, which could damage his prestige as a serious 
researcher and the author of Volume One of Capital.—449 
506 In his letter of 7 October 1867 addressed to Jenny Marx, Johann Philipp 
Becker told Marx about his strained circumstances, which was why he 
contemplated giving up his post as Chairman of the Central Committee of the 
German-language sections in Geneva and leaving the Vorbote editorial board.

With the help of his friends Becker managed to cope with the difficulties and 
continue his public activity.—450 
507 On 14 October 1867, in the discussion in the North German Reichstag of the 
bill on the abrogation of the anti-coalition legislation which had been submitted 
by Schulze-Delitzsch, Schweitzer made a long demagogical speech. Although he 
did support the bill, he held a Lassallean stance denying the importance of 
strikes and coalitions in the workers' struggle against capitalist exploitation. He 
also made an attempt to expound some tenets of Marx's political economy but 
he did so in a primitive and distorted way. A report on Schweitzer's speech was 
published in Der Social-Demokrat, Nos. 122 and 123 of 16 and 18 October 
1867.—450 
508 The reference is probably to clippings from the Hermann which carried reports 
of the London committee for raising money for Freiligrath (see Note 422), in 
particular from the final address of the committee published in No. 459 of 
19 October 1867. On this clipping which has been preserved among his papers 
Marx wrote a saying widespread in the Rhineland: 'If that's not champion drivel, I 
don't know what is.'—454 
509 Engels wrote the review of Volume One of Marx's Capital for The Fortnightly 
Review much later, in May and June 1868. As can be seen from their 
subsequent correspondence, Marx and Engels exchanged opinions several times 
on the content and form of the article. 
In spite of Professor Beesly's request, the review was rejected by the 
editorial board and has only been preserved in manuscript form (see present 
edition, Vol. 20).—455, 457, 463, 466, 512, 516, 518, 524, 526, 532, 533, 545, 
555,  560, 583 
510 In his letter to Marx of 14 October 1867 Eccarius told him that he and his 
family were hard-up. For his active work for the International he had been 
black-listed by his employers and was out of work. 
For Becker's difficult financial circumstances see Note 506.—455 
511 On 26 May 1849, in the discussion of the drafts for an Appeal to the German 
people in the Frankfurt National Assembly, W. Wolff made a vivid speech 
exposing the enemies of the revolution and the indefinite conciliatory stand of 
the liberals and moderate democrats. He described the Imperial Regent, 
Archduke John, as the betrayer of the people. The chairman hurriedly called 
him to order.—456 
512 On 17 October 1867, during a discussion of the conscription bill in the North 
German Reichstag, Liebknecht, Bebel and others proposed that the standing 
armies should be abolished and the arming of the people substituted for them. 
In his speech Liebknecht described the North German Reichstag as 'the fig-leaf 
of absolutism'. 
In the course of a discussion of the coalition bill in the North German 
Reichstag on 19 October 1867 (see Note 507), Liebknecht, Bebel and others 
submitted an amendment to Section 2 of the bill which would entitle the 
employer to hire workers of any trade and in any numbers; the amendment 
also proposed that Section 2 should not abrogate the laws on the limitation and 
protection of child labour at factories. The amendment was adopted by the 
Reichstag.—456

the country would be completed if the Papal States were to be incorporated.

Garibaldi was the initiator of the struggle for their annexation. At first Victor 
Emmanuel's government turned a blind eye to his preparations for a march on 
Rome, but it suddenly arrested Garibaldi on the eve of the march. However, 
his volunteers did invade the Papal States and the patriots in Rome began to 
prepare an uprising against the Pope. On 18 October 1867, the government of 
Napoleon III promised its assistance to Pius IX and with this aim in view began 
to prepare an expeditionary corps to be sent to Italy. When Garibaldi (he 
escaped from under arrest on 14 October) and his men were on the 
approaches to Rome, the French corps sailed off for Italy and on 30 October 
marched into Rome. It was only with the help of the French interventionist 
forces that the Papal army was able to defeat Garibaldi's volunteers at Mentana 
on 3 November 1867. The Roman question remained unsettled till 1870.—457, 
459, 468, 496 
514 The laws of primogeniture and entail—feudal inheritance laws that were still in 
force in Britain in the 19th century. In accordance with them, the title and land 
were to be inherited by the elder son without the right of alienation.—458 
515 A reference to the letter to Marx from the secretary of the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London (see Note 150) Carl Speyer of 6 October 1867. 
Speyer thanked Marx, on behalf of the society, for sending Volume One of 
Capital.—459 
516 Atheistic societies of freethinkers became very active in Britain in the 1860s. 
Considerable influence on this movement was exercised by Charles Bradlaugh 
and other bourgeois radicals who grouped round The National Reformer and 
disseminated reformist ideas among the workers. In October 1867 a group of 
freethinkers, who thought the influence of Bradlaugh and those who were 
close to him burdensome, decided to convoke a conference in order to create a 
Central Association of Freethinkers for purely atheistic propaganda. Marx was 
also invited to join the preparatory committee for the conference but he 
declined the proposal.—459 
517 Marx ironically uses here Karl Vogt's expression from his book Mein Prozeß 
gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung, Geneva, 1859 (see K. Marx, Herr Vogt, present 
edition, Vol. 17, p. 72).—459 
518 The Franco-Italian agreement of 15 September 1864 guaranteed the inviolabili­
ty of the Papal States and envisaged the withdrawal of the French forces 
brought there during the revolution of 1848-49 in Italy. In the autumn of 
1867,  when Garibaldi's detachments invaded the Papal States (see Note 513), 
secret negotiations for a revision of the September 1864 agreement began 
between the Kingdom of Italy and France, which, however, came to nothing. In 
connection with these negotiations Bismarck gave instructions in October 1867 
to the Prussian ambassador to Florence, Count of Usedom, ordering him to 
maintain an observer's attitude in the Franco-Italian conflict and mark 
time.—460, 466 
519 Marx is referring to the meeting between Napoleon III and Emperor Francis 
Joseph of Austria in Salzburg on 18 August 1867. Napoleon III tried to 
negotiate an agreement with Austria directed against Prussia and Russia. 
However, due to the mutual distrust of the parties and Austria's unwillingness 
to get into a new conflict with Prussia, the agreement was not concluded.—460

1867,  on the anniversary of the Franco-Italian agreement of 15 September

1864,  guaranteeing the inviolability of the Papal States to the Italian Prime 
Minister Rattazzi calling upon him to fight Garibaldi's movement for their 
annexation to Italy. In a few days the letter was published in La Gazette de 
France and soon afterwards as a separate booklet entitled Lettre à M. Rattazzi, 
président du conseil des ministres du roi d'Italie, sur les enterprises de Garibaldi, Paris, 
1867.—460 
521 The meeting of the Reform League's Council (see Note 155) on 23 October 
1867 discussed a letter of the Chairman of the League, Edmond Beales in 
which he vigorously condemned the Fenian movement. George Odger and 
Benjamin Lucraft, trade union leaders and members of the League's Council, 
objected to its publication and sympathised with the Irish liberation movement. 
This was the effect of the internationalist influence exercised by Marx and his 
close followers in the General Council of the International on trade union 
leaders. However, at subsequent meetings of the League's Council, those on 
30 October and 1 November, Odger and Lucraft, under pressure from 
bourgeois radicals, renounced their former stance announcing that they had 
been misunderstood.—460

F. Engels, Ireland and the Irish Question, Progress Publishers, Moscow,  1971.— 
461, 463, 467, 474, 483, 505, 549 
523 It is obvious from Kugelmann's correspondence as well as from Engels' letters 
to Marx of 10 November and 12 December (see this volume, pp. 470, 498) that 
Kugelmann sent this second review of Volume One of Capital to Heinrich 
Bürgers, a former member of the Communist League and an editor of the 
Rheinische Zeitung. Bürgers refused to publish it saying in his reply to 
Kugelmann of 4 November 1867 that, in his opinion, this work was purely 
academic and unfit for practical purposes of agitation. Bürgers believed that 
the level of the workers' consciousness was quite low and that therefore they 
were unable to understand Capital; he also disputed the idea expressed in the 
review by Engels that Capital would become the 'theoretical Bible' of the 
Social-Democratic Party.—462, 469, 471 
524 On 1 November 1867, Moustier, the Foreign Minister of France, sent the 
Italian government a Note to the effect that the French government could by 
no means agree to the Italian intervention in the Papal States. On 4 November 
the French newspaper La Presse carried a report claiming that Napoleon III 
had given an ultimatum to the Italian government demanding the withdrawal 
of its troops from the Papal States. However, next day the report was 
refuted.—462 
525 On All Saints' Day, 1 November 1867, a demonstration of supporters of Italy's 
independence and French republicans took place at Montmartre Cemetery in 
Paris.  Wreaths were laid on the graves of the Italian patriot Daniele Manin and the 
French republican Godefroy Cavaignac. The police arrested some of the 
demonstrators.—462 
526 A reference to the joint statement which was made by Russia, France, Prussia 
and Italy and sent to the Turkish government on 29 October 1867. The 
statement called upon Turkey to put an end to the violence against the 
population of Crete perpetrated by the Turkish troops who were suppressing 
the national liberation uprising (see also Note 460).—465 
527 This note by Marx and the postscript from his daughter Laura were written on 
Kugelmann's letter to Marx of 6 November 1867.—470

528 In looking for ways to publish reviews of Volume One of Marx's Capital, 
Ludwig Kugelmann applied for help to the lawyer Ernst Warnebold who, as it 
turned out later, was one of Bismarck's informers, and the National-Liberal 
Johannes Miquel; both of them were prejudiced against proletarian re­
volutionaries.—471,  482 
529 Engels' review of Volume One of Capital which was written for the Frankfurter 
Zeitung und Handelsblatt has not been found. 
The review for the Düsseldorfer Zeitung, was published unsigned, with Carl 
Siebel's assistance, in No. 316 of 16 November 1867 (see present edition, 
Vol. 20).—471,  529, 532, 534, 536, 537 
530 The Barmer Zeitung of 6 December 1867 carried a short review by Carl Siebel 
of Volume One of Capital, signed 'S'. Engels' review, which he had given to 
Siebel, was sent by Siebel, judging by his letter to Engels of 13 November 1867, 
not to the Barmer Zeitung but to the Rhein- und Ruhrzeitung in Duisburg. Its 
text has not been found.—471 
531 The original of this letter, which was written by Marx on the copy of Volume 
One of Capital that he presented to Carl Siebel, is now not in the possession of the 
Institute of Marxism-Leninism.—472 
532 A reference to the letter to Marx, dated 24 October 1867, from Joseph 
Dietzgen, a German self-taught philosopher then living in St. Petersburg and 
working at a tannery. He spoke highly of Marx's merits both before 
science and the working class and wrote about the deep impression Volume One 
of Capital had made on him and about his acquaintance with some of the earlier 
works by Marx, particularly A Contribution  to the Critique of Political Economy. In his 
letter Dietzgen also outlined the basis of his own materialist world outlook. The 
letter was the beginning of a friendship between its author and Marx and Engels. 
From Solingen Marx received a letter from Karl Klein dated 8 November 
1867;  he informed Marx about the activities of the local section of the 
International.—473, 497 
533 On 16 October 1859 John Brown, a fighter for the emancipation of the 
Negroes in the United States, made an attempt to start a slave uprising. With a 
small detachment of his supporters he captured the state armoury in Harpers 
Ferry, Virginia. Brown's attempt to engage more people in the uprising failed. 
Almost all the participants in the uprising (22 people, five of whom were 
Negroes) who put up a stiff resistance to the government forces were killed. 
Brown and five of his comrades were executed.—474 
534 In 1840, during an abortive attempt to carry out a coup d'état in Boulogne, 
Louis Bonaparte shot and wounded a government army officer.—474 
635 Enclosed with his letter of 19 November 1867, Otto Meissner sent Marx two 
clippings (from unidentified newspapers) with new notices on the publication of 
Volume One of Capital. One of the notices enumerated the main points of the 
volume, the other gave an excerpt from Engels' review of Volume One that 
had been published in Die Zukunft, No. 254 (Supplement) of 30 October 1867 
(see present edition, Vol. 20).—475

Workers' Party was also published in this newspaper, No. 27 of 3 March 
1865.—475 
537 Appended to the pamphlet containing Wilhelm Liebknecht's speech in the 
North German Reichstag on 30 September 1867 (see Note 486) was a report 
of his speeches before workers in Berlin on 14 and 15 October which had 
been published in Die Zukunft, No. 242 (Supplement) of 16 October 1867. In 
these speeches Liebknecht said that to put forward the social question in the 
given situation was inexpedient because premature attempts to solve it could, in 
his opinion, only serve to strengthen the absolute monarchy and delay the 
victory of socialist principles. 
In his letter to Marx of 23 November 1867, Ludwig Kugelmann criticised 
Liebknecht's point of view, emphasising that in practice this would give such 
people as the Lassallean Schweitzer and the conservative Wagener complete 
control over the social issue and the possibility of using it for demagogical 
aims.—477, 479, 488, 492, 499 
538 A reference to the German workers' newspaper Demokratisches Wochenblatt 
which appeared in Leipzig from January 1868 and was edited by Liebknecht. 
Initially the newspaper was to some extent influenced by the petty-bourgeois 
People's Party; however, thanks to the assistance given it by Marx and Engels it 
soon came to play an active part in the development of the proletarian 
movement in Germany, spreading the ideas of the International and promoting 
the preparations for forming the Social-Democratic Workers' Party.—477, 479, 
484 
539 In his letter to Marx of 27 November 1867, Victor Schily informed him about 
Moses Hess' favourable opinion of Capital and the latter's intention to write an 
article about it for Le Courrier français. Schily also wrote about Hess' offer to 
translate, together with Elysée Reclus, Volume One of Capital into French and 
to publish it. Marx who attached great importance to the publication of Capital 
in French and saw this in particular as an important weapon against the 
influence of Proudhon's delusions (see this volume, p. 368) did not object to 
Reclus' participation in the French edition. However, the discussion which 
lasted for almost three years came to nothing. Later on, when it became clear 
that Reclus was one of the leaders of Bakunin's Alliance of Socialist Democracy, 
he could no longer be considered as a suitable translator of Capital. The 
translation of Capital into French which had been done by Joseph Roy and 
edited by Marx himself was published in Paris in 1872-75 by instalments.—478, 
483,  488, 490, 528, 532, 533, 580 
540 This was written by Marx on Kugelmann's letter to Engels of 25 November 
1867.—482 
541 The letter was published in English for the first time in the Labour Monthly, 
No. 11, London, 1932.—484 
542 A reference to the address entitled 'The Fenian Prisoners at Manchester and 
the International Working Men's Association' which was written by Marx and 
approved by the special meeting of the General Council on 20 November 1867 
(see present edition, Vol. 21). The document which was sent to the Home 
Secretary Gathorne-Hardy became an important part of the campaign 
organised by Marx in the autumn of 1867, for solidarity of the English workers 
with the Irish national liberation movement. The immediate aim of the address 
was to prevent the execution of the Fenians on whom the Manchester court 
had passed the death penalty (see Note 497).—485

543 At the meeting of the International's General Council of 5 November 1867 
Peter Fox announced his intention of leaving his post as corresponding 
secretary for America and take a paid job at The Bee-Hive Newspaper. Hermann 
Jung, chairman of the meeting, condemned Fox's intention. Fox sent a letter to 
the next meeting which was held on 12 November reaffirming his resignation 
and accusing Jung of his alleged wish to remove Englishmen from the Council. 
All those present at the meeting supported Jung.—485 
544 The draft resolution that had been proposed by Peter Fox read: 'That this 
meeting desires that a setded peace and amity between the British and the Irish 
nations should be substituted for the war of seven hundred years between 
Englishry and Irishry; and with a view to that end this meeting exhorts the 
friends of Irish nationality to bring their cause before the British people and 
advises the latter to accord an unprejudiced hearing to the arguments 
advanced on behalf of Ireland's right to autonomy'  ( The General Council of the 
First International. 1866-1868. Minutes, Progress Publishers, Moscow, p. 181). 
The draft was referred to the Standing Committee for consideration and for 
that reason it had not been adopted by the General Council.—486 
545 The Corn Laws, which imposed high import duties for corn in Great Britain 
and which had been introduced in order to meet the interests of large 
landowners, were repealed in 1846. 
From 1845 to 1847 a grievous famine blighted Ireland due to the ruin of 
farms and the pauperisation of the peasants, who were cruelly exploited by the 
English landlords. This had been caused by the almost total failure of the 
potato crop (potatoes were the principal diet of the Irish peasants). About a 
million people starved to death and the new wave of emigration caused by the 
famine carried away another million. As a result, large districts of Ireland were 
depopulated and the abandoned land was turned into pastures by the Irish and 
English landlords.—486 
546 In 1849 Parliament passed the Encumbered Estates Act for Ireland, which was 
supplemented with a series of other acts in 1852 and 1853. The Act of 1849 
provided for the sale of mortgaged estates by auction if their owners were 
proved to be insolvent. As a result, the estates of many ruined landlords passed 
into the hands of usurers, middlemen and rich tenants.—486 
547 The reference is probably to the speech by Thomas Francis Meagher at a 
meeting in Dublin convoked on 15 March 1848 by the Irish Confederation. He 
said: 'If you do not give us a parliament in which to state our wrongs and 
grievances, we shall state them by arms and force.'—486 
548 The upsurge of the Irish national movement caused by Britain's defeat in the 
War of Independence of the American colonies, forced the British Parliament 
in 1782 to pass an act which abolished the right of the British Parliament to 
pass laws for Ireland and granted this right to the Irish Parliament. The act 
was once more confirmed in 1783 in the form of a new 'Renunciation Act', 
which meant Irish autonomy in legislation. However, after the Irish national 
liberation rising of 1798 had been suppressed, the British government virtually 
nullified these concessions to Ireland by imposing on it a union with England. 
The Act of Union which came into force on 1 January 1801 put an end to the 
remnants of Irish autonomy and abolished the Irish Parliament. One of its 
consequences was the abolition of the protective tariffs for the emerging Irish 
industry which had been introduced by the Irish Parliament in the late 18th 
century; this led to a total decline of the national industry.—486

649 Marx apparendy did not make a speech on the Irish question in the General 
Council as planned. In December 1867, the Council met twice, on the 17th and 
31st, and from January 1868, illness prevented Marx from attending the 
Council meetings for several months. His view of the Irish question, which 
reflected the position of the revolutionary proletarian wing of the General 
Council, was set forth in the detailed report he made on 16 December in the 
German Workers' Educational Society in London (see present edition, 
Vol. 21).—487 
550 A reference to the sections of the first German edition of Volume One of 
Capital. They are given as chapters VIII, XI, XII, XIII and XXIV in the 
second and subsequent German editions of this volume, and as chapters X, 
XIII, XIV, XV and XXVI in the English edition of 1887 (see present edition, 
Vol. 35).—490 
551 A reference to Ludwig Kugelmann's letters to Marx of 23 November and to 
Engels of 25 November (with enclosed reprints of Kugelmann's note on 
Volume One of Capital in the Deutsche Volkszeitung) and of 30 November 1867, 
and to Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter to Engels of 26 November 1867. In seeking 
to persuade German economists and philosophers to respond to Marx's book, 
Kugelmann sent reprints of his own and Engels' (from Die Zukunft) reviews of 
it to Faucher, Schulze-Delitzsch, Dühring, Röscher, Hildebrand and Rau, about 
which he told Marx in his letter of 23 November 1867.—492 
552 Engels' letter to Liebknecht mentioned here has not been found. In his reply to 
this letter of 11 December 1867, Liebknecht said that he agreed with Engels' 
remarks on the policy pursued by the working-class representatives in Germany 
but that he had a different opinion on individual practical questions of 
agitation. In particular, he explained the reason for the address that he and 
Bebel had sent to the Vienna City Council by their confidence that Austria was 
on the eve of a revolution ('She has to experience her own 1789'), which was to 
have an impact on the whole of Germany.—492, 499, 503, 504 
553 On 4 November 1867 Adelaide Macdonald who supported the Fenians made 
an attempt on the life of a policeman guarding the house of a witness at the 
Fenian trial in Manchester (see Note 497) who had given evidence against 
William Allen. She was arrested, put on trial and sentenced to five years' penal 
servitude.—492 
554 with his letter to Marx of 3 December 1867 Ludwig Kugelmann enclosed his 
correspondence with Heinrich Bürgers (see Note 523).—493, 498 
555 Engels fully accepted the draft of a review of Volume One of Capital for Der 
Beobachter that is being set out here by Marx and also used this letter in writing 
the review. The review was then published, with Kugelmann's assistance, in Der 
Beobachter, No. 303 of 27 December 1867, unsigned (see present edition, 
Vol. 20). 
The passage Marx mentions here is in a special additional note to Section 1 
of Chapter VI in the first German edition of Volume One of Capital, at the 
end of the book. Marx deleted this note when preparing the second German 
edition (1872).—494 
556 ln  his letter to Marx of 26 November 1867, Wilhelm Liebknecht told him that 
he had the opportunity to make use of several German newspapers such as Die 
Zukunft, Volksleitung (Hanover), Oberrheinischer Courier (Freiburg im Breisgau), 
Neue Baseler Zeitung, Correspondent (Leipzig), Süddeutsche Presse and Deutsche 
Arbeiterhalle (Mannheim). —495

557 A reference to No. 139 of Der Social-Demokrat of 29 November 1867 with its 
two supplements which carried a detailed report about the general meeting of 
the General Association of German Workers on 24 November 1867. Among 
the speakers was one of the publishers of Der Social-Demokrat, the Lassallean 
J. B. von Hofstetten, who included in his speech passages from Capital 
distorting their meaning and naming neither the work nor its author. Marx 
responded to this with an article, 'Plagiarism', which was published unsigned in 
Die Zukunft, No. 291 (Supplement) of 12 December 1867 (see present edition, 
Vol. 20). 
The mentioned letter of Marx to Guido Weiß, the editor of Die Zukunft , has 
not been found.—495, 496 
558 A reference to Section 4 of Chapter III of the first edition of Volume One of 
Capital. It is given as Chapter VIII of Part III in the second and 
subsequent German editions and Chapter X of the English edition of 1887 (see 
present edition, Vol. 35).—495 
559 ln  his letter to Marx of 1 December 1867, Kugelmann asked whether 
Borkheim could make arrangements through his friend Lothar Bucher for the 
publication of Engels' review of Volume One of Capital in the Norddeutsche 
Allgemeine Zeitung. Since the newspaper was a semi-official mouthpiece of the 
Bismarck government, Kugelmann's offer was unacceptable to Marx and 
Engels.— 497, 498 
560 In his letter to Engels of 30 November 1867, Kugelmann asked him to write 
several reviews of Volume One of Capital by Marx. Kugelmann was going to 
arrange for their publication with the help of Lieutenant-Colonel Seubert, a 
writer and an official of the Württemberg War Ministry, to whose daughter he 
was giving treatment. Seubert promised his assistance in getting the reviews 
published in such newspapers as Der Beobachter,  Staats-Anzeiger für Württemberg 
and Schwäbischer Merkur. For the first two Engels wrote reviews.—499, 
510, 512 
561 A reference to a legal action of the Schulze & Siebenmark firm against a woman 
home-worker accused of concealing wool. During the trial which took place in 
Berlin late in 1867, the employers' shady practices were brought to light: they 
provided their home-workers with dampened wool that lost weight while being 
processed, for which the workers were heavily fined by the firm. The case was 
given great publicity.—501 
562 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in the Labour 
Monthly, No. 11, London, 1932.—501, 504 
563 On 13 December 1867 a group of Fenians caused an explosion in Clerkenwell 
Prison in London, their aim being to free the imprisoned Fenian leaders. The 
attempt failed, but the blast destroyed several neighbouring houses, a few 
people were killed and over a hundred wounded. The British bourgeois press 
took advantage of this to spread slanderous fabrications about the Irish 
national liberation movement and whip up chauvinistic anti-Irish sentiments 
among the English population.—501, 505 
564 In his letter to Engels of 10 December 1867, Carl Siebel suggested that Otto 
Meissner should present Friedrich Albert Lange, a well-known philosopher, 
sociologist and democrat, with a copy of Volume One of Capital by Marx.—502

December 1867 at a meeting of the German Workers' Educational Society in

workers' societies of London as well as some members of the General Council.

handwritten record of it by Eccarius (see present edition, Vol. 21) have come

566 The  Cvstoms Union Parliament was the guiding body of the Customs Union 
which was reorganised after the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the signing 
of a treaty between Prussia and South German states on 8 July 1867. The 
parliament consisted of members of the North German Confederation's 
Reichstag and specially elected deputies from the South German states— 
Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hesse. It was to deal exclusively with 
problems of trade and customs policy; Bismarck's attempts to widen its 
jurisdiction met with the stubborn resistance of South German representa­
tives.—505 
567 On 6 December 1867 the Bismarck government submitted to the Prussian 
Chamber of Deputies draft treaties of compensation to be made to the King of 
Hanover and the Duke of Nassau whose possessions were annexed by Prussia 
after the 1866 Austro-Prussian war. In order to gain support from the 
Chamber, the government dismissed the unpopular Minister of Justice Lippe 
who had given Bismarck active help in carrying out his anti-constitutional 
measures, and appointed in his place Gerhardt Leonhardt, the former Minister 
of Justice for Hanover. Bismarck's calculations proved correct: the Prussian 
Chamber of Deputies approved the compensation treaties, thus sanctioning 
annexation of Hanover and Nassau.—506 
668 A reference to Engels' reviews of Volume One of Capital. Engels intended to 
send them to Meissner so that he could compose and publish an advertisement 
of Marx's work.—507, 509 
569 Ground rent is dealt with in Volume Three of Capital (present edition, 
Vol. 37).—508 
570 A reference to Jenny Marx's letter to Engels of 23 December 1867 in which she 
thanked him for the wine he had sent them for Christmas and informed him 
about the state of Marx's health. She also told Engels about the popularisation 
of Volume One of Capital in Germany and about his reviews which played an 
important role in this campaign.—508 
571 On 13 November 1867 Carl Siebel wrote to Engels that he had sent Engels' 
review, which had formerly been intended for publication in the Banner 
Zeitung, to another newspaper, whereas he had sent to the Banner Zeitung a 
short item on the subject that he had written himself (see Note 530). In 
another letter to Engels on 20 December 1867 Siebel enclosed a clipping from 
the Banner Zeitung with his item, published on 6 December 1867. 
In both letters Siebel suggested that the publication of a review of Volume 
One of Capital should be arranged in the Kölnische Zeitung with Meissner's 
assistance; he also named one of the contributors to the paper as a possible 
author of the review.—509 
572 As Jenny Marx told Engels in her letter of 23 December 1867, the Lassallean 
J. B. von Hofstetten's answer to the article 'Plagiarism' (see Note 557) appeared 
in Die Zukunft on 18 December. Since 'Plagiarism' had been published 
anonymously, Hofstetten did not suspect that it had been written by Marx 
himself and ascribed the authorship to Liebknecht. —509, 529

573 In a letter addressed to Marx's daughter Jenny of 3 January 1868, Liebknecht 
said that he would like to ask Marx what he thought of his possible removal 
from Leipzig to Vienna.— 512 
574 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in the Labour 
Monthly, Vol. 5, No. 3, London, 1923.—514 
575 A reference to the section 'The So-Called Primitive Accumulation' of Chapter 
VI of the first German edition of Volume One of Capital. This section 
is given as Chapter XXIV, Part VII of the second and subsequent German 
editions and Chapter XXVI, Part VIII of the English edition of 1887 (present 
edition, Vol. 35).—514 
576 A reference to the prospects for the distribution of Volume One of Capital in 
Austria, where an upsurge of the labour and national movement made itself 
clear in those years. This had been caused by the crisis of the Austrian absolute 
monarchy aggravated by the defeat of the Habsburgs in the Austro-Prussian 
war of 1866. This situation compelled Austria's ruling circles to reorganise in 
1867 the empire into the dual state of Austria-Hungary and introduce a 
constitution which guaranteed certain bourgeois freedoms and provided for 
bourgeois reforms.—515 
577 A reference to the help Marx gave Liebknecht when he was the London 
correspondent of the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung, i.e. from 1855 until 1862, 
when he moved to Berlin.—515 
578 After his return from London to Germany in 1862, Wilhelm Liebknecht was at 
one time a member of the editorial board of the Berlin Norddeutsche Allgemeine 
Zeitung. Initially this was an opposition newspaper but after the formation of 
Bismarck's government it began to turn into its mouthpiece. When Liebknecht 
realised this, he left the newspaper.—516 
579 Among the papers seized by the French police during the searches in the 
homes of members of the Paris Administration of the sections of the 
International late in 1867 was a letter to Murât, a member of the Paris 
Administration, from Eugene Dupont, the Corresponding Secretary of the 
General Council for France, of 23 November 1867. The letter informed the 
French members of the International about the campaign in support of the 
Fenian prisoners (see Note 542). The French authorities tried to use this letter 
to accuse the International of complicity in a Fenian plot. At a trial of the Paris 
Administration members which took place in March 1868, they were accused of 
forming an association without the sanction of the authorities. The court 
declared the Paris Section of the International disbanded and fined the Paris 
Administration members.—516, 520 
580 A reference to the numerous articles by Engels in which he analysed the 
military operations during the siege and defence of Sevastopol and which were 
amongst his reports on the Crimean war of 1853-56 (present edition, 
vols 12-14), and to the series of articles he wrote about the progress of the 
Austro-Prussian war of 1866, 'Notes on the War in Germany' (see present 
edition, Vol. 20).—517 
581 The expression 'treat like a dead dog' was first used by Gotthold Ephraim 
Lessing to describe the attitude of some of his contemporaries to Spinoza's 
philosophy. Hegel mentioned it in the Foreword to the second edition of his

582 Forestalling the General Council one of whose duties was to prepare the annual 
congresses of the International, the Paris Administration published in Le 
Courrier français on 11 December 1867 the programme for the next congress to 
be held in Brussels. This programme which was markedly Proudhonist in 
character would take away the congress' attention from urgent issues of the 
working-class organisation. 
At the General Council meeting of 21 January 1868 the agenda of the 
Brussels Congress was approved. In spite of the efforts of the Proudhonists, 
this programme outlined the ways of further consolidating the international 
workers' organisation on the platform of proletarian socialism.—520 
583 Marx was in Berlin from 17 March to 12 April 1861; he discussed starting a 
joint newspaper in Germany with Lassalle; he also made unsuccessful efforts to 
restore his Prussian citizenship (see Note 154).—520, 531 
584 A reference to the moderate liberal interpretation of the popular demand for 
the repeal of the Anglo-Irish Union of 1801 which deprived Ireland of the 
right to have an autonomous parliament (see Note 548). Some of the leaders of 
the Association of Repealers (i.e. supporters of the abolition of the Union), 
which had been founded in 1840, such as D. O'Connell regarded agitation for 
this demand merely as a means to obtain individual privileges for the Irish 
propertied classes from the British government; they wanted Ireland to be a 
country with limited self-government within the United Kingdom. A similar 
stand was taken by their successors, the liberal wing of the Irish national 
movement in the 1850s and 1860s, in contrast to the Irish radicals—the 
Fenians—who sought to establish true independence for their country.—521 
585 A reference to a copy of a bust of Zeus from Ogricoli which was presented to 
Marx by Kugelmann. —521, 578 
586 A reference to the letter to Engels from Liebknecht of 20 January 1868, in 
which Liebknecht told Engels that, while sharing his critical attitude towards the 
petty-bourgeois South-German People's Party and the League of Peace and 
Freedom, he nevertheless did not believe it possible to break with them for 
tactical reasons. Liebknecht also informed Engels about the steps he had taken 
for the popularisation of Volume One of Capital.—525, 527 
587 Engels' project was not fulfilled.—526 
588 A reference to the letter from Kugelmann to Marx of 17-18 January 1868 with 
which a letter was enclosed to Marx from a Hungarian writer, Kâroly Marie 
Kertbény. In his letter Kugelmann said that Kertbény had seen him in Hanover 
and showed an interest in the members of the revolutionary movement. 
Kugelmann asked Marx to tell him what he thought of Kertbény and also to 
receive a young banker from Hanover, Karl Coppel, who was going to London. 
Judging by the letter from Kertbény to Marx of 17 January 1868, he wanted to 
publish in the Leipzig Illustrierte Zeitung a short biographical note about Marx 
and a portrait of him on the occasion of the release of Volume One of Capital. 
Kertbény discovered this portrait by chance in the studio of a photographer in 
Hanover and asked Marx to send biographical details. Kertbény's project was 
not fulfilled.—527, 529, 531, 533, 536

according to the copy in Kugelmann's hand.—530 
591 A reference to the lectures Marx delivered in the latter half of December 
1847 at meetings of the German Workers' Society in Brussels. Early in 1848 he 
made an attempt to publish in Brussels a work that he had written on the basis 
of these lectures but was unable to do this because of his expulsion from the 
country. This work was first published in part as editorials in the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung on 5-8 and 11 April 1849 under the general heading of Wage 
Labour and Capital (see present edition, Vol. 9). The publication of the 
editorials was first interrupted by Marx's temporary departure from Cologne 
and later because the newspaper ceased to exist. 
The German Workers' Society was founded by Marx and Engels at the end of 
August 1847 in Brussels, its aim being the political education of the German 
workers who lived in Belgium and the spread of the ideas of scientific 
communism among them. With Marx, Engels and their followers at its head, 
the Society became the legally sanctioned centre rallying the revolutionary 
proletarian forces in Belgium. Its best activists were members of the 
Communist League. It ceased to exist soon after the February revolution of 
1848 in France when the Belgian police arrested and banished many of its 
members.—530 
592 Marx's pamphlet Lord Palmerston (see present edition, Vol. 12) was first 
published as a series of articles in The People's Paper, Nos.  77-81,  84-86 of 22 
and 29 October, 5, 12 and 19 November and 10, 17 and 24 December 1853, 
signed by Dr Marx; in part it was published as editorials in the New-York Daily 
Tribune, Nos. 3902, 3916, 3930 and 3973 of 19 October, 4 and 21 November 
1853 and 11 January 1854. 
Some articles of this series were published in London in 1853 and 1854 in 
pamphlet form under the headings: Palmerston and Russia and Palmerston and 
the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessy.—531

Armies of Europe (see present edition, Vol. 14) in Putnam's Monthly. A Magazine

1855;  Marx also helped Engels in collecting information on various European 
armies, in particular the Spanish and the Neapolitan, at the British Museum 
Library.

that had been printed in Les États-Unis d'Europe at the beginning of 1868; the 
fourth article of the series (published in No. 7 of 16 February) dealt with the 
South German military system.—534, 540

émigré in the United States who had taken part in the Civil War of 1861-65 
and the editor of the newspaper Die Westliche Post, in January 1868 in Berlin. 
Schurz assured Bismarck that Napoleon III did not enjoy any popularity in 
America, and should Germany be drawn into a war with France, the United 
States would not support him. Marx and Engels satirised the earlier period of 
Schurz' activity in their pamphlet The Great Men of the Exile (see present 
edition, Vol. 11).—537 
601 A reference to the forthcoming marriage between Marx's daughter Laura and 
Paul Lafargue, whose parents lived in Bordeaux; the wedding was in the early 
April 1868.—538, 544, 548, 551 
602 At Marx's request, Engels wrote a detailed review of Volume One of Capital 
for the Demokratisches Wochenblatt in the first half of March; it was published in 
it unsigned, as two articles, in Nos. 12 and 13 of 21 and 28 March 1868 (see 
present edition, Vol. 20).—539, 540, 542 
603 A reference to an article by Moses Hess about Volume One of Capital which he 
had started as early as November 1867 and intended to publish in the French 
press (see Note 539). In 1868 for several months, he made attempts to publish 
it in various papers, including Le Courrier français and Morale indépendante. Its 
further fate is unknown.—542 
604 A reference to newspaper reports of lectures 'The Causes of Modern Trade 
Crises' read by Wilhelm Eichhoff from February to May 1868 in Berlin. These 
reports were published in Die Zukunft and the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. In 
his lectures Eichhoff quoted from Marx's Capital and the Manifesto of the 
Communist Party by Marx and Engels. —542, 545 
605 A reference to a report in The Times of 3 March 1868 that the Russian 
government had instructed its representatives in Turkey and in the Balkans to 
make every effort to refrain from conflicts with Turkey.—545 
606 Engels sent Marx a letter from an Austrian journalist, W. Angerstein, dated 9 
March 1868, in which he invited Engels to become a correspondent of a new 
workers' newspaper. On 11 March 1868, Angerstein sent a similar letter to 
Marx whom he invited to contribute to the Viennese newspapers Telegraph and 
Arbeiter-Zeitung. —546, 548 
607 Engels' letter to Liebknecht has not been found. From Liebknecht's reply of 29 
March 1868 it follows that his friends and he readily took Engels' advice to use 
Capital as a basis for the proletarian stance vis-à-vis a new crafts and 
manufactures code that was being prepared (the same was recommended in his 
review of Volume One of Capital for the Demokratisches Wochenblatt). When, in 
the spring of 1869, the North German Reichstag began to discuss the code bill, 
August Bebel and other working-class deputies, following Engels' advice,

Notes 673 
resolutely criticised the bill and demanded that several amendments should be 
introduced into it that would meet the interests of the working class such as a 
ten-hour working day, the abolition of work on Sundays, the introduction of a 
factory inspectorate and the workers' right to coalitions. Although all these 
amendments were rejected by the bourgeois and Junker majority of the 
Reichstag, the speeches of the working-class deputies on this issue played an 
important part to unite the revolutionary efforts of the German proletariat.— 
546 
608 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in Karl Marx, 
Pre-capitalist Economic Formations, Lawrence & Wishart, London, 1964.—547 
609 This standpoint was expressed by Marx in 1859 in his A Contribution to the 
Critique of Political Economy (see present edition, Vol. 29) and also in Volume 
One of Capital (Vol. 35).—547 
610 On 13 March 1868 Sigismund Borkheim informed Marx about Diihring's new 
book, Die Schicksale meiner socialen Denkschrift für das  preussische  Staatsministerium, 
in which he accused Hermann Wagener of plagiarism.—548 
611 A reference to Article 11 of the French law on the press a draft of which was 
submitted to the Corps législatif by a group of deputies, Jean Dollfus included, 
on 11 February 1868. It was passed on 6 March 1868 and read as follows: 'Any 
publication in a periodical that may concern a fact of private life shall be an 
offence which shall be punished with a fine of 500 francs.'—550, 553 
612 The publisher of The Irishman, Richard Pigott, and the owner of The Weekly 
News, Alexander Sullivan, were sentenced in 1867 and 1868 to various terms of 
imprisonment for the publication of articles in defence of the Fenians.—550 
613 This is a quotation from the first German edition of Volume One of Capital 
(pp. 255 and 565 in the English edition of 1887).—552 
614 A reference to the medical school at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.— 
553 
615 Marx gives below an excerpt from Lex Baiuvariorum, X, 18—the code of com­
mon law of the Germanic tribe of Bavars, dating back to the 8th century.— 
553 
616 Leges barbarorum (laws of the barbarians)—written records of the customary law 
of various Germanic tribes compiled between the 5th and 9th centuries.—558 
617 Engels came to see Marx in London on 1 April 1868 in order to be present at 
the wedding of Paul Lafargue and Laura Marx; he stayed there till 5 
April.—560 
618 Straubingers —German travelling journeymen. Marx and Engels applied the 
name ironically to some participants in the German working-class movement of 
the time who were connected with guild-based production and displayed 
petty-bourgeois sectarian tendencies. 
The reference here is to the members of the Lassallean General Association 
of German Workers.—566 
619 In his letter to Ferdinand Lassalle of 28 April 1862 Marx entirely denied the 
slanderous rumours which had been repeated by Lassalle besmirching the 
reputation of Johann Philipp Becker, and described him as 'one of the noblest 
German revolutionaries' (see present edition, Vol. 41, p. 356).—567

674 Notes 
620 Confessions—semi-jocular questionnaires that were very popular in England in 
the 1860s. Filling such questionnaires became a favourite pastime in many 
families, including Marx's, in which relatives and friends participated. A 
number of versions of Confessions belonging to Marx came down to us. In this 
volume an early version is published which dates back to the spring of 1865 
when Marx stayed with his uncle Lion Philips in Zalt Bommel (Holland). It is 
somewhat different from the other two versions: the handwritten one included 
in the album of his daughter Jenny (a facsimile of it is published in this 
volume) and the one written in Laura Marx's hand. The latter version partly 
coincides with the one that is being published here and partly with the one in 
Jenny's album, except for the answer to the question: 'Your favourite 
flower — Laurel' (instead of 'Daphne'). 
Major divergencies between the version published here and the one in 
Jenny's album are given in the footnotes.—567 
621 A substantial extract from this letter was published by Johann Philipp Becker in 
Der Vorbote, Jg. 1, No. 2 of February 1866 (present edition, Vol. 20).—568 
622 A reference to a reprint of the first 1848 German edition of the Manifesto of the 
Communist Party made in London probably in 1865: 'Manifest der Kommunisti­
schen Partei. Veröffentlicht im Februar 1848. London, Druck von R. Hirschfeld, 
English and foreign Printer, 1848, 24  S'.— 571 
623 Jenny Marx is recalling the meeting to celebrate an anniversary of the 
International that was held on 28 September 1865. Marx was present at it with 
his daughters. Speeches alternated with musical performances, singing and 
dancing.—571 
624 A reference to Jenny Marx's last trip to Trier in 1856 when she went to see her 
dying mother. Then she stayed in Germany from 22 May to approximately 
10 September 1856.—579 
625 A reference to the letter to Marx from Card (Jösef Cwierczakiewicz) of 
10 January 1868 in which he offered to translate Capital into French (see this 
volume, p. 528).—580 
626 This is an allusion to the explosion in Clerkenwell Prison in London which was 
caused by a group of supporters of the Fenian prisoners in order to free 
them on 13 December 1867 and also to the hanging of three Fenians in 
Manchester on 23 November 1867 who had been captured in an armed assault 
on a police van in order to release the arrested Fenian leaders (see Notes 563 
and 497).—582
