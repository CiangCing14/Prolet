Preface 
Volume 33 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels contains 
the continuation of Marx's Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 
(Notebooks XV to XX, pp. 944-1251 of the manuscript, and the 
continuation of Notebook V, pp. 211-19). The preceding part of 
the manuscript will be found in volumes 30 to 32. The whole 
manuscript is presented here in accordance with its new publica­
tion in the languages of the original in Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe 
(MEGA),  Zweite Abteilung, Bd. 3 (Teile 1-6), Berlin, 1976-1982. 
In the text contained in this volume Marx continues his analysis 
of the capitalist economy, concentrating, in particular, on the 
theory of surplus value and its relation to profit, and proceeds 
with his critique of earlier political economists (Thomas Hodgskin, 
Sir George Ramsay, Antoine Elisée Cherbuliez, Richard Jones). 
Obvious slips of the pen in Marx's text have been corrected by 
the editors without comment. The proper and geographical 
names and other words abbreviated by the author are given in 
full. Defects in the manuscript are indicated in footnotes, places 
where the text is damaged or illegible are marked by dots. Where 
possible, editorial reconstructions are given in square brackets. 
Foreign words and phrases are given as used by Marx, with the 
translation supplied in footnotes where necessary. English phrases 
and individual words occurring in the original are set in small 
caps.  Longer passages and quotations in English are given in 
asterisks. Some of the words are now somewhat archaic or have 
undergone changes in usage. For example, the term "nigger", 
which has acquired generally—and especially in the USA—a more 
profane and unacceptable status than it had in Europe during the 
19th century. The passages from English economists quoted by

XII Preface 
Marx in French or German are given according to contemporary 
English editions. In all cases the form of quoting used by Marx is 
respected. The language in which Marx quotes is indicated unless 
it is German. 
The text and apparatus to Volume 33 were prepared by 
Alexander Chepurenko and Lyubov Zalunina (Institute of Marx­
ism-Leninism of the CC CPSU). Svetlana Kiseleva (IML) took 
part in compiling the Name Index and the Index of Quoted and 
Mentioned Literature. The bulk of the text in this volume was 
translated by Ben Fowkes (Lawrence & Wishart) and edited by 
Victor Schnittke and Andrei Skvarsky. The translation of 
pp. 1084-1157 of Marx's manuscript was taken from the three-
volume edition of Marx's Theories of Surplus Value, issued by 
Progress Publishers, Moscow. It was made by Emile Burns, Renate 
Simpson and Jack Cohen and edited by Salo Ryazanskaya. This 
section was editorially checked with the new MEGA edition by 
Natalia Karmanova and Alia Varavitskaya (Progress Publishers). 
The volume was prepared for the press by Svetlana Gerasimenko 
(Progress Publishers). 
The scientific editor for this volume was Larisa Miskievich 
(Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU).

[MERCANTILE CAPITAL. MONEY-DEALING CAPITAL] 12 
[XV-944] 13 It appears entirely correct to say: 
The division of profit into interest and industrial profit becomes 
evident as soon as there exist 2 classes of CAPITALISTS, MONIED and 
INDUSTRIAL. The existence of these 2 classes is an expression of that 
division; but the split must be there (must be possible) for it to 
appear in the separation of the 2 classes. The profit may, however, 
be so low, e.g. 2%, that small capitalists are unable to live from it 
as MONIED  CAPITALISTS;  but this would not prevent big capitalists from 
doing so, since the sum total, THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT, of interest, 
depends not only on its rate but on the size of the interest-bearing 
capital. 
The level of interest for COMMON AGRICULTURISTS in India, for 
example, by no means indicates a profit of an extraordinary size. 
Firstly, the" profit as well as the interest is appropriated in the 
form of interest, and so is part of wages. (Indirectly also property 
in capital  itself,  i.e. here in the conditions of labour.) Secondly: the 
rate of profit is the higher the lower the mode of production, i.e. 
the more variable capital is expended in proportion to the total 
capital; [or] the [XV-945] smaller the amount of AUXILIARY capital in 
proportion to the capital paid out on labour.14 Thirdly, to be sure, 
there is the paucity of the Indian's needs, determined by 
particular (physical) circumstances.  HENCE  THE LOW  VALUE  of his labour 
capacity. 
With the development of monetary wealth (it is this develop­
ment itself) as opposed to the more restricted forms of AGRICULTURAL 
and artisan wealth, the relation in which on the one hand the 
worker still appears as independent, hence not as a wage labourer, 
but on the other hand the objective conditions of his labour or the 

=====第20页=====
10 Capital and Profit 
product already possess an independent existence alongside 
him—form the joint property of a special class, the usurers  — 
necessarily develops in all modes of production resting more or 
less on exchange. This relation shows itself as a detachment of the 
conditions of labour, which increasingly derive from circulation 
and depend on it, from the economic existence of the worker, 
their attainment of autonomy. On the other hand, the worker has 
not yet been subsumed under the process of capital. Therefore the 
mode of production, too, is not essentially changed. Where this 
relation reoccurs within the bourgeois economy, it is in backward 
branches of industry, or those which are still resisting the 
transition to the modern mode of production. And it is in those 
branches that the most odious exploitation of labour takes place. 
Moreover, the relation between labour and capital does not here 
bear within itself any kind of basis for the development of new 
productive power, or the germs of new historical forms. In the 
mode of production  itself,  capital still appears here as materially 
subsumed under the individual worker or the worker's family, 
whether in handicraft production or in small-scale agriculture. 
Exploitation of capital takes place, without the mode of production 
of capital. The rate of interest is very high, because 1) the rate of 
profit is high, since the proportion of AUXILIARY CAPITAL is small; 
2) the interest includes profit; 3) it even includes part of the wage; 
and 4) it is not only surplus value and wages but the appropriation 
of the conditions of labour themselves. A part of the interest 
cannot be paid; the conditions of labour are themselves mortgaged 
(as in India). With industrial capital it goes without saying that the 
part of the product which represents the conditions of labour falls 
to the share of the capitalist. This form of usury, in which capital 
does not take control of the mode of production, hence is capital 
only formally, presupposes pre-bourgeois modes of production as 
dominant; but it is reproduced again in bourgeois society in 
subordinate spheres. In so far as the effect of this capital is not 
political—dissolution of existing conditions, as in antiquity, etc.— 
in so far as it has an historical meaning, it is the separation of the 
conditions of labour from the worker on the one hand; which is 
the same thing in other words as the formation thereby of 
monetary wealth which later buys the conditions of production as 
commodities.15 
Another historical form of interest (wherever there is slavery, 
serfdom, and wealth and income founded thereon): lending of 
capital to wealth engaged in consumption. This appears historically 
important here as itself a process by which capital originates, in that the

income, rent and often the  LAND  TOO OF THE  LANDED PROPRIETORS 
ACCUMULATES  AND  BECOMES CAPITALISED  IN THE  HANDS  OF THE  USURERS. This  is 
one of the  forms  in which money, circulating capital, accumulates 
in the  hands  of a  class independent  of landed property. 
Trade develops with  the  development  of capitalist production, 
and at the  same time  the  necessity arises  for the  producer  to 
produce commodities, partly  to buy the  elements  of these, partly 
to sell  the  product,  to pay  within certain  due  dates,  etc. In  short, 
the money form  of the  commodity becomes essential  to him. This 
leads  to an  extension  of usury, which  now  already begins  to 
perform increasingly  the  function  of interest-bearing capital  in the 
modern sense.  But the  money still lies  in part  in the  hands  of 
old-fashioned usurers,  a few  money-dealers, monopolists, who thus 
hold sway over  the  emerging industries. Hence  the  struggle,  in 
the 17th  century  for  example.16 
It is clear that where trade  and  industry develop  in towns, 
money-dealing also develops. Here usury  is already more sub­
sumed  in relation  to this form  of capital (merchants' capital).  It first 
becomes subordinated with  the  development  of forms  of credit  in 
which payment  in cash  or  payment  in gold, silver, loses  its 
significance.  But a new  class  of parasites develops  on this basis. 
For the  development  of usury nothing  is needed except  a 
certain development  of commodity production  and of the  necessity 
of making payments  in money. There exists  on the one  hand,  in 
the SLAVEHOLDER,  FEUDAL  LORD,  a person  who  possesses  SURPLUS  labour 
and who  turns  it over  to or  shares  it with  the  usurer. Similarly  a 
class of merchants, alongside whom  the  hoard-builder  who has 
developed into  a usurer settles down, sharing with them their profits, 
which  are for the  most part  PROFIT  UPON  EXPROPRIATION. 17 In relation  to 
the small-scale producers, finally,  it is a  manner  of reducing their 
income  to a  mere wage  and  appropriating  the  conditions  of 
labour. 
[XV-946] Thus  as long  as money capital retains  its old-fashioned 
structure  of usury,  the  rate of interest  is compulsorily forced  DOWN 
by law.  As soon  as the  form  of credit  has  been created—in which 
all the  latent money capital  of society  is placed  at the  disposal  of 
industrial production—as soon  as money capital  has  become  a 
commodity, subjected  to competition, there  is an end to the 
forcible methods  of subjecting  it to  industrial capital  and  reducing 
it to a  mere form,  a moment  of the  latter.

12 Capital and Profit 
as commodity, the less exchange value takes control of production 
over the whole of its breadth and depth, the more does money 
appear as actual wealth, as abstract wealth, vis-à-vis the restricted 
modes of representation it has in use values. Hoard formation is 
based on this. Leaving aside its functions of world money and 
hoard, it is precisely in the form of the means of payment that 
money appears as the absolute form of the commodity. And it is 
its development as means of payment which chiefly gives rise to 
interest, and develops money as money capital. 18 What spendthrift 
or corrupting wealth wants is money as money,  AS THE  GENERAL  POWER 
OF PURCHASING.  (Also for paying debts.) Where the small producer 
needs money above all, is for payment. In both cases money is used 
as money. Hoard formation, on the other hand, only becomes 
real, fulfils its dream, in usury. What is demanded of the usurer is 
not capital, but money as money, and through interest he converts 
this hoard of money for himself into capital, self-valorising value, a 
means whereby he takes control of part of the surplus labour and 
part of the conditions of production themselves, even if they 
remain nominally independent of him. Usury exists apparently in 
the pores of production, like the gods in the system of Epicurus.19 
This form of interest-bearing capital admittedly presupposes that 
production has developed the circulation of commodities so far 
that it has progressed to the formation of money, and developed 
money in its various functions. But it depends on a situation in 
which the part of the product which is converted into a 
commodity still only forms a relatively small part of production, 
and in which the conversion of the commodity into money is still 
difficult, and money  itself,  the existence of the commodity as 
exchange value, is still exceptional. This kind of money capital, 
although it presupposes the production of commodities, cannot be 
derived directly from the relation between commodity and money. 
The more the commodity develops as a commodity, the more does 
money develop as its pure form; and the more is the price at 
which the commodities are sold determined by their value. It is 
competition as form of realisation of capital, in which this is paid. 
That money is paid for money loaned is a simple consequence of 
the need TO HAVE IT ON ANY PRICE, and the hoard-forming usurer 
exploits this need.20 Money is a condition, a necessary condition, 
and it is the more difficult to obtain the less the commodity form 
is the general form of the product. It is a condition for 
production, even though still very extraneous, and a condition for 
extravagance and to fulfil the need for corruption. As such a 
condition, as money, it is sold. Merchants' wealth is older than 

=====第23页=====

interest-bearing money capital to the extent that it emerges directly 
from the circulation of commodities, whereas money capital 
emerges from the privileged position of money which grows out of 
circulation, and from the need for it as a condition. In the first 
case the form of circulation is M—C— M (or C— M—C). In the 
second the result is M—M'; that more money can be made with 
money. In so far as it attaches itself to commercial capital it has the 
same relation to it as interest-bearing capital does to capital on the 
basis of capitalist production in general. In contrast to this, where 
it exploits small-scale property or extravagant wealth (which itself 
appropriates the labour of slaves or serfs), it emerges simply from 
money as money—as hoard, in its function of means of payment, 
etc., and the price at which it is granted is determined purely by 
the price the usurer succeeds in extorting. That "nothing is given 
for nothing", hence nothing is lent free of charge, is already 
evident from the fact that [XV-947] with the development of the 
commodity every divestiture appears as an appropriation. 21 
Commercial capital, or money as it appears in merchants' 
wealth, is the first form of capital, i.e. value which proceeds 
exclusively from circulation (from exchange), preserves, repro­
duces,  and increases itself within it; and thus the exclusive purpose 
of this movement is exchange value. There are two movements: 
buying in order to sell, and selling in order to buy, but M—C— M 
is the predominant one. Money and its increase predominate as 
the exclusive purpose of the operation. Commercial capital is 
money as the mediating movement of circulation. Money similarly 
appears here as an end in  itself,  without on that account 
rigidifying in its metallic existence. It is here the living transforma­
tion of value into the two forms of the commodity and money; the 
indifference of value towards the particular use values in which it 
is incorporated, and at the same time its metamorphosis into all of 
these forms, which appear, however, merely as disguises for it. 
Thus while the action of commerce gathers together the conditions 
of circulation, and merchants' wealth is therefore on the one hand 
the first form of capital's existence, and also appears historically in 
this way, on the other hand this form appears as contradictory to 
the concept of value. To buy cheap so as to sell dearer is the law of 
commerce. Hence not the exchange of equivalents. The concept of 
value is present to the extent that the different commodities are all 
value, and therefore money; equal, from the qualitative point of 
view, expressions of social labour. But they are not equal 
magnitudes of value. It should in general be noted that when 
products are first exchanged as commodities the quantitative ratio 

=====第24页=====
14 Capital and Profit 
in which they are exchanged is  d'abord 3 directly a matter of 
accident. They are posited as commodities to the extent that they 
are exchangeable at all, i.e. expressions of the same thing. But it is 
not thereby posited that they are equivalents, in so far as each 
contains the same amount of labour time. Continued exchange 
and therewith reproduction increasingly eliminates this accidental 
character. At first, however, this does not operate for the 
producer on the one side and the consumer on the other, but 
rather for the mediating movement between both of them, for the 
merchant, who compares the money prices and pockets the 
difference. He posits the equivalence through his own movement. 
He compares the prices. If the whole of production is based on 
the exchange value of the product, the value of the commodity is 
regulated not only by its qualitative but by its quantitative identity. 
Money as commercial wealth, as it appears embedded in the most 
divergent forms of society, and at the most distinct stages of the 
development of the social forces of production, is merely the 
mediating movement between extremes it does not dominate and 
presuppositions it does not create. 
Money emerges from the mere form of commodity circulation 
C—M—C not only as measure of values and means of circulation 
but as absolute form of the commodity and thereby of wealth, as 
hoard, etc., and its retention and increase as money appears as an 
end in  itself;  in the same way, money, the hoard as self-preserving 
and self-increasing by alienation, emerges from the mere form of 
merchants' wealth,  M—C—M',  as a value which increases itself 
merely by being alienated. Usurers' capital has the same relation to 
merchants' wealth as interest-bearing money capital has to industrial 
capital. Usurers' capital, in and for  itself,  is as far from having an 
internal limit as is merchants' wealth, which rests on PROFIT UPON 
EXPROPRIATION. The second depends on fraud, which goes as far as it 
can, and the first depends on force, which goes as far as it can. 
That both develop monetary wealth means in fact that they 
appropriate for themselves the wealth of society in the form of 
money; that they monopolise the monetary wealth of society. 
Independent merchants' wealth—as predominant form of 
capital—is the achievement by the process of circulation of an 
independent position vis-à-vis its extremes—and these extremes 
are the exchanging producers themselves. These extremes remain 
independent towards this process, this process is, conversely, 
independent towards them. Here the product becomes a commod-
a At first.— Ed.

ity through trade. Trade does  not  exist because  the  product  is 
produced from  the  outset  as a  commodity  (or if it is  this  is only 
within narrow limits). Here  it is  trade which develops  the  forming 
of products into commodities; trade  is not the  movement  of 
produced commodities. Here, therefore, capital first makes  its 
appearance  as capital  in the  circulation process, because this 
process  is altogether  the  form  in which exchange value first moves 
as in its  element; exchange value dominates this form, whose 
development  is the  circulation  process.  What  is produced,  as a  result 
of this money developed  in the  circulation process into capital,  is 
money capital quand même* usurers' capital. 
[XV-947a]  The  long  and  short  of this story,  the  reason  why 
capital develops  as commercial capital  and  usurers' capital—in 
these  two  forms  as monetary wealth—before  its  actual shape 
emerges,  the  shape  in which  it subjects production  to itself, the 
shape  in which  it constitutes  the  fundamental form  of modern 
society,  is this, that  the  product  is first developed  as exchange 
value  in circulation, that  it first becomes commodity  and  money  in 
circulation. Capital  can be  formed  in the  circulation process,  and 
must  be formed  in it,  before  it dominates  the  extremes  of the 
process—the different spheres  of production between which  the 
circulation process mediates.  The  circulation  of money  and 
commodities—hence also money  and  commodity capital—can 
mediate between  the  spheres  of production  of the  most diverse 
organisations, which  by virtue  of their internal structure  are  still 
chiefly directed towards  the  production  of use  value. This 
achievement  of an  independent position  by the  circulation process, 
whereby  the  spheres  of production'  are  related  to each other  by a 
third element, expresses  two  things.  It expresses both that 
circulation  has not yet  taken control  of production,  but  rather 
relates  to it as an  indifferent presupposition,  a given presupposi­
tion,  and  that  the  process  of production  has not  absorbed that  of 
circulation  as a  mere moment  of itself.  Both these things  are 
apparent  in capitalist production.  The  process  of production rests 
entirely  on  circulation,  and  circulation  is a  mere moment  of 
production, merely  the  realisation  of the  product produced  as a 
commodity.  The  form  of capital which  it obtains directly  out of 
circulation, that  of commercial capital, appears here  as merely  a 
form of capital  in its  movement  of reproduction;  the  same  is true 
of all the  forms  it assumes  as money capital,  and the  valorisation 
of money capital  as  -such—through  its  mere alienation  as

commodity—appears  as a  particular form merely through  its 
valorisation  in the  production process  itself. 
Wealth  as the  subject  of consumption. This  is at  bottom more akin 
to productive capital than  to commercial capital  or usurers' capital, 
because  it is a  direct appropriation  of surplus labour  (of the  slave, 
the serf, etc.)  through  the  possession  of the  conditions  of 
production.  But  here  the  worker himself still belongs d'une manière 
ou d'une autre*  to the  objective conditions  of production. What  is 
predominant  is use  value.  The  agents  do not  come  to meet each 
other  as buyers  and  sellers.  The  independent forms  of exchange 
value  as money  and as  commodity  do not  condition  the  process 
itself.  The  slave  (not the  serf)  may be  bought  as a  commodity.  But 
his exploitation does  not  take place  in the  form  of the  exchange  of 
commodities between exploiter  and  exploited. Slavery, serfdom, 
are posited  by relations independent  of production itself—in  so 
far as it is directed to exchange value. The  SLAVEHOLDER,  FEUDAL  LORD, 
possesses surplus labour  in the  form  of  HOMELY VALUES IN USE.  The 
merchant brings  him  commodities,  of which  he exchanges very 
few for the  mass  of these products. Usury attaches itself here  to 
anticipate  the  income  of the  LANDLORD,  etc., to  provide  for him the 
means with which  to purchase  the  merchant's commodities,  and 
altogether  to advance  to him  that form  of wealth through which  it 
always holds power over  men and  things.  On top of  this there  is 
the necessity  for payment. 
Productive classes. 
To the  extent that usury becomes attached  to merchants' wealth 
itself,  the  latter aims  to gain  a profit.  It therefore pays interest  in 
order  to make more profit. Here  the  interest must already become 
more moderate, because  it must allow  the  possibility  of a  profit;  it 
may however, where things  are on a  small scale, also lead simply 
to an increase  in prices,  to which interest  and a  proportional 
amount  of profit  are  added. There  are  natural limits  to this 
increase. With  the  merchant there  is never  the  compulsion  to buy 
from  him  BEYOND  A CERTAIN PRICE. Thus reproduction  is slow despite 
the high prices, because  the  market  is restricted. Here, then, usury 
dominates the small, nascent  COMMERCIAL  and  INDUSTRIAL  TRADE.  On the 
other hand, trade whose wealth exists only  in circulation leads  to 
the absolute dependence  of that wealth  on circulation, [XV-947b] 
to the  development  of due  dates  of payment,  to dependence  on 
the RETURNS,  on the  payments  of others, etc.  But in so far as  money 
is means  of payment  it must absolutely  be procured, AT  WHATEVER  COST.

Here therefore usury—which advances the money—rules uncon­
ditionally, prescribes the conditions. 
Petty-bourgeois and small peasant industry.23 
Needs money either as means of purchase or means of payment. 
As means of purchase chiefly when, in forms of production where 
the worker must still be the proprietor of his conditions of 
production, must possess the conditions of production, those 
conditions are lost to him through accidents or extraordinary 
vicissitudes, or at least fail to be replaced in the customary course 
of reproduction. For example, harvest failure or cattle plague, etc. 
These [corn and cattle] also belong among the conditions of 
production as means of subsistence and raw material. A mere rise 
in their price can make him incapable of buying them back with 
the yield of his product or even replacing them in natura. 
Examples: the same wars through which the Roman patricians 
ruined the plebeians, forcing them into military services which 
prevented them from reproducing their conditions of labour, 
hence impoverishing them (and this is here the predominant 
form—impoverishment is here the loss of the conditions of 
reproduction), filled up their storehouses and cellars with cap­
tured copper, the money of that epoch. Instead of giving the 
plebeians directly the commodities—corn, horses, etc.—they lent 
them this useless copper, and used the situation to charge 
enormous, usurious interest rates. Under Charlemagne, who 
similarly ruined the peasants, all they could do was become serfs 
instead of debtors. Thus we know that in Africa, as in the 
Romanian principalities, 23 etc., starvation leads people e.g. to sell 
themselves as slaves to those who are richer. This for the 
epoch-making moments at which money develops as usurers' 
capital. If this is considered in detail, the retention or the loss of 
the conditions of production depends for the individual producer 
on 1,000 fortuities, and every such accident of loss—of impove­
rishment—is a point at which the usurer-parasite can strike root. 
For a small peasant it merely needs the death of a cow, for a small 
cobbler it merely needs a rise in the price of leather, to make both 
of them unable TO BEGIN their reproduction ANEW on the previous 
scale: and here usury steps in, seizing control of their surplus 
labour, etc., by alienating from them their conditions of produc­
tion juristically if not yet economically. Here money is demanded 
purely as means of purchase, yet the intention is neither to 
consume nor to make a "profit", but rather to recover control of 
the conditions of labour which have been lost.

extent and peculiar to it. Here money steps forth in its absolute 
form, and indeed in the usual sphere of the production process, in 
the native sphere of the circulation process. In the narrowest 
circle. Every monetary obligation to be fulfilled on certain TERMS, 
tribute, taxation, involves the necessity to pay money. And with 
the slightest degree of division of labour, and emerging from 
commodity production  itself,  the relation of creditor and debtor 
develops from that of buyer and seller, as I have proved,3 partly 
from the particular form of alienation which flows from the 
particular nature of use values, partly from the failure of the 
different times and periods of production of the different TRADES to 
coincide. Here it is absolutely essential to have the commodity in 
the form of money at the particular time appointed. Use value as 
such, the commodities themselves, appear here as worthless 
rubbish. Money is absolute, counts for everything, and this 
all-embracing power of money is the power of the usurer. 
[XV-948] Even on the basis of modern capital, e.g. in monetary 
crises,  where interest=20%, the price of the commodity is far 
below its production costs. Then usury holds sway even here. And 
the same usury is the chief means of developing the necessity of 
money as means of payment, for it pushes the producer more and 
more deeply into debt, and nullifies his usual means of payment, 
his total production being insufficient for him to pay the interest. 
Here usury sprouts from money as means of payment and creates 
and extends this form of money, hence its own terrain. 
Means of purchase—as soon as the usual reproduction is 
dislocated and fails to provide for the replacement of the 
conditions of labour, which therefore have to be derived from 
circulation. Means of payment as the form of money in which it 
appears, in general, as the absolute form vis-à-vis concrete wealth. 
In both forms money is required not as capital but as money: In 
one case money must, by way of exception, be first converted into 
the conditions of labour. In the other case we have the necessity of 
conversion into money. In both forms money capital develops on a 
basis independent of capitalist production. In both forms it can 
lead to the latter. In their direct form, usury and trade merely 
exploit given relations of production. They do not create these 
relations; are external to them. Direct usury endeavours to 
preserve them in order to be able to exploit them again and again; 
it is conservative, it merely makes them more wretched. The less

the conditions of production enter the process and emerge from it 
again as a commodity, the more does their creation out of money 
appear as a specific act. The less the whole of production depends 
on circulation, with payments exclusively in cash, with the sale of 
commodities restricted to a narrow sphere, with little accumulation 
and little money in circulation, with slow and interrupted 
metamorphoses, little intertwining therefore of the production 
process of one person with the circulation of the other, the 
stronger is the power of money as means of payment. Hence the 
greater the area for usury. Just as money as hoard is the more 
important, the less exchange value is developed, so money as 
usurers' capital is the more important, the less money is a form 
naturally implied by the mode of production. 
The development of monetary wealth as a particular form of 
wealth means with regard to usurers' capital that all its claims are 
possessed in the form of monetary claims. The more the bulk of 
production in a given country is restricted to payments in kind, 
etc., and use value, the more does monetary wealth develop there. 
Adam Smith has this to say with regard to merchants' capital: 
"The inhabitants of a city, it is true, must always ultimately derive their 
subsistence, and the whole materials and means of their industry, from the country. 
But those of a city, situated near either the sea-coast or the banks of a navigable 
river, may draw them from the most remote corners of the world, either in 
exchange for the manufactured produce of their own industry, or by performing 
the office of carriers between distant countries, and exchanging the produce of one 
for that of another. A city might, in this manner, grow up to great wealth, while 
not only the country in its neighbourhood, but all those to which it traded, were in 
poverty. Each of those countries, perhaps, taken singly, could afford it but a small 
part either of its subsistence or of its employment; but all of them taken together, 
could afford it both a great subsistence, and a great employment" ([Garnier,] t. Il, 
liv. Ill [pp. 452-53; McCulloch's edition, Vol. Ill, p. 209] 24). 
Just as money first developed [in exchange] between com­
munities, so did trade first develop as foreign trade and 
intermediary trade. On a large scale first as  CARRYING  TRADE. 
"The cities of Italy seem to have been the first in Europe which were raised by 
commerce. The crusades gave extraordinary encouragement to the shipping of 
Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, sometimes in transporting men, and always in supplying 
them with provisions. These republics were the commissaries, if one may say so, of 
those armies" (I.e. [p. 454; Vol. Ill, p. 210]). 
[XV-949] "The inhabitants of trading cities, by importing the improved 
manufactures and expensive luxuries of richer countries, afforded some food to 
the vanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly purchased them with great 
quantities of the rude produce of their own lands. The commerce of a great part 
of Europe in those times, accordingly, consisted in the exchange of their own rude, 
for the manufactured produce of more civilised nations" ([pp.] 454-55 [ibid.]). 
Luxury manufactures, the offspring of  FOREIGN COMMERCE,  established by 
merchants ([pp.] 456-57 [Vol. Ill, p. 211]) (worked up foreign materials).

Adam Smith speaks of a second kind, which 
"grow up naturally, and ... of their own accord, by the gradual refinement of 
household manufactures. Worked up  HOME-GROWN MATERIALS"  ([p.] 459 [Vol. Ill, 
p. 213]). 
The trading peoples of antiquity, like the gods of Epicurus, 
exist in the spaces between the worlds, or RATHER like the Jews in 
the pores of Polish society.19 
The first independent trading peoples or cities attained their 
magnificent development through the  CARRYING  TRADE,  which rested 
on the barbarism of the producing peoples, between which they 
played the part of intermediary. 
In the preliminary stages of bourgeois society, trade dominates 
industry; in modern society the reverse. Trade will naturally react 
back to varying degrees upon the communities between which it is 
carried on. It will subjugate production more and more to 
exchange value; force direct use value more and more into the 
background, by making enjoyment and subsistence more depen­
dent on the sale than on the immediate use of the product. It 
dissolves the old relations. It increases the circulation of money. It 
does not merely seize hold of the overflow of production; it 
progressively bites into production  itself.  (Certain branches of 
production are still based on trade.) Yet its solvent effect depends 
to a great extent on the nature of the producing communities 
between which it operates. For example, [it] has hardly shaken the 
old Indian communities and Asiatic relations in general. Fraud in 
exchange is the basis of trade where it appears independently. 
Commercial wealth, like usury, as an independent economic 
form and as the foundation for trading peoples and trading cities, 
exists and has existed between peoples standing at very different 
stages of economic development, and production in the guild 
form, etc., can continue to exist in the trading city itself (the old 
Asian cities, the Italian cities of the Middle Ages, the Greek cities, 
etc.). 
* " Trade is an operation, by which the wealth, or work, either of individuals, or 
of societies, may be exchanged by a set of men called merchants, for an equivalent, 
proper for supplying every want, without any interruption to industry, or check to 
consumption"* ([James] Steuart, [An Inquiry etc.,] Dublin edition, [1770,] Vol. I, 
[p.] 166).25 * "While wants continue simple and few, a workman finds time enough 
to distribute his work: when wants become more multiplied, men must work 
harder; time becomes precious; hence trade is introduced with the merchant as 
middleman between workmen and consumers" ([p.] 171). "The collection"* 
(of products. The TRADE is concentrated at first, but in circulation, 
while the work itself continues to be carried on in isolation.) 
*"into a few hands is the introduction of trade"*  [ibid.].

(This COLLECTION  INTO  A FEW  HANDS  is not yet  a feature  of the process 
of production itself.) 
"The  CONSUMER  does  not buy  so as to  sell again.  The  merchant buys  and  sells 
solely  WITH  A VIEW  TO GAIN"  ([p.] 175). "The  most simple  of all TRADE,  is that which 
is carried  on by  BARTERING  the  necessary articles  of subsistence" (barter between  the 
SURPLUS  fund  of the  farmers  and the  FREE HANDS26 ) ([p.] 175).  "When reciprocal 
wants  are  SUPPLIED  BY BARTER,  there  is not the  smallest occasion  for  money: this  is 
the most simple  of all  combinations. When wants  are  multiplied,  BARTERING 
BECOMES  more difficult;  UPON THIS  MONEY  IS INTRODUCED.  This is the  COMMON PRICE 
of all  things:  it is a  PROPER equivalent  in the  hands  of those  who  WANT. This 
OPERATION  OF BUYING  AND  SELLING  is a  little more complex than  the  former" [ibid., 
p. 177]. 
Thus  1)  BARTER;  2)  SALE; 3)  COMMERCE.  The  merchant must  be 
introduced. What before  we  called WANTS  is here represented  by 
the CONSUMER; what  we called industry,  by the  MANUFACTURER; what  we 
called money, [XV-950a]  by the  merchant. 
//Money  is on the one  hand  the  first metamorphosis  of the 
commodity,  its existence  as exchange value. Secondly, however,  it 
is the  beginning  of the 2nd  metamorphosis,  as the form  in which 
the commodity  is converted into  the  other commodity.  The 
merchant represents these  two  points,  the 2 moments  of money  in 
M—C—M,  but in  such  a way  that money itself appears  as the 
aim. // 
"...This  OPERATION  of BUYING  and  SELLING  is TRADE:  IT  RELIEVES  both parties of 
the whole  TROUBLE  OF  TRANSPORTATION,  and  ADJUSTING  WANTS  TO  WANTS,  OR  WANTS 
TO MONEY;  THE  MERCHANT  REPRESENTS  BY  TURNS  THE  CONSUMER,  THE  MANUFACTURER, 
AND THE MONEY.  To the  CONSUMER  he appears  as the  whole body  of MANUFACTUR­
ERS; to the  manufacturer  as the  whole body  of  CONSUMERS;  and to  one and the 
other class  HIS  CREDIT SUPPLIES  THE USE OF  MONEY"  ([pp.] 177-78). 
* "Merchants  are  supposed  to buy and  sell not by necessity,  but  with  a view  to 
profit"* (I.e.,  [p.]  201). 
Gilbart  (J. W.),  The  History  and  Principles  of Banking, London, 
1834, has  this to say  about interest: 
"That  a man who  borrows money with  a view  of making  a profit  by it,  should 
give some portion  of his  profit  to the  lender,  is A SELF-EVIDENT PRINCIPLE  OF 
NATURAL JUSTICE.  A man  makes  a profit usually  by means  of TRAFF1CK.  But in the 
Middle Ages  the  population  was  purely agricultural.  And  under such conditions,  as 
under  FEUDAL GOVERNMENT,  there  can be but  little TRAFFICK,  and  hence little  PROFIT. 
Therefore,  the  laws on  usury  in the  Middle Ages were justified"  [pp. 163, 164]. 
"Besides,  IN  AN AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY  A PERSON SELDOM WANTS  TO  BORROW MONEY 
EXCEPT  HE  BE  REDUCED  TO  POVERTY  OR  DISTRESS  BY  MISERY"  (p.  163). 
"Henry VIII limited interest  to 10%, James  I to 8,  Charles  II to 6,  Anne  to 5%" 
(pp. 164-65).  "In  those times,  the  lenders were  in fact, if not  legally, monopolists, 
and hence  it was  necessary that they, like other monopolists, should  be  placed 
under  RESTRAINT"  (I.e.,  [p.]  165).  "In our  times,  it is the  rate of profit which 
regulates  the  rate of interest;  in those times,  it was  the  rate of interest which 
regulated  the  rate of profit.  If the money-lender charged  a high rate  of interest  to

the merchant,  the  merchant  had to  charge  a higher rate  of profit  on his  GOODS. 
Hence,  a large  sum of  money  was  taken from  the  pockets  of the  purchasers  to be 
put into  the  pockets  of the  MONEY-LENDERS.  This  ADDITIONAL PRICE,  put  upon  the 
goods, made  the  capital less able  and  less inclined  to purchase them"  ([p.] 165). 
In the 17th century, Josiah Child, in his Traités sur le commerce et 
sur les avantages qui résultent de la réduction de l'intérêt de l'argent 
(written in 1669, translated from the English), Amsterdam and 
Berlin, 1754 //a Traité contre l'usure, by Thomas Culpeper, 1621, is 
there as well argues against Thomas Manley (whose  TRACT  is called 
Interest of Money Mistaken), calling him the  "CHAMPION OFTHE USURERS". 27 
The starting point, as with all the discussions of the English 
political economists of the 17th century, is naturally the wealth of 
Holland, where "the  RATE  OF INTEREST  is LOW".  Child makes this  LOW 
RATE OF INTEREST  the reason for the wealth [of the Dutch], Manly says 
it is only the result of it. 
"Insomuch that  to know whether  any  country  be rich  or poor  no other question 
needs  to be  resolved,  but  this,  viz.  What interest  do  they  pay for  money?" 
([J. Child, Brief Observations Concerning Trade  and  Interest  of Money, London,  1668, 
p. 9] I.e., [p.] 74).a  "Like  a stout champion  for the sly and  timorous herd  of 
usurers,  he  plants  his  main battery against that part which  I confessed  to be 
weakest.  ... And he  positively denies that  the  lowness  of interest  is the  cause  of 
wealth  and  affirms  it to be  only  the  effect  thereof"  ([J.  Child,  A New  Discourse  of 
Trade..., London,  1775, p. 39;  Traités...,  p.]  120). b "When interest  is abated, 
they who  call in their money must either  buy  land (whose price goes  up as a  result 
of the  number  of buyers)  or trade with  it" ([A New  Discourse...,  p. 47;  Traités..., 
p.] 133). a "Whilst interest  is at 6 per  cent  no man  will run an  adventure  to sea for 
the gain  of 8 or 9 per  cent which  the  Dutch, having money  at 4 or 3 per  cent  at 
interest,  are  contented with" ([ibid.; Traités...,  p.] 134). "The low  rate  of interest 
and the  high price  of land force  the  merchant  to stick  to commerce" ([ibid.,  p. 52; 
Traités...,  p.] 140). "The  reduction  of interest inclines  a nation  to thriftiness" 
([ibid.; Traités...,  p.]  144). a "If  trade  be  that which enriches  any  kingdom,  and 
lowering  of interest advances trade, then  the  abatement  of interest,  or more 
properly restraining  of usury,  is doubtless  a primary  and  principal cause  of the 
riches of  any  nation;  it being  not  absurd  to say  that  the  same thing  may be  both 
[XV-950b]  a cause under certain  CIRCUMSTANCES  and an  effect under others" 
([ibid.,  p. 58;  Traités...,  p.] 155). a "An egg is the  cause  of a hen, and a hen the 
cause  of an egg. The  abatement  of interest causes  an increase  of wealth,  and the 
increase  of wealth  may  cause  a further abatement  of interest.  But  that  is best done 
by the  midwifery  of  good laws" ([ibid.,  p. 59;  Traités...,  p.]  156). a "I am an 
advocate  for  industry,  my  adversary  for  idleness  and  sloth" ([ibid.,  p. 71;  Traités...,

The number of turnovers of capital can only increase profits 
in so far as it increases the number of reproductions, hinc* the 
amount OF SURPLUS LABOUR, or the amount of reproduction (its 
scale) in the same period of time. Engaged capital cannot be 
utilised to extend the scale of reproduction. But with COMMERCIAL 
CAPITAL the situation is different. 
If the productivity of industry increases, the price of the 
individual commodity falls. It contains less labour, less paid and 
unpaid labour. Let us assume 300 yards of linen instead of 100. 
Let these 300 be the work of 10 men (as linen, and let yarn 
remain equally expensive, etc.); while previously the 100 were the 
work of 10 men. In the latter case 10 yards would contain the 
work of one man, for instance=12 hours of labour. 
10 yards=12 hours of labour; 1 yard = 12/io=6/5=l1/5 hours of 
labour. In the former case 30 yards=12 hours of labour; 
1 yard=12/30 hours of labour=4/io=2/5 hours of labour. In one case 
the yard contains 6/5 hours of labour, in the other 2/s, hence 
3 times less. Assume that 1 hour of labour=3 shillings.28 Then in 
the first case the yard costs l'/ss. and in the second 2/5s. In the first 
case Is. 22/sd. and in the second case 44/gd. Assume now that the 
yarn, etc., the constant capital contained in the yard,=ls. Then in 
the first case the yard costs 2s. 22/sd. and in the second Is. 44/5d. 
Assume the wage='/2 of the value added; then in the first case the 
yard contains 7Vsd. and in the second 22/sd. [of the wage]. The 
surplus value is equal to this. The ratio between the wage and the 
surplus value has remained the same. If the individual commodity 
is considered, the profit (and the wage) contained in it is 3 times 
smaller than in the other case. But if the total amount is 
considered,the total of wages and profits has remained the same, 
because 10x775=30x22/5. The rate of profit, in contrast, would 
have fallen, because the capital laid out in yarn, etc., would be 
tripled. The rate of profit could only remain the same if the yarn, 
etc., had also fallen three times in value or there had been a 
threefold reduction in wages. 
In the first case the 10 yards cost 10 (2s. 22/sd.)=£l 2s. 
In the second case the 30 yards cost 30 (Is. 44/5d.)=£2 2s. (but in 
the first case 30 would have cost £3 6s.) 
Let us now assume that the cost of the yarn, etc., falls threefold 
in the second case as well. 
Thus in the first case the 10 yards cost £1 2s., and one yard 
costs 2s. 22/5d. 
a Hence.— Ed.

24 Capital and Profit 
In the second case the 30 yards cost £1 2s. and one yard costs 
84/5d. 
In this case too, the total amount of profit (and wages) is as 
much for the 30 yards as it was previously for the 10; despite the 
big fall in the price of the commodity, of each individual yard. 
The rate of profit is the same on the individual yard, for in the 
first case it comes to  7'/sd.  on an outlay of Is.  7'/5d.  In the second 
case the ratio is 22/5:62/5. In both of them the ratio is 3:8. But from 
the point of view of the individual yard the amount of profit is 
reduced. In the first case it was  7'/sd.,  while in the second it is now 
only 22/5d.29 
[XV-950] If 300 yards are the work of 10 men, who previously 
produced 100 yards, there would be in the first case 30 yards 
from 1 man, in the second 10 yards from 1 man. In the first case 
the yard contains '/so of a day's labour, in the second case Vio-
Let us therefore assume that the price of the yarn, etc., remains 
the same, e.g. = x; then in one case the price of the 
yard =  x + '/io M,a in the other it=x +  '/3o M. The 100 yards cost in 
the first case 100 (x +  Vio M)=100x + 10 M; and in the second 300 
(x + Vso) = 300 x+10 M. It is clear, therefore, that if the wage 
remains the same, e.g. l/2 of the day's labour, the amount of profit 
will remain the same in both cases. In the first case the profit on 
100 yards=100/2o M=5 M, and in the second case the profit on 
300 yards=300/60=10 72o=5 M. The amount of profit is the same 
here because 100 (V20) is not more than 300 (/«))• But the rate of 
profit has fallen; for in the [first] case the outlay on one 
yard =  x + V2o M and the profit='/2o M. In the second case [the 
outlay] =  3c + '/6o [M] and the profit='/6o- If the man's cost=20s., 
and the x (yarn, etc.)=ls., then  X + V20 M= ls.+ls. =  2s. And the 
profit similarly ='/2o M=ls. The price would therefore be 3s., and 
the profit within that would be V3. In the other case 
X + VÔO M=ls.+4d.= ls. 4d. And the profit would =  '/6o M=4d. 
Therefore the price=ls. 8d. and the profit within that would be 
V5. Disregarding this fall in the rate of profit, the total amount of 
profit on each yard would in the first case='/2o M and in the 
second  VÖO [M], hence 3 times less. But the latter profit is repeated 
on 3 times as many yards as the former. 
Let us posit the second  case,  namely that the yarn becomes cheaper 
TO THE  SAME  DEGREE as weaving becomes more productive. 
Under the old mode of production 100 yards would have been 
produced by 10 men. The price of the whole product= 
a "M" designates one worker's working day.— Ed.

= 100 x +10 M. The price of a single yard=x +'/io M. And the profit 
on that is V20 M. 
In the second case the yarn, etc., for 300 yards costs 
300/3 x=100 x. The 300 yards cost 100  x +10 M. The price of a 
single yard is 7s+'/so M. The profit='/60 M. So if x again=ls. and 
1 M=20s., the yard cost Vss.[+]  20/soS. = Vs [s.]+ 2/3s.= ls. The profit 
out of this would be  VÔO M= 20/6oS.  = 1/3s. The rate of profit would 
therefore be Vs of the whole, as in the old production. But the 
amount of profit on a single yard would in the first case be V20 M or 
Is.; in the second it would only be '/6o of a man =  V3S.,  hence 
3 times less. The profit on the total number of yards would be the 
same, for 100 or  100s.  = 300x 1/3s.=300/3=100s. 
Assume a third case, in which it is not the yarn but the wage 
which falls in the same measure as weaving becomes more 
productive. 
In the old mode of production the yard =  x + '/io M. The 
profit=Vso M. In the new mode of production the yard =  x + 7so M. 
But the profit=2/90 M. The outlay is  x + Vso M. Therefore if  x = ls. 
and 1  M = 20s.,  [XV-951] Vso M=20/30s.=2/3s. 3/90  M = Vsn M=2/3s. 
and V90 M=2/9S. The profit would therefore be 4/gS. 
The price of the commodity=l2/3s. The profit contained within 
that=4/gs. The price of the commodity=15/gS., of which 4/g, hence 
more than 'A, is profit. 
Positing the fourth case: yarn and wages fall equally. 
So we have the following four cases: 
Case I. Price of yarn, etc., remains the same in both modes of 
production = Is., per yard. The value of a man or a day's 
labour=20s. 
a) 10 M produce 100 yards, 1 M 10 yards; 1 yard therefore 
contains V10 of a man= 2%os.=2s. The yard therefore costs Is. 
yarn+2s. labour=3s. The 100 yards cost 300s.=£15. If the rate of 
surplus value amounts to half the labour, the profit on 
1 yard=ls. =  1/3 of the [price of the] product. Or, calculated on the 
outlay, the rate of profit is Is.:2 = 50%. On the 100 yards it is 
100s.=£5 =  5 men. 
b) 10 M produce 300 yards, 1 man 30 yards; 1 yard 
therefore=Vso M= 20/s0s.=2/3S. A single yard therefore costs Is. 
(yarn, etc.)+2/3s. (labour) = l2/3s. The 300 yards cost 300 (l+2/3) or 
500s.=£25.  Rate of surplus value as previously, thus the surplus 
value on 1 yard is  2/eS.  = ih of the product. Or, calculated on the 
outlay, it is 2/6 or 73s. to  ls.  + Vs= 4/3S. Therefore the rate of 
profit=l:4=25%. On the 300 yards,=300 (l+2/3s.) =  500s.,  this 
makes 300/3 s.=£5 =  5 M as above.

26 Capital and Profit 
In this case, I [b)], the rate of profit falls, the amount of profit on 
a single yard falls from Is. to '/ss., from '/20 M to 1/eo M. The amount 
of profit on the whole product remains the same. 
Case II. The price of yarn, etc., falls under the 2nd mode of 
production in line with the [rise in the] productivity of the 
weaving, hence a 3fold fall. The yarn, etc., for the 300 yards then 
costs as much as it cost previously for 100, namely 100s. A yard 
therefore costs 7ss. yarn, etc.+2/3s. labour=ls. The 300 yards cost 
300s.=£15,  as in case a) of I. The profit='/3S. = 7s of the product. 
Or, calculated on the outlay, 7s against 2I$=50%, which is the rate 
of profit. 
In this case the rate of profit remains the same, while the 
amount of profit on a single  yard,  compared with la), falls from Is. to 
'/ss. The amount of profit on the whole product remains the same, 
for 300/3=l00s.=£5 = 5 M. 
Case III. The price of yarn, etc., remains the same as under I, 
while the rate of surplus value undergoes a threefold increase with 
the tripling of productivity: 
Yarn for the 300 yards costs 300s. One yard costs Is. yarn+2/3s. 
labour= l2/ss., as under I b). But now only 73,=2/9S., of the 2/3S. 
labour represents wages. Hence the profit=4/9[s.]=2/s of the 
product=40% on the product.30 [XV-952] The outlay is Is. 
yarn+2/9 wages=u/9S. And the profit is 4/9; the ratio is therefore 
4:11,  which gives a rate of profit of 36*/u%. The rate of profit is 
lower than in I a) and II, but higher than in I b). 
The 300 yards cost 300 (l+2/3)=500s.=£25, as in I b). The 
amount of profit on a single yard is 4/gs., whereas under I a) it came 
to Is.; under I b) it was 73s., under II it was '/3s- Therefore in 
comparison with I a), at %, it has fallen by over a  half;  in 
comparison with I b), at VsS., or 3/9, it has risen by V9; and 
similarly in comparison with II, where the amount of profit was 
also VsS., or 3/9. The amount of profit on the whole product rises 
from 100s. to 133'/ss. It is now 62/s  M instead of 5 M. 
Case IV. The price of yarn falls in the new mode of production, 
and similarly the rate of wages, in the same proportion as the 
productivity of labour grows. 
As before, there are 10 men producing 300 yards. 1 M for 
30 yards. 1 yard =  7so M. 
The price of yarn =  '/3S. Therefore the price of yarn, etc., for the 
300 yards=30%s. = 100s., as under I and II. The price of the 
product='/ss. yarn+  730 M, or 7ss. yarn+20/30s. =  73 + 2/3=ls.,  as 
under II and I a).31 But out of this Is., or  9/9s.,  4/g are profit. And 
if we calculate the outlay, we have  73S.  + 2/gS. wages, or 3/9+2/9, or

5/g. The profit is therefore in the ratio  ik:bl9,  or 4:5,  = a rate of prof it 
of 80%. The amount of profit on a single yard is V9S., as under III, 
hence higher than under I b) and II but it continues to be more than 
50% lower than under I a). The amount of profit on the whole 
product=300x4/9=133'/s, = 62/3 M, hence as under III. 
If we now compare these 4 cases with each other, we see that in 
all those cases where the productivity of labour grows, there is a 
decline not only in the value of the individual commodity and 
therewith in its price, but in the amount of profit in proportion to the 
individual commodity, whether the rate of profit rises or falls. The 
same labour produces 3 times the product; hence 2/3 less labour is 
contained in the individual product, and since the amount of 
profit can be nothing other than a portion of this quantity of 
labour contained in the individual commodity, the amount of prof it 
on the individual commodity must decline. In all the cases the 
amount of profit on the whole product does not fall below the 
original amount of profit, for the number of products increases in 
the same proportion as the amount of profit on the individual 
product declines. 
The amount of profit remains the same as long as the rate of 
exploitation remains the same, and the same number of workers 
are employed, however the amount of profit is divided among the 
number of commodities; there is no change either in the amount 
or in the division of that amount between workers and capitalist. 
Thus under I a), with 100 yards and a profit of Is. per yard, a 
profit of 100s. or £5 results; the same with 300 yards and a profit 
of V3S. under I b) and II. 
In comparing II with I a) we found that the rate of profit remained 
the same, for in the 2nd case the profit on an outlay of 3s. was Is. 
and in the other case it was Vss. on 2/3s. outlay. This happens 
when, firstly, the rate of wages remains the same, but, secondly, 
when, as labour becomes more productive in a particular sphere, it 
becomes more productive in the same proportion in the spheres 
which provide constant capital, yarn, etc. In this case the rate of 
profit remains the same because the proportional values of the raw 
material, etc., contained in the individual commodity and of paid 
labour, the proportion between the two, remains the same; just as 
does the ratio between paid [XV-953] and unpaid labour. 
In I b), where the productivity of weaving increases threefold 
and wages remain the same, but the yarn, etc., retains its old price, 
we have a fall in the rate of profit. In this case the rate of profit 
falls from 50% to 25%, by half therefore. It falls because the value 
of the added labour32 falls in relation to the value and not merely 

=====第40页=====
30 Capital and Profit 
in relation to the quantity (as under II) of the constant capital 
applied,  and the division of this added labour between capitalist 
and worker remains the same; under II, where the rate of profit 
remains the same, the total price of the individual commodity falls 
in the same proportion as the productivity of labour [rises]. 
Previously33 the yard cost 3s., under II it costs Is. Under I b), in 
contrast, it costs l2/ss. Here, therefore, where the rate of profit falls, 
the total price of the commodity does not fall in the same 
proportion as the productivity of labour in the weaving process 
[increases]. 
We have equally a fall in the rate of profit under III, where 
wages fall in the same proportion as the productivity of labour 
[rises].  But raw materials, etc., remain the same here as before the 
threefold increase in the productivity of labour, as under I a). 
The value of the whole of the labour34 falls here in relation to the 
constant capital, and with it the rate of profit too. But the amount of 
profit on the whole product rises here, whereas in the 3 cases I a), 
I b), and II, it remained the same. 
The amount of profit, namely, in I a),= lOOx Is.= 100s. In I b) 
it=300x73s. =  100s.  And in II it=300 yardsxV3s.= 100s; namely in 
I a) the number is 100 yards (= 100s.)X Is. In I b) the number is 
300 yards  X 73=100s. And in II the number is 300 yardsx'/s-
Nevertheless, the yard costs 3s. in the first case, l2As. in the 2nd, 
and only Is. in the 3rd. In the first case as in the third the 
profit=73 of the product. 
In Case III the amount of profit rises, for 300 Ch) is more than 
100X1 or 300 (7s), which only=300x3/9. The amount of profit on 
the individual [product] has fallen (compared with I a)) from 9/9 to 
*/g; more than a  half.  But the number of yards has tripled. The 
amount of profit on a single yard has therefore not fallen in the 
same proportion as the number of yards has increased. Hence an 
increase in the amount of profit on the product taken as a whole. 
In Case IV, finally, the price falls as under II to a 3rd of I a), 
from 3s. to Is. But there is a rise in the rate of profit and the 
amount of profit on the whole product. The amount of profit on the 
individual yard, as under III,=4/9S., but this amount of profit 
forms a higher rate on the constant capital in the individual yard. 
Let us put these results together.35 
[XV-956] 36 These results follow from the foregoing investigation: 
If the increase in the productive power of labour has an equal effect 
on all components of the commodity, as under II and IV, the 
price of the commodity will fall in the same proportion as the 
productivity of labour increases. In this case, therefore, where the

32 Capital  and  Profit 
productivity  of labour  is tripled,  the  price  of the  individual yard 
undergoes  a 3fold reduction,  it falls from  3s. to Is.  Similarly,  the 
ratio of the  IMMEDIATE LABOUR  contained in the commodity to the 
REALISED LABOUR contained  in it  remains  the  same.  If for  that reason 
the value  of the  wage remains  the  same,  or the  ratio between paid 
and unpaid labour,  the  division  of the  product  of the  IMMEDIATE 
LABOUR between capitalist  and  worker, then  the  ratio between variable 
and constant capital also remains  the  same, hence  the  rate  of profit. 
Compare  II with  I a). 
//, on the  other  hand,  wages  (the  value  of labour capacity),  and 
therefore  the  necessary labour time, fall  in the  same proportion  as 
the productivity  of labour grows  (the  middle stages,  e.g. a  fall,  but not 
a very deep  one,  only bring about  a modification  in the  level),  the 
rate of profit will rise,  as in IV, and the  amount  of profit  on the 
whole product will grow.  (The  rate  of profit=the ratio  of the 
amount  of profit  to the  capital laid  out.) 
This  is the  situation with cases  II and IV,  where  the  price falls 
from  3s. to Is.; in II the  rate  of profit remains  the  same  and the 
total amount  of profit ditto;  in IV the  rate  of profit rises  and the 
total amount  of profit ditto. 
I b) and III, in  contrast, both represent cases  in which  the 
productivity  of labour  is multiplied  by three  in the  FINISHING  PROCESS, 
but the  value  of raw  material,  etc.,  remains UNALTERED. Here there  is 
a reduction  in lb): if  wages remain  the  same,  the  proportion  of 
variable  to constant capital falls  to the  same degree  as constant 
capital grows. Hence  a fall in the  rate  of profit.  If, as in III, the 
value  of labour falls,37  the  rate  of profit admittedly falls, because 
the surplus value  is calculated  on a  greater total capital.  But, 
firstly,  the  total capital does  not  rise  as high  as in I b),  where 
firstly  the  constant capital rises from  100 to 300 and  secondly  the 
variable capital,  100,  remains  the  same,  the  total capital therefore 
rising  by 200 (the  excess  of the  constant capital  in I b)  over  the 
constant capital  in la);  whereas  the  surplus value remains  the 
same  as in I a);  whereas  in III the  constant capital admittedly rises 
from  100 to 300, but the  variable capital,  in contrast, falls from 
100 to 662/s,  the  total capital therefore does  not  rise by the  whole 
amount  of the  growth  of the  constant capital;  and,  secondly,  the 
surplus value grows from  100 to  133'/s, therefore rises  by 3373% 
in comparison with  I a). The  rate  of profit therefore falls,  but not 
in the  same proportion  as in I b), and the  amount  of profit  on the 
whole thing rises, because  the  rate  of profit  is admittedly lower 
than in I a), but the  AGGREGATE surplus value  is greater,  or, in  other 
words,  the  rate  of profit  in III  falls  in a  lesser proportion,  as 

=====第43页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 33 
compared with I a), than the total capital advanced in III rises, as 
compared with I a). 
We can therefore see that with a fall in the price of  the individual 
commodity resulting from an increase in the productivity of labour 
and therefore a simultaneous increase in the numbers of these 
LOWER-PRICED COMMODITIES, the rate of profit may fall, or rise, or 
remain the same. At least the AGGREGATE amount of profit remains 
always the same, if the same number of workers remain in 
employment (and wages do not rise); it may rise if the further 
condition is added to these that wages fall as the productivity of 
labour increases. But the aggregate amount of profit only remains 
equal under the condition that the same number of workers 
remains in employment. This is only possible, in case no  CHANGE  OF 
VALUE  occurs in the constant capital, if the capital outlay is 
increased. For example, compare I b) with I a). If the expendable 
capital remained the same in I b) as it was in I a), namely 200, the 
amount of profit could not remain the same. SU of this 200 would 
now have to be laid out in constant capital, and V4 in variable 
capital. Therefore 150 in constant capital and 50 in variable 
capital. 100 represented 10 M; 50 would therefore only represent 
5.38 And we should have: 
Constant Variable Surplus Product Number of Price of Rate of Amount of 
capital capital value yards yard profit profit 
150[s.] 50[s.] 50s. 250s. 150 12/Ss. 25% 50[s.] 
The capital laid out would be the same. The number of yards 
would have grown from 100 to 150, hence by 50%; the amount of 
profit, on the other hand, would have fallen from 100 to 50, 
hence by 50. The exploitation of labour would remain the same; 
hinc the rate of surplus value too. Both the amount of profit and 
the rate of profit can remain the same if, as in II, productivity 
grows simultaneously and in the same measure in those branches of 
industry which produce constant capital and those which  USE  IT UP. 
It can only grow if, apart from this condition, another is added to it, 
that there is a fall in wages. 
[XV-954] 36 It would appear, according to this, that the rate of 
profit cannot fall unless: 
1) the relative value of labour capacity rises (while the value of the 
constant capital remains the same). This is Ricardo's assertion, but 
he does not include the restrictive clause, without which the 
statement is absolutely incorrect.39 
2) or there is a rise in the value of constant capital in relation to 
variable. And the latter would appear to be restricted to cases 

=====第44页=====
34 Capital and Profit 
where the productive power of labour does not rise equally and 
simultaneously in all the branches of production which contribute 
to produce the commodity. 
Let us assume a threefold increase in productivity in spinning 
and weaving. If productivity in the production of cotton itself is 
simultaneously tripled, the proportion of constant to variable 
capital so  FAR remains the same (in so far as the raw material comes 
into consideration). If £100 can command 10 40  men, and these ten 
previously worked up cotton for £300, and they now work up 3 
times as much cotton, 3 times x cotton now cost only £300, which 
is what x cotton cost previously, since the value of cotton has fallen 
three times. Even in this case a fall in profit would prove not that 
the yield of cotton cultivation had declined, but only that it had 
not become more productive in the same ratio as cotton manufac­
turing. Therefore only a relative reduction in its productivity, 
despite the absolute increase in it. Ricardo, however, thinks that 
agriculture must become more unproductive absolutely. It would 
only demonstrate that industry and agriculture do not develop to 
the same degree in bourgeois production. If they do not do this, 
that alone is sufficient to explain the decline in the rate of profit. 
But the presupposition that the value of constant capital, despite 
the increase in its amount, falls in the same proportion as the 
productivity of labour increases, can be reduced to the presupposi­
tion that the value of constant capital consists of present labour alone, 
and no past labour enters into reproduction. The value of the past 
labour does indeed fall once its product can be reproduced more 
cheaply. If, with a threefold increase in the productivity of 
spinning, a worker sets 1,800 spindles into action instead of 600, it 
must be assumed that 1,800 spindles could now be reproduced 
with the same labour as was required previously for 600. We shall 
postpone any further discussion of this question, and pass on to 
why we took up this investigation again at all at this point. 
We have seen that in all cases where the productivity of labour 
grows, hence the same amount of labour is represented in a 
greater quantity of commodities, hence the price of the individual 
commodity falls (because the value does), the amount of profit made 
on the individual commodity is reduced, whether the rate of profit 
rises,  falls, or stays the same, and even if there is an increase in 
the amount of profit on the total product. 
//It turns out, incidentally, that the investigation always goes 
awry when one looks at the price of the individual commodity in  itself. 
Or when one merely measures the labour IN  REGARD-TO  THE  QUANTITY  OF 
COMMODITY PRODUCED BY IT. Everything depends on the magnitude of 

=====第45页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 35 
the total amount of capital laid out. Even if we analyse the price of 
the individual commodity, e.g. in the above case, where the price 
of the yard falls from 3s. to l 2/ss.; if we know that ls.=yarn, etc., 
73s.=wages and  V3S.  = profit, we do not know whether the total 
amount of profit has remained the same or not. For example, in 
case I b), if the capital laid out continues to be, as before, only 
200,  the amount of profit falls; if it is 400 it remains the same. 
Even in case III, if the capital remains the same at this price of 
12/3S.  per yard, while the rate of wages is reduced, the amount of 
profit on the whole product does not grow. 
The situation would then be as follows: 
Constant Variable Surplus Product Number of Price of Rate of Amount of 
capital capital value yards yard profit profit 
163'/,,  364/,,  728/n  2728/,,  163'/,,  l2/ss.  36*/,,  728/,, 
Total capital is 200 instead of 100 as previously.41// 
[XV-955] The phenomenon—which derives from the nature of 
capitalist production—that with a growing productive power of 
labour the price of the individual commodity falls, the number of 
commodities increases, the amount of profit on the individual 
commodities declines in all circumstances, the rate of profit rises, falls 
or remains the same, but the amount of profit on the total number of 
commodities remains the same or grows (even when it falls in the 
cases we have explained, in which the capital ought to have grown 
but remains the same, it in fact remains the same or grows, because 
the capitalist who applies the improved mode of production sells 
below the old market price alias above his own individual 
production price, until competition has balanced this out; the 
second requisite, the growth of the capital laid out, proceeds hand 
in hand with this period of adjustment)—this phenomenon only 
presents itself on the surface in: a fall in the amount of profit on 
the individual commodity, a fall in its price, a stable or growing 
amount of profit on the increased total number of commodities. 
This is conceived in such a way that the capitalist, of his own free 
choice, adds less profit on each single commodity but finds 
compensation through the increased number of commodities he 
sells.  This view rests on the notion of "PROFIT UPON ALIENATION",17 
which is in turn for its part abstracted from the attitude of mind 
of merchants' capital, of commercial capital. If a merchant were to 
sell 100 yards, which cost him 3s. per yard (I a)), hence 300s. per 
year, with a 10% increase in the price, he would make a profit of 
30s. And he would sell one yard at 3s.  33/5d.  (33/5d. or 18/5d. or 36/io 
of a penny=s/,0s., since 3s.=3x 12d.=36d., hence 3/i0s.=36/,0d.). If,

in contrast, he sells 300 yards (case II), each yard costing him Is., 
he must equally make a profit of 30s. in order to gain 10% on the 
capital of 300s. But whereas the first merchant adds  3/i0s.  to each 
yard, this one only needs to add VioS.; the first merchant adds 
33/sd.,  he only adds  l'/sd.  He therefore sells a yard at Is.  l'/sd., 
whereas the first merchant sells it at 3s.  33/5d.,  and he makes the 
same profit thereby as the first merchant. If he sold at Is.  l'/sd., 
he would make a much greater profit than the other, despite 
adding much less to the individual yard, and even so he would still 
sell it more than twice as cheap. 
If we now look at merchants' capital as a whole, e.g. here the 
whole section of MERCANTILE CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE SELLING  OF LINEN, it is 
clear that it by no means depends on merchants' capital whether it 
has 100 or 300 yards to sell, and whether it has to advance 300s. 
for 100 yards or for 300, whether its cost price per yard is Is. or 
3s., and it therefore depends just as little on merchants' capital 
whether it makes its 10% profit by adding  39/5 d. per item on a 
smaller number of yards or  l'/sd.  per item on a greater number. 
The rate of surcharge itself—again from the point of view of the 
whole—depends just as little on the merchant; it is determined 
rather by the general law of AVERAGE PROFIT, namely that he can 
obtain the same profit, e.g. 10%, for capital of equal magnitude, 
whatever particular sphere it may be invested in, and however 
much or however little labour it may set in motion. This is just as 
valid for capital which remains constantly in the process of 
circulation as it is, let us say, for fixed capital, which never (in 
natura) dwells anywhere but in the sphere of the direct process of 
production. The production price of industrial capital appears as the 
cost price for commercial capital. But since industrial capital does 
actually buy, does replace on the market the elements, in part of 
its constant capital, in part of its variable capital (the latter in so 
far as the value of labour capacity is determined by the price of 
the worker's means of consumption)—and since these elements 
pass from the hands of the merchant into the hands [XV-957] 42 of 
the industrialist, it is clear that not only does the production price 
of one commodity pass over into the cost price of the other, but 
the industrial production price of one commodity together with the 
commercial addition to this price appear as an element in the cost 
price of the other commodity. 
The industrial production price of one commodity always enters 
into the cost price of the other, even when the industrialists 
exchange directly, without the interposition of merchants. The 
weaver, for example, pays the production price of the yarn. This

therefore forms an outlay for him, it enters into his constant 
capital, it is an advance for him, an element in the cost price. It is 
therefore not only in the form of interest that  SURPLUS  VALUE,  even 
from the point of view of the individual capitalist, forms a part of 
his advances, enters into the cost price of his commodity. But this 
is also the case for all the elements of his constant capital, and for 
wages (variable capital) in so far as the value of labour capacity is 
determined by the production price of the worker's means of 
consumption. 
Profit—and therefore the difference between price of produc­
tion and cost price—appears to him as a surplus over the cost price 
only as regards his own commodity. As regards all the other 
commodities which enter into the price of production of his own 
commodity, their cost price, hence the costs of his production, 
appear to him as determined by the price of production, and profit 
therefore appears as an element which enters into the price of 
production, not as a result which emerges from it. 
This is the case if the price of production is considered quite 
independently of the interposition of merchants' capital. But how 
do things stand with the latter's inclusion? Is the additional charge 
it makes to be regarded as a merely nominal raising of the price over 
the value, or how otherwise? If this is the case on an average— 
since the commercial price of the commodities enters as an 
element into their reproduction—then all commodities are sold 
above their value. For included in the price of production are, 
1) the whole of the capital advanced, and 2) the whole of the 
surplus value, divided among the different capitals pro rata* their 
magnitude. But, firstly, the capital advanced consists of the 
objectified labour in the means of labour, etc., secondly it is 
replaced by an equal quantity of living labour (wages), and thirdly 
the whole of the surplus value comprises the totality of the surplus 
labour. So if yet a further element is added to this, which raises 
the price of production, the price of the total commodity is>than its 
value, and the price of the individual commodity>than its price of 
production, i.e. greater than its price as determined by the value of 
the total commodity. But this seems to be the case with commercial 
capital. 
A distinction must be made in dealing with capital included in 
the process of circulation.

to be found in practice plus ou moins* bound up with it, which 
belong to the  process  of production  itself,  although they do not proceed 
in the workshop of the producer. 
The first of these functions is the transport industry (THE CARRIAGE 
OF COMMODITIES). The use value of the commodity is admittedly in its 
finished form, but this use value does nevertheless undergo an 
alteration. Its location, its spatial existence, is changed. This process 
belongs to the process of production  itself.  The commodity is not 
on the market, hence is not yet in circulation, before it has passed 
through this change of location. Everything that occurs in 
connection with this process belongs to the process of production. 
Secondly: The use value of the commodity must first be divided 
into the amounts appropriate to it as use value, it must be 
separated out, before the commodity really exists as a commodity. 
1 qr of wheat, for example, first exists as a quarter when a quarter 
has been weighed out from the total amount of wheat, etc. This 
measuring, weighing, real reduction of the commodity to the units 
of measurement which are appropriate to it as a use value—and 
which at first only exist notionally—forms a part of the 
preparation of the commodity, a part of its process of production. It 
is a process which the commodity must pass through before it is 
present wholesale or retail as a commodity, and it is an operation 
which use value [XV-958] must itself pass through before it is 
ready as use value of the commodity. Since capitalist production 
produces on a large scale, whereas individual consumption takes 
place on a small scale, this operation constitutes a very significant 
part of the RETAIL trade. The packer, WAREHOUSEMAN, weigher, etc., in 
the workshop belong to the productive workers just as much as do 
the spinner, dyer, etc.; the capital expended on those functions is 
just as much productive capital as that directly laid out for 
spinning, etc. In the same way, this employment of capital, even 
when it takes place and is repeated in capital's sphere of 
circulation, belongs entirely to the process of production of the 
commodity. 
Thirdly: What is the situation with the fixed and circulating 
capital which is necessary for the conservation, storage, preserva­
tion of the commodities whilst they are on the market, hence have 
already left the actual production process and entered the sphere 
of circulation? 
The answer to this is most obvious when we look first at 
commodities which are only placed on the market once a year, 
a More or less.— Ed. 

=====第49页=====
Mercantile  Capital. Money-dealing Capital 39 
because they can only be reproduced once a year, as e.g. corn, 
cotton, etc. If the COTTON IMPORTERS in Liverpool had no WAREHOUSES, 
DOCKS,  etc., the manufacturer in Manchester, etc., would himself 
have to store the quantity of cotton he needed during the year, 
expending on the one hand capital for WAREHOUSES, buildings (fixed 
capital), and on the other hand variable capital, to buy the wage 
labour43 to perform the  OPERATIONS  necessary for the preservation 
of the cotton. Exactly the same situation holds for the miller and 
his corn, the baker and his flour, etc. All these things are conditions 
of production, and the operations and expenses, etc., required for 
conservation and storage themselves belong among the conditions 
of production. The only difference is that a part of the capital 
required for the manufacture of COTTON or bread, which has these 
particular functions allotted to it, is to be found and operates in 
the hands of COTTON  IMPORTERS,  corn dealers, etc., instead of COTTON 
MANUFACTURERS,  MILLERS and BAKERS. But the capitals engaged in these 
functions are directly productive capitals, they are engaged in the 
process of production although they are to be found in the sphere 
of circulation. They are parts of productive capital which are to be 
found OUT OF  DOORS  (i.e. outside the immediate workshop). This is 
true for all capitals invested in  WAREHOUSING,  in so far as the 
commodities WHICH ARE KEPT AND PRESERVED form the elements of a 
further process of production; their WAREHOUSING and PRESERVING 
would be the responsibility of the immediate producer if it had 
not been  MADE  OVER, through the division of labour, TO  OUT  OF DOORS 
CAPITALISTS. 
We come now to the second sort of commodity, those which 
enter directly into individual consumption. It is clear from the 
outset that, in so far as they form the workers' means of 
consumption—IN  FACT variable capital which has shed its monetary 
form—the preservation and WAREHOUSING of these commodities 
belongs among the direct conditions of the process of production. They 
form part of variable capital in exactly the same way as the first 
sort forms part of constant. Therefore the same thing is true here 
as well. But looking now at the  WAREHOUSING  of commodities which 
do not form part either of constant or of variable capital, can we 
say of them that the capital and labour required for this enter the 
direct process of production of the commodities? Certainly not. 
Nevertheless they do enter by a roundabout route. They enter 
into the direct cost of consumption. WAREHOUSING of the first sort 
enters into the cost of industrial consumption, hence of direct 
production; that of the second sort enters into the cost of 
individual consumption, hence the cost of consumption. If all such 
4*

commodities, instead of being bought au fur et à mesure, 3 had to be 
drawn, e.g.  AT ONCE,  to the amount of their production over a year 
e.g., [XV-959] the private consumers would have to expend capital 
for buildings to store them and for wage labour to preserve those 
commodities in a usable condition. Consumption costs en general— 
e.g. the fact that I must have my furniture cleaned, my house 
scrubbed, my meat cooked, my shoes polished—do not enter the 
commodity's process of production and therefore do not enter its 
price of production. They only occur after the commodity has 
ceased to be a commodity and become a mere use value. But in so 
far as the costs of consumption are anticipated the consumer 
receives the commodity in a form ready for consumption, in a 
form in which the price of production requires no additional 
private payment. For example, if yarn is manufactured and linen 
woven at home, the weaving belongs to the cost of consumption of 
the yarn. If it is woven industrially, the weaving process belongs to 
the cost of production. And so it is in the case mentioned above. If 
I have my meat cooked at home, the cooking belongs to its cost of 
consumption. If I get it ready cooked from the cook-sHOP, it 
belongs to its cost of production, it enters into its production 
process, but it also emerges from the production process in a more 
advanced form, and it enters into the process of consumption in a 
more finished form. 
To that extent, then, the  WAREHOUSING  of the second sort of 
commodity, which does not enter as an element into either 
constant or variable capital, is also included in the direct  process  of 
production. And the capital employed therein is directly productive 
capital. Productive capital can in general have 2 meanings: 
1) capital entering directly into the production process; 2) capital 
which enters into the process of reproduction (which includes 
circulation). 
In connection with this 3rd category, capital INVESTED IN  WAREHOUS­
ING (which includes storage and preservation), it must be noted: 
these actions are only more productive in so far as they are 
required by the AVERAGE conditions of production. If instead the 
markets are overstocked, etc., goods cannot be sold, there follows 
a STOPPAGE OF COMMODITIES IN THE CIRCULATING RESERVOIRS; if this results 
from an interruption in the process of circulation, it belongs to the 
faux frais de production h for the industrial producer. It increases the 
cost price for him by contracting the difference between price of 
a Piecemeal as required.— Ed. 
b Overhead costs of production.— Ed.

production  and cost price.  The  FINAL  market price  is not  increased 
thereby,  but,  rather, mostly stands  in an  inverse ratio  to the  faux 
frais, just as do  transport costs, when they arise from blockages  of 
this kind  in the  process  of circulation,  e.g.  when  a commodity 
which  is  sent from Manchester  to  China finds  the  markets 
overstocked there, travels from there  to Australia, suffers  the  same 
fate here,  and is  finally disposed  of in  South America. 
Apart from that, what  all these  INVESTMENTS OF CAPITAL IN TRANSPORT­
ING, DIVIDING ACCORDING  TO MEASURE  AND  WEIGHT,  AND  WAREHOUSING  OF COM­
MODITIES have  in common  is that they  are  employed  in processes 
which directly alter  and  affect  the use  value  of commodities, give  it 
another form, whether through change  of place  or through  a real 
reduction  of the use  value into parts corresponding  to its  natural 
quantities,  or  through  the  preservation  of  that  use  value.  It is 
precisely  the  direct relation  of these processes  to the use  value  of 
the commodity  as use  value which makes them into directly 
productive processes  and the  capital employed  in  them into 
PRODUCTIVE  CAPITAL,  EMPLOYED  IN PECULIAR SPHERES  OF IMMEDIATE  PRODUCTION, 
ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL DIVISION OF LABOUR. 
It was  necessary  to  strip  off  these  FEATURES  OF  THE CIRCULATING 
CAPITAL—in  other words  to separate them from  the  CIRCULATING CAPITAL. 
The processes  of production, which continue within  the  sphere  of 
circulation, extend beyond  the  direct process  of production. This  is 
all the  more necessary  in that  the  capital which functions merely  in 
circulation, merchant's capital especially,  in part combines these 
functions  too  with  its own,  hence does  not  step forth  in its  pure form. 
But after these features have been stripped  off we  have  the  pure 
form  of circulating capital. 
[XV-960] Before  we now  pass  on to  this particular kind  of 
capital,  it must further  be  noted: 
Firstly:  TRANSPORTING, RETAILING (DIVIDING) (MEASURING)  AND  WAREHOUSING 
CAPITAL,  which have  the  appearance  of belonging  to the  circulation 
process,  are  IN FACT  not  distinguished from other productive capital 
except  in that they form particular spheres, just  as  AGRICULTURAL, 
MINING,  MANUFACTURING  CAPITAL  (alongside their subdivisions) are dis­
tinguished only  as particular spheres; except  in that they create 
different  use  values. This therefore does  not  give rise  to any new 
distinctions  in the  form  of  capital  in  general,4* separate from 
consideration  of the  peculiarities  of its  process  of production 
which arise from  the  nature  of the use  value created  by it. 
Secondly:  As in all  other spheres  of capital, profit here  is derived 
partly from  the  wage labour directly exploited  in these spheres, 
and partly, when  the  organic composition  of the  capital  is not

average, e.g. when it contains less variable, more fixed capital, 
from the share, pro rata the magnitude of the capital, of the 
surplus value created in other spheres of production. 
We come now to the particular shapes of capital which are 
confined within the process of circulation and have absolutely 
nothing to do with the use value of the commodity and THE DIVERS 
DEGREES OF ITS FINISHING. They are not only distinguished as particular 
spheres of application of capital; but they also form a kind of 
capital which is distinct from productive capital as such. 
Since they are only concerned with the functions of the 
circulation process as such, their peculiar functions must be 
explained from the form of metamorphosis of the commodity, 
hence from the movements of form which are peculiar to 
circulation as such. 
Capital is in circulation only qua commodity or qua money; 
commodity or money capital. The movement of the commodity 
(and therefore of commodity capital) is  C— M—C,  selling in order 
to buy, and, in so far as this process is constantly repeated, selling 
in order to buy and buying in order to sell. It is this latter 
movement which makes the metamorphosis of commodities into 
the metamorphosis of commodity capital. For it emerges here that 
what is in question is not only a CHANGE in the form of commodity 
and money, but the preservation and increase of value in this 
process. This is therefore the function of merchants' capital. It 
presents the total movement of the metamorphosis of commodities 
as a movement of commodity capital, and apart from this change 
of form and its movement merchants' capital as merchants' capital 
has no function. 
The second is money, in so far as it possesses functions apart from 
those of being merely means of circulation (the sole form in which 
it functions in merchants' capital (commodity capital) as such, 
namely as the purely evanescent form of the commodity). As I 
showed in the first part,3 this reduces  itself,  these peculiar and 
apparently independent movements of money which emerge from 
the metamorphosis of the commodity reduce themselves, to 
1) hoard formation; 2) the function of money as means of payment; 
3) the functions of money as world money, in which it has a double 
movement, running backwards and forwards between the national

edition, Vol. 29, pp. 359-84).— Ed.

Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 43 
spheres of circulation on the one hand, and movement from its 
sources of production over the world market and the division of 
this influx between the national spheres of circulation [on the 
other]. 
From the standpoint of the exchange of commodities, as we 
have seen,3 hoard formation—viewed merely as a form of money— 
is the petrifaction or autonomisation of the commodity in its first 
metamorphosis. But here as presence of capital, the money which 
is precipitated as hoard is capital (or at least the aliquot part), 
productive capital which has completed its process of production 
and been converted back from money into commodity and from 
commodity into more money. The different determinations of 
money as hoard now appear as determinations of money capital. 
The first form of the hoard, or function of the [XV-961] hoard, 
was to serve as reserve fund of coin. Now, in this quality, in which it 
has to function as means of circulation held READY, i.e. as means of 
purchase, it is the part of circulating capital which the industrial 
capitalist (or commercial, which in respect of money capital is the 
same thing) must always keep in store as money capital, in order to 
defray current expenses—to pay wages, to cover HIS OWN PERSONAL 
EXPENSES (WHAT HE SPENDS  AS REVENUE) and to buy other ingredients of 
production which need to be paid for in cash. 
The second function of money as hoard was to form a reserve 
fund for payments, the fund from which money flows as means of 
payment. We shall soon come to this point when we arrive at 
means of payment. 
The third function of money as hoard was to be a reserve fund of 
world money, a fund of means of purchase or payment in foreign 
markets, and apart from this in particular to represent the form in 
which new supplies of money for the world market are drawn 
from the sources of production of money, etc., in exchange for 
commodities. 
Whether the hoard is to serve as reserve fund for means of 
payment in the home market, or as means of payment and means of 
purchase in the foreign market, this form of functioning as means 
of payment or world money alters absolutely nothing, IN  REGARD  TO THE 
CAPITAL, in the fact that it is the part of circulating capital which the 
industrialist always needs in the form of money, just as in the case 
of the reserve fund of coin. 
Finally: The hoard, in so far as it did not function as reserve 
fund of coin, means of payment and world money, was hoard as 
* Ibid., pp. 359-70.—Ed. 

=====第54页=====
44 Capital and Profit 
such,  the commodity petrified in its first metamorphosis, made 
independent, and conserved. But for capital the hoard is capital 
lying idle—a part of it lying idle in the form of money, which it is 
unable to valorise directly in its own business. For the capitalist, 
who does not share the DELUSIONS of the hoarder, and to whom 
money has value not as absolute form of the commodity but only 
as absolute form of capital—self-valorising and functioning 
value—this form of capital lying idle is unproductive capital, 
loanable capital, which ought at least to be converted into 
interest-bearing capital if he himself is not to utilise it as 
profit-bringing capital. For the capitalist, therefore, it is money 
which is to be found on the market as money capital. It may be 
newly accumulated profit, i.e. profit converted into capital. But a 
part of this capital which lies idle may also flow from rent or other 
sources of income of the unproductive workers (and even of the 
productive ones), who want to sell as capital, i.e. loan out, a part of 
their revenue which is available in money. 
As far as the hoard as such is concerned, whether it serves in 
any particular function or not, it makes only one operation 
necessary, that of preservation. The costs of preservation can be 
reduced to buildings, coffre fort, 1 hence  SOME  fixed capital; the 
counting of the hoard; and if it is large, perhaps the wage labour 
of a number of unproductive workers for the "protection" of the 
hoard, not against moth and rust, but against thieves. 45 
If it is the exclusive task of particular capitals to perform the 
operations which emerge from the circulation of capital, these can 
only be operations which emerge from the functions of circulation 
as such. Functions separated off from the total process of capitalist 
production, peculiar to the process of circulation, and distinguish­
ing it. 
Hence commodity capital, merchants' capital, commodity dealers, as 
the operation of a particular capital, exclusively concerned with 
this, have as such nothing else to do but to buy and sell 
commodities, an operation which costs labour time, but in this case 
lays claim to the whole labour time, both the capitalist's and that of 
his wage labourers, clerks, etc. The movement which represents 
the constant metamorphosis of the commodity appears here as his 
exclusive operation, as proceeding through his mediating activity 
or RATHER the specific activity of capital through which it func­
tions. 
[XV-962] Similarly, the function of a specific capital as money 
a Safe.— Ed. 

=====第55页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 45 
capital, in short the trade in money, can only obtain content from 
the specific functions of money—and therefore of capital as 
money, in its mode of existence as money—as opposed to the 
functions performed by money as a moment of merchants' capital 
(where it always acts as means of purchase). 
These functions are therefore firstly: hoard formation as such, 
which consists merely in the preservation of money precipitated 
from circulation (capital precipitated in the form of money and 
profit or REVENUE in general). We have already seen," in examining 
money, that whereas the money hoard is fragmented in pre-
bourgeois stages of production, within capitalist production it 
becomes centralised in large repositories. This is the first function 
of the money dealer or the trade in money. 
The industrial capitalist (like the commercial capitalist) must 
constantly have READY a definite part of his circulating capital in the 
form of money capital, i.e. as hoard (in its form), as a reserve fund 
for coin and means of payment, whether at home or abroad. And 
this part stands in a definite proportion to the scale on which he 
produces, e.g. to the wages he has to pay every week, etc. And the 
magnitude of the cash operations currently in progress, e.g. with 
the merchant. But although this part is determinate (changing of 
course at different moments of reproduction), it is dissolved again 
and again, i.e. as means of purchase and means of payment (here 
as payment of the balance) its form as hoard is dissolved, the 
hoard is emptied, and in turn constantly refilled by the sale of 
commodities or payment for sold commodities. Its parts therefore 
change constantly; on the one hand it dissolves as means of 
purchase and means of payment, on the other hand it is constantly 
reconstituted by the constant conversion of the commodity back 
into money.  C'est  un continuel va-et-vient b; by no means the static 
hoard of the hoarder. Thus the second function of the trade in 
money consists in constantly receiving the money taken in by the 
industrialist and the merchant, collecting it as a hoard, and 
constantly returning it as means of purchase or payment. This 
operation makes accountancy necessary, constant payment and 
calculation. This movement of the hoard (money capital)—its 
constant formation and dissolution—and the maintenance of an 
equilibrium between the two, is mediated by the activity of the 
money dealer, who does nothing else. In so far as money in 
a K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One (present 
edition, Vol. 29, p. 370).—Ed.

46 Capital and Profit 
particular functions as means of payment—a function in which, as 
we explained previously,3 reciprocal claims have to be calculated, 
and only the balance has to be paid in money—the money dealer 
has to perform this function of money as means of payment, 
to settle the claims, at one time to pay money as a balance, at an­
other time to accept money as a balance. This balancing and me­
diating operation of money as means of payment is particularly 
developed in capitalist production, where the whole of production 
is based on exchange value, on circulation, and therefore accounts 
must constantly be settled among the producers (and the mer­
chants). 
In so far as payment or buying on the foreign market makes 
special operations necessary, necessitates, creates special forms of 
transmitting the balance or of money as means of purchase (rate 
of exchange, etc.) these again form a particular function of the 
money trade. 
In the same way, the RETURN of money from the sources of 
production in exchange for commodities can achieve indepen­
dence as a separate operation and function (BULLION dealing, etc.). 
This is in turn a particular function of the money trade. 
Finally, money which lies idle is lent out, i.e. thrown onto the 
market as money capital; it is borrowed by others, and this 
appears in turn—in different forms (LOAN, DISCOUNT, etc.)—as a 
particular function of the money trade, which is thus at once for 
loanable money capital the same thing as the merchant is for 
commodities, the intermediary through which supply of and 
demand for money capital are balanced out and centralised. 
Lastly, we may add yet a further point: Money as world money 
sheds its national [XV-963] character as the money of a particular 
country, and is reduced to its gold and silver content, while gold 
and silver, as the two commodities which circulate as world money, 
have simultaneously to be reduced to the ratio of their values, 
which constantly changes. This, too, happens through the media­
tion of the money dealer, who makes it his particular business to 
perform this adjustment of national money to world money. (Rate 
of exchange; in this case the current state of the balance of 
payments is a further factor, but this is a detail which does not 
belong here.46) On the other hand, this operation too ultimately 
comes down to the simple exchange for each other of the kinds of 
money used in different countries, just as within a single country 
a K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One (present 
edition, Vol. 29, pp. 377-78).— Ed. 

=====第57页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 47 
the kinds of money belonging to the various particular spheres of 
circulation are exchanged. (Simple money changers.) All these 
functions together form the business of the money trade, which 
splits in turn into different branches, just as the commodity trade 
does. 
Just as the operations of the commodity dealer (merchant) are 
absolutely nothing but the independent form of the movements, 
functions, the commodity and therefore capital in its shape of 
commodity capital must pass through in the whole of its process of 
circulation or the movements of its metamorphosis as a whole; in 
the same way the operations of the money dealer (operations of 
specific money capital) are absolutely nothing but the movements 
which flow from the functions of money as such as opposed to 
itself as means of circulation (in the way that it functions in 
trading capital), hence they also fall within the sphere of capital in 
its shape as money, as money capital. 
It therefore appears in fact from a more exact analysis—//the 
sale of money as capital too, the throwing of money into 
circulation as capital, only initiates the process of production, 
which proceeds from money; that this representation of capital as 
initiating the whole process in the form of money appears here as 
a particular function, that the person who lends the money throws 
it into production or circulation as capital only indirectly, through 
the industrial capitalist or merchant, this intermediate operation, 
the changing hands of the money before it opens the process, does 
not change the essence of the matter at all//—that trading capital, 
i.e. commodity capital as a specific capital, and on the other hand 
money capital, as capital which is INVESTED AND SHUT UP in a specific 
business, the money trade—that these are nothing but independent 
modes of existence of these forms of money capital and 
commodity capital, which productive capital assumes in passing 
through the whole of the reproduction process, the forms which it 
assumes in its own sphere of circulation, in the interval between 
leaving the actual process of production and returning to it. 
Nothing can be more incorrect than to view COMMERCIAL  CAPITAL 
and  MONEYED  CAPITAL  (here in the sense of the money trade) as 
particular departments of  PRODUCTIVE  CAPITAL,  somewhat in the same 
way as MINING, FISHING, FARMING, MANUFACTURING, ETC, CAPITAL. It is rather 
that every PRODUCTIVE CAPITAL is COMMERCIAL  CAPITAL,  in so far as it passes 
through the whole movement of its process of production, 
C—M—C or M—C—M, and is looked at in this form in 
isolation. It is in fact its form as  CIRCULATING  CAPITAL,  this being 
viewed as a unity of the opposed phases of the metamorphosis.

Similarly, every productive capital  is MONEYED CAPITAL  in one  phase, 
whether this takes  the  form  of M—M', or in so far as the 
functions which  it performs  in its  form  of  money, hence  its 
monetary functions,  are  viewed  in isolation. Moreover, productive 
capital does  not  cease  to perform  the  functions  of  COMMERCIAL CAPITAL 
and to appear in one phase as  COMMERCIAL CAPITAL  because of the 
interposition of  COMMERCIAL  CAPITAL  as a particular kind of capital, 
capital  INVESTED  IN A  PECULIAR SPHERE  AND  MANAGED  BY A  PECULIAR  SET  OF 
CAPITALISTS;  or because of the interposition of  MONEYED  CAPITAL  as a 
particular kind  of capital,  the  capital  of the  money dealers; just  as 
little does it cease to be  MONEYED CAPITAL  and to perform the 
functions of  MONEYED CAPITAL. 
[XV-964]  A  reduplication therefore takes place  (at  least  in 
appearance).  COMMERCIAL  CAPITAL  (commodity capital) and  MONEYED 
CAPITAL1  are on the one  hand general formal determinations  of 
productive capital,  and the  particular movements  it passes through 
as COMMERCIAL CAPITAL  (commodity trade) and  MONEYED  capital (money 
trade)  are  particular functions which productive capital performs 
in its  process  of reproduction  in both those forms.  On the  other 
hand, particular capitals (therefore also  PECULIAR  SETS  OF CAPITALISTS)  are 
exclusively engaged, whether in the form of  COMMERCIAL  CAPITAL  or 
in the form of  MONEYED  CAPITAL.  AS particular forms of productive 
capital  in general, they also become  the  spheres  of particular capitals; 
particular spheres  of the  valorisation  of capital. 
It is well known that,  STRICTLY SPEAKING,  a banker does  not  need  to 
possess  any  capital  of his own  besides  the  capital  of his  customers; 
and it is a  fact  not  less well known that  e.g.  commercial  AGENTS  only 
administer  the  capital  of  their customers  (the  industrialists)  as 
MANAGERS,  and do not  need  to  have  any  particular capital  in 
addition  to  this.  GENERALLY  speaking,  the  private capital  of 
commerçants  and  BANKERS  is only  the  basis  on  which  an  immense 
superstructure  is erected,  and it  bears  no  relation  at all  (the  larger 
it is, the  less the  relation)  to the  capital  of other people, which they 
turn over,  and  with which they conduct their business. 
Assume that  a merchant possesses £1,000  of capital  and  turns  it 
over 40  times  in the  year;  in the  course  of the  year  he will lay out 
a money capital  of £40,000,  and  purchase commodity capital  to 
the amount  of  £40,000,  so  that altogether  a capital  of £80,000 
passes through  his  hands. This turnover  of  merchants' capital  (in sô 
far as it  relates  to the £1,000 which form  the  specific capital  of the 
merchant)  is very different from  the  turnover  of  productive capital.  In 
a Marx adds  the  German equivalent  in brackets.—  Ed.

fact it represents nothing but the law of the circulation of money, 
that the quantity of prices realised by the money is represented by 
the rapidity of its circulation, by the number of circuits it performs 
within a given period. What is true of money in general—money 
as means of circulation, as means of purchase and means of 
payment, and this is how it functions in MERCANTILE capital—is true 
here as a function of capital. Admittedly, it makes a profit with 
each turnover, and this is what makes the sum of money WITH  WHICH 
HE STARTS  into capital //For the individual merchant, who can seize 
hold of a greater or lesser amount of the total business and make 
a SURPLUS PROFIT because his counterpart makes a smaller than 
AVERAGE PROFIT, it is correct to say: If the rate of profit and the 
prices of commodities are given, the total amount of his profit 
depends on the number of turnovers in the year or the amount of 
business he does. If the rate of profit and the number of 
turnovers are given, it depends on the prices of the commodities. 
If prices and number of turnovers are given, it depends on the 
rate of profit//, but this profit too is determined in another 
manner than in the case of productive capital. The turnover of 
productive capital is by no means an expression of the number of 
circuits performed by money as means of circulation. It is rather 
the opposite: the number of circuits of money is here an 
expression of the frequency of renewal of the process of 
reproduction, of how often money is converted into capital. Here 
it turns over a given number of times because it functions as 
capital a given number of times. In commercial capital it functions 
a given number of times as capital because it turns over a given 
number of times. The number of turnovers is therefore important 
with productive capital because they express the number of 
periods within which the creation of surplus value, hence of profit, 
is repeated. Here the turnover enters the rate of profit as a 
determining factor, because it expresses the circulation time within 
which capital exploits a definite quantity of labour, appropriates 
unpaid labour. The turnover itself has nothing to do with the 
creation of profit. It expresses rather 1) the periods of its 
realisation; and 2) the degree to which labour time is limited by 
circulation time. With COMMERCIAL CAPITAL there are two points to 
make. Firstly: Profit is only made through turnover, which 
represents nothing but the circulation of money; the number of 
circuits performed by the same sum of money; i.e. the repetition of the 
acts of buying and selling. Even the simple C — M—C" in the 
circulation process of productive capital has another meaning. C is 
the result of the process of production, the commodity which 

=====第60页=====
50 Capital and Profit 
results from the process of production; C, in contrast, is the 
commodities which enter as elements of the commodity into its 
process of production, which represent its conditions of produc­
tion. But, as against this, looking at C— M—C" in commercial 
capital, C is distinguished from C" only as price, not as commodity, 
[XV-965] and even if C is another use value, the relation of this 
to C is no different from if it were the same use value. 
Secondly, however, although the profit is made here by the 
turnover  itself,  not first realised within the turnover, as was the 
case with productive capital, the number of turnovers is not a 
factor in determining the rate of profit here, but rather the 
opposite. The (AVERAGE) rate of profit determines the profit on each 
individual turnover. If the general rate of profit is e.g. 10%, that 
is also the rate of profit of merchants' capital. For a merchants' 
capital of e.g. £1,000 to realise a profit of 10% over the year, it 
may only take, if it turns over ten times, a profit of 1% in each 
turnover on a quantity of commodities of £100, hence adding 10 
to 1,000.  Thus, for example, only £7ioo on a commodity priced at 
£1=2%OOS.=2/IOS. =  1/5S-  = 2 /5d. If it turned over 20 times, it would 
need to make only 1/2% on each turnover, for 20x72=10. 72 per 
100 is 10 /ä or 5 on  1,000.  Thus on a commodity priced at £1, for 
example, it is only £72oo= 2°/2oos.=2/2os. =  7ios.  = l 7sd. The average 
number of turnovers in the different spheres of the trade in 
commodities is presupposed as given here. Thus in merchants' 
capital everything appears entirely on the surface. 
Let us now take, e.g., the rotation of a capital in the 
manufacture of CALICO. The product, 10,000 yards of calico=(e.g.) 
£1,000. The manufacturer sells these 10,000 yards to a MERCHANT, a 
CLOTHDEALER, who pays him £1,000. (We shall ignore credit as not 
yet developed.) The 10,000 yards of calico are now in the hands of 
the MERCHANT, and they represent there commodity  capital,  merchants' 
capital. In the hands of the MANUFACTURER they represented 
CAPITAL+PROFIT. Let this MERCHANT be MERCHANT I. The manufacturer 
now uses his £1,000 to buy yarn for £700, coal, etc., for £100, and 
with a further £100 he buys labour.43  The remaining £100 he 
spends as revenue. If we analyse the latter transaction further, we 
find that,  BY and  BY, au fur et à mesure* as the workers receive the 
£100,  they buy commodities from épicier, just as the manufacturer 
buys means of consumption from the épicier with his £100. 
MERCHANT II, the yarn  dealer,  now has £700 instead of the yarn, his 
commodity capital. The same applies to the coal dealer,  MERCHANT  in, 
a Gradually.—£d.

Mercantile  Capital. Money-dealing Capital 51 
who has £100 instead of his coal, and finally to the épicier, 
MERCHANT  IV, who has £200 for his commodities. It is clear at the 
outset that the CALICO continues to be available on the market as a 
commodity, even though it has passed from the hands of the 
MANUFACTURER  into those of the MERCHANT. It is the capital of the 
MANUFACTURER,  which has not yet passed through its first metamor­
phosis, has not yet been reconverted from commodity into money. 
For the MANUFACTURER this conversion has taken place. He has 
£1,000 instead of his CALICO. But for the  CALICO  itself the conversion 
has not taken place. It has not yet been converted into money, it 
has not yet passed over either into industrial or into individual 
consumption as a use value. MERCHANT I now represents on the 
market the same commodity capital as the MANUFACTURER originally 
represented. For the latter, the process of metamorphosis has been 
cut short by merchant I, but only to be taken up again, perforce, 
in the hands of the merchant. If the MANUFACTURER had had to wait 
until his CALICO really ceased to be a commodity, until it was 
converted into money, had passed through its first metamorphosis, 
had been sold to the actual buyer—the industrial or individual 
CONSUMER—his  process of reproduction would have been inter­
rupted. Or, in order not to interrupt it, he would have had to 
restrict his operations, expend a smaller part of his capital for 
yarn, etc., wage labour, etc., in short, for the elements of the 
production process, and retain a greater part of it in money as a 
reserve fund, so that, whilst a part of it was on the market as a 
commodity, another part could be converted afresh into produc­
tive capital, and then, whilst the second part entered the market as 
a commodity, the first part could return to him. This division is 
also necessary with trade. But, without the latter, the part of 
circulating capital held en reserve in the form of money would 
always have to be greater in proportion to the part involved in the 
process of production, and the scale of reproduction would 
therefore have to be restricted. Instead of that, the MANUFACTURER 
can now keep a larger part of his capital in the actual production 
process, a smaller part as money reserve. But instead of that a part 
of the capital of society—initially in the form of merchants' 
capital—is always to be found within the process of circulation; it 
never enters directly into the process of reproduction. It is always 
and exclusively employed in the purchase of commodities. There 
therefore appears to have taken place no more than  A CHANGE  in the 
persons who have in their hands this portion of capital. 
[XV-966] If the merchant were to employ the £1,000 produc­
tively  himself,  instead of using it to buy COTTON, there would be an

52 Capital and Profit 
increase in the size of the productive capital. But of course in that 
case the MANUFACTURER would have to keep a more significant part 
back as money reserve, and the same would be true of MERCHANT I, 
now turned into a MANUFACTURER. In the one case the productive 
part of the MANUFACTURERS capital would be increased; but in return 
for this the whole of the merchants' capital would be withdrawn 
from production. In the other case both of them would have to 
increase their money reserve, but then a large part of the 
merchants' capital would also be devoted to production. Thus it 
looks like six of one and half a dozen of the other; what is gained 
on one side is lost on the other. Nevertheless, it is not so (unless 
merchants' capital exceeds its necessary proportions). And indeed 
it is not so because the reproduction of merchants' capital and the 
reproduction of productive capital are two different processes, 
although the first is only a moment of the reproduction process of 
the total capital. In the best case, i.e. if he works to order and 
receives his money as soon as the commodity is finished, the 
COTTON MANUFACTURER can still only turn over his capital e.g. 4 times 
in the year, because he cannot produce and reproduce more than 
10,000 yards in 3 months. The repetition of his reproduction 
process is not only determined by the actual act of circulation— 
C—M—C—the circulation his commodity must pass through 
from the moment at which it emerges from the process as a 
finished commodity, in order to enter it once again in the form of 
the elements of the production of the commodity. It is determined 
further by the duration of the production process  itself.  If his 
capital were [£]900, and he always had to have 7s in the money 
reserve, there would never be more than £600 present in the 
production process, and he would only be able to produce 
6,000 yards in one rotation, hence if his capital turned over 
4 times he would produce 24,000 yards, whereas in the other 
case 47 he produces 40,000. When and how much he converts back 
into capital is by no means dependent on the character of his 
money as money; it is rather that this reconversion of money into 
productive capital, and the repetition of this reconversion, 
depends on the specific nature of his productive capital, on the 
use value of the commodity it produces, and the particular kind of 
labour which produces this use value and the conditions under 
which it is produced. 
If I now consider the £1,000 of MERCHANT I in relation to this 
single MANUFACTURER, the reproduction of his capital is in fact entirely 
dependent on the reproduction of this productive capital. He buys 
the 10,000 yards today, and sells them it doesn't matter when, say 

=====第63页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 53 
in a week.  He cannot convert  the  money used  in this way  back into 
yards until  the  MANUFACTURER'S second turnover time arrives,  at the 
end of the  first  6 months, when  the  latter again places 
10,000 yards  on the  market,  and so on. But  merchants' capital, 
after  the  10,000 yards  of COTTON MANUFACTURER  I have been sold,  can 
again  buy  10,000 yards there from COTTON MANUFACTURERS  II, III, IV. 
If we  assume  the  merchant needs  a month  to make  the  sale,  he 
could  buy  12,000 yards every month, hence  in the  course  of a  year 
12x12,000=144,000 yards;  and  thus with  his capital  of £1,000  he 
could  buy and  sell the  commodities  of 36  MANUFACTURERS, each  of 
them producing 40,000 yards  in the  year  and  having  a total capital 
of £32,400 (each  of them £900) fixed  in their TRADES.48 Admittedly, 
we are  assuming here that  the  merchant sells more quickly than 
the MANUFACTURER could.  If this were  not the  case, merchants' capital 
would represent absolutely nothing  but the  capital  of the 
MANUFACTURER lying idle.  And it  would  be the  same thing  as if the 
latter always  had  £1,000  in the  process  of production  and  £1,000 
as reserve  or as  means  of purchase available  in the  process  of 
circulation.  But  this more rapid sale,  i.e. the  more rapid finding  of 
buyers, results from  the  principle  of the division  of labour, since  the 
merchant  has  nothing else  to do but  find buyers  and  sellers.  The 
first moment  is therefore that  the  merchant  not  only enables  the 
MANUFACTURER  to convert  his commodity,  his calico, into money  at an 
earlier stage,  but  also enables this calico itself  to pass through  its 
first metamorphosis more rapidly,  to be  sold more rapidly. 
With this presupposition,  the  turnovers  of merchants' capital  by no 
means represent  the  turnovers  or the  repetition  of the  reproduc­
tion process—conversion  of the  commodity into money—of 
MANUFACTURER  I, of a  single capital  in a  particular sphere,  but  rather 
the turnovers of 36, perhaps, or  ANY OTHER AMOUNT,  of capitals 
functioning  in this sphere. 
[XV-967]  Or if the  merchant  is a  GENERAL MERCHANT,  he will  be 
able,  after  the  sale  of the  10,000 yards  of calico  for £1,000,  etc., to 
buy silk,  etc.,  with  the  result that  the  turnover  of his  capital  can 
represent  not  only  the  turnovers  of many capitals  in a  single 
sphere  of production,  but the  turnovers  of a  number  of capitals  in 
various spheres  of production. 
His money capital thus performs  the  same function towards  the 
productive capitals  to be  found  on the  market  in the  shape  of 
commodity capitals  as money performs towards  the  commodities 
whose prices  it realises  in sequence through  the  number  of its 
circuits  in a  given period.  Its turnover  is absolutely nothing  but 
the turnover  of money  as means  of purchase,  i.e.  means  of 
5-613

circulation, since in fact it merely represents C— M—C—M, etc. 
After the merchant has converted the commodity (of the 
MANUFACTURER) into money and therefore his own money into a 
commodity, he converts this money into a commodity again, etc. 
These turnovers of his money capital as means of purchase, as an 
intermediary in the circulation of commodities, depend on the 
total reproduction process, or at least on a substantial part of it 
(for the individual merchant), but they do not depend on the 
reproduction process of the individual capital. In so far as he, 
because of the process as a whole, always finds commodities on the 
market—and this is the prerequisite for him—his turnover consists 
in the mere repetition of purchases, a repetition mediated by the 
repetition of sales. His turnover merely represents the repetition 
of the circuit of money. The difference between his turnover and 
the simple circuit of money is this: the same piece of money repeats 
purchases. E.g. A buys from B with £10, B buys from C with the 
same £10, C from D and so on. Here the buyer is always a 
different person, although the £10 always remain the same. The 
money changes hands. But the MERCHANT who buys calico from the 
MANUFACTURER with £1,000 sells the same calico again to a third 
person, and the same amount of money returns to his hands. 
Whether it consists of the same coins is a purely accidental matter. 
It is at the same time M—C—M, the form of capital. But how 
often the merchant can renew the same operation depends on 
how often the same amount of money, his capital as money capital, 
returns to his hands. If we start from the merchant as commodity 
owner—and he has become a commodity owner by the purchase 
of the 10,000 yards—he sells the commodity, and he buys a new 
commodity with the money into which it has been converted. 
C—M—C.  The same money changes places twice: it comes into the 
hands of the merchant as seller and it leaves his hands as buyer. 
This is the movement of the metamorphosis of the commodity in 
general, a movement which the merchant represents in so far as 
he first sells (the commodity) and buys with the price of that 
commodity; first converts the commodity into money, then the 
money into a commodity. Here the money is mere means of 
circulation, although it represents capital for him. Nevertheless, 
this is not the peculiar movement of merchants' capital, although 
that movement does form a moment of its own movement; in so 
far as the movement includes a twofold movement of the same 
piece of money. But merchants' capital, as separated from 
productive capital, in so far as this itself circulates, always steps 
forth first as buyer, as money which is to be converted into a

commodity. It never makes its first appearance as a commodity, 
for the commodity appears in the hands of its first owner as 
product, and it never appears as such in the hands of the actual 
merchant. The real movement of merchants' capital is this: 
1) 2)3) 4)5) 6)7) 8)9) etc 
M— C — M — C — M ' 
Money is exchanged for a commodity, the same commodity is 
exchanged for money, the same money is exchanged for a 
commodity, the same commodity is exchanged for money, etc. 
The difference between this and the metamorphosis of the 
commodity, in which money only functions as means of circula­
tion, is this: There it is only the same piece of money which 
changes hands twice and is to be found in the same hand in a 
double determination (first as realised price of the commodity, 
second as means of purchase), while the two extremes, the two 
different commodities, only change their place once and then fall 
out of circulation. But here it is the same, the identical commodity 
which changes hands twice. It is sold twice, first by the producer 
to the merchant, and then by the merchant to the consumer, 
industrial or individual. There the twofold change of place of the 
same pieces of money is the mediation of the real exchange of 
commodities, the real exchange of matter. Here, in contrast, the 
twofold change of place of the same commodity is not the means 
whereby the same amount of money (increased) returns to the 
hands of the same person. It is merely through this twofold 
change of place of the same commodity—it is the means of 
pulling back the money—that the money constantly returns here, 
so that its movement appears as a movement of capital, although it 
constantly functions in the process as means of circulation. 
[XV-968] The sale of the commodity—the same phase of its 
metamorphosis—is here passed through twice. 
1)2) 
This is true if we consider the first rotation M—C —  M. It is 
otherwise in the reproduction, the continuity, the repetition of this 
process, and the movement of merchants' capital is this constant 
repetition. 
M—C—M/M—C—M,  etc. 
In the first rotation the same commodity only changes its 
position twice, and the same sum of money comes back. (This 
return of the same sum of money—hence the same sum of value 
{capital, because every sum of value appears in its return as 
self-preserving and self-valorising and [as] value relating itself

56 Capital and Profit 
to itself)—is very different from the twofold functional displace­
ment of the same piece of money. The money performs the latter 
function in its determination as money and indeed as means of 
circulation. The return may, it is true, also be purely formal. For 
example, when the capitalist pays wages in money, and the worker 
buys the commodity from the capitalist with the same money. This 
means only that the same persons confront each other as seller 
and buyer, the same money can therefore serve both of them as 
means of purchase.) But the sum of money which has thus 
returned—it is capital with reference to the money laid out, with 
which the process began; but it is also the realised price of the 
commodity which has been sold, hence the first metamorphosis of 
this commodity—  the same identical pieces of money now in turn buy 
commodities, which are in turn sold, etc. Here, then, there is in 
addition to the twofold displacement of the commodity a twofold 
displacement of the same money, or its displacement as means of 
circulation. The RETURN of the money as capital, accomplished by the 
twofold displacement of the commodity or its sale twice (or more 
times) in succession. But the repetition of this process, and 
therefore the purchase of the commodity, is mediated by the 
twofold displacement of the money which has returned, or its 
function as means of circulation. The rapidity of turnover of 
merchants' capital is therefore dependent on 2 moments: 1) On 
the rapidity with which its money capital performs the circuit as 
means of circulation, or, and this is the same thing, repeats its 
purchases. Here the purchase is always repeated with the money 
which has returned. Its rapidity is therefore the same as the 
rapidity with which the money changes its place twice, passes from 
the buyer of the commodity to the merchant, and from the 
merchant to the seller of another commodity. Rapidity in the 
turnover of merchants' capital, and rapidity in the circuit of 
money are therefore identical here. This repetition naturally 
depends upon a constant flow of new commodities onto the 
market, hence a constant flow of reproduction. If the  self-
renewing merchants' capital is large, the reproduction of the 
commodity must be not only constant and rapid but also on a mass 
scale. [The rapidity of turnover of merchants' capital however also 
depends] 2) on the rapidity with which the same commodity 
changes hands twice, hence on the rapidity of circulation of the 
same commodity. It must pass quickly from the hands of the 
producer into those of the merchant. But this is already implied in 
moment 1). What is added here, essentially, is this, that it must 
pass quickly from the hands of the merchant into those of the 

=====第67页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 57 
final buyer. He must sell quickly. He now sells either to the 
industrial consumer //we are leaving out of consideration the 
division of labour amongst the merchants themselves, by which 
WHOLESALE DEALER sells to RETAILER, etc.// or to the individual 
consumer. If to the former, this rapidity of re-sale will depend 
directly on the rapidity of reproduction. If to the individual 
consumer, consumption will form in reality a moment of the 
process of reproduction. It is C— M—C'in the first sense, that in 
which the commodity is converted into means of consumption 
through the mediation of money. The more production as a whole 
rests on circulation, each producer therefore possessing his 
product only in the shape of a commodity or of money, his 
consumption therefore resting on sale (qua ad commodity) and 
purchase (qua ad money), the more is the rapidity of consumption, 
of the commodity's withdrawal from circulation, conditioned by 
the manner of the production process  itself. 
The rapidity of turnover of merchants* capital therefore 
depends on 2 moments: the rapidity with which the same money 
changes its position, performs its circuit, hence the rapidity of 
money as means of circulation (is expressed in this). Then the 
rapidity with which the double displacement of the same commodity 
takes place, the peculiar circulation which is appropriate to it as 
commodity capital (not as mere commodity). Both moments depend 
on the rapidity of the total reproduction process. The turnover of 
merchants' capital is not, however, identical with the turnover or 
the number of reproductions of a productive capital of equal 
magnitude. It represents rather the sum total of the turnovers of a 
number of such capitals, whether in the same sphere or in 
different spheres of production. 
[XV-969] The more quickly merchants' capital turns over, the 
smaller it is in relation to the amount of productive capital. The 
more slowly it turns over, the greater is the part of the total 
money capital which figures as merchants' capital. Hence in modes 
of production, or at stages of production, at which circulation is 
undeveloped, because in general the exchange-value character and 
further the capitalist character of production is undeveloped, the 
total amount of merchants' capital (although small absolutely) is 
relatively large in proportion to the total amount of commodities 
thrown into circulation. The greater part of the actual money 
capital is therefore in the hands of the merchants, whose wealth 
thus forms monetary wealth as far as the others are concerned.

with this later.)

It further follows from the calculations: 
In so far as merchants' capital appears as commodity capital, it is 
absolutely nothing but productive capital  itself,  which happens to 
be in the sphere of circulation sub  specie*  commodity capital. It is 
true that it now appears in the hands of another commodity 
owner. But the fact that it is in reality just a phase of productive 
capital emerges immediately when the commodity capital in the 
hands of the merchant is unsaleable, when his money capital is 
therefore not returned to him, when he therefore cannot buy the 
commodity afresh. Then the same standstill in reproduction 
occurs as if the capital—in the form of commodity capital, in the 
first stage of its circulation process—were to be found unsaleable 
in the hands of the producer. 
It is not necessarily the case that merchants' capital performs 
just the turnover considered above. The merchant may perform 
both movements simultaneously. Then his capital is divided into two 
parts.  One consists of commodity capital, the other of money 
capital. From one he buys, thereby converting his capital into 
commodities. To the other he sells, thereby converting another 
part of his capital into money. On the one hand his capital flows 
back to him as money capital, while on the other hand his money 
capital is simultaneously converted into commodity capital or flows 
back to him as commodity capital. The larger the part which exists 
in one form, the smaller the part which exists in the other. But 
this division must balance out. E.g. £300 merchants' capital. He 
initially keeps £100 in reserve and buys commodities with £200. 
As long as this £200 exists in the commodity form he cannot buy 
with it. Now he buys with £100. At this point, however, £200 has 
been converted from commodities into money and £100 from 
money into commodities. But what is important here is that the 
merchant simultaneously buys with one part of his capital and sells 
with the other part. Assume he buys at 3 weeks' payment and he 
sells similarly at 3 weeks' payment. At the end of 3 weeks he owes 
£200 and is due to receive £100. He has thus a balance of £100 to 
pay, while he simultaneously possesses £200 in commodities. 
Instead of £300 he would then require only £100 to conduct the 
transaction. But if he has sold the commodities over the 3 weeks, 
he can pay the balance with the money he has made, and 
therefore does not need to lay out any money at all.

has bought without 
money, sold for 
money. Hence instead 
of £100 to add he has 
£100 in his possession. 
With the addition of money as means of payment, and the 
credit system founded on this, there is a further reduction in the 
quantity of money capital which forms mercantile capital, in 
proportion to the magnitude of the transactions this mercantile 
capital performs. If I buy £1,000 worth of commodities at 
3 months' payment, and I sell the commodities before the end of 
3 months, I do not need to advance a single farthing for this 
transaction. [XV-970] In this case it is also as clear as day that the 
money capital, which appears here as mercantile capital, is absolutely 
nothing other than productive capital itself in its form of money 
capital, its RETURN to itself in the form of money. (That the 
MANUFACTURER who sells the £1,000 of commodities for 3 months 
can discount the bill on the MERCHANT changes nothing in the 
situation, and has nothing to do with merchants' capital as such.) 
If the market prices of the commodities were to fall in the 
meantime, e.g. by Vio, the merchant would only receive £900 back 
IN RETURN, and would have to add £100 in order to pay. This £100 
would therefore be merely a reserve to compensate for a possible 
difference in price. But the same thing is true for the MANUFACTURER.

If he had himself sold at falling market prices, £900 would have 
come back instead of £1,000, and he could not have started the 
operation again on the same scale without a reserve capital of 
£ioo. 
Let us now consider another phase of the above process. 
The MANUFACTURER received £1,000 from the merchant to whom 
he sold his CALICO. With the £1,000 he buys yarn from the yarn 
dealer; MERCHANT II. His (the MANUFACTURERS) capital has thereby 
completed its circulation process and is once again in the sphere of 
production. The £1,000 in the hands of the yarn dealer represent 
on the one hand the RETURN of his money capital, the reconversion 
of his money into money. But with reference to the yarn  itself, 
hence productive capital, the £1,000 represent in fact its first 
metamorphosis, its conversion into money (although this has 
already happened for the yarn MANUFACTURER specifically through 
his sale to MERCHANT II). The phases of production of the capitals in 
the various spheres are intertwined with each other, in that what 
emerges from one phase as product (finished commodity) enters 
the other as condition of production, and indeed they may 
interlock with each other reciprocally in the way that iron enters 
the production of coal and coal the production of iron. The 
spheres of circulation are intertwined with each other in exactly 
the same way. Thus here the reconversion of the money capital of 
the CALICO MANUFACTURER into productive capital is the reconversion 
of the yarn into money, the RETURN of the money capital of the YARN 
MANUFACTURER. This represents at the same time the RETURN of the 
money capital of the YARN dealer. The money with which the CALICO 
MANUFACTURER pays the yarn dealer is not the money of MERCHANT I, 
for the latter has obtained commodities to the amount of £1,000 
for this. It is his own capital in the form of money. These £1,000 
now appear in the hands of the yarn dealer as  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL, 
but to what extent are they this, as distinct from this money as the 
money form the CALICO has shed, and the money form the YARN has 
assumed? If, for example, the  YARN  dealer bought on credit, and 
sold before he had to pay, the £1,000 would contain not a 
farthing of MERCANTILE capital as distinct from the money form, 
which productive capital itself assumes in its process of circulation. 
MERCANTILE capital, in so far as it is not a mere form of productive 
capital, which appears as a particular kind of capital because 
productive capital is to be found on the market in the hands of 
MERCHANTS in its shape as commodity capital and its shape as money 
capital, is therefore nothing but the part of money capital which 
belongs to the MERCHANT  himself.  This part represents—on a much 

=====第71页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 61 
lessened scale (if this were not so, mercantile capital would be GOOD 
FOR NOTHING), on a highly reduced scale—nothing but the part of 
productive capital which must always be available in the hands of 
the MANUFACTURER as a reserve for means of purchase, as money; IN 
FACT it represents nothing but a part of the part of productive 
capital which must always circulate as money capital. (It also 
circulates when held in reserve as means of circulation, as means 
of purchase. But it would really circulate. E.g. the MANUFACTURER has 
[£] 1,000 in commodities instead of £1,000. He cannot begin his 
process of reproduction with these commodities. He would need 
in addition £1,000 in money in order to buy means of production, 
etc.) This part is now to be found much reduced in size in the hands 
of a particular SET of capitalists, and it is always in circulation, 
always functioning in the circulation process. (To say that the 
merchant extends the market, that there is consequent division of 
labour, etc., amounts to saying that he finds buyers more quickly. 
For even finding more [XV-971] buyers only means finding 
buyers for more commodities.) It is very much reduced because it 
serves the turnover not of one capital but of many capitals. Apart 
from the part of productive capital which must constantly exist as 
money for current expenditure, another part must constantly 
circulate as means of purchase on the market, without ever itself 
being converted into productive capital, for the whole of the 
capitalist class, for the process of reproduction of the total 
capital—for the continuity of this process. This part forms 
mercantile capital. It is the smaller, relatively speaking, the more 
rapid the total process of reproduction, hence the circuit of 
money, and the more developed money is as means of payment, 
hence the credit system. 
We saw when we considered the total process of reproduction49 
that in part capital is exchanged with capital, in part capital with 
income and capital, and, finally, in part capital with income. With 
MERCANTILE capital this is represented in the following way, that to 
the extent that it exchanges with industrial consumers (disregarding 
here movements from the hands of one buyer into those of another, 
from the  WHOLESALERS  hands into the RETAILERS, etc.) it is a mere TRANSFER 
of capital; to the extent that it exchanges with individual consumers 
it is exchange with income. 
Mercantile capital is nothing but capital which functions within 
the sphere of circulation. The circulation process is a phase of the 
total process of reproduction. But no value is produced in the 
circulation process, hence no surplus value is produced either. 
There occur only changes of form in a magnitude of value which 

=====第72页=====
62 Capital and Profit 
remains the same. In fact what occurs is nothing but the 
metamorphosis of the commodity, which has nothing to do with 
value creation or value alteration as such. If surplus value is 
realised in the sale of the commodity, this is because the surplus 
value already exists in it; hence in the second act, the exchange 
back of the money capital in return for the commodity, no surplus 
value is realised (this can only be achieved here through the 
exchange of money for labour). On the contrary. In so far as this 
metamorphosis costs circulation time—a time during which capital 
does not produce—hence does not produce surplus value 
either—it is a limitation on the creation of value, and the surplus 
value will be expressed as a rate of profit in an exactly inverse 
ratio to the duration of circulation time. Mercantile capital 
therefore creates neither value nor surplus value. That is to say, 
not directly. In so far as it contributes to the curtailment of 
circulation time, and in general mediates the metamorphosis 
without which capital cannot begin its process of production anew, 
it performs a function indispensable to the capitalist mode of 
production, and it may indirectly help to increase the surplus value 
created by productive capital, or at least establish it as a higher rate of 
profit, or both at once. In so far as it helps to extend the market 
and mediates the division of labour between the capitals—hence 
also enables the individual capital to work on a larger scale—its 
function promotes the productivity of productive capital and the 
process of accumulation, the reconversion of profit into productive 
capital. In so far as it curtails circulation time, it raises the ratio of 
surplus value to the capital advanced, hence the rate of profit. 
Finally, in so far as it inserts a smaller part of capital (money 
capital) into the sphere of circulation of the commodities, into the 
process of circulation of capital (to the extent that this circulation 
process excludes the exchange of capital and labour capacity), it 
increases the part of capital directly invested in production. But as 
we have said: in so far as it has an impact on the magnitude of 
value as such, and the ratio of surplus value to the value 
advanced, it does this only indirectly, through its impact on the 
productive capital. Within the sphere of circulation—the only 
sphere in which it functions—it does not itself create value or 
surplus value, apart from that which flows from the sphere of 
direct production into the sphere of circulation. The profit which 
mercantile capital brings in is therefore merely a part of the surplus 
value, which is created by the total productive capital, and of 
which an aliquot part is transferred to mercantile capital. What 
mercantile capital is exchanged for—whether it is capital, or 

=====第73页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital 63 
money representing income, profit (interest), rent, wages—is a 
fixed amount of value, which remains what it was through this 
exchange. Mercantile capital not only does not itself produce its 
profit, which is, rather, [XV-972] only a TRANSFER from the surplus 
value made, squeezed out, by productive capital; it is also 
preserved as capital only through the constant renewal of the 
process of production. But the latter point is already implied by 
the fact that  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL  is in reality nothing but productive 
capital in its sphere of circulation; and it only appears alongside 
productive capital as distinguishable and distinct MERCANTILE capital 
because the part of PRODUCTIVE capital which would always have to 
be present in the hands of the INDUSTRIAL capitalist as circulating 
money capital is now to be found, on a much reduced scale, in the 
hands of a particular SET  OF CAPITALISTS,  whose function lies outside 
the actual process of production. 
Indeed, mercantile capital does not function in the actual process 
of production, but in the process of reproduction of the 
commodity, of which the process of circulation forms a section of 
its own. Just as the industrial capitalist is an agent of capitalist 
production, or productive capital personified, so the  MERCHANT  is an 
AGENT  of capitalist circulation,  IN FACT  a personification of circulating 
capital. But every capital which is engaged in the process of 
production or reproduction, which performs any necessary func­
tion of capital at all, draws, pro rata its size, an equal portion of 
the surplus value produced by the total capital within a definite 
period, hence e.g. annually. This is therefore true of mercantile 
capital as well, although it has nothing to do with the direct 
production of that surplus value, hence also nothing to do with 
the direct exploitation of the worker. (In so far as the RETAILER, etc., 
exploits the worker, he exploits him as a seller exploits the buyer. 
This cheating, this fraud, which we are not examining here at all, 
is not a form characteristic of capitalist production as such.) Just as 
a capital of 1,000 brings the same AVERAGE PROFIT as another capital 
of 1,000,  even though it only employs perhaps  Vs of the workers, and 
returns perhaps only once whereas the other capital returns 
4 times a year, hence has a longer circulation time, and 
employs less variable capital, so also with  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL.  What is 
involved here is only the size of the capital outlay, and the 
functioning of that capital IN WHATEVER  WAY  DURING  A CERTAIN PERIOD,  SAY 
[an]  ANNUAL  PERIOD.  Since the actual productivity of capital as capital 
consists in its producing profit; and since mercantile capital 
produces the same AVERAGE PROFIT as industrial capital 
(interest+commercial profit=interest+industrial profit), mercantile 

=====第74页=====
64 Capital and Profit 
capital does not appear as a particular kind of capital alongside 
productive capital, but as a particular kind of productive capital, as 
one of the particular spheres into which it is divided and within 
which it functions. We therefore find the following put forward 
side by side as kinds of productive capital: APPROPRIATIVE INDUSTRY, 
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, CARRYING INDUSTRY, MERCAN­
TILE  INDUSTRY. As if it were only distinguished materially from the 
other spheres of productive capital, whether through the particu­
lar kind of use value it produces (as with the MINING and 
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY), or through the particular way in which the 
use value is further shaped (as with the MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY and 
the CARRYING INDUSTRY). But mercantile capital is not a particular 
sphere of productive capital; it is a sphere of capital separated off 
from the spheres of productive capital. It has nothing to do with 
use value as such, being only concerned with the exchange of the 
use values, just as it has nothing to do with exchange value, but is 
only concerned with changes in its form. Mercantile capital should 
rather be placed in the same sphere as  MONETARY  CAPITAL.  Trade in 
commodities and trade in money as two particular spheres or 
functions of parts of the total capital which belong to the process 
of circulation. The great political economists, like Smith, Ricardo, 
etc., are embarrassed by  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL  as a separate kind of 
capital, since they rightly examine the fundamental form of 
capital, productive capital, and IN FACT only examine circulating 
capital in so far as it is itself a phase of the reproduction process 
of capital. Propositions about profit, etc., derived directly from the 
examination of productive capital, cannot be applied directly to 
mercantile capital. They therefore in fact leave the latter aside 
entirely, mentioning it only en passant as a kind of productive 
capital. Where they deal specifically with it, as Ricardo e.g. in 
connection with foreign trade, they endeavour to demonstrate 
[XV-973] that it creates no value, hinc"  NO SURPLUS  VALUE.  But what is 
valid for foreign trade is also valid for internal trade. The mere 
[act] of exchanging commodities, buying and selling, presupposes 
the commodities as use values which have a certain price, and 
creates neither the one nor the other. 51 
On the other hand, since mercantile capital is the first free mode 
of existence of capital in history, and appears as such vis-à-vis 
guild and feudal, petty-bourgeois and small peasant production, 
a Hence.— Ed.

the [advocates  of the ]  Monetary  and  Mercantile System regarded 
it as the  fundamental form  of  capital,  and  they derived from  it 
their notions of  SURPLUS  VALUE  and  PROFIT. PROFIT  UPON  EXPROPRIATION.17  In 
reality  the  merchant draws  his  profit from circulation  and  makes  it 
in the act of  circulation.  But he  withdraws what  is already there; 
he merely appropriates  a part  of the  surplus value which  is 
already contained  in the  commodity,  and  thereby shares  it with  his 
BROTHER  CAPITALISTS.  Because it arises from circulation for him, it 
appears  to arise from circulation  in and for  itself. 
If MERCANTILE CAPITAL  brings in A  HIGHER AVERAGE PERCENTAGE  OF PROFIT 
than industrial capital,  a part  of the  industrial capital  is converted 
into mercantile. If it brings in  A LOWER  AVERAGE  PERCENTAGE  OF PROFIT,  the 
reverse process takes place.  A part  of MERCANTILE CAPITAL  is converted 
into  INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL.  There  is no  capital which  can  change  its 
determination,  the  sphere  of its  functions, with greater ease. 
This is now the question: How does  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL  appropriate 
the rate  of surplus value  or profit which  is owing  to it? It  appears 
on the surface that it adds the  AVERAGE  RATE  OF PROFIT  to the price of 
the commodity.  We  have seen52 that  the  price  of production  of the 
individual commodity  or for the  whole capital  of every particular 
sphere  of production  is different from  the  value  of the  commodi­
ty, may  be equal, larger,  or smaller.  But the  sum  of the  production 
prices  of the  commodities=the  sum of  their values.  So if the 
AVERAGE  price  at  which every industrial capitalist sells  to the 
MERcHANT=the production price  of his  commodity,  the sum of the 
commodity prices paid  by  mercantile capital=the  sum of the 
values.  And  taking mercantile capital  as a  whole,  the  value  of the 
commodities would form  the  cost price  or  BUYING  PRICE.  And  since 
the merchant's profit=the difference between  BUYING  PRICE  and 
SELLING PRICE,  he  would sell  all  commodities above their value.  For 
every individual commodity the  PRODUCING  PRICE  would be his  COST 
PRICE,  and he would sell it above its  PRODUCING PRICE.  For all 
commodities together this would  be identical with  his  selling them 
above their value.  His  profit—taking  the  whole—would therefore 
come from buying  the  commodities  at their value  and  selling them 
above their value. Through this operation,  a part  of the  surplus 
value  (or of  profit),  or a  part  of the  commodity within which  the 
surplus value  is represented, would stick  to his  fingers.  If, for 
example,  I buy a  yard  at 2s. and  sell it at 2s.  22/5d., that  is the 
same  as if I  were  to sell only  10/n of a  yard  for  2s. and  appropriate 
for myself either  Vu of a  yard  or its  price,= 2/10s.  I achieve this, 
however, only because  the  buyer pays  as much  for one  yard  as 
I + V5 (l+2/io) of a yard cost. This is A  CIRCUITOUS  WAY OF  PARTAKING  IN

THE SURPLUS VALUE. Or, alternatively, the production price at which 
industrial capital sells is not=to the real production price of the 
commodity, but=its production price—the part of the profit which 
falls to the MERCHANT. In this case, the production price of the 
commodity=its cost price+the industrial profit (interest IN­
CLUDED)+THE MERCANTILE PROFIT. Just as INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL only realises 
in circulation profit which is already contained in the commodities 
as surplus value //although for the particular capital the quota of 
profit it realises is different from the quota of surplus value which 
this specific capital produces// so here mercantile capital would 
only realise a profit because the whole surplus value is not yet 
realised in the price of the commodity realised by  INDUSTRIAL  CAPITAL. 
Its SELLING PRICE stands above the BUYING PRICE, not [because it] stands 
above the value of the totality of commodities, but because in its 
BUYING price the value is realised,— [namely in] surplus value—the 
part which is due to the merchant.53

[XVI-973] THIRD CHAPTER 
CAPITAL AND PROFIT 
1) [SURPLUS VALUE AND PROFIT] 
Considered in its totality (wholeness) (or considered completely) 
(or in its completeness) the movement of capital is a unity of the 
process of production and the process of circulation. 
The surplus value produced within a given period of circulation 
(let us take e.g. a year as the measure; see above, Chapter  II54), 
when measured against the total capital which has been advanced, 
is called—profit. (Under profit is included not only interest— 
known to be a mere portion of the total profit—but also the rent 
of land,  which is nothing but a part of the capital employed in 
agriculture. The particular way capital is specified by this 
particular form of investment belongs to the consideration of 
landed property.55 Here we shall merely indicate that profit is not 
to be understood exclusively as what is called industrial or 
commercial profit.) 
Considered with respect to its material, profit is absolutely 
nothing but surplus value  itself.  Considered with respect to its 
absolute magnitude, it therefore does not differ from the surplus 
value produced by capital over a particular turnover time. It is 
surplus value  itself,  but calculated differently. By its nature, 
surplus value is related to that part of the advanced capital 
through exchange with which it arises, and it is therefore 
calculated in relation to that part. Circulation time, in so far as it 
differs from production time, only comes into consideration here 
as a barrier to the creation of surplus value. But as profit, surplus 
value is related to, and therefore measured by, not a part of the 
capital advanced, but the whole amount of the capital advanced, 
without regard to the entirely different positions these different 
6-613 

=====第80页=====
70 Capital and Profit 
components occupy in the creation of surplus value and the 
production of the value of the commodity in general. 
So: Assume there is a capital equal to 600 thalers. The constant 
part of the capital consists of 5/6 of it, namely raw material and 
machinery; the variable part, laid out in wages, consists of the 
remaining l/6 . If the surplus value produced in a year amounts to 
60 thalers —hence the value of the whole product in a year is 
660 thalers —this surplus value of 60 thalers is called profit, as 
long as it is not considered with regard to the 100 thalers which 
are exchanged for 160 in the capitalist production process, not 
with regard to the sixth of the capital from which it arises, but 
with regard to the 6/6 of which the capital advanced consists, i.e. 
with regard to the total capital advanced of 600 thalers. Although 
the 60 thalers continue to have the same magnitude of value, 60 on 
100 makes 60 per cent while 60 on 600 only makes 10%. Surplus 
value therefore receives in profit—which always expresses a 
relation,* a proportion—a new expression, numerically different 
from its original shape. The same magnitude naturally alters its 
numerical expression, once it is calculated, instead of in its organic 
relation to part of a whole, in a relation to the whole of the whole. 
[XVI-974] The difference is not only numerical but also 
conceptual, essential. It is not only a matter of a different valuation, 
measurement or calculation. There is more to it. This difference 
in calculation, measurement, valuation is a necessity for capital, it 
expresses a new characteristic relation of capital, the creation of a 
new form, which is just as essential as the difference between the 
form of exchange value and that of money, perhaps. 
As we have seen, the relation between surplus value and the 
variable part of capital is an organic one. In fact it expresses the 
secret of the formation and growth, of the existence of capital as 
capital. This organic relation is extinguished in the relation 
between profit and capital. Surplus value obtains a form in which 
the secret of its origin is no longer hinted at with the slightest 
trace. Since all parts of capital equally appear as the basis of the 
newly created value, the capital-relation becomes a complete 
mystification. In surplus value as such, the relation of capital to 
the labour which capital appropriates is constantly expressed. In 
the relation of capital to profit, capital is related not to labour but 
to itself.  It is on the one hand a merely quantitative relation of an 
amount of value or an amount of money to  itself.  If I say for 
example that a capital of 100 thalers brings in a profit of 
* An appendix should be added to this. See Malthus, etc. 

=====第81页=====
Surplus Value and Profit 71 
10 thalers a year, I am merely comparing thalers with thalers. On 
the first occasion the PRINCIPAL, the CAPITAL, the main amount, 
appears as given, on the other occasion these 100 thalers become 
the main amount, the PRINCIPAL, the CAPITAL, precisely because they 
bring in an extra amount, and the main amount appears as the 
underlying cause, of which this extra amount is the effect. This is 
its natural fruit. (See Aristotle on usury, 51 and also the one passage 
in Sismondi58 where he says that wealth like labour bears fruit 
annually. When he adds to this "like labour and through labour" he 
is already going too far.) 
The difference between capital and its particular forms is 
therefore extinguished in this form, and this is therefore also true 
of capital's functions in which it appears even before capitalist 
production  itself.  Capital thereby becomes a thing, which existed 
just as much in antiquity as it exists today. 
"The capitalist expects an equal profit upon all the parts of the capital" 
(Malthus).a 
On the one hand this contains the correct point that profit is a 
form of surplus value, if the latter is related equally to all parts of 
the capital and therefore measured equally against the total 
amount of capital. But there is also the point that the capitalist 
knows nothing of the essence of capital, and surplus value exists in 
his consciousness only in the form of profit, a converted form of 
surplus value, which is completely abstracted from the relations 
under which it originates and by which it is conditioned. During 
the direct process of production, the nature of surplus value does, 
it is true, continuously enter the capitalist's consciousness, as 
indeed we have seen in considering surplus value, the greed for 
alien labour time, etc.59 But this is only a transitory moment. In 
fact the capitalist himself regards capital as a self-acting automa­
ton, which has the quality of increasing itself and bringing in a 
gain, not as a relation, but in its material existence. The social 
relations under which value takes on this quality, and the things in 
which it exists as its body (use value), appear as eternal natural 
relations, or rather, it is grasped at most that certain (artificial) 
conditions hinder this natural development and cannot allow it to 
unfold completely. 
The notion of capital as a self-acting automaton of this kind lies 
at the basis of e.g. Price's calculation of interest and compound 
interest, which completely turned the head even of William Pitt.60

(See Luther on the growth of interest.61) Hence also the kind of 
idiotic proclamations one finds on the part of the political 
economists. E.g. there must be profit, otherwise the capitalist 
would put his capital out at interest. He would have no reason to 
throw it into production instead of putting it out at interest 
[XVI-975] (thus capital would allegedly bring in interest even if no 
capital were thrown into production). Thus Turgot already says: If 
it brought in no profit, everyone would buy land with his capital. 
(See Turgot.62 Thus here a particular mode of employment of 
capital is regarded as being of itself profitable.) 
Surplus value, however, necessarily assumes the form of profit in 
the bourgeois mind—and this is not just a way of looking at 
things. The relation of surplus value as a relation of profit 
dominates bourgeois production, determines the distribution of 
the capitals in the different branches of production, is so to speak 
the triangulation point for free competition (the competition of 
capitals amongst each other, i.e. the real movement of capitals in 
which alone the laws of capital are realised. These laws are in fact 
nothing but the general relations of this movement, its result on 
the one hand, its tendency on the other.) 
The relations under which a quantity of value, money, 
commodities, the particular use values in which value re-enters 
production, becomes capital, i.e. the owner of this quantity of 
value becomes a capitalist, are, under capitalist production, within 
bourgeois society, so enmeshed with the existence of capitalists 
that for example Wakefield had to go to the Colonies to discover 
that these relations are not self-evident, and that without them 
value does not become capital and the owner of value does not 
become a capitalist. So self-evident, and so altogether incom­
prehensible, that this discovery of Wakefield's could in fact mark a 
kind of epoch in modern political economy.63 
The actual production process of capital is constantly bound up 
with its circulation process. Both are moments of the production 
process  itself,  as the production process for its part in turn 
appears as a moment of the circulation process. The two 
constantly overlap, interpenetrate, and thereby constantly falsify 
each other's characteristic distinguishing marks. But in the process 
of circulation surplus value on the one hand assumes new 
determinations, on the other hand capital passes through transfor­
mations, and finally it so to speak steps out of its organic life into 
foreign conditions of life, into relations in which not capital and 
labour but on the one hand capital and capital confront each 
other, and on the other hand the individuals as well again

Surplus Value and Profit 73 
confront each other in the relations of simple circulation, as 
commodity owners, buyers and sellers—circulation time and 
labour time thus cut across each other as this path is followed, and 
thus appear to determine surplus value equally. Now the original 
form in which capital and wage labour confront each other 
disappears as it were, and relations enter the picture which are 
apparently independent of this, surplus value itself no longer 
appears as a product of the appropriation of labour time, but as 
the excess of the selling price of commodities over their value, and 
as well, above all, as money. The result is the complete extinction 
of the memory of the original nature of surplus value, or 
alternatively this original nature never enters clearly into con­
sciousness at all, but appears at most as an equally valid moment 
alongside the moments which arise out of circulation independent­
ly of capital's original nature, hence as a moment of the movement 
which belongs to capital independently of its relation to labour. 
Indeed, these phenomena of circulation are themselves directly 
adduced by other political economists (such as Ramsay, Malthus, 
Senior, Torrens, etc.64) as proofs that capital in its material 
shape—regardless of the social relation of production which 
makes it capital—is an independent source of surplus value 
alongside labour and independently of labour. But it lay in the 
nature of this relation, as we already saw in considering the 
process of production of capital,3 that the socially productive 
forces of labour appear as productive forces transposed into 
capital, that the autonomisation and personification of past labour 
and of the value which exists in practice in the shape of the 
capitalist, the rule of past labour over living labour, which 
constitutes the essence of capital, the transformation as against this 
of the worker into mere objective labour capacity, a commodity, 
the fruitfulness of capital, in so far as it exists objectively, does not 
appear as a consequence of the social relation of production, the 
latter appearing rather inversely as a consequence of the material 
relation between those objects and labour as particular moments 
[XVI-976] of the process of production. In the capital-relation — to 
the extent that it is still considered independently of its circulation 
process—what is essentially characteristic is the mystification, the 
upside-down world, the inversion of the subjective and the 
objective, as it already appears in money. Corresponding to the 
inverted relation, there necessarily arises, already in the actual 
production process  itself,  an inverted conception, a transposed

74 Capital  and Profit 
consciousness, which is completed by the transformations and 
modifications of the actual process of circulation. However, the 
capitalist as capitalist is nothing but this movement of capital  itself. 
What he is in reality, he is also in consciousness. Since the positive, 
dominant side of the relation is expressed in him, he only feels at 
home precisely in these contradictions; they do not disturb him, 
whereas the wage labourer, who is trapped in the same inverted 
notion, only from the other extreme, is driven in practice, as the 
oppressed side, to resistance against the whole relation, hence also 
against the notions, concepts and modes of thinking correspond­
ing to it. 
It must be added that in the real process of circulation not only 
do those transformations we have considered take place (and 
impel even the better political economists to adopt the capitalists' 
conceptions, if in a somewhat more doctrinaire form) but they 
coincide with real competition, buying and selling above and below 
value, hence profit does not appear to the capitalists as surplus 
value, as it is in fact for every one of them, not as dependent on 
the degree of exploitation of labour, but as the result of one 
person's taking advantage of another, a notion which not only the 
older, but even the more recent political economists have 
sanctioned. (E.g. Torrens.65 See also Senior on money, etc., and 
wages.66) 
In fact the only thing which interests capital in practice, and 
regulates the real movement of capital, competition, is profit, and 
not surplus value, i.e. the ratio of the surplus value to the total 
amount of capital advanced, and not the ratio of the surplus value 
to the capital laid out in the purchase of labour capacity. This 
leads us (and is the actual transition) to the consideration of  costs  of 
production and their relation to the  process  of the sale of the product. 
There are still a few remarks to make before we pass on to this. 
Firstly: From the standpoint of the society in which capitalist 
production prevails, capital appears as a  SELFACTOR—value  as 
possessing in itself the quality of self-increase in consequence of 
qualitates  occultae*  of some kind; how much this is the case appears 
strikingly in interest-bearing money capital, money capital loaned 
out at interest. An amount of value is sold here as in itself capital; 
i.e. capital itself appears as a commodity. A certain quantity of 
values, or a bill on values, is sold as a self-preserving and 
self-increasing amount. The situation is not altered by the fact that 
this amount is not money itself but the commodity into which it 
a Hidden  qualities.—  Ed. 

=====第85页=====
Surplus Value and Profit 75 
can be converted. For as self-preserving and self-increasing value 
commodities are viewed and sold merely qua exchange value, i.e. 
qua money. This quality of being capital is sold as an immanent 
quality of the amount of value. It therefore returns to its owner 
with a profit. 
Secondly: It needs no discussion here that if a commodity is sold 
above or below its value, there takes place merely a change in the 
distribution of surplus value between different capitalists, between 
the buyer and the seller. This difference in distribution, or 
alteration in the proportions in which different people share in 
the surplus value, does not change anything, either in its 
magnitude or in its nature. 
Thirdly: The relation of competition, in so far as we have 
considered it here as an illustration (not as belonging to the 
development itself67), entails that the surplus value the individual 
capitalist makes is not really the decisive factor. [XVI-977] For an 
average profit is formed; i.e. a general measure, and laws, 
according to which the capitalists calculate among themselves the 
total value of their class. (See Jones as well on this.3) The real .price 
of the commodity—disregarding fluctuations in the market 
price—is thereby considerably modified, and it differs from the 
value of the commodity. No individual capitalist can therefore say, 
nor does any one of them know, to what extent the surplus value 
he has produced himself enters, or does not enter, into the profit 
he makes, to what extent a part of the surplus value produced by 
the class of capitalists enters into the price of his commodity. It is 
best to bring this point in when considering the costs of 
production, just as it is best to bring in there the inverted manner 
in which the laws of capital are represented in competition. The 
perception, as it arises out of competition, the relation that 
dominates the capitalist (for it is in fact the laws of capital 
themselves which in competition appear to him as external 
compulsion applied by his capital to other capitals and to his 
capital by other capitals), alienates him completely from the 
perception of the inner essence of the relations within which he 
moves, and of which he is merely the interested agent or 
functionary. 
Fourthly: The confusion or lack of distinction between surplus 
value and profit is the source of the greatest BLUNDERS IN POLITICAL 
ECONOMY, even where it is merely a matter of giving a correct 
presentation. The significant political economists, such as e.g. 
a See this volume, pp. 366-70.— Ed. 

=====第86页=====
76 Capital and Profit 
Ricardo, naturally do not confuse the two completely, although 
they never consciously grasp the difference. But for that reason 
the real law appears with them, on the one hand, as an abstraction 
from the real movement, which therefore also contradicts it 
everywhere in detail. On the other hand, they are bound to want 
to use the nature of value or surplus value to explain phenomena 
which only arise from surplus value in the form of profit. Hence 
incorrect laws. Ricardo abstracts from competition where he 
develops the general nature of capital. On the other hand, he 
already brings in fixed capital, etc., as determining moments right 
at the beginning, in the determination of value, and thereby 
abolishes his so-called law or reduces it to a mere shadow, as 
Malthus correctly shows. 68 On the other hand, with his followers, 
like Mill and McCulloch,69 we see the insane attempt e.g. to 
convert circulation time into labour time, and finally to describe as 
labour not only the functions of beasts, but of inanimate things, all 
their natural motions. Say too in this connection.70 However this 
criticism belongs to the concluding section of this chapter.71 
2) [PROFIT ALWAYS EXPRESSES SURPLUS VALUE TOO SMALL] 
It follows from the characteristic distinction of form between 
surplus value and profit that profit always expresses a smaller 
proportion than that of real surplus value, hence the rate of profit 
always represents the ratio in which capital appropriates alien 
labour as much smaller than it really is. This (tautological) law, 
once understood, does away with all incorrect statistics, and it has 
bigger merits. It is essential for the comprehension of phenomena 
which would otherwise remain incomprehensible and limp along 
beside the theory as indigestible fragments of reality. 
It goes without saying that the magnitude a expresses a smaller 
ratio if it is measured against  b +  c+a than if it is measured against 
c+a, or that a magnitude expresses a larger or smaller part of a 
third magnitude according to whether that latter magnitude is 
itself larger or smaller. The total capital is therefore always larger 
than the part of it which is exchanged for wages. 
[XVI-978] 3) [THE RATIO IS ALTERED NUMERICALLY AND 
IN FORM] 
Profit is therefore a different relation firstly in its form; and 
secondly it is numerically different. It is a converted form of 

=====第87页=====
Relation of Surplus Value and Profit 77 
surplus value, in which there is a change firstly in the latter's 
numerical relation, secondly in its conceptual determination. 
4) [THE SAME SURPLUS VALUE MAY BE EXPRESSED 
IN VERY DIFFERENT RATES OF PROFIT; 
THE SAME RATE OF PROFIT MAY EXPRESS 
VERY DIFFERENT SURPLUS VALUES] 
Thus,  if the surplus value is converted into profit, i.e., 
considered numerically, if the surplus value is calculated in 
proportion to the total amount of capital advanced, the following 
propositions ore a further consequence of this different presenta­
tion: 
An equal profit may express different rates of surplus value. 
Take for example a profit of 10%. If the capital is 600, with 
constant capital 500 and variable 100, 60 thalers of surplus value 
amount to 60%, at the same time 10%, on a capital of 600. If the 
capital of 600 consists of 400 thalers of constant capital and 
200 thalers of variable, 60 on 200 thalers amounts to a surplus 
value of 30%. The profit continues to be 10%. Finally, if the 
capital of 600 consists of 550 constant and 50 thalers of variable 
capital, 60 on 50 would amount to 120% surplus value 
(50:60=100:120) but profit would continue to be 10%. 
5) [RELATION OF SURPLUS VALUE AND PROFIT=RELATION 
OF VARIABLE CAPITAL TO TOTAL CAPITAL]6 
Since profit is nothing but the ratio of the surplus value to the 
total amount of capital advanced, the rate of profit, or its 
proportional magnitude, evidently depends on two circumstances, 
firstly the total amount of capital advanced, and secondly the ratio 
of the variable part of the capital advanced to its constant part. 
This is when the surplus value is presupposed as given. Otherwise, 
it depends on 1) the ratio of the surplus value to the variable part 
of the capital; secondly the ratio of the variable part to the total 
quantity of capital, or also, and this is the same thing, its ratio to 
the constant part of the capital. E.g. 50 is V2 of 100, but it is, at 
the same time, -—-  = —  of 600. If 50 = S (surplus value), 100= V, 
the variable capital, then 5%oo is the rate of surplus value, 
which=72 or  50%  = %. If the total capital is 600=C(500)+ V, then 

=====第88页=====
78 Capital and Profit 
50/6oo=7i2=8 7s% is the profit, which =^—• y:jr~  =  (v+c):  v-
S S 
or also (the rate of profit)  : —  (is related to the rate of 
v + c V 
surplus value) = V (as the variable capital): V+ C (is related 
S S to the total capital). Thus -—:~=V:(V+C). 
Profit is related to surplus value as variable [should read: total] 
capital is related to total [should read: variable] capital (we do not 
need the categories of fixed and circulating capital here, because 
variable capital is circulating capital, but a part of constant capital 
is also circulating capital, so this antithesis does not belong here) 
and this evidently depends on the proportion in which constant 
and variable capital form components of the total capital [C], since 
V=C—c and c = C—v. If C were=0, variable capital would have 
reached its maximum; i.e. the whole amount of the capital 
advanced would be variable capital, i.e. capital laid out directly in 
s s 
wages. In this case profit would be =7-— = -. i.e. [XVI-979] it would 
be equal to the surplus value. This would be the expression of its 
maximum. It declines in the same measure as c grows, and 
therefore as the total amount of capital advanced, c + v, or C, 
diverges from the variable capital v. If one considers the 
expression ——. one sees that its magnitude evidently stands in a 
v + c 
direct ratio to the absolute magnitude of s, which is however 
,v 
conditioned by the ratio -; it stands in an inverse ratio to the 
t' 
magnitude of v + c, i.e. the total amount of capital advanced. With 
Cherbuliez (see Notebook72) the determination of profit would be 
correct, if he did not confuse product and value of the product, 
use value and exchange value of the commodity. 
6) COSTS OF PRODUCTION73 
a) We have seen74  that the general form of capital is  M—C— 
M'. In other words, money, an amount of value, is thrown into 
circulation in order to extract from it a larger amount. The 
process which produces this larger amount of value is capitalist 
production; the process which realises it is the circulation process 
of capital. 

=====第89页=====
Costs of Production 79 
The capitalist does not produce the commodity for its own sake, 
not for the sake of its use value or for consumption. The product 
capital is in reality concerned with is not the material product but 
the gain, the excess of the product's value over the value of the capital 
advanced, which enters into the production of the commodity. If 
he converts £1,000 into machinery, cotton and wages, this is not 
for the sake of the twist he produces but because the machinery, 
cotton and wages now represent £1,200, after their conversion 
into twist, instead of £1,000 as originally. The hoarder as such 
changes a commodity of a definite value, e.g. £1,000 of twist, from 
the form of a commodity into that of money, in order to withdraw 
the latter from circulation and to possess the exchange value of his 
commodity in the independent form of money, the form in which 
it is independent of the commodity  itself.  The capitalist does not 
share the hoarder's superstitions. The forms in which exchange 
value appears, commodity or money, are indifferent to him, they 
are impermanent forms, because all real wealth is for him in fact 
merely exchange value in its different embodiments. He first 
converts money into a commodity—a commodity of a higher 
exchange value than the money advanced, because within the 
capitalist process of production more labour time is materialised in 
the commodity than was originally contained in its factors of 
production, and indeed it is realised through the unpaid 
appropriation of alien labour time—and in the circulation process 
he converts this commodity back into money, but now into a larger 
amount of money than the amount from which the process took 
its departure. A part of this excess over its original magnitude 
serves him as income, which he consumes, and a part is converted 
back into capital in order to begin the same cycle afresh. Whether 
he converts it into variable or constant, fixed or circulating capital, 
the capitalist must, on the one hand, uniformly withdraw every 
part of the capital from his private consumption and consume it 
industrially, and, on the other hand, expose it to the chances and 
risks of circulation, once it has assumed the form of the product. 
The capitalist uniformly advances the total capital—without 
regard to the qualitative differences within it in the production of 
surplus value—in order not only to reproduce the capital 
advanced but to produce an excess of value over and above the 
capital. He can only exploit labour, i.e. convert the value of the 
variable capital he advances into a higher value, through the 
exchange with living labour, by advancing at the same time the 
conditions for the realisation, the conditions of production of this 
labour—raw material and machinery—converting a sum of value 

=====第90页=====
80 Capital and Profit 
he possesses into this form of the conditions of production, just as 
he is only a capitalist at all, can only undertake the process of 
exploitation of labour at all, because he, as proprietor of the 
conditions of production, confronts the worker, as the mere 
possessor of labour capacity. It is quite indifferent to him whether 
it is considered that he advances constant capital to make a profit 
on the variable capital, or advances variable capital [XVI-980] to 
make a profit out of the constant capital; whether he lays out 
money in wages to give a higher value to the machinery and raw 
material, or advances money in machinery and raw material to be 
able to exploit labour. Although the profit he makes, the surplus 
value of the commodity he realises in the process of circulation, 
consists only of the excess of unpaid labour appropriated by him 
over the labour he has paid—his commodity only has a surplus 
value because a portion of unpaid labour time is now contained in 
it, and he sells this although he has not paid for it—the size of his 
profit by no means depends on the surplus value alone, but rather 
on the ratio of the surplus value to the total amount of capital 
advanced. If the capital advanced was  1,000,  and if the value of 
the commodity into which it is converted is  1,200,  the profit is 
only 200 compared with  1,000;  200:1,000=20%. The part of the 
capital that was laid out in machinery and material of labour is 
just as much advanced by the capitalist as is the part laid out in 
wages, and although the latter part alone creates surplus value, it 
only creates it on condition that the other parts, i.e. the conditions 
of production for the labour, are advanced, and all these elements 
enter uniformly into the product. Since the capitalist can only 
exploit labour by advancing constant capital, since he can only 
valorise constant by advancing variable capital, all these things are 
lumped together in his notion of the matter, and all the more so 
because his real profit is determined by the ratio of surplus value 
not to variable capital but to the total capital, hence is not 
determined at all by surplus value, but rather by the profit, which, 
as we have just seen, may remain the same and yet express 
different rates of surplus value. 
We now return, therefore, to the point of departure from which 
we proceeded in considering the general form of capital. Profit 
represents the excess of exchange value, produced in the process 
of production and realised in the process of circulation, over the 
amount of money or exchange value originally converted into 
capital by the capitalist. Firstly, the real rate at which the capitalist 
profits, hence capital grows and accumulates, depends on this 
relation. Secondly, therefore, the competition between capitals is 

=====第91页=====
Costs of Production 81 
also dependent on this. Thirdly, this leads to the disappearance of 
any recollection of the real origin of this profit and the qualitative 
distinction between the various elements, or the entry of these 
elements into the capitalist process of production. 
Profit therefore=the excess of value of the product or rather 
the amount of money realised in circulation for the product 
(hence in the capitalist process, this excess during a particular 
turnover time) above the value of the capital which entered the 
formation of the product. The whole of the capital accordingly 
appears as means of production for this profit, and since these 
means of production are values which are here given over in part 
to the industrial process of production, in part to circulation, in 
order to create this excess of value or profit, the whole amount of 
the capital advanced appears as costs of production of the commodity, 
in fact costs of production of the gain or profit which is made by 
means of the commodity. 
Cost of production means everything, all the components of the 
product the capitalist has paid for. If he sells the commodity at 
£1,200, and surplus value on this amounts to 200, he has paid 
£1,000, he has bought it, and converted it from the form of 
money, of exchange value, in which he originally possessed it, into 
the form of the commodity; i.e., from the standpoint of exchange 
value, into a lower form. If he were not to sell the commodity, 
which he has not produced for its use value, the £1,000 advanced 
would be lost. They are in any case  costs,  and must be replaced by 
the sale, so that the capital can be available again and again in its 
original state, so that it may simply be preserved. [XVI-981] The 
£1,000, or rather the advance of the £1,000, for they are intended 
to be replaced, are the price—hence the costs—which the capitalist 
pays in order to buy the £1,200. 
It therefore follows that the production  costs  of the commodity from 
the standpoint of the individual capitalist, and its real production 
costs, are two different things. 
The production costs contained in the commodity itself are 
equal to the labour time it costs to produce it. Or its production 
costs are equal to its value. The labour materialised in it includes 
the labour used to produce the raw material which has entered 
into it, as well as the labour used to produce the fixed capital 
employed in producing it, and, finally, the labour, the neces­
sary and surplus labour, paid and unpaid labour, employed to 
produce it. 
From the standpoint of the capitalist, the costs of production 
consist only of the money he has advanced—or only of the part of 

=====第92页=====
82 Capital and Profit 
the production costs of the commodity which he has paid. The 
capitalist has not paid for the surplus labour contained in the 
commodity. Indeed, it is precisely the fact of not paying for this 
which constitutes his profit. This surplus labour costs the capital­
ist nothing, although it naturally costs the worker labour just as 
much as does his paid labour, and enters into the commodity 
as an element constitutive of value just as much as the paid 
labour. 
It follows, therefore, that surplus value, hence also profit, in so 
far as it is only another form of surplus value, does not enter into 
the production costs of the capitalist who sells the commodity, 
even though it does enter into the production costs of the 
commodity. His profit arises precisely from the fact that he has 
something to sell which he has not paid for. For him the profit consists 
in the excess of the value (the price) of the commodity over its 
production  costs,  which means in other words nothing but the excess 
of the total amount of labour time contained in the commodity 
over the labour time paid for by the capitalist which is contained 
therein. 
This solves the controversy over whether profit enters into the 
costs of production or not. (See in Say, Jones, and particularly 
Torrens, etc.; these matters will be examined in more detail later 
on.75) 
b) In a deeper sense, it is a question (see the absurd Say, Storch, 
etc. 76) of whether profit enters into the costs of production, i.e. is 
indispensable to capitalist production. It boils down to the fact that 
surplus value, hence also profit, is not merely a form of income 
but a relation of production for capital (for accumulation, etc.); 
the absurdity of the abstract distinction between a relation of 
production and a relation of distribution is in general demon­
strated here. The question can only be brought up at all through 
an absolute failure to comprehend the nature of capital, hence 
also of capitalist production. In the shape of interest, profit 
already enters as an element into the costs of production. 
c) It follows from the law that the production costs of capital are 
smaller than the value of the commodities produced by it (and 
profit is constituted precisely by the excess of the value of the 
commodity over the value of the production costs contained in it, or 
the excess of the labour contained in it over the paid labour 
contained in it), that commodities can be sold below their value at a 
profit. As long as some excess over the production costs is realised, 
a profit is always realised. The commodity will be sold at a profit 
as long as it is sold above the value of its production costs, 

=====第93页=====
Costs of Production 83 
although this does not mean that the buyer has to pay the whole 
of the difference between the value of the production costs and 
the value of the commodity. Assume that a pound of twist has a 
value of Is., of which 4/s are costs of production. Vs is unpaid 
labour, hence the element that constitutes the surplus value. If the 
1 lb. of twist is sold at only Is., it is sold at its value, and the profit 
realised in it amounts to  '/5S.  = 12/5p.  = 22/5d. If the 1 lb. were to be 
sold at  4/äS., or —— d.= 48/5d.=93/3d., it would be sold at 
V5 below its value, and no profit at all would be realised. But if it is 
sold above  9s/5d.,  say perhaps at 10d., [XVI-982] it is sold at a 
profit of 2/5d., although this is still 2d. or 2%od. below its value. 
The profit is there as soon as it is sold above its production costs; 
even if it is sold below its value. If it is sold at its value, the whole 
of the surplus value is realised for the capitalist, i.e. the whole 
excess of the unpaid labour contained in the commodity over the 
paid labour contained therein. Therefore delimited here is the 
whole of the room available for the rise and fall of profit. This 
room is determined by the surplus value, i.e. by [the correlation 
of] the value of the commodity and the value of its production 
costs,  by difference between the value of the commodity and the 
value of its production costs, between the total amount of labour 
contained in it and the paid labour contained in it. 
If the capitalist sells the commodity at a profit, but below its 
value, a part of the surplus value is appropriated by the buyer 
instead of the seller. This different division of the surplus value 
among different persons would naturally change nothing in its 
nature, just as it is a matter of complete indifference to the worker 
(unless he happens himself to be the buyer of the commodity) 
whether his unpaid surplus labour is appropriated by the capitalist 
who exploits him directly or by the class of capitalists, etc. 
This law, that the capitalist can sell the commodity at a profit, 
although below its value, is very important for the explanation of 
certain phenomena of competition. 
In particular, one of the main phenomena, which we shall come 
back to later in more detail, would be entirely inexplicable without 
this: namely, a general rate of profit, or the way in which the capitals 
work out amongst themselves the total surplus value produced by 
capital. A general rate of profit of this kind is only made possible 
by the fact that some commodities are sold above, others below, 
their value, or that the surplus value realised by the individual 
capital depends not on the surplus value it itself produces but on

84 Capital and Profit 
the average surplus value produced by the whole of the capitalist 
class. 
d)77 Therefore, if the surplus value is given, absolute or 
relative—i.e., on the one hand, there is a given limit to the normal 
working day, beyond which labour time cannot be extended, on 
the other hand the productive power of labour is given, so that 
the minimum of necessary labour time cannot be curtailed any 
further—profit can only be increased in so far as it is possible to 
reduce the value of the constant capital required for the 
production of the commodity. When constant capital enters into 
the production of a commodity, is required for its production, it is 
not its price (its exchange value) but its use value which alone 
comes into consideration. The amount of labour that flax e.g. can 
absorb in spinning does not depend on the value of the flax, but 
on its quantity, given the stage of production, i.e. given a definite 
stage of technological development; just as the assistance a 
machine affords to e.g. 100 workers does not depend on its value, 
price, but on its use value, its character as a machine. At one stage 
of technological development a bad machine may be expensive, 
while at a higher stage of technological development an excellent 
machine may be cheap. The English cotton industry was first able 
to develop once cotton was converted from an expensive into a 
cheap material by the invention of the COTTON  GIN (1793) //because 
1 old black woman could separate 50 lbs of cotton fibres from 
cotton seed in 1 day immediately after the invention of this 
chopping machine, whereas previously the day's labour of 1 black 
man was required to perform this process for a single pound of 
cotton//. 
The value of the constant capital required at a particular 
technological stage can only be reduced, hence the profit,  ——  can 
c + v 
only be increased, while the surplus value remains the same, in 
two circumstances. Either if there is a direct fall in the value of the 
fixed and circulating capital employed, i.e. both become the 
product of less labour time, hence there is an increase in the 
productive power of the branches of labour of which they are the 
direct products. In this case there is an increase in the profit in a 
branch of labour because of a growth in the productivity of labour 
(hence to a certain degree a growth in surplus labour) in the other 
branches of labour which supply it with the conditions of 
production. [XVI-983] In this case too, therefore, the profit 
thereby obtained (or the increase of profit, or, and this is the same 
thing, the diminution of the difference between profit and surplus

Costs of Production 85 
value),  or the greater productivity of capital (for profit is the 
actual product of capital) is a result of the growth in the 
productivity of labour and the appropriation of that growth by 
capital. Only this does not take place directly, i.e. it takes place 
indirectly. Thus the growth of the profit a capitalist obtains 
through the cheapening of cotton and the spinning machine, 
though not a result of the rise in the productivity of spinning, is 
indeed a result of the rise in the productivity of machine 
manufacture and flax cultivation (or cotton cultivation, etc.). 
The advantage of this is twofold, it raises the productivity of 
capital in two ways. In order to materialise a given quantity of 
labour, hence to appropriate a given quantity of surplus labour, a 
smaller outlay is needed in purchasing the conditions of labour, 
the constant part of capital, the value of which only reappears in 
the product but is' not increased in it. There is therefore a fall in 
the production costs now required to appropriate a given quantity 
of surplus labour. This is expressed by a rise in the ratio of the 
variable part of capital to the constant part, hence to the total 
capital. There is therefore an increase in profit, for clearly 
grows in line with a fall in the value of C, the numerical 
magnitude of C, since it would reach its maximum when C=0. 
Secondly: Let us assume that a constant capital of a given 
magnitude was previously required e.g. to employ a given number 
of spinners and to appropriate a given quantity of their surplus 
labour. At the given stage of production the employment of these 
100 men requires machinery2 of a certain quality and a definite 
size, and similarly a definite quantity of raw material, cotton, wool, 
silk, etc. But the value of this constant capital has nothing to do 
with the spinning process into which it enters. If it fell by a  half, 
the surplus value produced in the spinning process would firstly 
remain the same as before, but the profit would have increased. If 
the constant capital was originally 5/6 of the total capital, the 
variable capital l/6 — hence e.g. out of £600, £500 constant, £100 
variable — and the surplus value 30%, the rate of profit would 
come to 5% on £600 (100x6 makes 600; 6x5 = 30).(Rate of profit 
5%: surplus value  30%  = 600 (c + v):100(u)) (5x600=3,000, and 
30x100 similarly=3,000). The rate of profit was 5%. If now the 
production costs of the constant capital were to fall by half —  i.e. if 
there were a doubling of productive power in the branches which 
a In the manuscript, Marx wrote the words "fixed capital" over the word 
"machinery".— Ed.

86 Capital and Profit 
provided this constant capital — therefore from 500 to 250, the 
total amount of capital employed would have fallen from 600 to 
350.  The surplus value, at 30, and the variable capital, at 100, 
would remain the same... So now it is 30 on 350. The rate of 
profit, instead of , is —: ; so instead of 5% the 
v 500+100 250+100 
profit is 84/7%. (350:30= 100:84/7.) The profit would therefore have 
increased because in the first case the ratio of the variable capital 
to the total capital= 100:600= 1:6. In the second case it is 
100:350= l:7/2- In the first case the variable capital = '/6 of the total 
capital, in the second it= — = 2 /, . But the ratio is ^I(,?!-='I vï-XÏUl­
li 
The ratio of the variable capital to the total capital has therefore 
risen from V42 to 12A2, i.e. by 5/42- The rate of profit has increased 
by the same ratio as that by which the ratio of the variable capital 
to the total capital has increased, [XVI-984] because 7/42:I2/42 or 
7x4 7:12 = 5:84/7. (5x12=60, and 7x(8+4/7) = 56+ — -56+4=60.) 
This would therefore be the first gain, or, speaking generally, a 
capital of 350 would now bring in as much profit as a capital of 
600 did previously, because the surplus value would remain the 
same, but the employment of the same amount of capital laid out 
in wages would now only require for its realisation a constant 
capital of 250 instead of the 500 required previously. The 
production costs required for the production of the surplus value 
and accordingly of the profit would have been reduced. 
Secondly, however, £250 out of the total capital of £600 
required previously for the production of the same amount of 
commodities and the same surplus value would be set free. This 
money could either be invested in another branch of business 
for the appropriation of alien labour, or employed in the same 
branch of business. Presupposing the same stage of production 
and therefore the same ratio between the different parts of the 
capital, twice the number of workers could be employed, hence 
twice the surplus labour could be appropriated, without any 
increase at all in constant capital. An increase of only £100 would 
be needed for wages; hence a total capital of £700, to make a gain 
(a surplus value) of £60 (60:200, the same as 30:100, surplus value 
as before is 30%). Previously £1,200 would have been needed 
(according to the previous rate). Or if the 250 were added as new 
capital to the old (where this is technically possible) and divided 
into c and v in the same proportion, 7l3/7 would be the share of 

=====第97页=====
Costs of Production 87 
labour and 1784/7 the share of constant capital. According to the 
previous ratio, surplus value would then be 213/7 (or 30%) 
(100:30 =  73 3/7:21 3/7). The total profit on the capital of £600 
(although the rate of surplus value remains the same, surplus 
value itself has increased, because the ratio of variable capital to 
total capital has increased) now=30 + 213/7=513/7. 
The rate of profit would have increased from 5% to 84/7% as 
compared with the original situation, while the amount of profit 
would have increased, because surplus value has increased, from 
30 to 513/7. Every reduction in the value of the constant capital, 
leaving aside the fact that it increases the rate of profit, because it 
reduces the ratio of total capital to variable, now permits the 
exploitation of the same amount of labour with a smaller outlay of 
capital overall, therefore leaving the surplus value unaltered, and 
sets free a part of the capital, which can be converted now into 
variable capital, the self-increasing part of capital, instead of being 
converted into constant capital, as it was previously. Any increase 
in the value of constant capital (if the stage of production, hence 
the technological conditions of production, remain the same) only 
increases the production costs required for the production of the 
same surplus value, and therefore reduces the rate of profit. Any 
reduction in the value of constant capital, as long as the stage of 
production remains the same, increases the part of capital which 
can be converted into variable capital, capital which is not only 
self-preserving but self-increasing, and therefore increases not 
only the rate of profit, but its amount, because it increases the 
amount of surplus value. 
[XVI-985] Another example. 
If, therefore, there is a given capital, of e.g. £9,000 sterling, and 
if the same flax, machinery, etc., which cost £6,000 previously, 
and was worked on by 100 workers during the year, at 
£30 apiece, can now be bought at £3,000, the profit (surplus value 
calculated on the total capital) which accrued to the capitalist for 
the £6,000 would be as large as the profit for which 9,000 was 
previously necessary. He would need Vs less capital in order to 
absorb and appropriate the same surplus labour. £3,000 would 
therefore be set free for him. If the ratio remained the same, he 
could now, out of the £3,000 which had been set free, employ 
1,500 for machinery and flax, 1,500 for wages, and absorb the 
surplus labour of 50 more workers than previously with the same 
capital of £9,000. In the first case, the rate of profit would have 
risen if he only employed £6,000, because the ratio of the variable 
to the total capital would have increased. In the second case, the

88 Capital and Profit 
AMOUNT of profit would have risen as well as the rate, if he 
continued to employ the £9,000 in production, because 
1) 4,500 out of the 9,000 would have been exchanged for living 
labour, as against 3,000 previously, and because 2) the surplus 
labour of 50 more men would have been appropriated, the 
quantity of surplus labour would have increased not only relatively 
but absolutely. In both cases, the productivity of labour, in so far as 
it affects the constant capital, only increases the profit (the rate of 
profit) because it increases surplus labour relatively, in proportion 
to the capital laid out, or absolutely (the latter when a part of the 
capital which previously, on a given, on the same, scale of 
production, had to be converted into constant capital, now 
becomes free, or can be converted into variable capital). 
The increase in the rate of profit—through a reduction in the ratio 
between variable capital and constant capital [or in the ratio of 
variable capital  to]78  the total amount of capital advanced, or, and 
this is the same thing, through a reduction in the value of the 
constant capital, as a result of the increased productive power of 
the labour which produces it—originates in both cases solely from 
the fact that surplus value is increased relatively or absolutely in 
proportion to its production costs, i.e. to the total amount of 
capital required to produce it, or that the difference between 
profit and surplus value is lessened. This increase in the rate of 
profit therefore rests on the development of productive power, 
not in the branch of labour belonging to a particular capital, but 
in the branches of labour of which the product is the constant 
capital required in that branch of labour. 
//In reality the part of capital which exists as fixed capital—or 
also all the commodity capital which was produced under the old 
conditions of production —  is relatively devalued by this increase in 
productive power or the relative devaluation of this capital; just as 
the rate of profit is lessened, hence also profit is lessened 
proportionately to capital, whereas the value of that capital itself 
rises,  if there is a reduction in productive power, an increase, it 
may be, in the cost of iron, wood, cotton, etc., and other elements 
which [form] fixed capital and circulating capital, to the extent 
that they enter into constant capital, given that surplus value 
remains the same. This effect is to be considered in dealing with 
competition.67 This circumstance never comes into consideration 
with new capital investment, whether in the same business or in the 
newly established one; just as little with the raw material which has 
to be bought afresh.// 
// Furthermore, the rate of profit can be increased by curtailment 

=====第99页=====
Costs of Production 89 
of circulation time, hence by all inventions which ease COMMUNICATIONS 
and speed up the means of transport, and similarly by speeding 
up the formal transformation processes of the commodity, thus 
through the development of credit and the like. But this actually 
needs to be considered under the heading of the circulation 
process. // 
A second kind of increase in the rate of profit arises from 
another source, not from economy in the labour which produces 
constant capital, but from economy in the employment of constant 
capital. Constant capital is on the one hand saved by the 
concentration of workers, by cooperation, by labour on a large 
scale. The same factory buildings, heating, lighting, etc., cost less, 
relatively speaking, when employed on a large than when 
employed on a small scale of production. Here it is the common 
application of the same use value which lessens the costs of 
production. Similarly, the cost of a part [XVI-986] of the 
machinery, etc., e.g. a steam-boiler, does not rise in proportion to 
its horsepower. (See example.79) Although its absolute value rises, 
its relative value falls, in proportion to the scale of production and 
the magnitude of the variable capital which is set in motion, or the 
quantity of labour power which is exploited. The economy a 
capital applies in its own production, e.g. spinning, rests directly 
on economy of labour, i.e. the exchange of as little objectified labour 
as possible for as much living labour as possible, the production of 
the maximum amount of surplus labour, which is only made 
possible by increasing the productive power of labour. The 
economy just mentioned, in contrast, rests on accomplishing this 
greatest possible appropriation of alien unpaid labour in the most 
economical way possible, i.e., on the given scale, with the smallest 
possible production costs. This economy, too, rests either on 
exploiting the productivity of social labour outside this particular 
branch of production, i.e. the productivity of the labour employed 
in the production of constant capital; or, in the case considered 
above, on economy in the employment of constant capital, which 
either directly makes possible saving through cooperation, etc., the 
social form of labour within capitalist production, and the scale of 
this production, or makes possible the production of machinery, 
etc., on a scale at which its exchange value does not grow 
uniformly with its use value. In both cases, the raised productivity 
is the increase in the productivity of labour which arises from the 
social form of labour, this time not [through changes] in the 
labour itself but in the conditions under which and with which it 
produces. It is also relevant here that in large-scale production the 

=====第100页=====
90 Capital and Profit 
waste products more easily become the materials for new industry 
than does the scattered waste of small-scale industry; this likewise 
means a reduction in production costs. 
Capital therefore has a tendency in the direct employment of 
living labour to reduce it to necessary labour, and always to curtail 
the labour necessary for the manufacture of a product by 
exploiting the social productive power of labour, hence to 
economise on living labour—to employ as little labour as possible 
for the manufacture of a commodity. In the same way, it has a 
tendency to employ this labour which has been economised and 
reduced to necessary labour under the most economical conditions, 
i.e. to reduce the exchange value of the constant capital to the 
minimum possible level—hence altogether to reduce production 
costs to their minimum. If we see, therefore, that the value of the 
commodity is determined not by the labour time contained in it as 
such, but by the necessary labour time contained in it, capital 
realises this determination first, and at the same time continuously 
curtails the labour socially necessary to the production of a 
commodity. The price of the commodity is thereby reduced to its 
minimum, since all the elements of the labour required to produce 
it are reduced to a minimum. 
e) In order to calculate profit (like surplus value) we take not 
only the surplus value a particular capital produces in a given 
period of time (turnover time) but also a quantity of capital, 
e.g. 100, as a yardstick, so that the ratio is expressed in per 
cent. 
f) It is clear that the rate of accumulation, i.e. of the real growth 
of capital, is determined by the profit and not by the surplus 
value, since, as we have seen, the same profit and the same rate of 
profit may express very different rates of surplus value. It is profit 
that expresses surplus value in proportion to the total amount of 
capital advanced, hence the real growth (or the ratio of real 
growth) of the total capital. The real gain the capitalist makes is 
therefore not expressed by the surplus value but by the profit. 
Surplus value is related only to the part of the capital from which 
it directly arises. Profit is related to the whole of the capital which 
has been advanced in order to produce that surplus value; this 
capital therefore contains not only the part directly exchanged for 
living labour, but also the part representing the sum of the value 
of the conditions of production under which alone the other part 
of the capital, can be exchanged for living labour and the latter 
exploited. 
[XVI-987] Surplus value only expresses the excess of the part of 

=====第101页=====
Costs of Production 91 
living labour exchanged and appropriated in the production 
process over the equivalent given away in exchange for it in wages, 
in the form of objectified labour. Profit, however, expresses the 
excess of the value of the product over the value of  the whole of the  costs 
of production; hence it expresses in fact the increment of value 
which the total capital receives at the end of the processes of 
production and circulation, over and above the value it possessed 
before this process of production, when it entered into it. 
Profit is therefore also the sole form which interests capital 
directly, and in it the memory of its origin is completely 
extinguished. The conversion of surplus value into profit there­
fore completes the mystification which makes capital appear as a 
SELFACTOR and a person vis-à-vis labour, thus turning the objective 
moment of the production process into a subject. 
g) How, then, is profit related to the size of the capital, 
presupposing the same surplus value? This is the same question as: 
How is the amount of profit related to the rate of profit? 
But secondly, how does a general rate of profit originate, a rate of 
profit dependent on the size of the capital alone, and independent 
of the surplus value which is created by a particular capital in a 
particular branch of business, or of the productivity (i.e. the ratio 
of appropriation of alien labour) prevailing in a particular branch 
of business? 
These two questions, which are connected with production costs, 
must be answered before we proceed to the solution of the most 
important question in this section—the decline of the rate of 
profit in the course of capitalist production. 
//Before this, one further remark regarding 6  c). a80 Since 
commodities can be sold at a profit beneath their value—namely, 
provided that they are sold above the capitalist's costs, the part of 
the production costs paid for by the capitalist  himself,  the part 
advanced from his own purse—and since the difference between 
the value of the commodity and costs of production allows the 
capitalist considerable room for manoeuvre and makes it possible 
to set very different price levels for the commodity below its value 
without liquidating profit altogether—it is clear that competition 
could force down the rate of profit everywhere, not only in one 
branch, but in many, indeed in all branches of production, 
through a gradual compression of prices below their value. If 
society consisted purely of industrial capitalists, this would balance 
out, since each of them would obtain his conditions of labour 
a See this volume, pp. 82-84.— Ed. 

=====第102页=====
92 Capital and Profit 
cheaper not only as a private consumer but as an industrial 
consumer, the rate of profit therefore rising again generally as a 
result both of the devaluation of the total capital advanced and of 
the diminution in the production costs of labour capacity, hence 
the rise of surplus value relatively to variable capital. But society 
includes classes with fixed incomes, THE  MONEYED  CLASS,  etc., creditors 
and so on, hence there are fixed deductions from surplus value or 
profit which do not fall with the reduction in the rate of profit or 
the fall of the prices of commodities beneath their value. These 
classes would make a double gain. The rate which would fall to 
their share would have a higher exchange value, because it 
remained unchanged, while the prices of commodities would on 
the average have fallen beneath their value. They would come to a 
greater proportion of the deduction, and would be able to buy 
more with this. Something of the kind took place in England 
between 1815 and 1830 (see Blakesi). Under these circumstances, 
the situation of the actual industrial capitalists might be very 
precarious. The moneyed classes would in fact pocket the 
considerable part of the surplus value lost by industrial capital 
itself.  However, such a state of affairs could only be temporary, 
since it would call forth bankruptcies among the industrialists (as 
among the English farmers between 1815 and 1830) and hold up 
the accumulation of capital. A reaction would necessarily occur. 
Therefore, although competition may reduce the rate of profit not 
only in a particular branch of industry, as long as it is higher than 
the average rate, but also, [XVI-988] as Adam Smith says,82 in all 
branches, the latter effect can only be temporary. The capital 
accumulated in the hands of the nx[ed] INCOME and MONEYED CLASSES 
would either have to be employed in the purchase of commodities 
for consumption, and in this case the price of the commodity 
would again move closer to its value, hence the rate of profit 
would again rise; or it would itself be loaned out again as capital. 
In the latter case there would be on the one hand a yet further 
increase in competition, hence the rate of profit, which had 
already fallen a long way, would sink still further owing to a 
further reduction of the prices of the commodities beneath their 
values, thereby bringing about a crisis, an explosion and a 
reaction; but on the other hand, the new placements of funds, 
whether as interest or as rent, would be made at a lower rate, in 
line with the fall in prices, thereby bringing forth a situation 
approximating to that in which all capitalists sold the commodities 
beneath their value, hence, through equalisation, at their value. 
The rate of profit would thereby rise to its normal level again. 

=====第103页=====
Costs of Production 93 
From this standpoint, therefore, it appears that Adam Smith's 
view is correct in one aspect, overlooked by his opponents, that it 
explains certain temporary phenomena of modern industry, but 
does not explain the general phenomenon which is involved in the 
normal decline of the rate of profit; all it does is to explain merely 
temporary general fluctuations, which are later again balanced out. 
Further: This view does not in fact imply that the rate of profit 
in general sinks, but rather the rate of profit which appears 
directly as industrial profit. It implies that there merely takes place 
a different distribution, since in fact a considerable part of the 
surplus value is POCKETED by the MONEYED INTEREST and the FIXED INCOME 
MEN, instead of the industrial capitalists themselves. There is, it 
suggests, merely a different distribution of profit in general; profit 
itself has not changed its rate, since it now appears as higher 
income in the hands of other classes. In the long term, indeed, 
this would lead to crises and reaction. So Adam Smith does not 
explain the actual phenomenon. But the value of the  FIXED  INCOMES 
would rise, on the one hand because they would collect a higher 
rate of overall profit—although the rate would remain the same 
nominally—and secondly because they would in fact buy for their 
share not only more products, but also a greater amount of 
objectified labour, even if this labour was not paid for by them. // 
It is clear that if the surplus value is given, and the rate of profit 
in which it is expressed is given // this may, as we have seen, vary 
greatly while the surplus value remains the same//, the amount of 
profit, the absolute magnitude of profit, depends entirely on the 
magnitude of the total capital  employed.  If the profit on 100 thalers is 
10, it is 10,000 on 100,000, namely 10x1,000, since the ratio of 
capital 100 to capital 100,000= 10:(10x  1,000).  The amount of 
profit grows in this case in exactly the same measure as the value 
or the magnitude of the capital advanced; just as when the capital 
is given, the amount of profit depends on the rate of profit. 
1) We see, however, that the same surplus value may be 
expressed in very different rates of profit, according to the ratio 
of the variable capital to the total capital. 
2) But secondly, the surplus value itself is in the nature of 
things not the same for different capitals. It differs. In the first 
place, the ratio of the actual circulation time to production time 
varies, and therefore the turnover time of different capitals is 
different, and the surplus value really created stands in a ratio 
which is the inverse of that between circulation time and 
production time. Secondly, the normal working day differs with 
different capitals, and therefore surplus labour time is different, 

=====第104页=====
94 Capital and Profit 
although this is initially only to be conceived as compensation for 
the proportions in which the different modes of labour stand 
towards simple average labour. Thirdly, the ratio of circulating to 
fixed capital, the ratio in which fixed capital turns over, etc., are 
different. Productivity differs in different branches of industry, 
and the proportion in which they participate in the productivity of 
other branches of industry is also different. For example, an 
industry which employs very few hands does not participate in the 
cheapening of agricultural products, or, in general, in the 
cheapening of means of subsistence, in the same measure as an 
industry which employs many hands, one setting in motion much 
living labour; just as an industry which employs little machinery 
does not participate in the same measure in the cheapening of 
machinery as one which employs a great deal of machinery. 
[XVI-989] One can only speak of an average rate of profit when 
the rates of profit in the different branches of production of 
capital are different, not when they are the same. 
A closer investigation of this point belongs to the chapter on 
competition.67 Nevertheless, the decisive general considerations 
must be adduced here. 
Firstly, it lies in the nature of a common or general rate of 
profit that it represents the average profit; the average of very 
diverse rates of profit. 
The average rate of profit presupposes further that if a 
particular capital in a particular investment brings in a profit 
which rises or falls about a certain point, its profit rises or falls 
above or below the normal rate of profit, which is therefore 
determined precisely by the level designated from this point of 
measurement. At this level the rate of profit counts as the normal 
one, which capital as such is by and large entitled to. But even 
now we are not yet at the decisive point. 
A rate of profit—to the extent that it is not compensated for by 
the particular nature of the capital investment, in an analogous 
manner to the way concurrent circumstances, such as the 
particular nature of the labour, etc., modify somewhat the 
differences in length of the normal days of different branches of 
labour—above or below the average counts as an exceptional 
condition for capital in the particular branch of investment where 
it takes place, and it will be forced down or raised up by 
competition to the general level, through the entry of outside 
capitals into the privileged branch, or in the opposite case the exit 
of local capitals—capitals which are settled in that branch—out of 
the latter. The level of the rate of profit thereby falls in the first

Costs of Production 95 
case,  and rises in the second. The surplus profit, or the short-fall 
of profit, an individual capitalist encounters in a particular branch 
(district) of capital investment, does not belong to this discussion at 
all. What is involved here is rather the profit of capital in all the 
particular branches of production, or in every particular sphere of 
capital investment conditioned by the social division of labour— 
for every capital placed in average or normal conditions. This 
qualification is necessary, in order to proceed, through analysis, to 
what lies at the basis of the average rate of profit. 
If we adopt some particular quantity of capital, e.g. 100, as a 
yardstick—i.e. a yardstick for comparing the magnitude of 
different capitals—the meaning of the average rate of profit is that 
on £100 a profit of e.g. £10, of Vio of the capital advanced, or of 
10%,  is made, entirely disregarding the particular nature or 
determination of the sphere of production in which this £100 is 
invested as capital. It therefore by no means follows that a sum of 
value of £100 can be invested as capital in every sphere of 
production. It only follows that in each of these spheres 10% is 
made on 100, whatever the magnitude of the capital required for 
engaging in a particular branch of production. A general rate of 
profit therefore means in fact nothing but that the total amount of 
profit is absolutely determined by the magnitude of the capital 
advanced. The capital may be large or small, the average rate of 
its profit is 10%, and indeed in the same circulation time, turnover 
time,  hence 1 year for example, as the measure of circulation time. 
If circulation time is posited as indifferent for all capitals (or 
identical, which is the same thing); furthermore the rate of profit 
too; the amount of profit will depend entirely on the magnitude 
of the capital. Or, the amount of profit=a times x, in which a is a 
fixed magnitude, x is the variable which expresses the magnitude 
of the capital. Or, given the magnitude of the capital, the amount 
of profit is given, namely determined, by the general rate of 
profit. [XVI-990] That the general rate of profit=10%, e.g., 
means nothing at all except that Vio of the capitals, in whatever 
branch they are employed, returns as profit or that the profit 
stands in the same ratio to the magnitude of the capital—has the 
same ratio to the magnitude of the capital advanced, its amount 
therefore depends directly on the magnitude—stands in direct 
ratio to the magnitude of the capital; hence is similarly indepen­
dent of the real turnover time of the capital (since the rate of profit 
is the same for any given circulation time), is independent of its 
specific circulation time—i.e. of the ratio of its circulation time to its 
production time; is similarly independent of the organic relation

of the different components of capital in each particular branch 
of production, hence independent of the real surplus value— 
i.e. the real quantity of surplus labour—which every individual 
capital absorbs or produces in every particular branch of produc­
tion. 
The conversion of surplus value into profit alters not only the 
numerical relation—or rather the expression of the numerical 
relation—but the form as such. Surplus value appeared as a 
relation in which objectified labour was exchanged for living 
labour, or in which objectified labour appropriated living labour 
without exchange. The organic relation of the different parts of 
the capital advanced to each other, and therefore also the relation 
of the surplus value to a specific component of the capital 
emerges, is expressed in this. The relation ceases as soon as 
surplus value is expressed as profit. All parts of the capital 
advanced appear as uniform magnitudes of value, only differing 
quantitatively—amounts of exchange value, sums of value which 
in relation to their quantity—or rather added together— 
uniformly have the quality of producing not only themselves but 
an excess over their original magnitude: profit. The capital is the 
main sum, the profit is the subsidiary sum produced by this main 
sum in a definite circulation time. The main sum, the capital, is 
related as ground (cause) to the subsidiary sum as the grounded 
(consequence, effect). This appears as the existing law of capitalist 
production. How and whence and why is so little expressed in this 
relation of capital and profit that the spokesmen of capitalist 
production, the political economists, give the most varied and 
contradictory interpretations of this phenomenon. 
Nevertheless, even after this conversion of surplus value into 
profit, surplus value remains equal to profit as an absolute 
magnitude. Whether 100 is calculated as a profit of 10% on  1,000, 
or as a surplus value of 20% on the variable part contained within 
that 1,000,  say 500, the 100 continues [to appear] as the same 
magnitude of value, only differently calculated //and in the 
difference of the calculation there exists the difference of form, 
the extinction of the relation of this  excess  over the capital advanced 
to the organic relation of the different components of capital//. In itself 
the distinction remains purely formal. The difference of surplus 
value in particular capital investments would therefore continue to 
be displayed here as a difference of profit. 
The situation is entirely different, however, with the general rate 
of profit, the most general law of which is expressed in the fact that 
the rate of profit is equal for all capitals, or, and this is the same 

=====第107页=====
Costs of Production 97 
thing, that the amounts of profit are related to each other directly 
and exactly as the magnitudes of the capitals. 
The general rate of profit, and therefore profit in its real, 
empirical shape, already implies the conversion of surplus value 
into profit and therefore the conversion of the rate of surplus 
value into the rate of profit. But then the differences in surplus value 
(in its rate) (and therefore also relatively in the total amounts of 
surplus value), as they emerge in the particular spheres of capital 
investment, partly owing to differences in the ratio of variable to 
constant capital, partly owing to the ratio of circulating and fixed 
capital (let us say owing to all the relations which emerge from the 
ratio of production time to circulation fXVI-991] time)—these 
different rates of surplus value, or the diversity of surplus value, 
continue to exist, although in the altered form of differences in 
profit or different rates of profit. These serve as the substance, the 
prerequisite, of the general rate of profit, and therefore of profit in 
its organic form. They are equalised, reduced to their average 
magnitude, which is then the real (normal) rate of profit in all 
particular spheres—particular spheres of production of capital— 
produced by the division of social labour. On the basis of the first 
transformation, therefore, a second takes place, which no longer 
affects the form alone, but also the substance  itself,  in that it alters 
the absolute magnitude of profit—hence of surplus value, which 
appears in the form of profit. This absolute magnitude was 
untouched by the first transformation. 
Whatever the production costs (in the capitalist's eyes) in any 
particular sphere of production—hence of any particular com­
modity—the capitalist adds e.g. 10% (the general rate of profit) to 
the sum advanced, calculates thus that 10% will be added to the 
amount of commodities produced in a year. This 10% then enters 
into the price of the commodity, and if the commodity is sold at 
this price the normal profit, or the average profit, is realised. If, 
e.g., the capitalist were to reckon 2% over this average profit in 
the first half of the year, and 2% under in the second  half,  the 
total amount of commodities during a year, or the average profit 
he makes during a year, would represent the normal profit or 
average profit of a capital of a given magnitude, since the 
increases and reductions in profit during the daily transactions 
would have balanced out to that amount. 
But in its essence profit consists of surplus value—not of a 
formally higher valuation of the product, as perhaps the money 
price rises nominally if the value of the material of money, gold 
perhaps, falls, without a simultaneous fall in the value of 

=====第108页=====

commodities. Surplus value is a genuine creation of new value. It 
represents more objectified labour—hence a higher real exchange 
value—than the labour originally objectified in the capital, i.e. it 
goes beyond its original exchange value. And this surplus quantity 
of labour is realised in a surplus quantity of product or use value. 
Just as it would be wrong to regard a greater quantity of use 
values or products as a greater quantity of objectified labour on 
account of their greater quantity—with an increase in the 
productivity of labour they may represent the converse, a smaller 
quantity of labour—so it is correct that at a given level of the 
productivity of labour, at a given stage of production, surplus 
labour or surplus value expresses itself at the same time as surplus 
product, more use value. If we consider the total capital, the total 
surplus value represents the total excess quantity of labour which 
is realised in the total SURPLUS PRODUCE, over and above the product 
which replaces the constant part of capital and is required for the 
reproduction of the whole of the working class—a SURPLUS PRODUCE 
which is in part converted back into capital, and in part forms the 
income of all the classes living, under various headings, from their 
command over alien labour, from their respective shares in this 
SURPLUS PRODUCE. 
If the addition of profit to price were merely formal, it would 
be nominal, in the same way as if the value of the total product 
were only distinguished from the total value of the capital 
advanced by being valued, let us say, in money whose value had 
fallen, or, equally, whose numerical expression had been mag­
nified by being valued in silver instead of in gold. [XVI-992] 
Neither new value nor SURPLUS PRODUCE would be implied thereby. 
All capitalists would sell the same value at a higher money price, 
the same as if they were all to sell it at a lower money price or all 
to sell it at a money price corresponding to the value. It would 
then also be a matter of indifference whether a profit of 10% or 
1,000%  were added to the price of the costs of production, for the 
BIG FIGURES  which express a merely nominal increase of the price are 
just as irrelevant as if this nominal increase were to take place on a 
smaller scale. The percentages of this nominal increase would be a 
matter of complete indifference. The wage, i.e. the part of capital 
which is set aside for the reproduction of labour capacity, as well 
as the part of capital which replaces the constant capital advanced, 
would appear in the same ratio in BIGGER FIGURES, in a higher 
monetary expression. 
Just as the surplus value of the individual capital in each 
particular sphere of production is the measure of the absolute 

=====第109页=====
Costs of Production 99 
magnitude of the profit—in so far as this is merely a converted 
form of surplus value—so is the total surplus value produced by 
the total capital, hence the whole of the class of capitalists, the 
absolute measure of the total profit of the total capital, whereby profit 
should be understood to include all forms of surplus value, such 
as rent, interest, etc. (that this total profit implies an ENCROACHMENT 
on wages is beside the point, as was shown earlier2). It is therefore 
the absolute magnitude of value (and therefore the absolute SURPLUS 
PRODUCE, amount of commodities) which the capitalist class can 
divide up among its members under various headings. The 
empirical, or average, profit can therefore be nothing other than 
the distribution of that total profit (and the total surplus value 
represented by it or the representation of the total surplus labour) 
among the individual capitals in each particular sphere of 
production, in equal proportions, or, what is the same thing, 
according to the different proportions in which they stand to the 
magnitude of the capitals, and not according to the proportion in 
which the capitals directly stand to the production of that total 
profit. It therefore only represents the result of the particular 
mode of calculation in which the different capitals divide among 
themselves aliquot parts of the total profit. What is available for 
them to divide among themselves is only determined by the 
absolute quantity of the total profit or the total surplus value. The 
rule of distribution is equal profit for capitals of equal magnitude 
or inequality of profit in proportion to the unequal magnitude of 
the capitals. What was merely formal in the first transformation, 
the calculation of surplus value on the individual overall capital as 
a uniform, distinct amount of value without regard to the organic 
relation of its components, becomes here a material difference, 
since the share of total profit or total surplus value is uniformly 
determined, measured, at so many per 100, hence according to 
the magnitude of the capitals, without regard to the proportion in 
which each individual capital in each particular sphere of 
production participates in the creation of that total profit or total 
surplus value. Just as in the first transformation the surplus value 
is formally determined as the excess of the value of the product 
over the value of the capital advanced, so here the share of each 
capital advanced in the excess of the value of the total product of 
the total capital over its total value is determined materially in 
proportion to the value of the capital advanced. The AGENCY 
a See this volume, pp. 69-76.— Ed.

100 Capital and Profit 
through which this calculation is performed is the competition of 
capitals with each other. From the moment at which the surplus 
value is converted as profit, i.e. excess over the capital advanced, 
the second practical consequence follows, that a particular excess 
in proportion to the capital advanced forms the profit or the 
surplus value falling to its share, which stands in proportion to its 
magnitude—the magnitude of the production costs—and these 
come down to the value of the capital advanced. Profit thus 
equalised, levelled, expresses for capitals in one sphere of 
production a higher surplus value than they really produce 
directly, [XVI-993] for others a lower one, and for both the 
average of these higher and lower amounts. The absolute measure 
of this rate of profit naturally depends on the absolute proportion 
of the surplus value to the totality of the capital advanced. 
In fact the matter can be expressed in this way: 
Profit—as first transformation of surplus value—and the rate 
of profit in this first transformation—expresses surplus value in 
proportion to the individual overall capital of which it is the 
product—treating all parts of this overall capital as uniform, and 
relating to the whole of it as a homogeneous sum of value, without 
regard to the organic relation in which the different components 
of this capital stand towards the creation of its surplus value. 
Empirical or average profit expresses the same transformation, 
the same process, in that it relates the total amount of surplus 
value, hence the surplus value realised by the whole capitalist class, 
to the total capital, or the capital employed by the whole capitalist 
class,  in exactly this way—it relates the total surplus value as profit 
to that total capital of society, without regard to the organic 
relation in which the individual components of that total capital 
have participated directly in the production of that total surplus 
value, on  behalf,  that is, of the individual independent capitals or 
the individual capitalists in the particular sphere of production. 
Just as, for example, with the individual capital of £900, if it yields 
a surplus value of £90, this profit is related equally to all 
components of the £900, and every component of the latter is 
valorised at 10%, thus, it may be, the 350 fixed capital, the 350 
capital for raw material, and the 200 capital for wages, each 
provides 10%, each therefore produces a profit in proportion to 
its magnitude—"the capitalist generally expects an equal profit 
upon all the parts of the capital which he advances" (Malthus)56— 
so the total capital C socially, or the total amount of all the capitals 
of all the individual capitalists, is related to 5, the surplus value, as 
the rate of profit r, for example, and every part of this total 

=====第111页=====
Costs of Production 101 
capital participates in the proportion r to P or S, hence in 
proportion to the magnitude of its value, irrespective of its direct 
functional relation in the production of S. 
The second transformation is a necessary result of the first, 
which emerges from the nature of capital  itself,  whereby the 
surplus value is converted into an excess of value over production 
costs,  i.e. the value of the capital advanced. In the first case, the 
absolute magnitude of the surplus value=that of the profit; but 
the rate of profit is less than the rate of surplus value. In the 
second case the absolute magnitude of the total surplus value=the 
magnitude of the total profit; but the average rate of profit is less 
than the average rate of surplus value (i.e. the ratio of surplus 
value to the total value of the variable capital contained in the total 
capital). 
The transformation is formal in the first case, in the second 
material at the same time, since now the profit that falls to the 
share of the individual capital is in practice a different magnitude 
from the surplus value created by it, it is larger or smaller. In the 
first case, the surplus value is calculated only according to the 
magnitude of the capital which produces this particular surplus 
value, without regard to the capital's organic components. In the 
second case, the share of the individual independent capital in the 
total surplus value is calculated in accordance with this capital's 
magnitude alone, without regard to its functional relation to the 
production of that total surplus value. 
In the second case, therefore, an essential difference enters the 
picture, both between profit and surplus value and between the 
price and the value of the commodity. Hence the difference 
between the real prices—even the normal prices of the com­
modities—and their values. The more detailed [XVI-994] investi­
gation of this point belongs to the chapter on competition?7 in 
which it will also need be demonstrated how it is that despite 
this difference between the normal prices of commodities and 
their values, alterations in the value of the commodity modify its 
price. 
But it will be understood from the outset how through the 
confusion of empirical profit with surplus value—which profit 
presents in a very transformed form (just as through the 
confusion of the difference itself which corresponds to this 
between the normal prices and the values of commodities)—and 
this confusion is a common feature of all previous political 
economy, to a greater or lesser degree (only with the distinction 
that the more deep-going political economists such as Ricardo, 
8-613

Smith, etc., directly reduce profit to surplus value, i.e. want to 
display the abstract laws of surplus value directly through 
empirical profit, because otherwise any attempt to gain knowledge 
of the laws [of political economy] would have to be abandoned— 
whereas the economic plebs do the opposite, and directly set up 
and proclaim as laws of surplus value the phenomena of empirical 
profit; in reality proclaiming the semblance of lawlessness to be 
the law itself) [...]" 
The competition of capitals is nothing more than the realisation 
of the immanent laws of capital, i.e. of capitalist production, in 
that each capital confronts the other as the executor of these laws, 
the individual capitals bringing their inner nature to bear by the 
external compulsion which they exert on each other, according to 
their inner nature. But in competition the immanent laws of 
capital, of capitalist production, appear as the result of the 
mechanical impact of the capitals on each other; hence inverted 
and upside down. What is effect appears as cause, the converted 
form appears as the original one, etc. Vulgar political economy 
therefore explains everything it does not understand from 
competition, i.e. to state the phenomenon in its most superficial 
form counts for it as knowing the laws of the phenomenon.83 
If a capital which turns over 6 times in a year only takes a profit 
2 times smaller than a capital which turns over 3 times, one which 
employs much labour does not take any more profit than one 
which employs much fixed capital, one which suffers long 
interruptions in the production process itself no less than one 
which proceeds without interruption, etc., this means nothing but 
that the capitalists calculate the profit they make on the capital's 
size, not on its direct causal connection with the process. 
If each capitalist adds 10% to his production costs, this means 
nothing but that one capitalist adds a given amount more, the 
other adds a given amount less, than he really produces over and 
above those production costs. 
It is in one respect the same as when the individual capitalists 
sell their commodities above or below their value because they are 
cheating or being cheated. The one realises more surplus value 
than he produced, the other less. But the two divide among 
themselves, even if for accidental motives, and unequally, the total 
surplus value their two capitals have produced. The same thing 
takes place with average profit or empirical profit, only following a 
general law which is entirely independent of the personal frauds

committed by capitalists against each other, but rather asserts itself 
against and through these activities. 
Adam Smith's assertion that the capitalists would have no reason 
to employ a large instead of a small capital, unless profit bore 
some proportion to the magnitude of the capitals, is naive but 
incorrect.84 Leaving aside its shallowness—a larger capital with a 
smaller profit may after all—within [XVI-999] certain limits— 
realise a greater amount of profit than a smaller capital with a 
greater rate of profit. The motive for the employment of larger 
capitals would therefore remain. What is alone important in 
Smith's case is that he feels the difficulty of explaining this at all, 
whereas with the oeconomista vulgaris it is self-evident, just as 
everything is self-evident with that fellow. 
The situation arises simply from this, that with the conversion of 
surplus value into profit the value of the capital advanced is 
converted into the production costs of the individual capitalists, 
the magnitude of these production costs is therefore converted 
into the magnitude of the capital advanced, which means that they 
calculate the same magnitude of the product—the actual product 
of capital is profit—in proportion to these production costs, so 
that the division of the total surplus value as it is present in 
empirical profit can take place. The relation of supply in 
particular branches of production gives rise of itself to this 
levelling and this average calculation. 
The last point which has still to be considered under this 
heading is the entirely fossilised form capital has taken on these 
days,  and the completion of the mystification peculiar to the 
capitalist mode of production. 
We must return to this point 
Hence the phrase (of Torrens) that with the advance of 
civilisation it is not labour but capital, that determines the value of 
commodities. Similarly, that capital is productive, irrespective of 
the labour employed by it. (Ramsay, Malthus, Torrens, etc.)86 
h) In relation to the costs of production there is a further 
phenomenon to be discussed: why with the development of 
capitalist production, and therefore of the volume and measure of 
development of fixed capital, the mania to prolong the normal 
working day sets in to such a degree that the intervention of 
governments becomes necessary everywhere precisely at that point. 
But this can come later.

104 Capital and Profit 
7) [GENERAL LAW OF THE FALL IN THE RATE OF PROFIT 
WITH THE PROGRESS OF CAPITALIST PRODUCTION] 
We have seen (6 g))a that real profit—i.e. the current average 
profit and its rate—is different for the individual capital from 
profit, and therefore from the rate of profit, in so far as the latter 
consists of the surplus value really produced by the individual 
capital and the rate of profit therefore=the ratio of the surplus 
value to the total amount of the capital advanced. But it was also 
shown that considering the sum total of the capitals which are 
employed in the various particular spheres of production, the total 
amount of the social capital, or, and this is the same thing, the total 
capital of the capitalist class, the average rate of profit is nothing 
other than the total surplus value related to and calculated on this 
total capital; that it is related to the total capital exactly in the way 
in which profit—and therefore the rate of profit—is related to 
the individual capital, in so far as profit is considered only as 
surplus value which has been converted formally. Here, therefore, 
we once again stand on firm ground, where, without entering into 
the competition of the many capitals, we can derive the general 
law directly from the general nature of capital as so far developed. 
This law, and it is the most important law of political economy, is 
that the rate of profit has a tendency to fall with the progress of capitalist 
production. 
[XVI-1000] Since the general rate of profit is nothing but the 
ratio of the total amount of surplus value to the total amount of 
capital employed by the capitalist class, we are not concerned here 
with the different branches into which surplus value is divided, 
such as industrial profit, interest, rent. Since all these different 
forms of surplus value are only components of the total surplus 
value, one part may increase because the other declines. We are 
concerned here, however, with a fall in the rate of the total 
surplus value. Even the rent of land—as Adam Smith has already 
correctly noted—falls with the development of capitalist produc­
tion, instead of rising, not in proportion to the particular area of 
land of which it appears to be the product, but in proportion to 
the capital invested in agriculture, therefore precisely in the form 
in which it steps forth directly as a component of surplus value.87 
This law is confirmed by the whole of modern agronomy. (See 
Dombasle,88 Jones,89 etc.) 
So where does this tendency for the general rate of profit to fall 
come from? Before this question is answered, one may point out 
a See this volume, p.  91.—  Ed.

that it has caused a great deal of anxiety to bourgeois political 
economy. The whole of the Ricardian and Malthusian school is a 
cry of woe over the day of judgement this process would inevitably 
bring about, since capitalist production is the production of profit, 
hence loses its stimulus, the soul which animates it, with the fall in 
this profit. Other economists have brought forward grounds of 
consolation, which are not less characteristic. But apart from 
theory there is also the practice, the crises from * superabundance 
of capital or, what comes to the same, the mad adventures capital 
enters upon in consequence of the lowering of [the] rate of profit. 
Hence crises—see Fullarton90—acknowledged as a necessary 
violent means for the cure of the plethora of capital, and the 
restoration of a sound rate of profit.* 
//Fluctuations in the rate of profit, independent of organic 
CHANGES in the components of capital, or of the absolute magnitude 
of capital, are possible if the value of the capital advanced, 
whether it is engaged in the form of fixed capital, or exists as raw 
material, finished commodities, etc., rises or falls in consequence 
of an increase or reduction, independent of the already existing 
capital, in the labour time needed for its reproduction, since the 
value of every commodity—hence also of the commodities of 
which the capital consists—is conditioned not only by the 
necessary labour time contained in it  itself,  but by the necessary— 
socially necessary—labour time which is required for its reproduc­
tion, and this reproduction may occur under circumstances which 
hinder or facilitate it, and are different from the conditions of the 
original production. If under the changed circumstances twice as 
much labour time, or, inversely, half as much, is generally 
required to reproduce the same capital, as was needed to produce 
it, that capital, presupposing that the value of money remains 
permanently unchanged, would now be worth 200 thalers, if it was 
previously worth 100, or, if it was previously worth 100, it might 
now only be worth 50. If this increase or decline in value were to 
affect uniformly all sections of capital, profit too, like the capital, 
would now be expressed in twice as many or in half as many 
thalers. The rate would remain unchanged. 5 is related to 50 as 10 
to 100 or 20:200. Let us assume however that the nominal value 
of fixed capital and raw material alone rises, and that they form 4/s 
of 100, hence 80, the variable capital forming Vs, hence 20. In this 
case the surplus value, hence the profit, would continue to be 
expressed in [XVI-1001] the same sum of money. Thus the rate of 
profit would have risen or fallen. In the first case surplus 
value=10 thalers, which makes 10% on 100. But the 80 are now

106 Capital and Profit 
worth 160, hence the total capital  =180.  10 on 
180=1/i8=10°/i8=100:18 = 5 =  55/9%,  instead of the previous 10%. In 
the second case 40 instead of 80, the total capital=60, on which 
10=1/6=10%- 100:6=16=162/3%. But these fluctuations can never 
be general, unless they affect the commodities which enter into the 
worker's consumption, hence unless they affect variable capital, 
hence the whole of capital. In this case, however, the rate of profit 
remains unchanged, even though the amount of profit has 
changed nominally. // 
The general rate of profit can never rise or fall through a rise 
or fall in the total value of the capital advanced. If the value of the 
capital advanced, expressed in money, rises, the nominal monetary 
expression of the surplus value rises too. The rate remains 
unchanged. Ditto in the case of a fall. 
The general rate of profit can only fall: 
1) if the absolute magnitude of surplus value falls. The latter 
has, inversely, a tendency to rise in the course of capitalist 
production, for its growth is identical with the development of the 
productive power of labour, which is developed by capitalist 
production; 
2) because the ratio of variable capital to constant capital falls. 
As we have seen, the rate of profit is always smaller than the rate 
of surplus value which is expressed in it.a But the larger the ratio 
of constant to variable capital, the smaller it is. Or, the same rate 
of surplus value is expressed in a rate of profit which is the 
smaller, the larger the ratio of the total amount of capital 
advanced to the variable part of the latter, or the greater a part 
the constant capital forms of the total capital. Surplus value 
S expressed as profit is —— , and the larger C is, the smaller this 
magnitude, and the more it diverges from ,the rate of surplus 
V S value. For would reach its maximum when C=0, 
C+v u S S hence  = — 
C + v v 
But the law of development of capitalist production (see 
Cherbuliez,b etc.) consists precisely in the continuous decline of 
variable capital, i.e. the part of capital laid out in wages, in return 
for living labour—the variable component of capital — in relation 
to the constant component of capital, i.e. to the part of capital

which consists in fixed capital and in the CIRCULATING  CAPITAL  laid out 
for raw material and matières instrumentales." The whole develop­
ment of relative surplus value, i.e. of the productive power of 
labour, i.e. of capital, consists, as we have seen, 91 in the curtailment 
of necessary labour time, hence also the reduction of the total 
amount of the capital exchanged for labour, through the increase 
in the production of surplus labour by means of division of 
labour, machinery, etc., cooperation, and the expansion in the 
amount of value and the mass of constant capital expended which 
this involves, accompanied by a reduction in the capital expended 
for labour. 
So when the ratio of variable capital to the total amount of 
capital alters, the rate of profit falls, i.e. the ratio of surplus value 
to the variable part of capitalb is the smaller, [XVI-1002] the 
smaller the ratio of variable capital to constant capital. 
If, for example, in the production of India the ratio of the 
capital laid out as wages to the constant capital = 5:l, and in 
England it is 1:5, it is clear that the rate of profit in India must 
appear much larger, even if the surplus value actually realised is 
much smaller. Let us take 500. If the variable capital=500/5=100, 
the surplus value 40, the rate of surplus value will be 40%, the 
rate of profit only 10%. In contrast, if the variable part is 400 and 
the rate of surplus value is only 20%, this would make 80 on 400, 
and on 500 a rate of profit of 80:500, of 8:50. 8:50=16:100. 
Therefore 16%. (100:16=500:80 or 50:8 = 250:40 or 25:4=125:20. 
25x20 =  500.  4x125 = 500.) So although labour would be twice as 
strongly exploited in Europe as in India, the rate of profit in India 
would be related to the rate of profit in Europe as 16:10, as 
8:5,= l:5/s- Hence as 1:0,625. And indeed this is because 4/s of the 
total capital is exchanged for living labour in India, and only Vs in 
Europe. If real wealth appears slight in those countries where the 
rate of profit is high, it is because the productive power of labour 
is slight, a fact which is expressed precisely in the high rate of 
profit. 20% is Vs on labour time, hence India could only feed 7s of 
the population not directly involved in the product; whereas 40% 
is 2/s, hence in England twice the proportion of the population 
could live without working.92

the rise in the ratio in which objectified labour is exchanged for 
living labour.93 
The development of productive power has a double manifesta­
tion: [Firstly,] in the magnitude of the productive forces already 
produced, in the amount of value and the physical extent of the 
conditions of production under which new production takes place, 
i.e. the absolute magnitude of the productive capital already 
accumulated. Secondly, in the relative smallness of the capital laid 
out for wages, in comparison with the total capital, i.e. the 
relatively small amount of living labour which is required for the 
reproduction and exploitation of a large capital — for mass 
production. 
This implies, at the same time, the concentration of capital in 
large amounts at a small number of places. The same capital is 
large if it employs 1,000 workers united into a single labour force, 
small if it is divided into 500 businesses employing two workers 
apiece. 
If the ratio of the variable part of capital to the constant part, or 
to the total capital, is large, as in the above example, this shows 
that all the means towards the development of the productivity of 
labour have not been employed, that, in a word, the social forces of 
labour have not been developed, that therefore with a large 
quantity of labour little is produced, [XVI-1003] whereas in the 
opposite case a (relatively) large amount is produced with a small 
amount of labour. 
The development of fixed capital (which produces of itself a 
development of the circulating capital laid out in raw material and 
matières instrumentales (see Sismondi 94) is a particular symptom of 
the development of capitalist production. It implies a direct 
reduction, relatively speaking, of the variable part of capital, i.e. a 
lessening in the quantity of living labour. The two are identical. 
This is most striking in agriculture, where the reduction is not 
only relative but absolute. 
//Adam Smith's idea that the general rate of profit is forced 
down by competition96—on the presupposition that capitalists and 
workers alone confront each other—or that the division of surplus 
value among different classes is not further considered—comes 
down to saying that profit does not fall because wages rise; but 
wages do indeed rise because profit falls, hence it is—from the 
point of view of the result, an increase in wages corresponding to 
the fall of profit—the same mode of explanation as Ricardo's 
completely opposite one, in which profit falls because wages 
become more expensive, etc.,97 or as Carey's, because there is an

increase not only in costs of production (exchange value) but in 
the use value of the wage.98  That profit TEMPORARILY falls as a result 
of competition between capitals—i.e. their competition in the 
demand for labour—is admitted by all political economists (see 
Ricardo").  Adam Smith's explanation,  * if he did not speak of 
industrial profits only, would raise this to a general law very 
contradictory to the laws of wage[s] developed by  himself.*// 
The development of productive power has a double manifesta­
tion: in the increase of surplus labour, i.e. the curtailment of the 
necessary labour time; and in the reduction of the component of 
capital which is exchanged with living labour, relatively to the total 
amount of capita!, i.e. the total value of the capital which enters 
into production. (See Surplus Value, Capital, etc. 00) Or, expressed 
differently: It is manifested in the greater exploitation of the 
living labour employed (this follows from the greater quantity of 
use values which it produces in a given time, /iinca the curtailment 
of the time required for the reproduction of the wage, hinc the 
prolongation of the labour time appropriated by the capitalist 
without equivalent) and in the reduction in the relative amount of 
living labour time which is employed in general—i.e. in its amount 
relatively to the capital that sets it in motion. Both movements not 
only go [hand in hand] but condition each other. They are only 
different forms and phenomena in which the same law is 
expressed. But they work in opposite directions, in so far as the 
rate of profit comes into consideration. Profit is surplus value 
related to the total capital, and the rate of profit is the ratio of this 
surplus value, calculated according to a particular measure of the 
capital, e.g. as a percentage. However, surplus value—as an 
overall quantity—is determined firstly by its rate, but secondly by 
the amount of labour employed simultaneously at this rate, or, 
and this is the same thing, the magnitude of the variable part of 
the capital. On the one hand there is a rise in the rate of surplus 
value, on the other hand there is a (relative) fall in the numerical 
factor by which this RATE is multiplied. In so far as the 
development of productive power lessens the necessary (paid) part 
of the labour employed, it raises the surplus value, because it 
raises its rate, or it raises it when expressed as a percentage. 
However, in so far as it lessens the total amount of labour 
employed by a given capital, it reduces the numerical factor by 
which the rate of surplus value is multiplied, hence it reduces its 
amount.

Surplus value is determined both by the rate, which expresses 
the ratio of surplus labour to necessary labour, and by the 
amount" of working days employed. However, with the develop­
ment of the productive forces, the latter—or the variable part of 
the capital—is reduced in relation to the capital laid out. 
If C =  500,  c=100, D=400, and S=60, s/,=60/4oo=15%, so that 
the rate of profit=60/5o0= 12%. [XVI-1004] Furthermore, if 
C = 500,  c=400, v = 100, and 5 =  30,  5/„=3%oo=30%, so that the 
rate of profit=30/5oo=6%. The rate of surplus value is doubled, the 
rate of profit is halved. The rate of surplus value exactly expresses 
the rate at which labour is exploited, while the rate of profit 
expresses the relative amount of living labour employed by capital 
at a given rate of exploitation, or the proportion of the capital laid 
out in wages, the variable capital, to the total amount of capital 
advanced. 
If C =  500,  c=400, and  t; = 100, for the rate of profit to be 12% 
or profit to be 60, surplus value would have to be 60, 
S/„=6°/ioo=60%. 
For the rate of profit to remain the same, the rate of surplus 
value (or the rate of exploitation of labour) would have to grow in 
the same ratio as the magnitude of the capital laid out in labour 
grows, in the same way as the magnitude of the variable capital 
falls relatively, or the magnitude of the constant capital grows 
relatively. It is already strikingly apparent from one single 
circumstance that this is only possible within certain limits, and 
that it is rather the reverse, the tendency towards a fall in 
profit—or a relative decline in the amount of surplus value hand 
in hand with the growth in the rate of surplus value—which must 
predominate, as is also confirmed by experience. The part of the 
value which capital newly reproduces and produces is=to the living 
labour time directly absorbed by it in its product. One part of this 
labour time replaces the labour time objectified in wages, the 
other part is the unpaid excess amount, surplus labour time. But 
both of them together form the whole amount of the value 
produced, and only a part of the labour employed forms the 
surplus value. If the normal day=12 hours, 2 workers who 
perform simple labour can never add more than 24 hours (and 
workers who perform higher labour can never add more than 
24 hours  X the factor which expresses the ratio of their working 
day to the simple working day), of which a definite part replaces 
a In the manuscript the word "number" is written over the word "amount".—

their wages. The surplus value they produce cannot, whatever the 
circumstances, be more than an aliquot part of 24 hours. If, 
instead of 24 workers, only 2 are employed to a given quantity of 
capital (in proportion to a given measure of capital), or 2 workers 
are necessary in the new mode of production where 24 were 
necessary in the old one, in proportion to a given amount of 
capital, then if the surplus labour in the old mode of 
production = '/i2 of the total working day, or=l hour, no increase 
in productive power—however much it raised the rate of surplus 
labour time—could have the effect that the 2 workers provided 
the same amount of surplus value as the 24 in the old mode of 
production. If one considers the development of productive power 
and the relatively not so pronounced fall in the rate of profit, the 
exploitation of labour must have increased very much, and what is 
remarkable is not the fall in the rate of profit but that it has not 
fallen to a greater degree. This can be explained partly by 
circumstances to be considered in dealing with competition 
between capitals,67 partly by the general circumstance that so far 
the immense increase of productive power in some branches has 
been paralysed or restricted by its much slower development in 
other branches, with the result that the general ratio of variable to 
constant capital—considered from the point of view of the total 
capital of society—has not fallen in the proportion which strikes 
us so forcibly in certain outstanding spheres of production. 
In general, therefore: The decline in the average rate of profit 
expresses an increase in the productive power of labour or of 
capital, and, following from that, on the one hand a heightened 
exploitation of the living labour employed, and [on the other 
hand] a relatively reduced amount of living labour employed at the 
heightened rate of exploitation, calculated on a particular amount 
of capital. 
It does not now follow automatically from this law that the 
accumulation of capital declines or that the absolute amount of 
profit falls (hence also the absolute, not relative, amount of surplus 
value, which is expressed in the profit). 
[XVI-1005] Let us stay with the above example.2 If the constant 
capital is only Vs of the total capital advanced, this expressed a low 
level of development of productive power, a limited scale of 
production, small, fragmented capitals. A capital of 500 of this 
kind, with surplus value at 15% (the variable capital at 400) gives a 
total amount of profit of 60. If we reverse the ratio, this expresses 
a See this volume, p. 110.— Ed. 

=====第122页=====
112 Capital and Profit 
a large scale, the development of productive power, cooperation, 
division of labour, and large-scale employment of fixed capital. Let 
us therefore assume that a capital of this kind is of 20 times 
greater extent; 500x20=10,000, thus 6% profit on 10,000 (or 
surplus value of 30%, if the variable capital = 2,000) 600. A capital 
of 10,000 therefore accumulates more quickly with 6% than a 
capital of 500 with 12%. The one realises a labour time of 400, the 
other one of 2,000, hence an absolute amount of labour time 
5 times greater, although relatively to its magnitude, or to a given 
amount of capital, e.g. 100, it employs four times less [labour 
time].  (See Ricardo's example.3101) 
Here, as in the whole of our analysis, we entirely disregard use 
value. With the greater productivity of capital it goes without 
saying that the same value employed at the more productive scale 
represents a much greater amount of use value than it does at the 
less productive scale, and therefore also provides the material for 
a much more rapid rate of growth of the population and 
consequently of labour powers. (See Jones.h) 
This fall in the rate of profit leads to an increase in the 
minimum amount of capital—or a rise in the level of concentration 
of the means of production in the hands of the capitalists— 
required in general to employ labour productively, both to exploit 
it, and to employ no more than the labour time socially required for 
the manufacture of a product. And there is a simultaneous growth 
in accumulation, i.e. concentration, since large capital accumulates 
more rapidly at a small rate of profit than does small capital at a 
large rate of profit. Once it has reached a certain level, this rising 
concentration in turn brings about a new fall in the rate of profit. 
The mass of the lesser, fragmented capitals are therefore ready to 
take risks. Hinc crisis. The so-called plethora of capital refers only 
to the plethora of capital for which the fall in the rate of profit is 
not counterbalanced by its size. (See Fullarton.90) 
Profit, however, is the driving AGENCY in capitalist production, 
and only those things are produced which can be produced at a 
profit, and they are produced to the extent to which they can be 
produced at a profit. Hence the anxiety of the English political 
economists about the reduction in the rate of profit. 
Ricardo already noted that the increase in the amount of profit 
accompanying a decline in the rate of profit is not absolute, but

that there may be a decline in the amount of profit  itself,  despite 
the growth of capital. Strangely enough, he did not grasp this in 
general, but merely gave an example.101 Nevertheless, the matter is 
very simple. 
500 at 20% gives 100 profit. 
50,000 at 10% gives  5,000  profit; but  5,000  at 2% would only 
give 100 profit, no more than 500 gives at 20%, and at 1% it 
would only give 50 profit, hence only half as much as 500 at 20%. 
In general: As long as the rate of profit falls more slowly than 
capital grows, there is a rise in the amount of profit and therefore 
the rate of accumulation, although relative profit declines. If the 
profit were to fall to the same degree as the capital grew, the 
amount of profit would, despite the growth in capital, remain the 
same as it was with a higher rate of profit on a smaller capital. 
This would therefore also be true of the rate of accumulation. 
Finally, if the rate of profit fell in a greater proportion than the 
growth in capital, the amount of profit and therewith the rate of 
accumulation would fall along with the rate of profit, and it would 
stand lower than in the case of a smaller capital with a higher rate 
of profit at a correspondingly less developed stage of production. 
[XVI-1006] //We do not consider use value at all, except in so 
far as it determines the production costs of labour capacity or the 
nature of capital, as with fixed capital, because we are considering 
capital in general, not the real movement of capitals or competi­
tion.67 But it may be remarked here in passing that this production 
on a large scale, with a higher rate of surplus value and a reduced 
rate of profit, presupposes an immense production, and therefore 
consumption, of use values, hence always leads to periodic 
overproduction, which is periodically solved by expanded markets. 
Not because of a lack of demand, but a lack of paying demand. 
For the same process presupposes a proletariat on an ever-
increasing scale, therefore significantly and progressively restricts 
any demand which goes beyond the necessary means of subsist­
ence,  while it at the same time requires a constant extension of 
the sphere of demand. Malthus was correct to say that the demand 
of the worker can never suffice for the capitalist.3102 His profit 
consists precisely in the excess of the worker's supply over his 
demand. Every capitalist grasps this as far as his own workers are 
concerned, only not for the other workers, who buy his 
commodities. Foreign trade, luxury production, the state's ex­
travagance (the growth of state expenditure, etc.)—the massive

expenditure  on  fixed capital, etc.—hinder this process. (Hence 
sinecures, extravagance  on the  part  of the  state  and the 
unproductive classes,  are  recommended  by  Malthus, Chalmers, 
etc., as a  nostrum.3)  It remains curious that  the  same political 
economists  who  admit  the  periodic overproduction  of capital  (a 
periodic plethora  of capital  is admitted  by all  modern political 
economists) deny  the  periodic overproduction  of commodities.  As 
if the  simplest analysis  did not  demonstrate that both phenomena 
express  the  same antinomy, only  in a  different form.// 
That this mere possibility disturbs Ricardo (Malthus  and the 
RICARDIANS similarly) shows  his  deep understanding  of the  condi­
tions  of capitalist production. 104 The  reproach that  is made against 
him, that  in examining capitalist production  he is  unconcerned 
with "human beings", keeping  in view  the  development  of the 
productive forces alone—bought  at the  cost  of whatever sac­
rifices—without concerning himself with distribution  and  there­
fore consumption,  is precisely what  is great about  him. The 
development  of the  productive forces  of social labour  is the  historic 
task and  justification  of capital.  It is  exactly  by doing this that  it 
unconsciously creates  the  material conditions  for a  higher mode  of 
production. What makes Ricardo uneasy here  is that profit—the 
stimulus  of capitalist production  and the  condition  of accumula­
tion,  as also  the  driving force  for accumulation—is endangered  by 
the law of  development  of production  itself. And the  quantitative 
relation  is everything here. 
There  is in  reality  a deeper basis  for this, which Ricardo only 
suspects. What  is demonstrated here,  in a  purely economic manner, 
from  the  standpoint  of capitalist production  itself, is its  barrier— 
its relativity,  the fact that  it is not an  absolute,  but  only  an historical 
mode  of production, corresponding  to the  material conditions  of 
production  of a  certain restricted development period. 
To bring this important question  to a  decisive conclusion,  the 
following must first  be investigated: 
1) Why  does  it happen that with  the  development  of fixed 
capital, machinery,  etc., the  passion  for overwork, prolongation  of 
the normal working  day, in  short  the  mania  for  absolute surplus 
labour grows, along with precisely  the  mode  of production  in 
which relative surplus labour  is created? 
2) How is it  that  in capitalist production profit appears—from 
the point  of view  of the  individual capital, etc.—as  a necessary

condition of production, hence as forming part of the absolute 
production costs of capitalist production? 
If we take surplus value, its rate is greater, the smaller the 
variable capital in proportion to it, and less, the larger the variable 
s capital.  — rises or falls inversely as v rises or falls. If v=0, this [s] 
V 
would be at its maximum, for no outlay of capital for wages would 
be necessary, no labour would have to be paid in order to 
appropriate unpaid labour. Inversely: the expression , or the 
rate of profit, would be at its maximum if c=0, that is, if the rate 
of profit=the rate of [XVI-1007] surplus value, i.e. if no constant 
capital c at all had to be laid out in order to lay out capital v in 
s wages and thus realise it in surplus labour. The expression 
c+v 
therefore rises and falls inversely as c rises or falls, hence it also 
rises or falls against v. 
The rate of surplus value is greater, the smaller the variable 
capital in proportion to the surplus value. The rate of profit is 
greater, the greater the variable capital in proportion to the total 
capital, and this proportion is greater the smaller the constant 
capital in proportion to the total capital, hence also in the 
proportion to which it forms a smaller part of the total capital 
than the variable capital. But the variable capital for its part is 
smaller in proportion to the total capital, the greater the 
proportion of the total capital and therefore of the constant capital 
to the variable capital.

74-
For the rate of profit to remain the same at 15%, the surplus 
value would have to rise from 120 to 180, hence by 60 (but 
60:120=1:2), hence by a  half.  Furthermore, [a rise in] s' from 
12%oo or 20% to 180/6oo or 30%, from 20 to 30, is again [a rise] by 
50%. 
The surplus value had to increase in the same proportion as the 
total capital grew from 800 to  1,200,  i.e. by 50%, that is it had to 
increase from 20 to 30%. Originally v was 3/4 of the total capital, 
now it is 2/4. But 3A Cx20 is as much as 2/4 Cx30, namely 
(=15%). 
// It is self-evident that the variable capital may constantly grow 
in the absolute sense, i.e. the absolute number of workers may 
grow, although it is constantly falling in proportion to total capital 
and fixed capital. Hence the inane dispute over whether machin­
ery reduces the number of workers. It almost always reduces the 
number when introduced, not in the sphere in which it has itself 
been introduced, but through the suppression of workers who 
carry on the same industry at the previous stage of production. 
For example the machine spinners drive out the hand spinners, 
the machine weavers the hand weavers, etc. But in the branch of 
industry which employs the machinery the number of workers 
may grow constantly in the absolute sense //although here men 
are often driven out by WOMEN and YOUNG PERSONS// although it 
declines relatively. // 
[XVI-995] Let us first assemble the facts. 
C=v + c. i=surplus value. s'=rate of surplus value, p' =rate of 
s profit.  s'= s/v, p'-s/c  or -—-. 
C = 800.  c=200. v=600. 5=120. In this case,  c =  lUC (800/4=200) 
and v=s/4c(=3^  =xxj;  5' =  120/600=20%.  If c increases from 200 
to 600, by a factor of three, C will rise from 800 to  1,200,  i.e. by 
50%. 
Since  c —  lUC its threefold increase causes it to grow from 'A to 
74 (by 2/4). The total capital is now 74C + 3/4C= 12/4C It has

I20/8oo to 120/,,20o or 1*/8oo:120/i.2oo=3:2; hence as a fall of 7s or 
33Vs%. 
The fall in the rate of profit therefore depends directly on the 
growth in the total capital, if the variable capital remains the same; 
its fall expresses itself in inverse proportion to the growth of the 
capital. // this grows from 2:3, the rate of profit falls from 3:2. 
Furthermore, if the variable capital remains the same, the growth 
of the total capital can only derive from the growth of the constant 
capital. However, the proportion in which a particular increase in 
constant capital causes the total capital to increase depends on the 
original ratio between c and C. This inverse relation explains in 
part why the rate of profit does not fall in the same proportion as 
the capital increases, even if the rate of surplus [value] remains the 
same. If 2 increases to 4, that is a growth of 100%. If 4 falls to 2, 
that is a fall of 50%. 
b) If in the second case indicated above the rate of profit is to 
remain the same, the profit, hence the surplus value, will have to 
rise from 120 to 180, i.e. by 60 or 7a of 120, rise by half its 
original magnitude. The surplus value would therefore have

therefore rising in a greater proportion than the fall in the rate of 
profit, surplus value remaining the same. 
If c had risen to 1,200 instead of 600, the total capital would 
have risen to  1,800,  for C would have risen by  1,000,  hence by

100%,  and 30 on 120 is lU or 25% (4x30=120)  [...]%.) 
c) How in this case (b) would s' or surplus value have risen? 
It was originally 120/6oo=20% or Vs of the variable capital. If the 
capital grows to 1,200 or c is tripled, 18%oo or 30% or [...]. In the 
third  CASE,  if the capital grows to  1,800,  [surplus value is] 27%oo=9/2o 
of the variable capital,  =45%.  In [this case the rate of] surplus 
value has risen from 20 to 30%, i.e. by 50%, to the same degree as 
the total capital has grown in this case and the absolute surplus 
value or [... has risen in this] case from 20 to 45; i.e. by 25; but 
25:20= l'/4  (20  + V420  or 5) hence 125%. (This [...] only on the 
growth of the increment, not the relation of the numbers to each 
other as such.) The rate of surplus value would therefore have to 
[grow] directly [as the] total capital grew or in the same proportion 
as the absolute surplus value would have to grow for the rate of 
profit to remain unaltered with a growing [...]. 
Variable capital amounted to 
Case I: 600 out of total constant 
capital 800=3/4C; capital 200='/4C 
Case II: 600 » 1,200=2/4C; .. 600 =  2/4 C

Surplus value or profit had to increase to 540; the rate of 
surplus value=540/6oo, 9/io or 90%. 90% against 20 [...] of 70. But 
70 to 20 would be 350%. The increase of capital would be

[...] and the rate of surplus value, which is an identical relation 
if variable capital remains the same, does not grow as capital grows 
or variable capital [...] total capital. There is absolutely no rational 
reason why the rise of productive power should observe exactly 
the same numerical ratio. It [...] of relative surplus value grows 
and its growth is expressed in the ratio of the reduction in the 
variable capital [...], but not in the same ratio as this proportion

production. The surplus value, [...] the labour time which he himself 
works, not by the working days he  replaces.  If 90 men worked only V2 
an hour of surplus time a day, this would be [...] hours. If the one 
man needed only one hour of necessary labour time, he would 
never [produce] more than 11 hours of surplus value. [The 
pro]cess is double. It increases the surplus labour time of the 
working day, but it also reduces the numerical coefficients of those 
working days, [...] capital. Secondly: The development of produc­
tive power is not uniform; certain branches of industry may 
themselves be more unproductive [...] but this is determined by 
the general productivity of capital. 
[...] firstly at a stage of production which remains the same, 
without great revolutions in productive power, in proportion to its 
already existing [...] only gives rise to a total capital of 2, whereas 
1,000 at 10% gives  1,100.  c. 1,100 prod[... Ex]ample of 800, 
v = 600,  c = 200,  and surplus value=160 or rate of profit equal to 
20%,  a capital of 100,000 would give [...] instead of 3/4 only 
'/6 variable, (3/4=18/24, and '/6=4/24) hence employs I4/24 or 7/i2 less 
variable capital relatively speaking, at [...] 50% it continues to be 
5,000. His variable capital, and the living labour employed by it, 
would still be 16,66676 in total amount, hence [...] it would still be 
nearly 28 times greater than the capital employed in the first case. 
But the rate of profit is determined, because the rate of surplus 
value is determined, by the ratio of the variable capital to the total 
capital. At simple interest £100,000 would grow into 200,000 in 20 
years,  whereas 800 at 20% would only produce an accumulation of 
3,200 in 20 years (160x20). In the second 20 years 200,000 at 5% 
would grow to 400,000. The other capital at 20%, in contrast, 
would only grow to 12,800.

General Law of the Fall in the Rate of Profit 123 
[a] As a rule //see under surplus value106 for the exception: 
intensification of labour and therefore in fact increase of labour by 
machinery// machinery only creates relative surplus value through 
the curtailment of necessary labour time and therefore the 
prolongation of surplus labour time. This result is brought about 
by the cheapening of the commodities which enter directly or 
indirectly into the worker's consumption. 
Surplus value is formed by two factors. Firstly the daily surplus 
labour of the individual worker. This determines the rate of surplus 
value, hence also the proportion in which variable capital is 
increased through the exchange with living labour. Secondly, the 
number of workers simultaneously exploited by capital or the 
number of simultaneous working days. 
If the rate of surplus value is given, the magnitude of the 
surplus value—the surplus value itself as an independent mag­
nitude—depends on the number of workers employed. If this 
[number and the number of simultaneous] working days is given, 
the magnitude of the surplus value depends on its rate. 
[...] now evidently has a tendency to affect the two factors of 
surplus value in opposite directions. It increases the rate [...] 
reduces the number of workers // relatively anyway; with respect to 
a definite measure of capital, e.g. per cent//, whose labour [...] is 
exploited at an increased rate. 
[...] each one provided 1 hour of surplus labour a day. By the 
employment of machinery 6 workers should each provide 2 hours 
of surplus labour a day [...] In this case 6 workers provide 
12 hours of surplus labour, just as previously 12 did. The time 
during which the 12 workers [work] every day, assuming [a 
norm]al working day of 12 hours, [can] be regarded as a total 
working day of 144 hours, of which [132 hours are necessary 
labour] time, 12 surplus labour time. In the second case the total 
working day consists of 72 hours, of which 60 are necessary labour 
time,  [12 surplus labour  time].  Since a total working day of 72 
hours now contains as much surplus labour as the day of 144 
hours,  in the latter case [6 workers] appear [to be use]less, 
superfluous for the production of 12 hours of surplus value. They 
are therefore suppressed by the employment of machinery. 
[...]—which  lies at the basis of all growth in relative surplus 
value—prolongation of surplus labour time through [curtailment 
of necessary] labour time; however, a process which was only 
employed previously in regard to the working day of the 
individual worker is now employed [...] composed of the sum total 
of the working days of the workers simultaneously employed. The

of labour remains the same. It is merely their division between 
necessary and surplus labour, between [...], which is altered. But

also in the sum total of labour time employed. 
[...] total working day of 144 hours e.g., which is no longer 
necessary, since the employment of machinery, to [produce] 12 
hours of surplus labour. Superfluous, useless labour is removed. 
From the capitalist standpoint all labour is useless, i.e. unproductive, 
which is not necessary [...], which would therefore be required for 
the mere reproduction of the worker  himself.  In the above 
example 72 [...], i.e. 6 days of labour. I.e. 6 of the 12 workers are 
dismissed. In the first case the magnitude remains [... (...] hours 
contained in it) the same. The division alone has changed. In the 
second case the magnitude changes—the total amount [...] the 
division of the same. In the first case, therefore, the value remains 
the same, while the surplus value increases. In the second case [...] at 
the same time the labour time objectified in the product, while the 
surplus [value] increases.

This is as with [...] Relatively to the product [...] the number of 
workers is reduced [...] workers [...] capital C [... con]stant [...], 
[XVI-997] with machinery, an absolute reduction (with regard to a 
particular capital) takes place. In certain branches of industry, 
agriculture [...] reduction is in fact always in advance, without 
being CHECKED as in other branches of industry  BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE 
THAT AT THE NEW RATE [...] OLD NUMBER OF LABOURERS MAY BE SUCCESSIVELY 
ABSORBED, BUT EVEN AN  ABSOLUTE[LY]  GREATER ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY MUCH 
SMALLER X [...] 
The way in which the rate of profit is altered even in the case 
considered above, where the rate of surplus value grows in the 
same (or [a greater proportion]) than the fall in the number of 
workers, hence the fall in one factor finds compensation in the 
growth of the other through more  [...]—hence  the magnitude of 
the surplus value remains unchanged or even grows—depends on 
the proportion in which [...] is [affected by] a CHANGE in the 
components of the total capital or on the proportion in which 
this CHANGE proceeds. [...] The surplus value the capital makes 
can only derive from the number of workers it exploits, or from the 
number of workers who [...] society — alias the class of capitalists as a 
whole—is affected by the setting free of the workers he has dismis­
sed, [...] 
It is now an entirely self-evident general law that with the

progressive increase in the employment of machinery the mag­
nitude [...] remain, but must fall; i.e. that the reduction in the 
number of the [...] (in relation to a particular measure of capital) 
[...] reduction in the number cannot be continuously counterbal­
anced by a corresponding increase in the rate of surplus value [...] the 
working day of the individual worker is exploited. 
Assume that 50 workers provide only 2 hours of surplus 
[labour];  in that case the surplus value created by them=100. 
Assume further [...] if 10 men were replaced by 1, 5 would re­
place the 50. [...] labour time = 5x  12, = 72a hours. The same for 
the total value of their product. The surplus [value] created by 
them [is]<than 72, since only equal to 72—the necessary 
labour time. Hence it is<than 100 by much more. There therefore 
takes place [...], so large that the reduction in the absolute 
amount of labour which is employed, brought about through 
the development of productive power, [...] by an increase of equal 
size in the rate of surplus value—where surplus value therefore 
falls,  despite the growth in the rate of surplus value. [...] A fall in 
the amount of surplus value — or the total amount of surplus 
labour employed — must necessarily come about with the develop­
ment of machinery [...] it is [shown] here that capitalist produc­
tion enters into contradiction with the development of the produc­
tive forces and is by no means their absolute [...] and final form. 
//If the 50 workers could all be employed at the new rate, or 
even only 25 perhaps, surplus value would grow, and not only its 
rate,  as compared with the earlier CASE. Hence the importance of 
the scale on which machinery is employed, and its tendency to 
employ as many workers as possible at the same time, combined 
with the tendency to pay for as few necessary working days as 
possible.// (50) (150) 
ß) Let us assume a capital of 600. Let 400 of this be laid out in 
labour, 200 in constant capital, instruments and raw material. Let 
the 400 represent 10 workers. If a machine were to be employed, 
which together with the raw material=520, and if the capital laid 
out in labour were only to be 80 now, 10 workers would be 
replaced by 2 or 5 by 1. The total amount of capital laid out 
would remain the same, hence production costs would remain the 
same. The 2 workers would not produce more surplus labour time 
for each 12 hours than the 10 produced, for wages would have 
remained the same. Nevertheless, the quantities of commodities 
produced under the changed conditions of production might on

certain presuppositions become cheaper, although  it is  presup­
posed that this quantity  has not  increased,  or that  no  more 
commodities  are  produced with  the  same capital under  the new 
process  of production than were previously produced under  the 
old one.  Since  the  same quantity  of raw  material  has  been worked 
on as before,  150, the  machinery  has now  risen from  50 to 370. 
//Namely  370  machinery,  150 raw  material,  80  labour. 
370+150 + 80 = 600.// 
Assume  now  that  the  machinery employed  has a  turnover time 
//reproduction time//  of 10  years.  Of the  value employed,  37 
(37%o)  would enter into  the  annual output  of commodities  for the 
replacement,  WEAR  AND  TEAR,  of the machinery. The sum total of the 
production costs  of the  commodities //disregarding profit  and 
surplus value here,  as the  rate remains  the  same// would  now 
be=37+150 + 80=267.  The  production cost  of the  commodity 
under  the old  process=600, whereby  we  assume that  the 
instruments which enter into  the  process (estimated  at 50)  must  be 
renewed every year.  The  price  of the  commodities would have 
been cheapened  in the  ratio 267:600.  To the  extent that  the 
commodity enters into  the  worker's consumption,  its cheapening 
would bring about  a reduction  in the  labour necessary  for his 
reproduction  and  thereby  an increase  in the  length  of surplus 
labour time.  //But  initially,  as in any  employment  of machines, 
capitalist  II would admittedly sell cheaper than capitalist  I, but not 
in the  same proportion  as his  production costs  had  fallen. This  is 
in fact  an anticipation  of the  cheapening  of the  production costs  of 
labour which occurs through machinery  [...] [If] his  workers 
receive  the  same wages  as previously, they  can  admittedly  buy 
more commodities (more  of the  commodities they themselves have 
produced)  but not in the  proportion  in which they have become 
more productive.  It would  be the  same thing  if the  capitalist paid 
them  in his own  commodity,  as if he  were  to give them  a quantity 
which  was  admittedly larger,  but  smaller  in the  proportion  to 
which this quantity expressed exchange value.// Even  if we 
disregard  the  relation  itself, and  consider  the  empirical form,  in 
which  the  capitalist calculates interest,  say 5%, on his  total capital 
according  to the  part  of it  which  has not  been consumed. Then 
5% on 300 (the  part  of the  capital  not  consumed  in the  first 
year)=15,  or 5%  profit  e.g.,  similarly  15,  therefore  30.  Thus  the 
price  of the  commodities would come  to 280 + 30 = 310, still almost 
half as cheap  as in the  first case.107 
In fact only  370  thalers were laid  out for  fixed capital, 
150 capital  for raw  material,  and 80 for  labour. 108

However, if in order to replace 5 workers by one the capital [...] 
the machinery had to increase from 50 to perhaps 2,000 instead of 
370, the total capital therefore rising to 2,300, the  WEAR AND TEAR

amount of commodities than before is not produced, then this is 
even more so in the other case. 
This belongs to the section on production  costs, 3 just as the previous 
comments on surplus value must be treated under the heading 
"Surplus Value".109 
//The total amount of the capital advanced enters into the labour 
process, but only the part of the capital consumed during a 
particular period of the labour process enters into the valorisation 
process or into the value of the product. (See Malthus}) Hence the 
smaller value or the greater cheapness of the commodities which 
are e.g. produced with the same capital of 500, if 2 /ä of this are 
fixed capital and '/s variable capital, than if the proportions are 
inverted. (Even if profit and interest are calculated on the whole 
of the capital, only an aliquot part of it enters into the value of the 
commodity, not the capital  itself,  as in the case in which the whole 
of the capital or the greatest part of it is laid out in living labour.) 
But the profit is calculated on the whole of the capital, including 
the unconsumed part of it. Although the unconsumed part of the 
capital does not enter into the value of the product of the 
individual capital considered for  itself,  it does enter into the 
average production costs of capitalist production, in the form of 
profit (interest), because it constitutes an element of the average 
profit, and an  ITEM  in the calculation by means of which the 
capitalists divide among themselves the total surplus value of the 
capital. // 
//The rate of profit depends upon, or is nothing other than, the 
ratio of the surplus value (considered as an absolute magnitude) to 
the magnitude of the capital advanced. But the surplus value 
itself—i.e. its absolute magnitude — may fall even though the rate 
of surplus value rises, and rises considerably. The amount of 
surplus value or its absolute magnitude must indeed fall, despite 
any rise whatever in the rate of surplus value, once the [...] of 
surplus value of the labour which is displaced by machinery is 
greater than the total amount of value, or labour,32 which steps into 
its place. Or the surplus time of the displaced worker[s] is greater 
than the total labour time of the workers who replace them. Thus if 
50 are replaced by 5. And the surplus labour time of the 50 was 2 
hours (with a normal working day of 12 hours). Their surplus 
labour time or the surplus value created by them=100 hours. The 
total labour time or the value created [by the 5] (hence the

necessary labour time+surplus) = 60 hours. Assume that these 
5 workers provide twice as much surplus time, or that surplus 
value=4 hours every day for each of them. So that for 5 there are 
20 hours. The rate of surplus value has grown by 100%; the total 
amount of surplus value or the surplus value itself is only 
4x5 = 20 hours. The surplus value is only 7s of the 100 created by 
the 50, smaller by 80%. If now 15 workers were employed at the 
new rate the amount of surplus value would rise to 60, if 20 to 
80, if 25 to 100. Half as many workers would have to be employed 
at the new rate in order to produce as much surplus value as at 
the old rate. But if 50 were employed, they would produce twice 
as much, namely 200. Not only the rate of surplus value, but also 
the surplus value itself would have doubled.// //Assume that the 
5 only produced surplus value at the same rate as the 50, hence 
only 10 hours. Then 50 workers would have to be employed just 
as before in order to produce the same surplus value, although 
they would produce 10 times as many commodities in the same 
time.  This in the branches of industry where the product does not 
enter into the consumption of the workers themselves. Here the 
profit derives purely from the fact that the necessary labour time, 
over a certain average period, stands higher than the labour time 
needed by the capitalists who have introduced the new machinery; 
they therefore sell the commodity above its value. This is, however, 
different from sheer fraud. They sell it above the value it costs 
them, and below the value it costs society before the general 
introduction of the machinery. They sell the labour of their [...]

produced in an hour, in a day — //and with the new means of pro­
duction he provides a greater total amount in the same time// 
—above their value, above the hour or the day of labour time

tion costs as the others incur in producing 5, and if he sells them

they also receive commodities for their wages (i.e. in so far as the 
more cheaply produced commodity enters into their [XVI-1010] 
consumption). And let this take place for all the workers, each of 
whom would be able to buy more of this specific commodity with the 
aliquot part of their wage which is expended for it. 
The capitalist would make a surplus profit of 3/5 or 60%. He 
sells them the commodity Vs cheaper, but he sells the labour

Let us assume that necessary labour time= 10. Thus under the 
old conditions they would obtain 10/i2 of the product 10. In the old 
situation 1 hour of labour produces V12 of the product of a day, 
hence in 10, 10/i2 =8 thalers, for example. In the new situation "V12 
is produced in one hour of labour= 4/3, l'/3- In 3 hours 4 thalers, 
in 6 hours 8 thalers. 111 Thus they work 6 hours of surplus labour. 
Previously it was only 2.11 
II Adam Smith correctly adduces in favour of an average 
profit—i.e. a profit purely determined by the magnitude of the 
capital—the example of the use of silver instead of iron, or gold 
instead of silver, of a more costly raw material in general, under 
otherwise identical conditions of production.112 Here the part of the 
capital advanced in the form of raw material may grow 
hundredfold, and more, ditto therefore the profit, with the same 
rate of average profit. Although not the slightest  CHANGE  takes place 
in the organic relations between the different components of the 
capital. // 
//The Yankee economist Wayland is very naive.113 Because 
relative surplus value is only produced in branches of industry 
directly or indirectly involved in the production of articles 
destined for the workers' consumption, hence it is there in 
particular that capital introduces cooperation, division of labour 
and machinery, and because this occurs to a much lesser extent in 
luxury production, he concludes that the capitalists work to the 
advantage of the poor, not the rich, and capital there develops its 
productivity in the interest of the former, not the latter. // 
Average surplus value—disregarding here absolute surplus 
value, and considering only relative surplus value, which arises 
from the curtailment of necessary labour time through the 
development of the productive powers of labour—is the total

amount of surplus value in all specific branches of production, 
measured against the total capital laid out for living labour. Since 
the development of productive power is very uneven in the 
different branches of industry (which directly or indirectly 
produce the means of subsistence entering into the worker's 
consumption), uneven not only in degree but often proceeding in 
opposed directions, as the productivity of labour is just as much 
[XVI-1011] bound up with natural conditions which may lead to a 
decline in productivity while the productivity of labour grows // the 
whole of the investigation into the extent to which natural 
conditions influence the productivity of labour independently of 
the development of social productivity and often in opposition to 
it, belongs imo the analysis of rent//—it results from this that this 
average surplus value must stand very much below the level to be 
expected from the development of productive power in the 
individual branches of industry (the most prominent ones). This is 
in turn one of the main reasons why the rate of surplus value, 
although it grows, does not grow in the same proportion as the 
variable capital declines in its proportion to the total capital. This 
would only be the case (assuming that the proportion is correct in 
general; it is correct for the rate of surplus value, as has been 
shown previously,2 but not for surplus value) if those branches of 
industry in which the variable C declines the most against fixed, 
etc., were to make their products enter into the consumption of 
the worker in the same proportion. But take here, for example, 
the proportion between industrial and agricultural products, 
where the relation is precisely the opposite. u 
Let us now consider a particular branch of industry. If an 
increase of productive power occurs in it, the increase which 
occurs in this particular branch absolutely does not imply a direct 
increase in the branch of industry which provides it with its raw 
material (with the exception of agriculture, since its product itself 
provides its raw material, in seeds, and this is again a peculiarity of 
agriculture). The raw material branch itself at first remains 
completely unaffected by the increase, and may also remain 
unaffected subsequently. //Nevertheless, a cheaper raw material 
does not step in to replace it, unless the same raw material becomes 
cheaper, as cotton does not replace sheep's wool. // But the 
productivity is demonstrated by the fact that a greater quantity of 
raw material is needed to absorb the same quantity of labour. 
Thus this part of constant capital at first grows unconditionally

with the greater productivity of labour. If 5 produce as much as 
50, or more, 50 will work up 10 times more raw material. The raw 
material must initially increase in the same proportion as the 
productivity of labour. Or if we assume that 5 produce as much as 
50, and 45 are dismissed, the 5 now need  10 x as much capital as 
did the 5 previously, or as much as 50. This part of the capital has 
grown 10 times, at least, measured against the capital laid out in 
labour. //With greater exploitation this can be restricted some­
what, if on the one hand there is a relative reduction in waste 
through the improved quality of the labour, and on the other 
hand because the waste is absolutely more massive, more 
concentrated, can serve better as raw material once again for new, 
different production, hence in fact the same raw material stretches 
further,  AS  TO ITS  VALUE.  This is an ITEM, but an insignificant one. // 
However, this is not to say by any means that fixed capital, 
buildings, machinery (lighting, etc.) (apart from fixed capital the 
matières instrumentales in general) increase in the same proportion, 
so that 10 times as much would now be required by the 5 as they 
required before. On the contrary. Although machinery of greater 
BULK becomes dearer absolutely, it becomes cheaper relatively. This 
is particularly true for the motive force, steam engines, etc., the 
production costs of which fall (relatively) with [the increase in] 
their horse power or other POWER. This part—hence the total 
constant capital—therefore by no means grows in proportion with 
the growth in productive power, although it does grow absolutely, 
to an insignificant degree. The total capital therefore does not 
grow [XVI-1012] proportionally in relation to the growth of 
productive power. 
If out of the 500 there were originally perhaps 300 for workers, 
150 for raw material and 50 for instruments, it follows that a 
doubling of productive power through the application of machin­
ery would require the employment of at least 300 for raw 
material, and if 50 workers produced this product of twice the 
size, 50 for labour; but it does not follow that the cost of 
machinery, etc., for these 30a workers would rise from 50 to 500, 
a tenfold increase. The cost of machinery would perhaps only rise 
to double the amount—to 100; so that the total capital would have 
fallen from 500 to 450. The ratio between the variable capital and 
the total capital would now be 30:450. 30/45o=3/45 =  7i5. 1:15. 
a Marx altered the number of workers from 50 to 30 and based his subsequent 
calculations on the latter figure.— Ed. 

=====第143页=====
General Law of the Fall in the Rate of Profit 133 
Previously the ratio was 300:500,300/5oo=3:5. 7i5=3/45; and  3/b=27/45. 
According to this, however, the total capital required to produce a 
certain surplus value would have fallen. Assume in the first case 
that the surplus value=2 hours out of 12,=2/i2, in the second 
case=4/i2 or Vs-116 
In the first case l/6 of 300 (if a worker =1 thaler) =  50. And this is 
10% of 500. 
In the second case Va of 30=10. 450 are required for the 
production of these 10. If we assume that 300 workers are 
employed at this new rate, they would produce 100. The total 
capital needed to produce the 100 would rise to 
450x30=4,500x3=13,500. In the previous ratio it was 1,000 to 
produce 100. 
But assume that fixed capital falls still more, not perhaps 
relatively in proportion to the growth of the productive forces. If 
the 30 workers produce as much as the 300 did previously, they 
will need 500, just as before: 150 for raw material, 30 for labour 
(as previously 300), but perhaps only 100 for fixed capital. The 
total capital is now 210, of which variable capital is ili\  = ^h, 
[XVI-1013] previously=3/5. (300 out of 500) 
If the surplus value were now to increase 5fold, the 30 would 
give a surplus value of 50, where the 300 gave one of 10. Thus on 
300,  30, would be on 30—15. 
The total capital is 500 in the first case, 210 in the second case. 
410 would now give 30, hence more than 500 previously. 
The growth of productive power allows more commodities to be 
produced in the same labour time. Therefore, it does not raise the 
exchange value of the commodities produced in this way, but only 
their quantity; it rather lessens the exchange value of the 
individual commodities, while the value of the total amount of 
commodities produced in a given time remains the same. 
To say that there is an increase in productivity is the same as 
saying that the same raw material absorbs less labour in the course 
of its conversion into the product, or that the same labour time 
requires more raw material for its absorption. 
For example, a pound of yarn requires exactly the same amount 
of cotton, whether a large or a small amount of labour is required 
for the conversion of the cotton into yarn. If the productivity of 
the spinner rises, the quantity of cotton contained in a pound of 
yarn absorbs less labour. The pound of yarn therefore falls in

value, gets cheaper. If 20 times as many pounds of cotton as 
before are spun in an hour, e.g. 20 pounds instead of 1 pound, 
each pound of yarn falls by V20 in the value component the labour 
of spinning adds to it; in the differential value between a pound 
of cotton and a pound of yarn (leaving aside the value of the fixed 
capital present in the spun yarn). Nevertheless, the value of the 
product of the same time is now greater than before, not because 
more new value has been created, but only because more cotton 
has been spun, and the value of this has on our assumption 
remained the same. The newly created value would be the same 
amount for the 20 pounds as previously for the one pound alone. 
For 1 pound it would in the new mode of production be smaller 
by 'AM-
Presupposing therefore that the commodities are sold at their 
value, the increase of productive power (with the exceptions 
mentioned earlier3) only creates surplus value in so far as the 
cheapening of the commodities cheapens the production costs of 
labour capacity, hence shortens the necessary labour time, hence 
lengthens surplus labour time. 
The product of every particular sphere of production can 
therefore only create surplus value in so far as, and in the 
proportion in which, this specific product enters into the average 
consumption of the workers. But every such product—since a 
developed division of labour within society is a fundamental 
prerequisite for the development of commodities in general and 
even more for capitalist production—only forms an aliquot part of 
the worker's total consumption. The increase of productive power 
in every particular sphere therefore creates a surplus value by no 
means in proportion to the increase of productive power but only in the 
much smaller proportion in which the product of this particular 
sphere forms an aliquot part of the worker's total consumption. If 
a product formed V10 of the worker's total consumption, a 
doubling of productive power would allow the production of 2/io 
in the same time as V10 was produced previously. V10 of the wage 
would fall to V20, or by 50%, while the productive power would 
have risen by 100%. 50% on l/wx  = 5% on lx. E.g. 5% on 100 
comes to 105. 50% on 10%o or 10 comes to 5, the same total 
amount. The growth of productive power by 100% would in this 
case have cheapened wages by 5%. [XVI-1014] It is therefore clear 
why the striking growth of productive power in individual 
branches of industry appears to be entirely out of proportion with 
3 See this volume, pp. 130-32.— Ed. 

=====第145页=====
General Law of the Fall in the Rate of Profit 135 
the fall of wages or the growth of relative surplus value. Hence 
capital too—to the extent that this depends on surplus value, a 
point we shall soon investigate more closely—is far from 
increasing in the same proportion as the growth in the productive 
power of labour. 
Only if productive power were to increase evenly in all branches 
of industry which directly or indirectly provide products for the 
worker's consumption could the proportional growth of surplus 
value correspond to the proportional increase of productive 
power. But this is by no means the case. Productive power 
increases in very different proportions in these different branches. 
Contrary movements often take place in these different spheres 
(this is due partly to the anarchy of competition and the specific 
nature of bourgeois production, partly to the fact that the 
productive power of labour is also tied to natural conditions, 
which often become less productive in the same proportion as 
productivity rises, in so far as it depends on social conditions) so 
that the productivity of labour rises in one sphere while it falls in 
another. //Think for example of the simple influence of the 
seasons, on which the greater part of all the raw products of 
industry depends, exhaustion of forests, coal seams, mines and the 
like. // The growth of average total productivity is therefore always 
and unconditionally much less than this growth appears in a few 
particular spheres, and indeed in one of the main branches of 
industry, the products of which enter into the worker's consump­
tion, agriculture, it is as yet FAR  FROM  KEEPING  PACE  WITH THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. On the Other 
hand, in many branches of industry the development of produc­
tive power has no influence, either directly or indirectly, on the 
production of labour capacity, hence of relative surplus value. 
Quite apart from the fact that the development of productive 
power is not only expressed in an increase in the rate of surplus 
value but also in a (relative) reduction in the number of workers. 
Hence the growth of surplus value is by no means in proportion 
to the growth of productive power in particular branches of 
production, and, secondly, it is also always smaller than the growth 
of the productive power of capital in all branches of industry 
(hence also those branches whose products enter neither directly 
nor indirectly into the production of labour capacity). Hence the 
accumulation of capital grows—not in the same proportion as 
productive power increases in a particular branch, and not even in 
the proportion in which productive power increases in all 
branches, but only in the average proportion in which it increases 
10*

136 Capital  and  Profit 
in all the  branches  of industry  of which  the  products enter 
directly  or indirectly into  the  overall consumption  of the  workers. 
The value  of a  commodity  is determined  by the  total labour time, 
past and  living, which enters into  it, which  is contained  in it;  hence 
not only  by the  labour time which  is added  in the  final production 
process, from which  the  commodity  as such emerges,  but by the 
labour contained  in the  fixed capital  and  circulating capital,  or in 
the conditions  of production  of the  labour last  to be  added,  by the 
labour time contained  in the  machinery,  etc., the  matières 
instrumentales  and the raw  material,  in so far as  their value 
reappears  in the  commodity, which  is entirely  the  case with  raw 
material  and  [XVI-1015]  the  matières instrumentales, whereas  the 
value  of the  fixed capital only reappears partially  in the 
product—in proportion to its  WEAR AND TEAR. 
If V4 of the  value  in a  commodity consisted  of constant capital 
and  SU of  wages;  if as a  result  of an  increase  of productive power 
in this particular branch  the  amount  of living labour employed 
were  to fall from  5/4 to  V4, and if the  number  of workers employed 
in its production were  to be  reduced from  3/4 to  V4, then, given  the 
presupposition that  the V4 of  labour  was  exactly  as productive  as 
the  s/4 was  previously  (and not  more  so), the  value  of the new 
fixed  and  circulating capital, apart from  the raw  material 
contained  in the V4,  could rise  to 2A.  Then  the  value  of the 
commodity would remain unchanged, although  the  labour would 
have become more productive  by iU to V4, i.e. by 3 to 1, i.e. it 
would have tripled  its productive power. Since  the  value  of the 
raw material would have remained  the  same,  the new  fixed  and 
circulating capital would  not be  able  to rise as far as 2/4 of the old 
value  of the  commodity, thus permitting  the  commodity  to become 
cheaper, with  a real fall  in its  production costs.  Or the  difference 
between  the new  labour time  and the old  would have  to be  larger 
than the  difference between  the  value  of the old  constant capital 
and the new  (deducting  the raw  material).  It is not  possible  to add 
the same amount more  of past labour  as a  condition  of labour  as 
has been deducted  of living labour.  If the V4 of  workers were  to 
produce more than  the 3/4 did  previously,  so that  the  increase  in 
the productivity  of their labour were greater than  the  reduction  in 
their numbers  or their total labour time,  the new  constant capital 
could grow  // disregarding surplus value here  and  speaking only  of 
the value  of the  commodity,  on which after  all the  surplus value 
depends, because  the  cheapening  of the  production costs  of labour 

=====第147页=====
General Law of the Fall in the Rate of Profit 137 
capacity depends on the lessening of the value// by 2/4, and even 
by more than 2/4, only it would now have to grow in the same 
proportion as the productive power of the new labour. 
Secondly, however, this relation is also brought about, 1) by the 
fact that the fixed capital only enters in part into the value of the 
commodity; 2) the matières instrumentales, such as the coal con­
sumed, the heating, lighting, etc., are proportionally economised 
by labour on a large scale, although their total value increases, and 
therefore a smaller value component of the same enters into the 
individual commodity. But the condition remains the same, that 
the value component of the machinery which enters into the 
individual commodity as  WEAR  and  TEAR,  and the matières instrumen­
tales which enter into it, should be smaller than the difference in 
productivity between the new and the old labour. Nevertheless, 
this does not exclude the possibility that an equally large or even a 
larger quantity of constant capital might be used for the total 
amount of commodities, e.g. the number of pounds of twist, which 
are produced in a given period of time, e.g. a day, than was 
previously expended in the form of wages. Only a smaller quantity 
in respect of the individual commodity. Presupposing, therefore, 
that the 1/in workers produce exactly as much in one day as the 
^Un workers produced previously, the law would remain absolute. 
Because the amount of commodities produced would remain the 
same in proportion to these xUn workers as it was for the 3/4n 
workers. The value of the individual commodity could therefore 
fall only if the new constant capital < than that previously 
expended in wages and now no longer in existence. It can 
therefore be said absolutely that in the proportion in which a 
smaller quantity of labour replaces a greater quantity of labour—[XVI-
1016] does not need to be identical, but may be, and mostly is, 
greater than the proportion in which the number of workers is 
diminished (the relative number of workers)—the constant capital 
which enters into the commodity //and in practice also the interest 
and profit on the whole of the constant capital, which admittedly 
enters into the labour process but not into the valorisation 
process// must be greater than the proportion in which the new 
constant capital grows (here the raw material is left out). This is 
only an aspect to be introduced in distinction to the one-sided 
consideration in dealing with surplus value. To be inserted in the 
section on production costs.3 
This does not, however, (owing to the way in which the fixed 
capital is reproduced) prevent the total capital //hence also the 
a See this volume, pp. 78-103.— Ed. 

=====第148页=====
138 Capital and Profit 
part of it which is not consumed in the labour process, but still 
enters into it// from being absolutely greater than the previous 
total capital. 
Thus if e.g. 1 replaces 10, the capital which is allotted to him in 
the form of machinery, etc., and matières instrumentales —in so far 
as it enters into his product—is smaller than the previous capital 
which was required for the 10 workers. The proportion of capital 
laid out in labour has fallen 10 times here, but the new constant 
capital has perhaps only risen 8 times. From this point of view, 
therefore, the capital laid out in labour has not fallen proportion­
ally in the same degree as the capital required for its realisation 
[has increased]. Or the total amount of capital which enters into 
the production of the one worker is smaller than the total amount 
of capital which enters into the production of the 10 workers 
replaced by him. And, although the part of capital laid out in 
wages has fallen 10 times in comparison with previously, it still 
forms a larger part of this new capital than Vio> because this new 
capital, which enters into the production of the one worker, has 
itself become smaller than the old capital, which entered into the 
production of the 20 workers. 
On the other hand, however, the total capital which is required 
as condition of production for this increase in the productivity of 
labour—including namely the part which does not enter as WEAR 
and TEAR into the product—but is rather consumed in a series of 
work periods—is greater—may be much greater than the 
previous total capital, so that the part of the total capital laid out 
in labour has declined in a still greater proportion than the 
productivity of labour has grown. The more the fixed capital 
develops, i.e. the productivity of labour, the greater this uncon-
sumed part of the capital, the smaller the proportion of the part 
of capital laid out in labour in relation to the total capital. From 
this point of view it might appear as if the magnitude of the 
capital grew more rapidly than the productivity of labour //but 
even the total capital cannot grow to the extent that the interest 
and profit on it raise the production costs of the commodity to the 
level to which the productivity of labour has risen//. But this only 
means that the portion of the capital annually produced which is 
converted into fixed capital is always increased relatively to the 
portion of the capital which is laid out in wages; by no means, 
however, that the total capital—which is in part fixed, in part 
converted into wages—grows as quickly as the productivity of 
labour. 
If the part of capital laid out in labour thus falls, this is even 

=====第149页=====
General Law of the Fall in the Rate of Profit 139 
more the case if the growth in the part of capital which consists of 
raw material is brought into consideration at the same time. 
[XVI-1017] Let us take an extreme case: the rearing of sheep on 
a modern scale, where previously small-scale agriculture predomi­
nated. But here two different branches of industry are being 
compared. The amount of labour—or of capital laid out in 
wages—which is suppressed here is enormous. Hence the constant 
capital can also grow enormously. And it is very much the 
question whether the total capital which is here allotted to the 
individual shepherds is greater than the total amount of the 
capitals which were previously divided among several hundred 
shepherds. 
It is questionable whether, in individual branches of industry in 
which the total capital undergoes extraordinary growth, profit 
originates at all from the surplus value produced in these branches 
and not rather, in connection with the calculations made by the 
capitalists between themselves, from the general surplus value 
produced by the sum total of all the capitals. 
Many ways of increasing productive power, particularly with the 
employment of machinery, require absolutely no relative increase 
in capital outlay. Often only relatively inexpensive alterations in 
the part of the machine which provides the motive force, etc. See 
examples.117 Here the increase in productive power is unusually 
great compared to the capital outlay which falls to the relative 
share of the individual worker—of the individual commodity as 
well. Thus here—at least as far as this part of the capital is 
concerned—the capital laid out in raw material grows the more 
rapidly—no noticeable reduction in the rate of profit—at least not 
to the extent that it would be caused by an increase in this part of 
the capital. On the other hand, although the capital does not grow 
here so much relatively speaking, it is true to say, as it is in the 
general case overall, that for the most part the absolute amount of 
capital employed—hence the concentration of capital or the scale 
on which work is done—must grow very significantly. More 
powerful steam engines (of more horsepower) are absolutely 
dearer than less powerful ones. But relatively speaking their price 
falls.  Even so, a greater outlay of capital—a greater concentration 
of capital in one hand—is required for their employment. A 
bigger factory building is absolutely dearer, but relatively cheaper, 
than a smaller one. If every aliquot part of the total capital is 
smaller in proportion to the total capital employed by the labour

saved, this aliquot part can mostly be employed solely in such 
MULTIPLES as will raise the total amount of capital employed to an 
extraordinary degree or in particular the part of the total capital 
not consumed in a single turnover, the part the consumption of 
which extends over a period of turnovers lasting many years. It is 
in general only with this work on a large scale that productive 
power is increased tremendously, since it is only in this way that: 
1) the principle of MULTIPLES, which underlies simple cooperation, 
and is repeated in the division of labour and the employment of 
machinery, can correctly be applied. (See Babbage, on how this 
increases the scale of production, i.e. the concentration of capital.3) 
2) The greater altogether the number of workers employed on 
the new scale, the smaller, relatively, the portion of fixed capital 
which enters as  WEAR  and  TEAR  for buildings, etc. The greater the 
principle of the cheapening of production costs by joint utilisation 
of the same use values, as lighting, heating, common use of the 
motive power, etc. [XVI-1018] The more is it possible to employ 
absolutely dearer, but relatively cheaper, instruments of produc­
tion. 
The circumstance that in some branches of production, railways, 
canals, etc., where an immense fixed capital is employed, these are 
not independent sources of surplus value, because the ratio 
between the labour exploited and the capital laid out is too small. 
A further remark needs to be added to the previous page : 
It is possible that if a capital of 500 was needed for 20 workers, 
and now a total capital of only 400 is needed for 2, 2,000 workers 
will now have to be employed, hence a capital of 400,000, in order 
to employ the aliquot parts of the 400 productively. It has already 
been shownc that even with an increased rate of surplus value the 
relative reduction in the number of workers to be exploited can 
only be counterbalanced by a very great increase in the multiple of 
labour. 
This is seen (appears) in competition. Once the new invention 
has been introduced generally, the rate of profit becomes too 
small for a small capital to be able to continue to operate in the

given branch of industry. The amount of necessary conditions of 
production grows in general in such a way that a significant 
minimum level comes into existence, which excludes all the smaller 
capitals from this branch of production for the future. It is only at 
the beginning that small capitals can exploit mechanical inventions 
in every sphere of production. 
The growth of capital only implies a reduction in the rate of 
profit to the extent that with the growth of capital the 
above-mentioned changes take place in the ratio between its 
organic components. However, despite the constant daily changes 
in the mode of production, capital, or a large part of it, always 
continues to accumulate over a longer or shorter period on the 
basis of a definite average ratio between those organic compo­
nents,  SO that NO ORGANIC CHANGE OCCUrS IN ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS aS it 
grows. 
On the other hand, a reduction in the rate of profit can only be 
enforced by a growth in capital—because of a growth in the absolute 
amount of profit—as long as the rate of profit does not fall in the 
same proportion as the capital grows. The obstacles which stand in 
the way of this are to be found in the considerations we have 
already brought forward.3 
Absolute plethora of capital. 
Increase in workers, etc., despite the relative decline in variable 
capital or capital laid out in wages. However, this does not take 
place in all spheres of production [XVI-1019]. E.g. not in 
agriculture. Here the decline in the element of living labour is 
absolute. 
An increase in the amount of labour on the new production 
basis is in part necessary in order to compensate for the lessened 
rate of profit by means of the amount of profit; in part in order 
to compensate for the fall in the magnitude of surplus value which 
accompanies the rising rate of surplus value on account of the 
absolute reduction in the number of workers exploited by means 
of an increase in the number of workers on the new scale. Finally 
the principle of  MULTIPLES  touched on earlier.

142 Capital and Profit 
But it will be said that if the variable capital declines in sphere 
of production I, it increases in the others, namely those which are 
employed in the production of the constant capital needed for 
sphere of production I. Nevertheless, the same relation enters 
here,  e.g. in the production of machinery, in the production of 
raw products, matières instrumentales, e.g. coal. The tendency is 
general, although it is first realised in the different spheres of 
production by fits and starts. It is counterbalanced by the fact that 
the spheres of production themselves increase. In any case, it is 
only a need of the bourgeois economy that the number of people 
living from their labour alone should increase absolutely, even if it 
declines relatively. Since labour capacities become superfluous for 
the bourgeois economy once it is no longer necessary to exploit 
them for 12 to 15 hours a day. A development of productive 
power which reduced the absolute number of workers, i.e. in fact 
enabled the whole nation to execute its total production in a 
smaller period of time, would bring about revolution, because it 
would demonetise the majority of the population. Here there 
appears once again the limit of bourgeois production, and the fact 
becomes obvious that it is not the absolute form for the 
development of productive power, that it rather enters into 
collision with the latter at a certain point. In part this collision 
appears constantly, with the crises, etc., which occur when now 
one now another component of the working class becomes 
superfluous in its old mode of employment. Its limit is the surplus 
time of the workers; it is not concerned with the absolute surplus 
time gained by society. The development of productive power is 
therefore only important in so far as it increases the surplus 
labour time of the workers, not in so far as it reduces labour time 
for material production in general. It is therefore embedded in a 
contradiction. 
The rate of surplus value—i.e. the ratio of surplus to necessary 
labour time for the individual worker (therefore in so far as 
surplus value is not modified in the different spheres of 
production by the proportion between the organic components of 
capital, turnover time, etc.)—is automatically balanced out in all 
the spheres of production, and this is a basis for the general rate of 
profit. (The modifications which in this way influence the necessary 
costs of production are compensated for by the competition 
between capitalists, by the different ITEMS which they bring into 
consideration when dividing among themselves the general surplus 
value.) 

=====第153页=====
I 
General Law of the Fall in the Rate of Profit 143 
[XVI-1020] That the rate of surplus value rises means nothing 
other than that the cost of production of labour capacity falls, 
hence necessary labour time falls, in the proportion to which the 
specific product of that particular sphere of production which has 
become cheaper enters into the general consumption of the 
workers. This cheapening of labour capacity, reduction in 
necessary labour time, increase in absolute labour time, therefore 
takes place uniformly, and influences all spheres of capitalist 
production uniformly, not only those in which the development of 
productive power has taken place, but also those whose products 
do not enter at all into the consumption of the workers, and in 
which the development of productive power can therefore create 
no relative surplus value. (It is therefore clear that in competition, 
once the monopoly in the new invention has come to an end, the 
price of the product is reduced to its production costs.) 
If, therefore, 20 workers who work 2 hours of surplus labour 
are replaced by 2, it is correct, as we have seen already," that these 
2 can under no circumstances provide as much surplus labour as 
the 20 did previously. But in all spheres of production the surplus 
labour rises in proportion to the cheapening of the product of the 
2 workers, and it rises without any alteration having taken place in 
the ratio of the organic components of the capitals employed by 
the spheres of production. 
On the other hand, an increase in the value of the product of a 
sphere of production of this kind, which enters into the 
reproduction of labour capacity, has just as general an effect; this 
may wholly or partially paralyse that surplus value. 
In the first case, however, the surplus labour time gained is not 
to be estimated by the sphere of production in which the increase 
of productive power has taken place, but by the sum total of the 
diminutions of necessary labour time in all spheres of capitalist 
production. 
But the more general the relation becomes, with 2 replacing 20 
in all or most spheres of production, under the same proportions 
between total capital and variable capital, the more does the 
relation in the totality of capitalist production raise the relation in 
the particular spheres of production. I.e. no reduction in 
necessary labour time could create the amount of surplus value 
there was previously, when 20 worked instead of 2.

144 Capital and Profit 
And under all circumstances the rate of profit would then fall, 
even if the capital itself increased so much that a number [of 
workers] equally great or even greater than before could be 
employed under the new conditions of production. 
The accumulation of capital (considered materially) is double. It 
consists on the one hand in the growing amount of past labour, or 
the available amount of the conditions of labour; the material 
prerequisites, the already available products and numbers of 
workers, under which new production or reproduction takes place. 
Secondly, however, in the concentration, the reduction in the 
number of capitals, the growth of the capitals present in the hands 
of the individual capitalist, in short in a new distribution of 
capitals, of social capital. The power of capital as such grows 
thereby. The independent position achieved by the social condi­
tions of production [XVI-1021] vis-à-vis the real creators of those 
conditions of production, as represented in the capitalist, thereby 
becomes increasingly apparent. Capital shows itself more and 
more as a social power (the capitalist is merely its functionary, and 
it no longer stands in any relation to what the labour of an 
individual creates or can create), but an alienated social power which 
has become independent, and confronts society as a thing—and 
through this thing as a power of the individual capitalist. On the 
other hand, constantly increasing masses [of people] are thereby 
deprived of the conditions of production and find them set over 
against them. The contradiction between the general social power 
which capital is formed into, and the private power of the individual 
capitalist over these social conditions of production becomes ever 
more glaring, and implies the dissolution of this relation, since it 
implies at the same time the development of the material 
conditions of production into general, therefore communal social 
conditions of production. 
This development is given by the development of productive 
power along with capitalist production and by the manner in 
which this development of productive power takes shape. 
The question now is, how is the accumulation of capital affected 
by the development of the productive forces, in so far as they find 
expression in CHANGE[S] in surplus value and the rate of profit, and 
how far is it influenced by other factors? 
Ricardo says a that capital can grow in two ways: 1) in that a

greater amount of labour is contained in the greater amount of 
products, hence the exchange value of the use values grows along 
with their quantity; 2) in that the quantity of use values grows, but 
not their exchange value, hence the increase occurs simply 
through an increase in the productivity of labour.120

[MISCELLANEA] 
[XVII-1022] LABOUR PROCESS AND VALORISATION PROCESS: 
USE VALUE AND EXCHANGE VALUE 
It was shown originally121 that the distinction between the labour 
process and the valorisation process was of decisive importance, 
because there rested upon it the distinction between constant and 
variable capital, and the whole of the theory of capital (surplus 
value, profit, etc.). 
But there are, as will appear, yet more very important relations 
relevant to this distinction. 
We see, firstly, with fixed capital, that it enters into the labour 
process completely, but into the valorisation process only partial­
ly—to the extent that it is used up, as  WEAR  AND  TEAR.  This is one of 
the main factors working towards the cheapening of commodities 
through the employment of machinery; thus TO A CERTAIN DEGREE 
towards the increase of relative surplus value. At the same time, 
however, it is a cause of the decline in the rate of profit. 
But, apart from fixed capital, all those productive forces which 
cost nothing, i.e. those which derive from the division of labour, 
cooperation, machinery (in so far as this costs nothing, as is for 
example the case with the motive forces of water, wind, etc., and 
also with the  ADVANTAGES  which proceed from the  SOCIAL  ARRANGEMENT 
of the workshop) as well as forces of nature whose application 
does not give rise to any costs—or at least to the degree to which 
their application does not give rise to any costs—enter into the 
labour process without entering into the valorisation process. 
It is apparent here, secondly, and once again, how use value, 
which originally appears to us only as the material substratum of 
the economic relations, itself intervenes to determine the economic 
category. 

=====第157页=====
Miscellanea 147 
We saw this first with money, where the nature of the 
substratum which serves as its vehicle, the use value of the 
commodity which functions as money, is itself determined by the 
economic function. 
Secondly: the whole relation of wages to capital rests on the fact 
that labour capacity as exchange value is determined by the labour 
time required to produce it; but because its use value itself consists 
in labour, its exchange value is paid for, and it nevertheless 
returns in the exchange with capital more exchange value than it 
receives. 
[XVII-1023] 3) Fixed capital—hence this particular economic 
form—is to a large extent dependent on use value. The duration 
of the depreciation of the machine, i.e.  TO WHAT  DEGREE  it enters into 
the price of the commodity during a given period of turnover, 
and how long the component of capital represented by it 
circulates, depends on the use value, i.e. on the greater or lesser 
durability of the machine, etc. The turnover time of the total 
capital therefore depends on this; and  CHANGES  in the ratio between 
the organic components of the capital are also considerably 
affected by this. 
4) The whole distinction between the labour process and the 
valorisation process—hence also the increase in the productivity of 
labour while labour time remains the same—the whole of the 
development of the productive forces—concerns use value, not 
exchange value. But it changes and modifies the economic 
relations and exchange value relations themselves. 
DIMINUTION IN THE RATE OF PROFIT 
No capitalist voluntarily employs a new mode of production, 
even though it may be much more productive, and however high 
the ratio in which it increases the rate of surplus value, if it 
reduces the rate of profit. But every new mode of production of 
this kind cheapens the commodity. He therefore starts by selling it 
above its costs of production, and above its value. He is able to do 
this because the average labour time socially required for the 
production of this commodity is greater than the labour time 
required under the new mode of production (the total amount of 
labour time contained in the constant and variable capital). His 
mode of production stands above the socially average level. 

=====第158页=====
148 Capital and Profit 
Competition generalises this and subjects it to the general law. 
Then the fall in the rate of profit takes place, a law which is 
therefore completely independent of the will of the capitalist. 
CONSTANT CAPITAL. ABSOLUTE QUANTITY OF CAPITAL 
In order to employ with advantage the machine which produces 
the motive force (hence e.g. to use the steam engine instead of the 
motive force provided by hands and feet), which sets in motion 
the actual working machines, i.e. in such a way that the 
[XVII-1024] total capital which is required in the new mode of 
production does not make the commodity more expensive instead 
of cheapening it, it is necessary for this motivating machine to be 
employed for a large number of working machines and therefore 
relatively [fewer] workers. And relative costs of production fall in 
proportion as the number of working machines increases. Hence 
the constant growth in absolute capital and the growth in the 
minimum amount of capital required in order to employ in the 
production of the commodity no more labour time than is socially 
necessary. Hence in turn a growth [in the constant capital] (since 
the raw material and the matières instrumentales form part of this), 
a fall in the variable capital in comparison with the quantity of 
capital advanced, and, above all, the necessity for an absolutely 
large] quantity of capital. 
DECLINE IN THE RATE OF PROFIT 
The result of the investigation is this: Firstly, the rate of surplus 
value does not rise in proportion to the growth in productive 
power or the decline in the (relative) number of workers 
employed. The capital does not grow in the same proportion as 
the productive power. Or, the rate of surplus value does not rise 
in the same proportion as the variable capital falls in comparison 
with the total amount of capital. Hence a diminution in the 
relative magnitude of the surplus value. Hence a decline in the rate 
of profit. A constant tendency towards a decline in the same. 
It should be remarked further on this point that the law 
whereby the value of the commodities is determined by the labour 
time socially necessary for their production drives the individual 

=====第159页=====
Miscellanea 149 
capitalist, so that he can sell his commodity above its social value, 
to curtail the labour time necessary for him exceptionally by 
introducing the division of labour, by employing machinery, 
etc.—also in spheres of production whose products enter neither 
directly nor indirectly into the worker's consumption or into the 
conditions of production of his articles of consumption—therefore 
also in branches of production where no development of 
productive power can cheapen the reproduction of labour 
capacity, i.e. shorten the necessary labour time and lengthen the 
surplus labour time. Once proof has actually been provided that 
these commodities can be produced more cheaply, the capitalists 
who work under the old conditions of production must sell them 
below the value, since the labour time they need for the 
production of those commodities now stands above the labour time 
socially necessary for their production. In a word—and this 
appears as an effect of competition—they too must adopt the new 
mode of production [XVII-1025], in which the ratio of the 
variable capital to the total amount of capital advanced has fallen. 
Here, therefore, there takes place a reduction in the value of the 
commodities, and a reduction in the number of workers exploited, 
without an increase of any kind in relative surplus value. This 
situation in the unproductive spheres of production—those not 
producing relative surplus value—is of substantial influence, if 
one considers the capital of the whole society, i.e. of the capitalist 
class,  from the angle that the total amount of surplus value falls in 
proportion to the capital advanced—hence that the rate of profit 
falls. 
It is possible that such commodities may by growing cheaper 
become accessible to the workers' consumption, may indeed 
become necessary elements in this. Their effect is never direct, 
and is never more than partial. They  DIVERSIFY  its magnitude without 
raising its value. Above all, they DIVERSIFY the magnitude of the 
capitalists' [consumption], a point which can be made for any 
development in productivity, but which is irrelevant in our context. 
They even exert an economic influence, in so far as every expansion 
of the sphere of exchange, every magnification of the number of 
stages in which the exchange value of a commodity unfolds promotes 
at the same time its character as commodity, hence also promotes the 
mode of production directed exclusively at the production of 
commodities, not of use values as such. 
On the other hand, the fall in variable capital in comparison 
with total capital—and this fall accompanies every development of 
productive power—does not occur to the same degree as 
11-613 

=====第160页=====
150 Capital and Profit 
productive power develops, because an ever more considerable 
portion of the capital enters into the value of the commodities, 
into the valorisation process, only in the form of annuities, and 
because during certain periods a constant increase takes place in 
the size of the capital in the production of a particular commodity 
without accompanying changes in the ratio of the organic 
components, i.e. it remains on the basis of the old mode of 
production. The rate of profit therefore does not diminish in the 
same proportion as capital grows (still less in a greater propor­
tion),  although the growth of capital—to the extent that it 
depends on the development of the productive forces—is 
continuously accompanied by a tendential fall in the rate of 
profit. 
We therefore say, on the one hand: capital does not grow as 
quickly as productive power. We say, on the other hand: the rate 
of profit does not fall as quickly as capital grows. We say, on the 
one hand: variable capital does not decline as quickly in 
proportion to total capital, or total capital does not grow as quickly 
in proportion to variable capital, as productivity grows. We say, on 
the other hand: the surplus value created by variable capital does 
not grow as quickly as the variable capital falls, and does not fall as 
quickly as the constant capital rises. (Of the total capital.) 
[XVII-1026] The absolute magnitude of surplus value declines, 
in comparison with the capital advanced, although the rate of 
surplus value rises, with the fall in variable capital, or in the 
relative portion of the total capital which is laid out in wages. But 
it declines more slowly than variable capital falls. The rate of 
profit therefore does not fall as quickly as the total capital grows. 
On the other hand, the total capital does not grow as quickly as 
productive power and the replacement of variable capital by 
constant capital which accompanies this. This would therefore 
imply that variable capital falls more quickly than the total capital 
grows. But this is incorrect, in so far as the total capital enters into 
the valorisation process. However, the more rapid growth in the 
productive power of capital means only that the growth in the rate 
of surplus value does not correspond to the growth in productive 
power. 
In so far as the employment of a greater amount of constant 
capital really creates [greater] surplus value, the aliquot part of the 
total amount of capital which corresponds to a single worker must 
be smaller than the total amount of capital which corresponded to 
the number of workers he replaces. But this comparative 
reduction in the aliquot parts of the capital relative to the 

=====第161页=====
Miscellanea 151 
individual workers employed by it (absolutely greater in relation to 
this individual, smaller in relation to the number he replaces) 
generally occurs—and in the further course of development 
always occurs—with a simultaneous increase in the absolute size of 
the capital, hence of the sum total of these aliquot parts. If, e.g., a 
capital of 400 was used for one instead of 500 for 20, these 400 
could perhaps only be employed in this manner if 10,000x400 
were employed. Therefore, although the conditions of labour 
would be cheaper for the individual worker—not compared with 
the previous individual worker, but with the previous 20 work­
ers—there is a rise in the total value of the conditions of labour 
which must be possessed by the individual so as to carry on the 
productive labour process under these new conditions. I.e. the 
power of capital vis-à-vis labour grows, or, and this is the same 
thing, the worker's chance of appropriating the conditions of 
labour for himself is lessened. The independent position of past 
labour as an alien power over living labour achieves a tremendous 
extension of its dimensions. The good Carey overlooked this. 122 
The single spindle is cheaper, but the workshop needed to employ 
mechanical spindles of this kind requires a capital extraordinarily 
increased in size, compared with that required previously by the 
hand spinner. 
At the start of developments in many spheres of production 
where the tool is transformed into a machine of labour—but has 
not yet developed into a system of machinery—there may indeed 
be a fall in the amount of capital required, if e.g. 1 worker 
replaces 10, the raw material remains the same, and the cost of the 
machine-like tool is in contrast less than the wages of the 
10 workers over one year. Mr. Carey TAKES HOLD  OF such phenome­
na of the transition from manual to machine labour TO  MAKE  A FOOL 
OF HIMSELF.  But these small machines are then seized upon by capital, 
which applies to them the principles of cooperation and the 
division of labour, and the principle of the [XVII-1027] 
proportional reduction of production costs, and finally subjects the 
whole workshop to a motivating machine or a natural force. 
ACCUMULATION '" 
The most direct way in which the increase in productive power 
intensifies the accumulation of capital is through the reduction in 
necessary labour time and the increase in surplus value, since 
il* 

=====第162页=====
152 Capital and Profit 
surplus value is converted from its form as income into the form 
of capital; this conversion in general constitutes accumulation. 
The direct result of every increase in productive power is a 
cheapening of the commodities in whose sphere of production the 
heightening of productive power has taken place. Whether these 
commodities enter into the worker's means of subsistence — hence 
into the reproduction of labour capacity — or not, they increase in 
any case the amount of use values in which a definite magnitude of 
value is represented, hence a definite sum of money //the value of 
the substance in which the money exists remaining unchanged//, 
or the amount of use values representing a specific quantity of 
labour time — even where these commodities do not increase the 
magnitude of the surplus value, and the magnitude of the profit 
(its value magnitude). A relatively greater part of the income — of 
the profit, the surplus value — can therefore be reconverted into 
capital, although the extent of the capitalist's enjoyments, or the 
amount of use values he consumes, values not reconverted into 
capital, is simultaneously increased. The more so, in that the 
increase of productive forces also takes place in the spheres of 
luxury production, and here luxury production is to be under­
stood as including all production which does not enter either 
directly or indirectly into the reproduction of labour capacity. The 
accumulation of capital therefore grows as productive power 
increases, not only through the growth in the magnitude of the 
value which is represented in the form of profit, but through the 
ability, resulting from the general cheapening of commodities, to 
reconvert into capital an increasingly large part of income. 
Disregarding this point: In so far as the increase in the 
productive power of the raw material and the instruments of 
labour, of the constant capital, brings about luxury production in 
the above sense, the same total capital absorbs more labour 
altogether, can employ, can realise, more labour. This is another 
source of the accumulation of capital, since here the absolute, if 
not the relative, surplus value is increased, because more days of 
labour are employed, exploited. 
[XVII-1028] DIMINUTION OF OUTGOINGS 
FOR CONSTANT CAPITAL 
The  SUPPRESSION  of all precautionary measures aimed at the safety, 
convenience and health of the workers belongs here; e.g. in the 
coal mines, similarly in the factories proper, a large part of the 

=====第163页=====
Miscellanea 153 
battle bulletins (see the half-yearly factory REPORTS) of the wounded 
and dead of the industrial armies arises from this source.124 
Similarly lack of space, etc. 
The devaluation of constant capital as a result of new inventions, 
whereby it can be reproduced more cheaply and with better 
quality, more effectively, hence the labour time contained in it is 
no longer that socially necessary — and improvements come thick 
and fast particularly when new machines are first introduced — is 
one of the main reasons why overwork and the prolongation of 
SURPLUS labour time — OVERTIME—goes hand in hand with machinery 
(see the examples in Babbage125 ). The circulation time within 
which the value of machines, etc., and other components of fixed 
capital is reproduced is in practice not determined by the time 
during which they last but by the quantity of labour time during 
which they serve as means of production, and in general by the 
dimensions, the duration, of the labour process during which they 
function and are used up. If the  WORKMEN  work 18 hours instead of 
12, this gives 3 more days per week, l'/ä weeks of labour in 1 
week, hence in 52 weeks 52+ 52/2=52+26=78 weeks. In 5 years 
390 weeks, hence well-nigh 7 years. If the  OVERTIME  is unpaid, and 
the normal  SURPLUS  TIME=2 hours, 30 hours of the 3 days (36 hours) 
would have to be paid for. Apart from the normal surplus time, 
the workers thus provide 1 week free for every 2 weeks. 1 year for 
every 2. And thus the valorisation of the machine is  doubled,  and 
accomplished in half the time needed otherwise.126 
Where the capitalists have a monopoly, and are not compelled 
by competition to replace obsolete machinery, etc., by new, as for 
example on the railways, they therefore exclude improvements as 
long as possible. "The Lancet" for 1 March 1862  STATES  that a large 
number of the illnesses arising from railway travel are caused by 
the lack of elasticity inside the carriages and in the springs which 
SUPPORT the carriages. 
* "The inventor of any patented article usually obtains reward for his ingenuity 
by a royalty on the sale from persons making use of his discovery. A number of 
ingenious improvements adapted solely for use by railway companies are yearly 
patented, and the system pursued towards the inventors is that, after approval of 
the plan suggested, it is determined to wait until the time of the patent expires 
before adopting it. Thus the old stock is used up and the royalty to the patentee 
saved; and though a few more preventable accidents may occur, yet the public are 
supposed to be used to being so treated, and the only anxiety is to keep the reports 
out of the papers, or to soften them as much as possible."*3

CONTINUATION  OF  NOTEBOOK  XV 
Thus mercantile capital enters into  the  equalisation  of  surplus 
value  to form  an  average profit (although  it does  not  enter into 
the production  of that surplus value),  and  therefore  the  AVERAGE  RATE 
OF PROFIT  already contains  the  deduction from surplus value which 
falls to  MERCANTILE  capital, hence the  MERCANTILE  DEDUCTION  from the 
profit  of  productive capital.

If the  mercantile capital enters here into  the  distribution  of the 
surplus value,  the  rate  of  profit= 12'/2%-  If it  does  not, the 
rate=142/7%.  The  mercantile capital  of 100  must turn over  8 times 
in order  to buy and  sell 800 (for the  value  of the  commodity=700 
(cost price)+100 profit=800).  And  therefore,  in order that  it may 
also come  to  14/7%,  it must  in  every turnover give rise  to an 
eighth  of  142/7;  or  H-3/4+1/28=  l + "/i4%.  The 800  would lose 
14z/7.  There would therefore remain 785 bln.  And  the  real profit 
made  by the  capital  of 700  would = 855/7=12  12/49-  Less than  if the 
mercantile capital enters into  the  distribution. Because  in fact the 
mercantile capital would make 142/7%, whereas  the  others would

be reduced  to a quota which emerges  if '/s of the  capital makes 
l42/7%. In  fact, however,  if a  mercantile capital  of 100  is necessary 
to turn over  781 V2  (at 12  i/?%),  a larger  MERCANTILE CAPITAL  would  be 
necessary  to turn over  800. 102  ,74/i,r,63 would  be  necessary. More 
industrial capital would have  to be  converted into mercantile 
capital.  The  amount  of surplus value would thereby  be  lessened, 
hence  the  rate  of profit;  but the  mercantile rate  of profit would 
always remain somewhat higher than  the  industrial rate. 
If the  CALICO  man  has  realised  in the  £1,000  for  which  he  sells 
the 12,000 yards  the  whole production process  of the  12,000,  it 
initially appears  to be no  concern  of his if the  MERCHANT  adds  e.g. 
10% to the  price.  But,  first, once  he buys yarn, machine, coal,  etc., 
he has for his  part  to pay for the  addition  to the  price.  If the 
calico enters into  the  worker's consumption,  his  wages rise.  In both 
cases  the  calico man's rate  of profit falls.  If his  product enters into 
the constant capital  of another capital, this  is the  same thing  for 
the equalisation  of the  rate  of profit  as if it  entered into  his  own. 
Furthermore,  the  nominal increase  in the  rate  of profit brings 
with it an  uncompensated increase  in the  rate  of interest.  If the 
product enters into  the  consumption  of the  non-worker,  his 
capacity  for  accumulation,  etc., is  reduced. 
[XVII-1030]  But  this  way of  conceiving  the  matter  is wholly 
incorrect. 
Firstly,  it contradicts  the  historical  FACT  that mercantile capital,  so 
FAR FROM BEING EXCLUDED  OF  PARTICIPATING  IN  THE  REGULATION  OF  THE  AVERAGE 
PROFIT,  rather, as the first free form of capital, is the  FIRST  to ENTER 
INTO  THAT CREATION.  Mercantile profit originally determines the profit 
of PRODUCTIVE CAPITAL.  Only when capitalist production  has  pene­
trated fully, and the producer is A  MERE MERCHANT,  is the  MERCANTILE 
PROFIT  REDUCED  TO THE  ALIQUOT  PART  OF THE  SURPLUS VALUE FALLING DUE  TO IT IN 
REGARD  TO THE  ALIQUOT  PART  IT FORMS  OF THE  GENERAL CAPITAL. 
Secondly, it altogether contradicts the concept of a  GENERAL  RATE  OF 
PROFIT,  which  is entirely indifferent towards  the  particular function 
of the capital  WHICH  PARTICIPATES  IN THE  PARTITION  OF THE  GENERAL  MASS  OF 
SURPLUS  VALUE,  and is indifferent towards THE  DEGREE  IN WHICH  IT 
CONCURRED  IN ITS PRODUCTION. 
It can  therefore  be  seen that even  MERCANTILE CAPITAL,  once  it 
appears  as a  mere element  of capitalist production,  is subsumed 
under  it,  does  not  contradict  the law  that  the sum  total  of the 
AVERAGE  PRICES  of the commodities, i.e. the sum of their production 
prices,=the  sum of  their values,  and the sum of the  profits  (INTEREST 
and  RENT  INCLUDED)=the  sum of the surplus value or the unpaid 
SURPLUS  labour.  It is  only that  the  mercantile capital shares  the 

=====第166页=====
156 Capital  and Profit 
profit with the PRODUCTIVE capital, while the latter directly winkles it 
out of the worker in the form of surplus value. 
The magnitude of the deduction profit suffers through MERCAN­
TILE profit—i.e. the magnitude of the difference between the 
BUYING  PRICE  of the MERCHANT (the SELLING  PRICE  of the PRODUCER) and the 
SELLING PRICE of the MERCHANT (the BUYING PRICE of the CONSUMER), hence 
the apparent "extra charge" the merchant makes upon the price 
of the individual commodity—is determined, since the general 
rate of profit is already given, by the  AVERAGE  NUMBER  OF turnovers, 
REVOLUTIONS  of MERCANTILE CAPITAL, which is in turn expressed in the 
proportion in which the  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL  stands to the total capital. 
For e.g. 100 to realise a profit of 20%, the merchant must add 5% 
to each sum of commodities of a price of £100 if his capital 
revolves 4 times, 4% if it revolves 5 times, 2% if it revolves 10 
times.  The difference between the  BUYING  PRICE  and the  SELLING  PRICE 
of the MERCHANT is the smaller, the greater the proportion of the 
part of capital directly employed in production. 
There now remains the question: Since the MERCHANT himself may 
employ labour, apart from his capital //to the extent that his own 
labour enters here, it forms a part of  WAGES,  as with industrial 
capital //, does he create surplus value through this labour? Does it 
originate directly as a part of the profit he CHARGES on account of 
the function of his own capital? What is his relation to his own 
wage labourers (commis, 3 etc.)? 
Just as productive capital makes a profit by selling labour, 
contained in the commodity, which it has not paid for, so does 
mercantile capital do the same by paying productive capital not the 
whole of the unpaid labour contained in the commodity (in the 
commodity as product of that capital as an aliquot part of the total 
capital), but only a part of it, [and pocketing] the unpaid part 
which is still, for mercantile capital, contained within the 
commodity.128 Just as [profit] appears to industrial capital as an 
extra, a supplement to the cost, the part of the value it has not 
laid out in production, not advanced, so for commercial capital 
does the purchase price of the commodity, and the supplement to 
the price, the difference between SELLING and  BUYING  PRICE,  appear as 
something independent of the production process and the value of 
the commodity  itself,  although it is moderate in degree and is kept 
within bounds by the laws of competition. 
If we therefore take the last price—the MERCANTILE  PRICE—as 
distinct from the factory price, it is only in the former that the 
a Shop  assistants.—  Ed. 

=====第167页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital (Notebook XV) 157 
production price of the commodity is completely expressed. 
The merchant [sells] — if we leave aside the intermediate 
transactions within the merchant estate  itself,  which are of no 
interest at all here—1) to the industrial consumer, i.e. to 
productive capital. Here the mercantile profit enters as a cost into 
production. 2) He sells to the individual consumers; to the extent 
that he is himself one of these, this must be regarded as the direct 
appropriation of a part of his profit sub specie use value; 
[XVII-1031] what he himself consumes in this way is a deduction 
from the amount of the commodity in which the total surplus 
value is realised; when he sells to the industrial capitalist—profit 
and interest—this appears under both categories directly as a 
deduction from surplus value; what he sells to the workers is sale 
to variable capital. Finally he sells to the recipient of rent. 
The merchant lessens the number of  buyers  for productive capital. 
The merchant lessens the number of sellers for the consumer. 
Towards the industrialist he concentrates the consumers into 
fewer persons, towards the consumer he concentrates the produc­
ers into fewer persons. Hence a great curtailment of this exchange 
process or of the loss of time on labour, etc., conditioned by mere 
circulation. The function of pure merchants' capital, separated 
from the previously mentioned continuation of productive opera­
tions in the circulation process, such as transportation, etc.,a can be 
reduced simply to buying and selling. With developed capitalist 
production and a developed division of labour we also find 
merchants' capital functioning in a certain sphere in its pure form, 
separated from its entanglement with other operations. E.g. 
forwarding and transport only concern the merchant in so far as 
they enter into the BUYING PRICE of the commodity, as ITEMS among 
the costs constituting its price. Similarly rent for WAREHOUSING, which 
falls to the share of another capital, that invested in DOCKS, etc. 
Finally, RETAILING does not fall within the province of merchants' 
capital, but of another section of merchants. 
Merely buying and selling involves the MERCHANT in costs over and 
above the capital directly advanced, hence existing in the form of 
either money capital or commodity capital; namely the part of 
capital which really belongs to him. Firstly buying and selling 
themselves; the time this kind of labour costs (function); writing, 
calculating, accounting, travel costs, cost of correspondence, etc. 
And with bigger capital the clerks, the assistants who work for the 
merchant, finally HIS OFFICE. Whatever of his own labour goes into 
a See this volume, pp. 38-48.— Ed. 

=====第168页=====
158 Capital  and  Profit 
the shit  can be  deducted from profit, just  as with every other kind 
of capital.  The  outlays this causes form  a second part  of the 
capital, which  is not  directly INVESTED  IN WARES. They  are  costs 
incurred  in buying  and  selling over  and  above  the  part  of capital 
which  is directly involved  in this function.  And the  merchant adds 
to this part  of capital  the  same profit  as he  adds  to the  other  one, 
or the  price  of the  commodity must  not  only replace the^e costs 
for him, but  yield  a profit  on them.  The  whole thing therefore 
enters  as an  element into  the surcharge  the  merchant adds  to the 
price  of the  commodity,  or into  the  excess  of the  SELLING  PRICE  over 
the BUYING PRICE. This excess therefore makes good  a part  of the 
costs which derive from  the  operation  of BUYING  and  SELLING  itself, 
and which  are for the  merchant  as it  were included  in the  BUYING 
PRICE  of the  commodity, although  he does  not  have  to pay  them  to 
the seller  but  must himself advance them. 
These circulation costs—or costs  of pure merchants' capital— 
can be divided  up into  an insignificant part, which  has to do  with 
the consumption  of commodities themselves, namely  e.g.  travel 
costs,  POSTAGE, paper,  ink,  OFFICE,  etc.; and a  more important part, 
which consists  in the  payment  of alien labour, which  is formally wage 
labour, SINCE  it is  exchanged directly  for  capital,  and is  only 
exchanged  for it in the  reproduction process  of capital. Both sorts 
of circulation costs occur  in part  in productive capital itself  (its 
mercantile  or office costs); since circulation  is after  all its own  process. 
With merchants' capital,  in contrast, these costs occur  as indepen­
dent.  In the  former case  the  OFFICE stands alongside  the  factory, 
mine, FARM,  etc. In the  latter case  the  OFFICE  is there  as such with  its 
outgoings. 
These costs  are not  incurred  in the  production  of the 
commodity  itself, i.e.  they  are not  necessary  in the  labour process 
in order  to produce  its use  value. They  are  rather incurred  in or 
for the  circulation  of commodities; they  are  necessary  in order  to 
realise them  as value. They  are  necessary  for  their reproduction 
process.  The  commodity  is a  unity  of exchange value  and use 
value;  but it is use  value whose [XVII-1032] exchange value exists 
only ideally  as price  and  must first  be realised.  In so far as  this 
realisation gives rise  to costs, those costs enter into  the  reproduc­
tion costs  of the  commodity, although  not  into  its  direct 
production cost. These reproduction costs also occur without 
capitalist production,  as soon  as production becomes commodity 
production  in general.  The  circulation process  is not  only  the 
realisation  of surplus value,  it is  rather only  the  latter  in so far as it 
is simultaneously  and  above  all the  realising  of value.

Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital (Notebook XV) 159 
Since merchants' capital is absolutely nothing but a form of 
productive capital functioning in the circulation process which has 
achieved an independent position, all questions relating to it must be 
solved by posing the problem first in the form in which those 
phenomena peculiar to  MERCANTILE  capital do not yet appear 
independently, but rather as directly linked, in direct connection, 
with productive capital. As  OFFICE  in contrast to factory, productive 
capital functions continuously in the circulation process. We 
therefore have first to consider the OFFICE and its costs, and their 
relation to the value and surplus value of commodities, where the 
office appears as the side of productive capital itself which is 
turned to circulation. 
OFFICE costs can be reduced  d'abord"  to the rent of accommoda­
tion, which is itself in turn composed of ground rent, interest for 
the capital fixed in the house, and finally the annual depreciation 
in replacement of that capital. 
The rent is merely a part of the surplus value, as is the interest. 
The capitalist does not pocket them  himself;  he pays them to 
another capitalist. That does not change anything in the situation. 
They appear to him as costs. They are, nonetheless, deductions 
from the surplus value created by the worker. This part of the 
costs of circulation can therefore be reduced to the fact that 
productive capital has to pay a part of the surplus value, in the 
form of house rent, to another capitalist and to the LANDLORD. 
Only a part of the OFFICE rent remains as a real advance, the 
depreciation of the house which is to be replaced annually. Now 
come the office costs, which can all be reduced to paper, ink, pens, 
STAMPS and the salaries of clerks, travelling salesmen, etc. The fixed 
capital needed by these fellows, apart from the raw material of the 
paper, etc., comes down to the depreciation of the house (this part 
of the rent of the accommodation) and the few miserable sticks of 
furniture they need to set up an office. These are costs which the 
productive capitalist must cover, pay cash for, to a greater or 
lesser extent, depending on the particular nature of his business; 
they form a real capital advance, and are not concealed surplus 
value which appears as a cost to the person who must pay it and as 
interest or rent, i.e. appears in the form of surplus value, to the 
other person, who pockets it. 
In calculating the rate of profit the capitalist counts this part of 
the capital advanced just as much as he does the part advanced in 
raw material, machines, etc. These are values which are consumed, 
a First.— Ed. 

=====第170页=====
160 Capital and Profit 
and must be consumed, not to produce the commodity  itself,  i.e. 
the use value of the commodity, but to make it circulate as a 
commodity, and it could not be reproduced without them; since it 
must be converted into money, must have realised its value, before 
its reproduction. They form part of the faux frais* of production, 
i.e. they are costs of reproduction which are not costs incurred in 
the manufacture of the use value of the commodities, but derive 
instead from their economic form as commodity. Relatively, these 
costs are always very insignificant as compared with the real 
outlays for production, and they are the more insignificant the 
larger they appear; because they are only noticeable where a big 
capital is set in motion, in proportion to which they are 
visible—on account of their concentration—but relatively weaker 
than in the case of a small capital. Yet we are not concerned here 
with the quantity, but with their qualitative determination. 
In any case, these outlays have the peculiarity, which distin­
guishes them from the actual costs of production, that whereas the 
rate of profit (here=rate of surplus value, as we disregard the 
adjustment) depends in the best case on the costs of production, 
here inversely the costs stand in proportion to the amount of 
profit. If the business is small, the amount of profit is small, so the 
office costs are minimal, since the producer can take care of this 
almost alone. If the business is large, the amount of profit is large, 
so office costs increase and occasion a certain degree of division of 
labour. The great extent to which these costs are associated with 
the profit is shown e.g. in the fact that if they increase, a part of 
the salary is paid by giving a percentage share in that profit. In so 
far as the salary assumes this form, this part of the office costs is 
reduced to a deduction from the profit of the capitalists, a 
deduction which nevertheless leaves him the AVERAGE RATE, because 
he works under more favourable conditions than the AVERAGE 
CONDITIONS OF PRODUCTION. 
Hence this is also to be eliminated from the question. 
In any case, these office costs—in so far as they do not consist 
of the labour of the capitalist  himself,  in so far as they have to be 
paid and require advances — enter into those advances. They enter 
into the price of the commodity, and, [XVII-1033] for the 
commodity to be able to be reproduced, a part of its value must be 
set aside (hence a part of the commodity itself must be exchanged) 
for the OFFICE, pens, ink, paper, salaries of the clerks, etc. Since 
these expenses add nothing to the use value of the commodity, are 
Overhead costs.— Ed. 

=====第171页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital (Notebook XV) 161 
expenses which do not enter into the direct production process, 
the capitalist seeks to restrict them as much as possible. In so far 
as that part of the value of the commodity is realised which 
constitutes wages, these expenses belong to the conditions of 
production of the commodity- producing labour itself (even if no 
capitalist were there), they belong therefore to the conditions of 
reproduction of the salary, [and] to the conditions of labour. A 
part of the annual labour of the country is therefore employed in 
the reproduction of these conditions. The worker must therefore 
reproduce them as capital, if not as profit as well. In so far as they 
are required to reproduce the part of the value of the commodities 
which represents surplus value, they have nothing to do with the 
worker as such. UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, as expenses which have 
always to be reproduced, they reduce the rate of profit and the 
amount of profit in so far as this part of capital cannot be laid out 
in, raw material, wages, etc. 
The only question which opens up here is this: The clerks and 
other members of the office are formally wage labourers. They 
sell their labour capacity directly to capital. If the productive 
capitalist now makes a profit, does he extract surplus value directly 
from this sort of wage labourer or not? Does their labour enter 
into the value of the commodity, and how? Here, notabene, it is not 
a matter of OVERLOOKERS, MANAGERS, who are employed in the act of 
production in a directing role, but of purely mercantile workers, 
who are only concerned with the realisation of the value of the 
commodity, and the functional labours that are involved in the 
circulation process of the commodity. 
There is, at the outset, an analogy between the clerks and the 
wage labourers: If e.g. a division of labour is introduced among 
them, the same number will perform more labour. But they 
receive their wages as individuals. The wage bears no relation to 
the productivity of their labour. The social character of their 
labour appears to them as rather a productive power of capital 
and a form belonging to capital  itself. 
Further: The more intensive or extensive their working day, the 
fewer of them does the capitalist need to retain. The higher his 
rate of profit on a given aliquot part of capital, e.g. 100, the lower 
is this ITEM of costs, and the more, pro rata, is the capital advanced 
lessened in proportion to the surplus value. The greater is then 
the amount of profit, since a proportionately greater part of the 
capital can be employed directly in production. 
Just as labour is involved in direct production, so is the clerk in 
the direct reproduction of alien wealth. His labour, like that of the 

=====第172页=====
162 Capital and Profit 
worker, is only a means for the reproduction of capital, as the 
power which commands him, and at the same time as the worker 
creates surplus value, the clerk is employed in helping its 
realisation, not for  himself,  but for capital. 
But there always remains this difference between these mercan­
tile workers and the wage labourers engaged in the production 
process: The more labour the capitalist extracts from the latter, 
the greater his surplus value. The more unpaid labour they 
perform, the more saleable, but unpaid, value they produce. And 
the greater the number of workers employed at a given stage of 
production, the greater the amount of surplus value. Surplus 
value can in general only be created by labour, whose realisation 
depends on its quantity, irrespective of whether this labour is, or is 
not, paid for. With the mercantile wage labourers, on the other 
hand, the value they add to the commodity is never greater than 
what they themselves cost; it depends not on their labour but on 
the value of their labour capacity. The capitalist can only extract 
surplus value from them in so far as he pays their labour capacity 
at less than its value, but reckons it among the ITEMS of cost at its 
value. This case does not belong here, where we always 
presuppose that full values are paid. The less the capitalist pays 
the MERCANTILE worker, i.e. the more he has him work for the same 
price, the smaller his costs. I.e. the less it costs him to realise the 
surplus value. But the latter is not itself affected by this (only 
indirectly, in so far as a large part of the capital can be invested in 
productive expenditure). The increase in the number of these 
workers as such therefore occurs only if there is more value and 
surplus value to be realised, hence more of this kind of labour is 
required. It is always a result, never a cause of the increase of 
surplus value. 
The mercantile worker has something else in common with the 
wage labourer proper: What is paid to him is the value—the cost 
of reproduction—of his specific labour capacity, which stands 
higher than that of the wage labourer. (Incidentally, this depends 
very much on competition, and becomes ever cheaper WITH THE 
PROGRESS OF CIVILISATION.) With the development of capitalist produc­
tion—and therefore of civilisation—this labour capacity depre­
ciates.  Its cost of reproduction becomes cheaper: 1) because of the 
emergence of the division of labour, which means that [XVII-
1034] a more one-sided capacity needs to be produced, and part 
of the cost of this production is not borne by the capitalist since, 
like the aptitudes of the worker, this capacity develops by the 
exercise of the function  itself,  and develops the more rapidly the 

=====第173页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital (Notebook XV) 163 
more one-sided the function becomes with the division of labour; 
2) because the preliminary training, the acquisition of the 
knowledge of reading, writing, arithmetic and commercial matters 
in general, language skills, etc., becomes ever quicker with the 
progress of science, and can be reproduced more easily, more 
universally and more cheaply, the more the capitalist mode of 
production predominates, and therefore science and methods of 
teaching are directed to practical ends; 3) [because of] the 
introduction of universal public education, which permits the 
recruitment of this kind of worker from classes which were 
previously excluded, and are accustomed to an inferior living 
standard. The development of capitalist production therefore 
devalues the labour capacity of these people, their salaries, while 
their capacity for work increases; partly through better prelimi­
nary training, and superior skill resulting from the increase in the 
division of labour and the tradition handed down from the past. 
The auxiliary means of this labour, such as all the necessary books 
on commercial arithmetic, etc., and the art of book-keeping, etc., 
are also perfected. 
But the labour time these people have to work stands in no 
connection with the labour time required for the reproduction of 
their labour capacity. All the labour they perform over and above 
this is unpaid labour time, which capital appropriates without an 
equivalent. Its costs would otherwise be very much increased, if it 
only received an equivalent in EXCHANGE for the value of this labour 
capacity which it pays. Its rate of profit would be very much 
reduced. But whatever the relation of the unpaid to the paid 
labour time which this kind of worker provides for capital, this 
unpaid labour never increases the value of the commodity, and it 
therefore does not add any surplus value to it. All it does is lessen 
the cost of realising the value, hence lessen the ratio of the capital 
advanced to the surplus value, hence increase the rate of profit in 
the same proportion as it is not paid and no equivalent for it 
enters into the costs of production. It never adds to the value of 
the commodity more than its own value, hence never more than 
its cost, however far that cost may sink below the labour time for 
which the labour is active. If the capitalist could reduce this labour 
to 0, the rate of profit and the amount of profit would be higher 
to a corresponding degree. But if, on the other hand, the (actual) 
wage labour were reduced to 0, profit would vanish and, with 
surplus value, capital  itself. 
The side of capital turned towards circulation therefore appears 
double to the money capital, which must always buy. This achieves 

=====第174页=====
164 Capital and Profit 
an independent position in the shape of MERCANTILE capital, as 
capital which is always in the state of circulation, and which both 
alternately assumes the forms of commodity and of money and 
also,  although in different proportions at different times, always 
exists simultaneously in both forms. 
But productive capital not only alternately assumes the forms of 
commodity and money in the circulation process, its function thus 
appearing as that of selling and buying; not only must it always, 
for the sake of the continuity of the production process, be 
represented IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CIRCULATING CAPITAL, CONSISTING IN 
MONEY. Buying and selling requires labour and this labour gives rise 
to costs, circulation costs. These are represented, alongside the 
productive workshop, in the OFFICE and its costs, which can be 
reduced partly to the consumption of the commodities needed to 
perform this labour of circulation, partly to the wages of the 
workers who are only employed in functions which arise from the 
circulation process of the commodity, partly in the realisation of its 
value, partly in the reconversion of the realised value into 
conditions of production, or, to look at this purely formally, in 
selling and buying. The commodities are sold to realise their 
value, they are bought (by the productive capitalist) for the 
purpose of reproduction, of starting industrial consumption or 
renewing it. This part of the capital advanced does not exist with 
the FARMER, e.g.; it is barely visible with the small industrialist, it 
attains a PALPABLE form in large-scale industry, but, like all the 
determinations which are appropriate to productive capital as 
circulating capital, it appears independently with  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL. 
Besides the part of mercantile capital which functions as commodi­
ty or money, another part is advanced in  OFFICE  costs,  and in the 
wages of its IN and OUT OF DOOR FUNCTIONARIES. This is the only 
workshop of MERCANTILE capital. The part of capital employed in 
this way appears much larger with the big MERCHANT than with the 
industrialist, because apart from the  MERCANTILE  OFFICES  proper which 
are associated with every productive workshop, the part of 
productive capital which would have to be employed in this 
manner by the whole class of productive capitalists is concentrated 
in the hands of individual MERCHANTS, who, just as they attend to 
the continuation of the function of circulation, attend also to the 
continuation of the costs of circulation which grows out of this 
continuation. What is true of the other part of  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL  is 
true of this one. Every individual mercantile capital functions for  A 
LOT OF PRODUCTIVE CAPITALS, and the whole of the mercantile capital 
laid out in this way replaces a capital which in this form was

employed by the whole [XVII-1035] PRODUCTIVE  CLASS,  and it replaces 
it with a smaller amount, since the total amount of these 
circulation costs is lessened by division and concentration of 
labour. It is precisely in this way that it increases the capital 
employed in production itself and thereby indirectly the produc­
tive power and the quantity of the productive capital. 
In so far as these costs enter into the function of MERCANTILE 
CAPITAL, they naturally do not form, as costs of this kind, a part of 
its profit. As we saw directly with productive capital, they enter 
into the price of the commodity as capital advanced, costs of 
production. In so far as these costs of realising the price (selling) 
or converting value into commodity (buying)—these costs of 
circulation—enter into the difference between the  MERCANTILE  SELLING 
PRICE and the  BUYING  PRICE,  this part of the difference does not form 
a profit, and it is not a part of the surplus value, but rather a 
mere reproduction of capital advanced. So that if we are speaking 
of mercantile profit, this part of the merchant's EXPENSES, or this 
part of the SELLING PRICE, or RATHER the difference between SELLING 
PRICE and BUYING PRICE, must be deducted. 
But there is a considerable difference between the relation of 
MERCANTILE capital to its MERCANTILE wage labourers—and the same 
relation between productive capital and its MERCANTILE clerks, etc. 
It goes without saying, first of all, that just as the function of 
MERCANTILE CAPITAL creates absolutely no surplus value (the same is 
true of the MERCANTILE part of PRODUCTIVE capital), the workers 
employed by it create no surplus value either. The costs of 
circulation always increase the capital outlay, and always reduce 
the rate of profit. The commodities which are consumed in 
circulation are withdrawn as much from industrial as from 
individual consumption, and the labour which is performed there 
is always a deduction from productive labour. 
The relation of  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL  to surplus value is different 
from the relation of productive capital. The former appropriates a 
part of the surplus value, TRANSFERS PART OF IT TO ITSELF. The latter 
produces it by direct exploitation of labour, direct appropriation 
of alien labour. The costs of circulation appear to productive 
capital as expenses; they appear to mercantile capital as the source 
of its profit, which—presupposing the general rate of profit—is in 
proportion to the magnitude of the costs of circulation. For 
mercantile capital, therefore, INVESTMENT in these costs of circulation 
is productive INVESTMENT. Hence the MERCANTILE LABOUR it buys is also, 
for it, directly productive. It is only through its function of 
realising value that mercantile capital functions as capital in the 
12-613

166 Capital and Profit 
reproduction process. The amount of profit it makes depends on 
the amount of capital it can employ in this process, and the 
greater the unpaid labour of the clerks, the more of this capital 
can it employ (the more capital can it employ in buying and 
selling). For the most part, however, it has its workers perform the 
function  itself,  through which its capital acts as reproductive 
capital (not merely interest-bearing capital, for example), but it 
pays them as labour capacity. Although the unpaid labour of these 
clerks does not create surplus value, any more than mercantile 
capital does in general, it does create for it an appropriation of 
surplus value, which for the particular capital is the same thing. It 
is therefore a source of profit for it. Mercantile business could 
otherwise never be conducted on a large scale—in capitalist 
fashion. The relation of the  MERCHANT  to his "clerks, etc." is 
therefore much more analogous to the relation of productive 
capital to the productive wage labourer than the relation of the 
clerks in the MERCANTILE  OFFICES  attached to the factory, etc., although 
the exploitation of the MERCANTILE worker himself is the same in 
both cases. 
Capital employed in money-dealing is a particular kind of 
commercial capital alongside capital employed in commodity-dealing. 
The one is a development of commodity capital, the other a 
development of money capital, or the one is a development of capital 
as commodity, the other of capital as money. Both are merely 
forms and modes of existence of productive capital present in the 
circulation process which have attained an independent role. Just as 
mercantile capital exists before productive capital, as the first free 
form of capital, so does money-dealing and capital employed 
therein  (MONEYED  CAPITAL,  interest-bearing capital, also belongs here) 
presuppose only merchants' capital [XVII-1036]; it therefore 
equally exists as a form of capital which  precedes  productive capital. 
Mercantile capital—within the capitalist reproduction process— 
is absolutely nothing but on the one hand productive capital in 
general in its circulation  C— M—C (which however simultaneously 
assumes a shape of its own, because the commodity here is capital: 
M—C'C"—M), in its function of buying and selling—or in the 
movement of the complete metamorphosis it passes through in its 
sphere of circulation, and on the other hand a part of productive 
capital which has been separated off from it, has become 
independent, and for which the sphere of circulation is the sphere 
of production peculiar to it. The situation is exactly the same with 
money-dealing capital. 
Circulating capital (and all capital circulates, even fixed capital, 

=====第177页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital (Notebook XV) 167 
to the extent that its depreciation enters into the commodity as a 
value component) is precipitated as money when it RETURNS from a 
circuit or appears as the starting point of a circuit. For a sum of 
value which must first be converted into capital, money appears as 
a starting point in isolation. This is only the case for newly invested 
capital But for capital already involved in the process, and 
therefore IN  A CONTINUAL  COURSE  OF REPRODUCTION,  both the concluding point 
and the starting point appear only as points of transit In so far as 
capital has to pass through C— M—C" between its stay in the 
sphere of production and its return to the latter, the M is in fact 
only the result of a phase of the metamorphosis, to become after 
that the starting-point for the opposite phase which complements 
it. Capital, however, simultaneously passes through the acts C— M 
and M—C. I.e. not only is there a capital in the stage M—C, 
while the other is in the stage C—M, but the same capital is 
simultaneously buying constantly and selling constantly, owing to 
the continuity of the production process. Capital is continuously to 
be found in both stages simultaneously. While a part of it is 
converted into money, to be reconverted into commodities, the 
other part is simultaneously converted into commodities, to be 
reconverted into money. Whether the money functions here as 
means of circulation or means of payment—in the second case so 
that the balances are paid, in the first case so that the value is 
always present in a dual form, at one pole as commodity, at the 
other as money—depends on the form of commodity exchange 
itself.  But in both cases the capitalist has constantly to pay out 
money (and to many people; the productive capitalist has to pay 
many merchants, the merchant has to pay many capitalists, etc.) in 
order constantly to receive money in payment. This merely 
technical operation of paying money and collecting money in itself 
constitutes labour, which, in so far as money functions as means of 
payment, makes acts of account settling necessary, after the 
balance has been calculated. This labour is a cost of circulation. A 
definite part of the capital must constantly be available as hoard 
(as a coin reserve, i.e. a reserve of means of purchase and a fund 
for payment, a reserve for payments) and a part of the capital 
constantly returns in this form. This makes necessary, apart from 
payment and collection, the keeping in safe custody of this hoard, 
which is in turn a separate operation. It is therefore in fact the 
constant dissolution of the hoard into means of circulation and 
means of payment, and its rebuilding as money obtained through 
sale or payment fallen due—this constant movement of the part 
of capital which constantly exists as money—separated from the 
12*

168 Capital and Profit 
function  itself,  this technical movement, which gives rise to 
particular labour and costs. Circulation costs. It is a result of the 
division of labour that these technical operations, which flow from 
the functions of capital, are allotted to definite functionaries on 
behalf of the whole capitalist class, and that these operations are 
concentrated in their hands. Here, as with merchants' capital, 
there is division of labour in a dual sense. It becomes a particular 
operation, a particular business, and because it becomes a 
particular business, performed for the whole class, it is concen­
trated, carried out on a large scale, and a division of labour takes 
place within it, both through its splitting into different branches 
which are independent of each other, and through the develop­
ment of the workshop within these branches. A part of the 
productive capital involved in this movement is separated off from 
productive capital, and is employed only in these operations—first 
the storing of the money, then its payment, collection, settlement 
of balances, etc.—which are separate from the acts necessitating 
these technical operations. This is [XVII-1037] productive capital 
which has attained an independent role in money dealing. 
If we now consider the reproduction process of a single capital, 
we see that the realised surplus value returns in the form of 
money. The profit is in part expended as income, and it must in 
part be reconverted into capital. The reproduction process is not 
only a simple reproduction process but a process of accumulation, 
reproduction on an increased scale. This manifests itself in part as 
accumulation of money. Whether the individual capitalist can 
immediately reconvert into capital his profit which exists in the 
form of money, i.e. utilise it within his reproduction process, 
depends 1) on the state of the market, which does not perhaps 
permit the extension of a particular business at that moment; 
2) also on the organic composition of his productive capital; since 
not every sum can be converted immediately into productive 
capital, this conversion depending in part on the technological 
conditions (I may have enough money to extend a factory, not 
enough to add a new one), in part on the magnitude of the sum, 
which must be large enough to be divided into variable and 
constant capital in the appropriate proportions. As long as this is 
not possible, the money is a hoard lying idle—now capital lying 
idle. The job of storing it falls to the money dealer. This is an 
operation of the money dealer which arises from a moment of the 
capitalist process of accumulation, which initially presents itself as 
accumulation of money (in part at least). As long as the capitalist 
cannot invest the money in his own business, he endeavours to 

=====第179页=====
Mercantile Capital. Money-dealing Capital (Notebook XV) 169 
valorise this idle hoard as interest-bearing capital, to lend it out. 
The money dealer does this for the whole class; lending and 
borrowing, like paying and collecting money, become a particular 
function of capital employed in money dealing—a function which 
proceeds from the reproduction process of capital  itself.  What 
previously appeared as a concentration of the hoard reservoir, now 
appears as simultaneously a concentration of money loanable as 
capital. 
The same is true of the capitalist who has brought his gains into 
safety but wants to consume them not as money but as capital, i.e. 
wants to live on interest. 
Similarly for all productive capitalists themselves—for the part of 
the profit they expend as income, yet NOT AT ONCE, but au fur et à 
mesure. 3 This consumption fund (the actual coin reserve) can be 
lent out as capital in the interval, and it must under all 
circumstances be accumulated as money IN CERTAIN DIMENSIONS. The 
same holds for the recipient of rent who wants, apart from this, to 
consume a part of his income as interest-bearing capital. Ditto for 
all unproductive workers whose income is in part capitalised, in 
part consumed au fur et à mesure, but received in larger portions at 
certain intervals. 
All this is concentrated as loan capital with the money dealer, 
who apart from this himself lends money and must keep READY 
definite funds, in order always to be able to pay. The function of 
his particular capital is only the independent form of the processes 
which emerge from the reproduction process of capital (conver­
sion of profit into capital), in part from the form of circulation; 
the fact that newly arisen capital steps forth in the form of money. 
The money dealer lends and borrows for the whole class, or 
rather he performs the lending and borrowing of the whole class. 
Exchange rate business and exchange business proceed from the 
function of money as world money; the difference between the 
national currencies. Finally the  BULLION  trade;  in part the settlement of 
international payments, therefore the movement back and forth of 
money capital (here capital, because it is a form of capital); in part 
the procurement of fresh supplies of gold and silver from their 
sources of production. The latter is in fact brought about by 
foreign trade. But the technical aspect, the BULLION RETURN, is taken 
over by the money dealer. Hoard formation—usurers' capital— 
the exchange of international coins—the BULLION trade (the ENGLISH 
GOLDSMITHS) form the foundations of the independent development 
a Gradually.— Ed.

of money dealing. It is specially connected with dealing in 
commodities [XVII-1038], since only merchants' capital—before 
the development of capitalist production—constantly buys and 
sells on a mass scale, lends and borrows, pays and collects, in short 
constantly has its wealth chiefly in the form of money.129 
Only with the credit system does  MONIED  CAPITAL and money dealing 
receive the form which emerges from the capitalist mode of 
production  itself. 
The profit of money dealing does not offer the same difficulty as 
that of mercantile capital. With the latter the difficulty arises from 
the fact that the profit originates through an addition to the prices 
of the commodities, and the commodity is sold dearer than it is 
bought; which appears to contradict the determination of the price 
of production and ultimately the value of the commodity by 
labour time. With the former, in contrast, the commodity as such 
remains entirely outside the picture, and by far the greater part of 
the money dealer's profit consists of the interest for which he 
lends capital, whereas he borrows it for nothing; or of the excess 
of the interest at which he lends it over the interest at which he 
borrows it. A part of the surplus value itself therefore directly 
appears as the source of his profit, and his profit merely appears 
as a share in that surplus value. 
We shall be able to go into this in more detail in the section on 
capital as credit,67 but this does not form part of our task at 
present.

EPISODE. * REFLUX* MOVEMENTS  OF  MONEY 
IN CAPITALIST REPRODUCTION 
Let us take first  the  circulation between productive capitalist  and 
SHOPKEEPER  and worker. Let the  SHOPKEEPER  represent all the sellers of 
the means  of subsistence which enter into  the  worker's consump­
tion. 
Money  is paid  as wages  by the  capitalist  to the  worker;  the 
worker gives  out  this money  as  means  of circulation, buys 
commodities from  the  SHOPKEEPER with  it; with  the  money  the 
SHOPKEEPER replaces  his  STOCK  from  the  capitalist,  who we  shall assume 
produces means  of subsistence. 
In so far as the  money  is exchanged  on the  part  of the  capitalist 
for labour,  it is  money which  is converted into productive capital. 
It is the  first element (disregarding  the  part  of the  money which  is 
converted into  raw  material,  etc.) in M—C—M, as  form  of the 
reproduction process  of capital. 
Furthermore,  as far as  this capitalist  is concerned,  the  money 
functions  as means  of purchase, means  of circulation.  C— M— 
C(L' a). (He has  converted  the  commodity into money  and now 
converts this money into labour, another commodity.) 
As far as the  worker  is concerned,  the  money  is simply coin.  L 
(his commodity)— M—C (the  commodity  he  buys from  the 
SHOPKEEPER);  a mere money form, which  his commodity assumes,  to 
be subsequently converted into means  of subsistence. 
With  the  SHOPKEEPER,  the  money functions initially  as means  of 
circulation.  C— M—C. He is  constantly selling commodities  and 
buying  new  commodities with  the  money.  But  CONSIDERING that  he 
bought  the  commodity before  he sold  it, his  process presents itself 
a Labour capacity.—  Ed. 

=====第182页=====
172 Capital and Profit 
as M—C—M'  M'—C, etc. And this REFLUX represents here the 
capitalist movement. 
This money in the hands of the capitalist in the act M—L 
(labour 130 as commodity), disregarding the fact that it is means of 
circulation (means of purchase), represents capital, but only a 
capital in the course of changing its form. It is converted from the 
form of money into the form of labour, from the form of money 
into that of the commodity. This is a change of form which capital 
undergoes in the reproduction process, but it does not express a 
valorisation of capital; for the money the capitalist pays=the value 
of the labour capacity he buys. No surplus value arises out of this 
process, considered in  itself.  Surplus value only arises from the 
industrial consumption of the commodity. 
For the worker the money, as being merely coin, merely 
represents income. This is always the case where the money merely 
represents the simple metamorphosis C— M—C; the conversion 
of the commodity into money, so that it can be converted into 
means of subsistence. In fact exchange of the commodity for 
means of subsistence. Mr. Tooke calls money that is spent in this 
manner income, because it must in fact derive from an income, 
wages, profit—interest or rent. 3 
[XVII-1039] Lastly, if we consider the  SHOPKEEPER,  for him the 
money is not only the form of his capital but its REFLUX movement, 
it is the movement of his capital.  M—C—M',  money which 
returns increased from circulation, self-valorising value. We shall 
consider this point presently. 
However, it is clear even now that nothing can be more 
incorrect than Tooke's direct identification of the different 
determinations of the form of money with the question whether 
they represent capital or income. Thus for example money as 
means of circulation=income, but when it is not expended as 
income it is capital 
D'abord? money appears as means of circulation in all 3 processes. 
For the capitalist C— M—L'. For the worker L— M—C. For the 
SHOPKEEPER C— M—C". The same money functions here further as 
a mere change in the form of capital, as income, as 
capital+income; i.e. as capital which constitutes capital in relation 
to itself. 
If we consider the whole process of the productive capitalist, 
money is merely a form of his capital, a form which he changes

Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 173 
through his exchange with labour; considered from the point of 
view of the content, this is a reconversion into conditions of 
production. The same money in the worker's hands becomes 
income and circulates as income. The same money returning into 
the hands of the épicier 3=capital + profit, and its departure from the 
shopkeeper in renewed purchases from the productive capitalist is 
a mere change in the form of his capital, which denotes a moment 
in the process of reproduction. It is therefore ridiculous to say 
that this money is income or capital or ANYTHING OF THE SORT. 
Let us assume that the productive capitalist has bought labour 
capacity for £100; the workers buy with this money £100 of 
commodities (which the SHOPKEEPER has bought from the capitalist) 
and they thur return his money to him. This REFLUX expresses for 
him the conc'uding process of a part of his capital. M—C—M'. 
He has withdrawn more money from circulation than he threw in. 
If the profit= 10%, the commodities he sold for 100 cost him 90 10/n. 
(9'/ii profit on the 100.) He sells the commodities to the workers for 
100 and buys them from the capitalist for 9010 /n. But in fact in his 
sale to the SHOPKEEPER the capitalist does not realise the whole value of 
these commodities—the production price of these commodities, but 
leaves the épicier to realise Vu of the value. The workers therefore 
obtain commodities the real production price of which  =100.  They 
obtain an equivalent for their 100. And when the épicier makes his 
profit on the commodities he is merely participating in the capitalist's 
profit. 
In examining how the different parts of the total capital are 
exchanged for each other,132  how their values are realised one 
through the other, and how their use values replace each other, 
we saw that if we subsume the épicier under the productive 
capitalist, or entirely leave him aside, the transaction presents itself 
like this: The capitalist pays £100 for the labour of the workers: 
the latter buy back from him £100 worth of commodities. Thus 
the £100 flow back to him. But in this transaction the capitalist 
gains nothing. Instead of directly paying the workers commodities 
to the value of £100, he pays them a value of £100 in the form of 
exchange value (real money or tokens of value), and as soon as he 
receives this £100 back, he pays in commodities. Although every 
part of the commodity contains value, and every individual 
commodity consists in equal parts of C+P, cost and profit, paid 
labour and unpaid labour, the part of the total product (or of the 
value of the total product) which is paid in wages contains no 
a Shopkeeper.— Ed. 

=====第184页=====
174 Capital and Profit 
SURPLUS VALUE, if it is considered in isolation, just as the part of the 
total product which replaces the constant capital contains no 
surplus value—because the whole of this part of the product 
(after the remplacements have been deducted) is then calculated as 
consisting merely of SURPLUS labour. 
Hence for the épicier (who trades with the workers) to be able 
constantly to withdraw more money from circulation than he 
throws in, all that is needed is that enough money should circulate 
to pay the workers' wages. The épicier withdraws more money 
from circulation than he throws in because he in fact throws more 
value into circulation than he withdraws from it. Admittedly, the 
means of subsistence he bought from the capitalist had a value (we 
say here value for price of production, since we are dealing with 
capital as a whole and consider every particular sphere only as a 
part of the total capital) of [XVII-1040] 100, but a realised value 
of only 90 10/n. But he throws them into circulation with their 
adequate, full value expression of 100. And for the question we 
are considering here it is entirely the same thing whether the 
commodity is thrown into circulation with a higher value than that 
with which it was originally withdrawn therefrom, because its value 
has grown, or because a merely latent value has been made 
manifest, realised. We say: this is the same thing here, where we 
are considering the relation of circulating money to the reproduc­
tion process. 
Let us assume that the épicier consumes his profit entirely, and 
in the same articles he buys from the capitalist. In this case, if he 
originally buys with £90 10/n, he sells these commodities to the 
workers for 100, and with this 100 he can buy back not only 
enough to replace the commodity capital which was to be sold to 
the workers (namely £100 worth of commodities for £9010 /n) but 
also Vu of the commodity value of 100 for his own consumption. 
Hence in this case he would buy back from the productive 
capitalist commodities to the value of £100. The sum of money 
(£100) the capitalist needs to pay the workers would therefore 
constantly flow back to him from the épicier. If the épicier buys for 
£90 10/n, he obtains a commodity value of £100, and he sells this 
to the workers for £100. If he buys for £100, he obtains a 
commodity value of £110. Therefore, after he has sold a value of 
100 to the workers, he retains a commodity value of £10 for his 
own personal consumption. 
Here, therefore, we see d'abord an example in which it is only 
required that the capitalist should pay the workers their wages 
weekly (or over some other period)—hence that money to the 

=====第185页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 175 
amount of their wages should circulate—for the épicier to be able 
constantly to withdraw from circulation more money than he 
threw in. In this case 10/n ((9 1/ii)H=99+11 /ii=100) is constantly 
returned by the épicier to the capitalist from the circulation he 
requires in order to pay wages. But he would have to procure the 
remaining Vu in some other way, which we shall discuss later. 
Secondly, however, if the épicier realised his profit of £9 Vu in the 
commodities of the capitalist  himself,  the £100 of wages paid by 
the capitalist would be sufficient not only for the workers to obtain 
their wages and the épicier to replace his capital, but also for him 
simultaneously to realise his profit. To pay the wages of his 
workers periodically, therefore, the capitalist would need no other 
fund than this circulation between  himself,  his workers and the 
épicier. As for the SHOPKEEPER, he would constantly withdraw from 
circulation more value than he threw into it (expressed as value), 
namely £110, while he only threw in £100. Nevertheless he would 
always throw into circulation as much money as he took out, 
namely £100. In this case, however, he constantly withdraws £110 
worth of commodities from circulation and only throws back £100 
worth. This version of the matter appears to contradict the previous 
one. First we said that he withdrew more money from circulation 
than he threw in, because he threw in commodities of greater 
value than he withdrew. Now we say that he throws exactly as much 
money in as he takes out, because he withdraws commodities of 
greater value from circulation than he throws back into it. The two 
are in fact identical expressions. In the one case he realises his 
surplus value in commodities, in the other in money. The épicier 
constantly withdraws from circulation a commodity value of £110 
for £100, while he only throws into circulation, sells to the 
workers, a commodity value of £100. This is the result of the fact 
that he constantly withdraws (realised) commodity value from 
circulation for £90 10/n. and throws back into it a value of 100 
(realised in the same quantity of commodities). 
At any rate, we have here an example in which the same 
circulation (£100) suffices for the capitalist to pay wages; suffices 
at the same time for the épicier to realise a SURPLUS value of £10, 
and finally the same amount suffices for the épicier to realise 
capital and income, and for the capitalist constantly to expend the 
same amount for the repeated purchase of the same amount of 
labour. 43 
Let us assume that the capital of the épicier is £1,200. Let this 
sum turn over 4 times a year, so that every year he makes £4,800 
worth of purchases from the capitalist, which is £400 a month and 

=====第186页=====
176 Capital and Profit 
£100 a week. His own capital would be replaced in the first 
quarter. If the rate of profit were 10% per annum—hence the 
4fold turnover were the  AVERAGE  REVOLUTION  OF THE  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL— 
the épicier would add 2Va% on each 100, for 10% on 1,200=120, 
and 120 on 4,800=2'/2%- In this case, if the épicier paid 100 he 
would obtain a commodity value [XVII-1041] of IO2V2, and since 
he only gives the workers a commodity value of 100 for £100, 
these £100 worth of commodities would cost him  £91 2iU\. 
Here, therefore, a weekly circulation of £100 (the £100 turn over 
4 times a month and 48 times in the year) would 1) pay for labour43 
with an annual value of £4,800, and 2) realise a commodity value 
of £4,800. Taken together, a value of £9,600 would be realised. 
Apart from this, the capital of £100 would return to the capitalist 
at the end of the whole circuit, whether this was itself equal to a 
value of £100 (if gold money, etc.) or it was only represented by a 
token of value or credit paper, which is the same thing for this 
discussion. While it realised these commodity values, the £100 
would at the same time have replaced the épicier's capital of 1,200 
and realised a profit of 120. 
(The calculation is in itself absurd on account of the hypotheses. 
For if the épicier only needs 100 in turnover, he cannot invest a 
capital of  1,200.  We should then have to assume that, apart from 
the sum which he always has  READY  and which after all amounts at 
most to Vs of what is being turned over, hence £40 at most, the 
remainder is counted for his  SHOP,  wages, etc., circulation costs. We 
should then have to calculate a higher surcharge: 10% profit and 
so much, etc., for the replacement of the fixed capital. We should 
then have had to bring into the calculation as well the circulation 
between the épicier and his own workers.) 
But what we are concerned with here, and what is the case 
independently of any hypotheses, is this: In one single cycle of the 
circulation of the capital, in which the capitalist lays out £100 in 
labour, the workers buy commodities with the £100 from the 
épicier, and the épicier uses this £100 to buy back commodities 
from the capitalist, the £100 buy labour for £100 and com­
modities for £200, namely the £100 of commodities the workers 
buy from the épicier, and the £100 of commodities the épicier buys 
from the capitalist. This admittedly expresses, in so far as we are 
considering the circulation of money, merely its circuit,  M—C— 
M—C, etc. But at the same time, if we look at the process which 
lies hidden behind this, [it expresses] a complete cycle of the 
reproduction process, which contains, entwined together, the mo­
ments of production, consumption, distribution, circulation and

Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 177 
reproduction. In contrast to this, the 40 turnovers of the £100 in 
the year express the 40fold repetition of this complete cycle. A 
single cycle may proceed slowly or quickly, the amount circulating 
may be big or small, but the money must pass through these 
turnovers. ITS SUFFICIENCY for the 40 times greater amount, on the 
other hand, has as its condition a given number of repetitions of the 
cycle, hence that the reproductions of the whole cycle of 
reproduction over a year should be sufficiently rapid. 
Assume that the capitalist pays the workers £100 out of his own 
pocket (before he has begun to trade with the épicier). The épicier 
buys with £100 from his pocket a commodity value of £110 from the 
capitalist (namely £90 10/u of commodities for resale and 9'/n for his 
own consumption). £200 of money has now been laid out, therefore. 
£100 is in the pockets of the workers. The capitalist for his part has 
replaced the £100 through the sale of the commodities. As soon as 
the cycle has started, and the £100 has passed from the workers to 
the épicier, and flowed back from the latter to the capitalist in 
purchases, £200 is in the capitalist's pocket. But he pays his workers 
with the £100 he receives back from the épicier, not with the £100 he 
received from him before the cycle. £100 of money is now thrown 
out of this circulation. But the capitalist now may retain £100 less in 
the form of money. He can invest it elsewhere. The CURRENCY flows to 
him from the épicier. This is in general the service performed by 
capital engaged purely in trade. The capitalist does not gain any 
capital thereby. For he provided £100 of commodities for the first 
£100,  and for the £100 of the épicier, with which he pays the workers 
from now on, he must always provide commodities afresh. But what 
he gains is that he can invest this value of £100 elsewhere. Whether 
the épicier was the original owner of the £100 or not is demonstrated 
at the end of the first cycle. If it was his, he now has £100, just as 
before, since he has consumed the surplus value of £10 in 
commodities. If it belonged to the capitalist, the épicier has to pay out 
the £100. If he buys anew, this happens in fact with fresh credit. 
[XVII-1042] In the real reproduction process we must presume 
that one part of the profit is consumed as income, another 
part is accumulated. Let us assume that the épicier, who makes a 
profit of 10% on a capital of 100 (this 100 needs to be merely an 
aliquot part of his capital and stands for x here), consumes half of 
the 10% and accumulates the other  half.  On our assumption the 
workers buy from him £100 worth of commodities, which cost him 
£90 10/n. His profit=£9Vn- But in order to simplify the calculation 
we should  • prefer to say, and the relation is the same here: the 
workers buy for £110 commodities which cost him £100. £110 is 

=====第188页=====
178 Capital and Profit 
here what the capitalist has to pay the workers; he only receives 
the whole sum back from the épicier if the latter constantly 
consumes the £10 profit, and indeed consumes it in the capitalist's 
commodities. If he consumes £5, £105 comes back to the 
capitalist, and if this occurs regularly this amount is constantly in 
circulation. The capitalist, on the other hand, would constantly 
have to draw £5 from sources other than this cycle of circulation 
and, through wages, throw them into circulation as SURPLUS, except 
under certain circumstances which will appear shortly. 
The £5 the épicier accumulates is initially accumulated by him in 
the form of money, and this is the sole, most direct, immediate form 
in which he can accumulate, unlike the productive capitalist. The 
productive capitalist can accumulate in natura, if his product itself 
enters as a condition of production into  itself,  as e.g. wheat does as 
wheat seed in agriculture, or he can accumulate through 
exchange, as do e.g. the machine manufacturer and iron 
producer. (What would correspond to this in the case of the 
SHOPKEEPER, perhaps, would be an increase in the part of his capital 
which enters into the circulation costs of his circulating capital, 
such as buildings, etc. But even so this too requires a prior 
conversion into money.) 
//It is true that accumulation may appear with all capitalists as 
accumulation of unsold commodities (presupposing here that they 
have sold the part of the commodities which replaces their capital). 
But this is always involuntary accumulation and it hinders 
reproduction, with one sole exception. The capitalist may consider 
it necessary to produce an increasing reserve fund of commodities 
to cover increasing demand (this can naturally only happen with 
commodities which can be preserved  FOR  SOME  TIME, such as clothing 
materials and the raw material for them, etc., cattle, machines, 
etc., metals, etc.), and so  FAR (this may also be case for the 
SHOPKEEPER)  all accumulation amounts to annual overproduction, an 
overproduction which is the law of expanding production, not 
stagnant production.// 
Our SHOPKEEPER may now accumulate this £5 straight away in real 
terms as capital, i.e. convert it into capital, or only accumulate it as 
the material of capital, as money capital destined for reproduction, 
but temporarily at rest. This is in fact a mere hoard, but with the 
determination of capital lying fallow. 
With £100 the SHOPKEEPER bought commodities of a value of 110; 
the capitalist paid the workers £110 of wages; the workers paid 
the SHOPKEEPER the £110 for commodities which are worth 110 but 
only cost the SHOP 100. On our first presupposition the SHOp[keeper] 

=====第189页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 179 
spends with the same capitalist, apart from the 100 needed for the 
replacement of his commodity capital (which has a value of 110), 
10 more for his own personal consumption. For 110 he receives 
commodities of a value of 121, but he consumes this value of 21 
or sells it to  himself.  The commodities cost him only 10, although 
they are worth £21; but cost him as his own customer the value of 
21. (Just as he obtained 110 for 100 (in the case where his capital 
was 90'°/n) but consumed 10. The £110, however, circulates 
constantly; it provides the money for both the workers' wages and 
the épicier's commodities, as well as the commodities the épicier 
buys back; equally the £110 replaces his capital and his profit.) 
If the épicier always consumes £5 and accumulates £5 (as 
distinct from the HOARD, which is always involuntary with the 
capitalist, but which is, both for him and for the hoarder, money 
withdrawn from circulation, exchange value at rest as money) the 
situation remains the same in so far as he still buys commodities 
for £110; £100 to replace his capital, £5 as profit added to the 
capital, and £5 for his own consumption. But certain distinctions 
enter here. As far as concerns the £5 consumed by the épicier 
himself,  the old rule still prevails. He buys with it a commodity 
value of £1 iU, which he himself consumes, however. [XVII-1043] 
It is different with the other  £7s/4. 
This is wrong. We assume that he always adds 5% to the capital, 
hence the capital is 100, 105, 110,133 etc. For him to accumulate 
this, to apply it as capital, the workers need to buy more from 
him, the capitalist must therefore buy more labour4 (whether by 
employing more workers, or by having to pay more because more 
work is done. Here we leave out of account any rise in the market 
price, although this amounts to the same thing for the circulation 
of money. Similarly, the production price of the commodity could 
have risen, hence either more labour is employed by the capitalist 
in order to produce the same amount of commodities, or the raw 
material, etc., has become dearer. We are not considering any of 
these CASES here. It is assumed that commodity values remain the 
same.) The mere accumulation of the SHOp[keeper], so  FAR as it is not 
SPEND  OF HIS PROFIT, is not of the slightest use to him in accumulating 
as capital the money saved, if the workers do not have any more 
to buy. And we are assuming that this is his  LINE  OF BUSINESS,  and we 
leave out of account here the competition through which one 
SHOPKEEPER  extends his sphere of action at the expense of another. 
(This is a very important consideration in dealing with the 
competition of capitals.67 Here one of the SHOpfkeepers] represents 
the class of SHOpfkeepers].) It is admittedly possible that he e.g. 

=====第190页=====
180 Capital and Profit 
expands his  SHOP,  etc., and maintains a larger service personnel. 
This already requires a considerable increase in the accumulation 
of his capital (or RATHER his LATENT  CAPITAL).  It therefore only comes 
about in consequence of a long (productive) accumulation or 
growth of latent capital. 
But let us assume that the workers buy more and that the 
shopkeeper's accumulation corresponds exactly to the growth in 
wages (hence to the growth in the reproduction of the variable 
capital of the capitalist). (If the latter "were to proceed more 
rapidly, he would have to take credit from the capitalist. His profit 
would then grow more rapidly than his capital.) 
Let us say that this process takes up e.g. 5 years. 
Year I) Capital 100. SHOPfkeeper] buys from the capitalist for 
£100 commodities of the value of £110. Capital pays £110 in 
wages. The workers buy commodities from the SHOPfkeeper] to the 
value of £110. 
//If the situation is normal, the worker, like anyone else, buys 
the commodities at their value. They are only dearer for him 
because he provides more labour for the money with which he 
buys them than the money represents; not because the commodity 
is worth less in money than it costs him. The money costs him 
more labour than it is worth.// 
II) Capital 105. SHOPfkeeper] buys from capital for £110 (hence 
commodities to the value of .£121). But he only has in his shop 
commodities for £105, hence to the value of £115'/2- He consumes 
commodities to the value of £51/%, which cost him £5. (The 1/s is 
10% on 5.) The capitalist pays £115'/2 in wages, with which the 
workers buy from the sHOp[keeper] a commodity value of £115'/2. 
III) Capital 110. SHOPfkeeper] buys commodities from capital for 
£11572. hence commodities of the value of £1261/2+1/2o, or 
£126n/2o- But he has in his shop only £110 of commodities, 
consumes therefore a commodity value of £5n/2o- The value of 
these commodities, for which he has laid out £110, is 121. The 
capitalist pays £121 in wages. The workers buy commodities from 
the SHOPfkeeper] for £121. 
IV) Capital 115. SHOPfkeeper] buys from capital for £121 =a 
commodity value of £132'/io- But he only has in his SHOP 
commodities for 115, the value of which is 126'/2- He therefore 
consumes a commodity value of 66/io- The capitalist pays £126'/2 
to the workers; they buy with this commodities which cost the 
SHop[keeper] 115. 
[XVII-1044] V) Capital 120. SHOP[keeper] buys from the capitalist 
for £126'/2- But he only has enough in his SHOP for £120. He 

=====第191页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 181 
therefore consumes £6V2=a commodity value of 
6+ k+ /10+ /20 = 6+ /20+ /20+ /20 = 6+ /20 = 6 /10. 
He has in his  SHOP  commodities for £120, hence a value of £132. 
The capitalist pays £132 to the workers; they buy for this amount 
from the SHOpfkeeper], etc. 
Two things are assumed here for the sHopfkeeper] to be able to 
add 5% to his capital every year. Firstly, that the individual CON­
SUMPTION OF the sHOp[keeper] himself grows somewhat every year. 
Otherwise the accumulation would have to proceed more rapidly. 
Secondly, that the capitalist (this is what we call the directly 
productive capitalist xaT'é£ox ,nva) accumulates, since this is demon­
strated in the growing magnitude of his variable capital, i.e. the 
annual growth in his outlay for the purchase of labour. But we see 
here at the same time that though the circulation of £100 was 
enough as long as the SHOpfkeeper] did not accumulate but 
consumed his £10 of profit in commodities, this is no longer the 
case once he begins to accumulate. Just as at the beginning of the 
process he bought for £90 10/n and sold for £100, the capitalist 
therefore having to add £9'/n to circulation, but the £100 being 
sufficient, so now at the beginning of each year the capitalist has 
to make an addition to circulation from his own capital in order to 
keep reproduction going. 
Year I) SHOPKEEPER operates with £100. Capital pays wages of 
£110.  Therefore throws £10 more money into circulation. 
Year II) SHOPKEEPER operates with £105. Capital pays wages of 
115  1/2- Throws £5  V2 more money into circulation. 
Year III) SHOPKEEPER operates with £110. Capital pays wages of 
£121.  Therefore throws £5  V2 more money into circulation. 
(1151/2+51/2=120+2/2=121.) 
Year IV) SHOPKEEPER operates with £115.133 Capital pays wages of 
£126 lli. Therefore throws £5  V2 more into circulation. 
Year V) SHOPKEEPER operates with £120. Capital pays £132. 
Throws £5  V2 more into action.134 
The total amount the capitalist has added to circulation over the 
five years=£10+4(5 + 72)=10+20+4/2=£32. This amount replaces 
the whole of the SHOPKEEPER'S profit, because he consumes part of it 
in the commodities of the capitalist, hence sells it to  himself. 
Incidentally, the eventual upshot of all this is the law we 
developed earlier. The wage of the worker pays the whole capital 
of the SHOP[keeper] as well as his profit. Therefore, if a SHOpfkeeper] 
who only provides the workers with the means of subsistence, i.e. 
a Par excellence.— Ed. 
13-613 

=====第192页=====
182 Capital and Profit 
is only sustained by variable capital, accumulates, the money laid 
out for wages must increase. In fact the causal relation is reversed. 
The sHOp[keeper] can only accumulate as sHOp[keeper] (i.e. reconvert 
into CAPITAL his profit in his BUSINESS) if productive capital produces 
on an expanded scale, and only in so far as this expansion involves 
an expansion of variable capital, i.e. capital laid out in wages. The 
expansion of circulation — to the DEGREE of the SHOp[keeper]'s 
ACCUMULATION  — must then be provided by capital. 
Now take the second case. The sHOp[keeper] has no opportunity to 
expand his business, because the capital laid out in the purchase of 
labour does not increase, or does not increase in the proportion to 
which the sHOp[keeper] would like to accumulate. 
If e.g. his capital is 100, the value of the commodities he buys is 
110, and if he consumes half of the 10, he will accumulate £25 in 
the 5 years; if his capital=  1,000,  he will accumulate £250. Thus 
the accumulation of capital appears here at first as accumulation 
of money, WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE than HOARDING, although here the 
hoard has the character of latent capital. All surplus value which is 
realised in money assumes this form initially, until it has been 
reconverted into productive capital. The latent capital may also 
have other forms, those of fixed capital, etc. But then—with the 
exception of unsold commodities destined for individual consump­
tion (apart from the means of subsistence for the workers)—it 
already exists as a condition of production, realised (not in the 
money form) and available. 
[XVII-1045] This accumulation of capital in the form of money 
is however the sole kind which can take place without the 
presupposition of simultaneous reproduction in other spheres of 
productive capital. This SHOPKEEPER can thus be compelled to HOARD 
the £250 as money, because there is no growth in variable capital. 
This lack of growth does not prevent him from setting aside 
annually £5 of money, or more, depending on his greed or mania 
for accumulation, which he cannot however directly apply as 
capital in his business. This is an incidental feature of the 
reproduction process which is important for the explanation of 
many phenomena. 
Under the circumstances we have indicated, the SHOP[keeper] buys 
from capital: 
1st year for £100. Capital has to throw £110 into circulation. 
Thus £10 more than it receives from the sHOP[keeper]. 
2nd year for £105. Namely £100 for SHOP and £5 for SHOPKEEPER. 
The SHOPKEEPER accumulates or RATHER HOARDS £5. Capital has as 
before to throw £110 into circulation. The sHOp[keeper] for the £5 

=====第193页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 183 
receives £5  V2 of commodities in natura. But for the £100 he 
receives a value in commodities of £110, which the capitalist has to 
pay his workers as wages. But since he receives £105 from the 
SHOp[keeper] he has to add 5. 
3rd year the same. 4th year the same. 5th year the same. 
The capitalist has therefore to add to circulation in the first 
year 10, in the 4 following years £20 (each year 5), in the 5 years 
£30.  It was £32, while the sHop[keeper], instead of putting the £5 
into the bank (in short laying it aside), invested it productively in 
the purchase of capital's commodities. It is therefore—prima 
facie—almost the same CASE, quoad circulationem," as if the 
SHop[keeper] had accumulated productively. 
Given the capitalist mode of production, however, it is to be 
assumed that the SHOP[keeper] deposits this amount every year with 
a banker. Whether or not he draws interest from this is here 
irrelevant. Yet it would need to be considered for reproduction as 
a whole. This much is clear, however, that the amount the 
SHOP[keeper] puts aside in this case=the amount capital has to add 
every year over the 5 years—£5. The sHOp[keeper] first puts aside 
£5 at the end of the first year, hence £25 over the 5 years. In the 
first year capital throws £10 into circulation. But 5 out of this 
10 remains in circulation or returns to it from the SHOpfkeeper]. 
With the exception of the £10 which the capitalist casts into 
circulation in the first year, he continues to throw in no more than 
5 a year, since the other 5 remains in circulation. Since the 
105 remains in circulation (the capitalist has thrown in the 5 once 
and for all) there remains to be added by the capitalist over the 
5 years, after the deduction of this amount—and it is in 
circulation, flows back—only £25, exactly the same amount the 
sHop[keeper] has lying in the bank. This money — capital lying 
fallow, accumulating latent money capital for the sHOp[keeper] — 
forms the source of the supplement capital needs for the 
circulation. Thus the circulation can last year by year with the sum 
of £110. The profit of the épicier is verbalement  PAID to him  IN HIS 
OWN  COIN. He himself puts back £105 a year, and £5 is paid to him 
in his money which he has deposited with the BANKER. (It is 
assumed here that he himself receives no interest; otherwise an 
increase of circulation from one direction or another would be 
necessary.) The capitalist pays him his annual balance of £5 with 
his £5 annually deposited with the BANKER. The business is now 
done in the following way: 
a From the standpoint of circulation.— Ed. 
b Literally.— Ed. 
13* 

=====第194页=====
184 Capital and Profit 
First year. Capitalist receives £100 from épicier. Pays 110 to 
workers, who buy commodities from the épicier with this money. 
The épicier pays 105 and takes 5 to the banker. 
Second year. Capitalist receives £105 from épicier (5 of which is 
thrown into circulation by capital). He takes from the BANKER the 5 
which the épicier has deposited. He pays the workers £110. Back 
to the épicier. The latter brings to the banker the same £5, which 
have been returned to him in the £110. 
Third year. Capitalist receives £105 from the épicier. He takes the 
£5 from the banker and pays it to the épicier for the second time, 
in the 4th year for the 3rd time, in the 5th year for the 4th time. 
The £25 deposited with the BANKER by the épicier therefore 
continues to exist only in the form of £5. And in fact the capitalist 
threw £10 into circulation only at the beginning of the transaction; 
this £10 passes through the same cycle just as before. Out of the 
£25,  therefore, only £5 is to be found with the BANKER as money 
accumulated and constantly expended by the capitalist; this £5 
constantly travels from the banker to the capitalist and from the 
[XVII-1046] épicier to the banker. Only by an indirect route does 
the épicier annually throw £110 into circulation. His capital of £25 
deposited with the BANKER amounts to his having a balance of £25 
in his favour with the BANKER, which is present (in so far as the 
BANKER deals at all with his own capital) in the form of SECURITIES, 
mere drafts on future income, government stocks, bills of 
exchange, share certificates, etc. What has accumulated here in 
fact is the épicier's draft on the BANKER, the BANKER'S draft on the 
future receipts of the state, share companies, productive capitals. 
The accumulation is IN FACT here an accumulation of mere drafts 
on receipts which derive from productive capital. (For the revenue 
of the state can also be reduced to receipts of this kind, which are 
paid to it annually by the productive capitalists.) This discussion 
belongs actually to the credit system. 67 What is important here is 
that we should see how the £110 continues to suffice for the 
circulation, although £25 is accumulated as latent money capital One 
can see from this the difference between actual (apparent) 
accumulation of money and the inflow of CURRENCY. What must be 
accumulated here in CURRENCY is nothing but the identical original 
£110,  although the SHOp[keeper] annually withdraws £5 of this from 
circulation. 
//Even if the sHOP[keeper] accumulates productively, and annually 
buys £5 more of commodities from the capitalist, the latter 
receives the extra amount from the BANKER in the same way. Yet in 
this case circulation increases by the whole amount of money the 

=====第195页=====

sHOpfkeeper] does not consume in commodity value, as his purchas­
ing money. The capitalist must obtain from other sources the 
increased wages over and above this purchasing money.// The 
capitalist indeed owes the banker capital (value) to the value of £5 
each time, for the £5 he withdraws annually in this way. Hence at 
the end of the 5th year £25. But this is definitely not the same as 
saying that he has as a result of this changed the figures in his 
account with the BANKER. If, e.g., he has increased his constant, 
without increasing his variable, capital, he will have more to 
receive from the BANKER (who administers his account for him) for 
the sale of his commodities. We do not say, therefore, that he 
borrows the £25. To be sure, he must lay out £5 more of his 
capital every year in money. But for this it is not necessary that 
the amount of  CURRENCY  he himself provides via the SHOpfkeeper] be 
increased. 
With regard to the MERCHANT (épicier, SHOPKEEPER) who sells the 
means of subsistence to the workers—with regard to a part of the 
capital (part of the  MERCANTILE  CAPITAL)—we have seen, thus, how he 
constantly "extracts from circulation more money than he throws 
in". He extracts a part of the "surplus value" in "commodity value", 
but this must be a  GENERAL  LAW,  since all those who live off profit 
//interest and rent// must expend a PART for their individual 
consumption. It is enough for the operation that the amount of 
money necessary to pay the worker his weekly wage should 
circulate, hence the amount necessary to pay for the commodity 
values the worker consumes. The money necessary for this 
circulation is provided (and forms a part of the capital) from the 
capital of the SHOPKEEPER himself for the most part (unless he is 
trading on credit from the MANUFACTURER). The part originally 
provided by the productive capitalist himself=the profit of the 
SHOPKEEPER,  i.e. it is not equal to the annual profit on his capital, 
but=the part of the profit which falls on the weekly turnover. (In 
fact the excess contains not only profit but at the same time the 
depreciation of the capital laid out for the circulation costs.) Let us 
assume that the SHOpfkeeper] circulates £1,000, which turn over 
4 times in the year. And the profit (including costs, etc.)=16%. 
Thus 4% in three months and 4/3% in 1 month, and in one week 
4/i2=7s%-  (4% in 3 months on 1,000=£40. And in 
12 months=£160. And 16% annually on £1,000=£160.) This 
would be a weekly addition of 7s % to  1,000.  To £100 it is £'/s. To 
£300 it is 3x£73=£l- To £900 it is £3. And to £1,000 it is £3 7s 
or £3 62/sS. And this would be the amount the manufacturer had 
to add to the  CURRENCY  of £1,000. (Naturally all these amounts must

in reality be set somewhat higher, because the  REFLUX  movement 
does not proceed without friction. A part of the wage, for 
example, may run into other channels, may be HOARDED by the 
worker, etc. On the other hand, we are leaving almost entirely out 
of account compensations for credit.) We have seen how [XVII-
1047] this amount remains constant, if on the one hand wages (and 
the number of workers employed) remain the same, and on the 
other hand the épicier consumes the whole of his profit in the 
commodities of the capitalist. It is not greatly modified when the 
SHop[keeper] WITHDRAWS PART OF HIS PROFIT. If the épicier accumulates 
productively, i.e. expands his business, the prerequisite is that the 
variable capital employed by the capitalist should increase. In this 
case too, what the capitalist adds is only equal to the profit, or 
RATHER  the weekly expression of the profit, of the tenant. a A very small 
rate,  therefore. Incidentally, see the following 
11 Note to P. 1044} 
The calculation is wrong, because it is always only the part of 
the SHOPKEEPER'S money with which he operates as capital which is 
calculated, thus not the money he expends for his own consump­
tion, the money he expends as income. Then matters proceed in 
this way: 
Year I. SHOPKEEPER buys with £100 for his  SHOP  a commodity value

money into the circulation, or is the starting point as well as the 
returning point of the circulation?* 
With the épicier the capitalist has only to throw once and for all 
into circulation—if the reproduction process remains the same 
and the épicier consumes the whole of his profit—the part=the 
weekly expression of the profit of the MERCANTILE capital of the 
épicier. This addition to the capital thrown into circulation every 
week by the épicier himself //we can look later at the differences 
which enter through the fact that the épicier buys perhaps only 
once a month or once every 3 months, depending on the 
circumstances, and sells weekly//+the weekly monetary expression 
of this capital itself is then sufficient for the épicier to be able to 
withdraw every week from circulation e.g. £10 more than he 
threw into it, although the weekly CURRENCY remains £110, as 
before. And what the capitalist has thrown in, ONCE and  FOR  ALL, is 
only Vu of the weekly expression of his variable capital, hence, 
since the weekly variable capital =1/52 of the annual variable capital, 
Vu of this, ='/s72 of the variable capital he has to lay out 
52 x 11 
annually. Whether I pay 1,200 thalers (value) all together at the 
end of the year, or 12 thalers a month or 3 thalers a week, 
changes nothing in the amount of value I have to pay for the whole 
year. In the first case, however, 1,200 thalers of money would be 
needed to realise the value. In the second, if the 3 thalers flow 
back, they may be sufficient to pay the 1,200 thalers. 3 thalers, 
turning over 400 times in the year, realise  1,200.  But one sees at 
the same time that important as the above investigation is for the 
role played by mercantile capital in relation to the circulation of 
money proceeding during the reproduction process, the question 
is not thereby exhausted. This is so in two respects. 
1) Since mercantile capital is itself PART and  PARCEL  OF THE CAPITAL, 
one should, to begin with, refer it to productive capital  itself.  The 
operation would then look like this: The capitalist pays out 110 in 
wages, the workers buy back from him commodities of 110, and 
the money thus flows back to him. This shows us indeed how a 
money capital of 110, laid out weekly (in money as CURRENCY, means 
of payment), is enough if he has to lay out a variable capital 
annually to the amount of £5,720. The workers receive from him 
in the course of the year a commodity value of £5,720. But the 
sum of £110 is sufficient to pay them this over the whole year. 
The simple circuit of the money is only that the same coin passes 
through different hands. In contrast to this, the REFLUX move-

=====第198页=====
188 Capital and Profit 
ment —continuity—implies [XVII-1048] that the same coin or ar 
least the same amount of money passes again and again through 
the same hands as means of purchase or payment. Hence the 
money capital the capitalist must have in order to pay his variable 
capital to the workers is in no way proportionate to the size of this 
variable capital  itself.  Although the weekly expression in money of 
the variable capital for the 2 variable capitals A and B is naturally 
proportionate to the magnitudes of A and B. If A is 50 times 
greater than B, its weekly expression in money is 50 times greater 
than that of B. In either case this is quite compatible with the 
MONETARY expression of A and B over the whole year never being, 
respectively, greater than A/52 and B/52. This is an important 
moment in the REFLUX movement, in order to grasp the mechanism 
of the circulation of money. But whether the capitalist pays out 
£110 at the end of the week or  5,720  at the end of the year, this 
movement does not explain how even a centime of profit flows 
back to him, hence also profit realised as money. For, reduced to a 
still simpler expression, the process comes down to this: He first 
pays out the amount in money; he then pays out the same amount 
of value in commodities and thus draws back the money. It is 
reduced to this, that every week he pays out a value of £110 to the 
workers. No advantage results from this process of payment. And 
not in the least from the fact that he first gives out the tokens (the 
money) and then draws them back and gives out the real 
commodity values. 
2) But secondly, with regard to the MERCANTILE CAPITAL of the 
SHOPKEEPER, the matter can be reduced to this: His specific profit 
requires merely that the value of the commodity sold by him 
should be paid; and, since the workers are the buyers of his 
commodity, that the wage of labour should=the value of the 
commodities sold to them by him. But expressing this generally we 
find that the problem itself is only repeated (leaving aside the 
SPECIFIC NATURE OF MERCANTILE CAPITAL) IN ANOTHER  FORM:  Expressed gener­
ally this means nothing but: for the capitalist to draw from 
circulation more money than he has thrown into it nothing more 
is needed except that the value of his commodities should be paid 
for, or that enough money should be there to pay for the value of 
his commodities. Or that enough money should be available every 
week, i.e. that enough money should periodically circulate, to pay 
for the periodically circulating amount of commodities that he 
offers for sale. But since the value of his commodities includes 
surplus value (profit (interest, rent)), hence he has given out less 
money in order to buy the elements of the commodity, it means 

=====第199页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 189 
that so much money is (periodically) in circulation as to enable him 
periodically to withdraw from circulation more money than he has 
thrown in. This solution of the QUESTION, generalised, is therefore 
nothing more than a repetition of the QUESTION  itself. 
We must above all endeavour TO REDUCE THE PROBLEM ITSELF TO ITS 
SIMPLEST EXPRESSION. 
The fact that the capitalist receives back more value than he 
gives out is not what constitutes the question. For this would be 
the question of the origin of surplus value, which we have already 
solved. Therefore, what is at stake here is the question of how this surplus 
value is realised in circulation. In the first act of capital, M—C, it 
buys commodities to which, as shown above, surplus value is 
added in the production process, i.e. value the capitalist 
has not paid for but which he can sell. In the second process, 
C—M, in contrast, in the sale of the reproduced commodities, the 
capitalist in fact throws into circulation more value than he has 
withdrawn from it in M—C. The only requirement for the 
realisation of this higher value is that it should find an equivalent 
in circulation. We have discussed how this happens, in investigat­
ing the way in which, in the total reproduction process, the use 
values and values of the different capitals replace, pay for, and 
realise each other. 135 Hence this too is not the problem. In 
explaining that process we made abstraction from the circulation 
of money, or we considered money only as the expression of 
value, as money of account. The question was therefore then 
posed in this way: Assuming the product is  sold,  how is it replaced? 
Or, on the other hand, who buys it, who  possesses  the values needed to 
replace it? The question is now related to the money with which the 
purchase is conducted. Capital's extraction from the circulation 
process of a greater commodity value than it originally threw in is 
explained by the fact that it throws in the surplus in one form, 
before it extracts it in the other form. And the way it throws in 
the surplus in advance in the other form has been explained. 
[XVII-1049] But the question here is: How is the surplus 
realised in money? How does the surplus value assume the form 
of a surplus of money? The money the capitalist lays out at the 
beginning of the process does not enter into the production 
process. The capitalist rather gives it away entirely. The fact that 
he has given it away is a condition for the initiation of the actual 
production process. Hence whatever increase of value occurs in 
the production process, the value which was originally represented 
by money increases, but this increase of value changes absolutely 
nothing in the quantity of money. It itself is present in circulation 

=====第200页=====
190 Capital and Profit 
in the same quantity, before and after the production process. It 
has changed hands. If now through the circuit of reproduction it 
flows back into the hands of the capitalist, how should it flow back 
in increased quantity? Let us say the total productive 
capital=  1,000,  and there were commodities of that amount in the 
hands of the MERCHANT. WELL. The commodities are now partly 
present in the productive process, and are partly being consumed 
by the workers. The £1,000, in contrast, is now in the hands of 
the MERCHANT. Once the production process has ended, commodities 
to the value of 1,100 ought to be found in the hands of the 
productive capitalist. How is the MERCHANT to buy commodities to 
the value of £1,100 with £1,000? It is of no assistance to shift the 
question from one foot to the other and to say: the MERCHANT sells 
the commodities to the consumers for £1,100. Who are the 
consumers? The industrial consumers and the individual consum­
ers. Industrial consumers are the capitalist himself and the 
workers. But they only buy back when the £1,000 has been 
converted into  1,100.  Individual consumers—profit (interest, rent) 
and RETAINERS. But this profit and its branches—interest, rent and 
the salaries of the unproductive workers—have first to be realised. 
They are contained precisely in the £100. One therefore says in 
fact that the capitalist pays the merchant the 100, so that the latter 
can pay him £1,100 for commodities of a value of  1,100,  since the 
merchant only possesses £1,000 from the previous operation. 
So BROADLY PUT, the question answers  itself.  In the form in which 
the problem is posed, money is only considered in circulation, 
excluded from the production process. //We disregard here credit 
money, in which circulation itself functions as the workshop for 
the production of money.// And it is excluded, as money. But not 
as commodity. As the latter, it emerges itself from the production 
process. And the money (gold, silver) is at first a commodity— 
before it runs its course in circulation as money. Let us transfer 
gold and silver production from the gold and silver lands to the 
home country  itself,  so that the entry of foreign trade does not 
bring in superfluous incidental details in advance. To  WORK  A GOLD  OR 
SILVER  MINE,  the capitalist has to lay out constant and variable capital, 
as in every other branch of industry. But his constant capital 
consists only of fixed capital and matières instrumentales? Living 
labour forms a large proportion of the total outlay. Let us assume 
that when he lays out £100 in money, he gains £130. This £30 
then forms the surplus value. ////(Profit and rent) The production

of gold and silver is distinguished from all other branches of 
production by the fact that here, rather than comparing the value 
of the product with the value of the outlay, we must compare the 
money value of the outlay, the  EXPENSES  MONETARILY  EXPRESSED,  with the 
total amount of the product. The outlay,  £100,=A  CERTAIN MASS OF 
GOLD.  Its price of £100 is merely the expression in the language of 
money of account of the fact that the outlay=a certain quantity of 
gold. Hence if the product is 130, i.e. if it contains 3/i0 more gold 
than the outlay, the profit=30%. The rate of profit (which here 
includes rent) is determined purely by the excess of the use value 
obtained (gold) over the outlay (similarly in gold), expressed in the 
same use value, gold. And this is entirely independent of the value 
of the gold. An equalisation of the profit can here only take place 
to the extent that if the rate of profit=10% and the excess of 
gold=30, this 30 may be split up into rent and profit. On the 
other hand, the outlay itself depends, to be sure, on the value of 
the gold, hence on the productivity of the labour employed in the 
production of gold and silver—a productivity which is determined 
by the natural level of yield of the mine, if the mode of 
production is given, and which depends on the mode of 
production if the natural level of yield is given. If the value of 
gold and silver stands high, because the mines yield little //We 
want to leave aside the mode of production here, although it is 
important for SURPLUS value, as in every other TRADE; the capitalist 
[XVII-1050] can extract more surplus labour if he employs 
division of labour, machinery, etc.// and therefore a large quantity 
of labour provides a meagre result, £20 may perhaps buy as much 
labour (i.e. means of subsistence for the workers), instruments and 
matières instrumentales as in another situation 100. If, therefore, 
£100 is invested and yields a  SURPLUS  PRODUCE  of only £3, the rate of 
profit will admittedly only be 3%. But as much can be bought with 
this £3 as with £30 in the other case.//// 
Or the surplus labour is expressed in £30. Let us assume that 
the capital consists of 40 constant capital and 60 variable capital, 
i.e. £60 laid out in wages. In this case the £100 thrown into 
circulation comes out of the production process itself as gold and 
silver to the value of £130. The whole of the capital does not need 
first to be converted into gold or silver by the circulation process, 
but is converted into gold or silver in natura. The first 
metamorphosis here is not the conversion of the commodity into 
gold or silver (money) but inversely the conversion of gold and 
silver into commodity. Gold and silver are only realised as 
commodities and converted into money through their exchange

192 Capital and Profit 
with other commodities. Our gold producer would d'abord have 
had to pay out 6/is of his product to the workers. The REFLUX of this 
6/is or £60 would not take place with him. The workers buy from 
the SHOPKEEPER with it, but the SHOPKEEPER does not have to buy from 
the gold producer with the £60, which is gold. He rather expends 
£60 in order to buy commodities from the capitalist who produces 
means of subsistence. The £60 therefore flows towards the latter. 
(The profit of the  SHOPKEEPER  continues to consist in his receiving 
from the capitalist for the £60 a commodity value of say £66 
(10%).  Whereas he himself naturally only gives out commodities to 
the value of £60 for the £60.) And the £30 is reconverted by the 
gold producer into machinery, matières instrumentales, etc.; they 
therefore flow to the machine manufacturer, coal producer, etc. 
Finally, profit and rent of £30 is in part consumed, whether in 
means of subsistence and luxuries or by being handed to 
unproductive workers (the state, servants, etc.); and a part of it is 
destined for accumulation, therefore thrown onto the loan market. 
As long as it is not loaned out, it lies idle as a hoard. Once it is 
loaned out, it is itself again laid out in constant capital and variable 
capital and thus thrown into circulation. The gold which the gold 
producer has thus thrown into circulation flows back to him from 
circulation only in the form of the commodity; it returns to him 
(with surplus) out of his own sphere of production as gold and 
silver. Thus the £130 of new gold flow as money into circulation, 
partly in exchange for means of subsistence, it may be for the 
workers, it may be for the other classes, partly in exchange for 
machinery and matières instrumentales. This commodity, unlike all 
others, does not have to be converted into money, but becomes 
money through its conversion into a commodity; it therefore 
performs the opposite movement to that performed by the other 
commodities. If on the one hand a SURPLUS of commodity values is 
thrown into circulation, on the other hand a surplus of gold is 
thrown in. This is on the assumption that there exists a circulation 
adequate to begin the new cycle of the reproduction process. On 
the same assumption, all that needs to be circulated anew, is 
surplus value. From the other angle, the angle of gold production, 
it is not only the surplus (the £30), which is thrown into 
circulation but the whole product (with the exception of the 
accumulated gold, as long as it lies idle). Thus on the above 
assumption, 2 if e.g. the capital consists of 1,000 and the profit of 
100 (the total SURPLUS VALUE), all that needs to be thrown into 
a See this volume, pp.  189-91.—  Ed. 

=====第203页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 193 
circulation is gold for £100. Thus a capital of 715/i3 would suffice 
for gold production. For the product equals 100. (Profit 288/13.) 
Relatively little capital suffices here because it is not the surplus of 
this capital but capital and profit—the total product in which it is 
reproduced—which is expended in paying for that surplus of 
commodity values. 
The whole of the portion of annual production which is 
exchanged for gold or silver (this is how the matter presents itself 
when gold and silver are not produced within the country) or 
directly employed in the production of gold and silver, 1) repre­
sents more gold or silver than is expended to produce it; it 
represents SURPLUS value directly in gold or silver, as a surplus of 
gold and silver; 2) reproduces in gold or silver the whole of the 
capital laid out. This gold (let us leave out silver to simplify 
matters), in so far as it enters as a material into gold and silver 
manufacturing, is as we have seena also a form of hoard-
formation, which we are not concerned with here. It replaces the 
constant capital of the jeweller,  GOLDSMITH,  watchmaker, etc. 
Another part enters the CURRENCY, whether to replace worn out, 
[XVI I-1051] abraded coins, or because the realisation of the 
commodity values requires a greater QUANTITY OF CURRENCY. A third 
part becomes a hoard, and in this form it is either a mere hoard 
(capital lying idle) or a reserve fund for means of payment and 
purchase, or, finally, for the settlement of international balances, 
or a means of purchase abroad. As BULLION, gold can only serve as 
means of payment on the world market; within the country it 
must be converted into actual coin or at least transferred into 
money of account. 
According to our assumption, gold production takes place 
within the country. 
The gold producer has to exchange his product 1) for variable 
capital by means of the wage paid to the workers; 2) for constant 
capital, for machinery and matières instrumentales; 3) for means of 
subsistence, etc., in which PROFIT (RENT  INCLUDED)  ISSPENDED [expended]; 
4) a part of the profit is accumulated. If this accumulation is not 
to be mere HOARDING, it must in turn be laid out as variable and 
constant capital. 
Let us start from 4); the part of the newly produced gold which 
is accumulated as profit. It must either BE HOARDED, if there is no 
direct employment for it, or, if there is employment for it, it

replaces constant and variable capital. If the latter takes place, the 
gold producer may either invest it in his own business or loan it 
out as interest-bearing capital. As far as the first is concerned, the 
gold producer has it in common with all other producers whose 
SURPLUS is realised in money that it is initially a hoard which lies 
idle, latent money capital. As such it lies with the banker, and 
waits for its conversion into productive capital. The sole difference 
is that in the one case it can exist in the form of tokens of value 
(government stocks) or as banknotes or some other form of credit 
money, but here it exists itself as value, i.e. money. The second 
case is as follows: He accumulates, i.e. capitalises the profit existing 
as a  SURPLUS  of gold. This happens either through his investing it in 
his own business or loaning it out. 
Let us assume that he invests it in his own business. Then, in 
this particular case, his accumulation will be different from that of 
the other capitalists. The other capitalists can only employ their 
own product again as a condition of production if it really enters 
as a condition of production into their own product. E.g. coal 
enters into coal production, machines enter into machine produc­
tion, metal enters into metal production, corn enters into corn 
production. But they can never do more than reproduce it in 
natura as constant capital. One might refer to the producers of 
means of subsistence which can be stored; e.g. living cattle, corn, 
clothes, etc., are variable capital which is accumulated in natura. 
But cattle-breeders,  FARMERS,  CLOTHIERS, etc., must all first sell cattle, 
corn, clothes before they can pay the workers with them. The 
wage must be paid in money. They indeed accumulate,  TO A CERTAIN 
DEGREE (no one produces means of subsistence to pile them up; the 
capitalist produces at most the excess quantity he  THINKS  TO BE ABLE  TO 
SELL WITHIN THE YEAR, basing his calculations on THE GENERAL OVERPRO­
DUCTION  AS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR PAST), variable capital  FOR  THE SOCIETY, 
but not directly for themselves. Apart from this, every particular 
branch of production produces ONLY ONE ITEM OF THE VARIABLE CAPITAL, 
AND CAN ONLY BY ITS CONVERSION INTO MONEY BE RECONVERTED INTO ALL THE 
INGREDIENTS OF VARIABLE CAPITAL. The gold producer, in contrast, can 
never reproduce in natura any part of his constant capital. Gold 
is neither instrument, nor matière instrumentale for the production 
of gold. It does not enter into the production of gold in 
natura. But the gold producer, unlike the other producers, can 
directly reproduce his variable capital, i.e. the variable capital in 
its direct form, gold paid to the workers as wages. For the worker 
to be able to realise this gold there must admittedly be the com­
modities on the market into which, as means of subsistence, he 

=====第205页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 195 
sinks his wages. (For society it is variable capital which the pro­
ducers of variable capital can accumulate, i.e. a commodity; but 
not this commodity in the form in which it serves them them­
selves directly as variable capital. Conditions of production and 
commodities which belong to the consumption fund of society 
can BE ACCUMULATED, the former TO A GREATER, THE LATTER TO A SMALLER 
DEGREE.) This gold paid to the workers would go directly into 
circulation. The more workers were employed, the more gold 
could circulate, and more gold would have to circulate, SINCE 
THE WORKMEN ARE TO BE PAID CONTEMPORANEOUSLY AT A GIVEN PERIOD. But here 
A DIFFERENCE comes in. What he has to advance for  CIRCULATION  is 
the weekly  MONETARY  EXPRESSION  OF THE NEW VARIABLE CAPITAL HE IS TO 
DISPENSE  DURING THE YEAR. What he must pay is THAT  MONETARY  EXPRES­
SION  OF ONE  WEEK  x52. The matter proceeds in this way. He employs 
e.g. 10 more workers a year, SAY=£520. THIS IS £1 WEEKLY per 
worker or £10 for 10 workers. [XVII-1052] But he has to lay 
out this £10 every week, since the outlay flows back to him not 
as money but as commodity. The épicier receives the £10, buys a 
commodity from the manufacturer for it. If the circulation was 
previously 100—I mean this circulation between the manufacturer, 
épicier and WORKMEN—it  is now 110. The manufacturer continues to 
receive the £100 he EXPENDS FOR HIS OWN WORKMEN, REPLACED BY THE 
épicier; he receives further, replaced by him, the £10 the gold 
producer SPENDS for his WORKMEN. The épicier makes his profit on 
the £10 as on the 100. He sells the workers for £10 commodities 
of the value of £10, but they only cost him £ 10/n or 182 /nS., if his 
profit on 100=10% (it is however much less on account of the 
turnover of the capital). The épicier therefore pays the manufac­
turer 110 the first week. But the manufacturer only pays his 
workers 100. Hence the £10 the gold producer threw into 
circulation does not flow back into this circulation between worker 
and épicier. But the épicier must now buy £110 worth a week from 
the manufacturer. Every week he receives from the workers who 
produce gold this addition of £10 for circulation. Nevertheless 
only £110 circulates every week. Therefore, out of the £520 the 
gold producer has laid out in additional labour during the year, 
no more than £10 enters into the circulation between the 
manufacturer and the SHOPKEEPER. The basic sum of 510 is money 
which has replaced the capital of the manufacturer, i.e. com­
modities to this amount, in which capital and profit are both 
included. Assume that the SHOPKEEPER, who has to buy Vu more 
from the manufacturer, bought in the 2nd week £110 worth, 
before he received the £10 from the gold producer's workers, that 

=====第206页=====
196 Capital  and  Profit 
he therefore advanced  the £10  from  his own  capital. Thus  the 
manufacturer lays aside  £10  (within this circulation), since  he only 
has to pay 100 to his own  workers.  In the 2nd  week,  the  épicier 
receives £110,  100  from  the  manufacturer's workers,  10 from  the 
gold producer's workers.  But he  already possesses commodities  for 
£110 (deducting what  he  keeps  for  himself).  To the  manufac­
turer's workers  he gives  £100 in  commodities,  and to the  gold 
producer's workers  he  gives  £10. He  therefore once again  has 
£110. 
The only difference  is this:  If the  épicier  has advanced  the  £10, 
so when  the  cycle  is broken  off he  retains  the £10  which flow  to 
him from  the  gold producer's workers.  If he  paid  the  money from 
his receipts from  the  gold producer's workers,  he has to  hand over 
the £10 to the  manufacturer. 
In any  case, £520 worth  of the  manufacturer's commodities  are 
converted into money.  The  manufacturer pays  the  wage  IN  FACT 
only for the  first week  in money. Later  he  always pays  it in 
commodities.  For the  money form  of his  commodities flows back 
to him  from  the 2nd  week onwards from  the  épicier. Every week 
the gold producer pays  in gold.  But  this gold does  not  enter into 
this circulation,  or only  in his  exchange with  his  workers.  It only 
serves once  as the  workers' means  of payment,  and is  then 
converted  in the  hands  of the  manufacturer into THE  MONETARY 
EXPRESSION  OF THAT PART  OF HIS  CAPITAL WHICH DOES  NOT  in natura ENTER INTO 
THE CONSUMPTION  OF HIS  WORKMEN.  I.e. it is converted into the  MONETARY 
EXPRESSION  (AS FAR AS IT  GOES)  OF THAT PART  OF ITS  PRODUCT WHICH REPRESENTS  HIS 
CONSTANT  CAPITAL  AND HIS  PROFIT.  V52 of the  variable capital  of the  gold 
producer enters into  the  circulating money capital  of the 
SHOPKEEPER,  and  therefore functions  as  CURRENCY  between  the 
sHOp[keeper],  the  manufacturer  and the  WORKMEN,  51/S2.  on the  other 
hand, becomes  the  expression  of the  constant capital  and  profit  of 
the manufacturer. (Here  we  disregard  the  PROFIT  of the  SHOPKEEPER, 
which receives  its  MONETARY  EXPRESSION  in the  51/s2-) 
Let us assume that  the  capital  the  manufacturer  has  laid out is 
£700.  Then  the  gold manufacturer's  10 workers replace £520  for 
him. The £100 of  "circulation"  his  workers cost  him are to be 
found  in the  circuit between  him and the  SHOpfkeeper]. Therefore 
he only  has to  turn into money  a commodity value  of £170 
[XVII-1053]  in order  to realise  the  whole  of his capital,  CAPITAL  and 
profit. Since  his  constant capital=600,  he replaces, with this  520, 
600—520,  the  whole  of his  constant capital except  £80. If the 
profit=10%,  he  therefore  has to  replace  a further  £80 for 
constant capital  and £70 for  profit,=£150.

His constant capital amounts to variable capital+profit for the 
producer of constant capital. If wages again form V7, the variable 
capital amounts to 742/7. And profit=4455/7- If the whole of this is 
given out, £520 flows back to him for commodities, since he 
provides the means of subsistence. And he only has to sell an 
additional £150 worth of commodities. 
This much is clear  d'abord,*  that even the part of the gold 
producer's capital that he lays out in wages does not remain in 
circulation as COIN, but adds at most the MONETARY EXPRESSION OF ONE 
WEEK'S WAGES to this circulation. He pays this part as wages. This is 
the way in which he throws this part into circulation. But it does 
not remain in circulation for the payment of the wage. It is 
converted instead into the money capital of the productive 
capitalist. If, as a result of an increase in the production of gold 
(we do not mean a rise in the productivity of the mines, etc., but a 
growth in the labour and capital invested in gold production), the 
manufacturer increased his own production, hence e.g. in the 
above case b employed 10 more workers (an incorrect proportion: 
if the gold producer employs 10 more workers the manufacturer 
will employ at most one more) the process would be as follows: he 
had to pay £100 in wages to 100 workers, and now he has to pay 
110 for 110 workers. But on our assumption the SHOPKEEPER receives 
£10 a week from the workers of the gold producer. This would be 
the calculation, assuming that the production of the manufacturer 
provided enough commodities for 10 workers in addition to his 
own. 
1st week. SHOPKEEPER receives £10 from gold producer's workers. 
100 from manufacturer's workers. Buys for £110 from the 
manufacturer. Buys with this from the manufacturer commodities 
to the value of £110. Manufacturer pays £100 of this to his 
workers, uses the £10 in some other way. Only £100 flows to the 
épicier from the manufacturer's workers, but 10 flows from the 
gold producer's workers. The first £100 circulates constantly 
within this sphere. The last £10 is constantly thrown afresh into 
this circulation every week, but does not return to it. 
2nd week. Assume that the manufacturer increases his produc­
tion by 10 workers as a result of new demand from the gold 
producer. He therefore pays a wage of £110. The SHOPKEEPER now 
sells for £110 to the manufacturer's workers, for 10 to the gold 
producer's workers. He buys for £120 from the manufacturer. 
But the manufacturer only needs £110 for wages. £10 therefore

flows back. Therefore  if he  increases  his own  variable capital  as a 
result  of an  increase  in gold production,  he only increases—quoad 
circulation—the weekly expression  of his  addition  to variable 
capital.  The  gold  of the  gold producer which flows  to him  afresh 
every  week—BEYOND  THIS  POINT—does  not  flow back  to this section  of 
circulation. 
Let us now  take  the  part  of the  profit which  the  gold producer 
expends  as  INCOME.  Apart from particular expenditures,  he  will 
sometimes  buy  commodities  of  greater value, sometimes  of 
smaller.  For  example, some furniture, jewels,  etc.,  horses, car­
riages,  etc., may  have  a high price,  so that much gold must  be 
expended  at one  time  in the  sale.  But we can  take an average.  For 
10 weeks  he  throws into circulation perhaps  £10,  while  for 2 
weeks  100  each time.  If that  is right,  he would have thrown into 
circulation  in the 12  weeks gold  to the  value  of £1,200. That 
makes  £100  a week. Over  the  year  he throws £1,200  in gold into 
circulation.  But we can  calculate  the  quantity, which remains 
constant  in this circulation between  him, his  SHOPKEEPER  and the 
MANUFACTURER  and  FARMER,  as  ABOUT  £100.  The  remainder, £1,100, 
goes into  the  pockets  of the  manufacturer  and  FARMER  (in part into 
the SHOPKEEPER'S  pockets),  in order  to serve  in another sector  of 
circulation,  or it  lies there  as latent capital.  If production  is 
increased in this way, the  WEEKLY  MONETARY  EXPRESSION  OF THE  WAGES  OF THE 
ADDITIONAL  LABOURERS  must  be added  to this.  The  greater part  of this 
gold is however withdrawn both from  the  circulation between 
SHOPKEEPER,  WORKMEN  and  MANUFACTURER,  and  from  the  circulation 
between  SHOPKEEPER,  MANUFACTURER  AND  GOLD-PRODUCING  [XVII-1054] 
capitalist. 
The 3rd  part  of his  product, finally,  is exchanged  for  constant 
capital, where  it again pays  for  wages (variable capital)  and 
constant capital. Speaking  of the  former, what  we  said previously 
applies. Most  of it is  withdrawn from  the  sphere  of circulation, 
into which  it is  thrown,  and  does  not  return there.  Let us  assume 
it is £110,  and £10 of  this represents  the  profit  of the  producer  of 
the constant capital.  Let l/s of his  outgoings  of £100=labour,43 
hence  £20.  This  £20  does  not  return  to circulation  (or  only  a 
small part  of it for an  increased outlay  in labour).  The £20 
replaces  lU of the  constant capital  in money,  SINCE  8%=20.  70 
remains  to be  replaced profit included.  But the  circulation which 
occurs within  the  sphere  of circulation  of the  exchange  of the 
constant capital  is sufficient  to realise  the  £80.  Of the 20  paid  for 
the variable capital,  a half—10—is sufficient  for the  realisation  of 
the profit.  Of the £100 the  producer  of the  constant capital

Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 199 
receives 90 is therefore superfluous for his circulation. (Or at least 
most of the 90, if he expands his business as a result of the 
demand from the gold producer.) What now happens to this £90? 
To the producer of the constant capital it represents not an 
equivalent for profit but an equivalent for capital. He receives 
back more of the equivalent for his capital in money, an excess 
quantity in money, which he needs in the natural form of his 
capital  as RETURN. 
Let the whole of the annual productive capital consist of 6 
million, i.e. let this be the magnitude of the part of the capital 
which comes onto the market as a commodity and which therefore 
includes the annual depreciation of the constant capital. Assume 
that the variable part of this capital=1/6>=l million. Then all that 
• • ' million 
needs to be circulated for this in money is ——— =19,230. 
This 19,230 in fact circulates 52 times its own value in 
commodities. There therefore remain to be realised 
5 million+19,230. Assume further that the profit (rent 
included)=30%, hence  1,800,000  on the 6 million. Assume that 
this profit is completely consumed. If the capitalists, like the 
workers, were to spend their income roughly immediately in equal 
weekly portions, this would require 34,6156/i3 a week. However, 
on account of the larger occasional and periodic purchases let us 
say 100,000. Then we have ABOUT 119,230 for CURRENCY. For the 
CURRENCY which is expended as profit. This sum replaces not only 
the profit of the producers of the means of subsistence, but their 
variable capital; it replaces not only the profit of the producers of 
constant capital but at the same time their variable capital. Let us 
assume that the proportion of variable to constant capital is in 
general 1:5. This proportion is not displayed exactly in the 
division of the 6 million, because it is merely the depreciation of 
the fixed capital which enters into it, not the fixed capital  itself. 
According to our previous calculation, 2,800,000 of this consists of 
means of subsistence (1 million for replacement of the total 
variable capital of the society, and  1,800,000  for the profit on the 
total capital) and this is circulated on our first calculation by 
£108,334. Since these commodities of 2,800,000 are the product 
of the capitalists who produce the means of subsistence, their total 
product=£2,800,000. This includes their capital advanced+a 
profit of 20%. Hence 1/6 of this amount consists of their profit, 
and the remainder consists of capital advanced. Out of the 
£2,800,000, therefore, 466,6664/6 is profit and 2,333,334 is capital

advanced. The profit these producers consume in their own 
reciprocal commodities, or rather this reciprocal consumption of 
their profit in their reciprocal commodities, may occur in three 
ways.  They may buy simultaneously or on credit from each other. 
In both cases, there is at most a balance to be paid, now from one, 
now from another. Or one may buy today from the other in CASH, 
the other tomorrow in CASH from the former. In this  CASE—the  most 
unfavourable case for the reduction of the CASH present in 
CURRENCY—there  takes place at all events a REFLUX movement of 
money and through this REFLUX movement a circulation of money. 
Here a definite sum of money circulates, and pays many times 
over in the same hands for different portions of commodity value. 
Let us say it passes through each pair of hands 10 times. Thus 
only Vio is needed of the amount that would otherwise be 
necessary to circulate the above profit. Assume that the profit of 
466,333 referred to =74 of the 1,800,000, of which it forms an 
aliquot PART. (It is more than 74-) Then, if a circulation of 
£100,000 is required for £1,800,000, £25,000 is required for 74 of 
that. But this 25,000 should be reduced to a tenth of that amount. 
There therefore remain 75,000+2,500, or £77,500, for the total 
circulation present in profit. Furthermore, if the proportion of 
variable to constant capital in [XVII-1055] this sphere of 
production  =1:5,  the capital of 2,333,334 will be divided into 7s 
variable capital and 4/5 constant. The variable=466,6664/5, say 
466,667, and the constant= 1,866,667. £8,974 is required for the 
circulation of the variable capital, and this is already calculated in 
the circulation of the total variable capital. There remain 
£1,866,667, with which the producers of the means of subsistence 
pay for their constant capital, and with which the workers and 
capitalists employed in the manufacture of the constant capital 
replace their variable capital and realise their profit, in short 
expend wages and profit. 
After deduction of the 2,333,334 which are employed in the 
production of the means of subsistence there remain 3,666,666 of 
the capital of 6 million. £533,333 of this is variable capital (since 
variable capital is 1 million altogether and 466,667 falls to the 
workers in sphere I, that of the production of the means of 
subsistence). There remains a constant capital of 3,133,333. This 
amount, with which the capitalists of sphere II realise their profits 
and their variable capital, is sufficient to allow class I to replace its 
constant capital. £2,500 for profit and £8,974 for wages is 
sufficient for class I (for the circulation within it). So there 
remains for circulation between class I and class II, etc.136

The calculation  SOMEWHAT  ELSE  to TURN. 
//We had a capital of 6 million. 20% profit=  1,800,000.  Hence 
the value of all the commodities in circulation=7,800,000. If 
2,800,000 consist of means of subsistence, a constant capital of 
5,000,000 remains over. (The proportion is greater here because 
only the part of the constant capital which enters as depreciation 
into the commodity enters into the value of the annually 
circulating commodity.)// 
Hence I) £2,800,000. Sphere of the capital employed in the 
production of the means of subsistence. 
Out of these commodities of the value of £2,800,000 20% 
represent  profit—ABOUT  466,667—and the remainder, 
capital= 2,333,333. 388,888 of this capital is variable capital. There 
remains a constant capital of 1,944,445. ls7 
There circulates within this sphere for the variable capital 
!—, of which the weekly MONETARY  expression=ABOUT  7,477 
(7,476 36/52 to be precise). And there circulates for the profit, which 
is on our assumption entirely consumed, say for all expenditure of 
income (which is not wages), Vio of the total amount, which would 
be ABOUT  46,667. But since the consumers of the profit are 
reciprocally dealers in the commodities they consume, a REFLUX 
takes place here. The butcher buys from the baker, and with the 
same money the baker buys from the butcher and the butcher 
again from the baker. Through the REFLUX movement, therefore, 
the same sum of money passes through the same hands. Say this 
turnover takes place 10 times on the average. Then only '/io of the 
previous amount is required to turn the profit into money. There 
therefore remains about £4,666, whereby we have not made any 
attempt to calculate how much of his own commodities the 
SHOPKEEPER,  etc.,  gobbles  up. 
In this sphere, therefore, what is required for circulation within 
it is £7,477 for wages and £4,666 for profit. Taken 
together=£12,143 in money. 
The remaining £1,944,445 worth of commodities of class I are 
sold to class II, the manufacturers of constant capital. 
So now to class II. Its capital, with profit,=a commodity value of 
£50,000,000. Of this, profit=somewhat more than 833,333. Out of 
the 5 million, the  1,944,445  replace the part of the product which 
consists of wages and profit; wages thus=l,lll,112. In order to 
pay these wages, '— is needed, =£21,367. And to pay the 
profit say Vio of the amount is needed, hence 83,333. Thus the 

=====第212页=====
202 Capital and Profit 
total amount of money that has to circulate [XVII-
1056] = 83,333+£21,367=£104,700. With this £104,700 the 
capitalists and workers of class II buy their means of subsistence 
from class I, and class I buys the replacement of its constant 
capital in natura from class II. A REFLUX takes place. Class II buys 
e.g. means of subsistence from class I for £100; class I uses the 
same £100 to buy constant capital from class II. It is like a wagon 
which travels backwards and forwards, first taking A's load to B 
and then on the return journey taking B's freight to A. With this 
money, therefore, a commodity value not of £1,944,445 is 
realised, but one of 2x£l,944,445=£3,888,890. The same amount 
of money realises the constant capital of I, and the variable capital 
and profit of class II. There therefore remains of the 5 million of 
class II: 
III) £5 million-£l,944,445=£3,055,555. Let us assume that 
only Vio of this is replaced in natura, which as regards agriculture 
is much too little. This part does not enter into circulation at all, 
and does not need to be turned into gold. ABOUT 305,555 should 
be deducted from the amount to be realised. There remain: 
£2,750,000 worth of commodities. This 2nd circulation in class II 
is a mere reciprocal TRANSFER of capital, an exchange mediated 
through money. The iron producer buys coal from the coal 
producer, the latter in turn buys machines from the machine-
builder, he in turn buys iron from the iron producer, etc. The 
money here will for the most part circulate as means of payment 
and only balances will be paid in money. But even if it circulates 
. ., ,, . . , 2,750,000 
itself,  at most /20 is required. =137,500. 
What is required altogether, therefore, to realise the capital of 
6 million as well as a profit of  1,800,000  (wrong again, should be 
1,200,000, for this is V5 of 6 million or 20%, BUT NEVER MIND), to 
realise commodities of the value of 6 million plus profit of 1,200,000, or 
£7,200,000 worth, is the following: 
£12,143 circulating in class I; 
£104,700 between class I and class II; 
£137,500 in class II. Makes together: £254,343 in money. 
Sum total: 254,343. 
We have assumed in this connection that out of the capital of 
6 million, variable capital=388,888+1,111,112= 1,500,000, hence 
the variable capital =1/4 of the capital advanced. This is somewhat 
more than 1/6 of the capital advanced in wages. The adjustment of

balances and credit, etc., has not been brought into the calculation. 
Hence if the gold producer only provided enough gold to realise 
VÔ of the capital laid out in wages, or, what is the same thing, if 
enough of the commodity was exported to return gold from the 
mining countries, etc., this would be sufficient to provide the 
whole CURRENCY. And once this had been imported, it would be 
enough (deducting wear and tear on the money) as long as the 
mode of production remained the same. 
What is in general needed to enable the capitalist to withdraw 
more money from circulation than he throws into it is nothing 
more than this: enough money must circulate in order to convert 
into money the commodity values which are circulating. It is not 
yet necessary for this purpose that 1U of the capital should be 
available as money; this is the annual amount of money which has 
to be paid out in wages alone. The amount which is needed, 
however, is provided by the part of capital which is exchanged 
directly for gold, i.e. the commodities which are sold to the 
producers of gold and silver, and bring back BULLION in RETURN. But 
a part of the capital is accumulated as hoard, under its various 
aspects. Thus one part always lies idle. Assume that the capital 
which circulates annually in commodities=£110. And Vio is 
required to convert it into gold, hence £10. If then £10 worth of 
commodities are exported and exchanged for gold, this is divided 
up among the whole class which produces the £110 worth of 
commodities. 
[XVII-1057] Just as the producers of the means of consumption 
replace the variable capital and the part of the production of all 
classes expended as income, so these gold importing elements  (THE 
SAME AS GOLD PRODUCING PART) of the COMMUNITY replace the money 
needed for the circulation of the whole of the capital. 
After what we have developed so far, the following two points 
should first be made: 
Firstly: The turnovers of the same amount of money effected by 
the REFLUX are always accompanied by turnovers of the same 
monetary individuals, while the number of different turnovers 
performed by the same monetary individuals by no means 
includes the REFLUX. E.g. £100 from the SHOPKEEPER to the 
manufacturer, from the manufacturer to the worker, from the 
worker back to the SHOPKEEPER. Here the same money makes 
3 turnovers. At any rate 2, from the manufacturer to the workers, 
from the workers to the SHOPKEEPER. In addition to this, the REFLUX 
includes the repetition of this cycle, for the same amount of money, 
whether this consists of the same identical pieces of money or not. 

=====第214页=====
204 Capital and Profit 
A piece of money, on the other hand, may turn over 10 times in 
one day without expressing a REFLUX. I buy a commodity for 5s., 
the SHOPKEEPER gives the 5s. to another buyer in the change for £1, 
who in turn pays a worker with it, the worker makes a purchase 
with it, etc. The mere rapidity of turnover of the same piece of 
money—mostly in inverse proportion to its magnitude—is differ­
ent from the rapidity with which the cycle passes through its 
phases and is repeated. 
Secondly. Where money as coin appears in  C— M—C in the first 
conception, i.e. the conversion of the commodity into means of 
subsistence for its producer or owner, it only functions, first as 
paid out wages,  W— M—C;  second where profit, interest, rent, 
etc. (also the wages of the unproductive) are spent as income. For 
here the M that they expend represents the exchange value form 
of a sold commodity, to be subsequently resolved into means of 
subsistence.  C— M—C.  The fact that the money expended in this 
way simultaneously replaces a capital (capital+profit) does not 
alter the situation at all. On the other hand, all other functions in 
which money appears in circulation are always forms in which it 
constitutes a phase of capitalist reproduction, which either does 
not proceed as far as RETAIL at all (as the  EXCHANGE  OF CONSTANT  CAPITAL 
for CONSTANT CAPITAL), or is, at least, a  PREVIOUS  PROCESS.  As long as it 
circulates in this way it is money capital. For the RETAILER, the 
income taken from the other is admittedly also money capital. But 
this is not reciprocal. Here the money does not derive from the 
metamorphosis of capital as such, but from incomes which have 
arisen from it and become separated off. 
We have examined the cycle performed by the same amount of 
money between SHOPKEEPER, manufacturer and worker; which is IN 
FACT—if  we leave aside the mediating  SHOPKEEPER—the  circulation of 
the same amount of money between manufacturer and worker. 
The manufacturer buys with the same money labour43 which is 
always new, and the worker buys with the same money commodities 
that are always new. The manufacturer (if we leave aside the 
sHOpfkeeper]) originally throws this money into circulation. He must 
therefore have originally received it from circulation; but from the 
circulation with the gold producer. Or this process took place 
earlier and he possesses this money as a part of his capital 
accumulated in money form, just as he possesses another part in 
machinery. If the weekly value of his commodity=£600 (including 
£100 of profit, or 20% [of the capital advanced]) and the wage to 
be paid every week=£100, he must sell '/6 of his commodity to the 
gold producer. He then has once and for all the £100 he needs 

=====第215页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 205 
for the weekly payment of the wage. Suppose that the whole of his 
capital is  1,500,  of which 1,000 is fixed capital, 398 a week matière 
brute et instrumentale,' 100 a week wages. Suppose the fixed capital 
is used up over a cycle of 10 years. Then he needs £100 a year 
for depreciation. And £2 a week (we shall reckon 50 weeks of la­
bour a year). He therefore has a depreciation of £2 a week. 398 
matière brute and instrumentale and 100 wages=an advance of 
£500,  on which there is 20[%] profit=100. He perhaps has to 
replace the depreciation of £100 only once in the year (probably 
less often). The first week he takes in £600, of which 100 are not 
exchanged for commodities but for money. He has therefore 
converted the whole of his profit into money. Or he brought £100 
more, apart from the WORKING CAPITAL. (This is IN FACT advanced by 
the SHOPKEEPER ) Or he can consume none of his profit in the first 
week. For he possesses '/6 of the commodity in gold, his workers 
consume 1/6, and 4 /e replace his constant capital. In the next week 
he does not need to buy gold from the gold producer with any 
part of his commodity in order to be able to pay the wages. But in 
the 1ST  WEEK  he needs a part of his capital twice over. Firstly in the 
form of the commodity, the '/Ô that the workers will consume, 
secondly in the form of gold, so as to enable the workers 
[XVII-1058] to buy their VÔ from him. During this week, 
therefore, he must have currency in reserve for his own 
consumption, money which does not flow to him from the 
business but which he has inherited, etc., or he must live by 
borrowing, which is likely if he starts his production with £500. 
In the 2nd week he does not need to possess '/6 of his 
commodity in dual form as commodity and as money; for the 
£100 of wages flow back to him from the worker in payment for 
the commodity. 
Hence in order to maintain this circulation between himself and 
the worker in existence he only needs to buy gold from the gold 
producer with lU of the product of a week. 
There is always the question of who first throws into circulation 
the part of the money present therein. The answer is: it is always 
the capitalist, whether he be producer or MERCHANT; never the 
worker or the recipient of interest or rent. He who loans out at 
interest throws capital into circulation, i.e. TRANSFERS IT TO THE 
PRODUCTIVE CAPITALIST; but it is the latter who first throws it really into 
circulation. 
The recipient of rent receives his money in part from the FARMING

=====第216页=====
206 Capital and Profit 
CAPITALIST, in part from the  INDUSTRIAL  CAPITALIST  (who  WORKS  MINES,  etc., 
and for buildings) (and the rent of houses); further, he receives it 
from the worker. (Part of the rent of land, and the rent of his house.) 
In so far as rent is provided in currency by the  workers,  this part of 
its MONETARY  EXPRESSION  (just as with the SHOPKEEPER who sells means of 
subsistence to the workers) is drawn from the circulation between 
capitalist and workers, hence contained in the CURRENCY which 
circulates for wages. Admittedly this part does not flow back as 
quickly (if the manufacturer is not himself the LANDLORD or the 
FARMER, which is very often the CASE) as the part of the wages given 
out for the means of subsistence. Yet this latter CASE is a peculiar 
one. The same money which the MANUFACTURER or FARMER here gives 
out as a wage realises for him the rent he takes as LANDLORD, or the 
rental he takes as a letter of houses, leaving aside the fact that it 
replaces for him the depreciation of his commodities. The worker 
receives the value, namely the house, which he rents by the week. 
But a part of this value can be reduced to house- and 
ground-rent. And what the manufacturer pays as manufacturer 
simultaneously turns into money for him his revenue as LANDLORD 
and house-letting capitalist. He himself has advanced the CURRENCY 
for this in the purchase of labour.43 But the worker pays back to 
him ground- and house-rent. 
He makes 2 transactions with the worker. He buys his labour 
with money, and secondly he sells him housing and receives back 
for it a part of this money. But the value he sells here to the 
worker is not entirely paid by him; it contains unpaid labour. By 
paying this to him, the worker pays him ground- and house-rent. 
There is therefore no contradiction in the fact that in drawing 
back the money he himself has thrown into circulation he draws 
back more money than he threw into circulation, i.e. more money 
than the paid value he threw in. For all LANDLORDS and house-
letters, in so far as their ground- and house-rent is paid by the 
workers (just as with the taxes), the same money circulates the 
wage and realises a part of the rent and the interest on capital, 
hence monetises a part of the surplus value. All that is needed to

productive capitalists advance  for the  fixed capital simultaneously 
monetises  a part  of the  SURPLUS VALUE,  namely  the  rent  of land. 
Rent  on  private houses,  etc.,  forms part  of the  expenditure 
through which  the  capitalist  SPENDS HIS PROFITS;  the  actual rent paid 
by the  FARMER, MINING CAPITALIST,  etc.,  forms  a part  of the  surplus 
value  of their products. 
With  the  money  he  receives  for  rent  the  LANDLORD  buys 
commodities from  the  manufacturer  and  FARMER,  or he  buys them 
from  the  SHOPKEEPER,  who  pays  the  manufacturer  and  FARMER  with  it. 
Therefore once this part  of the  CURRENCY  exists,  it flows back 
continuously  to the  productive capitalists, just  as the  money  for 
wages does, although they must again withdraw  it from circulation 
by means  of commodities.  But it is  enough  to enable them  to pay 
the rent  in the  form  of money over  and  over again,  in order  to 
receive  the  money back  for  commodities.  But  more flows back  to 
them, namely  the  part  of the  rent which  the  workers  pay to the 
LANDLORD  as rent  of their houses  or the  part  the  MANUFACTURER  has 
paid as rent  for  buildings. Therefore  the  CURRENCY  which monetises 
the rent  is sufficient  not  only  to pay it  over  and  over again,  but to 
pay the  part  of the  wage which  is resolved into rent,  and the  part 
of the  costs  of fixed capital which  is resolved into rent.  But it is 
only the  part  of the  rent which does  not  always flow [from] wages 
or fixed capital that necessitates  its own  circulation  of money,  A 
SPECIFIC SUM  OF  CURRENCY OF ITS OWN. 
[XVII-1059] What  is true  of rent  (to the  LANDLORD)  and  interest 
(to the  money-lender)  is true  of profit itself (* whether interest  be 
paid to another person  or not,  whether  or not,  consequently,  it be 
included  in the  revenue  of the  producing capitalist),  as far as the 
productive capitalist spends  it, and  spend  it he  must,  in some part, 
since  he  lives upon  it.* The  money given  out in  THE SPENDING  OF 
PROFIT,  money thrown into circulation, * contributes  as well  as the 
money spent  in the  realisation  of rent  and  interest  to provide  the 
monetary means  for  paying  the  capitalist. 
The monetary expression  of rent, interest, profit,  as far as  they 
buy commodities  for  individual consumption,* must flow back  to 
the PRODUCTIVE CAPITALIST  as means  of purchase  or  payment just  as 
much  as  does  the  MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF WAGES.  The  profit,  RENT, 
INTEREST  HAVE  BEEN  SPENT DURING  LAST  YEAR;  the money given out for them 
is no  longer  in the  hands  of the  LANDLORD,  rentier,  PRODUCER,  but in 
those  of the  épicier,  who  pays  the  WHOLESALE DEALER  with  it, who in 
turn pays  the  PRODUCTIVE CAPITALIST.  In the  same measure  as  this 
money flows back  to the  SHOPKEEPER, HIS STORE HAS BECOME EMPTIED AND 
WANTS REFILLING.  The  money therefore performs  in reverse  the  same

course  as it  performed d'abord  in a  forward direction. Since  it 
thereby realises  the  commodity values  of the  PRODUCTIVE CAPITALIST, 
the latter  is able  to pay  RENT  and  interest with  the  same money  and 
TO EXPEND  FOR HIS OWN USE  another part  of the  surplus value. 
For the  productive capitalist  to withdraw from circulation more 
money than  he  threw into  it nothing more  is necessary than that 
enough money should circulate  in order  to pay the  commodity 
values.  If BARTER  were  to occur,  one  would find nothing mysterious 
in the  fact that  the  capitalist withdraws more commodity value 
from circulation  at the end of the  cycle than  he  threw  in in the 
form  of  money.  For at the end of the  cycle  he has a  greater 
commodity value  to exchange.  The  origin  of the  whole  PERPLEXED 
QUESTION  is therefore that  one  does  not see  where  the  CURRENCY  is to 
come from, the  REAL MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF THAT ENHANCED VALUE. WHAT 
PUZZLES  is that more  is withdrawn from circulation  by the  capitalist 
than  is thrown  in,  which  is the  more  PUZZLING  in that  he himself—as 
a class—IN  FACT  possesses  the  whole  of the  monetary wealth 
(possesses  it because  he  directly owns  the  whole  of the  surplus 
value, whatever  he may  have  to  give  up of  this).  But il faut 
distinguer."  As  capitalist  he  throws  his  capital alone into circulation 
(i.e. THE  MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF IT),  but as a  fellow  who has  realised 
profit  (or if he has not yet  realised  any he  must possess  OTHER 
MEANS),  he throws  PART  OF THE  MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF HIS SURPLUS VALUE  into 
circulation, just as  THE  MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF THE  OTHER PART  OF  THAT 
SURPLUS VALUE—OF RENT  AND INTEREST—is  CONTINUALLY THROWN INTO CIRCULA­
TION  by the  LANDLORD  and the rentier and lastly the  MONETARY EXPRESSION 
OF WAGES  is thrown  in  BY THE  WORKMEN.  If a  capitalist  has  thrown into 
circulation £1,000,  i.e.  employed  it reproductively,  and at the  same 
time consumed £200  (sub  specie  of profit),  and if his  profit=20%, 
he has  thrown into circulation exactly  as  much money  as is 
necessary  in  order  to  give monetary expression  to his 
commodity,=  1,200,  his  capital+his surplus value.  He has not 
made  a gift to circulation, either with  the  £1,000  or with  the  £200; 
he has  withdrawn commodity values  in return  for  this money,  for 
the 200 he has  withdrawn  as much  as he  threw  in, for the 1,000 
he has  withdrawn  20%  more. Nevertheless,  he has  provided  the 
MONETARY EXPRESSION  with which  the  commodity value  of £1,200  can 
be paid  to him, and, if we  view  the  capitalist  as one  person with 
the PARTNERS  IN THE  SURPLUS VALUE ABSORBED  BY HIM  11 The Times for

" WEALTH ABSORBERS " and their workers "WEALTH-WINNERS"*//,  he  has in 
fact himself provided the money with which  he is paid; but he has 
provided it  IN EXCHANGE FOR COMMODITIES  and  (AS FAR AS IT IS GOLD,  etc.)

The first class of productive capitalists consists  of those  who produce the 
means  of subsistence  in their final form,  in the  form  in which they 
enter into individual consumption.  The  value  of their annual 
product consists  of two  parts: [The first part is) constant capital, 
which contains the depreciation  of the fixed capital, this deprecia­
tion entering annually into  the  product.  The  other part, which 
remains unconsumed,  has  nothing  to do  with  the  value  of the 
product (although,  in the AVERAGE RATE  OF PROFIT, profit and interest 
on this part  of the capital advanced are reckoned just  as much  as 
on any  other part.  But  even  in this case  the  fixed capital only 
enters here  as an  ANNUITY, depreciation + profit  on  top, as with the 
second class  of capitalist.  We  leave  out the  profit here  as we are 
separating  the  surplus value).  It consists secondly  of raw material 
and matière instrumentale, which  in natura  in part, and in  value 
every time, entirely enter into  the  product, because they  are 
entirely consumed  in the  production process. Secondly: variable 
capital  In the hands  of the capitalist this exists as money; once  it is 
realised  it exists  as labour.  For the  worker  who  provides  the 
commodity  in which this part  of the capital  is realised,  it exists  as 
WAGES. Finally the 3rd part  of the product. Surplus value, which can 
be resolved into profit (interest)  and in  part into rent. 
The whole  of the  annual product  of this class,  in so far as it 
enters into annual consumption, enters into individual consump­
tion. Here  we are  leaving accumulation entirely  to one  side,  for 
the moment,  and  only examining simple reproduction.  A part of 
this product [XVII-1060]  is bought  by the  workers  of this class  I, 
hence paid back with  the  money which  is given them  in  WAGES  by 
the capitalists.  Or the  money  in which  the  variable capital  of this 
class is paid out buys back  an appropriate part  of the value  of the 
product. This money thereby flows back  to the  productive 
capitalist. This  is not a  replacement  of the  part  of the  capital

consumed by the workers; it is however the  REFLUX  to the 
productive capitalist of the CURRENCY in which he has paid the 
workers and with which he buys them afresh. The more or less 
small part of the surplus value which is consumed in natura in this 
class does not need any monetary expression, since it is 
appropriated by the producer in its natural form and does not 
enter into circulation. As  TO THE OTHER PART, the rent, interest, profit, 
which were paid the previous year (or, if the business is in 
progress, au fur et à mesure of the reproduction  (AS  TO THE PRODUCTIVE 
CAPITALIST)) (or, if the business is begun afresh, from the currency 
reserve of the productive capitalist), are used to buy back the 
appropriate part of the value of the total product of class I. In this 
way the CURRENCY in which the productive capitalist pays rent and 
interest flows back to him. Not as a replacement for what he has 
paid; but for the commodities he is selling afresh for the money 
he himself has provided. It is not a replacement for the interest, 
rent, etc., paid the previous year, but a REFLUX to productive capital 
of the CURRENCY in which he has paid the LANDLORD and the rentier 
and in which he will pay them afresh. He will give them back the 
same tokens as a claim on the aliquot part owing to them of the 
commodity SURPLUS, which represents their share in the surplus 
value of these commodities. Finally, if e.g. capitalist A, a member 
of this class, which can be divided into an immense number of 
particular spheres—as numerous as the means of subsistence 
themselves—buys means of subsistence from B, C, D, E, he 
thereby enables them to realise in money the aliquot PART, 
consumed by him, of the product A—the part consumed by the 
productive capitalist  himself.  They in turn enable him to realise 
his own product in money, until everyone has drawn from 
someone else's pocket the MONETARY EXPRESSION of the consumed part 
of his product. Thus the CURRENCY with which each of them has 
bought, and will buy again, the commodity of the other, flows 
back to each one. The part of the value of product I which 
consists of variable capital and surplus value (profit, interest,  RENT) 
is thus entirely realised in money. 
But as far the other part of capital I is concerned, constant 
capital, this must be replaced in natura, reconverted from the form 
of the FINAL commodity into its elements of production, raw 
material, machinery, matière instrumentale, etc. (We consider the 
part of these products which enters again into their own 
reproduction as a condition of production, such as corn, coal, etc., 
as belonging to 2 from this point of view. By the way, corn is not 
directly a means of subsistence, at most flour is. Fruit, eggs, etc.,

Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 211 
poultry, etc., are though.) Or this part of capital I must be bought 
by class II. We therefore come now to the circulation of money 
between these two classes. 
Second  class.  Its product consists similarly of constant capital (raw 
material, matière instrumentale and depreciation of the fixed 
capital), variable capital and surplus value, which is in turn divided 
in the form of profit (interest) and rent. But the product of this 
class does not enter into individual consumption (one might 
deduct dwellings, which enter into both individual and productive 
consumption. But this division is necessary for clarity) (or in so far 
as it does enter, it is class I, the section of class I whose product is 
simultaneously an element of variable and of constant capital). 
Neither the money which represents the variable capital of this 
class,  nor the surplus value which is realised in its product, can  BE 
SPENT IN THE PRODUCE OF THIS CLASS. 
In order now to determine the circulation between these 2 
classes, we start with the MOST EVIDENT POINT. 
Class II pays its variable capital out in money, as does class I, 
but this money does not flow back directly to the productive 
capitalist, as was the case under I). The worker buys his means of 
subsistence from class I. The  WHOLE  MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF THE  VARIABLE 
CAPITAL OF CLASS II therefore flows to the productive capitalists of 
class I. With it they buy from the productive capitalists of II a 
product value—i.e. constant capital, raw material, etc.—which is 
equal to the value of the variable capital of II. By this detour the 
CURRENCY originally given out by the capitalists of II and needed by 
them for the payment of wages flows back to them. At the same time 
they have by this detour sold the part of their product which 
equals the value of the variable capital to class I, and the latter 
class has TO THAT AMOUNT RECONVERTED ITS PRODUCE INTO THE ELEMENTARY 
CONSTITUENTS  OF THAT  PRODUCE.  //This mediation must occur with class I 
as well, in the case of those who produce means of subsistence 
which do not enter into the workers' consumption. Their workers 
buy from the other capitalists of I and thus provide them with the 
money with which they in part give monetary expression to 
interest, rent, profit and use this to buy (as SPENDING of income) 
from the capitalists of I who do not produce means of subsistence 
for the workers. They thereby replace for the latter the CURRENCY 
needed for their variable capital. At the same time this CURRENCY 
serves for them as the monetary expression of a part of the profit, 
etc.//  //Once banks have developed, the money [XVII-1061] for 
wages IN FACT returns every week to the productive capitalist, and it 
is a matter of indifference whether it would otherwise only have

returned to him by detour.// In any case we see here how the 
same sum of money circulates between a productive capitalist and 
his workers, is then paid out by these workers to another class of 
productive capitalists, and is laid out by these as capital in the 
purchase of the commodities of the first productive capitalist and 
thus returns to him. The purchase of constant capital on the part 
of class I occurs—since it is a conversion of capital into its 
elements, not a conversion of income into the means of 
subsistence—at longer intervals of time and in larger amounts, 
corresponding to the scale on which production takes place and to 
the conditions of reproduction of capital in each of the particular 
spheres of I. The money paid out in wages therefore does not 
flow back every week to class II, but at greater intervals and in 
greater quantities, so that one cannot tell at all by looking at this 
money where it comes from. In agriculture too, by the way, and in 
certain urban trades, even if wages are paid by the week, a great 
deal of labour is employed at certain times, hence a lot of wages is 
paid, while at other periods in the year little is employed and little 
paid. The reflux therefore does not take place as smoothly as 
CLOCKWORK. But all that is needed here is to grasp the essential 
movement. Its further course should first be developed under the 
credit system6 ; but to understand this, PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THIS 
ESSENTIAL MOVEMENT is necessary. The exchange of the part of the 
product of class II which represents its surplus value for the 
constant capital of class I, which exists in means of subsistence, is 
tangibly demonstrated on the world market, e.g. in the exchange 
of English CALICOES for cotton, or the exchange of English 
machinery and yarn for foreign wheat, etc. 
Finally, as far as concerns the income which can be utilised in 
this sphere in the form of profit (interest, rent), its monetised 
existence of the previous year, etc., is consumed in the last 
remaining part of the product of class I. There thus flows to 
class I the money with which it buys back from class II the part of 
its constant capital which is still missing. The money for its surplus 
value thus flows back to this class. 
In this way the productive capitalists of I and II, apart from the 
fact that their fund for income is established in the form of 
money, are [able] to pay interest and rent in money to the lenders 
of capital and the LANDLORDS, whereupon the whole process begins 
again. It must be noted here, once more, that a reproduction of 
capital for class I is a realisation of surplus value in money for 
class II; and, further, that the way in which the money flows from II 
to I, precisely because this is in the form of daily expenditure or 

=====第223页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 213 
occasionally (irregularly) more important expenditures—since it is 
the expenditure of income and therefore corresponds to the needs 
and whims of individual consumption—must differ from the way 
and form in which the same sum of money flows back from I to 
II, since this is a reconversion of capital existing as money into 
productive capital; and the quantities in which purchases are made 
here,  ditto the intervals [of payment], must correspond to the 
conditions of production of both capitals. 
It is clear that if the capitalist SPENDS £200 IN REVENUE and throws 
£1,000 into circulation as capital, but withdraws £1,200, he has 
withdrawn from circulation more money than he threw into it, for 
as capitalist he has only thrown £1,000 into circulation. He has 
spent the £200 on means of subsistence of equal value, which have 
passed into his consumption fund. In short, as mere money-
owner, and spender, not as capitalist. 
Class I has now replaced the whole of its constant capital in 
natura, its variable capital in money, and similarly its income fund 
in money (profit (interest, rent)) and it has nothing further to buy 
from class II, nothing further to pay to it (since we are for the 
moment not speaking of accumulation here). That part of 
agriculture, as for example the cultivation of corn, etc., the 
breeding of cattle, etc., belongs at the same time to class II, i.e. is 
at the same time a producer of constant capital, does not alter this 
situation. To the extent that agriculture does belong to class II, 
what we shall now develop further in relation to class II applies to 
it as well. 
We showed previously—presupposing reproduction on the 
same scale—that the new labour added during the year, or the 
value produced during the year,=the variable capital 
reproduced + the surplus value, cannot buy any more or pay for 
any more than what has just been discussed, i.e. the annual 
product of the articles which enter into individual consumption 
(class I) and the part of the product of the producers df constant 
capital which represents the variable capital and the incomes of 
class II. 
Adam Smith would have been entirely correct if he had said 
that this part of the annual product resolves itself into mere 
income, which is paid by wages, profit (interest), rent. He would 
nevertheless have had to add here too that this total income 
replaces the total constant capital of class I. But Smith is wrong in 
asserting this of the totality of the annual product, and in having 
the constant capital of class II replaced by its income and that of 
class I. It is therefore also incorrect when Smith says the following. 
15-613

214 Capital  and  Profit 
Beforehand [XVII-1062]  one  further remark: under  "DEALER" 
Smith includes  all  capitalists  who  participate  in the  production 
process  and the  circulation process,140 under  "CONSUMERS"  he 
includes  the  workers  and the  capitalists,  LANDLORDS,  etc., and  their 
RETAINERS, AS FAR AS THEY SPEND REVENUE. 
He says: 
* "The circulation  of  every country  may be  considered  as  divided into  two 
different branches—the circulation  of the  dealers with  one  another,  and the  circulation 
between  the dealers  and  consumers. Though  the  same pieces  of money, whether paper 
or metal,  may be  employed sometimes  in the one  circulation  and  sometimes  in the 
other,  yet as  both are  constantly going  on at  the same time, each requires  a certain kind 
of money  of one  kind  or another  to carry  it on. The  value  of the  goods circulated 
between  the different dealers with  one  another never  can  exceed  the value  of those circulated 
between  the  dealers  and the  consumers, whatever  is bought  by the  dealers being ultimately 
destined  to be sold  to the  consumers" (Wealth  of Nations, McCulloch's edition* [Vol.  II, 
pp. 79-80]). 
This corresponds  to Smith's incorrect analysis  of the  value  of the 
commodity into  WAGES, PROFIT  and  RENT.  On this see our earlier 
remarks.3  And  this incorrect view itself rests  in turn  on the  fact 
that the  accumulated capital—including  the  constant capital—in 
the capitalist mode  of  production originally flows from surplus 
labour,  i.e.  profit  is  converted into capital, from which  it 
nevertheless  by no  means follows that  the  profit once converted 
into capital consists  of "profit". 
The  VALUE  of the  GOODS CIRCULATED BETWEEN  THE  DIFFERENT DEALERS  is 
always greater than the  VALUE  of the  GOODS CIRCULATED BETWEEN  THE 
DEALERS  AND  CONSUMERS,  because the first circulation includes an 
EXCHANGE  of the  natural components  of  constant capital, which 
replaces  a part  of the  value  of the  capital which  the  CONSUMER  never 
pays.  The  simultaneous parallel course  of the  movements—and 
every successive moment  of  metamorphosis  and  reproduction 
appears  at the  same time  as  occurring simultaneously  and in 
parallel—prevented Smith from seeing  the  movement  itself.  He 
would otherwise have found  in the  monetary circulation  of capital 
a refutation rather than  a confirmation  of his  proposition, which  is 
derived from  an  incorrect analysis  of the  natural price.141  The 
phrase  "DEALER"  and  "CONSUMER"  is also disturbing, since the 
DEALERS—the  productive capitalists—appear  in that  EXCHANGE  simul­
taneously as the final  "CONSUMERS",  even if industrial  CONSUMERS,  not 
individual. 
Tooke remarks  as  follows  on the  above passage from Adam 
Smith, which  he  makes into  one of the  basic foundations  of his 
theory  of money:

Episode. Reflux Movements  of Money 215 
* "All  the  transactions between dealers  and  dealers,  by  which  are to be 
understood  all  sales from  the  producer  or importer, through  all the  stages  of 
intermediate processes  of manufacture  or otherwise  to the  retail dealer  or the 
exporting merchant,  are  resolvable into movements  or transfers  of capital.  Now 
transfers  of capital  do not  necessarily suppose,  nor do  actually  as a  matter  of fact 
entail,  in the  great majority  of transactions,  a passing  of money, that  is, bank notes 
or coin—I mean bodily,  and not by  fiction—at  the  time  of the  transfer.  All the 
movements  of capital  may be, and the  great majority  are,  effected  by the 
operations  of banking  and  credit without  the  intervention  of actual payment  in coin 
or bank notes, that  is, actual, visible,  and  tangible bank notes,  not  suppositions bank 
notes,  issued with  one  hand  and  received back  by the  other,  or,  more properly 
speaking, entered  on one  side  of the  ledger with  a counter-entry  on the  other.  And 
there  is the further important consideration, that the total amount  of the transactions between 
dealers  and  dealers must,  in the last  resort,  be determined  and  limited by the amount  of those 
between dealers  and  consumers"  (Th.  Tooke,  An  Inquiry into  the  Currency Principle* 
London,  1844,  [pp.]  35-36). 
In the  concluding sentence, Tooke repeats Adam Smith's 
proposition,  with  the  crudeness peculiar  to him as a  practitioner, 
in the  process depriving  it of its  theoretical teeth. That  the  "TOTAL 
AMOUNT"  of the  "TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN DEALERS  AND  DEALERS"  must be 
determined "IN  THE  LAST RESORT"  by the  AMOUNT  of the  TRANSACTIONS 
BETWEEN DEALERS  and  CONSUMERS  is not subject to any doubt and is a 
triviality.  The  capital  of the  whole class that  is employed  in 
production at all depends in the  "LAST RESORT"  upon, and is 
therefore  determined  by, the  amount  of the  product which  the 
producer  can  sell,  for it is  only from  the  product  he sells that  he 
derives  his  profit.  But  Adam Smith, whose proposition Tooke 
thinks  he is  repeating,  was not  talking about this. Smith says: 
* "the value  of the  goods circulated between dealers  and 
dealers"  = "the value  of  those circulated between dealers  and 
consumers".*  Tooke  is exclusively concerned  in the  above-
mentioned pamphlet with  the  struggle against  the  CURRENCY 
PRINCIPLE.142  The [XVII-1063] phrase that the  CIRCULATION BETWEEN 
DEALERS  and  DEALERS  can be resolved into  "MOVEMENTS  OR  TRANSFERS  OF 
CAPITAL"  //he is  only interested here, vis-à-vis his-opponents,  in the 
question  of how the  reciprocal obligations arising  out of the 
circulation  of capitals  in the  reproduction process  are  settled,  a 
question  which  is theoretically entirely subordinate// shows  the 
crudeness of the whole conception.  "MOVEMENTS  OF CAPITAL."  What 
was required  was to  determine  and  analyse precisely these 
MOVEMENTS.  What underlies this  is that  he  means  the  MOVEMENTS  of 
capital  in the  sphere  of circulation,  for  which reason  he  always 
understands  under capital here money  or  commodity capital. 
"TRANSFERS  OF CAPITAL"  are very different from  MOVEMENTS  OF CAPITAL, 
although  they  are  MOVEMENTS.  They only apply  in fact  to mercantil-

216 Capital and Profit 
ist capital, and they mean in fact nothing more than that the 
different phases, in which capital passes from the hands of one 
buyer to the next, are IN POINT OF FACT only the movement of its own 
circulation. The  "MOVEMENTS"  of capital, however, are qualitatively 
distinct phases of the reproduction process. "TRANSFER" OF CAPITAL 
also takes place when variable capital passes into the hands of the 
workers as wages, thus being converted into "CURRENCY". The long 
and short of the story is simply that in the movements of capital as 
such—before its definitive exchange as commodity with the 
consumers—the money only circulates as means of payment, 
hence functions in part exclusively as money of account, in part 
exclusively as balance, IF THERE BE ANY. Tooke concludes from this 
that the distinction between these two functions of money is a 
distinction between "CAPITAL" and "CURRENCY". In general he firstly 
confuses money and commodity with money and commodity as 
modes of existence of capital, with money and commodity capital, 
and secondly regards the particular money form in which the 
capital is circulated as a distinction between "capital" and "coin". 
The following point by Tooke is a good one: 
* "The business of bankers, setting aside the issue of promissory notes on 
demand, may be divided into two branches, corresponding with the distinction 
pointed out by Dr. Smith of the transactions between dealers and dealers, and 
between dealers and consumers. One branch of the banker's business is to collect 
capital from those who have not immediate employment for it, and to distribute or 
transfer it to those who have. The other branch is to receive deposits of the 
incomes of their customers, and to pay out the amount, as it is wanted for 
expenditure, by the latter in the objects of their consumption. The former may be 
considered as the business behind the counter, and the latter before or over the 
counter: the former being a circulation of capital, the latter of currency" * [I.e., 
p. 36]. 
(I.e. the first circulation OF money capital. This is not actual 
circulation, but TRANSFER. Real circulation always includes an 
objective moment of the reproduction process of capital. TRANSFER, 
as with MERCANTILE CAPITAL, puts one person in place of another; but 
the capital continues to be in the same phase as before. There is 
each time a transfer of money—or titles to property—from one to 
the other (or also a transfer of commodity), without the money's 
having undergone any metamorphosis. This is even truer of the 
TRANSFER of MONETARY CAPITAL BY LOANS, etC, BY THE MEDIUM OF THE BANKER. 
The same is true of the  TRANSFER  by which the capitalist distributes 
the monetary expression of his surplus value in part to the rentier, 
in part to the LANDLORD. In the latter case it is distribution of 
income; in the former, distribution of capital. Only the TRANSFER of

MERCANTILE CAPITAL from ONE SORT OF MERCHANT TO THE OTHER brings 
commodity capital itself closer to its conversion into money.) 
* "The distinction or separation in reasoning of that branch of banking which 
relates to the concentration of capital on the one hand and the distribution of it on the 
other, from that branch which is employed in administering the circulation* for 
* local purposes of the district, is so important, etc."* (I.e., [pp.] 36-37). 
In class II as in class I the total product can be divided into 
3 parts. 
//Here it may be remarked incidentally: capital, as opposed to 
profit, is the name of the amount of value advanced. But it is not an 
amount of value. It is capital and therefore implies in this form a 
relation to profit. As long as the surplus value is not realised, 
hence the movement of capital as capital has not yet come to an 
end, the total product (surplus value included) is called capital; it 
is pregnant with surplus value, but the latter has not yet 
[XVII-1064] attained an independent position in relation to 
capital. It is still self-realising capital,  HENCE  capital absolutely.// 
1) 2) 3) 
Constant capital—Variable capital. Surplus value. (Profit, rent, 
interest.) 
We have seen how 2) and 3) have been realised and have 
circulated in the exchange with 1). We have now to consider the 
first part, constant capital. 
It consists a) of the unconsumed part of the fixed capital, which 
does not enter into the value of the product, and therefore does 
not come into consideration. 
b) Secondly, however, it is necessary to replace the part of the 
value which represents the depreciation of the fixed capital and 
matière instrumentale and matière brute, s'il y en a." 
Just as in class I the part of the product which consists of 
profit—or which is expended as income—is realised through the 
consumption of the product in natura on the part of production 
or by exchange within the different spheres of production of this 
same class, so in class II the same takes place for the constant 
capital, whether through replacement in natura in its own sphere 
of production, or through exchange with products between the 
different spheres of this same class. The products here re-enter as 
condition of production into their own production (as corn enters 
as seed, breeding cattle, etc.) or the product of sphere A e.g. 
enters into the product of sphere B as condition of production, 
Instrumental material and raw material, if any.— Ed. 

=====第228页=====
218 Capital and Profit 
and the product of sphere B enters into the product of sphere A, 
as iron into machine production or machines into iron production. 
The product of sphere A may enter into sphere B, that of B 
into C, and that of C into A. This intertwining—the GENERAL 
BALANCE of these spheres, without any need for an exact balance 
between any two spheres—makes no difference to the situation. It 
lies in the nature of the situation that here money will develop as 
means of payment and therefore the movement without money 
will be compensated for by SETOFFS. Yet since the period in which 
product A enters B may differ from the period in which B 
enters A, etc., here too circulation of money can take place, and 
will do so plus ou moins,' 1 particularly before capitalist production is 
completely developed. It is in any case important to consider it so 
here. 
Since there in fact takes place here EXCHANGE of constant capital 
for constant capital, and the products merely change their place in 
the production process reciprocally, the money constantly flows 
back to the person who expends it. E.g. when the machine 
manufacturer buys iron in order to replace his machine-building 
machine, there enters into this: 1) the depreciation of the 
machine-building machine  itself;  he advances this  himself;  2) iron, 
etc. He buys this from the iron manufacturer; the iron manufac­
turer buys machines from him in order to replace the depreciation 
of his own machinery and thus the money flows back to the 
machine-builder. 
Even where the product enters directly into its own reproduc­
tion, there may take place, in consequence of the division of 
labour, a circulation of money; the reproduction of capital may be 
accompanied by a circulation of money. A FARMER may sell all his 
corn and buy the seed from another farmer. But then the latter 
must grow seed both for himself and for the other. To the one 
farmer a part of the value of the corn represents the purchase 
price for the replacement of the seed, to the other it represents his 
variable capital-l-surplus value. In this case the money does not 
flow back between the two of them directly. Yet the seed man 
must expend the money in order to buy means of subsistence, 
corn among other things. He pays his workers with the money and 
expends it as his own income. The money of the farmer's workers 
flows back to him in part. They belong to the public who enable 
him to sell his corn as a whole. And so it is with cattle-breeding. 
One farmer may only fatten up the cattle to sell them as means of 
a More or less.— Ed. 

=====第229页=====

subsistence; but the other may produce breeding cattle, to replace 
the constant capital of the farmer who fattens for slaughter. 
This part—resolving into constant capital—of the product of 
the productive capitalists who produce constant capital for class I, 
is just as much the product of the year's labour as every other part 
of the product, i.e. it is only reproduced by passing through the 
labour process. But its value is the result of past labour, labour of 
the previous year, etc. And as such value it buys back the part of 
the product which is required for its reproduction. The more 
developed capitalist production is, the more, consequently, the 
result of past labour enters as agens into production, the greater is 
this part of the product, which falls to the share of production and 
never leaves that sphere. And the greater the value component of 
the product which goes to replace the constant part of the 
constant capital. But the labour is more productive to that degree. 
This value itself is dependent not on the labour it cost but the 
labour its reproduction costs. It is therefore on the one hand 
constantly piled up with the progress of capitalist production, and 
on the other hand constantly depreciated over shorter or longer 
periods. Its value only remains constant as long as the mode of 
production does not alter. 
[XVII-1065] We have still to consider the following: 
1) Accumulation, specially in respect of money. 
2) The simultaneity of the movements. 
3) The gold and silver producer. 
4) The whole movement of mercantile capital. 
First of all, as far as concerns 4), MERCANTILE CAPITAL, we have 
already elucidated its movement with the example of the SHOPKEEPER 
who sells means of subsistence to the workers. Put in the place of 
this MERCHANT A143 the whole class of these SHOPKEEPERS. Their 
business is, as before, to sell the producer's commodity to the 
workers, and to take back from them  MONEY  WAGES  in return. Their 
capital is replaced IN  MONEY  and their profit is realised by the same 
money as originally existed as variable capital and is then paid to 
the workers as  MONEY  REVENUE and in turn paid back by the workers 
as COIN to the SHOPKEEPER, in order to realise the share of the total 
product which belongs to the workers in aliquot parts of that 
product.  The  MONEY  CAPITAL  of the  SHOPKEEPER  himself,  in so far as it is 
not INVESTED IN COSTS OF CIRCULATION, consists of his circulating money 
capital. If he buys for £200 AT EVERY PERIOD in which he makes a 
purchase, 100 for credit, 100 from his own pocket, he has 
advanced £100 of the money capital constantly present in 
circulation. If this £200 turns over 40 times he successively buys 

=====第230页=====
220 Capital and Profit 
commodities of a value of £8,000 with it. It changes nothing in the 
situation that a SHOPKEEPER from this sphere A buys from 50 differ­
ent producers, and 50 SHOPKEEPERS from this sphere in their turn 
buy from 1 producer. Just as little is anything changed by the fact 
that this SHOPKEEPER consumes his profit in part in his own 
commodities, and in part buys commodities with it from other 
SHOPKEEPERS, who in turn buy from him again in accordance with the 
division of labour, so that the money which realises the profit of 
this class passes in turn through an intermediate circulation 
(SPENDING  OF REVENUE) among the different agents of this class. What 
he consumes through purchasing from others realises their profit, 
and what others consume from him realises his profit. But each of 
them must thereby buy back from the producer with this money 
(in which their profit is realised) a part of the commodities, in 
order to renew this consumption. E.g. if SHOPKEEPER A of this class 
buys for £100 from producers and receives commodities for £110, 
in return for which he receives £110 from the workers, he has a 
profit of 10%. But if he buys for £110 and consumes for £10, he 
continues to sell to the workers for 100 and receives 110. But the 
10 return to the PRODUCER in payment for the commodities 
consumed by the shopkeeper. He therefore receives the full value 
of the commodities for 10. If the profit is 10% he receives 
commodities for £10Vio, but he consumes these. If in contrast he 
buys with £10 from another sHOp[keeper], B, the latter realises his 
profit in this transaction, but must return £9 10/n to his producer, 
in order to replace the commodity. And if B buys from A for £10, 
the same thing is true of him. 
Assume that the whole of the product which producer class I 
(the section which produces means of subsistence, and indeed that 
part of them which is sold to the workers) sells to this SHOPKEEPER 
class A=£500,000. 
Assume that there are 5 WHOLESALE  DEALERS  who buy this 500,000; 
but that their capital turns over 5 times. Every fifth of a year they 
buy 100,000 between them. Each of the 5 buys 20,000 worth. 
Therewith each buys 100,000 worth over the whole year, thus 
500,000 taken together. Assume their profit is 10%. Then the 
profit on the 20,000 each year=£2,000, and in each Vs of a 
year=£400. 
The capitalist therefore sells in appearance to each of the 5 
£20,400 worth of commodities every fifth of the year for £20,000. 
These 5 WHOLESALE DEALERS sell to the SHOPKEEPERS, RETAILERS of class A, 
in the course of every fifth of a year. Let there be 100 of these 
retailers. They sell by the day and by the hour, but buy at smaller

Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 221 
intervals from the WHOLESALE DEALERS, perhaps only every fifth of a 
year or every month. Let the price supplement of these SHOPKEEPERS 
be 20%, namely 10% profit and 10% to replace their circulation 
costs (which also have to be deducted for the 5 WHOLESALE dealers; 
to simplify matters we have not done this). The commodity value 1 
WHOLESALE DEALER has in hand=£20,400. And the commodity value 5 
have in hand is £102,000 (since this is for Vs of a year, over the 
whole year this=£510,000 worth of commodities). Of this 
£102,000 each SHOPKEEPER has to buy £1,020. 20 of these 
shopkeepers correspond to 1 WHOLESALE DEALER, but V20 of 
£20,400=£1,020. 10% on this £1,020 makes 102. But let us 
assume this SHOPKEEPER makes his purchases 10 times a year. He 
then needs only £510 to buy £1,020 over a fifth of a year.144 
[XVI I-1065a] Assume that the complete wage bill for classes I 
and II is £550,000. This is therefore the commodity value which 
the SHOPKEEPER  class A sells to the workers. For the SHOPKEEPER to gain 
10[%] he must have paid V11 less for £550,000 than is contained 
therein. This=£50,000. So that he would only have paid £500,000 
for the commodity value of £550,000. Only assuming that the 
SHOPKEEPER turns over his capital 10 times in the year, or renews his 
purchases 10 times, twice every fifth of a year. Thus he only has 
to advance a capital of £55,000. And on this there is an annual 
profit of 10%=£5,500. And this makes £1,100 every Vs of a year. 
Assume there are 100 SHOPKEEPERS; then each of them advances a 
capital of only £550. And every 5th of a year each of them 
receives a profit of ll%.a But each of them sells to the workers 
every 5th of a year for £1,100. Over the year this amounts to 
5,500  for 1 SHOPKEEPER and 550,000 for the 100 SHOPKEEPERS. On this 
£1,100 he adds a profit of £11. The commodity therefore costs 
him only £1,089. And  5,445  annually. And 544,500 for the 100. 
So that the producer would have sold him commodities of the 
value of 550,000 for 544,500. But there is further to be deducted 
the profit the SHOPKEEPER makes on the capital invested in the costs 
of circulation, the shop, etc., the depreciation of this capital; 
finally the part of the price supplement which falls to the capital 
invested in the productive labour of RETAILING: costs and profit. 
Assume that all of this comes to as much as the profit on the 
capital constantly circulating in purchases. Hence another £11 
every fifth of a year. Thus 11 must be deducted from the £1,089, 
which brings it to  1,078.  But in order to simplify matters let us 
assume that this second £11 is a price supplement which includes 
a Thus in the original. It should be  "£11".—  Ed. 

=====第232页=====
222 Capital  and Profit 
the costs (of circulation and production) and profit on the 
productive part of the capital. £11 per year comes to £55 for each 
sHopfkeeper], and  5,500  for the 100. We therefore deduct this 5,500, 
as not contained in the value of the purchased commodity, but added 
to it by the SHOP[keeper]. There remain 544,500. This is the real 
commodity value which the sHOp[keepers] buy annually from the 
producers. There must further be deducted  5,500  for profit. There 
remain 539,000. The SHOP[keeper] therefore pays 539,000 a year to 
the producer, and for this he receives a commodity value of 544,500 
from him, adding 5,500, partly in circulation costs, partly in 
production costs (which however include the profit he himself makes 
as a capitalist producer). So we now have: 
The workers buying commodities for 550,000 every year. 
100 SHOPKEEPERS  selling to them every year for 550,000; costs 
them 539,000 (whereby a value of  5,500  is added by them 
themselves). And they obtain from the producers a commodity 
value of 544,500 for the 539,000. 
Each of the 100 SHOPKEEPERS sells every year for £5,500, every 
10th of a year for £550, and every 5th of a year for £1,100. A 
value of £11 is deducted from this £1,100, added by the 
sHop[keeper]. £1,089 remains (every 5th of a year). This £1,089 
costs the shopkeeper 1,078 (every 5th of a year) and over the 
whole year 5,390, and it costs the 100 SHOPKEEPERS 107,800 every 5th 
of a year, over the whole year 539,000. 20 of these fellows 
therefore buy for 21,560 every 5th of a year, receiving in return a 
commodity value of l,089x20=£22,780. 
[XVIII-1066] 145 One more point on the question of interest on 
interest60: 
The notion of capital as a self-reproducing  entity—BY  VIRTUE  OF ITS 
INNATE  QUALITY AS A PERENNIAL ANNUALLY GROWING VALUE led tO the WOI1-
drous ideas of Dr. Price, which left the fantasies of the alchemists far 
behind them. Pitt seriously believed in these ideas and made them 
pillars of his financial wisdom in his laws on the SINKING  FUND  146: 
* "Money bearing compound interest increases at first slowly. But, the rate of 
increase  being continually accelerated, it becomes in some time so rapid, as to mock 
all the powers of imagination. One Penny, put out at our Saviour's birth to 5% 
compound  interest would before this time have increased to a greater sum, than 
would  be contained in a 150 millions of Earths, all solid gold. But if put out to 
simple  interest, it would in the same  time,  have amounted to no more than 7 sh. 
4Väd.  Our government has hitherto chosen to improve money in the last rather than 
the first of those  ways"  (Richard Price, An Appeal to the Public, on the Subject of the 
National  Debt, London, 1772, 2nd ed.* [pp. 18-19]). 
(His trick: the government should borrow at simple interest and 
put out the borrowed money at compound interest.) In his: 

=====第233页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements  of Money 223 
Observations  on  Reversionary Payments  etc.,  London, 1772,  he flies 
still higher: 
* "A shilling  put out to 6%  compound interest  at our  Saviour's birth would  ... 
have increased  to a  greater  sum  than  the  whole solar system could hold, supposing 
it a sphere equal  in diameter  to the  diameter  of Saturn's orbit"  * (I.e., XIII, 
note).  *"A  state need never, therefore,  be under  any  difficulties;  for,  with  the 
smallest savings,  it may, in as  little time  as its  interest  can  require,  pay off the  largest 
debt"* (I.e., [XIII/]XIV,  p. 136). 
What  fine principles emerged from this  for the  credulous Pitt! 
Price  WAS  SIMPLY DAZZLED  BY THE  ENORMOUS QUANTITIES RESULTING FROM  THE 
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION  OF  NUMBERS.  Since he regarded capital as A 
SELFACTING THING, WITHOUT  ANY  REGARD  TO THE  CONDITIONS  OF  REPRODUCTION  OF 
LABOUR,  merely  as a  self-increasing number (just  as Malthus regarded 
MAN in his  GEOMETRICAL  progressiona),  he  could believe  he had  found 
the laws  of its  growth  in that formula.  The  formula: S=c(l  + i)". 
(In this formula, S=the  sum of  capital  and  interest  to be 
calculated;  c=the capital advanced; i=the rate  of interest  (ALIQUOT 
PART  OF 100) and  n=the number  of years during which  the  process 
takes  place.)  In a  speech  of 1792, proposing  to increase  the sum of 
money devoted  to the  SINKING FUND,147  Pitt takes  Dr.  Price's 
mystification  entirely seriously. 
"The House  of Commons resolved  in 1786" (see  Lauderdale  )  "that  the 
consentement unanime  was that  1 million pounds sterling  be raised  for the  public 
benefit" (Lauderdale,  I.e., p. 175). 
According  to Price, who was believed  by Pitt, nothing was better, 
of course, than  to tax the  people  in order  to "accumulate"  the 
sum of  money raised  by the tax and  thereby  to spirit away  the 
STATE DEBT  through the mystery of  COMPOUND INTEREST.  Taxes for 
"SINKING FUND"  or amortisation fund. 
"That resolution  was  soon followed  by a  law—of which Pitt  was the 
author—which ordained  the  accumulation  of V4  million pounds sterling, until  the 
time when  the  annuities fell  due and the  fund increased  to £4  million  per  year" 
[p. 176]  (CH.  XXXI  of the  ACT  of the  26th Year  of the  Reign  of George III).b 
In his  speech  of 1792,  in which  he proposed increasing  the sum 
devoted  to the  SINKING FUND,  Pitt included machinery, credit,  etc., 
among  the  reasons  for  England's commercial pre-eminence.  But 
"the most extensive  and  long-lasting reason  is accumulation. This principle  is 
developed fully  and  explained adequately  in Smith's work alone, that genius,  etc. ... 
This accumulation  of capitals operates  by reserving  at least  a part  of the  annual 
profit  in order  to increase  the  principal  sum,  which must then  be employed  in the 
a [Th. R.  Malthus,]  An  Essay  on the  Principle  of Population..., London,  1798, 
pp. 25-26.—  Ed. 
b Marx quotes partly  in German  and  partly  in French.— Ed.

224 Capital  and  Profit 
same manner  in the  next year, thereby providing  a continuous profit"  [pp. 178-
79].» 
Pitt considered Price's interest  on  interest—COMPOUND  INTEREST— 
calculation,  to be  identical with Adam Smith's theory  of accumulation. 
This  is important. 
[XVIII-1067] Child,  the  ancestor  of the  London banking system, 
was incidentally  an  enemy  of the  "monopoly"  of the  usurers,  in 
exactly  the  same sense  as Moses  and Son in its  bulletins declares  its 
opposition  to the  "monopoly prices"  of the  small tailors. 
We already find with Josiah Child (father  of the  London 
banking system) (Traités  sur le  commerce  et sur les  avantages  qui 
résultent  de la  réduction  de  l'intérêt  de l'argent,  by Jos. Child (written  in 
1669),  etc.,  translated from  the  English, Amsterdam  and  Berlin, 
1754) that 
"£100  at 10%  would produce 102,400 pounds sterling  in 70  years,  if interest  is 
added  on the  interest"3  ([p.] 115). 
The first notion of  ACCUMULATION  is that  OF  HOARDING,  just as the 
first notion  of  CAPITAL  is as  MERCANTILE  capital.  The  second notion  is 
that of COMPOUND INTEREST,  just  as interest-bearing capital,  or money 
lent out at  interest,  is the  second historical form  of capital. Political 
economy  SOMETIMES  becomes perplexed when  the  antediluvian 
expressions  of the  relations peculiar  to capitalist production again 
assert themselves  as expressions  of the  latter,  as with interest  on 
interest for the accumulation  OF  CAPITAL. 
How Price's notion  is unthinkingly allowed  to slip into  the  works 
of modern,  and  relatively critical, economists  is shown  e.g. by the 
following passage from  The  Economist 
*"If there  be any  cases  in England  in which land, with  all its  rights  and 
privileges,  has not  been bought  and  sold over  and  over again"*  (and  hence,  as he 
very wisely concludes,  "has  become merely  the  representative  of the  money paid 
for it")  *"—which  we  doubt—we  do ... not  doubt  ... that every sixpence  of rent  is 
the representative  of capital, saved  by the  landlord  and  reinvested  by the  land,  in 
those cases where land  has not  been sold... Capital, with compound interest  on every 
portion  of capital  saved,  is so all  engrossing, that  all the  wealth  in the  world from which 
income  is derived  has  long  ago  become  the interest  on capital Although land  be more 
valuable  in some places than  in others,  all rent  is now the  payment  of interest  on 
capital previously invested  in the  land" (Economist, July  19,  1851).*b 
The Economist could  say,  based  on the  same incredible notion, 
*that  all the  labour that  may in  myriads  of ages  be realised, will 
only represent interest  due to  capital till  now  accumulated.  * I cite 
a Marx quotes partly  in German  and  partly  in French.— Ed. 
b The  Economist,  No. 412,  July  19, 1851, p.  796.—  Ed. 

=====第235页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 225 
the passage merely on account of the incredible notion that 
accumulation=interest on interest. Otherwise, by the by, and en 
passant, The Economist remarks, I.e., *that the community as such 
"as a corporate body ... claims the land (as common property), and never gives 
up that claim".* 
He who expends capital in the purchase of land 
* "does in fact forfeit and give up to the community some of the advantages 
which belong to property strictly and exclusively personal" (I.e.). 
Finally there is the following rubbish from the "romantic" 
Müller: 
"Dr. Price's colossal increase in compound interest, or the self-accelerating 
forces of the human being, presupposes an undivided, unbroken, and uniform 
order over many centuries, if it is to bring about these incalculable effects. As soon 
as the capital is divided, cut up, into a number of separate branches, growing on 
their own account, the whole process of the accumulation of forces begins again. 
Nature has divided the progression of force into a series of courses of roughly 20 
to 25 years, which are allotted to each individual worker on an average. After this 
period of time has expired, the worker leaves his course and must now transfer the 
capital gained through the compound interest of labour to a new worker; for the 
most part he must divide it among several workers or children. They have first to 
animate and learn to employ the capital which falls to them, before they can draw 
from it actual compound interest. An immense amount of capital gained by civil 
society is, even in the most dynamic communities, piled up gradually, over long 
years,  and is not employed in the direct extension of labour, being rather 
transferred to another individual, a worker, a bank, the state, under the name of a 
loan,  as soon as a considerable sum has been brought together. The recipient then 
sets the capital really into motion, and accordingly draws from it compound interest, 
and [XVIII-1068] can easily pledge himself to pay the giver simple interest. Finally 
the law of consumption, greed, waste reacts against that immense progression in 
which the forces of man and their product would tend to increase, if the law of 
production or frugality alone were to hold sway" (A. Müller, Die Elemente der 
Staatskunst, Berlin, 1809, Part III, [pp.] 147-49). 
It would be impossible within a few lines to jumble together 
more hair-raising and self-contradictory nonsense. We do not 
mention the ludicrous confusion of worker and capitalist, of value 
of labour capacity and interest on capital, etc.—let us just mention 
the assertion that the decline in compound interest is due, among 
other things, to the fact that capital is "lent out", whereupon it 
"then"  brings "compound interest". The extraordinary shallowness 
of this "profundity" or RATHER "stupidity", this for example: 
"In determining the price of things time is not an issue; in determining interest 
it is time which chiefly comes into consideration" (I.e., [pp.] 137-38). 
Müller is speaking here of circulation time. Since he sees 
circulation time as determining in the case of interest, but does not 
see this in the case of the price of the commodity, the profundity

consists in holding fast to the semblance and reasoning forth on 
this basis. The same fellow tells us: 
"Urban  production is bound to the cycle of  days;  rural production in contrast to 
the cycle of  years"  (I.e.,  [p.] 178). 
By "urban production" he means manufacture in contrast to 
agriculture. Agriculture which is not run in the capitalist 
fashion—and this is what he refers to—is of course bound to the 
annual cycle. Large-scale manufacturing on the other hand (IN 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE FIXED CAPITAL EMPLOYED) is bound tO the Cycle of  1 2 tO 
15, in some branches of the transport industry (railways, etc.) 20 
years.  Our Müller's procedure is characteristic of Romanticism in 
all its manifestations. Its content consists of the most vulgar 
everyday prejudices, trivialities created from superficial appear­
ances.  This false and trivial content then has to be "heightened" 
and made poetical by a mystificatory mode of expression. 
[XVIII-1068] Assume that there are 5  WHOLESALE  DEALERS  for the 
100 SHOPKEEPERS. They have therefore to sell to the shopkeepers 
every year 544,500 worth of value, and in Vs of a year 108,900 
worth of commodity value. For which they, however, only receive 
a payment of 107,800 from the SHOPKEEPERS. 
Each of the 5  WHOLESALE  DEALERS  has in Vs of a year to sell to 20 
RETAILERS.  I.e. each has to sell a commodity value of £21,780, for 
which he receives 21,560 in money. But for this 21,560 each 
WHOLESALE  dealer must d'abord receive from the PRODUCER a commodi­
ty value of £21,780. Indeed, he must receive more than this, since 
he also has to make his profit. Assume that his capital circulates 5 
times in the year. All 5 buy over the year from the PRODUCER for 
539,000. But they do this with a capital of 107,800. 10% on this 
makes £10,780 over the year. And over a fifth of a year this 
makes £2,156. The profit for each of the 5  WHOLESALE  DEALERS  every 
Vs of a year is therefore £431 Vs- Each of the WHOLESALE DEALERS 
therefore buys from the capitalist every Vs of a year commodities 
to the value of £21,780 for £21,560 money minus £431 Vs. He 
therefore pays £21,128 4/5 for the commodities, or 5 pay 105,644 
every Vs of a year, and 528,220 over the whole year. The 
producer therefore has in fact to provide a commodity value of 
544,500 for 528,220—if we disregard the value addition made by 
the RETAILER—the  difference thus does not come even to 3'/2% of 
the commodity value provided by the capitalist. 
The only thing of importance here is that the interposition of 
the WHOLESALERS  in no way alters the circuit, described above, 

=====第237页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements  of Money 227 
between  the  épicier,  the producer  and the  worker; except that here 
the workers  are not  only workers  of class  I, who  produce means  of 
subsistence  for the  WORKMEN.  The  RETAILER  [XVIII-1069] does  not 
put in his  pocket  the  whole  of the  reduction  in the  price  at which 
the PRODUCER  sells  him the  commodity; instead this reduction  is 
divided between  WHOLESALER  and  RETAILER.  In  other words, what  is 
divided  is the  part  of the  surplus value which amounts  to 
MERCANTILE PROFIT.  Instead of the  MONEY WAGES PAID BY ONE CAPITALIST  TO HIS 
OWN WORKMEN  [being]  RETURNED  TO HIM  BY THE SHOPKEEPER  (but now for the 
re-purchase  not  only  of wages  in commodities,  but  of the  profit  of 
the SHOPKEEPER)  the  MONEY WAGES  of all  WORKMEN  of classes I and II flow 
back  to the  producers  of  class  I through  the  SHOPKEEPER  and the 
WHOLESALERS  (in the  re-purchase  of the  commodities falling  to the 
share  of the  workers+the realisation  in commodities  of the  profit 
of the  WHOLESALERS  and  RETAILERS).  With part  of  this reflux  the 
producers  of class  I replace  in money their variable capital,  and 
with the  other part they  buy  constant capital from class  II, who 
with this money again obtain  the  MONEY  fund from which they  pay 
wages. 
The situation  for  shopkeepers  and  wholesalers  B, who  sell 
means  of subsistence  to the  owners  and  consumers  of the  SURPLUS, 
is the same as for  SHOPKEEPERS  and  WHOLESALERS  A. 
We saw  that the  product  of the  producers  of class  I, however 
many  of  them there might  be, was  collected  in 5  WHOLESALE 
reservoirs,  and  then divided into  100  RETAIL  reservoirs, then 
entered  PIECEMEAL,  by the day and by the  hour, into  the  circulation 
between  RETAILER  and  CONSUMER.  With  the  REFLUX  of the  money,  on 
the other hand,  no  such constantly increasing subdivision takes 
place  as with  the  circulation  of the  commodity.  On the  contrary. 
The workers' money  is concentrated  in the 100  RETAILERS,  then 
collected into  5 reservoirs  at the  WHOLESALERS,  and is  only re-divided 
once  it returns  to the  individual producers. 
In the  case  of the  circulation  of the  commodity there  is a  mere 
TRANSFER from PRODUCER  tO  WHOLESALER, from WHOLESALER  tO  RETAILER,  and 
it is the  last who  sells  it definitively. Similarly  in the  reverse 
direction, with  the  REFLUX, TRANSFER,  of the  money which flows back 
to the  capitalist  (REFLUX  of capital, when  he  sells  on  credit,  but 
REFLUX  of MONEY  and  indeed  as means  of purchase  or  REFLUX  of the 
MONEY FORM  of his  capital when  he  sells  for  CASH)  from  the  RETAILER  to 
the WHOLESALER,  from  the  WHOLESALER  to the  producer. 
The situation  is  entirely  the  same with  the  MERCHANTS  who 
mediate  the  purchase  and  sale of constant capital,  i.e. buy and  sell 
for industrial consumption. Here  too the  profit derives from  the 

=====第238页=====
228 Capital and Profit 
fact that they buy the commodity below its value and sell it at its 
value, thus receiving their share in its surplus value. This 
circulation in itself has no particular significance. E.g. the 
WHOLESALER buys yarn from the spinner, sells it to the weaver, or 
buys flax from the FARMER and sells it to the linen yarn 
manufacturer. In fact it is the weaver who pays the spinner. The 
circulation of these particular mercantile capitals, through their 
constant sale of a particular commodity, conceals the real 
movement, the real connection. Everything e.g. which appears in 
the circulation between flax producer, MERCHANT and spinner is 
nothing but a constant buying by the spinner from the flax 
producer. Every individual act of the reproduction process thus 
appears divided and in an independent shape. 
We now come to accumulation. 
//But first still one more point. It is very important in 
estimating the GENERAL SURPLUS VALUE to include mercantile profit, 
because a part of the  SURPLUS  VALUE  is concealed here and appears to 
arise out of a specific sphere of production.// 
But now back to p. 1065, Notebook  XVII,  1) and 3) (accumulation 
and the gold producer).* We have in the reproduction process 
1) the class of producers who produce means of subsistence, the 
elements into which the variable capital and the part of the 
product produced as surplus value and expended as income are 
resolved, 
2) the class of producers who produce the constant capital for the 
first class. This consists in the final analysis of the classes which 
provide the latter with elements of constant capital, hence raw 
materials, seeds (whether corn or breeding cattle. In the animal 
kingdom the seed is the cattle  itself,  in the vegetable kingdom it is 
the actual seeds), and produce the machines, containers and tools 
(we see even in agriculture how seed production, whether in the 
animal or the plant kingdom, can split away from production for 
consumption as an independent sphere of production). 
[XVIII-1070] A house can of course serve as constant capital or 
enter into individual consumption, or both at once. Coal, wood, a 
horse, a wagon, a mass of small instruments and containers enter 
as constant parts of consumption, as tools of consumption. This 
makes no difference. In so far as the producers sell to individual 
consumers they belong to class I, in so far as they sell to 
producers, to class II. In one category things apply to them which 
pertain to that category; in the other, things which pertain to the 
other.

Alongside these classes  the  producer  of the  commodities which 
function  as money,  the  producer  of the  precious metals, forms  a 
category  sui generis.3  For the  sake  of simplification,  we only speak 
of the  gold producer  as the  producer  of the  material  of money. 
For the  sake  of simplification (since  the  countries which produce 
the precious metals have peculiar characteristics which  are 
irrelevant  to  this general investigation)  we  place  the  gold 
producers  in the  middle  of the  country  of capitalist production 
itself. 
Incidentally,  we  have excluded foreign trade  for the  same 
reason149 ; exporter  and  importer  are  themselves merely categories 
of WHOLESALE DEALERS.  The  exporter exports means  of subsistence 
which enter  in finished form into consumption:  in this case  he 
belongs  to the  WHOLESALE  DEALERS,  who do  nothing  in the  reproduc­
tion process  but  mediate  the  TRANSFER  to the  RETAILERS  of the 
product, which then flows directly into  the sphere  of consumption. 
Or he  exports  raw  materials, semi-manufactures, instrumental 
materials, machines, instruments  of labour.  In  this case  he 
mediates  the  exchange between  the  producers themselves.  In the 
one case  it is C—M, in the  other case  M—C, the  conversion  of 
commodity capital into money,  or of  money capital into com­
modities. There  is therefore  no essential difference between these 
and the two  main categories  of WHOLESALE  DEALERS.  But the  importer 
is the  same  as the  exporter.  The  exporter  of one  country  is the 
importer  for the  other  one, and the  importer  of one  country  is the 
exporter  for  another  one.  There  are of  course exporters  and 
importers  in one  single country,  e.g.  England.  But the  exporter 
imports into other countries,  and the  importer exports  out of 
other countries. 
Gold enters  as raw  material  and  matière instrumentale into a 
series  of luxury products.  In so far as the  gold producer sells  his 
gold to the  producers  of these articles,  he belongs  to class  II, 
which sells  and  produces  the  elements  of constant capital. 
Every part  of the  product equally contains  a portion  of surplus 
value. Every individual commodity  or portion  of a  commodity 
considered  in itself.  (Nevertheless,  our  distinction also appears  in 
practice.  If 2  thirds  of the  product consist  of costs,  Vs of  SURPLUS, 
and the  capitalist only sold  7s, he  would only have replaced  his 
variable capital;  if he  sold  2/s he  would have replaced  his variable 
and constant capital,  and  would have realised  no profit, although 
every part  of the  commodity,  and  every individual commodity,

would have been equally sold at its production price, hence would 
have realised a part of the SURPLUS VALUE.) The gold producer 
realises just as much profit on this part as on every other part; 
because unpaid labour is contained in the gold and he realises this 
pro rata. But only formally. For he receives no other commodity. 
But instead converts the gold from the form of bars into the 
money form, which he could also do by sending it to the mint. 
(There is of course a difference for him between places where it is 
coined free of charge, as in England, and where seigneuriage is 
charged as in France.) It emerges clearly in his case that the 
surplus value arises not from circulation but from production, 
because in production it already possesses the form in which it is 
capable of circulation. But this circulation between the gold 
producer and the gold consuming producer is important on 
account of one point. In this TRADE the gold producer withdraws 
money from circulation instead of throwing it in; for the gold that 
he throws in does not enter into circulation as money but as an 
element of production. 
Therefore in a country where gold mines, etc., are located, we 
find AVERAGE productive consumption of gold, just as of all other 
commodities which form the object or the matière instrumentale of 
other commodities. If in this case this consumption were so large 
as to cover the wages [of the workers] of the gold producer and 
his profit (hence the part he spends as income) two things could 
be said: 
1) The whole of this part of the annual gold production does 
not enter circulation as money; it neither enters as CURRENCY into 
the circulation between RETAILER and INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER (COIN) nor 
does it enter as money capital into the TRANSACTIONS between the 
productive consumers. //The difference between coin and money 
exists here in so  FAR as the money capital is paid out to the worker 
in coin, because it has to circulate in the circulation between 
RETAILER and DEFINITIVE CONSUMER; whereas in the spheres in which it 
moves between the productive consumers, i.e. the productive 
capitalists, it does not enter into this circulation, serves chiefly as 
means of payment and in their hands ceases to represent capital, 
which is what it does do in the HANDS of the DEFINITIVE  CONSUMERS.  The 
simultaneity and parallel course of the different successive phases 
of circulation, which at the same time represent opposite phases 
for different capitals, brings about the difference between the 
kinds of money, in which capital circulates on the one hand and 
income on the other. The transition from one kind of money to 
the other is mediated through exchange.//

[XVIII-1071]  2) There takes place here  a REFLUX  of money (from 
circulation)  to the  gold producer,  and  this  REFLUX  repeats  itself.  If 
e.g. the  gold  CONSUMER (GOLDSMITH,  etc.)  pays  him 4  times  a year,  or 
buys from  him  every quarter, here  in the  case  we  have supposed 
this is money flowing from circulation itself  for the  payment  of 
wages.  The  gold producer would only need  to have  in reserve  in 
coin the  expression  of  wages  for a  quarter  of a  year, since  the 
same amount flows back  to him  again from circulation every 
quarter.  The  GOLDSMITH,  etc.,  in contrast, replaces  his  money capital, 
which  he  laid  out in the  purchase  of gold, with  the  money which 
comes from  the  SPENDERS  OF REVENUE,  to whom  the  gold producer 
would himself  in  part belong.  If  this consumption  of  gold 
amounted  to a  sufficiently considerable part,  it would provide  for 
the gold producer  not  only  the  money  for  wages,  but  also  for the 
income  PART  (what is  SPENT  as income)  OF THE PRODUCERS PROFIT  (RENT). 
Here  it must  be  borne  in mind that  the  gold producer, like every 
other capitalist, needs  ONLY AN  ALIQUOT  PART,  AND A RELATIVELY SMALL  PART, 
of the  YEARLY MONEY EXPRESSION  of the  WAGES,  in order to pay them, and 
that in spending  his own  income  he  also only needs  A MUCH SMALLER 
MONEY EXPRESSION OF ITS YEARLY VALUE,  since  the  same money flows back 
and performs  the  service anew. 
Assume that  the  GOLD PRODUCER  has to pay his  workers £12,000 
annually. This makes £1,000  a month,  and say  £240  a week,  if 50 
weeks  are  worked  in the  year. Assume that this producer advances 
the money weekly  at the  beginning  of the  first quarter,  and,  since 
it does  not  flow back  to him,  for the  whole  of the  quarter.  At the 
end of the  quarter  he  makes  a sale  for  £3,000  (if the  year=50 
weeks,  the  quarter=12'/2 weeks  and the  week=£240).  To the 
goldsmith,  etc. In the  second quarter, therefore,  he no  longer  has 
to increase  the  CURRENCY  by a  further £3,000,  but  instead  he retains 
this £3,000  in his own  possession  or  with  his  BANKER,  and  allows 
£240  of it to  flow back into circulation every week. There  is no 
doubt that this would  be the  case  in an  industrial country. Only  a 
small part  of the  product would  be  necessary,  and  this would  be 
sold to the  productive consumers  of gold  so that  in this  way  there 
would  be a  constant reflux  of the  wage from circulation.  For  this 
part of the  gold producer's capital, therefore,  and,  depending  on 
the circumstances, also for the  MONETARY EXPRESSION  OF HIS REVENUE,  he 
adds nothing  to circulation,  in so far as its  movement  is between 
INDIVIDUAL  CONSUMERS  and  PRODUCERS.  This circumstance  is entirely 
overlooked  by  Ricardo  in a hypothesis  he  bases  on the  assumption 
that the  gold mine  is to be  found  in the  country  of capitalist 
production  itself,  e.g.  England. 150

232 Capital and Profit 
A money  REFLUX  would take place for this part of the gold 
producer's product, because he sells the gold as a commodity, does 
not buy with it, does not spend it as money. 
//Within capitalist production cost price]5] never=value. Produc­
tion price can=value, if the coincidence occurs that 1) the capital 
which gives the commodity its final form, and 2) the capital which 
provides the machine and the raw material, both have the  AVERAGE 
ORGANIC COMPOSITION.  Just as the production prices of the com­
modities which form the variable capital may always vary in their 
value, the amount of these commodities, which forms the wage, 
always=the labour time (ON AN  AVERAGE)  the worker needs to 
reproduce this amount, = the value of the labour capacity for which 
the variable part of the capital is exchanged. This part, whatever 
its price,=its value. It is therefore sufficient for the other two 
parts—surplus value and constant capital — to possess the  AVERAGE 
COMPOSITION,  for the production price of the commodity to be equal 
to its value.// 
In what follows, therefore, we entirely leave à part the part of 
the gold which enters as raw material into the production of other 
commodities, hence into the constant capital of other spheres of 
production. 
As far as concerns the position of the gold producer for gold 
production  (THUS CIRCUMSCRIBED),  this is sui generis. The product, the 
commodity he has produced, cannot enter as an element either 
into the constant or into the variable capital of other spheres of 
production, and it therefore does not enter into the real 
reproduction process as considered above. Nor does it enter into 
his own constant or variable capital. Just as little does it enter into 
the category of commodities in which income is  IMMEDIATELY SPENT. 
On the other hand, however, this commodity directly possesses the 
form in which it can enter into the world market as money, just as 
it can be converted into national money through a merely 
technical transformation. It may function directly as money, i.e. 
buy. The converted form of the commodity is its primitive form. 
And it therefore also directly possesses the absolute form of 
circulating capital, the form of money capital. 
The gold producer can therefore buy directly, without having to 
sell.  His COMMODITY IS IMMEDIATELY CONVERTIBLE  INTO  EVERY OTHER COMMODITY, 
WITHOUT ANY REGARD  to its relation to the productive conditions of existence 
of the commodities for which it [XVIII-1072] is exchanged; the 
commodities it buys. 
We have transferred the gold producer to a country of capitalist 
production. What applies to every other sphere of capitalist 

=====第243页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 233 
production applies to this one: it can only absorb its proportional 
part of capital and labour, if the rate of profit is not to fall below 
the AVERAGE PROFIT.  In other spheres of production, where surplus 
value can be resolved into profit and rent, a relative oversupply of 
the sphere with capital would initially affect rent alone; the turn of 
profit would come when the relative oversupply of the sphere with 
capital and labour persisted, even after profit had swallowed up 
the rent. Assume that the capital invested in gold production 
yielded 30%, 10  PROFIT  and 20 rent. If a given amount more of 
capital and labour were applied to this sphere, and corresponding­
ly more withdrawn from the other spheres, the means of 
subsistence and the constant capital of the gold producer (i.e. the 
machines, etc., he must buy) would rise for instance from 100 to 
120. This 120 would as before express numerically the same 
physical amount of means of production, i.e. the same amount of 
labour, and the same ratio as previously of machinery, etc., to this 
given amount of labour. The product would be as before 130, 
whether the capital laid out=100, 110, or 120. If we take the last 
figure, not only would the rent have disappeared, but also nearly 
20% of the profit. For 120:10=100:8 7s- Thus the rent of 
20 would have vanished and the profit would have fallen from 10 
to 8'/s%-  The capital and labour employed in gold production 
therefore stands in a certain proportion to the amount of capital 
employed in all other spheres of production, or is brought back to 
this through the equalisation of the rate of profit. 
The producer of the gold can buy what he wants with it (i.e. 
what commodities he finds on the market); hence means of 
subsistence on the one hand; instruments of production on the 
other. He can consume, in this form, the part of his gold product 
which represents surplus value (profit, rent),  IN FACT HOARD WITH  A VIEW 
TO CONVERT IT AT  A LATER  PERIOD  EITHER  INTO  REVENUE OR  INTO  CAPITAL. In so far 
as he does this, the gold producer accumulates a part of his 
product in natural form, just as the peasant or the machine 
manufacturer does. 
As regards the part he exchanged for means of subsistence or 
instruments of production, the part of the product sold to him by 
the producers of those commodities now exists entirely in gold, i.e. 
in a form in which the reproduction process of their commodities 
cannot be renewed. If they are to reproduce at the same level, the 
same part of their product (assuming that  NO CHANGE  has occurred 
in the value of the ingredients of their production) must be 
converted back into raw materials, machinery, etc. For example, 
those who sell the means of subsistence, i.e. commodities in their 

=====第244页=====
234 Capital and Profit 
final form, the form in which they enter into individual 
consumption, cannot use gold either as a raw material (semi­
manufactured material), or as a matière instrumentale (for this has 
already been withdrawn for GOLDSMITHS, etc.), or to replace their 
means of production. It is implied, furthermore, that the 
circulation is already sufficiently  FULL  TO REPLACE  BY ITS FLUX  AND  REFLUX 
ALL VARIABLE CAPITAL IN THE FORM OF MONEY, etc.; similarly the part of the 
circulating capital which must circulate as money capital. From the 
means of subsistence this class has sold to the gold producer, and 
IN RETURN for which it now possesses gold, it can accumulate in gold 
the surplus value contained in these commodities; it can hold onto 
the gold as the form of the surplus value; it can store up, 
preserve, retain this surplus value in the form of gold. But it must 
replace the raw material, machinery (it is assumed that the 
production of gold for luxury consumption replaces the CURRENCY 
for the gold PRODUCER, without his having to throw other money 
into circulation to achieve this; but the part of the commodity that 
he consumes—and, apart from this, the part of the labour that is 
contained in the commodity consumed by him—must be replaced 
by its producers through the purchase of new labour 43); for we 
assume that the previous circulation was sufficient to pay out the 
variable capital in money. The producer of the means of 
subsistence therefore buys with the part of the gold which he has 
obtained—the part he keeps as the direct form of his surplus 
value (profit)—semi-manufactured material, matières instrumentales, 
MACHINERY, etc. The producers of these commodities are all in the 
same position. Each one can only retain a portion of the gold=a 
part of his profit or surplus value in general. With the other part 
he replaces the raw material, etc. For this last part of the gold, 
which comes to the original producer, they sell their whole 
commodity, pro toto, with deduction of exchanges between the 
original producers, and they cannot again split up this part into a 
PART consisting OF SURPLUS VALUE and a PART consisting OF PRODUCTIVE 
CAPITAL. For them this gold therefore represents nothing but the 
part of their surplus value accumulated in gold. And the 
commodities they thus sell indirectly to the gold producer 
constitute a part of the part of their product in which surplus 
value is realised. 
We have observed the course of events where the gold producer 
buys means of subsistence. THE  SAME  CASE  AS FAR  AS HE BUYS  INSTRUMENTS  OF 
PRODUCTION AND matières instrumentales. [XVIII-1073] Hence the 
whole annual product of the gold producer //we are deliberately 
leaving foreign trade out of the picture here// can be resolved into 

=====第245页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements of Money 235 
the expression of surplus value in gold; it is a part of the SURPLUS 
LABOUR of the WHOLE SOCIETY which is directly incarnated in gold, 
converted into gold. For the gold producer, as for any other 
capitalist, his total product consists of 1) a part which reproduces 
the constant capital; 2) a part which replaces the variable capital; 
and 3) a third part which represents the SURPLUS VALUE. But in 
relation to the whole society it is merely the incarnation of SURPLUS 
VALUE and  SURPLUS  LABOUR. To the extent that this  SURPLUS  VALUE  comes 
into consideration, the gold producer is distinguished from the 
others only in that for him it is a form emerging directly from the 
process of production, whereas for the others it is mediated 
through exchange, through circulation. The other producers— 
whether of means of subsistence or of constant capital—exchange, 
out of the part of their product which represents surplus value, a 
part for the gold of the gold producer; they thus replace his 
capital for him and he gives them the commodity in which they 
realise a part of their surplus value. The relation of the gold 
producer to classes I and II is therefore exactly the same as the 
relation of classes I and II to each other. That is, the whole of his 
annual product can be resolved into income, i.e. it is exchanged 
for a part of the means of subsistence and means of production 
which represent income for their producers, i.e. realisation  OF 
SURPLUS  LABOUR.  Just as class I realised a part of its  SURPLUS  VALUE  in its 
own products, so also can the gold producer. But he can realise 
only a part. He must consume a part of his SURPLUS VALUE. The 
others, in contrast, must not consume a part of their  SURPLUS  VALUE, 
if they want to possess it in the form of gold. Therefore, in so far 
as this form of replacement comes into consideration, the 
exchange between the gold producer and the other classes does 
not represent a new phenomenon. But it is a new phenomenon in 
so far as a part of the SURPLUS VALUE is here directly converted into 
the material of money and thereby the simple reproduction 
process assumes the special feature that the valorisation of the 
commodity presents itself directly as accumulation of gold, hence 
as accumulation of latent money capital. 
If we leave aside the form of capitalist production, it is clear that 
the producers must exchange a part of their products with each 
other, in part for individual consumption, in part for productive 
consumption. This part (and it forms  BY  FAR  THE GREATEST  PART  OF THEIR 
PRODUCE) can  ON  AN AVERAGE  be regarded as given, particularly in static 
conditions, such as were normal before the capitalist mode of 
production. They can only exchange the  SURPLUS  with the product 
of the gold or silver producer. And in fact their hoards are formed

in this manner,  and in  general  the  basis  is laid for the  circulation 
of metallic money.  The  situation that only this surplus  can be 
converted into gold remains  the  same  in capitalist production. 
In so far as the  gold producer  and the  other producers  now 
convert their [surplus] into capital anew  as money  (in addition  to 
the money otherwise circulating amongst them),  the  question  is 
not specific.  The  same conditions  are  needed  as are  required  in 
general  for the  conversion  of money into capital. 
So far,  therefore,  we  merely have this:  The  accumulation  of 
money—as identical with  new  gold production—requires that  a 
part of the  surplus labour  of the  country should  be invested  in the 
production  of gold. 
But now let us  pose  the  question  in a  different form,  in which 
the production  of new  gold  is entirely left  on one  side.  It is  known 
that during  a considerable period  of time, roughly from  1808 to 
1830,  the  newly added gold  and  silver were exactly sufficient  to 
replace  the  abrasion,  etc., the  WEAR  AND  TEAR,  of the  money capital  of 
Europe.  The  capitalist accumulation process must also  be consi­
dered  in itself—precisely with regard  to money—without bringing 
in the  production  of gold  and  silver  at all. 
The question that concerns  us here  is not the  same  as the one 
considered previously,  in dealing with reproduction:  how  surplus 
value existing  as money,  or  RATHER  the  part  of the  surplus value 
which  is not  consumed,  can be  converted back into productive 
capital.  The question is rather how, and  UNDER  WHAT  CONDITIONS,  a 
part of the  surplus value, INSTEAD  OF BEING SPENT,  MAY BE  ACCUMULATED  AS 
MONEY,  AND  THIS WITHOUT  ANY  REGARD  TO THE  EXCHANGE WITH  THE  GOLD  OR  SILVER 
PRODUCING CAPITALIST? 
Let us consider  the  different classes: 
class I, which produces means  of subsistence; 
class II, which produces  the  constant capital  for  those means  of 
subsistence  and the  constant capital  for  this constant capital; 
claSS  III, THE  MERCANTILE  AND  MONIED CAPITAL,  WHO  ONLY INTERMEDIATE  THE 
MOVEMENTS AMONGST  THE TWO  FIRST CLASSES. 
[XVIII-1074]  On  class  I. This class  has to  replace  its constant 
and variable capital.  It replaces  the  latter through  its own 
products,  it buys  the  former through exchange  for its  products. 
As regards  the  surplus value, class  I must itself consume  a part 
of it; but its  whole product,  * surplus value  as well  as capital, exists 
in the  form  of commodities destined  for  immediate consumption, 
or destined,  at least,  to fall into  the  funds  of consumption,  and, 
thereby,  to be got rid of in the  sphere  of circulation.  It must  be 
sold, before  any  part  of it  exists  in the  form  of money;  and the 

=====第247页=====
Episode. Reflux Movements  of Money  237 
sale of it  means  its being bought  for  consumption.* This  is what 
the part  of the  product which represents SURPLUS VALUE  has in 
common with  the  part which represents capital.  * If,  therefore, 
that class need only consume part  of its  surplus produce  itself, the 
whole surplus produce must  be consumed—and, therefore, sold 
to consumers.  If not, it  will encumber their warehouses  in the 
form  of not  consumed  and  unvendible commodities.* 
According  to our  presupposition, class  I exchanges with class  II 
only the  part  of its  product which represents  its constant capital, 
hence  NO  PART OF REVENUE. When dealing with this question, there­
fore,  the  exchange with this class must  *be  left out of  considera­
tion altogether,  as far as  class  I is  concerned.  We are  thrown back 
upon [class  I] itself. 
Within clasj  I itself, the  exchange with  the  workmen must  be 
also eliminated.  The  workmen  of class  II are  already included  in 
the exchange  of class  I with  II, which exchange,  we say, is to be 
eliminated. Their  own  workmen only  pay  them back  in money  the 
value  of the  capital paid  out to  them  in commodities. This 
exchange  has  nothing  at all to do  with  the  realisation  of the 
surplus value,  but  only with  the  variable capital advanced. 
We are  then forced  to consider  the parties  of class  I itself,  which 
share  in the  surplus value produced  in it, and who by  their exchanges 
return  to the  producing capitalist  the  monetary value partly  of his 
capital advanced, partly  of his  profit. Neither  the  exchange with 
class  II, nor the  payment  of the  variable capital within class  I, has 
anything  to do  with  the  question thus put.* 
We have seen  how a  part  of the  capital  can  accumulate  as 
money capital,  in so  FAR as not  only  the  part  of income which  the 
gold producer consumes  in natura,  but the  part  of his  product 
(gold) which  he must give  in natura  in exchange,  in order  to 
replace  his  capital (leaving aside  the  part  of this product that  he 
sells as raw  material  to other branches  of production), both 
constitute  a part  of the  income  of the  other producers,  a part 
which  is retained directly  in the  shape  of gold,  is initially HOARDED 
gold,  and can  then function  as money capital  in reality,  i.e. enter 
directly into  the  accumulation process  of capital. 
The question  we now  pose  is this: Leaving aside this part  of the 
SURPLUS  VALUE,  which  is accumulated through exchange with  the gold 
producer  in the  shape  of gold,  how is it  possible  at all for 
productive capital initially  to pocket  as gold  a part  of its  income, 
instead  of spending  it, and  then  to accumulate this part  as money 
capital? 
The capitalist  has  laid  out £100. His  commodity = 110.  In our

presentation  so far,  where  the  surplus value  of 10  BEYOND THE CAPITAL 
BECOMES MONETISED,  we  assumed that  the  income  was  entirely eaten 
Up; SO  THAT  IN  FACT  THE  MONEY SPENT  IN THE  CONSUMPTION  OF THE  REVENUE 
monetises  the  surplus value,  PAYS  IT BACK.  But if the  capitalist  (and 
EACH  CAPITALIST,  for the  matter must  be  conceived  in a  general  way; 
as a process of capital,  NOT  OF ONE  SINGLE  CAPITALIST  AT  THE  EXPENSE  OF 
OTHERS,  so that  e.g. the  sale  by one  capitalist  of 110, of  which  he 
only  SPENDS  105, is not  explained  by  saying  THAT ANOTHER IS UNABLE TO 
SELL  PART OF HIS PRODUCE)  replaces 100,  SPENDS  5 AND  ACCUMULATES  5, HOW  is 
THIS  TO BE MANAGED ON A GENERAL SCALE? THAT IS THE QUESTION TO BE PUT  AND  TO 
BE ANSWERED. 
Just as a  part  of the  produce  of particular spheres  of production 
enters into them again  as a  condition  [of  production], this 
consideration would  be  important  if we  were  to examine  a specific 
sphere  of production  of class  I. But  here  it is not  important.  Let 
100 represent  the  total capital  of this class  and 10 its  total profit.  It 
must consume  a part  in natura  (i.e. in the  product  of this class 
itself  in  natura).  Say 5. The  question  is  thus: under what 
conditions  can  this class keep back  5 as  money,  FIRST  conditions  for 
the reconversion  of income into capital?  The  first condition  is that 
it sells  for 105. The  100—replacement  of the  capital—is 
explained,  and  therefore does  not  come into consideration  any 
further here.  The  question  is, to  whom  are the  commodities  to the 
value  of £5  sold? They consist  of  commodities which  in  part 
merely enter into  the  income  of the  higher classes,  in part enter 
into the  consumption  of the  workers, productive  or unproductive.

[XVIII-1075] * MERCANTILE* CAPITAL [CONTINUED] 
On the  DISTRIBUTION  OF  CAPITAL AMONG  THE  DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS  1S : 
"CAPITAL  IS DIRECTED  TO  DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS  BY THE  RATE  OF  PROFITS.  This 
GENERAL PRINCIPLE  is modified  by:  * 1) the  difficulties connected with  a change  of 
investment;  2) the  risk which attends different investments. Risk  of losses* 
determined  by the  INSURANCE SOCIETIES.  But  there  is also *the risk  of success. 
Should  we  take into account  the  many losses sustained  by the  community  of 
merchants,  the  number  of failures,  as well as the instances  of uncommon success,  it 
would  be found, that  the  average rate  of profit  in commerce, does  not  differ from 
that of capital, when vested  in other branches  of production"  (S. P. Newman, 
Elements  of Political Economy, Andover  and  New  York,  1835, [pp.]  83-85). 
"In the  existing economical arrangements  of society,  the  very  act,  which  is 
performed  by the  merchant,  of standing between  the  producer  and  consumer, 
advancing  to the  former capital  and  receiving products  in return,  and  then 
handing over these products  to the  latter, receiving back capital  in return,  is a 
transaction, which both facilitates  the  economical processes  of the community,  and 
adds value  to the  products  in relation  to which  it is  performed"* (I.e.,  [p.] 174). 
"Time is saved for the  MANUFACTURER  and the  CONSUMER  by his intervention 
and money. This * service requires  an  outlay  of capital  and  labour  * and  must, 
* since  it adds value  to products,  for the same products  in the hands  of consumers  are worth 
more than  in the hands  of producers*"  [p.  175], 
// this  is absolutely wrong.  The use  value  of a  commodity  is greater 
IN THE HAND OF THE CONSUMER THAN  IN THAT OF THE PRODUCER, because  it is 
only then that  it is  REALISED  at all.  * The value  in use of the 
commodity only becomes realised  by  passing into  the  sphere  of 
consumption.  In the  hand  of the producer  it exists  in a  latent form 
only.  But I do not pay a  commodity twice over, first  its value  in 
exchange,  and  secondly  its value  in use. By  paying  its value  in 
exchange,  I appropriate  its value  in use.  Its value  in exchange  is not 
augmented  by  passing from  the  producer  to the  consumer*//,

240 Capital  and  Profit 
"Let us say  that trade  is useful,  but let us not  say: trade  is productive"  (F. Vidal, 
De la répartition  des  richesses  etc.,  Paris,  1846, [p.] 198). a 
A very good work  on mercantile capital  is: Corbet (Thomas),  An 
Inquiry into  the  Causes  and  Modes  of the  Wealth  of Individuals;  or the 
Principles  of  Trade  and  Speculation Explained, London,  1841. 
Corbet does not pretend to give the  GENERAL PRINCIPLES  OF POLITICAL 
ECONOMY  here.  He  conceives mercantile capital  as  something 
specific,  and he  describes  its  specific mode  of  operation.  The 
connection between mercantile capital and the  GENERAL PRINCIPLES  IS 
RATHER LOOSELY  more hinted  at than developed.  Yet,  this is not the 
task Corbet sets himself.  He  leaves  it to the  GENERAL ECONOMIST.  We 
shall  now go  through some  of Corbet's main points. 
* "All trade consists  in the  exchange  of things  of  different kinds;  and the 
advantage arises  out of  this difference.  To  exchange  a pound  of bread against  a 
pound  of  bread  ...  would  be  attended with  no  advantage  ...  hence trade  is 
advantageously contrasted with gambling, which consists  in the  mere exchange  of money 
for money"* (I.e.,  [p.] 5). 
With C— M—C the  ADVANTAGE  arises from  the  difference 
between  C and C", i.e. the use  values exchanged.  The  com­
modities  are  only realised  as use  values through this exchange,  by 
passing  out of the  hand  in which they  are  merely repositories  of 
exchange value into  the  hand  in which they  are  really  use  values. 
Exchange value appears  as a  mere form  for the  mediation  of this 
process,  and no  alteration  in the  exchange value  is IMPLIED IN IT.  The 
whole movement  of  [XVIII-1076] capital M—C—AT,  on the 
other hand,  IMPLIES  THE  QUALITATIVE IDENTITY  OF THE  EXTREMES  M and M'. 
* If no  alteration were implied  in the  quantity  of the  extremes,  the 
operation would  be  tautological, silly  and  useless.  And in  fact, 
suppose  a merchant  has  bought commodities  for £100 and the 
state  of the  market forces  him to  again sell them  for  £100.  It is 
the same  as if he had  kept  the  original £100  in his  hands,  as far as 
he is concerned  or his £100 are  concerned.  If he  were forced  to 
sell them  for  less, [which]  may  happen,  the  operation implies  a 
positive loss, which  can  never  be its  purpose  or its  aim.* This  is 
the general formula for capital, whether  INDUSTRIAL  OR  MERCANTILE. 
And whether  the  trade  is in  commodities  or money.  It is  always 
buying  in order  to sell; hence,  if we  leave aside  the  CHANGE  IN THE 
QUANTITY  o? M',  AS COMPARED WITH  M, * it is the exchange of money for 
money,  of value  in exchange  for  value  in exchange. There  is no 
difference  in the  kinds  of the  commodities exchanged. Hence  no 
advantage arising  out of  that difference.* Thus according  to Corbet 
a Marx quotes from Vidal  in French.— Ed. 

=====第251页=====
Mercantile Capital [Continued] 241 
every MOVEMENT of capital would be * gambling, and the difference 
between gambling properly so called and other kinds of capitalistic 
gambling would amount to this: In the one case //but this is also 
the case with all the operations of the monied capital properly so 
called// the exchange of money for money is concealed by 
intermediate movements; in the other case it is not. The gambler 
directly (and he shares this with the capital-lending capitalist, the 
banker, etc.) puts out money to gain more money or to lose the 
money put out. The productive capitalist, whether industrial or 
commercial, first exchanges his money for the commodity, to 
afterwards exchange the commodity for money. In the one 
instance the exchange of money for money is undisguised, direct, 
sans phrase. In the other instances it is concealed by intermediate 
movements, but does always appear as the result of the complex 
movements.* If Corbet therefore calls GAMBLING GAMBLING because it 
is EXCHANGE OF MONEY FOR  MONEY,  EVERY MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL RESOLVES INTO 
GAMBLING. This is why e.g. Pinto regards trade as "un jeu"." But 
since this jeu would soon have to come to an end if this operation 
were to continue, if only one side gained, an alternation would 
have to take place: now one side, now the other, would have to be 
THE LOSING OR THE WINNING PARTY. This only expresses the contradiction 
that profit UPON ALIENATION 17 implies loss on one side, and therefore 
cannot be a continuous, general relation of production. Pinto says: 
"Trade is a game; and nothing can be won from beggars. If one won 
everything from everybody for a long time, it would be necessary to give back the 
greater part of the profit voluntarily, in order to begin the game again. This 
devouring trade would destroy  itself"  ( Traité de la circulation et du crédit, edit. Pinto, 
Amsterdam, 1771, p. 231). b 
And our friend M'Culloch in fact finds himself unable to 
distinguish in any way at all the principle of speculation, i.e. OF 
GAMBLING,  from that of trade and the movement of capitalism — 
buying in order to sell. He says: 
* "Every transaction in which an individual buys produce in order to sell it 
again, is, in fact, a speculation" * (^4 Dictionary, Practical etc., of Commerce etc., 
London, 1847, [p.] 1056 sqq.). 
Note which is to be made on the division of labour. 
Corbet establishes a very important new principle of the division 
of labour WITHIN THE  SAME  SPHERE  OF PRODUCTION. However, this principle 
of the division of labour cannot be developed here, where we are 
speaking OF ITS GENERAL NATURE, because it already presupposes the 
a A game.— Ed.

242 Capital  and  Profit 
real movement  of capital.153  The  principle  is the  equalisation  of 
the prices of commodities,  WITHIN A LONGER PERIOD OF YEARS, TO THEIR PRICE 
OF PRODUCTION.  In  industry proper  it is  already  the  peculiar 
circulation of fixed capital  WHICH FASTENS  THE  PRODUCER  NOT  ONLY  TO A 
PECULIAR SPHERE  OF PRODUCTION, BUT  TO A  GIVEN SUBDIVISION  OF THAT SPHERE.  In 
trade  (WHOLESALE)  the same  SUBSUMPTION  TO A SPECIAL KIND OF TRADE, AND  TO 
A PARTICULAR SUBDIVISION  OF  THAT KIND,  is  PRODUCED  by the cycle of 
equalisation  of commodity prices [XVIII-1077],  i.e. market prices, 
which  stretches  out  over  a number  of years.  In general Corbet 
emphasises very well how the  AVERAGE PRICE,  which appears  AT  FIRST 
VIEW  as an abstraction, 
1) appears  as a  principle regulating  the  division  of labour; 
2) how in turn particular  TRADES—SPHERES OF EMPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL— 
are formed, which  are  only founded  on  AVERAGES.15* 
* "The third principle  of trade  is, to  deal always  in the  same commodity,  or set of 
commodities"  (p. 12).*  "This  is in  part founded  on and  * aided  by the  necessity  of 
equalising  the  fluctuation  of trade" (I.e.). "Hence when trade  has  made  its greatest 
advances,  and  comes  the  next  to perfection, such divisions  of the professions,  as the 
Russian merchant,  the  American,  the  Dutch merchant,  the  timber merchant,  the 
fruit merchant,  etc." ([p.] 14). 
"Profit,  on the  general principle,  is always  the  same, whatever  be [the]  price; 
keeping  its place like  an incumbent body  on the  swelling  or sinking tide.  As, 
therefore, prices rise,  a tradesman raises prices;  as prices fall,  a tradesman lowers 
price,  i.e. as  they  are  raised  or lowered  to him, he  raises  or lowers them  to his 
customers"* (I.e.,  [p.] 20). 
In this superficial  and  upside down form  it appears  to the 
TRADESMAN THAT PROFIT DOES NOT RESULT FROM A SURCHARGE OF PRICE, BUT THAT  IT 
FORMS PART AND PARCEL  OF THE  VALUE  OF THE  COMMODITY.  It appears to him 
rather in the inverted form that  "PROFIT"  is always  A SURCHARGE OVER 
AND ABOVE  THE  REAL VALUE  OR PRICE  OF THE  PRODUCE. 
The equalisation  of profits (along with  the  AVERAGE  story  we  have 
just noted)  is well presented  in the  following: 
* "Every necessary trade must  or does yield profit,  and  when trade ceases  to do 
so it ceases  to be  necessary" (I.e.,  [p.] 22). "One  business  not  more profitable than 
another" (I.e.).  "One  business  not  more hazardous than another"*  ([p.] 24). "E.g. 
shipping: With regard  to the  trade  in general, * the freight must compensate  or 
pay for all  hazards,  and so far as the  individual  is concerned, they  are  covered  or 
reduced  to nothing  by insurance;  a device  by which  the  loss is spread over all," * 
//it would  be just  as foolish  to say  *that this loss ceases  to exist, 
because  it is  spread over  all, as it  would  be to say  that  the 
diminution  of profits resulting from  the  diminishing proportion  of 
variable  to constant capital,  or from  the  longer revolutions  of fixed 
capital  or the  later returns  of some sorts  of circulating capital,  or 
of any of the  circumstances, regulating  the  equalisation  of profits 
between  different spheres  of production—and  the  hazard,  the  risk 

=====第253页=====
Mercantile Capital [Continued] 243 
of loss, greater  or smaller  in different spheres, fully enters into 
those regulating circumstances—does take away  the  diminution  of 
the general profit  of capital caused  by  those circumstances//, 
"or the  whole trade  is made  to contribute  to the  loss of each individual member, with  a 
fair remuneration  for  those  who  take  the  charge  and  run the  risk of equalising  the 
business,  i.e. the  underwriters"  * (I.e.).  "It can be  assumed  THAT ALL THE SHIPS 
BELONGING  TO  GREAT BRITAIN  are lost (by force or through  DECAY)  in 17 years" 
([p.] 26).  "INSURANCE  against loss  by fire would seem  a very hazardous  TRADE,  if 
one compares the  SMALLNESS  of the  PREMIUM RECEIVED  with the  GREAT SUMS  the 
INSURERS  are called upon to pay.... But owing to  THE  GREAT  EXTENT  OF THE  BUSINESS 
and to the  AVERAGE  which that  * extent establishes,  it is  reduced  to a  business  of 
very equal tenor, yielding always  a fair profit  or percentage  on  capital,  and no 
more; wonderfully exact  and  uniform indeed considering  the  extremes  to which  it 
is subjected"  * ([p.] 27).  "When  we say  that one  business  is not  more profitable 
than another, *this  is to be  understood  of business  in general;  and  taken along 
with the  fact that each individual business  is at  one  time more  or less profitable,  or 
pays better  or worse than  at another. That, indeed,  a variation  of profit  as well as of 
price,  to a  certain extent, perpetually takes place  or is in  constant operation  in each 
and all businesses,  is beyond question.*  It arises  out of * adjusting  the  supply  to the 
demand"  ([p.] 33).  "Fluctuations compensate each other"  ([p.] 35).  "Fluctuations, ebbs 
and flows,  or oscillations continually happen  or are  constantly taking place,  to a 
greater  or [XVIII-1078] less extent,  in each  and all  businesses"*  ([p.] 36). 
With regard  to competition: 
"FOR COMPETITION  the following general principles apply: THE  MINIMUM  OF PRICE 
OF ANY  COMMODITY REGULATES THE MARKET PRICE OF THAT COMMODITY. Secondly:  IT 
IS NOT THE  MAJORITY,  BUT THE  MINORITY  OF  PERSONS,  who regulate competition. 
Thirdly:  * it is  capitalists,  i.e. the  greater  or chief capitalists,  who  fix price.  In this 
manner there  is only  one  company  in England  for  the manufacture  of plate glass 
of any  size,  viz.  the  British Plate Glass Company  at Ravenhead  in Lancashire,  all 
others having been found unable  to compete with  it; and the  great thread 
manufacturers  at  Shrewsbury, oblige  all  other thread manufacturers  in the 
kingdom  to do as  they  do, as all the  Ironfounders  in Scotland  are  regulated  by and 
follow steadily  in the  rear  of the  great Carron company*" (I.e.,  pp.  42-44). 
"LETTING  e.g. of  LANDS  AND  HOUSES  is A  CONDITIONAL SALE,  OR  SALE  OF THE USE  OF A 
THING FOR  A LIMITED TIME' (I.e.,  p. 81). 
Businesses  ON AVERAGE.-
* "The  great principle  on  which  all  insurance proceeds, whether  sea,  life, or 
fire, is average,  the  spreading  of the general loss over  the  whole insured;  or the 
uncertainty  of individual events,  and the  certainty  of general  or cumulative.*  E.g. 
* the duration  of the  life of any one  person  is very uncertain,  but the  average 
duration  or term  of human life  is very certain  or well established.  So also in sea or 
fire insurance,  the  destruction  of any  individual  or particular property  is a matter  of 
uncertainty,  but the  average amount  or value  of the  property destroyed,  or that 
will be destroyed, within  a given time,  is a  thing pretty well ascertained  or settled. 
It follows, therefore, that  the  less the risks  (i.e.  each individual risk)  in amount,  and 
the greater  the  number  of them undertaken,  the  more nearly  is the  business 
reduced  to a  perfect average,  and the  better conducted" (I.e.,  [pp.]  100-01). 
"Business  is at all  times overdone"  (p.  115  sqq.). "However great  the  appetite  or 
desire  of the  public  for any  thing,  the  food administered,  the  supply furnished,

goes always beyond the demand. Like the Malthusian principle of propagation, the 
talent in society is always in advance, redundant, superabundant * (e.g. in the 
writing of newspapers). ...Nowhere is this more conspicuous than in towns. A town 
is always OVERBUILT, THERE BEING ALWAYS MORE HOUSES THAN ARE WANTED, 
particularly in the OUTSKIRTS OR SUBURBS, where they  * never pay, but seem as if 
built for the public good or the dignity or honsur of the place—with but a far 
distant or prospective view to profit*" ([pp.] 115-17). 
An important circumstance in the circulation and reproduction of 
capital is this: Time passes between the outlay and the RETURN of 
the capital, EVEN IF IT  RETURNS.  This interval, in proportion to its size, 
has a dual impact. Firstly on the use value. Time destroys use value 
absolutely; i.e.  * every thing, in a certain period, deteriorates, and 
is at last corrupted, spoilt and bereft of the qualities which 
constitute its value in use; some articles sooner, some later. Some 
must be sold very quickly, not to deteriorate or to be altogether 
spoiled; some may stand a longer time. All are ruined, more or 
less, if, beyond a certain time, they do not enter into consumption, 
or, what is the same, prolong their existence as vendible 
commodities, instead of being used as values in use. This, then, is 
the first risk a commodity runs, in fact capital runs, by being 
converted from money into the shape of commodities, whether 
destined for individual or industrial consumption. Besides, the 
conservation of [XVIII-1079] commodities, so far as they are values 
in use or articles, requests spending upon them of capital and 
labour, in some instances less, in others more. Into their mercantile 
price, there can only enter the average cost which the conservation 
of a given article, during the interval that it finds itself upon the 
market, necessitates. That average cost, for a given article, is 
determined by the average time it is fixed in this interval between 
production and consumption, or its average stay as a commodity 
upon the market. For different articles this cost of conservation 
is evidently determined, not only by the average time they stay 
upon the market, but also by the average deterioration or cost of 
preventing that deterioration, according to the nature of different 
articles, during the same time. If the average time is given, the cost 
of conservation depends for different articles upon their specific 
qualities as values in use. If the cost, resulting from the different 
nature of the articles, is given, it exclusively depends upon their 
different averages of return, or the different averages during 
which they encumber the market, find themselves upon the 
market in the state of commodities (vendible commodities is only a 
tautology). This then constitutes one item of the costs of circulation. 
But it is evident, that this item, instead of adding to the value of 
the general production, can in no case be anything but a deduction 

=====第255页=====
Mercantile Capital [Continued]  245 
from it. Suppose, that the average time, during which all articles 
stay upon the market, be the same; suppose in the second 
instance, that their deterioration and the costs to counteract it be 
the same; that, therefore, the unavoidable déchet* during the 
identical time of circulation and, moreover, the cost to prevent 
extra- déchet or deterioration, be the same for every sort of 
produce; then it is clear, that this unavoidable déchet on the one 
part, and the cost of limiting it to its minimum, is a deduction 
from the value of exchange of the article (at least its  surplus  value), 
firstly because in a given time so much percentage of the whole 
production is simply lost, and, secondly, because so much faux 
frais de production* are incurred, incurred not in creating 
surplus value, but in the task of realising it. It would never do to 
say that the consumer must pay this. But, from what source is he 
to pay it? His source for paying is his  product,  or the co-property in 
the product of another person. It is then clear, that his produce 
has been diminished, and that his costs of production have been 
augmented. Out of a diminished fund of production and of 
increased costs of production, he is positively unable to compen­
sate another producer for the same loss incurred by that other 
producer. It is, therefore, clear, that as far as this item enters into 
price, it does not change the relation of prices of commodities, so 
far as the ratio of  those costs  of circulation  is identical for them, and 
that, so far as it changes the relation of prices, and even of profits, 
this can only constitute a compensation for the greater loss 
incurred by particular branches of business, which exceptional 
loss,  inherent to the nature of the business, is spread, by the 
equalisation of profits, over the whole sphere of employment of 
capital.* 
[XVIII-1080] The  second  effect of time (disregarding the general 
effect  of the  RETURN, TO ENABLE THE PRODUCER TO ENTER UPON REPRODUCTION) 
within the circulation process  * affects not the value in use (and the 
value in exchange only secondarily, so far as it exists only in the 
value of use), but the value of exchange directly, without any 
regard to the changes the article  itself,  or the value in use 
of a commodity, may incur during its intermediate stay between 
production and consumption, or during its sojourn on the market.

supposition that commodities are selling at a price corresponding 
to their real values. 
But the real value of commodities changes during a certain 
interval of time, and the greater the time, the larger the field, the 
opportunity for such changes of value. We do not take into 
consideration the mercantile capital. Although it has bought the 
article beneath its value, the value of the article may fall before it 
sells it, and in this case the difference between buying and selling 
price may either diminish, altogether vanish, or even the selling 
price may fall beneath the buying price according to an 
intermediate change having taken place in the value of the article. 
But, as said, it is not worth while to consider here the mercantile 
capital in particular. 
The process of circulation of the capital dissolves into two parts, 
epochs or phases—first, the conversion of commodity into money, 
and, secondly, the reconversion of money into commodities, viz. 
those commodities which constitute the ingredients entering into 
the production or formation of the first commodity; productive 
ingredients, as we shall call them for abbreviation's sake. Now we 
shall inquire how far any variation or change in value may affect 
price and profit; any variation taking place in one or the other of 
these two phases. We shall commence with the latter, the 
reconversion of money into the productive ingredience. 
Be the commodity produced cotton twist. The twist has been 
sold, converted into money, the surplus value contained in its 
price has been realised, and it is now about being reconverted into 
its productive ingredients. 
It must be converted into cotton, and matières instrumentales, 
such as coal, soap, tallow, etc. It must, furthermore, be converted 
into labour, by paying anew wages out of the funds realised. The 
value of cotton, like all other raw produce, depends, independent­
ly of the will of man, or the capital expended, on the seasons. The 
same quantity of labour may, according to the favour of the 
season, as far as the old cotton fields are concerned, or to the 
fertility of the soil, as far as new fields for the production of 
cotton have been broken up, yield very different quantities of 
cotton. Consequently, the same quantity of cotton, say a cwt or a lb, 
may represent very different values. Suppose now that the value 
of cotton had risen, either because of bad weather, or because the 
additional demand for cotton was supplied from less fertile soils. 
In this case, to replace that part of his capital, which must replace 
cotton, the spinner has to make a greater outlay of the money 
realised. [XVIII-1081] This enhancement in the value of cotton

may absorb  or  surpass  the  whole profit made  in the  first 
revolution  of his  capital. Then  the  price  of labour  may  rise, 
because  the  value  of necessary.  He  must again  pay [the]  greater 
part of his  return,  to replace that part  of his  capital which resolves 
into wages.  If both these circumstances occur  at the  same time,  it 
is probable that, even  if he  employs  the  whole money return— 
capital  and  profit—he will  be unable //without recurrence  to loan, 
not falling under  our  consideration  now// to  recommence  his 
operations  on the  same scale  of production.  At all  events,  he will 
be unable  to do so  with  the  same amount  of capital originally 
advanced.  His  operation  may be a  losing  one, if we  contemplate 
not one, but  both consecutive revolutions  of his  capital. Suppose 
that, during  the  first turn,  he advanced  £100 and had  returned  to 
him 120.  Suppose that  in the  second turn,  the  outlay  for a  less 
quantity  of constant capital having augmented,  and  ditto  the 
variable capital having risen  in value,  but  diminished  in quantity 
(the quantity  of labour employed),  so that  his  profits were only 
5 p.c. He has won 5 p.c. or 515/2i in the  second revolution.  But he 
has advanced  £120, not  only  the  capital  but the  profit  of the  first 
revolution. Thus  he has  lost £146/2i; because this part  of his  profit 
realised  in the  first turn  has  vanished.  In both cases  he has 
realised surplus value;  but  part  of the  surplus value realised  in the 
first turn  has  been lost  in the  second.  In the  second turn, 
considered  for itself, he has  lost, because  he had £100  capital  and 
20 profit,  and has now 120  capital  and  only  515/2i  profit.  It is 
evident that  his  average profit must  be  determined  by the 
equalisation  of these fluctuations during  the  different turns. Hence 
he must stay  to the  same business,  to get the  average rate  of profit. 
There  may  also take place  a change  of value  in the  ingredients  of 
his fixed capital.  If coal,  or iron, would have risen  in value,  the 
déchet  may be  impossible  to be  replaced  at the  same price,  at which 
it originally entered into  the  process  of production.  The  cost  of its 
replacement  may be  higher than  its original cost value amounted 
to. Besides, apart from this part  of the  fixed capital—the déchet  of 
the last year  to be  replaced—the value  of the  whole machinery, 
instruments,  etc., may  have sunk  by a  fall  in its  cost  of 
reproduction,  or by a  fall in its new  value.  In fact,  if the  déchet 
costs more  to replace,  the  unconsumed part  of the  machinery will 
also rise  in value;  if the  value  of the  whole machinery sinks,  the 
cost of replacing  its déchet will also sink. 
We come  now to* C—M,  *the phasis during which  the  produce 
circulates, waiting  to be  changed into money.  We do not  speak  of 
any fall  or rise  of market price originating from changes  in the

relative forces  of  demand  and  supply. Because  we  suppose 
prices=values.  If in the  preceding example  the  price  of x lbs 
twist=£120 (including cost=£100,  of  which  say £80 for raw 
material,  i.e.  cotton +£20 surplus value),  and if the  value  of cotton 
fell suddenly, from  an  extraordinary harvest,  by 60  p.c., then  the 
cotton worked  up in the  twist floating upon  the  market would sink 
as well  as the  cotton  in its raw  state. Hence  the  price  of the x lbs 
would  be  reduced from  £120 to £88 (the  cotton contained  in it 
sinking from  £80 to 48). The  spinner would have incurred  a 
positive loss  of £12, although  he had  realised  a profit  of £20,  or a 
profit  of  [XVIII-1082]  20  p.c. which,  in fact,  may be a  surplus 
value  of 50  p.c.  and  more.  But it  would  for him be the  same  as if 
he had  bought  x lbs [of]  cotton  for £80 in  order  to sell them  for 
48. If there  was not the  surplus value sold  in his  twist,  his  return 
would  be  only=48 + 20—£68. Consequently  of £20  more than  it is 
now in consequence  of the  surplus value realised.  In fact,  if cotton 
continued  on the  same  low  scale  of price,  the  manufacturer,  in the 
new turn  of reproduction, might  lay out  only  £48 in  cotton,  £20 
for the  other expenses,  and  continue  on the  same scale  of 
production.  And he  might  act  with  the £20  profit  as before.  (In 
regard  to the  capital laid  out, the  rate  of profit would even have 
risen.)  But on a  full  or an  approximate return  of the  former 
cotton prices,  he  would  not  possess sufficient capital  for a 
reproduction  on the old  scale.  If he had  debts  to pay  (interest  for 
instance  for £100  borrowed  or  bills  of exchange  on the  suppliers 
of the old  cotton, coal,  etc.) he  might  be  bankrupt.  And, at all 
events,  the  monetary value  of his  capital would have depreciated, 
although  no  depreciation would have taken place  in the  value  of 
money—£88 would  at all  events represent  a smaller capital than 
would  100 (120  with  the  profit) before.  The  effect would  be, of 
course,  the  reverse,  if the  price  of cotton, etc.,  had  risen instead  of 
having fallen.* 
Such  a CHANGE  OF VALUE  directly depreciates  the  capital (produc­
tive),  IF THE CHANGE HAPPENS DURING THE FIRST phasis  C—M\ IT  CRIPPLES 
REPRODUCTION  AND  DIMINISHES PROFIT,  IF IT  OCCURS DURING  THE  SECOND PHASE  : 
M—C. 
But since  the  capital  is always  in both phases simultaneously— 
(newly invested capital,  OR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, IS, OF COURSE, ONLY AFFECTED 
BY THE CHANGES  OF  VALUE WORKING  ON M C) , A  CHANGE  OF  VALUE will thus 
WORK  IN A  CONTRARY DIRECTION UPON  THE  PART  OF THE  CAPITAL CIRCULATING  AS 
CAPITAL  (in C—M) and  * the part  of the  capital reconverted from 
the form  of  money into that  of the  productive ingredients.  For 
instance,  if the  value  of cotton falls,  the  twists  and  cottons upon 

=====第259页=====
Mercantile Capital [Continued] 249 
the market will be depreciated, but the capital of the spinner, etc., 
reconverted into cotton will yield higher profits than before and 
may enable him to enlarge his scale of production. (It will of 
course damage him, if he possesses great provisions of raw cotton, 
before the change of value took place. This will be depreciated 
like the cotton already worked up in twist, etc., and still more 
immediately.) On the other hand, if the value of cotton rises, the 
price (hence the profit, since the cost remains the same) of the 
circulating twist, etc., in short of all goods into which cotton has 
entered, will rise, and so the capital returned far exceed the 
capital advanced (the same will be the case with productive capital 
already invested in cotton=provisions) while the capital to be 
reconverted into cotton* (M—C) *will yield lower profit and may 
necessitate either a contraction of production (should wages not 
have fallen simultaneously) or the employment of additional 
capital, to yield the same quantity of produce and to absorb the 
same quantity, as before, of surplus labour. It is only with 
overstocked markets (be it that the markets are overstocked with 
yarns,  goods, etc., be it that large accumulations of cotton of the 
former harvest still encumber the warehouses of the merchant or 
fill those of the manufacturer) that a fall in the price of cotton (or 
any other productive ingredient) can harm the productive 
capitalist to any degree. But an enhancement in the value of 
cotton, etc., will always check reproduction to a high degree, while 
only with markets overstocked can it bring him any profit.* 
AT ALL EVENTS, these RISKS, arising out of the  * change of value in 
the productive ingredients of commodities, and, therefore, affect­
ing commodities in the interval between production and sale, or 
between their monetary form and their reconversion into the 
productive elements,* can never enter into the costs of circulation 
[XVIII-1083],  THAT IS TO SAY, SUCH COSTS OF CIRCULATION AS ARE COMPENSATED 
FOR IN THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCE. It is clear so far that the  AVERAGE  RISKS 
FROM SUCH CHANGES OF VALUE as are common to all spheres of 
production CAN GIVE NO TITLE OF COMPENSATION FOR ANY PECULIAR SPHERE OF 
PRODUCTION. SECONDLY, the commodities which  ARE  EXCEPTIONALLY  EXPOSED 
TO SUCH SUDDEN FLUCTUATIONS OF VALUE (e.g. all those into which the 
annual produce of the earth enters, as opposed to those into 
which a specific mining product enters) *if they incur the risk of 
extraordinary losses, run the chance of extraordinary gains. And 
thus this becomes equalised.* 
The contemporary COTTON crisis resulting from the American 
Civil War155 has demonstrated both of these things. On the one 
hand, the greatest misery in the MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS and a

standstill  OF THE  MILLS  ON THE  LARGEST SCALE.  On the other hand, since 
the markets have since  1860  been oversupplied,  an increase  in the 
prices of the  YARNS  and  GOODS  available on the market, and therefore 
a rise  in profits  for the  manufacturers  to whom these  GOODS  belong. 
But particularly for those who possessed a  STOCK OF COTTON,  and are 
speculating  with  it in  Liverpool. 
Now  back  to Corbet. 
* "Time produces  a difference  of price.  Now the  principles  of trade suppose  a 
constant selling with  one  hand  as a  buying takes place with  the  other,  so as  that  a 
person shall never have any stock  on hand  on which time  can  operate or produce  an effect * 
This  is never literally  the  case, even with  a GROCER,  much less with  a CLOTHIER.  THE 
EFFECT  OF A RISE  OR FALL  OF PRICE HERE APPLIES especially  TO  THE  MANUFACTURER, 
with whom,  in many cases,  a considerable time often elapses between  the  time 
when  he buys  the raw  material  and  that  at which  he is  * able  to bring  it to  market 
worked  up and  finished  ... while  all must  be affected  to the  extent  of their stock  on 
hand when they come  out of  business, according  to the  difference  of price  at that 
period  as compared with what  it was  when they went  in" ([p.] 121).  "With regard 
to the  profit  of the  shopkeeper,  or the  value  of the  labour laid  out on a raw 
material  by a  manufacturer,  if in  either case  a person  can  replace  his  stock  at a 
price  by as  much less  as the  amount  of that profit  or the  value  of such labour,  he is 
secure  and  safe whatever other difference  may  exist between  the  price  of the 
commodity when purchased  and  when sold. *  E.g.  * shall  he produce  £100  worth  of 
goods,  if he  sell them  for £85 and  replace  his  stock  or raw  material  at £80, or  sell 
them only  for £80 and  replace  his  stock  or raw  materials  at £75,  in either case  he 
comes  out of the  transaction with  a clear gain, profit  or return  on capital  or stock 
of 5%; and he can  never  be placed  in any  better situation  by an  advance  of price, 
because  if in  that case  he has  much  to receive,  he has as  much  to pay  when  he 
returns  to the  market.  It will thus  be seen that  the  profit  on stock  has  nothing  to do 
with, and is  altogether distinct from  the  rise or fall of price"*  ([p.] 121). 
But in any  case  his  capital  is depreciated. Incidentally,  it is  only 
correct  to say  that  he then always makes  a profit  of £5, but it is 
wrong  to say  that  he always makes  a profit  of 5%.  5 on  100=5%;  5 
on 80=6'/4%  and 5 on  75 = 62/3%.  If in  consequence  of the 
VARIATION  OF  VALUE  there is a fall in  THE  VALUE  OF CAPITAL,  the rate of 
profit will rise, provided that  the  AMOUNT OF PROFIT  remains  the  same; 
if the  VALUE  OF CAPITAL  rises  in the  given manner,  the  rate  of profit 
will fall, provided that  THE  AMOUNT  OF PROFIT REMAINS  THE  SAME.  This 
point  is purely formal with  the  MERCHANT,  who  always adds  e.g. 5%, 
* whatever  the  price  of the  commodity.  The  same does  not  hold 
true  with  the  producing capitalist.  The  rate  of profit must rise with 
him in the one  case,  and  fall in the  other,  in as  much  as he  sells 
the same surplus labour  as before.  * 
It is clear from  the  above that  it is  necessary  to * distinguish 
between  one  revolution  of  capital,  and the set of  revolutions  or 
repeated  number  of revolutions which  a capital describes  in an 
economic cycle of reproduction. * If we consider  ONE SINGLE REVOLUTION, 
the profit=the  * ratio  of the  surplus  to the  capital advanced.  And 

=====第261页=====
Mercantile Capital [Continued] 251 
if he sells his commodity under cost price, it is a clear loss. Here 
we have in fact only the difference between the buying price (or 
what is the same to the producing capitalist, the cost price) and the 
selling price (or production price): the difference between the 
value of the capital originally advanced, and the value to which the 
capital worked up into the commodity is sold. However, the thing 
is different, if we consider not only one productive [XVIII-1084] 
revolution, but the process of continual reproduction during an 
economic cycle encompassing several years. * Just as important 
here,  * not only for the profit realised, but for the value of the 
original capital to be [re]placed, [is] the concatenation of, or the 
ratio between, the different single revolutions; in one word the 
difference between the original value of the capital at the 
beginning of a turn and its replacing value at the second turn and 
so forth. For instance, if the capital=100, and profit=10 at the 
end of the first turn, and the replacing value at the beginning of 
the second turn=110, profit=0. And the reproduction would be 
commenced under worse circumstances; since only the same mass 
of surplus labour would be absorbed, although the capital 
advanced would have been augmented. The cost price would have 
increased, and the rate of profit decreased. These fluctuations are 
equalised in the whole cycle (even if the capital be depreciated 
finally, it will be made up by profit) which comprises a set of 
turns.  * 
* "The fall of prices, however, acts as a great discouragement to trade; because 
although the capitalist does not in effect, at least considered as a merchant, lose by 
it, he seems to do so, and the noncapitalist is  ruined.  Thus, supposing a person 
without capital to have purchased £100 worth of goods, and to have given his bill 
for that amount, if he is obliged to sell them for £80, or can sell them for no more, 
he is minus £20, and so cannot meet the demands on him, and is obliged to stop. 
As is commonly the case, the first bill of a person in such circumstances will be paid 
by selling below prime cost, and so may the second; but it is obvious that such an 
expedient must soon tell, and bring matters to a crisis. * The  NON-CAPITALIST  is 
always  EXPOSED  to this * fatality, and his situation very much resembles a time 
bargain between gamblers in the stocks; with this distinction that he wants the 
funds necessary to pay his differences when the day of settlement arrives, if the 
same shall be against him" ([p.] 122). 
"Should we admit that the value of manufactured goods is affected by an 
alteration in the value of the raw material, some, particularly woollen goods, vary 
considerably, and consequently a person may gain or lose by having a stock of such 
on hand* ... for the essence of speculation lies after all in the * raw material, 
without seeming to do so, and would be properly carried into effect only in the 
coarser or plainer sorts, standing clear of fashion and the expense of manufacture 
as much as possible" ([p.] 128 sqq). 
"Accumulation of stocks or non-exchange ... overproduction" ([p.] 104). 
"A bushel of grain or a yard of cloth has, properly considered, no progressive 
value; is fixed and unalterable in its nature; and can be affected only by an

alteration in other things, which may be either for or against according to 
circumstances" ([p.] 204). 
"... time bargains in the funds ... this is branded with the name of gambling; 
because the one seems to lose exactly what the other gains... And gambling it certainly is" 
([pp.] 207-08). 
"With regard to the latter" * (the morality of this gambling with  FUNDS) 
* "indeed, we can see nothing in them different from what takes place in all 
speculation, which, so far as it goes upon the difference of price between one time 
and another, futurity and contingency, may equally come under the denomination of 
gambling; and in point of fact, there are bargains for commodities which proceed 
upon the stipulation of delivery at a future period or the payment of a difference 
in lieu of it" * ([p.] 209).

FOUR LECTURES DELIVERED 
AT THE LONDON MECHANICS' INSTITUTION, LONDON, 1827 
* "Easy labour is only transmitted skill " * ([p.] 48). 
"As all the advantages derived from the division of labour * naturally centre in 
and belong to the labourers, if they are deprived of them, * and in the * progress 
of society* those only are enriched *by their improved skill who never 
labour—this must arise from unjust appropriation; from usurpation and plunder 
in the party enriched,* and from  * consenting submission in the party im­
poverished"* ([pp.] 108-09). 
[XVIII-1085] "The labourers, to be sure, multiply too rapidly when *that 
multiplication is only compared with the want of the capitalist for their services" 
(I.e. [p.] 120). "Malthus points out the effects which an increase in the number of 
labourers has in lessening the share which each one receives of the annual 
produce—the portion of that distributed amongst them being a definite and 
determinate quantity not regulated in any degree by what they annually create" 
(I.e.). 
"Labour, the exclusive standard of value, * but  * labour, the creator of all wealth 
[is] no commodity"* (I.e., [p.] 186). 
Regarding the influence of money on the expansion of wealth, 
Hodgskin remarks correctly: 
* "As a man can dispose of small portions of produce that is corruptible, for 
what is incorruptible, he is under no temptation to throw it away; and thus the use 
of money adds to wealth, by preventing waste" * ([p.] 197). 
The chief advantage of  RETAIL TRADE  derives from the fact that the  QUANTITY  in 
which commodities are best produced is not that in which they are best distributed 
(I.e. [p. 146]). 
* "Both the theory relative to capital, and the practice of stopping labour at that 
point where it can produce, in addition to the subsistence of the labourer, a profit 
for the capitalist, seem opposed to the natural laws which regulate production" * 
([p.] 238). 
With regard to the accumulation of capital, Hodgskin advances 
roughly the same ideas as those contained in his first book.158 
Nevertheless—for the sake of completeness—we will reproduce 
the main passages.

254 Theories  of Surplus Value 
"If one  considers  for example fixed capital,  the  most favourable position  for the 
IDEA  OF  CAPITAL  AIDING  PRODUCTION,  3 CLASSES of circumstances are to be 
distinguished under which  [the  results  of]  accumulation  of  capital  are  very 
DIFFERENT.  1)  When MADE  AND  USED  BY THE  SAME  PERSONS.  It is  obvious that EVERY 
ACCUMULATION  IN HIS POSSESSION  OF THE INSTRUMENTS  HE MAKES AND USES, FACILI­
TATES HIS  LABOUR.  The  limit to such  an ACCUMULATION  is  the POWER  of the LABOURER 
TO MAKE AND USE THE  INSTRUMENTS  IN QUESTION.  2)  WHEN MADE  AND  USED  BY 
DIFFERENT PERSONS, WHO SHARE BETWEEN THEM IN JUST PROPORTION THE PRODUCE OF 
THEIR  COMBINED LABOUR.  Capital  may be  made  by one  labourer  and  used  by 
another; *they divide  the  commodity  in proportion  as each  has  contributed  by his 
labour  to produce  it...  I should rather express this fact, however,  by saying that  a 
part of the society employed  in making instruments, while another part uses them, 
is a branch  of division  of labour which aids productive power  and  adds  to the general 
wealth.  As  long as the  produce  of the two  classes  of labourers  is divided between 
them,  the  accumulation  and  increase  of such instruments  as they  can  make  and 
use, is as  beneficial  as if  they were made  and  used  by one  person" * ([Labour 
Defended..., London,  1825, pp.]  243-44).  "3)  When *owned  by a  class  of persons 
who neither make  nor use it" [p.  243].  "The  capitalist being  the  mere owner  of the 
instruments,  is not, as  such,  a labourer.  He in no  manner assists production"  * 
[pp. 244-45]. 
// In other words, production  * is assisted  by the  instrument,  but 
not by the  title  A holds  to the  instrument;  not by  the  circumstance 
that the  instrument  is  owned  by a  non-labourer.*// 
* "He acquires possession  of the produce  of one labourer, which  he makes over 
to another, either  for a  time *  as is  the case with * most kinds  of fixed capital,  or for 
ever,  as is  the case with wages, whenever  he thinks  it can be  used  or consumed  for 
his advantage.  He  never does allow  the  produce  of one  labourer, when  it comes 
into his  possession,  to be  either used  or consumed  by  another, unless  it is for  his 
benefit.  He  employs  or lends  his property to share the  produce,  or natural revenue,  of 
labourers;  and  every accumulation  of such property  in his hands  is a  mere extension  of 
his power over the produce  of labour,  and  retards  the  progress  of national wealth. This 
[is] at present  the  case... When  the  capitalist, being  the  owner  of all  the produce, 
will allow labourers neither  to make  nor use  instruments, unless  he obtains  a profit 
over and  above  the  subsistence  of the labourer,  it is  plain that bounds  are set to 
productive labour much within what nature prescribes.  In proportion as capital  in the 
hands  of a  third party  is accumulated,  so the whole amount  of profits required  by the 
capitalist increases,  and so  there arises  an  artificial check  to  production  and 
population...  In the  present state  of society,  the  labourers being  in no  case the 
owners  of capital, every accumulation  of it  adds  to the  amounts  of profit demanded from 
them,  and  extinguishes  all  that labour which would only procure  the  labourer  his 
comfortable subsistence.  ... when  it is admitted that labour produces  all things, even 
capital,  it is  nonsense  to attribute productive power  to the instruments labour makes  and 
uses. ...wages facilitate  not  production, like instruments. Labour,  not  capital, pays  all 
wages...* [XVIII-1086]  The  greater part  of the  ADVANCES  of  CAPITALISTS  consists  of

he pays wages; those wages  his  labourers exchange  for the  produce  of other 
labourers,  who  will not  keep  the  wages, whether money  or paper,  and  it is returned 
to the  manufacturer,  who  gives  in exchange  for it the  cloth which  his own 
labourers have made. With  it he  again pays wages,  and the  money  or paper again 
goes the  same round...  *

by no means  SOMETHING SAVED.  AS long  as the  capitalist,  to realise  his  WEALTH,  or 
command over OTHER  PEOPLES LABOUR,  was  obliged  to have  in his  possession AN 
ACTUAL ACCUMULATION  OF the  PRECIOUS METALS  OR  COMMODITIES,  We  might have 
SUPPOSED that ACCUMULATION  OF  CAPITAL  was the  result  OF AN  ACTUAL SAVING,  and 
that on it  depended  the  progress  of society.  But  when paper money  and  parchment 
SECURITIES  were invented, when  the  possessor  of nothing  but  SUCH  A PIECE  OF 
PARCHMENT RECEIVED  AN  ANNUAL REVENUE  IN PIECES  OF PAPER with which  he  obtained 
whatever  was  necessary  for his own use and  consumption, *and  not  giving away  all 
the pieces  of paper,  was  richer  at the end of the  year than  at the  beginning,  or was 
entitled next year  to receive  a still greater number  of pieces  of paper, obtaining  a 
still greater command over  the  produce  of labour,*  it became evident that capital 
was not any  thing saved;  and  that  the  INDIVIDUAL CAPITALIST  did not  grow rich  by 
AN ACTUAL AND MATERIAL SAVING,  but  BY DOING SOMETHING WHICH ENABLED HIM  ...

m) RAMSAY (GEORGE)  (OF  TRINITY COLLEGE), 
AN ESSAY  ON THE  DISTRIBUTION  OF  WEALTH, EDINBURGH,  1836 
With Ramsay we return again to the political economists. 
In order to find a place for commercial capital, he calls it  "THE 
TRANSPORT  OF COMMODITIES FROM ONE PLACE  TO ANOTHER"  ([p.] 19). He thus 
confuses trade with the  CARRYING INDUSTRY. 
Ramsay's chief contribution: 
First: That he does in fact make the distinction between constant 
and variable capital. True, this occurs in such a manner that the 
distinction between fixed and circulating capital which he takes 
from the circulation process is the only one which he nominally 
retains,  but he defines fixed capital in such a way that it includes 
all the elements of constant capital. He therefore regards as fixed 
capital, not only machinery and instruments, buildings in which 
labour is carried on or in which the result of labour is  STORED,

draught and breeding animals, but also all raw materials (semi­
manufactures, etc.), "THE  SEED  OF THE AGRICULTURIST  AND  THE  RAW  MATERIAL 
OF THE MANUFACTURER" ([p]p. 22-23). Moreover "MANURE OF ALL KINDS, 
FENCES FOR AGRICULTURE AND THE FUEL CONSUMED IN MANUFACTURES" (l.C. [p. 23]) 
are fixed capital. 
*" Circulating capital* consists only *of subsistence* and * other necessaries 
advanced to the workmen, previous to the completion of the produce of their 
labour*" (I.e.). 
It can be seen therefore that by "CIRCULATING CAPITAL" he 
understands nothing but [XVIII-1087] the part of capital that can be 
resolved into wages, and by  FIXED  CAPITAL,  the part that can be resolved 
into the objective conditions—means and materials of labour. The 
mistake here, however, is the identification of this division of capital, 
which is directly derived from the production process, with the 
distinction which arises from the circulation process. This is due to 
his adherence to the tradition of political economy. 
On the other hand, Ramsay again confuses the purely material 
element of the fixed capital thus defined with its existence as 
"capital". Circulating capital (i.e. variable capital) does not enter 
into the real labour process, but what does enter, is living labour, 
which is bought with circulating capital, and which replaces it. 
What enters in addition into the labour process is constant capital, 
that is, labour objectified in the objective conditions of labour, in 
the materials and means of labour. Ramsay therefore writes: 
* "Fixed capital alone, not circulating, is properly speaking a source of national 
wealth" ([p.] 23). "Labour and fixed capital are the only elements of expense of 
production" * ([p.] 28). 
What is really expended in the production of a commodity are 
raw materials, machinery, etc., and the living labour which sets 
them in motion. 
"CIRCULATING" CAPITAL is superfluous, EXTRANEOUS TO THE PROCESS OF 
PRODUCTION.160 
* "Were we to suppose the labourers not to be paid until the completion of the 
product, there would be no occasion whatever for circulating capital.* Production 
would be just as great. This proves that  * circulating capital is not an immediate 
agent of production, not even essential to it at all, but merely a convenience rendered 
necessary by the deplorable poverty of the mass of the people*" ([p.] 24). "The * fixed 
capital alone constitutes an element of cost of production in a national point of 
view" * ([p.] 26). 
In other words: the labour objectified in the conditions of 
labour—materials and means of labour—which we call "fixed 
capital", and the living labour, in short, embodied, objectified

Ramsay 257 
labour and living labour, are necessary conditions of production, 
elements of the national wealth. On the other hand, it is a mere 
"convenience" due to the "deplorable poverty of the mass of the 
people" that the means of subsistence of the workers at all assume 
the form of "CIRCULATING capital". Labour is a condition of 
production, but wage labour is not, and neither, therefore, is it 
necessary that the workers' means of subsistence confront them as 
"capital", as an "advance by the capitalist". What Ramsay 
overlooks is that if the means of subsistence of the workers did not 
confront them as "capital" (as "circulating capital", as he calls it), 
neither would the objective conditions of labour confront them as 
"capital", as "fixed capital", as he calls it. Ramsay attempts in 
earnest, and not merely in words as the other economists do, to 
reduce capital to "A PORTION  OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH, EMPLOYED,  OR MEANT 
TO BE EMPLOYED, IN FAVOURING REPRODUCTION" [p. 21]; he  therefore 
declares wage labour and consequently capital—that is the social 
form which the means of reproduction assume on the basis of 
wage labour—to be unimportant and due merely to the poverty of 
the mass of the people. 
Thus we have arrived at the point where political economy 
itself—on the basis of its analysis—declares the capitalist form of 
production, and consequently capital, to be not an absolute, but 
merely an "accidental", historical condition of production. 
Ramsay, however, does not go far enough to draw the correct 
conclusions from his premisses, from the new definition which he 
has given to capital in the immediate production process. 
Ramsay comes indeed close to the correct definition of surplus 
value. 
* "A circulating capital will always maintain more labour than that formerly 
bestowed upon  itself.  Because, could it employ no more than had been previously 
bestowed upon  itself,  what advantage could arise to the owner from the use of it as 
such?"  * ([p.] 49). Or will people assert that the * quantity of labour which any 
circulating capital will employ is no more than equal to that previously  bestowed  upon 
it? * This would mean that * the value of the capital expended was equal to that of 
the product" * ([p.] 52). 
This means, therefore, that the capitalist exchanges less objec­
tified labour for more living labour and that this surplus of 
unpaid living labour constitutes the excess of the value of the 
product over the value of the capital consumed in its production, 
in other words, the surplus  VALVE  (profit, etc.). If the amount of 
labour for which the capitalist pays wAGES=the amount which he 
receives back from the worker in the product, then the value of 
the product would be no greater than that of the capital and there 
would be no profit. Although Ramsay is very close here to the real

258 Theories of Surplus Value 
origin of surplus value, he is nevertheless too bound up in the 
tradition of the economists not to begin immediately straying again 
along false paths. First of all, the way he explains this exchange 
between variable capital [XVIII-1088] and labour is ambiguous. If 
he had been quite clear about this, then further misunderstanding 
would have been impossible. He says: 
"Circulating capital, for instance,  RAISED BY THE LABOUR OF  100  MEN,  will set in 
motion 150 men.  THEREFORE THE PRODUCT AT THE END OF THE YEAR  will, in this case, 
be the result of the labour of 150 men" ([p.] 50). 
Under what circumstances can the product of 100 men buy [the 
labour of] 150 men? 
If the wages received by a worker for 12 hours' labour=the 
value of 12 hours' labour, then only one working day could be 
bought back with the product of his labour and only 100 [working 
days] with the product of 100 working days. But if the value of 
the daily product of his labour=12 labour hours and the value of 
the daily wage he receives=8 labour hours, then IV2 working days 
or [the labour of] IV2 men can be paid for, bought back, for the 
value of his daily product. And 100 (I +  V2 men or working 
days)= 100+50= 150 men can be employed with the product of 
100 working days. Thus, the condition in which the product of 
100 men sets 150 in motion is that each of the 100 men and, in 
general, every worker, spends half as much time working gratis 
for the capitalist as he works for  himself,  or that he spends /s of 
the working day working gratis. Ramsay does not make this clear. 
The ambiguity appears in the conclusion: "THEREFORE THE  PRODUCT  AT 
THE END OF THE YEAR WILL, IN THIS CASE, BE THE RESULT OF THE LABOUR OF 150 
MEN." It will indeed be the result  OF THE LABOUR  OF 150 men in the 
same way as the product of 100 men was THE  RESULT  OF THE LABOUR  OF 
100 men. The ambiguity (and certainly the lack of clarity, plus ou 
moins* derived from Malthus) is to be found in this: It appears as 
if the profit arises merely from the fact that 150 men are now 
employed instead of 100. Just as if the profit derived from the 150 
workers arose from the fact that 225 workers can now be set in 
motion by the product of the 150 (100:150=150:225) (4:6=6:9). 
But that is not the point. 
The labour which the 100 men supply =x, if x is their total 
working day. The wages they receive [will then equal] 2/3x Hence 
the value of their product=x, the value of their wages  = x —  1/$x, and 
the surplus value made on them='/3X.

in wages, then  150 men can  be employed with  it and  their product 
will be=to  the  wages  of 225  men.  The  labour time  of 100 men is 
the labour time  of 100 men. But  the  labour they  are  paid for is the 
product  of  662/ä men,  that  is,  only  2/ä of the  value embodied  in 
their product.  The  ambiguity [arises] because  it appears  as if the 
100 men or the  100  working days  (it makes  no  difference whether 
they are  days calculated over  a year  or separate days) produce  150 
working days—a product embodying  the  value  of 150  working 
days;  while, conversely,  the  value  of 100  working days suffices  to 
pay for 150  working days.  If the  capitalist continues  to employ  100 
men as he did  previously, then  his  profit remains  the  same.  He 
will continue  to pay the 100 men a  product=the labour time  of. 
662/s men and  pocket  the  rest as he did  before.  If, on the  other 
hand,  he  lays  out the  whole product  of the  100 men  in wages once 
again, then  he  accumulates  and  appropriates  a new  amount  of 
SURPLUS LABOUR  equal  to 50  working days instead  of only  33'/3  as he 
did previously. 
It is immediately apparent that Ramsay  is not  clear  on the  point, 
since  he  once again advances against  the  determination  of value  by 
labour time  the  otherwise "inexplicable" phenomenon that  the 
rates of profit  are  equal  for  capitals which exploit different masses 
of labour.43 
* "The  use of fixed capital modifies  to a  considerable extent  the principle that 
value depends upon quantity  of labour.  For  some commodities  on which  the same 
quantity  of labour  has  been expended, require very different periods before they 
are fit for  consumption.  But  as during this time  the  capital brings  no return,  in 
order  that  the employment  in question should  not be less lucrative  than  others  in which  the 
product  is sooner ready  for use, it is  necessary that  the  commodity, when  at last 
brought  to market, should  be increased  in value  by all the  amount  of [the] profit 
withheld* This shows  how  * capital  may  regulate value independently  of labour" * 
([p.] 43). 
It shows rather that  CAPITAL REGULATES AVERAGE PRICES  161 INDEPENDENTLY 
OF THE  VALUE  OF THE particular  PRODUCT  and  that  it  exchanges 
commodities  not  according  to their value,  but in  such  a way  that 
ONE EMPLOYMENT  OF  CAPITAL  ...  should  not be  less [XVIII-1089] 
PRODUCTIVE THAN OTHERS.  Since empty tradition  is more powerful  in 
political economy than  in any  other science, Ramsay does  not  fail 
either  to  reproduce  the  "wine  in the  cellar"  162 argument which 
has been notorious since  the  time  of [James] Mill.  And  he therefore 
concludes that  "CAPITAL  [is] A  SOURCE  OF  VALUE INDEPENDENT  OF  LABOUR" 
([p.] 55),  whereas  the  most  he  would have been justified  in 
concluding was that  THE SURPLUS VALUE REALISED BY CAPITAL  IN A  PARTICULAR 
EMPLOYMENT DOES  NOT  DEPEND UPON  THE  QUANTITY  OF  LABOUR EMPLOYED  BY  THAT 
PARTICULAR CAPITAL.  [XVIII-1090] This false conception  of Ramsay's  in

260 Theories  of Surplus Value 
this case  is all the  more surprising since,  on the one  hand,  he  grasps 
the natural basis,  so to  speak,  of  SURPLUS VALUE,  and,  on the  other hand, 
he affirms with regard  to one  instance that  the  DISTRIBUTION  of  SURPLUS 
VALUE—its  equalisation  to the  general rate  of  profit—does  not 
increase  the  SURPLUS VALUE  itself. 
"The source  of profit  is the LAW of the  MATERIAL WORLD, whereby  the 
* beneficence  of nature, when aided  and  directed  by the  labour  and  skill of men, gives 
so ample  a return  to national industry  as to  leave  a surplus  of products over and above 
what is absolutely necessary  for  replacing  in kind  the  fixed capital consumed,  and  for 
perpetuating  the  race  of labourers employed.."*  [p. 205]. 
("PERPETUATING  THE  RACE  OF  LABOURERS"  [XVIII-1091]  is a  fine result 
of capitalist production.  Of  course,  if labour only sufficed  to 
reproduce  the  conditions  of labour  and to  keep  the  workers alive, 
no SURPLUS  would be possible,  HENCE  NO  PROFIT  and  NO  CAPITAL.  But that 
nature  has  nothing whatever  to do  with  it and  that  the  RACE  OF 
LABOURERS PERPETUATES  itself despite this  SURPLUS  and  that  the  SURPLUS 
assumes  the  form  of  profit  and on  this  BASIS  the  RACE  OF CAPITALISTS 
"PERPETUATES"  itself,  has  been admitted  by  Ramsay himself since  he 
declares that  "CIRCULATING CAPITAL",  by  which  he  means wages, wage 
labour,  is not an  ESSENTIAL  condition  of  production,  but is due 
merely to the  "DEPLORABLE  POVERTY  OF  THE  MASS  OF THE POPULATION"  [p. 24]. 
He does  not  draw  the  conclusion that  it is  capitalist production 
which  "PERPETUATES"  this  "DEPLORABLE POVERTY",  although  he  admits  it 
when he says that it  "PERPETUATES  THE  PACE  OF  LABOURERS"  AND  LEAVES  THEM 
ONLY  AS MUCH  AS is NECESSARY FOR THAT PERPETUATION.  In the sense indicated 
above  it can be  said that  SURPLUS VALUE,  etc.,  rests  on a  natural  law, 
that  is, on  THE  PRODUCTIVITY  OF  HUMAN LABOUR  in its  exchange with 
nature.  But  Ramsay himself states that  a source  of  SURPLUS VALUE  is 
the absolute lengthening  of  labour time  (p. 102) as  well  as the 
increased productivity  of  labour brought about  by  industry.) 
* "... Let the  gross produce  be ever so little more than  is strictly essential  for the 
above purposes,  and the  separation  of a  distinct revenue from  the  general mass, 
under  the  appellation  of profit,  and  belonging  to another class  of men,  becomes 
possible"  ([p.] 205).  " The very existence  of the master-capitalists  as a  distinct class  is 
dependent  on the productiveness  of industry"*  ([p.] 206). 
Secondly, with regard  to the  equalisation  of the  rate  of profit  as a 
result  of the  rise  in  prices IN  SOME BRANCHES  caused  by  increases  in 
wages, Ramsay observes: 
The rise  in prices  in some branches  of industry resulting from increases  in 
wages  * "by  no  means exempted  the  master-capitalists from suffering  in their 
profits,  nor  even  at all  diminished their total  loss,  but only served  to distribute  it more 
generally3 among  the  different orders composing that body"*  ([p.] 163).

Ramsay 261 
And if the capitalist whose wine is the product of 100 men 
(Ramsay's example) sells it for the same price as a capitalist whose 
commodity is the product of 150 men, in order that "THE 
EMPLOYMENT [of Capital] IN QUESTION BE NO LESS LUCRATIVE THAN OTHERS" 
[p. 43], then it is clear that thereby the SURPLUS VALUE embodied in 
the wine and in the other commodity is not increased, but only 
DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY between DIFFERENT ORDERS OF CAPITALISTS [XVIII-
1091]. 
[XVIII-1089] He also brings up again Ricardo's EXCEPTIONS.163 
These latter will have to be discussed in that part of our text 
where we speak of the conversion of VALUE into  PRICE  OF PRODUCTION.164 
That is, very briefly, as follows. Provided that in the different 
TRADES the length of the working day (in so far as this is not 
compensated by the INTENSITY OF LABOUR, the unpleasantness of the 
work, etc.) is the same, or rather the  SURPLUS  LABOUR is the same [as 
well as] the rate of exploitation, the rate of surplus value can 
change only if wages rise or fall. Such variations in the rate of 
surplus value=the rise or fall in wages, will affect the production 
prices of commodities in different ways according to the organic 
composition of capital. Capital in which the variable part is large 
compared to the constant part, would acquire more surplus labour 
as a result of a fall in wages and would appropriate less surplus 
labour as a result of a rise in wages than capital with a larger 
proportion of the constant part to the variable part. A rise or fall 
in wages would therefore have opposite effects on the rate of 
profit in the two branches or on THE  GENERAL  RATE  OF PROFIT. In order 
to maintain the general rate of profit, if wages rise, the prices of 
the first kind of commodities will rise, and those of the second 
kind will fall. (Either type of capital will of course be directly 
affected by variations in wages only in proportion to the greater or 
less quantity of living labour it employs in comparison with the 
total capital expended.) Conversely, if wages fall, the prices of the 
first kind of commodities will fall and those of the second kind will 
rise. 
Strictly speaking, all this hardly belongs to the discussion of the 
original conversion of VALUES into production prices and the 
original establishment of the general rate of profit, since it is much 
more a question of how a general rise or fall in wages will affect 
production prices regulated by the general rate of profit. 
Still less has this problem ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DIFFERENCE 
between  FIXED  AND  CIRCULATING  CAPITAL.  Bankers and merchants employ 
almost exclusively circulating capital and hardly any variable 
capital; that is, they lay out relatively small amounts of capital on 
18-613

262 Theories  of Surplus Value 
living labour. Contrariwise, a mine-owner employs incomparably 
more fixed capital than a capitalist engaged in tailoring. But it is 
very questionable whether he employs relatively as much living 
labour. It is merely because Ricardo advanced this special, 
relatively insignificant case as the only instance of a divergence 
between production price and  VALUE  (or, as he incorrectly put it, as 
an exception to the determination of  VALUE  by labour time) and 
presented it in the form of a difference between fixed and 
circulating capital, that this  BLUNDER—and  in an incorrect form at 
that—has survived as an important dogma in all subsequent 
political economy. (The mine-owner should be counterposed not 
to the tailor but to the banker and the merchant.) 
* "The rise of wages is limited by the productiveness of industry. In other 
words,  ... a man can never receive more for the labour of a day or year than with 
the aid of all the other sources of wealth, he can produce in the same  time...  His 
pay must be less than  this,  for a portion of the gross produce always goes to 
replace  fixed capital" * (i.e. constant capital, raw materials and machinery, etc., 
according  to Ramsay) * "with its profit"* ([p.] 119). 
Here Ramsay confuses two things. The amount of "fixed 
capital" embodied in the daily product is not the product of the 
day's labour of the worker; in other words, this portion of the 
value of the product represented by a portion of the product in 
natura is not the product of this day's labour. On the other hand, 
profit is indeed a deduction from the daily product of the worker 
or from the value of this daily product. 
Although Ramsay has not clearly elaborated the nature of 
surplus value and although in particular he remains firmly rooted 
in the old prejudices with regard to the relation of VALUE and 
production price and the conversion of surplus value into AVERAGE 
PROFIT,  he has on the other hand drawn another, correct 
[XVIII-1090] conclusion from his conception of fixed and 
circulating capital. 
Before coming to this [here is another passage about "value"]: 
* " Value must be in proportion not merely to the capital truly consumed, but to 
that also which continues unaltered, viz. to the total capital employed" * ([p.] 74). 
By this he means that profit, and therefore also the production 
price, must be in proportion [to the total capital employed] 
whereas the VALUE obviously cannot be altered by that part of the 
capital which does not enter into the value of the product. With 
the advance of society (i.e. of capitalist production) the fixed 
portion of capital increases at the expense of the circulating 
capital, i. e. that laid out in labour.43 Therefore the demand for 
labour declines relatively as wealth increases or capital is accumu-

lated.  In manufacture,  the  "evils" which  the  development  of the 
productive power generate  for the  workers  are  temporary,  but 
reappear constantly.  In agriculture, they  are  continuous, especially 
in connection with  the  conversion  of arable land into pasture.  The 
general result  is:  With  the  advance  of  society,  i.e.  with  the 
development  of  capital, here with that  of national wealth,  the 
condition  of the  workers  is affected less  and  less by  this 
development, alias,  it worsens relatively  in the  same ratio  as the 
general wealth increases,  i.e. as  capital  is accumulated,  or,  what 
amounts  to the same thing,  as the scale  of reproduction increases. 
One can see  that it is a far  cry from this conclusion  to the  naive 
conceptions  of Adam Smith  or the  apologetics  of vulgar political 
economy.  For  Adam Smith,  the  accumulation  of capital  is identical 
with growing demand  for  labour, CONTINUAL RISE  OF WAGES,  and 
consequently with  a FALL  OF PROFITS.  In his  time,  the  demand  for 
labour  did in  fact grow  at least  in the  same proportion  in which 
capital  was  accumulated, because manufacture still predominated 
at that time  and  large-scale industry  was  only  in its  infancy. 
"The  DEMAND  FOR  LABOUR  depends only"  (DIRECTLY, IMMEDIATELY)  "upon  the 
AMOUNT  OF  CIRCULATING CAPITAL"  ([pp.] 86-87). (This  is tautology  on  Ramsay's 
part, since  he equates  CIRCULATING CAPITAL  with capital laid  out in  wages.) "With 
the progress of civilisation  THE  FIXED CAPITAL  OF THE  COUNTRY  IS INCREASED  AT THE 
EXPENSE  OF  THE  CIRCULATING"  ([pp.] 88-89).  "The  DEMAND  FOR  LABOUR  will  not 
therefore  GENERALLY  increase  as  CAPITAL AUGMENTS,  at least  not  IN  THE  SAME 
PROPORTION"  ([p.] 88). "It is not, until, favoured by the  NEW INVENTIONS, CIRCULAT­
ING CAPITAL SHALL HAVE BECOME INCREASED  beyond what it formerly was," 
//here again  the  wrong assumption creeps  in that an  INCREASE  of 
necessaries  in general  and  INCREASE  of that portion  of necessaries 
intended  for the  workers  are the  same thing// 
* "that  a greater demand  for  labour will spring  up.  Demand will then rise,  but 
not in proportion  to the  accumulation  of the  general capital.  In countries where 
industry  has  much advanced, fixed capital comes gradually  to bear  a greater  and 
greater proportion  to circulating. Every augmentation, therefore,  in the national stock 
destined  for reproduction, comes,  in the progress  of society,  to have a less and  less influence 
upon the  condition  of the labourer" ([pp.] 90-91). "Every addition  to fixed capital  is 
made  at the  expense  of the  circulating",*  i.e. at the  expense  of the  demand  for 
labour  ([p.] 91).  *"The evils resulting from  the  invention  of machinery,  to the 
labouring population employed  in manufactures, will probably  be but  temporary, 
liable  to be perpetually renewed however,  as fresh improvements  are  constantly making 
for economising labour"*  [p. 91]. 
And for the  following reasons. [Firstly:]  The  CAPITALISTS  who USE 
THE NEW  MACHINERY  obtain EXTRAORDINARY PROFITS; consequently their 
capacity  to save  and to  increase their capital grows.  A portion  of 
this is also used  as  CIRCULATING CAPITAL. Secondly:  The  price  of the 
manufactured commodities falls  in proportion  to the  DIMINISHED  COST

OF PRODUCTION;  thus the  CONSUMERS  save, and this facilitates the 
ACCUMULATION  OF CAPITAL,  a portion of which may find  ITS  WAY  TO THE 
MANUFACTURING  INDUSTRY  IN QUESTION.  Thirdly: The fall in the price of 
these products increases the demand for them ([pp.] 92-93). 
"Thus though  the  machinery  MAY  THROW  OUT OF  EMPLOYMENT  A CONSIDERABLE 
BODY  OF  PERSONS,  this will  yet  probably  be followed,  AFTER  A LONGER  OR  SHORTER 
PERIOD,  by THE  RE-ENGAGEMENT  OF THE  SAME,  OR  EVEN  A GREATER NUMBER  OF 
LABOURERS" ([pp.] 92-93).  "In  agriculture  the  case  is widely different.  The  DEMAND 
FOR RAW  PRODUCE  cannot increase  in  that rapid  way in  which  it may for 
MANUFACTURED GOODS...  The  most fatal  to the  COUNTRY PEOPLE  is *the conversion 
of arable land into pasture... Almost  all the  funds which formerly supported  men, 
are now  vested  in cattle, sheep,  and  other elements  of fixed capital*"  ([p.] 93). 
[XVIII-1091] Ramsay remarks correctly: 
"* Wages  as well  as profits  are to be  considered each  of them  as really  a portion 
of the  finished product, totally distinct  in a  national point  of view from  the  cost  of 
raising  it" ([p.] 142).  "Fixed capital  ... independent  of its  results  ... is a  pure loss...* 
But, besides this, LABOUR,  not  WAGES,  not  WHAT  IS PAID FOR  IT, is an  element  of cost 
of production. LABOUR  is a  SACRIFICE.  *The more  of it is  expended  in one 
employment,  the  less  for  another,  and,  therefore, when applied  to unprofitable 
undertakings,  the  nation suffers from  the  waste  of the  principal source  of wealth...* 
The REWARD  OF LABOUR  does  not  constitute  an element OF COST" ([pp.] 141-43). 
(This is quite right: labour, and not paid labour or wages, must 
be considered as an element of value.) 
Ramsay describes the real reproduction process correctly: 
"In what manner  is a  comparison  to be  instituted between  the  product  and the 
* stock expended upon  it?...  With regard  to a  whole nation  ... it is  evident that  all 
the various elements  of the stock expended must  be reproduced  in some employment  or 
another, otherwise  the  industry  of the  country could  not go on as  formerly.  The 
raw material  of manufactures,  the  implements used  in them,  as also  in agriculture, 
the extensive machinery engaged  in the  former,  the  buildings necessary  for 
fabricating  or storing  the  produce, must  all be  parts  of the  total return  of a 
country,  as well  as of the  advances  of all its  master-capitalists. Therefore,  the 
quantity  of the  former  may be  compared with that  of the  latter, each article being 
supposed placed  as it  were beside that  of a  similiar kind*" ([pp.] 137-39). 
"Now  as regards  the  individual capitalist 
//this is a false abstraction. The nation does not exist, or exists 
only as the capitalist class, and the whole class operates in exactly 
the same way as the individual capitalist. The two methods of 
approach differ from one another only in that one clings to and 
isolates use value, the other exchange value//, 
"since  he does  not  replace  his outgoings  IN  KIND,  by far  THE GREATER NUMBER 
must  be  obtained  by  EXCHANGE,  A  CERTAIN PORTION  OF THE  PRODUCT BEING 
NECESSARY  FOR THIS PURPOSE. Hence each  * individual master-capitalist comes  to look 
much more  to the  exchangeable value  of his  product than  to its  quantity" 
([pp.] 145-46). 
[XVIII-1092]  "The  more  the  value  of his  product exceeds  the value  of the  capital 
advanced, the greater will be  his profit. Thus, then, will  he estimate  it, by  comparing

Ramsay 265 
value with value,  not  quantity with quantity.* This  is the  first difference  TO  BE 
REMARKED  IN THE  MODE  OF  RECKONING PROFITS BETWEEN NATIONS  AND  INDIVIDUALS." 
//The nation  too—SUPPOSING  IT TO BE  SOMETHING ELSE THAN  THE SUM  OF 
CAPITALISTS—can  so  FAR compare value with value:  it can  calculate 
the total labour time which  it has to  expend  * to  replace  the 
used-up part  of its  constant capital  and the  part  of the  product 
consumed individually,  and the  time  of labour spent  in producing 
a surplus destined  to enlarge  the  scale  of reproduction.*// 
"The second  is, that, since  the  MASTER-CAPITALIST  always makes  an ADVANCE OF 
WAGES  to the  LABOURERS, INSTEAD  OF  PAYING THEM  OUT OF THE  FINISHED COMMODITY, 
HE CONSIDERS THIS  AS  WELL  AS THE  FIXED CAPITAL CONSUMED,  A PART  OF  HIS  EXPENSES, 
THOUGH THEY, NATIONALLY SPEAKING,  are not AN  ELEMENT  OF  COST." 
//This difference  too  disappears  in  fact  in the  process  of 
reproduction  as a  whole. *The capitalist always pays  out of the 
finished commodity, that  is to say, out of the  commodity finished  by 
the labourer yesterday  he  pays  his  wages tomorrow,  or in  point  of 
fact, he  gives  him, in the  form  of wages, only  an  assignation  of 
products  to be  finished  in  future  or  almost produced  (i.e.  finally 
produced)  by the  time they  are  bought.*  The  ADVANCE  disappears 
as a mere illusion  in  reproduction,  i.e. in the  CONTINUITY  OF THE 
PROCESS  OF PRODUCTION.// 
"Hence  his  RATE OF PROFIT will depend *upon  the  excess  in the  value  of his 
product over  and  above  the  value  of the  capital, both fixed  and  circulating*" 
([p.] 146). 
//This is likewise true IN A  "NATIONAL POINT  OF VIEW".  His profit 
always depends  on  what  he  himself pays  for the  product,  WHETHER 
FINISHED  OR NOT,  WHEN  HE PAYS WAGES.// 
Ramsay  has the  merit, firstly, that  he  CONTRADICTS  the  false 
NOTION—CURRENT  since Adam  Smith—OF  THE VALUE OF THE  WHOLE  PRODUCE 
DISSOLVING  INTO REVENUE UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES;  secondly, that he deter­
mines  the  rate  of profit  in two  ways, [once]  by the  RATE  of wages, 
i.e. the  rate  of surplus value,  and a  second time,  by the  value  of 
the constant capital.  But he  transgresses  in the  opposite direction 
to Ricardo. Ricardo arbitrarily seeks  to equalise  the  rate  of profit 
and the  rate  of surplus value.  On the  other hand,  the  twofold 
determination  of the  rate  of profit—1)  by the  rate  of surplus 
value  (HENCE  by THE  RATE OF  WAGES)  and 2) by the ratio of this surplus 
value  to the  total capital advanced, that  is,  IN FACT  determined  by 
the ratio  of the  constant capital  to the  total capital—is irrationally 
presented  by  Ramsay  as two  parallel circumstances which deter­
mine  the  rate  of profit.  He  does  not  grasp  the  transformation 
which surplus value undergoes before  it becomes profit. Whereas 
therefore Ricardo arbitrarily seeks  to reduce  the  rate  of profit  to 

=====第276页=====
266 Theories  of Surplus Value 
the rate  of surplus value  in order  to work,  out the  theory  of value 
consistently, Ramsay seeks  to reduce surplus value  to profit.  We 
shall see  later that  the way  he describes  the  influence  of the  VALUE 
of constant capital  on the  rate of profit  is very inadequate,  and 
even incorrect. 
* "Profit must rise  or fall exactly  as the  proportion  of the gross produce,  or of its 
value, required  to replace necessary advances, falls  or rises...*  The  rate  OF PROFIT, 
therefore, depends *upon  two  circumstances:  1) the proportion  of the  whole 
produce which goes  to the  labourers; secondly,  the  proportion which must  be set 
apart  for  replacing, either  in kind  or by exchange,  the fixed capital"* ([pp.] 147-48). 
In other words, therefore,  [the  rate of profit depends]  on the 
excess  of the  VALUE  of the product over  THE SUM OF  CIRCULATING  AND  FIXED 
CAPITAL; HENCE  on the proportion WHICH, FIRSTLY, THE CIRCULATING CAPITAL, 
AND,  SECONDLY,  THE  FIXED  CAPITAL,  BEAR  TO THE  VALUE  OF THE  WHOLE  PRODUCE.  If 
we know where this  SURPLUS  comes from, then  the  whole matter  is 
very simple.  But  if we only know that  the  profit depends  on the 
ratio of the  SURPLUS  to these outlays, then  we can  acquire  the  most 
inaccurate NOTIONS about  the  ORIGIN  of this surplus,  for example  we 
can, like Ramsay, imagine that  it originates  in part  in fixed 
(constant) capital. 
[XVIII-1093]  "It is  certain *that  an  increased facility  of raising  the  various 
objects which enter into  the  composition  of fixed capital, tends,  by diminishing this 
proportion,  to raise  the  rate  of profit, just  as in  the former case  of an  augmented 
return  of the  elements  of circulating capital, which serves  to maintain labour"  * 
([p.] 164). 
With regard  to the  tenant farmer,  for  example: 
* "... be the  [amount  of gross] return small  or great,  the quantity  of it  required  for 
replacing what  has  been consumed  in these different forms,  can  undergo  no 
alteration whatsoever. This quantity must  be  considered  as  constant,  so long as 
production  is carried  on on  the same scale. Consequently,  the  larger  the total return,  the 
less must  be the proportion  of the whole which  the  farmer must  set aside  for the 
above purposes"* (I.e.,  [p.] 166). 
"The more easily  the  FARMER  who  produces FOOD  and  RAW  MATERIALS  such  as 
FLAX,  HEMP, WOOD,  etc., can  reproduce them,  [the  more]  his profit will increase.  The 
FARMER'S  PROFIT  [increases] as a result of the  INCREASE  IN  THE  QUANTITY  OF HIS 
PRODUCE,  the  TOTAL VALUE  of  which REMAINS  THE  SAME,  but  A SMALLER PROPORTION  OF 
THIS  SUM  TOTAL,  and  CONSEQUENTLY  OF ITS  VALUE,  is required  FOR  RESTORING  THE 
VARIOUS  ELEMENTS  OF  FIXED  CAPITAL,  WITH WHICH  THE  FARMER  CAN  SUPPLY HIMSELF; 
WHILE  THE  MANUFACTURER WOULD BENEFIT  because  His  product would have  a 
GREATER  PURCHASING POWER"([pp.]  166-67). 
Let us  assume that  the  harvest=100  qrs and the  seed 
corn = 20  qrs,  that is, '/s of the  harvest.  Let us  assume further 
that the  harvest  is doubled  the  following year (with  the  expendi­
ture of the same amount  of labour)  and  now=200  qrs.  If the scale 
of production remains  the  same, then  the  seed corn=20  qrs as 

=====第277页=====
Ramsay 267 
previously, but this is now only Vio of the harvest. One has to take 
into account however that the value of the 100 qrs [previously 
harvested]=that of the 200 qrs [now obtained], therefore 1 qr of 
the first harvest=2 of the second. 80 qrs remain over in the first 
case,  180 in the 2nd. Since wages are irrelevant to the present 
problem, which concerns the influence that a change in the value 
of constant capital exerts on the rate of profit, let us assume that 
the value of wages remains unchanged. Then, if [wages were] 
20 qrs in the first case, [they are] 40 in the second. Finally, let us 
assume that the value of the other ingredients of constant capital 
which the farmer does not reproduce in natura = 20 qrs in the first 
case and therefore 40 in the second. 
We now have the following calculation: 
1) The product =100 qrs. The seed  corn  = 20 qrs. The other elements 
of constant capital = 20 qrs,  wages  = 20 qrs, profit =40 qrs. 
2) The product=200 qrs. The seed  corn  = 20 qrs. The other elements 
of constant capital=40 qrs, wages=40 qrs and profit = 100 qrs, [i.e. 
its value] = 50 qrs in the first case. There would therefore be a 
SURPLUS PROFIT of 10 qrs [in the second  case]. 
Thus not [only] the rate of profit, but also the profit itself 
would have increased here, as a result of a change in the value of 
constant capital. Although wages remained the same in both 1) 
and 2), the ratio of profit to wages, that is, the rate of surplus 
value, would have risen. But this is only an illusion. The profit 
would consist firstly of 80 qrs, equal to 40 qrs in case 1), and the 
ratio to wages would remain the same; secondly, [in case] 2), of 
20 qrs, equal only to 10 qrs in case 1), which would have been 
converted into revenue from constant capital. 
But is this calculation correct? We must assume that the result 
[in case] 2) was due to a harvest which came about although work 
was carried on in the same conditions as prevailed in [case] 1). In 
order to clarify the matter, let us assume that 1 qr=£2 in [case] 1). 
This means that for the harvest which has yielded him 200 qrs, 
the farmer has laid out: 20 qrs for seed corn (=£40), 20 qrs for 
other elements of constant capital (=£40), 20 qrs for wages 
(=£40).  A total of £120, and the product=200 qrs. In the first 
case he likewise laid out only £120 (60 qrs) and the 
product=100 qrs=£200. The profit remaining was £80, or 40 qrs. 
Since the 200 qrs [in case 2)] are the product of the same amount 
of labour [as the 100 qrs in case 1)], then once again they are 
likewise=only £200. Thus, only £80 profit remains, which is now, 
however,= 140 qrs.165 Consequently, a qr now [costs the farmer] 
only £*h and not £1. In other words, the value of a qr has fallen 

=====第278页=====
268 Theories of Surplus Value 
from [£]2 to [£]4/7, that is, by ls/7, and not from 2 to 1, that is, by 
a half as we assumed above in [case] 2) as opposed to [case] 1). 
His total product [in case 2)]=200 qrs=£200. But £i20 out of 
this £200 replaces the 60 qrs which he has expended, each one of 
which cost him £2. There thus remains a profit of £80 which=the 
remaining 140 qrs. How does this happen? The qr is now=£l, but 
each of the 60 qrs expended in production cost £2. They cost the 
farmer as much as if he had expended 120 of the new qrs. The 
remaining 140 qrs therefore =£80, or no more than the remaining 
40 were worth previously. It is true that he sells each of the 
200 qrs for £1 (if he sells his total product) and receives £200 for 
them. But of the 200 qrs, 120 have cost him £2 each, the 
remaining qrs therefore only yield him £*h each. 
If he now again lays out 20 qrs [for seed] (=£10 [if one reckons 
10s. for a qr]), 40 qrs for wages (=£20), and 40 qrs for the other 
elements of constant capital (=£20), that is, a total of 100 qrs 
instead of 60 as previously and he harvests 180 qrs, then these 180 
have not the same value as did the 100 previously [if one reckons 
£1 for a qr]. True, he has employed as much living labour as he 
did previously, and consequently the [XVIII-1094] value of the 
variable capital has remained the same and so [has the value] of 
the SURPLUS  PRODUCE.  But he has laid out less objectified labour, since 
the 20 qrs, which were=£20 previously, are now worth only 10. 
The account will therefore work out as follows: 
Constant capital Variable capital Surplus value 
1) 20 qrs seed corn =£20 20 qrs (£20) 40 qrs (£40) 
20 qrs instruments of labour, 
etc. =£20 
2) 20 qrs [seed corn] =£10 
40 qrs [instruments of labour, 
etc.] =£20 40 qrs (£20) 80 qrs (£40) 
In the first case the product comes to 100 qrs=£100. 
In the second case the product comes to 180 qrs=£90. 
Nevertheless the rate of profit would have risen [despite the fall 
in the value of the product], for in the first case the return on an 
outlay of [£] 60 was £40 and in the 2nd it was 40 for an outlay of 
50. In the first case it amounted to  662/3%,  in the second to 80%. 
Anyhow, the rise in the rate of profit is not due to the value 
remaining unchanged, as Ramsay supposes. Since one part of the 
labour expended, i.e. the part contained in the constant capital (in 
seeds in this case), has diminished, the value of the product falls if 

=====第279页=====
Ramsay 269 
production continues on the same  scale,  just as the value of 100 lbs of 
twist falls if the cotton it is made of becomes cheaper. But the 
ratio of variable to constant capital increases (without the value of 
the variable capital increasing). In other words, the ratio of the 
total capital outlay declines in relation to the SURPLUS. HENCE the rate 
of profit rises. 
If what Ramsay says were correct, if the value remained the 
same, then the profit, the amount of profit, and consequently also 
the rate of profit, would rise. There can be no question of a rise 
merely in the rate [of profit]. 
The question is not however disposed of for the special case. In 
agriculture this special case takes the following form: A certain 
amount of seed corn at the old price of the product figures in the 
harvest, this part is incorporated in the harvest in natura. The 
other expenses are defrayed by the sale of the corn at its old price. 
The old outlay yields a product which is twice as big as before. 
Thus,  in the above-mentioned case, for example, where 20 qrs are 
used as seed corn (=£40) and the other outlays=40 qrs (=£80), 
the harvest yields 200 qrs and not, as the previous harvest, 100 qrs 
(=£200), of which 40 qrs=£80 were profit on a total outlay of 
60 qrs=£120. The outlay in connection with this [second] harvest 
is absolutely the same as it was in the first—60 qrs, the value of 
which is £120, but instead of a SURPLUS of 40 qrs, the SURPLUS is now 
140 qrs. The SURPLUS in natura has in this case increased 
considerably. But because the labour expended is the same in both 
CASES,  the 200 qrs have no greater value than did the 100, that is, 
£200.  In other words [the value of] the qr has fallen from £2 to 
£1. But since there was a SURPLUS of 140 qrs, it seemed that it had 
to come to £140, for one qr is worth just as much as any other. 
The matter would be simplified if we considered it d'abord 
without regard to the reproduction process, that is, if we assumed 
that the tenant farmer was withdrawing from the business and 
selling his whole product. Then he would indeed have to sell 
120 qrs to recover his outlay of £120 (to reimburse himself). In 
this way he would recover the capital advanced. Thus a SURPLUS of 
80 qrs would remain, and not of 140, and since these 80 qrs=£40, 
they are worth in absolute terms as much as the SURPLUS in the first 
case. 
In the course of the reproduction process, however, the matter is 
altered to a certain extent. For the farmer replaces the 20 qrs of 
seed corn in natura out of his own product. [As far as their value 
is concerned] they are replaced by 40 qrs in the product. But in 
the reproduction process he only needs to replace them with 

=====第280页=====
270 Theories  of Surplus Value 
20 qrs in  natura,  as was the  case previously.  The  rest  of his 
expenditure [expressed  in quarters] increases  in the  same ratio  as 
the qr is  devalued (provided wages  do not  fall).  To replace  the 
remaining portion  of constant capital,  he now  needs  40 qrs and 
not 20 as  previously,  and to  replace wages  he also needs  40 qrs 
instead  of 20.  Altogether  he must  now lay out 100 qrs,  compared 
to 60  previously;  but he  need  not lay out 120, the  amount 
corresponding  to the  depreciation  of the  corn, because  the 20 qrs 
[used  as seed] which were worth  £40, are  replaced  by 20 
[quarters] (since  in this context only their  use  value matters) which 
are worth [£]20.  So evidently  he has  made  a gain [XVIII-1095]  of 
these  20 qrs, now  worth  £20. His  SURPLUS  is therefore  not £80 but 
£100,  not 80 qrs, but 100.  (Expressed  in qrs of the old  value,  not 
40 but 50.)  This  is an  unquestionable FACT,  and if the  market price 
does  not  fall as a  result  of ABUNDANCE,  the  farmer  can  sell  20 qrs 
more  at the new  value, thus gaining  £20. In the  course  of 
reproduction, moreover,  the  farmer obtains this SURPLUS  of £20 on 
the same outlay, because labour  has  become more productive, 
without  the  rate  of surplus value having risen  or the  workers 
having performed more SURPLUS labour than previously  or having 
received  a smaller portion  of the  reproduced part  of the  product 
(which represents living labour).  On the  contrary,  it is  assumed 
that in the  reproduction process  the  worker receives  40 qrs, 
whereas  he received only  20 previously. This then  is a  rather 
peculiar phenomenon.  It does  not  occur without reproduction,  but 
it takes place  in connection with  it and it  takes place [moreover] 
because  the  farmer replaces  a PART  OF HIS ADVANCES  in natura.  Not only 
the rate  of profit could increase  in this case,  but the  amount  of 
profit  as well. (With regard  to the  reproduction process  itself, the 
farmer  can  either carry  on on the old  scale,  in which case  the price 
of the  product will fall  if he  again obtains  as good  a harvest, 
because  a portion  of the  constant capital  has  cost less,  but the  rate 
of profit will rise;  or the  farmer  can  increase  the  scale  of 
production,  sow  more with  the  same outlay,  and  then both  the 
rate of profit  and the  amount  of profit will rise.) 
Let us consider  the  manufacturer.  Let us  assume that  he has 
laid out £100 in  cotton twist  and  made  a profit  of [£]20.  The 
product therefore=[£]120.  It is  assumed that  [£]80 out of the 
outlay  of £100 has  been paid  for cotton.  If the  price  of cotton falls 
by half, he  will  now  need  to spend only  40 on the  cotton  and £20 
on the  rest, that  is £60 in all  (instead  of £100);  the  profit will  be 
[£]20  as previously  and the  total product will amount  to £80 (if he 
does  not  increase  the  scale  of his  production).  £40  thus remains  in 

=====第281页=====
Ramsay  271 
his pocket. He can either spend it or invest it as additional capital. 
If he invests it, he will lay out [an additional] [£]26 2/ä on cotton 
and 13'/3 on labour, etc., on the new scale. The profit [will amount 
to] £13Vs. The total product will now be 60+40 +  337s,  or £133V 3. 
Thus it is not the fact that the farmer replaces his seed corn in 
natura which is the key, for the manufacturer buys his cotton and 
does not replace it out of his own product. What this phenomenon 
amounts to is this: release of a portion of the capital previously 
tied up in constant capital, or the conversion of a portion of the 
capital into revenue. If exactly the same amount of capital is laid 
out in the reproduction process as previously, then it is the same 
aS if  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL  HAD  BEEN EMPLOYED  Oil the old  SCale  of 
production. This is therefore a kind of accumulation which arises 
from the increased productivity of those branches of industry 
which supply the productive ingredients of capital. However, such 
a fall in the [price of] raw materials, IF DUE TO THE  SEASONS,  IS 
COUNTERACTED BY UNFAVOURABLE SEASONS, IN WHICH THE RAW MATERIALS ap­
preciate. The capital released in this way  IN ONE or several  SEASONS  is, 
therefore, to a certain extent, reserve capital for the other seasons. 
For instance, the  MANUFACTURER  whose [fixed capital] turns over once 
every 12 years, must arrange things in such a way that he can 
continue to produce—at least on the same scale—throughout the 
12 years. One has therefore to take into account that the  PRICES  [of 
the raw materials] he has to  REPLACE  fluctuate and even themselves 
out MORE  OR LESS over a long period of years. 
A rise in prices of the ingredients [of constant capital] has the 
opposite effect to a fall of the prices. (We are leaving variable 
capital out of account here, although if wages fall, less variable 
capital—in terms of value—will need to be laid out, and if they 
rise, more.) If production is to be continued on the old scale, then 
a greater outlay of capital is necessary. Therefore, apart from a 
fall in the rate of profit, extra  CAPITAL  MUST  BE EMPLOYED  OR A PART  OF the 
REVENUE  MUST BE  CONVERTED  INTO  CAPITAL,  although it will not have the 
effect of  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL. 
ACCUMULATION  has taken place in the one case although the value 
of the capital advanced has remained the same (but its physical 
elements have been increased). The rate of valorisation increases, 
and the absolute magnitude of profit increases, because the effect 
is the same AS IF  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL  had been advanced on the old 
scale. Accumulation has taken place in the other case in so  FAR AS the 
value of the capital advanced, i.e. that part of the value of the total 
output which functions as capital, has increased. But the physical 
elements have not been increased. The rate of profit falls. (The 

=====第282页=====
272 Theories  of Surplus Value 
amount  of profit only falls  if either  a different number  of workers 
is employed  or if  their wages rise  as well.) 
This phenomenon  of the  conversion  of  capital into revenue 
should  be  noted, because  it creates  the  illusion that  the  amount  of 
profit grows  (or in the  opposite case decreases) independently  of 
the amount  of  surplus value.  We  have seen that, under 
[XVIII-1096] certain circumstances, a  PART OF RENT  can be explained 
by this phenomenon.166 
In the way  mentioned above (that  is, if the  remaining 
20 qrs=£20  are not  used immediately  to  extend  the  scale  of 
production,  i.e. if  they  are not  accumulated),  a money capital  of 
£20 is set  free. This  is an  example  of how  redundant money capital 
can be  extracted from  the  reproduction process although  the 
aggregate value  of commodities remains  the  same, namely,  by a 
portion  of the  capital which existed previously  in the  form  of fixed 
(constant) capital being converted into money capital. 
How little  the  above phenomenon  has  to do  with  the  determina­
tion of the  rate of profit, becomes clear  if one  considers  the  case  of 
A FARMER  (or  * manufacturer)  who  enters business under  the new 
conditions  of production. Formerly  he  wanted  a capital  of £120  to 
enter  the  business,  £40 to buy 20 qrs [of]  seeds,  £40 for  other 
ingredients  of  constant capital,  and £40 to pay  wages.  And his 
profit  was  £80.*  80 on  120  = 8 on  12 = 2 on  3,=662/3%-
HE now  HAS  TO ADVANCE  £20  TO  BUY 20 qrs  OF SEED,  £40  AS previously 
[to buy the  other elements  of constant capital],  £40  FOR WAGES,  SO 
THAT  HIS  OUTLAY  OF  CAPITAL=[£]  100. AND profit is 80, that is 80%. THE 
AMOUNT OF PROFIT HAS REMAINED THE SAME, BUT  ITS  RATE HAS INCREASED  by  20%. 
Thus one can see that the fall in the value of  SEED  (or of the  PRICE 
which  has  to be  paid  to replace  the  seed)  has  in itself nothing  to do 
with the  increase  in the  amount  of profit,  but  implies merely  an 
INCREASE  in THE  RATE  OF PROFIT. 
Moreover, the  FARMER  in the one case—or the  MANUFACTURER  in the 
other—will  not  consider that  he has  obtained  a larger profit,  but 
that a portion  of the  capital previously tied  up in  production  has 
been freed.  And his  view will  be  based  on the  following simple 
calculation. Previously,  the  capital advanced  in  production 
was = [£]120;  now  it=100, while  20 is now in the  hands  of the 
FARMER  as free capital, money which  can be  invested  in  ANY way  he 
likes.  But in  either  CASE  the  capital=120  ONLY,  its size has  therefore 
not been increased.  The  fact, however, that  l/6 of the  capital  has 
been divested  of the  form  in  which  it is  inseparable from  the 
reproduction process does indeed have  the  same effect  as an 
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

Ramsay has not got to the bottom of this matter because he has 
not at all clearly worked out the relationship between value, 
surplus value and profit. 
Ramsay correctly expounds to what extent machinery, etc., in so 
FAR AS IT AFFECTS VARIABLE CAPITAL, influences profit and the rate of 
profit.167 That is to say, he shows that this influence results from 
the depreciation of labour capacity, the increase of relative SURPLUS 
labour or, if the reproduction process is considered as a whole, 
also the reduction of the PART  OF THE  GROSS  RETURN WHICH  GOES  TO REPLACE 
WAGES. 
* "An increased or diminished productiveness  * of the industry  * employed in 
raising commodities which do not enter into the composition of fixed capital,* can 
have no influence on the rate of profit, * except by affecting the proportion of the 
gross amount which goes to maintain labour"* ([p.] 168). 
"If the manufacturer has doubled his output as a result of improvements in 
machinery, the value of his GOODS MUST, in the end, FALL in the same proportion as 
their quantity has increased." 
//It is assumed that in fact, taking the wear and tear of the 
machinery into account, twice the quantity costs no more than half 
did previously. Otherwise the  VALUE  [of the single commodity] falls, 
*but not in proportion to its quantity. Its quantity may double, 
while its value, the value of the single commodity, like that of the 
aggregate product, may sink only, instead of from 2:1, from 2:IV4, 
etc.*// 
"...and the  MANUFACTURER  benefits only in so far as he is able to clothe the 
worker more cheaply so that  A SMALLER PROPORTION  of the gross  RETURN  goes to the 
worker... The farmer too benefits //as a result of the increased industrial 
productivity// only in so far as a portion of his outlay is expended on  CLOTHING  for 
THE LABOURER  and he can buy this more cheaply now; that is, in the same way as 
the MANUFACTURER"  ([pp.] 168-69). 
A fall [or rise] in the value of the INGREDIENTS of constant capital 
affects the rate of profit by altering the ratio of surplus value to the 
total capital outlay. A fall (or rise) in wages, on the other hand, 
[affects the rate of profit] by influencing the rate of surplus value 
directly. 
SUPPOSE for example, that, in the above-mentioned case, the price 
of the seed (assuming the FARMER grows FLAX) remains the same, 
that is, £40 (20 qrs) and the rest of the constant capital costs £40 
(20 qrs), but that wages—that is, wages for the same number of 
workers—fall from £40 to 20 (from 20 qrs to 10). In this case, the 
total [newly created] value, which=the wages+surplus value, 
remains unchanged. Since the number of workers remains the 
same, their labour is embodied in a value of 40 + 80=£120, as it 
was previously. But from this £120, 20 now goes to the workers

274 Theories  of Surplus Value 
and the surplus value now amounts to 100. //It is assumed that no 
improvements have taken place which affect  THE  NUMBER  OF LABOURERS 
EMPLOYED  in this BRANCH.// The capital advanced is now 100 instead 
of 120 just as in the case where the value of the seed fell by  half. 
But the profit is now [£]100, i.e. 100%, whereas in the other case, 
where the capital advanced was likewise reduced from 120 to 100, 
it was 80%. And as in that other case [£]20, or '/Ô of the capital, 
[XVIII-1097] is set free. But in the former case, the surplus value 
remained unchanged — [£]80 — (and since 40 was paid as wages, 
[the rate of surplus value] was 200%). In the latter case, the 
surplus value rises to 100 (and, since wages now come to [£]20, 
[the rate of surplus value increases] to 500%). 
In this case, not only has the rate of profit risen but the profit 
itself,  because the rate of surplus value has risen and consequently 
the surplus value  itself.  This differentiates this  CASE  from the other, 
something which Ramsay does not grasp. This always takes place 
when the increase in profit is not nullified by a corresponding 
reduction in the rate of profit resulting from a simultaneous 
CHANGE  in the  VALUE  of constant  capital.  In the  above-mentioned 
case,  for example, the capital laid out is [£]120 and the profit 80, 
that is,  66 2/3%.  In the present case, the capital outlay is 100 and 
the profit 100=100%. If, however, the capital outlay had risen 
from 100 to 150 as a result of a CHANGE in the price of constant 
capital, then the profit—which has increased from 80 to 
100—would only give a rate of 66 2A%. 
[Because]  "SUCH COMMODITIES HELP TO MAKE UP NEITHER FIXED CAPITAL NOR 
CIRCULATING,  [it follows that] profit can in no way be affected by any ALTERATION in 
their  PRODUCTIVENESS. »Such are luxuries of all  kinds"  ([pp.] 169-70). 
"Master-capitalists  gain by the abundance of luxuries because their profits will 
command  a greater quantity for their private consumption; but the rate of this 
profit  is in no degree affected either by their plenty or scarcity*" ([p.] 171). 
D'abord, a portion of the LUXURIES can be used as one of the 
ingredients OF CONSTANT CAPITAL. Grapes, for example, in [the 
production of] wine, gold in luxury articles, diamonds in glass 
cutting, etc. But Ramsay excludes this  CASE  in so FAR as he says: 
COMMODITIES  which do not ENTER into FIXED CAPITAL. In that case, 
however, the concluding  sentence—"SUCH  ARE  LUXURIES  OF ALL  KINDS", 
is incorrect. 
However, productivity in the luxury industries can only increase 
in the same way as it does in all others—either because natural 
resources such as the land, mines, etc., from which the RAW 
MATERIALS  for LUXURIES are procured, become more productive, or 
new, more productive sources are discovered; or again by

application of the division of labour, or, especially, by the use of 
machinery (or of better tools) and of natural forces. //The 
improvement of tools and their increasing differentiation be­
longs to the division of labour.// (One should not forget chemical 
processes.) 
Let us now assume that the production time for LUXURIES is 
reduced due to machinery (or chemical processes), that less labour 
is required to produce them. This cannot have the slightest 
influence on wages, on the value of labour capacity, since these 
articles do not enter into the consumption of the workers (at least 
never into that part of their consumption which determines the 
value of their labour capacity). //It can influence the market price 
of labour, if workers are thrown onto the streets as a result of 
these developments and the influx onto the labour market is 
thereby increased.// Increased productivity in the luxury indus­
tries,  therefore, has no influence on the rate of surplus value nor, 
consequently, on the rate of profit in so far as this is determined 
by the rate of surplus value. Nevertheless, it can indeed 
influence the rate of profit in so far as it affects either the amount 
of surplus value or the ratio of variable capital to constant capital 
and to the total capital. If, for example, machinery makes it 
possible to employ 10 workers where 20 were previously em­
ployed, then, indeed, the rate of surplus value is not modified in 
any way. The cheapening of luxury articles does not enable the 
worker to live more cheaply. He requires the same amount of 
labour time to reproduce his labour capacity as he did previously. 
//In practice, therefore, the manufacturer of luxury articles 
seeks to depress the wages of labour below its value, [below] its 
minimum. This he is able to do because of the relative surplus 
POPULATION engendered by increasing productivity in other 
branches of industry, for example among knitters. Or—as likewise 
happens in these branches—he seeks to extend the absolute labour 
time, thus, in fact, producing absolute surplus value. It is correct, 
however, that productivity in the luxury industries cannot reduce 
the value of labour capacity, it cannot produce any relative SURPLUS 
value and, in general, cannot produce that form of surplus value 
which results from the growing productivity of industry as such.// 
The amount of surplus value is determined in two ways: by the 
rate of surplus value, that is, the surplus labour (absolute or 
relative) of the individual workers; secondly, by the number of 
workers simultaneously employed. In so far therefore as increas­
ing productivity in the luxury industry reduces the number of 
workers which a certain quantity of capital employs, it reduced the 

=====第286页=====
276 Theories  of Surplus Value 
amount  of surplus value.  HENCE ALL OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES REMAINING THE 
SAME, [it  reduces also]  the  rate of profit.  The  same thing occurs  if the 
number  of workers  is reduced,  or remains the same,  but the  capital 
laid out on  machinery  and raw  materials  is increased;  in other 
words,  [it occurs] wherever there  is any DIMINUTION in the  ratio  of 
variable capital  to the  total capital which  is not  balanced  or 
partially offset  by a  reduction  in wages.  But  since  the  rate of profit 
in this sphere [XVIII-1098] enters into  the  equalisation process  of 
the general rate  of profit just  as much  as that in any  other sphere, 
increased productivity  in the  luxury industry would,  in the  case 
under consideration, bring about  a fall in the  general rate  of 
profit. 
Conversely:  If the  increased productivity  in the  luxury industry 
was [due to  improvements carried  out] not in  that industry  itself, 
but in those branches  of industry which provide  it with constant 
capital, then  the  rate  of profit would rise  in the  luxury industry. 
//Surplus value (that  is, its  size,  its quantity,  ITS TOTAL AMOUNT) is 
determined  by the  rate of surplus value multiplied  by the  number 
of workers employed. Certain circumstances may affect both factors 
simultaneously either  in the  same direction  or in  opposite 
directions,  or they  may  affect only  one of the  factors. Apart from 
the absolute lengthening  of the  working day, increased productivi­
ty in the  luxury industry  can  affect only  the  number  [of  workers 
employed].  The  inevitable consequence therefore  is a  reduction  in 
the amount  of surplus value  and  hence  in the  rate of profit, even 
if no increase  in constant capital takes place.  If the  constant capital 
does increase, however,  a reduced amount  of surplus value  is 
calculated  on an  increased total capital.// 
Ramsay comes closer  to a  correct understanding  of the  rate  of 
profit than  the  others.  The SHORTCOMINGS too are  therefore more 
conspicuous  in his  exposition.  He  brings  out all the  factors 
involved,  but he  does  it one-sidedly  and  therefore incorrectly. 
Ramsay sums  up his  view  of profit  in the  following passage: 
"The rate  of  profit  IN  INDIVIDUAL CASES  is therefore determined  by the 
following causes:  1) The  productiveness  of the  industry  ENGAGED  IN RAISING  the 
ARTICLES  OF  FIRST NECESSITY which  are  required  by the  labourer  for  FOOD, 
CLOTHING,  etc.; 2) the  productiveness  of the  industry employed  IN  RAISING  THE 
OBJECTS WHICH ENTER INTO THE COMPOSITION  OF  FIXED CAPITAL;  3) THE  RATE OF REAL 
WAGES." 
//Here this must mean  the  quantity  of NECESSARIES,  etc., which  the 
worker receives,  WHATEVER  BE THE price  OF THE ARTICLES COMPOSING IT.// 
"A VARIATION  IN the 1st and 3rd of  these  * causes acts upon profit  by  altering 
the proportion  of the  gross produce which goes  to the  labourer:  a change  in the

second affects  the  same,  by modifying  the  proportion necessary  for  replacing, either 
directly  or by means  of exchange,  the fixed capital consumed  in production;  for  profit 
is essentially  a question  of proportion*"  ([p.] 172). 
He rightly reproaches Ricardo (although Ramsay's  own  presen­
tation  is also inadequate): 
"Ricardo overlooks  the  fact that  the  whole product  is not  only divided  up 
between  WAGES  and  PROFITS,  but that a part of it is also  NECESSARY  FOR  REPLACING 
FIXED CAPITAL"  ([p.] 174, note). 
//It can  already  be noted  in the  first description  of accumula­
tion, i.e. of the  conversion OF SURPLUS VALUE INTO CAPITAL, that  the 
entire SURPLUS LABOUR takes  the  form  of  capital (constant  and 
variable)  and of  SURPLUS  LABOUR  (profit, interest, rent).  For  this 
CONVERSION reveals that SURPLUS LABOUR itself assumes  the  form  of 
capital  and  that the  unpaid labour  of the  worker confronts  him as 
the totality  of the  objective conditions  of labour.  In this form  it 
confronts  him as  alien property with  the  result that  the  capital 
which  is antecedent  to his  labour, appears  to be  independent  of it. 
[It appears]  as a  ready-made value  of a  given magnitude, whose 
value  the  worker merely  has to  augment.  It is  never  the  product 
of his  past labour  (nor  ANY  CIRCUMSTANCES which, independently  of the 
particular labour process into which  the  past labour  of his  enters, 
affect  or increase  its value) which,  or the  replacement  of which, 
appears  as exploitation,  but it is  always merely  the  manner  and the 
rate in which  his  present labour  is exploited.  As  long  as the 
individual capitalist continues  to operate  on the  same scale  of 
production  (or on an  expanding one),  the  replacement  of capital 
appears  as an  operation which does  not  affect  the  worker, since,  if 
the conditions  of production belonged  to the  worker,  he would 
likewise have  to replace them  out of the  GROSS  PRODUCE  in order  to 
continue reproduction  on the  same scale  or on an  expanded scale 
(and the  latter  too is  necessary because  of the  NATURAL INCREASE OF 
POPULATION).  But  this affects  the  worker  in three respects:  1) The 
perpetuation  of the  conditions  of production  as property alien  to 
him, as capital, perpetuates  his  condition  as wage worker  and 
hence  his  fate of always having  to work part  of his  labour time  for 
a third person  for  nothing;  2) the  extension  of these conditions  of 
production, alias accumulation  of capital, increases  the  extent  and 
the size  of the  classes WHO LIVE UPON HIS SURPLUS LABOUR;  it worsens  HIS 
POSITION  RELATIVELY  BY  AUGMENTING  THE  RELATIVE  WEALTH  OF the  Capitalist  AND 
HIS COPARTNERS,  by  further increasing  his  RELATIVE SURPLUS labour 
through  the  division  of labour,  etc., and  reduces that part  of the 
GROSS  PRODUCE which  is used  to pay  wages;  [3]  finally, since  the 
conditions  of labour confront  the  individual worker  in an  ever

more gigantic form and increasingly as social forces, the chance of 
his taking possession of them himself as is the case in small-scale 
industry, disappears.// 
[XVIII-1099] Ramsay uses the term  GROSS PROFIT  for what I call 
simply profit. He divides this  GROSS PROFIT  into  NET  PROFIT  (interest) 
and  PROFIT OF  ENTERPRISE  (industrial profit). 
Ramsay, like Ricardo, takes issue with Adam Smith on the 
question of the fall in the  GENERAL RATE OF PROFIT. 
Refuting Smith, he writes: 
"COMPETITION  of the  MASTER-CAPITALISTS  can  indeed  LEVEL  the  profits rising 
especially high above  the  level" //this  LEVELLING  is by no  means  a sufficient 
explanation  for the  formation  of a  GENERAL RATE  OF PROFIT//  "but it is  wrong  to say 
THAT  THIS  ORDINARY LEVEL ITSELF  IS LOWERED"  ([pp.]  179-80).a 
"Were  it possible that  the  price  *of  every commodity, both  raw and  fabricated, 
should fall  in consequence  of the  competition among  the  producers,  yet  this could 
not in any way  affect profit. Each master-capitalist would sell  his produce  for  less 
money, but,*  on the  other hand, * every article  of his  expenses, whether belonging 
to fixed capital  or to  circulating, would cost  him a  proportionally smaller  sum" 
([pp.] 180-81). 
Ditto against Malthus: 
* "The idea  of profits being paid  by the  consumers,  is, assuredly, very absurd. 
Who  are the  consumers? They must  be  either landlords, capitalists, masters, 
labourers,  or else people  who  receive  a salary,  etc." ([p.] 183). 
"The only competition which  can  affect  the  general rate  of gross profits,  is that 
between master-capitalists  and  labourers"  * ([p.] 206). 
The last sentence expresses the true gist of Ricardo's proposi­
tion. The rate of profit can fall independently of the  COMPETITION 
BETWEEN  CAPITAL  and  LABOUR,  but this is the only kind of  COMPETITION 
which can bring about its decrease. Ramsay  himself,  however, 
does not advance any reasons why the general rate of profit has a 
tendency to fall. The only thing he says—and which is correct—is 
that the rate of interest can fall quite independently of the  RATE  OF 
GROSS  PROFITS  in a given country, namely: 
"But  were  we  even  to suppose,  that  CAPITAL  WAS  NEVER BORROWED WITH  ANY 
VIEW BUT  TO  PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT,  it is  possible that interest might vary without 
ANY CHANGE  IN THE  RATE  OF  GROSS PROFITS.  For, as A  NATION ADVANCES  IN THE 
CAREER  OF  WEALTH,  A CLASS  OF  MEN  SPRINGS  UP  AND  INCREASES  more  and  more,  who 
by the  labours" //EXPLOITATION, ROBBERY//  "of  their ANCESTORS find themselves  in 
the possession  of FUNDS  sufficiently ample  to afford  a handsome maintenance from 
the interest alone. Very many also  who  during youth  and  middle  age  were actively 
engaged  in business, retire  in their latter days  to live quietly  on the  interest  of the 
sums they have themselves accumulated. These  two  classes have  a tendency  to

TOLERABLE STOCK ARE LIKELY  TO MAKE  AN INDEPENDENCE SOONER THAN THEY WHO 
COMMENCE WITH LITTLE.  Therefore, in old and rich countries, the  AMOUNT  of 
NATIONAL CAPITAL belonging  to those  who are  unwilling  to take  the  trouble  of 
employing it themselves,  BEARS  A LARGER PROPORTION  TO  THE  WHOLE PRODUCTIVE 
STOCK  OF  THE  SOCIETY, than  IN  NEWLY SETTLED  AND  POOR COUNTRIES.  How  numerous 
[is] the  CLASS  OF  RENTIERS  IN ENGLAND!  AS  THE  CLASS  OF  RENTIERS INCREASES,  SO  ALSO 
DOES THAT  OF  LENDERS  OF  CAPITAL,  FOR  THEY  ARE ONE AND THE  SAME.  For  this reason 
alone, interest must have  had a  tendency  to fall in old  countries"  ([p.] 201  sqq.). 
Ramsay says about  the  RATE  OF  NET  PROFIT  (interest) that  it 
"depends partly upon  the  RATE  OF  GROSS PROFITS,  partly  on the  proportion  in 
which these  are  separated into interest  and  industrial profit. This proportion 
depends upon the  COMPETITION  between the  LENDERS  and  BORROWERS  OF  CAPITAL. 
This COMPETITION  is influenced, though  by no  means ENTIRELY regulated, BY  THE 
RATE  OF  GROSS PROFIT EXPECTED  TO BE  REALISED.  And the  COMPETITION  is not 
exclusively regulated  by this  CAUSE  because  on the  one  hand many borrow without 
ANY VIEW  TO  PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT,  and, on the other, because the  PROPORTION  of 
the * whole  national capital  to be lent, varies with  the  riches  of the country independent  of 
any change  in gross profits" ([pp.] 206-07).  "The  profits  of enterprise depend upon the  net 
profits  of capital,  not the  latter upon  the  former"*  ([p.] 214). 
[XVIII-1100] Apart from  the  circumstance mentioned earlier, 
Ramsay says—rightly: 
"Interest  is only  a measure  OF  INDUSTRIAL PROFITS  where  the  level  of civilisation 
is such that  the  WANT OF CERTAINTY OF REPAYMENT  is not a  factor which enters into 
the calculation... 3 In England,  for  instance,  at the present day,  WE CANNOT  consider 
COMPENSATION  FOR  RISK  AS AT  ALL ENTERING INTO THE INTEREST RECEIVED FROM FUNDS 
[lent] ON  WHAT WOULD  BE  CALLED GOOD SECURITY"  ([p.] 199, note). 
Speaking  of the  INDUSTRIAL  capitalist, whom  he  calls  the  MASTER-
CAPITALIST,  Ramsay remarks: 
"The industrial capitalist  is the  general  DISTRIBUTOR  of wealth;  he pays  to the 
LABOURERS,  the  WAGES,  to the  capitalist,  the  interest,  to the proprietor,  the  rent.  On 
the one  hand  are  MASTERS,  on the  other,  LABOURERS,  CAPITALISTS  and  * landlords. 
The interests  of these  two  grand classes  are  diametrically opposed  to each other.  It 
is the  master  who  hires labour, capital,  and  land,  and of  course tries  to get the use 
of them  on as  low  terms  as possible; while  the  owners  of these sources  of wealth  do 
their best  to let  them  as high  as they can*" ([pp.] 218-19). 
INDUSTRIAL  PROFIT. (LABOUR  OF  SUPERINTENDENCE.) 
What Ramsay writes about  INDUSTRIAL  profit  (and  especially, about 
the LABOUR  OF SUPERINTENDENCE)  is on the  whole  the  most reasonable 
part  of his  book, although part  of his  DEMONSTRATION  is borrowed 
from Storch. 
The exploitation  of labour costs labour.  In so far as the  labour 
performed  by the  INDUSTRIAL  capitalist  is rendered necessary only

into the  cost  of his  OVERLOOKERS  (the  industrial non-commissioned 
officers)  and is  already included  in the  category  of  WAGES  in the 
same  way  as costs caused  by the  slave overlooker  and  his whip  are 
included  in the  production costs  of the  slave-owner. These costs, 
like the  greater part  of the  trading expenses, belong  to the  faux 
frais of capitalist production.  As far as the  general rate  of profit  is 
concerned,  the  labour  of the  capitalists arising from their 
competition with  one  another  and  their attempts  to  ruin  one 
another counts just  as  little  as the  greater  or  lesser skill  of one 
industrial capitalist compared  to another  in extracting  the  largest 
amount  of  SURPLUS LABOUR  from  his  workers  for the  smallest 
expenditure  and  making  the  best  use of  this extracted  SURPLUS 
LABOUR  in the  process  of circulation. These matters should  be  dealt 
with in the  analysis  of the  competition  of  capitals. 67 Such  an 
analysis deals  in general with  the  struggle  of the  capitalists  and 
their effort  to  acquire  THE  GREATEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF SURPLUS LABOUR 
and it is  concerned only with  the  division  of the  surplus labour 
amongst  the  different individual capitalists,  and not  with  -the 
origin  of surplus labour  or its  GENERAL EXTENT. 
All that remains  for the  LABOUR  OF SUPERINTENDENCE  is the  general 
function  of  organising  the  division  of labour  and the  cooperation 
of certain individuals. This labour  is fully taken into account  in the 
WAGES  of the  GENERAL MANAGER  in the  larger capitalist enterprises.  It 
has already been deducted from  the  general rate  of profit.  The 
best practical proof  of this is provided  by  the cooperative factories 
set up by the  English workers,168  for  these, despite  the  higher rate 
of interest they have  to pay,  yield profits higher than  AVERAGE, 
although  the  WAGES  of the  GENERAL MANAGER,  which  are  naturally 
determined  by the  market price  for  this kind  of  labour,  are 
deducted.  The  industrial capitalists  who are  their  own  GENERAL 
MANAGERS  save  one  ITEM  of the  production costs,  pay  WAGES  to 
themselves,  and  consequently receive  a rate  of profit above  the 
average.  If this assertion  of the  apologists were taken literally 
tomorrow,  and the  profit  of the  INDUSTRIAL  capitalist limited  to the 
WAGES  OF MANAGEMENT  AND  DIRECTION,  then capitalist production,  the 
appropriation  of the  SURPLUS  labour  of others  and its  transforma­
tion into capital would come  to an end the day  after tomorrow. 
However,  if we  consider this [payment  of the]  LABOUR  OF 
SUPERINTENDENCE  as WAGES  concealed in the  GENERAL  RATE  OF PROFIT,  then 
the law  established  by  Ramsay3  and  others applies, namely, that

while profit (industrial profit  as well  as GROSS  profit)  is proportional 
to the  amount  of capital advanced, this portion  of the  profit stands 
in inverse ratio  to the  size  of the  capital,  it is  infinitesimally small 
in the  case  of large capital  and  enormously large where  the  capital 
is small,  i.e.  where  the  capitalist production  is purely nominal. 
Whereas  the  small capitalist,  who  does almost  all the  work  himself, 
seems  to obtain  a very high rate  of profit  in proportion  to his 
capital, what happens  in fact  is that,  if he  does  not  employ  a few 
workers whose surplus labour  he appropriates,  he actually makes 
no profit  at all and his  enterprise  is only nominally  a capitalist  one 
(whether  he is  engaged  in industry  or in  commerce). What 
distinguishes  him  from  the  wages worker  is that, because  of his 
nominal capital,  he is  indeed  the  master  and  owner  of his own 
conditions  of labour  and  consequently  has no  MASTER over  him; 
[XVIII-1101]  and  hence  he appropriates  his  whole labour time 
himself instead  of it  being appropriated  by someone else. What 
appears  to be  profit here,  is merely  the  excess over ordinary  WAGES, 
an excess which results from  the  fact that  he appropriates  his own 
SURPLUS  LABOUR. However, this phenomenon belongs exclusively  to 
those spheres which have  not as yet  been really conquered  by the 
capitalist mode  of production. 
"The profits OF  ENTERPRISE  may be  considered  as made  up of 3  parts:  1) the 
salary of the  MASTER;  2) [an insurance for] his RISK; 3) his  SURPLUS  GAINS"  ([p.] 
226). 
As regards point  2) it is  quite irrelevant here. Corbet3  (and 
Ramsay himselfb)  has  stated that  the  INSURANCE  which covers  the 
risk only distributes  the  LOSSES  of the  capitalists uniformly  or 
distributes them more generally amongst  the  whole class.  The 
profits  of the  INSURANCE  COMPANIES—that  is, of the  capitals which  are 
EMPLOYED  IN THE  BUSINESS  OF INSURANCE,  and  take over this distribution— 
must  be deducted from these uniformly distributed losses. These 
COMPANIES  receive  a part  of the  surplus value  in the  same  way as 
MERCANTILE  or MONIED  CAPITALISTS  do, without participating in its direct 
production. This  is a  question  of the  distribution  of the  SURPLUS 
VALUE  amongst  the  different sorts  of capitalists  and of the 
deductions which  are  consequently made from  [the  surplus value 
accruing  to] the  individual capitalists.  It has  nothing  to do  either 
with the  nature  or with  the  extent  of the  SURPLUS.  The  worker 
obviously cannot provide  any  more than  his  SURPLUS labour.  He 
cannot make  an additional payment  to the  capitalist  so that  the

latter may insure the fruits of this SURPLUS labour against loss. At 
most one could say that, even APART  FROM  capitalist production, the 
producers themselves might have certain expenses, that is, they 
would have to spend a part of their labour, or of the products of 
their labour in order to insure their products, their wealth, or the 
elements of their wealth, against accidents, etc. Instead of each 
capitalist insuring  himself,  it is safer as well as cheaper for him if 
one section of capital is entrusted with this job. INSURANCE is paid 
out of a portion of SURPLUS VALUE, its protection and distribution 
between the capitalists has nothing to do with its origin and 
extent. 
What is left is 1) the SALARY and 2) the SURPLUS GAINS, as Ramsay 
calls that part of  SURPLUS  VALUE  which falls to the industrial capitalist 
as opposed to the interest-grabber and which, consequently, is 
determined absolutely by the ratio of interest to industrial profitai. e. 
the ratio between] the two parts into which the SURPLUS VALUE accruing 
to capital (in contrast to landed property) is divided. 
As far as 1), the SALARY, is concerned, it is d'abord self-evident 
that in capitalist production, the function of capital as lord over 
labour falls to the capitalist, or a clerk or a representative paid by 
him. Even this function would disappear together with the 
capitalist production, in so far as it does not arise from the nature 
of cooperative labour but from the domination of the conditions 
of labour over labour  itself.  Ramsay himself however sweeps away 
this element or reduces it to such an extent that it is not WORTH 
SPEAKING OF. 
"The  SALARY  [of the employer], like the labour [of superintendence], remains 
roughly the same, be the  CONCERN  large or small" ([pp.] 227, 229). "A worker will 
never be able to say that he can do the same amount of work as 2, 3 or more of his 
workmates. But one industrial  CAPITALIST  or FARMER  can take the place of 10 or 
15" ([p.] 255). 
The 3rd part, the  SURPLUS  GAINS,  includes [compensation for] 
risks—which are only possible risks, nothing but the possibility of 
losing the GAINS and the capital—it in fact however takes the form 
of INSURANCE and therefore of a share which certain capitals in a 
particular branch receive in the total SURPLUS VALUE. 
"These  SURPLUS GAINS,"  Ramsay writes, * "do truly represent the revenue 
derived from the power of commanding the use of capital" * Hin other words from the 
* power of commanding other people's labour// "whether belonging to the person 
himself or borrowed from others...* the NET  PROFITS"  (interest) * "vary exactly as 
the amount of capital; on the contrary, the larger the capital, the larger the 
proportion of the surplus gains to the stock employed" * ([p.] 230). 
In other words, this means nothing more than that the  SALARIES  OF 
MASTERS stand in inverse ratio to the size of the capital. The larger

the scale  on which  the  capital operates,  the  more capitalist  the 
mode  of  production,  the  more negligible  is the  element  of 
industrial PROFIT which  is reducible  to SALARY,  and the  more clearly 
appears  the  real character  of industrial profit, namely, that  it is a 
part of the  SURPLUS GAINS,  i.e. of  SURPLUS  VALUE,  i.e. of  unpaid SURPLUS 
LABOUR. 
The whole contradiction between INDUSTRIAL PROFIT  and  INTEREST 
only has  meaning  as a  contradiction between  the  RENTIER  and the 
INDUSTRIAL  CAPITALIST,  but it has not the slightest bearing on the 
relationship  of the  worker  to capital,  the  nature  of capital,  or the 
origin  of the  profit capital yields,  etc. 
With regard  to rent  not  derived from corn, Ramsay says: 
* "In this manner  the  rent paid  for one  species  of produce becomes  the  cause  of 
the high value  of others" *  ([p.] 279). 
"REVENUE,"  says Ramsay  in the  final chapter, * "differs from  the  annual gross 
produce, simply  by the  absence  of all  those objects which  go to  keep  up fixed 
capital"  * (by  which  he  means constant capital,  RAW  MATERIALS  in all  stages  of 
production, matières instrumentales  and machinery,  etc.) ([p.] 471). 
[XVIII-1102] Ramsay  has  already saida  and  repeats  in the  final 
chapter that 
"CIRCULATING CAPITAL"  (that  is, his  term  for  capital laid  out in  wages)  is 
superfluous,  it is *  "neither  an immediate agent  in production,  nor  even essential  to 
it at all"*  ([p.] 468). 
But he does  not  draw  the  obvious conclusion that  by denying 
that wage labour  and  capital laid  out in  wages  are  essential,  the 
necessity  for  capitalist production  in general  is denied  and the 
conditions  of labour consequently cease  to confront  the  workers  as 
"capital"  or, to use  Ramsay's term,  as "fixed capital".  One  part  of 
the conditions  of labour appears  as fixed capital only because  the 
other part appears  as  CIRCULATING capital.  But  once capitalist 
production  is presupposed  as a  fact, Ramsay declares that WAGES 
and  GROSS  PROFITS  OF CAPITAL  (INDUSTRIAL PROFIT  or, as he  calls  it, PROFIT  OF 
ENTERPRISE, INCLUDED)  are necessary forms  of revenue ([pp.] 478,  475). 
These  are  naturally  the two  forms  of revenue which,  in their 
simplicity  and  generality, indeed epitomise  the  essence  of the 
capitalist production  and of the two  classes  on which  it is  based. 
On the  other hand, Ramsay declares that  RENT,  in other words 
landed property,  is a  superfluous form  of capitalist production 
([p.] 472),  but  forgets that  it is a  necessary product  of this mode  of 
production.  The  same applies  to his  statement that  the  "NET PROFIT 
OF CAPITAL", that  is, interest,  is not a  necessary form.

"It would only  be necessary  for  the rentiers  to become industrial capitalists.  As 
regards  NATIONAL WEALTH  this makes  no  difference...  The  NET3 PROFIT  need 
certainly not be so high  AS  TO  AFFORD SEPARATE INCOMES  TO  THE OWNER AND THE 
EMPLOYER" ([pp.] 476-77). 
Here  he again forgets what  he has said  himself,  namely that,  as 
a necessary consequence  of the  development  of  capital,  a 
constantly growing class  of rentiers comes into being.b 
"GROSS  PROFITS OF CAPITAL AND ENTERPRISE [are]  ... essential  in order that 
production should go on" ([p.] 475). 
Naturally. Without profit,  no  capital  and  without capital,  no 
capitalist production. 
Thus,  the  conclusion  at which Ramsay arrives  is, on the one 
hand, that the capitalist mode  of production based  on wage labour 
is not  really  a necessary,  i.e. not an  absolute form  of social 
production (which Ramsay himself expresses only  in a  rather 
limited form  by  stating that "CIRCULATING CAPITAL"  and  "WAGES" 
[would be] superfluous  if the mass  of the people were not so poor 
that they  had to  receive their share  of the  product IN ADVANCE, 
before  it was completed);  on the  other hand, [he concludes] that 
interest  (in  contrast  to industrial profit) and rent (that is, the form 
of landed property created  by  capitalist production itself)  are 
SUPERFETATIONS which are not essential to capitalist production and of 
which  it can rid  itself.  If this bourgeois ideal were actually 
realisable,  the  only result would  be that the  whole  of the SURPLUS 
VALUE  would  go to the  industrial capitalist directly,  and  society 
would  be  reduced (economically)  to the  simple contradiction 
between capital  and  wage labour,  a simplification which would 
indeed accelerate  the  dissolution  of this mode  of production.

moans:

dealer, and what remained was the profit of the manufacturer, the Lancashire resident, 
the occupier,  on whom the burden  of maintaining the workmen  for so many partakers  in 
the distribution  of the gross produce  is thrown."*0

and the capital laid out in wages, that portion of the product 
which remains constitutes the  SURPLUS  VALUE.  From this however has 
to be deducted a portion for rent and the GAINS of the AGENTS, 
MERCHANTS OR DEALERS, all of whom, WHETHER THEY USe CAPITAL OF THEIR OWN 
OR NOT, also share in that part of the  GROSS  PRODUCE  which constitutes 
SURPLUS  VALUE.  All these therefore are  DEDUCTIONS  for the MANUFACTURER.

working on more fertile soil is more productive than that of a man 
working on less fertile soil. If, therefore, he were to be paid in 
natura, he would receive a smaller share of the  GROSS  PRODUCE than 
the labourer working on less fertile soil. Or, what amounts to the 
same thing, his relative surplus labour would be greater than that 
of the other labourer, although he worked the same number of 
hours per day. But the value of the wage of the one is equal to 
that of the other. Hence the profit of his EMPLOYER is no greater 
[than that of the other employer]. The surplus value contained 
in the additional amount of his product, the greater relative 
productivity of his labour, or the differential surplus labour 
performed  by him, is  POCKETED  BY THE LANDLORD.//

fellow in this group [of economists] since most of what he writes is

pertinent remarks in the form of quotations.169) 
[XVIII-1103] "Capital," says Cherbuliez, consists of "the raw materials, the 
tools,  the means of subsistence [approvisionnement]" (p. 16). "There is no difference 
between a capital and any other part of wealth. A thing only becomes capital by the 
use that is made of it, that is to say, when it is employed in a productive operation, as 
raw material, as instrument, or as means of subsistence" ([p.] 18). a 
This is the standard way of reducing capital to the material 
elements in which it presents itself in the labour process, i.e. 
means of labour and means of subsistence. The latter category, 
moreover, is not accurate since, though means of subsistence are 
indeed a condition for the producer, a prerequisite enabling him 
to exist during production, they themselves do not enter into the 
a Marx quotes in French.— Ed.

286 Theories  of Surplus Value 
labour process, into which nothing enters but the object of labour, 
the means of labour and labour  itself.  Thus the objective factors 
of the labour process—which are common to all forms of 
production—are here called capital, although the approvision­
nement (in which wages are already included) tacitly implies the 
capitalist form of these conditions of labour. 
Cherbuliez, like Ramsay, [assumes] that the approvisionne­
ment —which Ramsay calls CIRCULATING  CAPITAL—diminishes  (rela­
tively, at any rate, to the total amount of capital and absolutely in 
so far as machinery continually throws workers out of employ­
ment).  But both he and Ramsay appear to think that there is an 
inevitable reduction in the amount of means of subsistence, of 
NECESSARIES,  which can be employed as productive capital. But this is 
by no means the case. In this context, people always confuse that 
part of the  GROSS  PRODUCT  which replaces capital and is employed as 
capital, with that part which represents the  SURPLUS  PRODUCE.  The 
approvisionnement decreases because a large portion of 
capital, that is, the part of the  GROSS  PRODUCE  employed as capital, is 
reproduced as constant capital instead of as variable capital. A 
large portion of the SURPLUS PRODUCE, consisting of means of 
subsistence, is consumed by unproductive workers or idlers or 
exchanged for  LUXURIES.  Voilà tout. 3 
True, the fact that a constantly smaller part of the total capital is 
converted into variable capital can also be expressed in other ways. 
The part of capital which consists of variable capital = that part of 
the total product which the worker himself appropriates, produces 
for himself.  Therefore, the smaller this part is the smaller 
accordingly is the portion of the total number of workers which is 
required to reproduce it (just as in the case of the individual 
worker, who works correspondingly less labour time for himself). 
The total product, like the total labour, of the workers falls into 2 
parts.  One part the workers produce for themselves; the other 
part they produce for the capitalist. Just as the [labour] time of the 
individual worker can be divided into 2 parts, so can the [labour] 
time of the whole working class. If the surplus labour='/2 day, it is 
the same as if half the working class produces means of 
subsistence for the working class and the other half produces raw 
materials, machinery and finished products for the capitalists, 
partly as producers and partly as consumers. 
It is ridiculous that Cherbuliez and Ramsay believe that the part

enter into their consumption in natura has been reduced of 
necessity  OR reduced  AT ALL. Only that part has been reduced which 
is consumed in this form and therefore as variable capital On the 
other hand, a larger portion is eaten up by servants, soldiers, etc., 
or exported and exchanged for more sumptuous means of 
subsistence. 
The only important thing in both Ramsay and Cherbuliez is that 
they actually counterpose variable and constant capital and do not 
confine themselves to the distinction between fixed and circulating 
capital derived from circulation. For Cherbuliez counterposes that 
part of capital which goes on approvisionnement to that which 
consists of matières brutes, matières instrumentales 11 and means of 
labour, i.e. INSTRUMENTS, MACHINES. Although two constituent elements 
of constant capital— matières brutes and instrumentales —belong to 
circulating capital as far as the mode of circulation is concerned. 
The important thing in variations in the constituent elements of 
capital is not that relatively more workers are occupied in the 
production of raw materials and machinery than in that of direct 
means of subsistence—this concerns only the division of labour— 
but the proportion of the product which has to be used to replace 
past labour (i.e. to replace constant capital) to that which has to be 
used to pay living labour. The larger the scale of capitalist 
production, and hence the greater the accumulation of capital— 
the greater is the share in the value of the product falling to the 
machinery and raw material into which the CAPITAL  EMPLOYED  in the 
production of machinery and raw material can be resolved. A cor­
respondingly larger portion of the product must therefore be 
returned to production either in natura or by the producers of con­
stant capital exchanging some of their products amongst themselves. 
The part of the product which belongs to production becomes 
larger, and the part which represents living, newly added labour 
becomes relatively smaller. Of course, this part grows in 
terms of commodities—use values, since the development de­
scribed is synonymous with increased productivity of labour. But the 
portion of this part which the worker receives falls relatively all the 
more. And the same process gives rise to a continuous relative REDUN­
DANCY of the WORKING POPULATION. 
[XVIII-1104] //It is an incontrovertible  FACT  that, as capitalist 
production develops, the portion of capital invested in machinery 
and raw materials grows, and the portion laid out in wages 
declines. This is the only question with which both Ramsay and

Cherbuliez are concerned. For us, however, the main thing is: 
does this FACT explain the decline in the rate of profit? (A decline, 
incidentally, which is far smaller than it is said to be.) Here it is 
not simply a question of the quantitative ratio but of the value 
ratio. 
If 1 worker can spin as much cotton as 100 [workers spun 
previously],  then the [supply of] raw material must be increased a 
hundredfold, and this is moreover brought about only by the 
spinning machine which enables one worker to control 100 
spindles. But if simultaneously one worker produces as much 
cotton as 100 workers did previously and 1 worker produces a 
spinning machine whereas previously he produced only a spindle, 
then the ratio of value remains the same, that is, the labour 
expended in the spinning, [in the production of] the cotton and 
the spinning machine remains the same as that expended 
previously in spinning, the cotton and the spindle. 
As far as the machinery is concerned, its cost is not as great as 
that of the labour it displaces, although the spinning machine is 
much more expensive than the spindle. The individual capitalist 
who owns a spinning machine must possess a greater amount of 
capital than the individual spinner who buys a spinning wheel. But 
the spinning machine is cheaper than the spinning wheel in 
relation to the number of workers it employs. Otherwise it would 
not have displaced the spinning wheel. The place of the spinner is 
taken by a capitalist. But the capital which the former laid out on 
the spinning wheel was larger relative to the size of the product, 
than that which the capitalist lays out on the spinning ma­
chine.//3 
The increasing productivity of labour (in so  FAR  AS [it is] CONNECTED 
WITH MACHINERY) is identical with the decreasing number of workers 
* relatively to the number and extent of the machinery employed. 
Instead of a simple and cheap instrument a collection of those 
instruments  * (albeit MODIFIED) IS put in place, and  * besides that col­
lection the whole part of the machinery consisting of the moving 
and conducting parts; besides the materials used (like coal, etc.) 
to produce the moving agent (as steam).* Finally, the buildings. If 
one worker is in charge of 1,800 spindles instead of driving a 
spinning wheel, it would be quite ridiculous to ask why these 1,800 
spindles are not as cheap as the single spinning wheel. The 
productivity in this case is brought about precisely by the amount 
of capital employed as machinery. The ratio of the wear and tear

of the machinery affects only the commodity; the worker 
confronts the total amount of machinery and similarly the value of 
the capital laid out in labour confronts the value of the capital laid 
out in machinery. 
There can be no doubt that machinery becomes cheaper, and 
this for two reasons: [1] The application of machinery to the 
production of raw materials from which the machinery is made. 
[2] The application of machinery in the transformation of these 
materials into machinery. In saying this, we already say two things. 
Firstly, that in both these branches, compared with the instruments 
required in the manufacturing industry, the value of the capital 
laid out in machinery also grows as compared with that laid out in 
wages. Secondly, what becomes cheaper is the individual machine 
and its component parts, but a system of machinery develops; the 
tool is not simply replaced by a single machine, but by a whole 
system, and the tools which perhaps played the major part 
previously, the needle for example (in the case of a stocking loom 
or a similar machine), are now assembled in thousands. Each 
individual machine confronting the worker is in itself a colossal 
assembly of instruments which he formerly used singly, e.g. 1,800 
spindles instead of one. But in addition, the machine contains 
elements which the old instrument did not have, etc. Despite the 
cheapening of individual elements, the price of the  WHOLE 
aggregate increases enormously and the [increase in] productivity 
consists in the continuous expansion of the machinery. Further, 
one factor in the cheapening of machinery apart from that of its 
elements, is the cheapening of the source of the motive power (the 
steam-boiler, for example) and of the transmission mechanism. 
ECONOMY  OF POWER. But this results precisely from the fact that to an 
increasing extent the same motor can drive a larger system of 
machines. The motor becomes relatively cheaper (or its cost does 
not grow in the same ratio as the increase in the size of the system 
in which it is employed; the motor becomes more expensive as its 
power grows, but not in the same proportion); even when its cost 
increases absolutely, it declines relatively. This is therefore a new 
motive, quite apart from the price of the individual machine, for 
increasing the capital that is laid out in machinery and confronts 
labour. One element—the increasing speed of machinery— 
increases productive power enormously but it does not affect the 
value of the machinery itself in any way. 
It is therefore self-evident or a tautological proposition that the 
increasing productivity of labour caused by machinery corresponds 
to increased value of the machinery relative to the amount of 

=====第300页=====

labour employed (consequently to the value of labour, the variable 
capital). 
[XVIII-1105] All circumstances which result in the use of 
machinery leading to a reduction in the price of commodities can 
be attributed, firstly, to a decrease in the amount of labour 
embodied in each individual commodity, secondly, however, to a 
decrease in the wear and tear of the machinery whose value enters 
into the individual commodity. The less rapid the wear and tear of 
the machinery, the less labour is required for its reproduction. 
This therefore increases the amount and the value of the capital 
existing as machinery as compared with that existing in labour. 
Only the question of raw material therefore remains to be dealt 
with. It is obvious that the quantity of raw material must increase 
proportionally with the productivity of labour; that is, the amount 
of raw material must be proportionate to that of labour. This 
relationship is closer than it appears. Let us assume, for example, 
that 10,000 lbs of cotton are consumed weekly. Calculating 50 
weeks to the year, this would amount to 10,000x50, that is, 
500,000 lbs. Let us also assume that the amount paid out in 
wages=£5,000 over the year. And if a pound of cotton is assumed 
to cost 6d. this comes to 250,000s. =£12,500. Let us assume that 
the capital turns over 5 times during the year. This means that in 
the course of a fifth of a year, 100,000 lbs of cotton is used=£2,500. 
And £1,000 goes on wages in the same fifth of a 
year. This is more than V3 of the value of the capital laid out on 
the cotton.170 This does not alter the ratio. If the value of the 
cotton =  [£] 10,000 every Vs of a year and that of the labour =1,000, 
then it will be Vio- (If one considers the product of the whole year, 
50,000 on one side and  5,000  on the other—it is also V10-) 
//The value of a commodity, quoad machinery,3 is determined by 
the wear and tear of the machinery, that is, solely by the value of 
the machinery in so far as it enters into the valorisation process, in 
other words, in so far as it is used up in the labour process. Profit, 
on the contrary, is determined (leaving raw materials out of 
account) by the value of the whole of the machinery which enters 
into the labour process irrespective of the degree to which it is 
used up. Profit must therefore decline as the total amount of 
[living] labour employed declines compared with the part of 
capital laid out in machinery. It does not decline in the same 
proportion because surplus labour increases.// 
One may ask with regard to raw material: If, for example, 
a As far as machinery is concerned.— Ed.

productive power in spinning increases tenfold, that is, 1 worker 
spins as much as ten did previously, why should not 1 NIGGER3 
produce as much cotton as 10 did previously, that is, why should 
the value ratio not remain the same? The spinner uses 10 times as 
much cotton in the same time, but the NIGGER produces 10 times as 
much cotton in the same time. The 10 times larger amount of 
cotton therefore costs no more than a tenth of this amount cost 
previously. This means that despite the increase in the amount of 
the raw material, its value ratio to variable capital remains the 
same. In fact it was only the large fall in the price of cotton which 
enabled the cotton industry to develop in the way it did. The 
dearer the material (gold and silver, for example) the less are 
machinery and the division of labour applied in transforming it 
into articles of luxury. This is because too much capital has been 
advanced for the raw materials and the demand for these 
products is limited owing to the expensive raw materials. 
To this it is quite easy to answer that some kinds of raw 
materials, such as wool, silk, leather, are produced by animal 
organic processes, while cotton, linen, etc., are produced by 
vegetable organic processes; capitalist production has not yet 
succeeded, and never will succeed in mastering these processes in 
the same way as it has mastered purely mechanical or inorganic 
chemical processes. Raw materials such as skins, etc., and other 
animal products become dearer partly because the insipid law of 
rent increases the value of these products as civilisation advances. 
As far as coal and metal (wood) are concerned, they become much 
cheaper with the advance of production; this will however become 
more difficult as mines are exhausted, etc. 
//While it can be said with regard to corn rent and mine rent 
that they do not increase the value of the product (only its market

(the excess of its value over the production price), there is, on the 
other hand, no doubt that animal rent, house rent, etc., are not 
consequences but causes of the increasing values of these things. 
The cheapening of raw materials, and of matières instrumentales, 
etc.,  CHECKS BUT DOES NOT CANCEL THE GROWING VALUE OF THIS PART OF CAPITAL. It 
checks it TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT brings about THE FALL in PROFIT.//

292 Theories of Surplus Value 
//In considering profit, surplus value is assumed as given. And 
only the variations in constant capital and their influence on the 
rate of profit are considered. There is only one way in which 
surplus value directly affects constant capital, namely through 
absolute surplus labour, lengthening of the working day, as a result 
of which the relative value of constant capital is reduced. Relative 
SURPLUS LABOUR—where the working day remains unaltered (apart 
from the greater intensification of labour)—increases the value 
ratio of profit to total capital by increasing the SURPLUS  itself. 
Absolute surplus labour time reduces the cost of constant capital 
RELATIVELY.// 
[XVIII-1106] Let us return to Cherbuliez. 
The formulas he uses for the rate of profit are either 
mathematical expressions for profit as it is COMMONLY understood, 
without involving any kind of law, or they are quite wrong, 
although he has an inkling of the matter, approaches close to it. 
"Commercial profit is determined by the value of the products compared with 
the different elements of productive capital." 
//In point of fact, profit is the relationship of the  SURPLUS  VALUE  of 
the product to the value of the total capital advanced regardless of 
the differences in its elements. But the SURPLUS VALUE is itself 
determined by the size of the variable capital and the rate of its 
valorisation, and the ratio of this  SURPLUS  VALUE  to the total capital is 
again determined by the ratio of the variable to the constant 
capital and also by changes in the value of constant capital.// 
"Evidently the two chief elements in this determination are the price of the raw 
materials and amount of approvisionnement required to work them up. The 
economic progress of society affects these two elements in an opposite way and it 
tends to make raw materials dearer by increasing the value of all the products of 
the extractive industries, 172 which are carried out on land that is privately owned 
and limited in extent" (p. 70).a  On the other hand, the approvisionnement decreases 
(relatively), a matter to which we shall return presently. 
"The total amount of products, less the total amount of capital expended in 
producing them, provides us with the total amount of profit gained during a 
definite period of time. The growth in the total amount of products is proportionate 
to the capital advanced and not to the capital consumed. The rate of profit, or the 
ratio of profit to capital, is therefore the result of the combination of two other 
ratios,  namely, the ratio between the capital advanced and that consumed, and the ratio 
between the capital consumed and the product" (I.e., [p.] 70). 
Cherbuliez first states correctly that profit is determined by the 
value of the product in relation to the "different elements" of 
productive capital. Then he flies off suddenly to the product  itself, 
Marx quotes partly in German and partly in French.— Ed. 

=====第303页=====
Cherbuliez 293 
to the total amount of products. But the amount of products may 
increase without its value increasing. Secondly, a comparison 
between the amount of the product and the quantity of products 
of which the capital—used up and not used up—consisted, can at 
best only be made in the way Ramsay does, by comparing the 
aggregate natural product with the ingredients expended in 
natura.* But as regards capital, the form taken by the product is 
different from its ingredients in every particular sphere of 
production (even in those branches of industry in which, as in 
agriculture, etc., one part of the product is used in natura as a 
production element of the product). Why does Cherbuliez stray on 
to this faux fuyant ? Because, despite his vague idea that the 
organic composition of capital is decisive for the rate of profit, he 
in no way uses the contradiction between variable capital and the 
other part of capital in order to explain  SURPLUS  VALUE—which,  like 
value  itself,  he does not explain at all. He has not shown how 
SURPLUS  VALUE  arises and therefore has recourse to SURPLUS  PRODUCE,  i.e. 
to use value. 
Although all  SURPLUS  VALUE  takes the form of  SURPLUS  PRODUCE,  SURPLUS 
PRODUCE  as such does not represent  SURPLUS  VALUE.  //A product may 
contain no  SURPLUS  VALUE,  as, for example, in the case of a peasant 
who owns his own implements (as well as his own land) and only 
works exactly the same amount of time as any wage worker does 
to reproduce his own wages, say 6 hours. In a good year, he might 
produce twice as much [as usual]. But the value would remain the 
same. THERE  WOULD  BE NO SURPLUS  VALUE,  although [there would be] 
SURPLUS  PRODUCE.// 
In itself it was already a mistake on the part of Cherbuliez to 
represent variable capital in the "passive" and purely material 
form of approvisionnement, that is, as use value, a form which it 
obtains in the hands of the workers. If, on the other hand, he had 
considered it in the form in which it actually appears, namely, as 
money (as the form in which exchange value, i.e. a certain amount 
of social labour time as such, exists), then for the capitalist it would 
resolve in the labour which he exchanges for it (and, as a result of 
this exchange of objectified labour for living labour, the variable 
capital would be set in motion and would grow); variable capital in 
the shape of labour—but not if it is regarded as approvisionne­
ment —becomes an element of productive capital. Approvisionne­
ment, on the other hand, is the use value, the material existence of

the variable capital when  it becomes  the  revenue  of the  worker. 
Variable capital regarded  as approvisionnement  is, therefore, 
just as "passive"  an  element  as both  the  other parts  of capital 
which Cherbuliez describes  as "passive". 
The same distortion  of views prevents  him  from elaborating  the 
rate of profit  out of the  relationship  of this active element  to the 
passive element,  and  from showing that  it declines  as society 
advances. Cherbuliez  in fact reaches  no other conclusion  but  that 
the approvisionnement [XVIII-1107] declines  as a  consequence  of 
the development  of the  productive power while  the  working 
population grows,  and so, as a  result  of the  REDUNDANT POPULATION, 
wages  are  consequently pushed down below their value. None  of 
his explanations  are  based  on the  exchange  of [equal] values—or 
the payment  of labour capacity  at its  value—and profit thus 
actually appears  to be a  deduction from wages (although  he doesn't 
say so).  This deduction  may  indeed occasionally constitute  a part 
of real profits,  but it can  never serve  as the  foundation  for the 
elaboration  of the  category  of profit. 
Let us  d'abord reduce  the  first proposition  to its  correct 
formulation. 
"The value  of the  total amount  of products, less  the  value  of the  total amount 
of capital expended  in producing them, provides  us with  the  total amount  of profit 
gained during  a definite period  of time."173 
This is the  primary (usual) form  in which profit appears  and it 
is likewise  the  form  in which  it appears  in the  consciousness  of 
capitalists. Alias [profit  is] the  excess  of the  value  of the  product 
gained during  a definite period  of time over  the  value  of the 
capital expended.  Or the  excess  of the  value  of the  product over 
the cost price  of the  product. Even  "the  definite period  of time" 
in Cherbuliez's statement appears like  a bolt from  the  blue, since 
he has not  dealt with  the  circulation process  of capital.  The  first 
proposition, therefore,  is nothing  but the  usual DEFINITION  OF PROFIT, 
of the  immediate form  in which  it appears. 
The second proposition: 
"The growth  in the  total amount  of products  is proportionate  to the  capital 
employed  and not to the  capital used  up." 
Paraphrased again,  it would read thus: 
"The growth  in the  value  of the  total amount  of products  is proportionate  to the 
capital advanced"  (WHETHER CONSUMED  OR  NOT). 
The only purpose  of this  is the  surreptitious introduction  of the 
completely unproven  and, in the way it is  formulated, quite false 
proposition  (for it  already presupposes equalisation  to the  general 

=====第305页=====
Cherbuliez 295 
rate of profit) that the amount of profit depends on the amount 
of capital employed. But an apparent causal nexus is to be 
introduced because "the growth in the total amount of products is 
proportionate to the capital employed and not to the capital used 
UP"-
Let us take this sentence in both its formulations—that in which 
it is written and that in which it ought to have been written. In 
this context—and in accordance with the conclusion which it is 
intended to serve as médius terminus*—it should be written as 
follows: 
"The growth in the value of the total amount of products is proportionate to the 
capital employed and not to the capital used up." 
Here, evidently, SURPLUS value is to be evolved on the basis of the 
fact that the excess of the capital employed over that used up 
creates the excess value of the products. But the capital which is not 
used up (machinery, etc.) retains its value (for the fact that it is not 
used up means precisely that its value has not been used up); it 
retains the same value after the conclusion of the production 
process as it had before this process started. If any change in value 
has taken place, it can only have happened in that part of the 
capital which has been used up, and which therefore entered into 
the valorisation process. In point of fact it is also wrong to say 
that, for example, a capital of which Vs is not used up and 2/3 are 
used up in production, would inevitably yield a higher profit than 
one in which 2/s are not used up and /3 is used up, provided the 
rate of the exploitation of labour is the same (and disregarding the 
equalisation of the rate of profit). For obviously, the second capital 
contains more machinery, etc., and other elements of constant 
capital, while the first capital contains less of these elements and 
sets more living labour in motion, and therefore produces more 
surplus labour as well. 
If we take the proposition as formulated by Cherbuliez  himself, 
then it must be said d'abord that it is of no use to him, because the 
amount of products or the amount of use values as such by no 
means determines either the value or the surplus value or the 
profit. But what is behind all this? A part of constant capital 
consisting of machinery, etc., enters into the labour process 
without entering into the valorisation process, and thereby helps to 
increase the amount of products without adding anything to their 
value. (For in so far as its wear and tear adds value to the product, 
it belongs to the capital used up and not to the capital employed as 
a Intermediate clause. Here, a second proposition.— Ed. 
20* 

=====第306页=====
296 Theories of Surplus Value 
opposed to that used up.) But, by  itself,  this unconsumed part of 
constant capital does not bring about a growth in the amount of 
products. It helps to produce a greater output in a given labour 
time.  Therefore, if only the same amount of labour time were 
expended as is contained in the approvisionnement, the same 
amount of products would be produced. The excess of products is 
therefore due to a CHANGE which takes place in this part of the 
capital used up and not to the excess of the capital employed over 
that used up (assuming that it is not a matter of branches of 
industry in which —  as in agriculture—the amount of products is, 
or can be, independent of the amount of capital laid out, [because] 
the productivity of labour is, in part, dependent on uncontrollable 
natural conditions). 
If however he considers constant capital—used up or other­
wise—  as independent of the labour time, independent of the 
CHANGE in the variable capital which takes place in the valorisation 
process, then he might just as well say: 
"The growth in the total amount [XVIII-1108] of products" (at least in the 
manufacturing industry) "is proportionate to the growth of the part of capital 
consisting of raw materials which is used up." 
For the increase of products is physically identical with the 
growth of this part of capital. In agriculture on the other hand 
(and likewise in the extractive industries), where only a small 
proportion of the capital laid out is not used up (i.e. constant 
capital) and a relatively large proportion of capital is used up (as 
wages for example), the amount of products, provided the land is 
fairly fertile, can be much larger than in the advanced countries 
where the ratio of capital laid out to capital used up is infinitely 
greater. The second proposition thus amounts to an attempt to 
bring in surreptitiously SURPLUS VALUE (the indispensable basis of 
profit). 
"The rate of profit, or the ratio of the profit to capital, is therefore the result of 
the combination of two other ratios, namely, the ratio between the capital advanced 
and that used up, and the ratio between the capital used up and the product" (p. 70). 
Previously profit ought to have been explained. But nothing 
emerged except a DEFINITION of it which merely states the form in 
which it appears, i.e. the fact that profit=the excess of the value of 
the total product over the cost price of the product or over the 
value of the capital used up, which is the VULGAR DEFINITION  OF PROFIT. 
Now the rate of profit ought to be explained. But once again 
nothing emerges except the VULGAR DEFINITION. The rate of 
profit=the ratio of profit to the total capital, or, what amounts to 
the same thing, it=the ratio of the excess of the value of the 

=====第307页=====
Cherbuliez 297 
product over its cost price to the total capital advanced for 
production. The distorted conception and bungling application of 
the approximately correct distinction between the elements of 
capital, and the vague idea that profit and rate of profit are 
directly connected with the ratio of these elements to one another, 
only lead to a repetition of the generally known phrases in a 
rather doctrinaire fashion, in fact merely to a statement that profit 
and rate of profit exist, without, however, anything being said 
about their nature. The matter is not improved by the fact that 
Cherbuliez expresses his doctrinaire formulae in algebraic lan­
guage: 
"Let P be the aggregate product of a given period of time, C the capital 
invested, IT the profit, r the ratio of profit to capital (rate), c the capital used up, 
it 
then  P—C=IT,  r = —, therefore  CT=TT.  Therefore P—c  = Cr; therefore 
P-c 
r = -^-" ([p.] 70, Note 1). 
Which means nothing more than that the rate of profit=the 
ratio of profit to capital and that profit=the excess of the value of 
the product over its cost price. 
In general, when Cherbuliez speaks about consumed and 
unconsumed capital he has at the back of his mind the difference 
between fixed and circulating capital, and not the distinction 
which he himself has drawn, namely, that between the different 
types of capital based on the production process. Surplus value is 
antecedent to circulation and no matter how much the differences 
arising out of circulation affect the rate of profit, they have 
nothing to do with the origin of profit. 
"Productive capital is composed of a consumable part and a non-consumable 
part. The more wealth and population increase, the more the consumable part tends 
to increase, because the extractive  INDUSTRIES  demand an ever greater supply of 
labour. On the other hand, this same progress causes the amount of capital 
advanced to increase at a much faster rate than the amount of capital consumed. 
Thus although the total mass of capital consumed tends to increase, the effect is 
neutralised, because the mass of products grows in more rapid progression and the 
total amount of profit must be considered as growing at a rate at least as high as that 
at which the total amount of capital advanced grows" ([p.] 71).a "The amount of 
profit grows, not the rate, which is the ratio of this amount to the capital advanced, 
!•'-<•' r = . It is clear that P—c or the profit, since P—c=it, can grow although r 
declines, if C grows more rapidly than P—c" ([p.] 71, Note 1). 
a Marx quotes partly in German and partly in French.— Ed.

298 Theories of Surplus Value 
Here the reason for the decline in the rate of profit is touched 
on, but in view of the preceding distortions, it can only lead to 
confusion and contradictions which cancel each other out. First the 
amount of capital consumed grows but the amount of products 
grows even more rapidly (i.e. the excess of the value of the 
products over their cost price in this case), for it grows in 
proportion to the capital advanced and this grows more rapidly 
than the capital consumed. Why the fixed capital grows more 
rapidly than the mass of raw materials, for example, is not 
explained anywhere.  BUT  NEVER  MIND.  The amount of profit grows in 
proportion to the capital advanced, to the total capital, but 
[XVIII-1109] the rate of profit is nevertheless supposed to fall, 
because the total capital grows more rapidly than the mass of 
products or rather than the amount of profit. First the amount of 
profit grows at a rate at least as great as that at which "the total 
amount of capital advanced" grows, and then the rate of profit 
falls, because the total amount of capital advanced grows more 
rapidly than the amount of profit. First P—c grows "at least" 
P—c proportionally to C, and then falls, because C increases 
even more rapidly than P—c, which "increases at least as rapidly as 
C". If we throw aside all this confusion, then all that remains is the 
?-c tautology that can fall although P—c increases, that is, 
that the rate of profit can fall although profit increases when the 
rate falls. The rate of profit simply signifies the ratio of P—c to C, 
[and this ratio declines] when capital increases more rapidly than 
the amount of profit. 
Thus the final pearl of wisdom is that the rate of profit can fall, 
that is, the ratio of an increasing amount of profit to capital can 
fall when the capital increases more rapidly than the amount of 
profit, or if the amount of profit, despite the absolute growth, 
declines relatively in comparison with the capital. This is nothing 
but a different expression for the decline in the rate of profit. But 
that this phenomenon is within the bounds of possibility, and even 
its existence, has never been called to question. The sole point at 
issue was precisely to explain the cause of this phenomenon, and 
Cherbuliez explains the decline in the rate of profit, the decline in 
the amount of profit in relation to the total capital, by the relative 
increase in the amount of profit which is at least proportionate to 
the growth of the capital. He obviously surmises that the mass of 
living labour employed declines relatively to past labour, although 

=====第309页=====
Cherbuliez 299 
it increases absolutely, and that therefore the rate of profit must 
decline. But he never arrives at a clear understanding. The closer 
one comes to the threshold of understanding, the more distorted 
the statements become, unless the threshold is actually crossed, 
and [the greater is] the illusion of having crossed it. 
On the other hand, what he says about the equalisation of the 
general rate of profit is very much to the point. 
//In the second chapter of Part III, on "Capital and Profit", 
where the formation of the general rate of profit is dealt with, the 
following must be considered: 
1) Different organic composition of capitals, partly conditioned by 
the difference between variable and constant capital in so far as 
this arises from the stage of production—the absolute quantitative 
relations between machinery, raw materials and the quantity of 
labour which sets them in motion. These differences relate to the 
labour process. The differences between fixed and circulating 
capital arising from the circulation process have also to be 
considered—differences which lead to valorisation variations, in a 
given period of time, in different spheres. 
2) Differences in the relative value of the parts of different capitals 
which do not arise from their organic composition. These arise 
from the difference of  VALUE  particularly of the raw materials, even 
assuming that the raw materials absorb an equal quantity of labour 
in two different spheres. 
3) The result of those differences is diversity of the rates of profit 
in different spheres of capitalist production. It is true only for 
capitals of equal composition, etc., that the rate of profit is the 
same and the amount of profit is in proportion to the size of the 
capital employed. 
4) For the total capital, however, what has been explained in 
CHAPTER I holds good. In capitalist production each capital is 
assumed to be a unit, an aliquot part of the total capital. Formation 
of the general rate of profit. (Competition.) 
5) Transformation of values into prices of production. Difference 
between value, cost price, and production price.// 
//6) To take up also the Ricardian point: The influence of 
general variations in wages on the general rate of profit and HENCE 
on prices of production.// 
"After the deduction of rent, what remains of the amount of profit, that is, of the 
excess of products over the capital consumed, is divided between the capitalist 
producers in proportion to the capital each has advanced, whereas the portion of the 
product which corresponds to the capital consumed and is intended to replace it, is 
divided in proportion with the capital actually used up. This dual law of division 

=====第310页=====
300 Theories of Surplus Value 
comes about as a result of competition, which tends to equalise the advantages of all 
investments of capital. Finally, this dual law of division determines the respective 
values and prices of the different kinds of products" ([pp.] 71-72). 
This is very good. Only the concluding words are wrong, 
namely, that the formation of the general rate of profit 
determines the values and prices (it should be prices of produc­
tion) of commodities. On the contrary, the determination of the 
value is the prius,* antecedent to the rate of profit and to the 
establishment of production prices. How can any division at all 
of the "amount of profit", i.e. of the surplus value [XVIII-
1110]—which is itself only a part of the total value of com­
modities—determine the "amount of profit", that is, the surplus 
value, that is, the value of the commodities? This is only correct if, 
by relative values of commodities, one means their production 
prices. The whole lopsidedness of Cherbuliez's presentation arises 
from the fact that he does not examine the origin and the laws of 
value and surplus value independently. In other respects, he 
describes the relation between wage labour and capital more or 
less correctly. 
"People who neither receive anything by devolution" (legal transfer, inher­
itance, etc.), "nor have any possessions they can exchange, can obtain what they 
need only by offering their labour to the capitalist. They only acquire the right to 
the things which are allocated to them as the price of  labour,  but they have no right 
to the product of their labour, nor to the value which they have added" 
([pp.] 55-56). "By exchanging his labour for a certain volume of approvisionnement, 
the worker completely renounces all right to the other portions of capital. The 
attribution of these products remains the same as it was previously; it is not 
modified in any way by the above-mentioned convention. The products continue to 
belong exclusively to the capitalist who has provided the raw materials and the 
approvisionnement. This is an inescapable sequence of the law of appropriation, the 
fundamental principle of which was, conversely, the exclusive right of  every  worker to the 
product of this labour" (p. 58). 
This fundamental principle, according to Cherbuliez, is as 
follows: 
"The worker has an exclusive right to the value resulting from his labour" 
(p. 48)> 
Cherbuliez does not understand nor does he explain how the 
law of commodities, according to which commodities are equiva­
lents and exchange with one another in proportion to their value, 
i.e. to the labour time embodied in them, unexpectedly leads to 
the result that on the contrary capitalist production—and only on 
the basis of capitalist production is it essential for the product to 
a Primary factor.—Ed. 
b Marx quotes in French.—Ed. 

=====第311页=====
Cherbuliez 301 
be produced as a commodity—depends on the fact that one 
portion of labour is appropriated without exchange. He only 
senses that a transformation has suddenly taken place. 
This fundamental principle is a pure fiction. It arises from the 
surface appearance of commodity circulation. Commodities are 
exchanged with one another according to their value, that is, 
according to the labour embodied in them. Individuals confront 
one another only as commodity owners and can therefore only 
acquire other individuals' commodities by alienating their own. It 
therefore appears as if they exchanged only their own labour since 
the exchange of commodities which contain other  people's  labour, in 
so far as they themselves were not acquired by the individuals 
in exchange for their own commodities, presupposes different 
relations between people than those of [simple] commodity 
owners, of buyers and of sellers. In capitalist production this 
appearance, which its surface displays, disappears. What does not 
disappear, however, is the illusion that originally men confront 
one another only as commodity owners and that, consequently, a 
person is only a property owner in so far as he is a worker. As has 
been stated, this "originally" is a delusion arising from the surface 
appearance of capitalist production and has never existed histori­
cally. In general, man (isolated or social) always comes on to the 
stage as a property owner before he appears as a worker, even if 
the property is only what he procures for himself from inorganic 
nature (or what he as a member of the family, tribe, communal 
organisation, procures partly from nature, partly from the means 
of production which have already been produced in common). 
And as soon as the first animal state is left behind, man's property 
in nature is mediated by his existence as a member of a communal 
body, family, tribe, etc., by his relationship to other men, which 
determines his relationship to nature. The "propertyless labourer" 
as a "fundamental principle" is rather a creature of civilisation 
and, on the historical scale, of "capitalist production". This is a 
law of "expropriation" not of "appropriation", at least not simply 
of appropriation in the way Cherbuliez imagines it, but a kind of 
appropriation which corresponds to a definite, specific mode of 
production. 
"Every accumulation of wealth provides the means for accelerating further 
accumulation" ([p.] 29).a 
On page 59, Cherbuliez calls matières brutes and machinery, etc., 
"the two passive elements of capital " in contrast to the approvisionne­
ment.

302 Theories of Surplus Value 
//Ricardo's view (derived from Smith) that all accumulation can 
be reduced to expenditure on wages, would be incorrect even if 
no accumulation in natura took place—[which is the case,] for 
example, when the FARMER SOWS more seed, the stock-breeder 
increases his stock of cattle for breeding or for fattening, the 
owner of engineering works uses part of his surplus value in the 
form of machine tools—and even if all producers who produce 
the elements of some part of capital did not overproduce 
regularly, counting on the fact of annual accumulation, i.e. the 
expansion of the general scale of production. Moreover, the 
farmer can exchange part of his SURPLUS corn with the stock­
breeder, who may convert this corn into variable capital while the 
farmer converts his corn into constant capital [by means of this 
exchange].  The flax-grower [XVIII-1111] sells part of his surplus 
product to the spinner, who converts it into constant capital. With 
this money the flax-grower can buy tools and the tool-maker can 
buy iron, etc., so that all these elements are turned directly into 
constant capital. 
But disregarding all this, let us assume that a manufacturer of 
machines wants to convert AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OF £1,000 into 
elements of production. He will of course lay out part of it on 
wages, say £200. But he buys iron, coal, etc., with the remaining 
800. Let us assume that this iron, coal, etc., has first to be 
produced. Then, if the iron or coal producers either have no 
excess (accumulated) stocks of their commodities, and likewise 
have no ADDITIONAL MACHINERY and are unable to buy it immediately 
(for in this case too constant capital would be exchanged for 
constant capital), they can only [produce the required iron and 
coal] if they work their old MACHINERY longer. As a result, they 
would have to replace it more rapidly, but a part of its value 
would enter into the new product. Irrespective of this, however, 
the iron manufacturer needs more coal in any case and must 
therefore transform at least part of his share in the £800 directly 
into constant capital. Both coal and iron producers sell their wares 
in such a way that they contain unpaid surplus labour. And if this 
amounts to a YU, then this alone means that 200 out of the £800 is 
not converted into wages, not to mention the part which has to 
make good the wear and tear of the old machinery. 
The SURPLUS consists always of the articles produced by the 
particular capital, i.e. coal, iron, etc. Part of the SURPLUS is converted 
directly into constant capital when the producers whose com­
modities serve as elements of production for other producers 
exchange these commodities with one another. That part [of the 

=====第313页=====
Cherbuliez 303 
surplus value], however, which is exchanged against the products 
of those who produce means of subsistence and replaces their 
constant capital, provides the necessary variable capital. The 
producers of means of subsistence that can no longer enter as 
elements into their production (except as variable capital) acquire 
additional constant capital through the same process which 
provides the other [producers] with additional variable capital. 
The following features distinguish reproduction—in so far as it 
constitutes accumulation—from simple reproduction. 
Firstly: Both the constant and variable elements of production 
which are accumulated consist of newly added labour. They do 
not amount to revenue, although they arise from profit. They 
amount to profit or surplus labour, whereas in the case of simple 
reproduction part of the product represents past labour (i.e. in this 
context, labour which has not been performed in the current year). 
Secondly: If the labour time in certain branches is lengthened, 
that is, if no ADDITIONAL INSTRUMENTS or machines are employed, the 
new product must indeed, to a certain extent, pay for the more 
rapid wear and tear of the old [tools or machines], and this 
accelerated consumption of the old constant capital is likewise an 
aspect of accumulation. 
As a result of the ADDITIONAL money capital which arises in the 
process of reproduction—partly through the freeing of capital, 
partly through the conversion of part of the product into money, 
partly because, as a result of the money collected by the producer, 
the demand for other [commodities], e.g., [those offered by the] 
sellers of luxury goods, is reduced—the systematic replacement of 
the elements [of production] is by no means a necessity, as it is in 
the case of simple reproduction. With the ADDITIONAL money anyone 
can buy or command products, although the producer from whom 
the purchase is made may neither expend his revenue on the 
product of the purchaser nor replace his capital with it.// 
//ADDITIONAL CAPITAL (constant or variable) must appear in the form 
of money capital on one side, even if this only exists in the form 
of outstanding claims, whenever it is not balanced by a corres­
ponding addition on the other side.// 
For the rest, Cherbuliez presents a remarkable amalgam of 
Sismondian and Ricardian contradictory views. 
Cherbuliez says: 
"The products are appropriated before they are converted into capital; and this 
conversion does not eliminate such appropriation" ([p.] 54).a 
a Marx quotes partly in German and partly in French.— Ed.

304 Theories of Surplus Value 
But this applies not only to the products, but also to labour. Raw 
materials, etc., and means of labour belong to the capitalist. They 
are the converted form of his money. On the other hand, when he 
has bought labour capacity or the daily (say 12 hours) USE of 
labour capacity, with a sum of money=the product of 6 hours of 
labour, then the labour of 12 hours belongs to him; it is 
appropriated by him before it is carried out. The process of 
production itself turns labour into capital. But this transformation 
is an act which takes place later than its appropriation. The 
"products" are converted into capital, physically converted in so far 
as in the labour process they function as conditions of labour, 
conditions of production, objects and means of labour, and 
formally converted in so far as not only their value COMES TO BE 
PERPETUATED but as they become means for absorbing labour and 
surplus labour, in so far as they  IN FACT  function as  ABSORBERS  or LABOUR. 
[XVIII-1112] On the other hand: the labour capacity appropriated 
before the [production] process is turned directly into capital in the 
course of the process by being converted into the conditions of 
labour and into  SURPLUS  VALUE;  as a result of its embodiment in the 
product, it not only preserves the constant capital but replaces the 
variable capital and adds SURPLUS VALUE. 
Sismondian: 
"The hypothesis that an invariable ratio exists between the different elements of 
capital is not substantiated at any stage of the economic development of society. 
The relationship is essentially variable and for two reasons: a) the division of 
labour, and b) the replacement of human labour by natural agents" ([p.] 61). 
"These two factors tend to reduce the ratio of the approvisionnement to the other 
two elements of capital" ([pp.] 61-62). 
"In this situation, the increase in productive capital does not necessarily lead to an 
increase in the amount of approvisionnement intended to constitute the price of 
labour; it can be accompanied—at least  TEMPORARILY—by  an absolute diminution 
of this element of capital, and consequently by a reduction in the price of labour" 
([p.] 63).» 
//This is Sismondian; the effect on the wage level is the only 
aspect considered by Cherbuliez. This problem does not arise at all 
in an investigation where the  * value of labour is always supposed 
to be paid, and the fluctuations of the market price of labour 
beyond or below that point (the value) are not taken into 
consideration.*// 
"The producer who wishes to introduce a new division of labour in his 
enterprise or to exploit some natural force, will not wait until he has accumulated 
sufficient capital to be able to employ in this new way all the workers he needed 
previously. In the case of division of labour, he will perhaps be satisfied to produce

Cherbuliez 305 
with 5 workers what he previously produced with 10. In the case of the 
exploitation of a natural force, he will perhaps use only 1 machine and 2 workers. 
The approvisionnement will, in consequence, be reduced to 1,500 in the first case 
and to 600 in the second. But since the number of workers remains the same, their 
competition will soon force the price of labour below its original level" 
([pp.] 63-64). a "This is one of the most astonishing results of the law of 
appropriation. The absolute increase in wealth, that is, in the products of labour, 
does not give rise to a proportional increase and may lead to a diminution in the 
approvisionnement for the workers, in the portion they receive of all kinds of 
products" ([p.] 64). "The factors determining the price of labour" //in this context it 
is always a question only of the MARKET  PRICE OF  LABOUR// "are the absolute amount of 
productive capital and the ratio between the different elements of capital, two social 
facts on which the will of the workers can exercise no influence" ([p.] 64). "Nearly all 
the odds are against the worker" (I.e.). 
The ratio between the different elements of productive capital is 
determined in two ways. First: By the organic composition of 
productive capital. By this we mean the technological composition. 
With a given productive power of labour, which can be taken as 
constant so long as no CHANGE occurs, the amount of raw material 
and means of labour, that is, the amount of constant capital—in 
terms of its material elements—which corresponds to a definite 
quantity of living labour (paid or unpaid), that is, to the material 
elements of variable capital, is determined in every sphere of 
production. 
If the proportion of the objectified labour to the living labour 
employed is small, then the portion of the product that represents 
living labour will be large regardless of how this portion is divided 
between capitalist and worker. If the reverse is the case, the 
contrary result will occur. With a given rate of exploitation of labour, 
the surplus labour too will be large in the former case and small in 
the latter. This can only CHANGE as a result of a CHANGE in the mode 
of production which alters the technological relationship between 
the two parts of capital. Even in this case, the absolute amount of 
living labour employed by the capital which uses a greater 
proportion of constant capital may be equal or even larger if 
capitals of different size are compared. But it must be smaller 
relatively. For capitals of the same size, or calculated in proportion 
to the total capital—100 for example—it must be smaller both 
relatively and absolutely. All CHANGES arising from the development 
(not the decline) of the productive power of labour, reduce that 
part of the product which represents living labour, that is, they 
reduce variable capital. Regarding capitals [XVIII-1113] invested 
in different branches of production, one can say [that these 
a Marx quotes partly in German and partly in French.— Ed. 

=====第316页=====
306 Theories of Surplus Value 
changes] reduce the variable capital absolutely in those branches 
which have reached a higher level of production, since wages are 
assumed to be equal. 
So much with regard TO THE CHANGES arising from changes in the 
mode of production. 
Secondly, however, if one assumes that the organic composition of 
capitals is given and likewise the differences which arise from the 
differences in their organic composition, then the value ratio can 
change although the technological composition remains the same. 
What can happen is: a) a CHANGE in the value of the constant 
capital; b) a CHANGE in the value of the variable capital; c) a  CHANCE 
in both, in equal or unequal proportions. 
a) If the technological composition remains the same and a 
CHANGE in the value of constant capital takes place, its value will 
either fall or rise. If it falls, and only the same amount of living 
labour is employed as previously, i.e. if the scale or level of 
production remains the same, if, for example, 100 men are 
employed as previously, the same physical amount of raw 
material and means of labour continues to be required. But 
the SURPLUS LABOUR BEARS A GREATER PROPORTION TO THE WHOLE CAPITAL AD­
VANCED. The rate of profit rises. In the opposite case it declines. In 
the former case,  * for the capitals already employed in that sphere 
(not those newly invested in * it  * after the change of value in the 
elements of constant capital has taken place), the total sum of the 
capital employed diminishes or some portion of that capital is set 
free,  although production continues to be carried on on the same 
scale; or the capital so liberated is added to the production and 
then works like an accumulation of capital. The scale of 
production is enlarged, and the absolute amount of surplus labour 
is increased proportionally.* With a given mode of  production,  every 
accumulation of capital results in an INCREASE in the TOTAL  AMOUNT  OF 
surplus value WHATEVER THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE may BE. 
Conversely, if the VALUE OF THE ELEMENTS OF CONSTANT capital in­
creases, then * either the scale of production (hence the mass of the 
total capital advanced) must increase to employ the same quantity of 
labour (the same variable capital—unchanged in its value) as 
before; and then, although the absolute amount of surplus value, 
and the rate of surplus value, remains the same, its proportion to 
the whole capital advanced sinks, and, hence, the rate of profit 
falls.*  Or the scale of production and the TOTAL SUM OF CAPITAL 
ADVANCED is not enlarged. In the latter case the variable capital must 
decrease whatever the circumstances. If the same sum as previously 
is laid out in constant capital, it now represents a smaller amount of 

=====第317页=====
Cherbuliez 307 
material elements and since the technological conditions remain the 
same,  * less labour is to be employed. The whole capital advanced is 
then diminished by the labour dismissed; the total value of the 
capital advanced is diminished, but of that diminished capital the 
constant capital bears (value considered) a greater proportion. The 
surplus value is diminished absolutely, because less labour is 
employed; and the proportion of the remaining surplus value to the 
total capital advanced is diminished, because variable capital bears a 
less proportion to constant capital. 
On the other hand, if the whole capital is employed as 
before—the less value of the variable capital (representing a less 
quantity of the whole of labour (living labour) employed) being 
absorbed by the greater value of the constant capital; the one 
being diminished in the same proportion as the other is 
augmented—then the absolute quantity of surplus value sinks, 
because less labour is employed, and, at the same time, the 
proportion of this surplus value to the whole capital advanced 
falls.  Thus the rate of profit sinks from two causes, the diminution 
in the amount of surplus labour, and the decreasing proportion 
borne by that surplus labour to the total capital advanced.* 
In the first case (with SINKING VALUE OF THE ELEMENTS OF CONSTANT 
CAPITAL) where the rate of profit rises in all circumstances the scale 
of production must be extended if the amount of profit is to 
increase. Let us assume that the capital is 600—half constant, half 
variable. If the constant capital were to lose V2 its value, it would 
only amount to 150, although the variable capital would remain 
300. The total capital employed would be only 450, 150 being 
freed. If the 150 are added to the capital again, then 1284/7 of the 
150 will now be laid out in variable [XVIII-1114] capital. Thus the 
scale of production is expanded and more labour employed, if the 
same capital continues to be used in the production process. 
In the opposite case, where with RISING VALUE OF THE ELEMENTS OF 
CONSTANT  CAPITAL  the rate of profit falls in all circumstances, the  scale of 
production, and therefore THE  CAPITAL ADVANCED, must be INCREASED if the 
amount of profit is not to decrease and the amount of labour 
employed (and therefore SURPLUS VALUE) is to remain the  same.  If this is 
not done, if only THE  OLD  OR LESS  THAN  THE  OLD CAPITAL is  ADVANCED,  then not 
only does the rate of profit decline, but also the amount of profit. 
The rate of surplus value remains unchanged in both cases; it 
changes, however, if any change in the technological composition of 
capital takes place: it increases if the constant capital increases 
(because labour is then more productive) and declines when it falls 
(because labour is then less productive).

308 Theories  of Surplus Value 
b) If there  is any  CHANGE  in the  value  of  variable capital 
independent  of the  organic composition,  it can  only occur because  of 
a fall  or a  rise  in the  price  of means  of subsistence that  are not 
produced  in the  sphere  of production under consideration  but 
enter into  it as  commodities from outside. 
If the  value  of variable capital falls,  it nevertheless represents  the 
same amount  of  living labour  as  before.  The  same quantity  of 
labour merely costs less.  If therefore  the  scale  of production remains 
the same (since  the  value  of constant capital  is unchanged), then 
the part  of the  total capital used  for the  purchase  of labour  is 
diminished. Less capital needs  to be  laid  out in  order  to pay the 
same number  of  workers. Thus,  in  this case,  if the  scale  of 
production remains  the  same,  the  amount  of  capital laid  out 
diminishes.  The  rate  of profit increases,  and  this for two  reasons. 
The  SURPLUS VALUE  has increased; the ratio of living labour to 
objectified labour  has  remained  the  same,  but the  increased  SURPLUS 
VALUE  correlates with  a smaller total capital.  If, on the  other hand, 
the capital freed  is again invested, then this = accumulation. 
If the  value  of the  variable capital increases, then  a greater total 
capital must  be  laid  out in  order  to employ  the  same number  of 
workers  as  before, because  the  value  of the  constant capital 
remains  the  same  and  that  of the  variable capital  has  risen.  The 
amount  of  labour remains  the  same,  but a  smaller part  of it is 
SURPLUS LABOUR,  and  this smaller part corresponds  to a  larger capital. 
This takes place when  the  scale  of production remains  the  same, while 
the value  of the  total capital increases.  If the  value  of the  total 
capital does  not  increase,  the  scale  of production must  be  reduced. 
The amount  of  L,ABOUR  declines  and a  smaller portion  of  this 
reduced amount constitutes  SURPLUS LABOUR, WHICH, TOO, BEARS  A SMALLER 
PROPORTION  TO THE  WHOLE CAPITAL ADVANCED. 
The  ORGANIC CHANGES  and those brought about by  CHANGES OF VALUE 
can have  a similar effect  on the  rate  of  profit  in  certain 
CIRCUMSTANCES.  They differ however  in the  following  way. If the 
latter are not due simply to  FLUCTUATIONS  OF MARKET PRICES  and are 
therefore  not  temporary, they  are  invariably caused  by an  ORGANIC 
CHANGE  in the  spheres that provide  the  elements  of constant  or of 
variable capital. 
It is not  necessary here  to examine  CASE  3 in  detail. 
In the  case  of capitals  of equal size—or  if the  calculation  is 
based  on  equal amounts  of the  total capital,  100, for  example— 
the organic composition  may be the  same  in  different spheres  of 
production,  but the  value ratio  of the  primary component parts  of 
constant  and  variable capital  may be  different according  to the 

=====第319页=====
Cherbuliez 309 
different values of the amount of instruments and raw materials 
used. For example, copper instead of iron, iron instead of lead, 
wool instead of cotton, etc. 
On the other hand, is it possible for the organic composition to 
be different if the value ratio remains the same? If the organic 
composition is the same, the relative amounts which constitute 
constant capital and living labour are the same per 100. The 
quantitative proportions are the same. The value of the constant 
capital may be the same, although the relative amounts of labour 
set in motion are different. If the machinery or raw materials are 
dearer (or cheaper), less labour, for example, may be required, 
but in this case the value of the variable capital is also relatively 
smaller or vice versa. 
[XVIII-1115] Let us take A and B. c' and v' are the component 
parts (in terms of value) of A, and c and v those of B (in terms of 
value).  If c':v'  = c:v, then c'v = v'c. Consequently likewise  —= —. 
C V 
Since the value ratios [of constant to variable capital] are equal, 
only the following variations are possible. If in one sphere more 
surplus labour is carried out [than in another sphere] (for example, 
night-work is impossible in agriculture, and although the individu­
al agricultural labourer can be overworked, nevertheless the total 
amount of labour which can be expended on a given area of land, 
etc., is limited by the object being produced (corn), whereas in a 
factory of a given size the amount produced depends (8vva(jLeia) 
on the hours of labour worked) (that is to say, it is due to the 
different modes of production that more surplus labour can be 
employed in one sphere at a given level of production than in 
another), then, even if the value ratio of constant and variable 
capital is the same, the amount of labour employed in proportion 
to the total capital will nevertheless be different. 
Or, let us assume that the [raw] material is dearer and labour 
(of greater skill) is dearer, in the same proportion. In this case A 
employs 5 workers, where B employs 25, and they cost him 
£100—as much as the 25 workers, because their labour is dearer 
(their surplus labour is therefore also worth more). These 5 
workers work up 10 lbs of raw material, ;y,=500 and B's workers 
work up 1,000 lbs of raw material, x, worth 500, because the raw 
material is dearer and the productive power of labour is less highly 
developed in the case of A. The value ratio here—£100 v to 
a Potentially.— Ed.

500 c—is  the same in both cases, but the organic composition is 
different. 
The value ratio is the same: the value of constant capital in A is 
the same as in B, and proportionately A lays out the same amount 
of capital in wages as B. But the quantity of his products will be 
smaller. Although he employs the same absolute quantity of labour 
as B, he uses more relatively, because his constant capital is dearer. 
He processes less raw material, etc., in the same time, but this 
smaller quantity costs him as much as the larger quantity 
processed by B. The value ratio in this case is the same, the 
organic composition is different. In the other case the value ratio 
being assumed to be the same, this can occur only if the amounts 
of the surplus labour are different or if the values of the different 
kinds of labour are different. 
The organic composition can be taken to mean the following: 
Different ratios in which it is necessary to expend constant capital 
in the different spheres of production in order to absorb the same 
amount of labour. The combination of the same amount of labour 
with the object of labour requires either that both more raw 
material and more MACHINERY are used in one case than in the 
other, or that more if only one of these is used. 
//Where the ratios between fixed and circulating capital are very 
different, those between constant and variable capital can be the 
same, consequently the  SURPLUS  VALUE can be the same although the 
values produced annually must be different. Let us assume that in 
the coal industry—where no raw materials are used (apart from 
matières instrumentales), the fixed capital constitutes half the total 
capital and variable capital the other  half.  Let us assume that in 
tailoring the fixed capital=0 (as in the previous case we disregard 
matières instrumentales), that the raw materials =1/2 and the variable 
capital='/2- Given the same degree of exploitation of labour, both 
will realise the same amount of  SURPLUS  VALUE,  since both employ the 
same amount of labour in proportion to capital, i.e. per 100. But 
let us assume that fixed capital in the coal industry turns over 
once every 10 years while there is no difference in the rate of 
turnover of circulating capital in both cases. At the end of the year 
(we will assume that the variable capital turns over once a year in 
both cases) the tailor's capital will have produced values amounting 
to 150 if the surplus VALUE=50. The coal producer, on the other 
hand, will have produced values amounting to 105 at the end of 
the first year (consisting of 5 for fixed capital, 50 for variable and 
50 for surplus labour). As in the case of the tailor (the total value 
of his product+the fixed capital=150, that is, the 

=====第321页=====
Cherbuliez 311 
product= 105+45 for the remaining fixed capital). The production 
of different magnitudes of value therefore does not preclude the 
production of the same amount of SURPLUS VALUE. 
In the 2nd year, the fixed capital of the coal producer 
would=45,  variable capital=50 and surplus value=50, that is, the 
capital advanced would=95 and the profit would =  50. The rate of 
profit would have risen, because the value of the fixed [XVIII-
1116] capital would have declined by Vio as a result of wear and 
tear during the first year. Thus there can be no doubt that in the 
case of all capitals employing a great deal of fixed capital— 
provided the scale of production remains unchanged—the rate of 
profit must rise in proportion as the value of the machinery, the 
fixed capital, declines annually, because wear and tear has already 
been taken into account. If the coal producer sells his coal at the 
same price throughout the 10 years, then his rate of profit must 
be higher in the 2nd year than it was in the 1st  AND  so FORTH. Or 
one would have to assume that the maintenance work, etc., stands 
in direct proportion to the depreciation, so that the total sum 
advanced annually under the heading of fixed capital remains the 
same. This extra profit may be equalised also as a result of the fact 
that—apart from wear and tear—the value of fixed capital falls in 
the course of time, because it has to compete with new, more 
recently invented, better machinery. On the other hand, this 
falling2 rate of profit, which results naturally from wear and tear, 
makes it possible for the declining value of the fixed capital to 
compete with newer, better machinery, the full value of which has 
still to be taken into account. Finally, the coal producer sold his 
coal more cheaply [at the end of the second year] on the basis of 
the following calculation: 50 on 100 means 50% profit, 50% on 95 
comes to 47 /V, if therefore he sold the same quantity of coal [not 
for 105 but] for 4772—then he would have sold it more cheaply 
than the man whose machinery, for example, began to operate 
only in the current year. Large installations of fixed capital 
presuppose possession of large amounts of capital. And since these 
big owners of capital dominate the market, it appears that only for 
this reason their enterprises yield  SURPLUS  PROFIT (rent). In the case 
of agriculture, this rent derives from working relatively fertile 
land, but here we are dealing with a case where relatively cheaper 
machinery is utilised.//

with the relation of fixed to circulating capital, refer to the

difference between variable  and  constant capital. First  of all, the 
proportion  of  constant  to  variable capital  can be the  same 
although  the  proportion  of fixed  to circulating capital  is different. 
Secondly,  in the  case  of  constant  and  variable capital  it is a 
question  of the  primary division  of  capital between living  and 
objectified labour,  not of the  modification  of  this relationship  by 
the circulation process  or the  influence  of  this latter  on 
reproduction. 
It is  clear d'abord that the  difference between fixed  and 
circulating capital  can  affect surplus value (apart from  the 
differences  in the  mass  of living labour employed,  i.e.  differences 
which  are  related  to the  ratio  of variable  to constant capital) only 
in so far as it  affects  the  turnover  of the  total capital.  It is  therefore 
necessary  to investigate  how  the  turnover affects surplus value.  Two 
factors  are  obviously closely connected with  it: 1)  SURPLUS VALUE 
cannot  be  accumulated, reconverted into capital,  so  rapidly  (so 
often);  2) the  capital advanced must increase both  to continue  to 
employ  the  same number  of  workers,  etc., and  because  the 
advances  [of  money] which  the  capitalist makes  to himself  to cover 
his own  consumption costs must extend over  a longer period. 
These factors  are  important  in  connection with profit. Here 
however  it is, to  begin with, only necessary  to examine  how  they 
affect  SURPLUS VALUE.  One  must moreover always clearly distinguish 
between these  two  factors.// 
//Everything which increases  the  advances without proportionally 
increasing  the  surplus value, reduces  the  rate  of profit  EVEN  IF THE 
SURPLUS  VALUE REMAINS  THE  SAME;  the  opposite  is the  case with everything 
which reduces them.  In so far,  therefore,  as a  large amount  of 
fixed capital  in  proportion  to  circulating capital—or different 
turnover periods  of  capital—affects  the  size  of the  advances, 
it affects  the  rate  of  profit  EVEN  IF NOT  AT ALL AFFECTING  THE  SURPLUS 
VALUE.// 
//The rate  of profit  is not  SIMPLY  the  SURPLUS VALUE  calculated  on 
the capital advanced, but  THE  MASS  OF SURPLUS VALUE REALISED WITHIN  A 
GIVEN PERIOD,  that  is, in a  definite period  of circulation.  In so far as 
the difference between fixed  and  circulating capital affects  the  MASS 
OF SURPLUS VALUE  which  a particular capital yields  WITHIN  A GIVEN  PERIOD, 
it affects  the  rate  of  profit.  Two  aspects must  be  taken into 
consideration: [firstly,]  the  difference  in the  size  of the  advances 
(RELATIVE  TO THE SURPLUS VALUE REALISED)  and  SECONDLY, THE DIFFERENCE IN THE 
LENGTH  OF  TIME  FOR  WHICH THESE ADVANCES HAVE  TO BE  MADE BEFORE THEY  ARE 
RETURNED WITH  A SURPLUS.// 
[XVIII-1117]  //The  reproduction time,  or rather,  the  number  of 

=====第323页=====
Cherbuliez 313 
reproductions taking place in a definite period of time, is 
substantially affected by 2 circumstances: 
1) The product remains longer in the sphere of production proper. It is 
possible firstly that, in order to be produced, one product requires 
a longer period of time than another; it may require a larger part 
of a year, a whole year or even more than a year. (The latter is the 
case for example with buildings, in stock-breeding and the 
production of certain luxuries.) In this case, the product continual­
ly absorbs labour—often a great deal of labour is absorbed (for 
instance by luxury articles and buildings) in relation to the 
constant capital—the amount depending on the composition of 
the productive capital, its division into constant and variable 
capital. Thus in the measure as the time required for the 
production of the commodity increases and the labour process 
continues uniformly, a continuous absorption of labour and of 
surplus labour takes place. This happens for example with cattle 
or buildings if the latter require say more than a year's work. The 
product can enter the sphere of circulation, that is, it can be sold, 
be thrown on the market, only when the work is completed. The 
surplus labour expended in the first year is embodied with the rest 
of the labour in the unfinished product of the first year. It is 
neither greater nor smaller than in other branches of production 
where the ratio between constant and variable capital is the same. 
But the value of the product cannot be realised, that is, in the sense 
that it cannot be converted into money, and neither can the SURPLUS 
VALUE. The latter cannot therefore be accumulated as capital nor 
used for consumption. The capital advanced, and also the SURPLUS 
VALUE, serve, so to speak, as foundations for further production. 
They are a precondition for it and enter, to some extent, as 
semi-finished products, or, d'une manière ou d'une autre,* as raw 
material into the production process of the 2nd year. 
Let us assume that the capital is [£]500, labour=100 and 
surplus value=50, so that the capital advanced in 
production=550+500 which is advanced in the 2nd year. The 
surplus value again=50. The value of the product is 
therefore=£l,100, of which 100 is surplus value. In this case, the 
surplus value is the same as if the capital had been reproduced in 
the first year and £500 had been invested again in the 2nd year. 
In each year the variable capital employed is 100 and the surplus 
value 50. But the rate of profit is different. In the first year it is 50, 
or 10%. But in the second year the capital advanced amounts to 
a In one way or another.— Ed.

550+500=1,050, and Vio of this=105. If one assumes the same 
rate of profit, then the value of the product comes to: 550 in the 
1st year; 550+500+55 + 50=1,155 in the 2nd year. At the end of 
the 2nd year, the value of the product=  1,155.  Otherwise it would 
have been only  1,100.  In this case, the profit is greater than the 
surplus value produced, for this only amounts to 100. If one 
includes the consumption costs which the capitalist has to advance 
over 2 years, then the capital laid out is even greater in proportion 
to the surplus value. On the other hand, it is true that the entire 
surplus value gained in the first year has been converted into 
capital in the 2nd. Furthermore, the capital laid out in wages is 
greater, because the 100 is not reproduced at the end of the first 
year, so that in the 2nd year 200 must be advanced for the same 
labour for which 100 would have been sufficient if it had been 
reproduced in the 1st year. 
Secondly. After the labour process has been completed, the 
product must continue to remain in the production sphere in 
order to undergo natural processes which require either no labour 
or relatively quite insignificant amounts of it, like wine in the 
cellar. Only when this period has elapsed can the capital be 
reproduced. It is obvious that in this case, quite irrespective of 
what the ratio of variable to constant capital may have been, the 
effect is the same as if more constant and less variable capital had 
been laid out. The SURPLUS LABOUR, as well as the total amount of 
LABOUR employed during a definite period of time, is smaller. If the 
rate of profit is the same, this is due to equalisation, not to the 
amount of  SURPLUS  VALUE  produced in this sphere. More capital must 
be advanced beforehand to maintain the reproduction process— 
the continuity of production. And for this very reason the SURPLUS 
VALUE  declines in proportion to the capital advanced. 
Thirdly. Interruptions in the labour  process  while the product is in 
the production process, as in agriculture or in processes such as 
tanning, etc., where chemical processes involve intervals before the 
product can proceed from one stage to the next, higher one. If in 
such cases the interval is reduced by chemical discoveries, the 
productivity of labour rises, the SURPLUS VALUE [is increased] and 
objectified labour has to be advanced for a shorter period of time. 
In all these cases, the SURPLUS VALUE is smaller and the advanced 
capital larger. 
2) The same thing happens if the rate of turnover of the 
circulating capital is lower than the AVERAGE because of distant 
markets. In this case, too, the advanced capital is greater, the 
SURPLUS VALUE smaller and its proportion to the advanced capital is

also smaller.// //In the latter case [the capital] is retained longer in 
the circulation sphere, in the former case, in the production 
sphere.// 
[XVIII-1118] //Let us assume that the capital advanced in some 
branch or other of the transport industry =1,000, fixed 
capital=500, which will be worn out in 5 years. The variable 
capital, which=500, turns over 4 times during the year. The 
annual value of the product will thus be 100 + 500+100, if the 
[annual] rate of surplus value=20%, a total of 700. On the other 
hand, let us assume that in a branch of tailoring the constant 
capital, which consists only of circulating capital, = 500 (the fixed 
capital=0) and the variable capital=500. Surplus value=100. [The 
capital] turns over 4 times a year. Then the (annual) value of the 
product will be 4 (500+500)+100=4,100. The surplus value is the 
same in both cases. In the last-mentioned case, the entire capital 
turns over 4 times a year or once a quarter. Of the other capital 
600 turn over in the course of a year, therefore —=  150 in a 
quarter of a year. That is, 50 in a month, 100 in 2 months, and 
400 in 8 months. The whole capital requires 1 year and 8 months 
or 20 months, in order to turn over. In a year, only 6/io of it turns 
over. 
Now it will be said that in order to make a profit of 10%, less is 
added per quarter on a value of 1,000 in the case of the first 
capital than in that of the other. But here it is not a question of 
addition. One makes more surplus value on the capital used up 
but not on the capital employed. The difference here arises from 
the surplus value, not from the addition of profit. The difference 
here lies in the value, not in the surplus value. In both cases the 
variable capital amounting to 500 turns over 4 times in a year. 
Both capitals yield a surplus value of 100 in a year, the [annual] 
rate of surplus value=20%. But £25 in a quarter, therefore a 
higher percentage? 25 on 500 each quarter=5% a quarter, that is, 
20%  per annum. 
The first [capitalist] turns over V2 his capital 4 times a year and 
only V5 of the remaining V2 once during the year. A half of four 
times is twice. Thus he turns his capital over 2 /10 times during the 
year. The entire capital of the second capitalist turns over 4 times 
a year. But this makes absolutely no difference to the  SURPLUS  VALUE. 
If the second capitalist continues the reproduction process 
uninterruptedly, then he must constantly convert 500 into raw 
materials, etc., and must always use 500 for labour, while the other 
capitalist likewise uses 500 for labour and has invested the

remaining 500 once and for all (that is, for 5 years) in such a form 
that he does not need to reconvert it again. This applies however 
when the ratio of variable to constant capital is the same [in both 
capitals] despite the difference between fixed and circulating 
capital. If in both cases, 1/2  consists of constant and V2 of variable 
capital, then it is only possible for V2 [in one case] to consist of 
fixed capital if the circulating constant capital=0, and [in the other 
case],  V2 can consist of circulating constant capital only if the fixed 
capital=0. Although the circulating constant capital can=0, as in 
the extractive and transport industries where, however, the 
matières instrumentales rather than the raw materials constitute the 
circulating constant capital, the fixed capital can never=0 (except 
in banking, etc.). This is however immaterial so long as the ratio of 
constant capital to variable capital is the same in both cases, even 
though in one case there may be more fixed and less circulating 
constant capital than in the other, or vice versa. The only 
difference here is the time of reproduction required by one half 
of the capital and by the total capital. One capitalist must invest a 
capital of £500 for 5 years before it is returned to him, the other, 
for a quarter of a year or a whole year. The ability to dispose of 
the capital is different. The amount advanced is the same but the 
time for which it is advanced is different. This difference does not 
concern us here. When one considers the total capital advanced, 
surplus value and profit are the same—£100 in the first year on 
the 1,000 advanced. In the second year, it is rather the fixed 
capital that has a higher rate of profit, since the variable capital 
has remained the same, whereas the value of the fixed capital has 
declined. The capitalist only advances 400 fixed and 500 variable 
capital in the 2nd year and receives a profit of 100 as he did 
before. But 100 on 900=ll'/9%, while the other capitalist, if he 
continues to reproduce his capital, advances 1,000 as he did 
previously and makes a profit of 100=10%. 
The position is different, of course, if, along with the fixed 
capital, the constant capital as a whole increases as compared with 
the variable, or if altogether more capital must be advanced in 
order to set the same amount of labour in motion. In the case 
discussed above, the question is not how often the total capital is 
returned or how large the advance is, but how often that portion 
is returned which is sufficient to set the same amount of 
productive labour in motion as that used in the other instance, in 
order to renew the process of production. However, if in the case 
cited above, the fixed capital were [not 500 but] 1,000 and the 
circulating capital only 500 [as previously], then matters would be 

=====第327页=====
Cherbuliez  317 
different. This, however, would  not be due to the  fact that  it is 
fixed capital.  For if the  circulating part  of the  constant capital  in 
the second case were  to amount  to 1,000  [instead  of 500]  (because 
of the  dearness  of [raw]  materials,  for  example), then  the  result 
would  be the  same. Since  in the  first examples  [of the two  cases] 
the larger  the  fixed capital,  the  greater  the  relative size  of the 
capital advanced  as a  whole  to the  variable capital, these  two 
factors  are  often confused. Moreover,  the  whole business  of the 
turnover  was in  fact originally derived from mercantile capital, 
where  it is  determined  by different laws.  In the  case  of mercantile 
capital,  as I  have demonstrated,174  the  rate  of profit  is indeed 
determined  by the  AVERAGE  number  of turnovers, regardless  of the 
composition  of  this type  of capital which, incidentally, consists 
mainly  of circulating capital.  For in the  case  of mercantile capital, 
profit is determined by the  GENERAL RATE OF PROFIT.// 
[XVIII-1119]  // The  point  is this.  If the  fixed capital=x,  and it 
turns over only once every  15  years, then  V15 of it is  turned over 
in a single year,  but  likewise only  V15  needs  to be  replaced each 
year.  It would make  no  difference  at all if it  were replaced  15 
times  in a  year.  Its  mass would still  be the  same  as before.  The 
product would only become dearer  as a  result.  But it is  more 
difficult  to  dispose  of it and the  risk  of depreciation  is greater 
than  if the  same amount  of capital were advanced  in the  form  of 
circulating capital.  But  this does  not  affect  the  surplus  in any way, 
although  it does enter into  the  capitalists' calculation  of the  rate  of 
profit since this risk  is  included  in the  calculation  of the 
depreciation.  As far as the  other part  of capital  is concerned,  let us 
assume that  the  circulating part  of constant capital— matières brutes 
and matières instrumentales —amounts  to  25,000  a year  and  wages 
to 5,000.  If it  were returned only once during  the  year 30,000 
would have  to be  advanced during  the  whole year,  and if the 
surplus value were  at the  rate  of 100% it  would amount  to 5,000, 
and profit  at the end of the  year would  be  5,000  on 
30,000,= 16 2/s%  (Ve)- If. on the  other hand,  the  capital turns over 
five times during  the  year, then  a capital advance  of only  5,000  for 
constant circulating capital  and 1,000 for  wages will  be sufficient. 
Surplus value will  be 1,000,  and for 5/5 of a  year 5,000.  But  this 
surplus value  is made  on a  capital  of £6,000, because more than 
this amount  is never advanced. Profit would therefore  be 5,000  on 
6,000,  or 5/6,  five times  as much  [as  previously], that  is,  83'/3%-
(Disregarding fixed capital.) There  is thus  a very considerable 
difference  in the  rate  of profit because,  in fact, labour worth  5,000 
is bought with  a capital  of 1,000 and raw  materials,  etc.,  worth

25,000 with a capital of 5,000. If the amounts of capital were 
equal in these cases of different rates of turnover, then only 6,000 
need have been advanced in the first case, that is, only 500 a 
month, 5/6  of which would have consisted of constant capital and 
VÔ of variable capital. This 1/6 would=8373, on which surplus value 
at 100% would be  83V3,  and this would amount in a year to

Sismondian: 
"In so far as the economic progress of society is characterised by an absolute 
growth of productive capital and by a change in the proportions between the diffe­
rent elements of this capital, it offers the workers some advantages: 1) The greater 
productivity of labour, resulting especially from the use of machinery, brings about 
such a rapid growth of productive capital that despite the change that takes place 
in the proportion of the approvisionnement to the other elements of capital, 
this element nevertheless increases absolutely, which makes it possible not only to 
employ the same number of workers as before, but also an additional number, so 
that for the workers the result of progress apart from some interruptions means 
an increase in productive capital and in the demand for labour. 2) The greater 
productivity of capital tends to diminish the value of the whole mass of products 
considerably, thus placing them within reach of the workers, thereby increasing the 
range of enjoyments they are able to obtain" (I.e., [p.] 65). a 
On the other hand: 
"1) However impermanent, however partial the temporary diminution of the 
approvisionnement which constitutes the price of labour may be, it produces harmful 
effects nevertheless. 2) The factors tending to promote the economic advance of 
society are for the most part accidental, independent of the will of the producing 
capitalist. The effects of these causes are therefore not permanent, etc." ([p.] 66). 
"3) It is not so much the absolute as the relative amount consumed by the worker 
which makes his lot happy or unhappy. What does it matter to the worker if he is 
able to obtain a few more products which formerly were inaccessible to him if the 
number of products inaccessible to him has grown in even greater proportion, if the distance 
which separates him from the capitalist has only increased, if his social position has 
deteriorated and become more disadvantageous? Apart from the consumption 
strictly necessary for the maintenance of our strength, the value of our enjoyments is 
essentially relative" ([p.] 67). 
"People frequently forget that the wage labourer is a thinking man, endowed 
with the same capacities, impelled by the same motives as the working capitalist" 
([p.] 67). 
[XVIII-1120] "Whatever advantages a rapid growth in social wealth may bring 
to the wage workers, it does not cure the causes of their poverty ... they continue to be 
deprived of all rights to capital and are consequently obliged to sell their labour and to 
renounce all claims to the products of that labour" ([p.] 68). "This is the principal error 
of the law of appropriation ... the evil lies in this absolute lack of any bond between 
the wage worker and the capital which is set in motion by his industry" ([pp.] 
68-69).

[only] on rent175 ([p.] 128) but since it is impossible 
"to impose a tax which is levied only on rent and affects nothing but rent" [pp. 
128-29],* 
since it is difficult to separate profit from rent and impossible 
when the landowner is himself the cultivator, Cherbuliez proceeds 
to 
2) the real conclusion of the Ricardian theory: 
"Why do people not take a step further and abolish private ownership of land?" 
([p.] 129).a "The landowners are idlers who are maintained at the public expense 
without any kind of benefit to industry or to the general welfare of society". "What 
makes land productive is the capital employed in agriculture; the landowner 
contributes nothing to it; he only exists to pocket rent, which does not constitute a 
part of the profit on his capital, neither is it the product of labour nor that of the 
productive power of the soil, but the effect of the price of the agricultural 
products, which is increased by the competition of the consumers", etc. ([p.] 129).a 
"Since the elimination of the private ownership of land would in no way change the 
causes responsible for rent, rent would continue to exist, but the state would receive it, 
for all the land would belong to it and it would lease out arable sections of the land to 
private persons owning sufficient capital to exploit them" ([p.] 130).a Rent would 
replace all state revenues. "Finally industry, liberated, released from all fetters, 
would take an unprecedented leap forward, etc." ([p.] 130).a 
But how does this Ricardian conclusion agree with the pious 
Sismondian wish to place "bonds" on capital and capitalist 
production? How does it agree with the lamentation: 
"Capital will ultimately rule the world if an upheaval does not halt the course 
which the development of our society is taking under the domination of the law of 
appropriation" ([p.] 152).a "Capital will eliminate the old social distinctions 
everywhere in order to replace them by this simple classification of men into rich 
and poor, the rich, who enjoy themselves and rule, and the poor, who work and 
obey" ([p.] 153).b "The general appropriation of productive wealth and of the products 
has always reduced the numerous class of proletarians to a position of subjugation 
and political impotence, but this appropriation was once combined with a system of 
restrictive laws which, by impeding the development of industry and the accumulation of

OF WEALTH, AND  ON  THE SOURCES OF TAXATION, LONDON, 
1831, PART  I, RENT 
Even this first work  ON  RENT  is distinguished  by  what has been 
lacking  in all English economists since Sir James Steuart, namely,  a 
sense  of the historical differences  in modes  of production. (Such  a 
correct DISTINCTION  of historical forms generally speaking  is not 
contradicted  by the very important archaeological, philological and 
historical BLUNDERS attributed  to  Jones.  See, for  example,  The 
Edinburgh Review, VOL.  LIV,  Article IV.177 ) He found that  the 
modern economists after Ricardo define rent  as  SURPLUS  PROFIT,  a 
definition which presupposes that  the  FARMER  is a  capitalist  (or a 
FARMING CAPITALIST who exploits the land), who expects AVERAGE PROFIT 
on the  capital which  he invests  in this particular sphere,  and  that 
agriculture itself  has  been subordinated  to the  capitalist mode  of 
production.  In  short, landed property  is conceived only  in its 
modern bourgeois form, that is,  in the modified form which  it has 
been given  by  capital,  the  dominant relation  of production  in 
society. Jones  by no  means shares the illusion that capital has been 
in existence since  the  beginning  of the  world. 
His views  on the origin  of rent in general are summarised  in the 
following passages: 
"The  POWER  of the earth  TO YIELD,  even  TO THE RUDEST LABOURS OF MANKIND, 
more than  is necessary  for  the subsistence  of the CULTIVATOR  himself,  enables him 
to pay a  tribute: hence  the  origin  of rent" ([p.]  4). 
"RENT  has  usually originated  in the  * appropriation  of [the] soil,  at a  time when 
the bulk  of the people must cultivate  it on  such terms as they can obtain,  or starve, 
and when their scanty capital  of implements, seeds, etc., being utterly insufficient 
to secure their maintenance  in any  other occupation than that  of agriculture,  is 
chained with them  to the  land  by an  overpowering necessity*"  [p. 11]. 
Jones traces rent throughout  all its  changes, from  its  crudest 
form, performance  of labour services,  to modern  FARMER'S  RENT.  He 
finds that everywhere  a specific form  of rent,  i.e. of  landed 
property, corresponds  to a  definite form  of labour  and of the

conditions  of labour. Thus,  LABOUR  RENTS  OR SERF  RENTS,  the  CHANGE  FROM 
178 LABOUR  RENTS  TO  PRODUCE  RENTS,  METAYER  RENTS,  RYOT  RENTS,  etC, are 
examined  in turn,  a development  the  details  of which  do not 
concern  us here.  In all  previous forms,  it is the  landed proprietor, 
not the  capitalist,  who  directly appropriates  the  SURPLUS  LABOUR  of 
other people. Rent  (as the  Physiocrats conceive  it by  reminiscence) 
appears historically (and still  on the  largest scale among  the  Asiatic 
peoples)  as the  general form  of surplus  LABOUR,  of LABOUR performed 
without payment  in return. The appropriation  of this  SURPLUS  LABOUR 
is here  not  mediated  by  exchange,  as is the  case  in capitalist 
society,  but its  basis  is the  forcible domination  of one  section  of 
society over  the  other. (There  is,  accordingly, direct slavery, 
serfdom  or political dependence.) 
Since  we are  only considering landed property here  in so far as 
an understanding  of it  contributes  to an  understanding  of capital, 
we shall leave Jones' analysis  and  proceed directly  to his 
result—which distinguishes  him  from,  and  shows  his  superiority 
over,  all his  predecessors. 
But first  a few  INCIDENTAL REMARKS. 
In discussing forced labour  and the  forms  of serfdom  (or  slavery) 
which correspond  to it  more  or less, [XVIII-1122] Jones uncon­
sciously emphasises  the two  forms  to which  all  SURPLUS  VALUE  (SURPLUS 
LABOUR)  can be  reduced.  It is  characteristic that,  in general, real 
forced labour displays  in the most brutal form, most  clearly,  the essential 
features  of wage labour. 
"Under these conditions" (where there  is serf labour) "rent  can  only  be 
increased either  by the  more skilful  and  effective utilisation  of the  labour  of the 
TENANTRY" //RELATIVE  SURPLUS  LABOUR//,  "this however is hampered by 
the inability  of the  PROPRIETORS  as A BODY  TO ADVANCE  THE  SCIENCE  OF AGRICULTURE,  or 
by an increase  in the  QUANTITY  of the  LABOUR  EXACTED,  and in  this case, while  the 
LANDS  of the PROPRIETORS will  be better TILLED, those  of the SERFS, from which labour 
has been withdrawn,  all the  worse" (I.e., CH.  II, [p. 61]). 
What distinguishes this book  on  RENT  by Jones from  his  SYLLABUS 
to be mentioned  in 2—is this:  In the  first work  he proceeds from 
the various forms  of landed property  as a  given fact;  in the 
second, from  the  various forms  of  labour  to  which they 
correspond. 
Jones also shows  how  different stages  in the  development  of the 
productive power  of social labour correspond  to these different 
production relations. 
Serf labour (just  as slave labour)  has  this in common with wage 
labour,  quoad*  rent, that  the  latter  is paid  in labour,  not in  products, 
still less  in money.

322 Theories of Surplus Value 
As far as  "METAYER RENT"  is concerned * "the advance of  stock  by the proprietor 
and the abandonment of the management of cultivation to the actual labourers shows 
the continued absence of an intermediate class of capitalists" (I.e., [p.] 74). 
"Ryot rents are produce rents paid by a labourer, raising his own  wages  from the soil, 
to the sovereign as its proprietor" (Ch. IV, [p. 109]).* (In Asia especially.)  "RYOT 
RENTS  are often mixed up with  LABOUR RENTS AND METAYER RENTS"  ([p.] 136 sqq.). 
[Under this system] the sovereign is the chief  LANDLORD.  * "The prosperity or 
rather the existence of [the] towns in Asia proceeds entirely from the  local  expenditure of 
[the] government"* (I.e. [p. 138]). 
* "Cottier*79 rents ... all rents contracted to be paid in money, by peasant tenants, 
extracting their own maintenance from the soil" * ([p.] 143). (Ireland) "Over the 
greater part of the globe, no  MONEY RENTS  are paid" [I.e.]. 
"All these  FORMS"  (SERF,  RYOT,  METAYER,  COTTIER,  etc., in  short,  PEASANTS' 
RENTS)  "PREVENT  THE  FULL  DEVELOPMENT  OF THE  PRODUCTIVE  POWERS  OF THE  EARTH. 
The difference in the productiveness of the industry depends first, on the  QUANTITY  OF 
CONTRIVANCE  USED  IN APPLYING  MANUAL  LABOUR,  and SECONDLY, on the  EXTENT  to 
which  the  MERE PHYSICAL EXERTIONS  ARE  ASSISTED  BY THE  ACCUMULATED  RESULTS  OF 
PAST  LABOUR,  in other words, on the different  * quantities of skill, knowledge and 
capital brought to the task of production. Small number of the agricultural 3 classes.  It 
is obvious that the relative numbers of persons who can be maintained without 
agricultural labour, must be measured wholly by the productive powers of the cultivators.." 
(Ch. VI [pp. 157-60]). "In England, the tenants who on the disuse of the labour of 
the serf tenantry took charge of the cultivation of the domains of the proprietors, 
were found on the land; they were yeomen"* ([p.] 166). 
We now come finally to the point which is of decisive interest to 
us here—FARMERS'RENTS.  It is here that Jones' superiority is most 
striking,  for he shows that what Ricardo and others regard as the 
eternal  form of landed property, is its bourgeois form, which, 
after  all, only develops 1) when landed property has ceased to be 
the dominant relation in production and, consequently, in society; 
2) when agriculture itself is carried on in a capitalist way, which 
presupposes the development of large-scale industry  (AT LEAST OF 
MANUFACTURE)  in the towns. Jones shows that rent in the Ricardian 
sense  only exists in a [XVIII-1123] society the basis of which is the 
capitalist  mode of production. As a consequence of the transfor­
mation  of rent into surplus  PROFIT,  the direct influence of landed 
property  on  WAGES  ceases, which, in other words, merely means 
that the landed proprietor ceases to be the direct  APPROPRIATOR  of 
SURPLUS  LABOUR,  this role being now assumed by the capitalist. The 
relative size of the rent affects only the division of  SURPLUS  VALUE 
BETWEEN  CAPITALIST  and  PROPRIETOR,  NOT THE  EXACTION  OF THAT  SURPLUS  LABOUR 
ITSELF.  This conclusion in fact emerges from Jones' analysis, though 
it is not explicitly stated. 
Jones  marks a substantial advance on Ricardo, in his historical 
explanation  as well as in the economic details. We shall follow his

In the following passages, Jones correctly explains the historical 
and economic conditions under which rent=suRPLus PROFIT, that  is, 
the expression  of modern landed property. 
*" Farmers' rents can only exist when  the  most important relations  of the different 
classes  of society have ceased  to originate  in the ownership and occupation  of the soil " * 
([p.] 185). 
The capitalist mode  of production begins with manufacture and 
only later subjugates agriculture. 
* "It is the  artisans  and the  handicraftsmen who first range themselves under 
the management  of capitalists" * ([p.] 187). 
"One  of the immediate consequences  of this system  is the POWER OF MOVING  AT 
PLEASURE  THE LABOUR AND CAPITAL EMPLOYED  IN  AGRICULTURE,  TO  OTHER OCCUPA­
TIONS". 
//And  on)/  with this POWER  can  there  be any  question  of 
equalisation  of AGRICULTURAL  and  INDUSTRIAL PROFITS.// 
"While the  TENANT  was himself * a labouring peasant, forced,  in the absence of 
other funds  for his  maintenance,  to extract  it himself from  the  soil,*  he was 
chained  to that soil  by necessity; the  LITTLE STOCK  he might possess,  * since  it was 
not sufficient  to procure him  a maintenance unless used  for  the single purpose of 
cultivation, was virtually chained  to the soil with  its master.* With the CAPITALIST-
MASTER this * dependence  on the  soil is broken;*  and  * unless  as much  can be 
gained by employing the working class on the  land,  as from their exertions  in various other 
employments, which  in such  a state  of society abound, the business  of cultivation will 
be abandoned. Rent,  in such  a case, necessarily consists merely  of surplus profits"  * 
([p.] 188).  "RENT  ceases  to have any influence on  * wages. When the engagement* 
of the * labourer  is with a capitalist, this dependence on the landlord is dissolved* " ([p.] 
188-89). 
As we  shall see later, Jones does not really explain how  SURPLUS 
PROFIT arises, or rather, he explains  it only in Ricardian fashion, i.e. 
BY THE DIFFERENCE  IN  THE DEGREES OF NATURAL FERTILITY  of  DIFFERENT  SOILS. 
" When  RENTS CONSIST OF SURPLUS PROFITS,  there  are 3  causes from which  the 
rent OF A  PARTICULAR  SPOT  OF  GROUND  may increase: 
"1) AN  INCREASE  OF  THE PRODUCE FROM THE ACCUMULATION  OF  LARGER  QUAN­
TITIES  OF CAPITAL  IN  ITS CULTIVATION; 
"2) the more efficient  APPLICATION  of CAPITAL  ALREADY  EMPLOYED; 
"3) the capital and produce remaining the same,  THE DIMINUTION  of the SHARE 
of the  PRODUCING  CLASSES  in that  PRODUCE AND  A CORRESPONDING  INCREASE  of the 
SHARE  of the  LANDLORD. 
"These causes may  COMBINE  IN  DIFFERENT  PROPORTIONS"  ([p.] 189). 
We shall see what  is involved  by these different causes. First of 
all they  all  presuppose that rent exists  as  SURPLUS PROFIT; and then 
there  is not the  slightest doubt that cause  1) to  which Ricardo 
alludes only once  and  then only incidentally, 180 is correct. When 
the capital employed  in agriculture increases, the amount  of rent 
increases  as well, even though  the  price  of corn, etc., does not rise

324 Theories  of Surplus Value 
and no other CHANGE whatever takes place.  It is  clear that,  in this 
case,  the  price  of land rises, although corn prices  do not and no 
CHANGE whatever takes place  in them. 
Jones declares rent  on the  WORST  SOIL  to be  monopoly price.  He 
therefore restricts  the  real source  of rent either  to monopoly price 
(in the  same  way as  Buchanan, Sismondi, Hopkins,181  and  others) 
if it is  absolute rent  (not  arising from differences  in the  fertility  of 
the different kinds  of soil)  or to  differential rent  (in the  Ricardian 
sense). 
IIAd vocem* absolute rent,  let us  take  a gold mine.  We  assume that 
the capital employed=£100,  the  AVERAGE profit  £10,  rent  £10, and 
that half  the  capital consists  of constant capital  (in  this case, 
machinery  and  matière instrumentale)  and half  of variable capital. 
The £50 of  constant capital means nothing more than that  it 
contains  the  same amount  of labour time  as [XVIII-1124]  is 
embodied  in £50  worth  of gold. That part  of the  product 
which=£50 therefore replaces this constant capital.  If the  rest  of 
the product=£100  and if 50  workers  are set to  work with  the £50 
of variable capital then  [the  labour  of] 50  workers (assuming  a 
working  day of 12  hours) must  be expressed  in £100  worth  of 
gold,  of which  £50  goes  to pay  wages  and £50  represents unpaid 
labour.  The  value  of the  products  of all  capitals  of the  same 
composition will then  be 120; the  product will then consist  of 50 c 
and 100, [the 100]  corresponding  to 50  working days, that  is, 50t/ 
plus 50 c.  A capital  of 100,  utilising more constant capital  and a 
smaller number  of workers, would produce  a product  of less 
value. However,  all ordinary industrial capitals, although  the  value 
of their products would,  in these circumstances, amount  to 120, 
would only sell them  at their production price  of 110. But in the 
case of the  gold mine, this  is impossible quite apart from  the 
OWNERSHIP  OF LAND,  because  in this case  the  value  is expressed  in the 
product  in kind.  A rent  of £10  would therefore  of necessity 
arise.// 
"Corn  CAN SELL  at a  monopoly price, that  is, at a  price which more than pays  the 
COSTS and PROFITS OF THOSE WHO CROW IT UNDER THE LEAST FAVOURABLE CIR­
CUMSTANCES;  or at  such  a price  as will only repay  the  COMMON PROFITS.  In the  first 
case abstracting from  all * difference  of fertility  in the  soils cultivated,  [the]  increased 
produce obtained  by increased capital (prices remaining  the  same)  may  increase  the 
rents,  in proportion  to the  increased capital laid out.*  For  example  10% be the 
ORDINARY RATE  OF  PROFIT.  If the  corn  PRODUCED  BY £100 CAN BE  SOLD  FOR 115, the 
rent would  be £5. If *in the  progress  of improvement  the  capital employed  on the 
same land were doubled,  and the  produce doubled,  the  £200 would yield 230 *  and 
*£10 would  be rent,  and the  rent will  be doubled*"  ([p.] 191).

//This  applies to  ABSOLUTE RENT  AS WELL  AS to DIFFERENTIAL RENT.// 
"In small  COMMUNITIES CORN  may be  constantly  at a  monopoly price... This  is 
possible  in  LARGER COUNTRIES  too,  provided  the  increase  of population keeps 
steadily ahead  of the  INCREASE  OF TILLAGE.  However monopoly price  of corn  is 
unusual in  COUNTRIES  of  CONSIDERABLE EXTENT  AND  GREAT VARIETY  OF  SOIL.  When 
prices rise steeply more lands  are  cultivated  or more capital  is laid out on the old 
lands,  till the  price hardly yields  the  ORDINARY PROFIT  on the  OUTLAY  any  longer. 
Then  TILLAGE  will  STOP,  and in  such countries  CORN  is usually sold  at a  price * not 
more than sufficient  to replace  the  capital employed under  the  least favourable 
circumstances  and the  ordinary rate  of profit  on it,* and the  * rent paid  on the 
better soils  is then measured  by the  excess  of their produce over that  of the  poorest 
soil cultivated  by similar capitals*" ([pp.] 191-92).  "All  that is necessary  to effect A 
RISE OF  RENT OVER  THE SURFACE  of a  country possessing SOILS  of unequal goodness, 
is this: that  the  * better soils should yield  to the  additional capital employed upon 
them  in the  progress  of cultivation, something more than  the  soils confessedly 
inferior  to them;  for  then while  [the]  means  can be  found  of employing fresh 
capital  on any  soil between  the  extremes  A and Z, at the  ordinary rate  of profit, 
rents will rise  on all the  soils superior  to that particular soil*"  ([p.] 195). "Let A 
have been cultivated with [£]100 yielding annually  110, £10  being  the  ordinary 
profits,  and B  with 100 yielding £115  and C  with  100  yielding £120  and so on to 
Z; the  rent  of B  would  be 5, and  that of C  10. Let  each  of these qualities  of soil be 
cultivated with  [a capital  of]  £200.  A will produce 220,  B 230,  C 240, etc.,  the  rent 
of B, therefore, will have become  10,  that of C 20, etc." ([p.] 193). 
"The GENERAL  ACCUMULATION  of the  capital employed  in cultivation, * while  it 
augments  the  produce  of all  gradations  of soils, somewhat  in proportion  to their 
original goodness, must  of itself raise rents* without  * reference  to any  progressive 
diminution  in the return to the labour and capital  employed,  and, indeed, quite independently 
of any  other cause whatever*"  ([p.] 195). 
It is one of  Jones' merits that  he is the  first  who  clearly brings 
out the  fact that *once rent  [is]  supposed,  its  growth will  on the 
whole //always supposing  no  revolutions  in the  mode  of  pro­
duction// result from  the  augmentation  of  agricultural capital,  of 
capital employed  on  land. "This  may be the  case  not  only  if 
prices remain  the  same  but  even when they fall below their former  * 
level". 
[XVIII-1125] Rejecting the  GRADUAL DIMINUTION  of productivity [in 
agriculture],  Jones remarks: 
* "The average corn produce  of England  at one time  did not  exceed  12 bushels 
per acre;  it is now  about double" ([p.] 199). "Each successive portion  of capital  and 
labour concentrated  on the  land  may be  more economically  and  efficiently applied 
than the  last" * ([pp.] 199-200). 
"Rent will double, triple  and  quadruple,  and so on, if the  capital invested  in the 
old land  is doubled, tripled, quadrupled * without  a diminished return,  and  without 
altering  the  relative fertility  of the  soils cultivated*"  ([p.] 204). 
This  is therefore  the  first point  on  which Jones  is in  advance  of 
Ricardo.  ONCE RENT  [is]  SUPPOSED,  IT MAY INCREASE  BY THE MERE INCREASE OF THE 
AMOUNT  OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED  on the  LAND,  irrespective of * any change 
either  in the  relative fertility  of the  soils,  or the  returns  of the 
22-613 

=====第336页=====
326 Theories  of Surplus Value 
successive doses  of capital employed,  or any  alteration whatever  in 
the price  of  agricultural produce.* 
Jones'  next point  is this: 
* "It is not  essential  to the  rise, that  the  proportion between the fertility  of the soils 
should  be  exactly stationary"  * ([p.] 205). 
(Here Jones overlooks  the  fact that, conversely,  an  increasing 
* disproportion, even when  the  whole agricultural capital  is more 
productively employed, must  and  will increase  the  amount  of the 
differential rent.  A diminution,  on  the  contrary,  in the  differences 
of the  fertility  of the  various soils must diminish  the  differential 
rent,  i.e.  rent flowing from those differences.  [By]  taking away  the 
cause  you  take away  the  effect. Still rent (apart from absolute rent) 
may increase, but*  in  that case *only  in  consequence  of an 
increase  of the  agricultural capital employed.*) 
"Ricardo  had overlooked  the  NECESSARILY  UNEQUAL  EFFECTS  OF ADDITIONAL 
CAPITAL  ON  SOILS  OF  UNEQUAL FERTILITY"  (I.e.). 
(This means nothing more than *that  the  employment  of 
additional capital adds  to the  differences  of  relative fertility,  and, 
in that  way,  to differential rent.*) 
"If numbers,  BEARING  A CERTAIN PROPORTION  TO  EACH OTHER,  are multiplied by 
the same number,  the  proportion will  be the  same  as that of the original numbers, 
yet THE  DIFFERENCES  between  THE  AMOUNTS  OF THE  SEVERAL PRODUCTS WILL INCREASE 
AT EACH  STEP  OF THE  PROCESS.  If 10,  15, 20,  be multiplied  by 2 or  4, and  become  20, 
30, 40, or 40, 60, 80,  THEIR RELATIVE PROPORTIONS  will  NOT  be DISTURBED:  80 and 
60 bear  the  same proportion  to 40, as 20 and 15 do to 10, but the  difference 
BETWEEN  THE  AMOUNTS  OF  THEIR  PRODUCTS  WILL HAVE INCREASED  AT  EACH OPERATION, 
AND FROM BEING  5 AND  10,  BECOME  10  AND  20,  AND THEN  20  AND  40" ([pp.] 206-07). 
This law  works  out  simply  as follows: 
1) 10,5 15,1° 20. The difference  5  [and 10].  Sum of  the differences 
15. 
2) 20,1° 
3) 40,20 
4) 80,t40l 30,20  40. 
60,40  80. 
120,[8°1  160. 10 [ and  20]. " " 30. 
20 [and  40]. " " 60. 
[" "  40 and  80. " "  120.] 
The difference between  the  terms  is  doubled  in 2 and 
quadrupled  in 3.  The sum  of the  differences  is likewise doubled  in 
2 and  quadrupled  in 3. 
This therefore  is the 2nd  law.  The  first law  (applied  by  Jones 
only to  DIFFERENTIAL RENT)  is that the  amount  of rent increases with 
the increase  of the  amount  of  capital employed.  If rent  is 5 for 
100, then  it is 10 for  200. 
fXVIII-1126]  The  second  law.  *A11 other circumstances remain­
ing the  same,  the  proportional difference between  the  capitals

employed  on different soils remaining  the  same,  the  amount  of that 
difference,  and  hence  the  amount  of the  aggregate rent  or the sum 
of those differences, increases with  the  absolute quantity  of that 
difference  resulting from  the  increase  of the  capitals employed.* 
Hence  the  second  law is: The  amount  of differential rent increases 
in proportion  as the  differences  of the  products increase when  the 
relative  FERTILITY  remains the same, but  CAPITAL EMPLOYED  ON THE 
DIFFERENT SOILS  is increased uniformly. 
Further:  "If  [£]100  BE  EMPLOYED  ON  CLASSES  A, B  AND  C, with  a PRODUCE  of 
110, 115,  and  120,  and  SUBSEQUENTLY  200, with  RETURNS  of 220,  228 and  235, *the 
relative differences  of the  products will have diminished,  and the  soils will have 
approximated  in fertility, still  the  difference  * of  the AMOUNTS  of their  PRODUCTS  WILL  BE 
INCREASED FROM  5 AND  10 to 8 and 15, and  RENTS  will have risen accordingly. 
* Improvements, therefore, which tend  to approximate  the  degrees  of fertility  of 
the cultivated soils,  may  very well raise rents,*  and  that without  the  cooperation  of 
any other cause"  ([p.]  208).  "The  * turnip  and  sheep husbandry  and the  fresh 
capital employed  to carry  it on,  produced  a greater alteration  in the  fertility  of the 
poor soils than  in that  of the  better; still  it increased  the  absolute produce  of each, 
and,* therefore,  RAISED RENTS,  while  it diminished  the  DIFFERENCES  in the  FERTILITY 
of the  SOILS CULTIVATED"  (I.e.). "With regard  to Ricardo's view that improvements 
may cause rents  to fall,  [it is  only necessary]  *to  remember  the  slowly progressive 
manner  in which agricultural improvements  are  practically discovered, completed 
and spread*"  ([p.] 211). 
//This  last passage  is only  of practical interest  and  does  not 
affect  the  problem  as such,  but  refers only  to the  fact that these 
IMPROVEMENTS  do not proceed so rapidly  AS TO  CONSIDERABLY AUGMENT 
SUPPLY  IN  REGARD  TO  DEMAND  AND  THUS  TO  REDUCE MARKET PRICES.// 
Originally  we  have: 
a) b) c) 
1) 10, 15, 20. The  CAPITAL EMPLOYED  IN  EACH CLASS=100.  The 
PRODUCT=110,  115, 120. The difference = 5 +10= 15. ON  ACCOUNT  of 
improvements  made, twice  as much capital  is employed, [£]200 
instead of 100 IN  EACH CLASS  a), b) and c); but this  CAPITAL  has a 
different effect in the  DIFFERENT CLASSES  and the products 
yielded  = 220 (that  is, double that  of a)), 228 and 235.  Thus: 
a) b) c) 
2) 20, 28, 35. The  CAPITAL EMPLOYED  IN  EACH CLASS=200.  The 
PRODUCT=220,  228 and 235. The difference = 8+15 = 23. But the 
rate  OF  DIFFERENCE  has  been reduced.  5:10 (i.e. [the  ratio  of the 
differences]  b—a [to a] in  l) = '/2 and  10:10=1, whereas 8:20=only 
8/2o= 4/io= 2/6 and  15:20  = 15/2o=3 /4. The  rate  of  difference  has 
declined  but its  AMOUNT  has  increased. This does  not,  however, 
constitute a new law, but only shows that the  INCREASE  OF CAPITAL 
EMPLOYED  leads to an  INCREASE  in RENT  as in the first law, although the 
INCREASE  in a, b, c is not proportional to their  ORIGINAL DIFFERENCES  OF 
22*

FERTILITY.  If prices were to fall as a consequence of this increased 
fertility (which is however [relatively] diminished fertility for b and 
c, for otherwise their product would have to be 230 and 240 
respectively), it would by no means be necessary for the rent to 
rise or even to remain stationary. 
[XVIII-1127] As a consequence, a  SEQUEL,  of the 2nd law, a 
further  APPLICATION  of it can be considered: 
The third law: 
If * "improvements  in the  efficiency  of the  capital employed  in cultivation 
increase  the  surplus profits realised  on particular spots  of land, they increase rent"  * 
[p. 244]. 
The following passages by Jones  (TOGETHER  with the earlier ones) 
refer to this: 
"Thus  the  first source  of a  rise  OF  FARMERS' RENTS  are  *the progressive 
accumulation  and the  unequal effects  of capital  on all  gradations  of soil*"  ([p.] 234). 
//This,  however,  can  only refer  to  IMPROVEMENTS  which  RELATE 
DIRECTLY  TO THE  FERTILITY  OF THE SOIL AS,  FOR  INSTANCE, MANURES, rotation  OF 
CROPS,  etc.// 
* "Improvements  in the  efficiency  of the  capital employed  in cultivation, raise 
rents  by  increasing  the  surplus profits realised  on particular spots  of land.  They 
invariably produce this increase  of surplus profit, unless they augment the mass  of raw 
produce  so rapidly  as to  outstrip  the  progress  of demand. Such improvements  in the 
efficiency  of the  capital employed,  do usually occur  in the  progress  of agricultural 
skill,  and of the  accumulation  of greater masses  of auxiliary capital" * (constant 
capital).  * "A rise  of rents from this cause,  is generally followed  by the  spread  of 
tillage  to inferior  soils,  without  any  decrease  in the  returns  to agricultural capital  on 
the worst spots reclaimed"  * ([p.] 244). 
//Jones very correctly declares that  A FALL  in PROFITS  does not prove 
[the decreasing efficiency of]  AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY  (alias the  FALL  in 
the price of  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE).  But he himself explains most 
inadequately how such a fall can come about. [According to him] 
either the amount produced or  ITS  DIVISION BETWEEN LABOURERS  and 
CAPITALISTS  may  CHANGE.  Jones has as yet no idea of the real law of 
declining rate of profit. 
* "A fall of profits  is no  proof  of the  decreasing efficiency  of agricultural 
industry"  ([p.] 257).  "Profits depend partly  on the  amount  of the  produce  of 
labour, partly  on the  division  of  that produce between  the  labourers  and 
capitalists; *  and  their  AMOUNT,  therefore, might  VARY FROM  A CHANGE  IN EITHER  OF 
THESE PARTICULARS"  ([p.] 260). 
This is the reason for the incorrect law which he elaborates: 
* "When, abstracting from  the  effects  of taxation,  an apparent diminution takes 
place  in the  revenue  of the  producing classes considered jointly" * //what revenue 
means  is not  explained here, [whether]  VALUE  IN  USE or VALUE  IN  EXCHANGE, 
AMOUNT  OF PROFIT  Or  RATE  [of  profit]//, "WHEN THERE  IS A  FALL  IN THE  RATE  OF 

=====第339页=====

PROFITS,  NOT  COMPENSATED  BY A  RISE  OF  WAGES,  and vice versa," //that is precisely 
what Ricardo's law says, and it is wrong//  "THERE HAS BEEN,  it may be argued,  SOME 
DECREASE  IN THE  PRODUCTIVE POWER  OF LABOUR AND CAPITAL"  ([p.] 273). 
Jones correctly grasps that  a relative increase  [in the  value]  of 
* industrial produce  as compared  to [that  of] agricultural producea 
may take place  in the  progress  of society, although,  in point  of 
fact, agriculture  is progressing absolutely.* 
*"In the  progress  of nations,  an increase  of manufacturing power  and  skill 
usually occurs, greater than that which  can be  expected  in the  agriculture  of an 
increasing people. This  is an  unquestionable truth.  A rise in the relative value  of raw 
produce  may,  therefore,  be expected  in the  advance  of nations, without  any  positive 
decrease  in the  efficiency  of agriculture"  * ([p.] 265). 
But this does  not  explain  the  positive rise  in the  money prices  of 
RAW PRODUCE, UnleSS  A  FALL  IN THE  VALUE  OF  GOLD TAKES PLACE which  * in 
manufacture  is balanced  and  overbalanced  by the  still greater fall 
in [the  value  of] the  commodities produced, while  it is not so 
balanced  in agriculture. This  may  happen, even [XVIII-1128]  if 
no general fall  in the value  of gold (money) takes place,  but  when 
a particular nation,  for  instance, buys more money* with  a DAYS 
WORK  than  THE  COMPETING NATIONS  DO. 
Jones explains  his  reasons  for not  believing that  in England  the 
Ricardian  law  operates,  the  abstract possibility  of which  he does 
admit HOWEVER. 
"If rents should ever rise from  the  cause stated  by Mr.  Ricardo, 11 *'the 
employment  of an  additional quantity  of labour with  a proportionally less return', 
and a consequent transfer  to the  landlords  of a  part  of the  produce obtained  on 
the better soils, then  the  average proportion  of the gross produce taken  by the landlords 
as rent, will necessarily increase.* Secondly, c the  * industry  of a  larger proportion 
of the  population must  be devoted  to agriculture*" ([pp.] 280-81). 
(This last statement  is not  quite correct. *  It is  possible that  [a] 
greater portion  of secondary labour  is employed—more com­
modities procured  by industry  and  commerce enter  the  agricultur­
al process, without  the  gross produce being augmented propor­
tionally,  and  without more immediate labour being employed. 
There  may be  even less employed.*) 
"The statistical history  of England presents  to us 3  facts:  *A  spread  of tillage* 
accompanied  *by a  rise in the  general rental  of the country.  A diminution  of the 
proportion  of  people employed  in  agriculture.  A decrease  in the  landlord's 
proportion  of the  produce*"  ([p.] 282).

(This last development, just  as the  decline  in the  rate of profit, 
is due to the  increase  in that part  of the  product which replaces 
constant capital.  At the  same time, rent  can  increase  in both 
AMOUNT  and  value.) 
"Adam Smith says: *  'In the  progress  of improvement, rent, though  it increases 
in [proportion  to the]  extent, diminishes  in proportion  to the  produce  of the 
land'*"  ([p.]  284).a 
Jones calls constant capital  "AUXILIARY CAPITAL". 
"It appears from various  RETURNS  made AT  DIFFERENT TIMES  to the  BOARD  OF 
AGRICULTURE,  that the whole capital  AGRICULTURALLY EMPLOYED  in England, is TO 
THAT  APPLIED  TO THE  SUPPORT  OF LABOURERS,  as 5 to  1 ; that is, there are 4 times as 
much  AUXILIARY CAPITAL USED,  AS THERE  IS OF  CAPITAL APPLIED  TO THE  MAINTENANCE 
OF THE  LABOUR USED DIRECTLY  IN TILLAGE.  In FRANCE, this ratio=2:l"  ([p.] 223). 
* "When  a given quantity  of additional capital  is applied  in the shape  of the results  of 
past labour,  to assist  the  labourers actually employed,  a less annual return will suffice 
to make  the  employment  of  such capital profitable,*  and,  therefore, 
* permanently practicable, than  if the same quantity  of fresh capital were expended 
in the  support  of  additional labourers"  * ([p.] 224).  "Let us  suppose  £100 
EMPLOYED upon  the  Soil  IN THE  MAINTENANCE  OF 3  MEN, PRODUCING THEIR  OWN 
WAGES,  and  10%  profit  on  them,  OR £110.  Let the  capital employed  be doubled. 
And first  let the  fresh capital support  3 additional  LABOURERS.  The  INCREASED 
PRODUCE  must equal £110 = the  WAGES  of 3  ADDITIONAL  MEN+£10  profit. Next let the 
same  ADDITIONAL  £100 be  EMPLOYED  IN THE  SHAPE  OF IMPLEMENTS, MANURES,  OR ANY 
RESULTS  OF PAST  LABOUR,  while the  NUMBER  of ACTUAL LABOURERS  remains the same. 
Let this  AUXILIARY CAPITAL  last on the average 5 years: the  ANNUAL RETURN  to 
repay  the  capitalist must  be 10%  PROFIT,  and £20 the  ANNUAL WEAR  AND TEAR OF HIS 
CAPITAL:  or £30 will be the annual  RETURN,  necessary TO  MAKE  THE  CONTINUOUS 
EMPLOYMENT  of the second £100  PROFITABLE,  instead of £110, THE  AMOUNT 
NECESSARY WHEN DIRECT LABOUR  WAS  EMPLOYED  by IT. It will be obvious, therefore, 
that the  ACCUMULATION  OF AUXILIARY CAPITAL  IN CULTIVATION, WILL  BE PRACTICABLE 
WHEN THE EMPLOYMENT  of the same * amount  of capital  in the support  of additional 
labour  has  ceased  to be  so, and  that  the  accumulation  of such capital  may  go on for 
an indefinite period*" ([pp.] 224-25). "Thus  the  * increase  of auxiliary capital both 
increases  the  command  of man  over  the  powers  of [the]  soil, relatively  to the 
amount  of  [XVIII-1129] labour directly  or indirectly employed upon  it; and 
diminishes  the annual return necessary  to make  the  progressive employment  of given 
quantities  of fresh capital profitable*"  ([p.]  227).  "If we  suppose  any  capital, 
£100  for  instance,  EMPLOYED UPON THE SOIL,  wholly  in paying  the  wages  of labour, 
and  YIELDING  10%  PROFIT,  the revenue of the  FARMER  wiIl='/io that of the 
LABOURERS.  If the capital be trebled, etc., then the  REVENUE  of the  FARMER WILL 
CONTINUE  TO  BEAR  THE  SAME PROPORTION  TO  THAT  OF  THE  LABOURERS.  But if the 
number of labourers remaining the same, the  AMOUNT  OF  CAPITAL  IS DOUBLED, 
PROFITS  become  £20,  or 1/5 of the  revenue.  If the  capital  be quadrupled, profits 
become  £40,  or 2/5 of  the revenue  of the  LABOURERS;  if the  CAPITAL  be increased  to 
£500,  PROFITS  would become £50,  OR  HALF  THE  REVENUE  of the  LABOURERS.  And the 
WEALTH,  the  INFLUENCE,  and  probably  to  some extent,  the  numbers  of the 
CAPITALISTS  IN THE  COMMUNITY, WOULD  BE  PROPORTIONALLY INCREASED...  A great

increase of capital usually makes the  EMPLOYMENT  OF  SOME  ADDITIONAL DIRECT 
LABOUR  necessary.  THIS  CIRCUMSTANCE,  HOWEVER,  WILL  NOT  PREVENT  THE  STEADY 
PROGRESS  OF THE  RELATIVE [increase]  OF THE  AUXILIARY  CAPITAL"  ([pp.]  231-32). 
The first important point  in this passage  is that, with  the 
increase  in capital,  the  AUXILIARY CAPITAL increases  in comparison  to 
the variable capital,  in other words, that  the  latter declines 
relatively  in comparison with  the  constant capital. 
The fact that  the  ANNUAL  RETURNS  decline  in proportion  to the 
capital advanced  if there  is an  increase  in that part  of the  AUXILIARY 
CAPITAL which consists  of fixed capital, that  is, if its  turnover period 
extends over several years—its value only entering into  the 
product annually  in the  form  of depreciation—is  not a  phenome­
non peculiar  to agriculture,  but a  general  one.  Although,  in 
industry,  the raw  material worked  up  during  the  year increases 
even more rapidly than  the  size of the  fixed capital. Compare,  for 
example,  the  amount  of raw  cotton which  A MULE  JENNY  consumes 
weekly  or annually with that used  up by a  spinning wheel.  But 
suppose,  for  example, that  in (large-scale) tailoring  the  same 
amount  of raw  material  in terms  of value.is worked  up (although 
not the  same physical amount,  the raw  material being dearer than 
that used  in spinning), then  the  annual RETURN  in tailoring will  be 
considerably larger than  in spinning, because  a large part  of the 
(fixed) capital laid  out in the  latter only enters into  the  product  as 
annual depreciation. 
The value  of the  annual RETURN  in agriculture (where what  one 
can regard  as the raw  material,  the  seed, does  not  increase  in the 
same proportion  as the  other elements  of constant capital, 
especially fixed capital)  is naturally smaller  if the  capital increases 
as a result  of an  increase  in the  constant capital only  and not in 
the variable.  For the  variable capital must  be entirely replaced  in 
the product,  the  other [constant capital] only  as an  annuity  in so 
far as it is  consumed annually.  If it is  assumed that  the  price  of 
grain  is given, when  a qr=£2,a  220 qrs are  required  to replace  a 
variable capital  of 100 at a  profit  of 10%,  whereas only  60 qrs 
(=£30)  are  required  to replace  a wear  and  tear amounting  to £20 
and a profit  of £10.  A smaller absolute RETURN yields  the  same pro­
fit (as is the  case  in industry  in similar circumstances). Jones' 
reasoning, however, contains several FALLACIES. 
D'abord,  it cannot  be asserted  (on the  assumptions made) that  the 
PRODUCTIVE POWERS  OF THE SOIL have increased. They have increased  in 
comparison with THE LABOUR  EMPLOYED  DIRECTLY, BUT  NOT compared with 
a Thus  in the  manuscript. Presumably,  it should  be "10s.".—  Ed.

THE GENERAL CAPITAL EMPLOYED.  All that can be said is that less  GROSS 
PRODUCE  is necessary in order to yield the same  NET  PRODUCE,  i.e. the 
same profit  as before. 
[XVIII-1130] Further,  the  increase  in the  FARMERS  revenue  in 
comparison  to  that  of the  LABOURERS  is important  in  this special 
sphere  in so far as  here  the  part  of the  total product  WHICH GOES TO 
PROFIT INCREASES AND GOES ON INCREASING RELATIVELY  TO THAT PART WHICH GOES  TO 
THE LABOURERS.  As a result, the  WEALTH  and  INFLUENCE  of the  FARMING 
CAPITALIST  AS COMPARED  TO HIS  LABOURERS  undoubtedly grow and expand. 
But Jones seems  to make  the  following calculation:  [£] 10 on 100 
is Vio- £20 on £120 (i.e. 100  expended  in  labour  and 20 
depreciation) =1/6  and the £20 is Vs of the sum  paid  out to the 
workers,  etc. But  nothing  is more fallacious than that,  GENERALLY 
SPEAKING,  the  rate  of profit  can  increase while  the  amount  of capital 
laid out on  labour declines. Exactly  the  opposite takes place. 
Proportionally less  SURPLUS VALUE  is produced  and the  rate  of profit 
therefore falls.  As  regards  the  FARMER  specifically  (and  also each 
particular enterprise taken  in isolation)  the  rate  of profit  may 
remain  the  same whether  he employs  3 or 6  workers with  a capital 
of 200. 
The fact that rent=suRPLUs  PROFIT,  i.e. the  excess over  and  above 
the AVERAGE PROFIT,  presupposes  not  only that agriculture  is formally 
subordinated  to capitalist production,  but  also that equalisation  of 
rates  of profit takes place  in the  various spheres  of production, 
specifically between agriculture  and  industry. Otherwise rent may  be 
equal  to a  SURPLUS  over  WAGES  (which  is also profit).  It may  even 
represent a  PART  OF PROFIT  or be a  DEDUCTION FROM WAGES.

and into "NET PROFITS OF CAPITAL OR INTEREST"  (CH. IV)  is dealt with  at 
length—is supposed  to have discovered this division, which  was 
already known  in 1821  and  1822,  can be explained only  by the  fact 
that Senior—a mere apologist  of the existing order and consequent­
ly a vulgar economist—is very congenial  to Mr.  Roscher.  // 
By "LABOUR  fund"  Jones understands 
* "the aggregate amount  of the  revenues consumed  by the labourers, whatever 
be the  source  of those revenues"* ([Syllabus,  p.] 44). 
The main point  (the  term LABOUR fund probably comes from 
Malthus? 183)  in Jones' work  is that the  whole economic structure  of 
society revolves around  the  form  of labour,  in other words,  the  form 
in which  the  worker appropriates  his  means  of subsistence,  or that 
part of his pv oduct  UPON  WHICH  HE LIVES.  This LABOUR fund  has  various 
forms  and  capital  is merely  one  of them,  it is a  form which arises 
rather late  in the  historical development.  It is  only in Jones' work 
that the  important differentiation—between labour that  is paid 
out of capital  and  labour paid directly  out of  revenue—made  by 
Adam Smith receives  the  full elaboration  of which  it is  capable  and 
becomes  a major  key for  understanding  the  various economic 
structures  of society.  And  with  it disappears  the  absurd notion 
that, because  in capital  the  worker's revenue first takes  the  form  of 
something appropriated, alias  saved,  by the capitalist, this signifies 
more than  a formal difference. 
"Even among  the  West European  NATIONS  we still find  the  EFFECTS  of the * soci­
al conformation which results from  the  peculiar mode  of distributing  the  produce 
of their land  and  labour, established [XVIII-1131]  in the early period  of the exis­
tence  of agricultural nations* //namely  A CLASS OF AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS,  second­
ly LANDLORDS,  thirdly  MENIALS, RETAINERS  and  ARTISANS  who participate in the 
consumption  of the  REVENUE  of the  LANDLORDS  either directly  or indirectly//"  ([An 
Introductory Lecture,  p.] 16).  "Capital, that  is, ACCUMULATED WEALTH EMPLOYED  WITH 
A VIEW  TO  PROFIT  is the  GREAT AGENT,  the motive  POWER  which causes the  CHANGES 
that take place  in THIS ECONOMIC CONFORMATION".  ... "Among  all NATIONS,  you  will 
find  THE DISTINCT DIVISION OF WEALTH HERE POINTED OUT,  acting  * a most important 
part in modifying  the  ties which connect  the  different classes  of the  community, 
and in determining their productive power...*  In Asia  and  in part of Europe  (it was 
formerly  the  case throughout Europe)  the  HONAGRICULTURAL CLASSES  are 
almost wholly maintained from  the  INCOMES  of the other CLASSES, principally from 
the incomes  of the  * landholders.  If you  want  the  labour 
of an  artisan,  you  provide  him  with materials;  he comes  to your house,  you  feed 
and pay him his  wages. After  a time,  the  capitalist steps  in, he  provides  the 
materials,  he advances  the wages  of the workman,  he becomes  his employer,  and  is the owner 
of the article produced, which  he exchanges  for  your money  ... an  intermediate class  * 
appears between  the  LANDOWNERS  and  a portion  of the  NON-AGRICULTURISTS,  upon 
which * intermediate class those non-agriculturists  are  dependent  for  employ­
ment  and  subsistence.  The  ties which formerly bound  the  community together  are 
worn  out and  fall to pieces; other bonds, other principles  of cohesion, connect  its

different classes:  new  economical relations spring into being,  etc. ...*  Here  in 
England  not  only  the  * great body  of non-agriculturists almost wholly depend  on 
the pay of  capitalists,  but the  labouring cultivators  of the  soil are  their servants 
too*"  ([p.] 16  sqq.). 
The Syllabus  of a  Course  of  Lectures  on the  Wages  of  Labor differs 
from  the  book  ON  RENT  in this:  The  book examines  the  different 
forms  of  landed property  to  which different  SOCIAL FORMS  OF LABOUR 
correspond.  In the  Syllabus, these  DIFFERENT FORMS  OF  LABOUR  are the 
point  of  departure  and  both  the  different forms  of  landed 
property  and  CAPITAL  are  regarded  as  their  OFFSPRING.  The  determi­
nate social form  of the  worker's labour corresponds  to the  form 
which  the  conditions  of  labour—that  is, in  particular,  the  land, 
nature, since this relationship embraces  all  others—assume  in 
respect  of the  worker.  But the  former  is in  fact merely  the 
objective expression  of the  latter. 
We shall  see,  therefore, that  the  different forms  of the  LABOUR 
fund correspond  to the  different ways  in  which  the  worker 
confronts  his own  conditions  of  production.  The  manner  in which 
he appropriates  his  product  (or  part  of it)  depends  on his  relations 
to his  conditions  of  production. 
"The  LABOUR  fund," says Jones,  "may  be divided into  3 classes:  1) REVENUES 
which  are  produced  by the  LABOURERS  who  consume them,  and  never belong  to 
any other persons"  //in  this case, quite irrespective  of the  particular form,  the 
worker must  in fact be the  owner  of his instruments  of production//;  2) "REVENUES 
BELONGING  TO  CLASSES DISTINCT FROM  THE  LABOURERS,  AND  EXPENDED  BY THOSE 
CLASSES  IN THE  DIRECT  MAINTENANCE  OF LABOUR";  3) "Capital  in its  proper sense. 
These  DISTINCT BRANCHES  of the  LABOUR  fund  may all be  observed  IN  OUR OWN 
COUNTRY;  but  WHEN  WE  LOOK ABROAD,  WE SEE  THOSE PARTS  of that fund, which are 
the most limited here,  CONSTITUTING ELSEWHERE  THE  MAIN SOURCES  OF  SUBSISTENCE 
TO THE  POPULATION  AND  DETERMINING  THE  CHARACTER  AND  POSITION  OF THE 
MAJORITY  OF  THE PEOPLE,  etc."  ([pp.] 45-46). 
Ad a). "The  WAGES  OF  LABOURING CULTIVATORS,  OR  OCCUPYING PEASANTS.  These 
LABOURING CULTIVATORS  OR  PEASANTS  are  HEREDITARY OCCUPIERS, PROPRIETORS, 
TENANTS.  The  TENANTS  are  SERFS, METAYERS, COTTIERS.  The last peculiar to Ireland. 
Something resembling  RENT  or profit  is often mixed  up  with  the  REVENUES  of 
PEASANT CULTIVATORS  OF ALL CLASSES,  but  WHEN THEIR SUBSISTENCE  IS ESSENTIALLY 
DEPENDENT  ON THE  REWARD  OF  THEIR  MANUAL  LABOUR,  they  may be  regarded  as 
WAGE LABOURERS. 
"Thus,  among  the  LABOURING PEASANTS  there  are: 
"a) HEREDITARY OCCUPIERS,  WHO ARE  LABOURING  [XVIII-1132]  CULTIVATORS. 
ANCIENT GREECE. MODERN ASIA,  more especially  INDIA. 
"ß) PROPRIETORS. FRANCE, GERMANY, AMERICA, AUSTRALIA,  Ancient Palestine. 
"y) COTTIERS"  ([Syllabus,  pp.]  46-48). 
The characteristic feature  [of  these groups]  is that  the  worker 
reproduces  the  LABOUR  fund  for  himself.  It is not  transformed into 
capital. Just  as the  worker directly produces  the  labour fund,  so he 
appropriates  it  directly, although  his  SURPLUS LABOUR  may be

appropriated either wholly or in part by him himself or may be 
appropriated entirely by other classes, depending on the particular 
form which his relation to his conditions of production assumes. It 
is entirely due to economic prejudice that Jones describes this 
category as WAGE LABOURERS. Nothing which characterises WAGE 
LABOURERS exists amongst them. It is a pretty bourgeois economic 
fancy that, because that part of the product which the worker 
appropriates to himself under capitalism appears as  WAGES,  the part 
of his product which the worker himself consumes must be WAGES. 
Ad b. "In England [the labourers are] limited to * menial servants, soldiers, 
sailors,* and * a few artisans working on their own account, and paid out of the incomes 
of their employers. Over a considerable portion of the earth this branch of the 
General Labour Fund maintains nearly the whole of the non-agricultural labourers. 
Former prevalence of this Fund in England. Warwick the king-maker.184 The 
English gentry. Present prevalence in the East. Mechanics, menials. Large bodies of 
troops so maintained. Consequences of the concentration of this Fund throughout

Samarcand; Candahar and others*" ([pp.] 48-49). 
Jones overlooks two main forms: The Asiatic communal system 
with its unity of agriculture and industry. And secondly, the urban 
craft guild system of the Middle Ages, [which] also existed 
partially in the Ancient World. 
Ad c. * " Capital should never be confounded with the General Labour Fund of 
the World, of which a large proportion consists of revenues. All branches of a 
nation's revenues ... contribute to the accumulations by which capital is formed. 
They contribute in different proportions in different countries and different stages 
of society. When wages and rents contribute the most" * ([p.] 49 sqq.). 
Because SURPLUS LABOUR is converted into capital (instead of being 
exchanged directly as revenue for labour), capital seems to appear 
as something saved out of revenue. Jones considers it mainly from 
this point of view. And in THE  PROGRESS  OF SOCIETY the great mass of 
capital does, in fact, consist of revenue reconverted in this way. 
But in the capitalist production the original LABOUR FUND itself 
likewise appears as something saved by the capitalist. The 
reproduced LABOUR FUND does not remain in the possession of the 
worker as in case a), but appears as the property of the capitalist 
and confronts the worker as the property of someone  else.  And this 
POINT  is not elaborated by Jones. 
What Jones has to say about the RATE  OF PROFITS  and its influence 
on accumulation in the  COURSE  [of Lectures] is rather inadequate: 
* "All other things being equal, the power of a nation to save from its profits varies 
with the rate of profits: is great when they are high, less when low; but as the rate of 
profits declines, all other things do not remain equal. The quantities of capital employed 
relatively to the numbers of [the] population may increase." * 

=====第346页=====
336 Theories  of Surplus Value 
//What Jones does not understand is how, as a result of the 
*"may" increase, the rate of profit sinks because "the quantities 
of capital employed relatively to the numbers of [the] population have 
increased".* But he approaches close to the correct view.// 
* "Inducements  and  facilities  to accumulate  may  increase...  A low rate of profit  is 
ordinarily accompanied  by a  rapid rate  of accumulation, relatively  to the  numbers  of 
[the] people  as in  England;  * and a *  high rate  of profit  by a  slower rate  of 
accumulation, [XVIII-1133] relatively  to the  numbers  of [the]  people,*  as in 
Poland, Russia, India,  etc." ([p.] 50  sqq.). 
Where the rate of profit is high (apart from cases where, as in 
North America, there is capitalist production on the one hand 
and, on the other hand, the  VALUE OF ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE  is LOW)  it 
is GENERALLY  due to the fact that capital consists  PRINCIPALLY  of 
variable capital, that is, direct labour predominates. Assume a 
capital of 100, of which Vs is variable capital. And assume further 
that the  SURPLUS LABOUR  amounts to Vs of a working day. In this case, 
profit=10%. Assume that 4/s [of the capital] consists of variable 
capital and that  SURPLUS LABOUR='/6  of the working day. In this case, 
profit would=16%. 
"ERROR  of the  DOCTRINE,  that whenever,  in the  progress  OF NATIONS,  the *  rate of 
profits declines,  the  means  of providing subsistence  for an  increasing population 
must  be  becoming less. Foundations  of this error:  1) A  mistaken notion, that 
accumulation from profits must  be slow where  the  rate  of profits  is low, and  rapid 
where  it is  high.  2) A  mistaken  belief,  that profits  are the  only source  of 
accumulation.  3) A  mistaken belief that  all the  labourers  of the  earth subsist  on 
accumulations  and  savings from revenue,  and  never  on revenue  itself"  (I.e.). 
"Alterations which take place  in the  economical structure  of nations when 
capital assumes  the task of advancing the wages  of labour...  The  amount  of capital 
devoted  to the  maintenance  of  labour  may  vary, independently 
of any  changes  in the  whole amount  of capital."* //This proposition  is 
important.//  * "...Great fluctuations  in the  amount  of employment,  and  great 
suffering,  may  sometimes  be observed  to become more frequent  as  capital itself 
becomes  more plentiful  ... Periods  of gradual transition  of the labourers  from dependence  on 
one fund  to dependence  on another... Transfer  of the  labouring cultivators  to the pay of 
capitalists... Transfer  of non-agricultural classes  to the  employ  of capitalists" * (I.e.). 
What Jones calls  "TRANSFER"  here, is what I call "primitive 
accumulation". This is merely a formal difference. It is also in 
contradiction to the absurd notion of  "SAVINGS". 
* "Slavery. Slaves  may be  divided into pastoral—praedial—domestic—slaves  of a 
mixed character, between praedial  and  domestic*  We  find  SLAVES  as CULTIVATING 
PEASANTS,  as * menials  or artisans, maintained from  the  incomes  of the  rich,  as 
labourers maintained from capital  " * ([p.] 59). 
But so long as slavery is predominant, the capital-relation can 
only be sporadic and subordinate, never dominant.

ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF NATIONS, HERTFORD, 1852 ,M 
* "The productiveness of the industry of nations really depends on 2 
circumstances: First, on the fertility or barrenness of the original  sources^'  //land and 
water// "of the wealth they produce. Secondly, on the efficiency of the labour they 
apply in dealing with those sources, or fashioning the commodities obtained from 
them" ([p.] 4). 
"The efficiency of human labour will depend: 1) on the continuity with which it is 
exerted; 2) on the knowledge and skill with which it is applied, to effect the purpose 
of the producer; 3) on the mechanical power by which it is aided" ([p.] 6). 
"The power exerted by human labourers in producing wealth ... may be 
increased: 1) by enlisting in their service, motive forces greater than their own..., 
2) by employing any amount or kind of motive [XVIII-1134] forces at their 
command with an increased mechanical advantage.* For example, an  ENGINE OF  40 
HORSEPOWER on a railway has a different effect to one on a TURNPIKE  ROAD"  ([p.] 8). 
* "The best form of a plough will do as much work, and as well, with two horses, as 
the worst with four" ([p.] 9). 
"The steam engine is not a mere tool, it gives additional motive force, not merely 
the means of using forces the labourer already possesses, with a greater mechanical 
advantage" * ([p.] 10, note). 
This is, therefore, according to Jones, the difference between a 
TOOL  and  MACHINERY.  The former provides the worker with means for 
employing the power he possesses to a greater mechanical 
advantage, the latter provides an increase of MOTIVE FORCE. (?) 
* "Capital ... consists of wealth saved from revenue, and used with a view to profit" 
([p.] 16). "The possible sources of capital ... are obviously all the revenues of all the 
individuals composing a community, from which revenues it is possible that any 
saving can be made. The particular classes of income which yield the most 
abundantly to the progress of national capital, change at different stages of their 
progress, and are therefore found entirely different in nations occupying different 
positions in that progress"* (I.e.). "PROFITS are therefore FAR FROM BEING  THE ONLY 
SOURCES  FROM WHICH CAPITAL IS FORMED OR  INCREASED.  It is even an UNIMPORTANT 
SOURCE  OF ACCUMULATION,  compared with  WAGES  and * rents, in the earlier stages of 
society" ([p.J 20). "When a considerable advance in the powers of national industry 
has actually taken place, profits rise into comparative importance as a source of 
accumulation"* ([p.] 21). 
According to this, capital is a part of the  WEALTH  which constitutes 
revenue, the part which is expended not as revenue but for the 
purpose of producing profit. Profit is already a form of surplus 
value which specifically presupposes capital. If the capitalist mode 
of production, i.e. capital, is postulated, then the explanation is 
correct; in other words, if one postulates what has to be explained. 
But here Jones means all revenue SPENT,  NOT AS  REVENUE,  but with the 
aim of enrichment, that is, PRODUCTIVELY. 
Two aspects are, however, important in this context: First: To a 
certain extent accumulation of wealth takes place in all stages of 
economic development, that is, partly an expansion of the scale of

production  and  partly,  the  accumulation  of treasure,  etc. As  long 
as WAGES  and  RENT  predominate  — that is, according  to what  was  said 
earlier,  as long  as the  greater part  of the  SURPLUS LABOUR  and  SURPLUS 
PRODUCE  which does  not  accrue  to the  worker  himself,  goes  to the 
landowner  (the  State  in Asia)  and, on the  other hand,  the  worker 
reproduces  his  LABOUR  fund  himself,  i.e. he not  only produces  his 
own  WAGES  himself,  but  pays them  to himself,  usually, moreover 
(almost always  IN THAT STATE OF SOCIETY),  he is  also able  to appropriate 
AT LEAST  a part of his  SURPLUS LABOUR  and his  SURPLUS PRODUCT—in  this 
state  of society,  WAGES  and  RENT  are the  main sources  of accumula­
tion as  well.  (In  these circumstances profit  is  restricted  to 
merchants,  etc.)  Only when  the  capitalist production  has  become 
predominant, when  it does  not  merely exist sporadically,  but has 
subordinated  to itself  the  mode  of production  of society; when  IN 
FACT  the capitalist  DIRECTLY APPROPRIATES  THE  WHOLE SURPLUS LABOUR  AND 
SURPLUS  PRODUCE  IN THE  FIRST  INSTANCE,  ALTHOUGH HE HAS TO PAY  AWAY  PORTIONS  OF 
IT TO THE LANDOWNER,  etc.— only then does profit become  the  PRINCIPAL 
SOURCE  OF CAPITAL,  OF ACCUMULATION,  OF WEALTH SAVED  FROM  REVENUE, AND  USED 
WITH  A VIEW  TO  PROFIT.  This  at the  same time presupposes  (as is 
implicit  in the  domination  of the  capitalist mode  of production) 
that "A  CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE  IN THE  POWERS  OF  NATIONAL INDUSTRY  HAS 
ACTUALLY  TAKEN PLACE". 
Jones thus answers those asses  who  imagine that  no  accumula­
tion can  take place without  the  profit yielded  by  capital  or who 
justify profit  by  saying that  the  capitalist makes  a sacrifice  in order 
TO SAVE  FROM  his  REVENUE FOR PRODUCTIVE PURPOSES,186  by pointing out that 
in this particular (capitalist) mode  of production  the  function "OF 
ACCUMULATING"  devolves principally  on the  capitalist whereas,  in 
previous modes  of production,  it was the  labourer himself  and,  in 
part,  the  LANDLORD  who  played  the  chief roles  in this process  and 
profit played hardly  any  part  in it.  Naturally  the  function  [of 
accumulating] always devolves  1) on  those  who  pocket  the  SURPLUS 
VALUE  and, 2)  among those  who  pocket  the  SURPLUS  VALUE,  in particular 
on the  person  who  also acts  as agent  in the  production process 
itself.  By  saying, [XVIII-1135] therefore, that profit  is justified 
by the  fact that  the  capitalist  "SAVES" HIS CAPITAL  out of  PROFIT  and 
that he  fulfils  the  function  of  accumulating,  one  merely says 
that the  capitalist mode  of  production  is  justified because  it 
exists—this, however, applies equally  to the  modes  of  produc­
tion which preceded  it and  those which will succeed  it. If one 
says that otherwise accumulation would  be  impossible, then  one 
forgets that this particular method  of  accumulation  THROUGH 
THE AGENCY  OF THE  CAPITALIST  has  come into existence  at a  certain

historical stage  and is  moving towards  the  historical date when  it 
will cease  to exist. 
Secondly, once  so much  ACCUMULATED WEALTH  has  been concentrated 
in the  hands  of capitalists  per fas et nefas* that they  can  dominate 
production, then  the  greater part  OF EXISTING CAPITAL  — AFTER  A CERTAIN 
LAPSE  OF  TIME  — can BE  CONSIDERED  AS  MERELY ORIGINATING  FROM  PROFIT  (RE­
VENUE),  that  is,  from capitalised surplus value. 
A point which Jones does  not  sufficiently emphasise,  and  which 
he really only implies tacitly,  is this:  If the  LABOURING PRODUCER  pays 
himself  his own  WAGES  and  if his  product does  not at  first assume 
the "SHAPE"  of OTHER PEOPLE'S REVENUE  FROM  which  "SAVINGS"  are made 
AND THEN  PAID  BACK  BY  THEM  TO THE  LABOURER,  it is necessary that 
the labourer  be in  possession  of his  conditions  of production  (as 
property owner,  or  TENANT,  or  HEREDITARY OCCUPIER,  etc.).  In  order 
that his  WAGES  and  consequently  the  LABOUR FUND  can confront  him as 
alien capital, these conditions  of production must have been lost  to 
him and  have assumed  the  SHAPE  OF alien  PROPERTY.  Only after  his 
conditions  of production together with  his  LABOUR FUND  have been 
wrested from  him and  when,  as  capital, they  are  rendered 
independent  in relation  to him,  does  the  further process begin, 
which  is not  concerned with  the  mere reproduction  of  these 
original conditions  of production,  but  with their further develop­
ment  so that both  the  conditions  of production  and  the  LABOUR FUND 
confront  the  labourer  as  something  "SAVED" FROM  OTHER  PEOPLE'S 
REVENUE  IN ORDER TO BE  CONVERTED  INTO  CAPITAL.  By losing possession of his 
conditions  of  production,  and  hence,  of his  LABOUR FUND,  the 
labourer also loses  the  function  of  accumulating,  and  every 
addition  he  makes  to wealth appears  in  THE SHAPE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S 
REVENUE  which  MUST  FIRST  BE "SAVED"  BY THOSE  PEOPLE, THAT IS TO  SAY,  NOT SPENT 
AS REVENUE,[if  it is]  TO  PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF CAPITAL AND LABOUR FUND  for 
the LABOURER. 
Since Jones himself describes  a state  of affairs  in which things 
have  not yet  reached this stage  and  where unity prevails,  he 
certainly should have described this "separation"  as the  real 
generation process  of  capital. Once this separation exists, this 
process does indeed take place  and it is  CONTINUED  and  extended, 
since  the  SURPLUS LABOUR  of the  worker always confronts  him as the 
revenue  of others, through  the  "SAVING"  of which alone wealth  can 
be ACCUMULATED  and the  scale  of production extended.

the source  of profit  //i.e.  of the  fact that  SURPLUS LABOUR  appears  as 
the revenue  of capital  and not of  labour// then profit becomes  the 
source  of capital,  of new  capital formation,  i.e. of the  fact that  the 
ADDITIONAL  conditions  of production confront  the  worker  as capital, 
as a means  for  maintaining  him as a  worker  and of  appropriating 
his SURPLUS LABOUR  anew.  The  original unity between  the  worker  and 
the conditions  of  labour //abstracting from slavery, where  the 
labourer himself belongs  to the  objective conditions  of labour//  has 
two main forms:  the  Asiatic communal system (primitive commun­
ism) and  small-scale agriculture based  on the  family  (and  linked 
with domestic industry)  IN ONE OR THE OTHER FORM.  Both  are  embryonic 
forms  and  both  are  equally unfitted  to  develop labour  as social 
labour  and the  productive power  of  social labour. Hence  the 
necessity  for the  separation,  for the  rupture,  for the  antithesis  of 
labour  and  property  (by  which property  in the  conditions  of 
production  is to be  understood).  The  most extreme form  of this 
rupture, and the one in which the  PRODUCTIVE FORCES OF SOCIAL LABOUR 
ARE also  MOST POWERFULLY DEVELOPED,  is capital.  The  original unity  can 
be re-established only  on the  material foundation which capital 
creates  and by  means  of the  revolutions which,  in the  process  of 
this creation,  the  working class  and  THE WHOLE SOCIETY UNDERGO. 
Another point which Jones does  not  sufficiently emphasise  is 
this: 
Revenue which  is exchanged  as such against labour—if  it is not 
the revenue  of a  SELF-SUSTAINING LABOURER  who  employs  a SECONDARY 
WORKMAN—is  the  revenue  of the  LANDHOLDER,  itself derived from  the 
rent which  the  SELF-SUSTAINING LABOURER  pays  him, and  which  the 
landlord does  not  entirely consume  in natura, either  by  himself  or 
together with  his  MENIALS  and  RETAINERS,  but a  part  of which  he  uses 
to buy the  products  or  services  of secondary  WORKMEN  and so on. 
This always presupposes  the  first relationship. 
[XVIII-1136]  //In the  same  way  as part  of the  profit  is classified 
as interest,  EVEN  IF THE  INDUSTRIAL  CAPITALIST  EMPLOYS ONLY  HIS  OWN CAPITAL, 
because this form  [of  revenue]  has a  separate mode  of existence, 
so, given  the  capitalist mode  of production,  EVEN  IF A LABOURER  OWNS  HIS 
MEANS  OF  PRODUCTION, EVEN WITHOUT EMPLOYING  ANY  OTHER LABOURER,  IT IS 
CONSIDERED AS CAPITAL  and the  part  of his own  labour realised  by him 
au delà 3 the  common  WAGE  appears  to be  PROFIT  yielded  by his 
capital.  He  himself  is then divided  up  into  DIFFERENT  economic 
categories. As  HIS OWN WORKMAN, HE  GETS  HIS  WAGES,  AND AS  CAPITALIST,  HE GETS 
HIS PROFITS.  This observation belongs  to the  chapter  "REVENUE AND  ITS 
SOURCES". 187//

* "There  is a  difference between  the  influence,  on the  productive powers  of 
nations,  of that wealth which  has  been  saved,  and is  dispensed  as wages with  a view  to 
profit;  and of  that wealth which  is advanced  out of  revenue  for the  support  of 
labour. With  a view  to this distinction,  I use the  word capital  to denote that portion 
of wealth exclusively which  has  been saved from revenue,  and is  used with  a view 
to profit" ([pp.] 36-37).  "We  might  ... comprise under  the  term capital,  all the 
wealth devoted  to the  maintenance  of labour, whether  is has  gone through  any  previous 
process  of saving  or not, ...we  must, then,  in tracing  the  position  of the  labouring 
classes,  and of  their paymasters  in  different nations  and  under different 
circumstances, distinguish between capital which  has  been  saved,  and  capital which  has 
undergone  no process  of accumulation; between,  in short, capital which  is revenue,  and 
capital which  is not  revenue"  ([p.] 36). "In  every nation  of the Old  World, except 
England  and  Holland,  the  wages  of the  agriculturists  are not  advanced  out of the 
funds which have been saved  and  accumulated from revenues,  but are  produced  by the 
labourers themselves,  and  never exist  in any  other shape than that  of a  stock  for their  own 
immediate consumption"  * ([p.] 37). 
What  distinguishes Jones from  the  other economists (except 
perhaps  Sismondi)  is that  he emphasises that  the  essential feature 
of capital  is its  socially determined form,  and  that  he reduces  the 
whole  difference between  the  capitalist  and  other modes  of 
production  to  this distinct form.  It is  that labour  is directly 
converted  into capital  and  that,  on the  other hand, this capital 
buys  labour  not for the  sake  of its use  value,  but in  order  to 
valorise  itself,  to create surplus value  (a larger amount  of exchange 
value) and to use it  "WITH  A VIEW  TO PROFIT". 
This shows, however,  at the  same time that  the  "SAVING  OF 
REVENUE"  in order  to convert  it into capital  and  "accumulation"  are 
distinguished  from other methods only through  the  form  in which 
"WEALTH  IS DEVOTED  TO  THE  MAINTENANCE  OF  LABOUR".  The  AGRICULTURAL 
LABOURERS  in England and Holland who receive  WAGES  which are 
"ADVANCED"  by capital  PRODUCE "THEIR WAGES THEMSELVES"  just like the 
French  PEASANT  OR THE  SELF-SUSTAINING RUSSIAN SERF.  If the production 
process  is considered  in its  continuity, then  the  capitalist advances 
the LABOURER  as "WAGES"  today only  a part  of the  product which  the 
LABOURER  "produced" yesterday. Thus  the  difference [between  the 
capitalist  and  other modes  of production] does  not lie in the  fact 
that, in one  case,THE  LABOURER DOES PRODUCE HIS OWN WAGES AND IN THE OTHER 
[case]  DOES NOT PRODUCE THEM.  The difference lies in the fact that [in 
one case]  his  product appears  as  WAGES;  that  in  this case,  the 
worker's  product  (the  part  of the  product produced  by the  worker 
which makes up the  LABOUR FUND)  1) appears as the revenue of 
others;  2) that then, however,  it is not  expended  as revenue,  and 
not spent  on  labour  by  means  of  which revenue  is directly 
consumed,  but, 3)  that  it confronts  the  worker  as capital which 
returns  to him  this portion  of the  product,  in exchange  not  merely 
23-613 

=====第352页=====
342 Theories  of Surplus Value 
for an  equivalent  but for  more  LABOUR  than  is objectified  in the 
product. Thus  his  product appears  1) as  revenue  of others,  2) as 
something which is  "SAVED"  FROM  REVENUE  IN ORDER  TO BE EMPLOYED  IN THE 
PURCHASE  OF LABOUR WITH  A VIEW  TO PROFIT,  i.e. as capital. 
And this process  in which  his own  product confronts  him as 
capital,  is described  in the  following  way: the  LABOUR FUND HAS CONE 
"THROUGH  A PREVIOUS  PROCESS  OF  SAVING",  "HAS  UNDERGONE  A PROCESS  OF 
ACCUMULATION",  and prior  TO  BEING CONVERTED INTO THE LABOURERS MEANS OF 
SUBSISTENCE,  it "EXISTS IN ANOTHER SHAPE"  (here  it is  expressly stated that 
merely  a change  of form takes place)  "THAN THAT  OF A STOCK  FOR THE 
LABOURERS IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION".  The  whole difference lies  in the 
transformation which  the  LABOUR FUND  produced  by the  worker 
undergoes before  it comes back  to him  in the  form  of WAGES.  In the 
CASE of SELF-SUSTAINING PEASANTS  or independent artisans,  it therefore 
never assumes  the  form  of  "WAGES". 
[XVIII-1137]  "SAVING"  and  "accumulation"—AS  FAR AS THE LABOUR 
FUND is CONCERNED—are  mere names here  for the  transformations 
which  the  worker's product undergoes.  The  SELF-SUSTAINING LABOURER 
consumes  his  product just like  the  WAGE LABOURER,  or  rather,  the 
latter does  so  just like  the  former.  But in the  case  of the  wage 
earner,  his  product appears  to be  SOMETHING SAVED OR ACCUMULATED FROM 
[the revenue of]  OTHERS, THE CAPITALISTS REVENUE.  In FACT,  however, it 
is this process that makes  it possible  for the  capitalist  "TO  SAVE"  OR 
"ACCUMULATE"  THE LABOURER'S SURPLUS LABOUR  for HIS own purposes, and 
this is the  reason  why  Jones places such great emphasis  on the  fact 
that,  in non-capitalist modes  of production,  ACCUMULATION  does  not 
arise  FROM PROFITS,  but  from  WAGES,  in other words, from  the  income 
of the  SELF-SUSTAINING CULTIVATOR  or the  artisan  who  exchanges  his 
labour directly  for  revenue (otherwise  how  could  the  MIDDLE CLASSES 
have arisen  out of the  latter?)  and  from  the  LANDLORD'S RENT.  But  for 
the LABOUR FUND  to undergo these transformations,  the  conditions  of 
production must confront  the  labourer  as capital, which  is not the 
case in other forms.  The  expansion  of  WEALTH  does  not  appear  to 
be due to the  LABOURER  in the  latter case,  but to the  SAVING  of profit, 
the reconversion  of surplus value into capital,  in the  same  way  as 
the LABOUR FUND  itself (before  its  expansion  as a  result  of new 
accumulation) confronts  the  labourer  as capital. 
"SAVING",  taken literally, only makes sense with regard  to the 
capitalist  who  capitalises  his  revenue,  in contrast  to the  capitalist 
who consumes  his  revenue,  i.e.  SPENDS  it AS REVENUE,  but  makes  NO 
SENSE WHATEVER  when applied  to  relations  BETWEEN CAPITALIST  AND 
LABOURER. 
Two cardinal  FACTS  about capitalist production: [First,] concentra-

tion of the means of production in a few hands so that they no 
longer appear as the immediate property of the individual 
labourer, but as factors of social production, even though in the 
first instance they appear as the property of the non-working 
capitalists, who are their TRUSTEES in bourgeois society and enjoy all 
the fruits of this TRusTEEship. Second: Organisation of labour itself 
as social labour brought about by cooperation, division of labour 
and the linking of labour with the results of social domination 
over natural forces. In both these ways, capitalist production 
eliminates private property and private labour, even though as yet 
in antagonistic forms. 
The main difference between productive and unproductive 
labour noted by Adam Smith, is that the former is exchanged 
directly for capital and the latter for revenue—and the full 
meaning of this difference emerges first in Jones. His work shows 
that the first kind of labour is characteristic of the capitalist mode 
of production, and the second—where it is predominant—belongs 
to earlier modes of production, and, where it merely plays a 
subordinate role, is restricted (or ought to be restricted) to spheres 
which are not directly concerned with the production of wealth. 
* " Capital is the instrument through which all the causes which augment the 
efficiency of human labour, and the productive power of nations, are brought into 
play... Capital is the stored-up results of past labour used to produce some effect in 
some part of the task of producing wealth" * [p. 35]. 
(In Note, ib., PAGE 35, he says: 
* "It will be convenient, and it is reasonable, to consider the act of production as 
incomplete till the commodity produced has been placed in the hands of the 
person who is to consume it; all done previously has that point in view. The 
grocer's horse and cart which brings up our tea from Hertford to the College, is as 
essential to our possession of it for the purpose of consumption as the labour of 
the Chinese who picked and dried the leaves.") 
"But ... this capital ... does not perform in every community all the tasks it is 
capable of performing. It takes them up gradually and successively in all cases; and it 
is a remarkable and an all-important fact, that the one special function, the performance 
of which is essential to the serious advance of the power of capital in all its other 
functions, is exactly that which, in the case of the greater portion of the labourers of 
mankind, capital has never yet fulfilled at all" ([pp.] 35-36). "I allude to the advance of 
the wages of labour" ([p.] 36). "The wages of labour are advanced by capitalists in 
the case of less than one-fourth of the labourers of the earth." "This fact ... of vital 
importance in accounting for the comparative progress of nations" (I.e.). 
[XVIII-1138] "Capital, or accumulated stock, after performing various other 
functions in the production of wealth, only takes up late that of advancing to the 
labourer his wages" * ([p.] 79). 
In the last sentence on PAGE 79, capital is indeed described as a 
"relation", not merely as "ACCUMULATED  STOCK"  but as a quite definite 
23* 

=====第354页=====
344 Theories  of Surplus Value 
relation  of production.  The  "STOCK"  cannot  "TAKE UP THE FUNCTION OF 
ADVANCING WAGES".  Jones, moreover, emphasises that  it is the  basic 
form of  capital—the form which gives  the  whole process  of social 
production  its  distinctive character, dominates  it, leads  to a  quite 
new development  of the  productive powers  of social labour,  and 
revolutionises  all  social  and  political relationships—that confronts 
wage labour,  and  pays  WAGES.  He  emphasises that before capital 
performs this function, which  is of  decisive importance,  it fulfils 
other functions  and  appears  in other, subordinate  and  historically 
earlier forms,  but  that  its  POWER  IN ALL ITS  FUNCTIONS  only develops 
fully when  it steps forth  as industrial capital.  On the  other hand, 
in LECTURE  III "ON  THE  GRADUAL  MANNER  IN WHICH  CAPITAL  OR  CAPITALISTS" 
//there's  the rub in  this  OR ; ACCUMULATED STOCK  becomes capital only 
because  of this personification//  "UNDERTAKE SUCCESSIVE FUNCTIONS IN THE 
PRODUCTION  OF WEALTH",3  Jones does  not  indicate what  the  previous 
FUNCTIONS  are.  They  can  indeed only  be those  of capital engaged  in 
commerce  or  banking.  But  although Jones comes  so close  to the 
correct concept  and  even expresses  it in a  certain fashion, 
nevertheless, being  an  economist,  he is so  enmeshed  in bourgeois 
fetishism that  not  even  the  devil could  be  certain that  he  does  not 
mean that  "ACCUMULATED STOCK"  as  such  can  perform different 
FUNCTIONS. 
The sentence: 
* "Capital,  or accumulated  stock,  after performing various other functions  in the 
production  of wealth, only takes  up late that  of advancing  to the  labourer  his 
wages"  * ([p.]  79) 
is the  most complete expression  of the  contradiction;  on the one 
hand,  it expresses  a correct historical conception  of capital,  but, on 
the other hand,  a shadow  is cast over  it by the  narrow-minded 
notion  of the  economist that  "STOCK"  as such  is "capital". Hence 
"THE  ACCUMULATED  STOCK"  becomes a person who  "TAKES  UP THE  FUNCTION 
OF ADVANCING WAGES"  TO  MEN.  Jones  is  still rooted  in  economic 
prejudice when  he  solves  [the  problem],  a solution becomes 
necessary  as soon  as the  capitalist mode  of production  is regarded 
as a determinate historical category  and no  longer  as an  eternal 
natural relation  of production. 
One can see  what  a great leap forward there  was  from Ramsay 
to Jones. Ramsay regards precisely that  FUNCTION  of capital which 
makes  it capital—THE  ADVANCING OF WAGES—AS ACCIDENTAL,  due  only  to 
the poverty  of the  people,  and  irrelevant  to the  production 
a See  R. Jones,  Text-book  of Lectures  on the Political Economy  of Nations...,  p. 35 
sqq.— Ed. 

=====第355页=====
Richard Jones 345 
process as such. In this narrow circumscribed manner, Ramsay 
denies the necessity for the capitalist mode of production. Jones, 
on the other hand, //strange that they were both priests of the 
ESTABLISHED CHURCH.188 The ministers of the English CHURCH seem to 
think more than their continental [brethren]// demonstrates that it 
is precisely this function that makes capital capital and gives rise to 
the most characteristic features of the capitalist mode of produc­
tion. He shows how this form occurs only at a certain level of 
development of the productive powers and that it then creates an 
entirely new material basis. Consequently, however, his com­
prehension of the fact that this form "can be superseded" and of 
the merely transitory historical necessity for this form, is quite 
different from that of Ramsay and more profound. He by no 
means regards capitalist relations as eternal. 
* "A state of things may hereafter exist, and parts of the world may be approaching 
to it, under which the labourers and the owners of accumulated stock may be 
identical; but in the progress of nations ... this has never yet been the case, and to 
trace and understand that progress, we must observe the labourers gradually 
transferred from the hands of a body of customers, who pay them out of their 
revenues, to those of a body of employers, who pay them by advances of capital out 
of the returns to which the owners aim at realising a distinct revenue. This may not 
be as desirable a state of things as that in which labourers and capitalists are identified, but 
we must still accept it as constituting a stage in the march of industry, which has hitherto 
marked the progress of advancing nations. At that stage the people of Asia have 
not yet arrived" * ([p.] 73). 
[XVIII-1139] Here Jones states quite explicitly that capital and 
the capitalist mode of production are to be "accepted" merely as a 
transitional phase in the development of social production, a phase 
which, if one considers the development of the productive powers 
of social labour, constitutes a gigantic advance on all preceding 
forms,  but which is by no means the end result; on the contrary, 
the necessity of its destruction is contained in the antagonism 
between  "OWNERS OF ACCUMULATED WEALTH" and the "ACTUAL LABOURERS". 
Jones was a professor of political economy at Haileybury and 
the successor to Malthus. One can see here how the real science of 
political economy ends by regarding the bourgeois production 
relations as merely historical ones, leading to higher relations in 
which the antagonism on which they are based is resolved. By 
analysing them political economy breaks down the apparently 
mutually independent forms in which wealth appears. This 
analysis (even in Ricardo) goes so far that 1) The independent, 
material form of wealth disappears and wealth is shown to be simply 
the activity of men. Everything which is not the result of human 
activity, of labour, is nature and, as such, is not social wealth. The 

=====第356页=====
346 Theories of Surplus Value 
phantom of the world of goods fades away and it is seen to be 
simply a continually disappearing and continually reproduced 
objectivisation of human labour. All solid material wealth is only 
transitory materialisation of social labour, crystallisation of the 
production process whose measure is time, the measure of a 
movement  itself.  2) The manifold forms in which the various 
component parts of wealth are distributed amongst different 
sections of society lose their apparent independence. Interest is 
merely a part of profit, rent is merely surplus profit. Both are 
consequently merged in profit, which itself can be resolved in 
surplus value, that is, to unpaid labour. The value of the 
commodity  itself,  however, can only be reduced to labour time. 
The Ricardian school reaches the point where it rejects one of the 
forms of appropriation of this surplus value—landed property 
(rent)—as useless, in so far as it is pocketed by private individuals. 
It rejects the idea that the landowner is an agent of capitalist 
production. The antithesis is thus reduced to that between capitalist 
and wage labourer. This relationship, however, is regarded by the 
Ricardian political economists as given, as a natural law, on which the 
production process itself is based. The later economists go one step 
further and, like Jones, admit only the historical justification for this 
relationship. But from the moment that the bourgeois mode of 
production and the conditions of production and distribution which 
correspond to it are recognised as historical, the delusion of 
regarding them as natural laws of production vanishes and the 
prospect opens up of a new society, [a new] economic formation of 
society, to which the bourgeois mode of production is only the 
transition.

rate of profit. 
But, first of all, another point has to be emphasised. 
[XVIII-1140] *"The capitalist has been but an agent to give the labourers the 
benefit of the expenditure of the revenues of the surrounding customers, in a new 
form and under new circumstances" * ([p.] 79). 
This refers to the NON-AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS, whose earnings 
previously came direct from the revenue of the LANDHOLDERS, etc. 
Whereas previously they exchanged their labour (or the product 
of their labour) directly for that revenue, the capitalist exchanges 
the product of their labour—collected and concentrated in his 
hands—for that revenue, in other words, revenue is transformed 
into,  exchanged for capital, in that it constitutes the RETURNS on 
capital. Instead of being direct RETURNS for labour, it constitutes 
direct RETURNS for the capital that EMPLOYS THE LABOURERS.

high interest,  30%,  HAVING  NO  RELATION  TO  PROFIT WHICH MIGHT  BE  GAINED  in 
INDUSTRIAL  OPERATIONS"  (The  Economist,  [No. 491,]  January  22, 1853 [p.  89]).I89 
But the  interest charged  by usurers  who  advance  seeds,  etc.,  or 
lend  the  loom,  etc., to  THE  RYOTS  bears just  as little  "RELATION  TO 
PROFIT"  gained  by the  latter.  I.e. it  bears  no  relation  to the  profit 
made by these  HINDOO CULTIVATORS  and  WEAVERS.  Just as little does the 
interest  English workers  pay at the  pawnshop (100%  a year  on the 
average; see Tuckett 3) HAVE ANY RELATION  TO THE RATE OF THEIR WAGES AND 
STILL LESS  TO  "PROFITS REALISED  BY  THEM".  The interest these usurers 
receive rather includes  not  only  the  entire profit  (THE WHOLE SURPLUS 
VALUE),  but  constitutes  in part  a deduction from  the  wages, these being 
depressed  even under  the  Indian level, which  is low in  itself, partly 
because  of the  HINDOOS'  limited needs  and  partly because  of the 
fertility of the soil,  WHENCE  LOW  PRICE  OF RICE,  etc. Incidentally, this 
reproduces itself  in  England,  for  instance, where  "HOME INDUSTRY" 
exists  merely  as a  form  not yet  really  (but  only formally) subsumed 
under  the  capitalist mode  of production,  etc.  This against  the 
jackass  Carey,  who e.g.  compares  the  interest paid  by an  Indian 
RYOT  with that paid on  FIRST CLASS BILLS  in England, to demonstrate 
how much higher wages  are in  England than  in India.b  But now 
back  to The  Economist, which adds  the  following  to the  above: 
"The lender here  CHARGES  an * interest  so high  as to be  sufficient  to replace  the 
principal  in a  short time,  or at  least  as, on the  average  of all his  lending 
transactions, might serve  to counterbalance  his  losses  in particular instances,  by the 
apparently exorbitant gains acquired  in others*" (I.e.). 
Concerning  the  rate  of interest,  it says: 
* "The rate  of interest depends:  1)  upon  the  rate  of profit;  2)  upon  the 
proportion  in which  the  entire profit  is divided between lender  and  borrower"  * 
(The Economist, I.e.). 
The Economist, like  all English economists,  of course [considers 
that] profit=THE  WHOLE SURPLUS VALUE  minus  RENT;  interest is merely 
PART  OF IT. 
* "Abundance  or scarcity  of the  precious metals,  the  high  or low  scale  of general 
prices prevailing, determines only whether  a greater  or less amount  of money will 
be required  in effecting  the  exchanges between borrowers  and  lenders,  as well  as 
every other species  of exchange...*  The  only difference  is *that  a greater  sum of 
money would  be needed  to represent  and  transfer  the  capital lent  ... the  relation 
between  the sum  paid  for the use of  capital  and the  capital expresses  the  rate  of 
interest  as measured  in money"* ([pp.] 89-90).

[XVIII-1141] Regarding the pawnshop business: 
* "It is by  frequent fluctuations  in a  month,  and by  pawning  one  article  to 
relieve another, where  a small  sum is  obtained, that  the  premium  for  money 
becomes  so excessive.  240  licensed pawnbrokers  in London  and  about  1,450 in the 
country.  The  capital employed  is estimated  at about  1 million.*  It is  turned round 
at least thrice  in the  course  of a  year  and  yields each time 33'/2%  on an  average;  so 
that  the  INFERIOR ORDERS  OF England yearly  pay 1  MILLION  for the *  temporary  loan 
of a million, exclusive  of what they lose  by goods being forfeited"  * (J. D.  Tuckett,

COURT  OF  EXCHEQUER.  Homer versus Taunton.  DECEMBER  21, 1859 
(Reynolds's [Newspaper],  DECEMBER  25, 1859 [No. 489, pp. 11, 1]). 
(STOCKING WEAVERS.3) 
"THIS WAS AN  ACTION FOR  LIBEL  by Homer (HOSIER  and  GROCER)  (his  wife runs  a 
SHOP  at that place) AT  EARL  Shilton,  NEAR  Hinckley-Leicestershire, versus Taunton, 
EDITOR  of the  Midland Express, *  for two  libels imputing  to the  plaintiff oppression 
and tyranny over  the  working people  in his  employ,  and  also [charging  him]  with 
being  a truckmaster.*" 
(INSTEAD  OF  PAYING  HIS  WORKPEOPLE  IN WAGES,  that fellow  MADE THEM TAKE 
OUT THEIR EARNINGS  IN HIS WIFE'S SHOP.) 
"HE EMPLOYED BETWEEN  200 and 300  WORKPEOPLE.  After  all the  deductions  the 
AVERAGE EARNINGS  are between  3s. 6d. and 4s. A  WEEK.  A FRAME  COSTS  £2,  AND THE 
MASTER CHARGES THE WORKMAN  £2 10  A YEAR FOR THE USE OF THE FRAME.  (Is. per 
WEEK;  of the 52  weeks,  50 are  WORKING WEEKS.)" 
//Hence in a year he makes 50s. on 40s., or 125%. This shows 
Mr. Carey the size of interest (rent) where profit really appears in 
industrial countries like England in the exceptional form in which 
he generally conceives of it, namely as interest or rent which the 
capitalist receives from the worker for the rent of the machine. 
This also disposes of the twaddle about the  LABOUR  OF SUPERINTENDENCE. 
Some of these  KNITTERS  formerly owned  FRAMES,  but the emergence 
of improved ones made theirs valueless. 
* "The workman,  now, be it  remarked,  is not  allowed  to buy one for  himself. 
Prior  to certain alterations  in the  construction  of the  stocking frame,  a skilled  and 
industrious  man  could earn from 8-10s.  a week"* [ibid.,  p. 1]. 
As regards the benefits deriving from improvements in machinery 
for the worker  himself,  the rapid series of improvements in the  JENNY 
MULE  in the 18th century made it impossible for the  INDEPENDENT 
(notably  AGRICULTURAL) WEAVERS  to replace their machines, rendered 
valueless, by new ones, and landed them in the hands of the 
capitalists. (Apart from the fact that the machines, once developed 
and capable of being  MOVED  BY MECHANICAL  POWER,  led on to the  FACTORY 
SYSTEM.)

350 Theories  of Surplus Value 
("The IMPROVEMENTS," says Babbage  in his  book,  1832,  CH. XXIX  [p.  281],a 
"which took place  not  long  ago  in frames  for  making patent-net were  so great, that  a 
machine,  in good repair, which  had  cost £1,200, sold  a few  years after  for £60. During 
the great speculations  in that trade,  the  IMPROVEMENTS succeeded each other  so 
rapidly, that machines which  had  never been finished were abandoned  in the  hands  of 
their makers,  who  were left stranded through happier discoveries serving  the  same 
purpose.")// 
* "A man,  with  a wife  and 4  children,  was  enabled  to earn from  6s. to 6s. 6d. a 
week;  but  after  the  usual deduction  for  frame rent, room rent, scouring,  etc., had 
been taken,  no more than  2s.  remained  to support himself  and  family. Another 
very able hand, having been  20 years  in the  trade, could earn  as much  as 12s. a 
week;  but  then,  he would have  to work  15 hours every  day.  One man,  examined  in 
the course  of this trial, declared that  all the  clothes  he had on,  with  the  exception 
of his  coat, were borrowed."  "The  money thus made,"* says Reynolds's Newspaper, 
* "is the  distillation  of the  sweat  and the  strength  of the  starving [XVIII-1142]  and 
squalid myriads,  to whom life  is a  dismal penance  of incessant  and  unrequited 
toil."* 
The journalist who had denounced this  TASKMASTER  was fined £5 
for LIBEL. 
Where capitalist production  is capitalist merely  in form,  the 
capitalist is merely a  RACK-RENTING "MIDDLEMAN".  This holds equally for 
industry carried  on in  this  way and for  Irish  or Indian  agriculture. 
TAKE  the following item from The Times of March 13, 1862,  HEADED 
"STARVING  NEEDLEWOMEN": 
* "A deputation waited  on Sir G.  Lewis,  at the War  Office,  on the 11th  March. 
An association, originally established  by  Miss Barlee,  and now  powerfully 
supported, proposes  to undertake  the  contracts  for  military clothing  on the  same 
terms  now  given  by  Government  to contractors,  and yet to pay the  starving 
needlewomen  an  advance  of 30% on  their present wages. This result  is simply 
obtained  by getting  rid of the  'middleman'  and  applying  his profits  to the  benefit  of 
the human material  out of  which they have hitherto been made. With every 
advantage  the  society  can  give,  an ordinary needlewoman cannot earn more than 
Is. for 10  hours' incessant labour  at soldiers' shirts  (viz.  2 shirts  a day),  and at  cloth 
work  not  more than  Is. 6d. a day, for 12  hours' work.  At contract work  her  wages 
now vary from  5d. to 8d. per 10  hours' work."* 
//For  a seven-day week this makes  35 to 56d., i.e.  from  2s. lid. 
to 4s. 8d. a  week.// 
//"Admittedly there  is something cruel about this robbing  of the  worker;  but it 
constitutes  the  very basis, the surest source  of profit,  and  commercial probity  has not the 
least occasion  to blush  on account  of it. The  most honourable fellow  may  engage  in 
it on his  terrain:  the  master's wresting  the  utmost from  the  worker  is within  the 
rules  of war,  they  are two  contending powers" [Leduc,]  Sir Richard Arkwright,  I.e.,

//The capitalist's real profit  is largely  PROFIT UPON EXPROPRIATION,  and 
there  is a  particularly wide scope  for the  "individual work"  of the 
capitalist  in  this,  the  mercantile field, where  it is not a  matter  OF 
creating  SURPLUS VALUE  but of  distributing  the  AGGREGATE  profit  of the 
WHOLE CLASS  OF  CAPITALISTS AMONG  ITS  INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS.  This does not 
concern  us  here.192 Certain kinds  of  profit,  e.g.  that based  on 
speculation, occur solely  in  this field. Therefore, examining them 
here would  be  totally irrelevant.  It is  evidence  of vulgar economy's 
brute stupidity that  it lumps these  — notably  in order  to  represent 
profit  as  "WAGES"  — with profit  so  FAR AS  IT ORIGINATES  IN THE CREATION  OF 
SURPLUS VALUE.  See, e.g., the  worthy Roscher.193  It is  therefore quite 
natural that such jackasses,  in  discussing  the  distribution  of the 
AGGREGATE  profit  of the  whole capitalist class, should throw together 
the calculation items  and  compensation titles  of  capitals  in 
different spheres  of  production with  the  causes behind  the 
exploitation  of the  workers  by the  capitalists, with  the  factors 
behind  the  origin  of  profit  as  such,  so to  speak.//

the picul (about  133 lbs).  Not  above  V4 or V5 of this weight  ... is  cotton;  and the 
natives,  by  means  of rude rollers, separate,  at the  expense  of one  day's labour, 
about  IV4 lb.  of cotton from  the  seed.  In this stage  it is  worth between  4 or 5  times 
its original cost;  and the  prices  of the  same substance,  in its  different stages  of 
manufacture,  are for one  picul:

be estimated,  in 1792,  at a  quarter  of the population, which  was  around  15 million. 
The available mechanical power,  at the time,  was  probably three times that  of manual 
labour  in  value. Consequently,  the  manual labour  was  equal  to  that  of 
3,750,000  men,  and the  mechanical labour  to that of three times this number,  or 
roughly  the  labour  of 11,250,000  men,  the  total product having  the  value  of the 
labour  of 15,000,000  men.  As a  result,  the  population  and the  total accumulated

productive power were evenly balanced.  But the  introduction  of the  improved steam 
engine, weaving looms,  etc.,  multiplied Great Britain's productive power incalcula­
bly. Manual labour  has  increased  by enlisting  the  daily labour, carried  on  almost 
continuously,  of women  and  children  at the manufactories,  and as a  result  it can now be 
assessed  as that  of one-third  of the  population, which  had  grown  to 18  million  by 
1817,  an increase  of 3  million over  25 years.  But  since  the  introduction  of the 
improved machines  of Arkwright  and  Watt there  has  been  a real rise  in the  powers 
productive  of wealth equal  to the  labour  of 200  million active, strong  and 
well-trained workers, that  is to say 10  times  the  population  of the  British Isles,  or 
thirty times  the amount  of manual labour replaced today  by this increase  in the  means 
of producing wealth.  The  following changes occurred between  1792 and  1817:  the 
population rose from 15,000,000  to 18,000,000; manual labour rose from  1/4 to V3, 
which  in relation  to 18,000,000 people means  6 million. 
"The newly created [productive] power=the labour  of ... 200  million people.

11,250,000. Grand total  of productive power  in 1817 ...  217,250,000 people,  or, as a 
ratio  to the  population  of 1817, 12.6 to 1. It  follows from this table that over  a 
period  of 25  years Britain achieved  a level  of industrial development  and 
productive power enabling  it to  increase  its wealth  at an  annual rate  12 times that 
of the  past,  and  that  it can  therefore sacrifice this surplus, whether  in war 
expenditure  or in  foreign trade unprofitable  to it, or  employ  it to  improve  the 
condition  of its  population"  ([H. G.  Macnab,] Examen impartial des nouvelles vues  de

Economy IN  EXPENSE  and  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL. 
"It will  be necessary occasionally  to adjust  or repair  the  machine; this  is done 
with greater ease  by a  workman accustomed  to machine-making than  by one who 
merely directs  its motion.  Now,  since  the  good performance  of machines  and  their 
duration depend  to a  very great extent upon  the  care given  to immediately 
correcting every irregular vibration,  the  tiniest imperfection  in their parts  as soon 
as they appear,  it is  evident that  the  expenditure arising from  the  reparation  and 
the wear  and  tear  of  machinery  is considerably reduced  by  installing  the 
appropriate workman right  on the  spot.  But in the  case  of a  single tulle loom, this 
would  be too  expensive  a plan.  The  conclusion immediately following  is that only 
an establishment using  a number  of such looms  may  have recourse  to it, so  that the 
whole time  of one  workman  can be  occupied  in keeping them  in order  and  making 
whatever repairs happen  to be  necessary.  If this principle  of economy  is applied 
consistently,  one is  bound  of necessity  to double  and  treble  the  number  of 
machines,  in order  to employ  the  whole time  of 2 or 3  skilful workmen" (Babbage,

OF ADVANCING WAGES,  and the  LABOUR FUND  itself appears as  "WEALTH SAVED 
FROM  REVENUE  AND  EMPLOYED WITH  A VIEW  TO  PROFIT",  Jones outlines the 
CHANGES  in the development of the productive powers characteristic 
of this mode of production. How the  (ECONOMICAL) RELATIONS  and 
consequently the social, moral and political  STATE  of NATIONS CHANGES 
with the  CHANGE  in the  MATERIAL POWERS  OF PRODUCTION,  is very well 
explained. 
* "As communities change their powers  of production, they necessarily change their 
habits  too" ([p.] 48).  "During their progress  in advance,  all the  different classes  of 
the community find that they  are  connected with other classes  by new  relations,  are 
assuming  new  positions,  and are  surrounded  by new  moral  and  social dangers,  and 
new conditions  of social  and  political excellence"  * (I.e.). 
He describes  the  influence  of the  capitalist form  of production 
on the  development  of the  productive powers  in the  following 
way. But  before coming  to this,  a few  passages connected with 
those already  quoted. 
* "Great political, social, moral,  and  intellectual changes accompany changes  in the 
economical organisation  of communities,  and in the  agencies  and the  means, affluent 
or scanty,  by which  the  tasks  of industry  are  carried  on.  These changes necessarily 
exercise  a commanding influence over  the  different political  and  social elements  to 
be found  in the  populations where they take place; that influence extends  to the 
intellectual character,  to the  habits, manners, morals,  and  happiness  of nations" 
([p.] 45).  "England  is the  only great country which  has  taken  ... the  first step  in 
advance towards perfection  as a  producing machine;  the  only country  in which  the 
population, agricultural  as well  as non-agricultural,  is ranged under  the  direction  of 
capitalists,  and  where  the  effects  of their means  and of the  peculiar functions they 
alone  can  perform,  are  extensively felt,  not  only  in the  enormous growth  of her 
wealth,  but  also  in all the  economical relations  and  positions  of her  population. 
Now, England,  I say it  with regret,  but  without  the  very slightest hesitation,  is not 
to be  taken  as a  safe specimen  of [XVIII-1145]  the  career  of a  people  so 
developing their productive forces" ([pp.] 48-49). 
"The general labour fund consists:  1) of  wages which  the  labourers themselves 
produce.  2) Of the  revenues  of other classes expended  in the  maintenance  of 
labour.  3) Of  capital,  or a  portion  of wealth saved from revenue  and  employed  in 
advancing wages with  a view  to profit. Those maintained  on the  first division  of the 
labour fund  we  will call unhired labourers. Those  on the  second, paid dependants. 
Those  on the  third, hired workmen"* (wage labourers). *"The receipt  of wages 
from  any of  these  3 divisions  of the  labour fund determines  the  relations  of the 
labourer with  the  other classes  of society,  and so  determines sometimes directly, 
sometimes more  or less indirectly,  the  degree  of continuity, skill,  and  power with 
which  the  tasks  of industry  are  carried  on"  ([pp.] 51-52).  "The  first division, 
self-produced wages, maintains more than  half,  probably more than  2/3, of the 
labouring population  of the  earth. These labourers consist everywhere  of peasants 
who occupy  the  soil and  labour  on it... The  second division  of the  labour fund, 
revenue expended  in maintaining labour, supports  by far the  greater part  of the 
productive non-agricultural labourers  of the  East.  It is of  some importance  on the 
continent  of Europe; while  in England, again,  it comprises only  a few  jobbing 
mechanics,  the  relics  of a  larger  body.  The  third division  of the  labour fund, capital,  is 
seen in England employing  the  great majority  of her  labourers, while  it maintains

354 Theories  of Surplus Value 
but a small body  of individuals  in Asia  and in  continental Europe maintains only 
the non-agricultural labourers;  not  amounting, probably,  on the  whole,  to a  quarter 
of the  productive population"  ([p.] 52). "I  have  not ...  made  any  distinction  as to 
slave-labour...  The  civil rights  of labourers  do not  affect their economical position. 
Slaves,  as well  as freemen,  may be  observed subsisting  on each part  of the  general 
fund"  * ([p.] 53). 
Although  the  "CIVIL RIGHTS"  of the  LABOURERS  DO  NOT  AFFECT "THEIR 
ECONOMICAL POSITION", THEIR ECONOMICAL POSITION HOWEVER DOES AFFECT THEIR 
CIVIL RIGHTS.  Wage labour  on a  national scale—and consequently, 
the capitalist mode  of production  as well—is only possible where 
the workers  are  personally free.  It is  based  on the  personal 
freedom  of the  workers. 
Jones quite correctly reduces Smith's  PRODUCTIVE  and  UNPRODUCTIVE 
labour  to its  essence—capitalist  and  non-capitalist labour—by 
correctly applying  [the  distinction made  by]  Smith between 
LABOURERS  paid BY  CAPITAL  and those paid  OUT  OF  REVENUE.  Jones 
himself, however, apparently understands  by  productive  and 
unproductive  LABOUR,  labour which enters into  the  production  OF 
MATERIAL  [wealth]  and  that which does  not.  This follows from  the 
passage quoted, where he speaks of the  PRODUCTIVE LABOURERS  WHO 
DEPEND  ON REVENUE EXPENDED  to maintain them [p. 52]- Further: 
* "The portion  of the  community which  is unproductive  of material wealth  may be 
useful,  or it may be  useless"  * ([p.] 42).  Further:  * "It is  reasonable,  to consider  the 
act of production  as incomplete till  the  commodity produced  has  been placed  in the 
hands  of the  person  who is to  consume  it" (p. 35,  note).* 
The distinction made between the  LABOURERS  who live on  CAPITAL 
and those  who  live  on  REVENUE  is concerned with  the  form  of 
labour.  It expresses  the  whole difference between capitalist  and 
non-capitalist modes  of production.  On the  other hand,  the  terms 
productive  and  unproductive  LABOURERS  in the  narrow sense  [are 
concerned with] labour which enters into  the  production  of 
commodities (production here embraces  all  operations which  the 
commodity has to undergo from the  FIRST PRODUCER  to the  CONSUMER) 
no matter what kind  of labour  is applied, whether  it is  manual 
labour  or not  ([including] scientific labour),  and  labour which does 
not enter into,  and  whose  aim and  purpose  is not, the  production 
of commodities. This difference must  be kept  in mind  and the  fact 
that all other sorts  of activity influence  MATERIAL PRODUCTION  and  vice 
versa  in no way  affects  the  necessity  for  making this distinction. 
[XVIII-1146]  We now  come  to the  development  of the  productive 
powers  by the  capitalist mode  of production. 
*"It may be as  well  to point  out  here  how  this fact"  //of the  wages being 
advanced  by  capital// "affects their powers  of production,  or the  continuity,  the 
knowledge,  and the  power,  with which labour  is exerted...  The  capitalist  who  pays  a

workman  may  assist  the  continuity  of his  labour. First,  by making such continuity 
possible; secondly,  by superintending  and  enforcing  it. Many large bodies  of workmen 
throughout  the  world  ply the  street  for  customers,  and  depend  for  wages  on the 
casual wants  of persons  who  happen  at the  moment  to require their services,  or to 
want  the  articles they  can  supply.  The  early missionaries found this  the  case  in 
China...  'The  artisans  run  about  the  towns from morning  to night  to seek custom. 
The greater part  of Chinese workmen work  in private houses.  Are  clothes wanted, 
for example?  The  tailor comes  to you in the  morning  and  goes home  at night.  It is 
the same with  all other artisans. They  are  continually running about  the  streets  in 
search  of work, even  the  smiths,  who  carry about their hammer  and  their furnace 
for ordinary jobs.  The  barbers,  too ...  walk about  the  streets with  an armchair  on 
their shoulders,  and a  basin  and  boiler  for hot  water  in their hands.'194  This 
continues  to be the  case very generally throughout  the  East,  and  partially  in the 
Western World.  Now  these workmen cannot  for any  length  of time work continuously. 
They must  ply  like  a hackney coachman,  and  when  no  customer happens  to 
present himself they must  be idle.  If in the  progress  of time  a change takes place  in 
their economical position,  if they become  the workmen  of a  capitalist who advances their 
wages beforehand,  two  things take place. First, they  can  now labour continuously;  and, 
secondly,  an agent  is provided, whose office  and  whose interest  it will be, to see that they 
do labour continuously  ... the  capitalist  has  reserves  ... to  wait  for a  customer... 
Here,  then,  is an  increased continuity  in the  labour  of all  this class  of persons. They 
labour daily from morning  to night,  and are not  interrupted  by waiting  for or  seeking 
the customer,  who is  ultimately  to consume  the  article they work  on. But the 
continuity  of their labour, thus made possible,  is secured  and  improved  by the 
superintendence  of the capitalist.  He has advanced their  wages  ; he is  to receive the products 
of their labour.  It is his  interest  and his  privilege to see that they do  not labour interruptedly 
or dilatorily.  The  continuity  of labour thus secured,  the  effect even  of this change 
on the  productive power  of labour  is very great...  The  power  is doubled.  Two 
workmen steadily employed from morning  to night,  and  from year's  end to  year's 
end, will probably produce more than  4 desultory workmen,  who  consume much  of 
their time  in running after customers,  and in  recommencing suspended labour"  * 
([p.] 37 sqq.). 
Firstly. The transition from  LABOURERS  who perform  CASUAL 
SERVICES—making  coats, trousers, etc., in the  LANDOWNERS  house— 
to workers employed by capital, is already very well descri­
bed by TurgoC Second. Although  CONTINUITY  certainly distingui­
shes capitalist  LABOUR  from the form described by Jones, it does 
not distinguish [capitalist labour] from slave production carried on 
on a large scale.  Third.  It is incorrect to describe the increased 
amount of labour brought about by its long duration and continuity 
as an increase in productive power or the  POWER  of LABOUR.  This 
[occurs] only in so  FAR AS THE CONTINUITY AUGMENTS THE PERSONAL SKILL OF THE 
LABOURERS.  By [increased]  POWER,  we understand the greater produc­
tivity  Of A  GIVEN QUANTITY  OF  LABOUR EMPLOYED,  NOT ANY  CHANGE  IN THE 
QUANTITY EMPLOYED.  The latter belongs rather to the formal subordi-

nation of labour to capital and it only evolves fully with the 
development of fixed capital. (We shall deal with this soon.) 
Jones correctly emphasises the fact that the capitalist regards 
labour as his property, no part of which must be wasted. With 
regard to LABOUR which is maintained directly by REVENUE, this is a 
matter of the use value of labour only. [XVIII-1147] Furthermore, 
Jones correctly emphasises that the SEDENTARY labour of the 
NON-AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS lasting from morning to night is by no 
means something which arises spontaneously, but is itself a product 
of economic development. In contrast to the Asiatic form and to 
the Western form [of labour] (prevailing in former times, partly 
even today) in the countryside, the urban labour of the Middle 
Ages already constitutes a great advance and serves as a 
preparatory school for the capitalist mode of production, as 
regards  the CONTINUITY and STEADINESS OF LABOUR. 
//About this CONTINUITY OF LABOUR : 
* "The capitalist, too, keeps, as it were, an echo-office for labour; he insures 
against the uncertainty of finding a vent for labour, which uncertainty would, but 
for him, prevent the labour, in many cases, from being undertaken. The trouble of 
looking for a purchaser, and of going to a market, is reduced, by his means, to a 
comparatively small compass" * (An Inquiry into Those Principles, Respecting the Nature 
of Demand and the Necessity of Consumption etc, London, 1821, [p.] 102). 
In the same work: 
* "Where the capital is in a great degree  fixed,  or where it is sunk on land ... the 
trader is obliged to continue to employ, much more nearly (than if there had been 
less fixed capital), the same amount of circulating capital as he did before, in order 
not to cease to derive any profit from the part that is fixed"* (I.e., [p.] 73).// 
//•"Of the state of manners to which the dependence of the workmen on the 
revenues of their customers has given birth in China, you would, perhaps, get the 
most striking picture in the Chinese Exhibition, so long kept open by its American 
proprietor in London. It is thronged with figures of artisans with their small packs 
of tools, plying for customers, and idle when none appear—painting vividly to the 
eye the necessary absence, in their case, of that continuity of labour which is one of 
the three great elements of its productiveness, and indicating sufficiently, to any 
well-informed observer, the absence also of fixed capital and machinery, hardly less 
important elements of the fruitfulness of industry"* (Jones, I.e., [Text-book of 
Lectures on the Political Economy of Nations, p.] 73). *"In India, where the 
admixture of Europeans has not changed the scene, a like spectacle may be seen in 
the towns. The artisans in rural districts are, however, provided for there in a 
peculiar manner... Such handicraftsmen and other non-agriculturists as were 
actually necessary in a village were maintained by an assignment of a portion of the 
joint revenues of the villagers, and throughout the country bands of hereditary 
workmen existed on this fund, whose industry supplied the simple wants and tastes 
which the cultivators did not provide [for] by their own hands. The position and 
rights of these rural artisans soon became, like all rights in the East, hereditary. 
The band found its customers in the other villagers. The villagers were stationary 
and abiding, and so were their handicraftsmen... The artisans of the towns were 
and are in a very different position. They received their wages from what was

substantially  the  same fund—the surplus revenue from land—but modified  in its 
mode  of distribution  and  its distributors,  so as to  destroy their sedentary permanence, 
and produce frequent,  and  usually disastrous migrations  ... such artisans  are not 
confined  to any  location  by dependence  on masses  of fixed capital" *  (as in  Europe,  for 
example,  where  COTTON  and  other  MANUFACTORIES  are  FIXED  IN DISTRICTS  where 
there  is  WATERPOWER,  OR  ABUNDANT  STEAM-PRODUCING  FUEL,  and  CONSIDERABLE 
MASSES  OF  WEALTH  have been  CONVERTED  INTO  BUILDINGS  and  MACHINERY,  etc.). 
*"...The case  [is]  different when  the  sole [XVIII-1148] dependence  of the 
labourers  is on the direct receipt  of part of the revenues  of the persons who consume 
the commodities  the  artisans produce. They  are not  confined  to the  neighbourhood  of 
any fixed capital.  If their customers change their location  for  long—nay, sometimes 
for very short—periods,  the  non-agricultural labourers must follow them,  or 
starve" (Jones,  I.e., [pp.]  73-74).  "The  greater part  of*  this FUND  for the 
HANDICRAFTSMEN  IN ASIA  is * distributed  by the State  and its  officers.  The  capital'1 
was, necessarily,  the  principal centre  of distribution"  ([p.] 75).  "From Samarkand, 
southwards  to  Beejapoor  and  Seringapatam,  we can  trace  the  ruins  of vanishing 
capitals,  of  which  the  population left them suddenly"*  (and not  as in  other 
countries  [as a result  of a gradual] decline) *  "as soon  as new centres  of distribution of 
[the] royal revenues,  i.e. of the  whole  of the  surplus produceb  of the  soil, were 
established"  * (I.e., [p.] 76). 
See Dr.  Bernier,c who compares  the  Indian towns  to army camps. 
This  is due to the  form  of landed property which exists  in Asia.// 
We now proceed from the  CONTINUITY  to the  DIVISION OF LABOUR,  [the 
development  of]  KNOWLEDGE,  use of  machinery,  etc. 
* "But  the  effect  of the change  of paymasters  on the  continuity  of labour  is by no 
means  yet  exhausted.  The  different tasks  of industry  may now  be further  divided...  If 
he" (the  capitalist) "employ more than  one man,  he can  divide  the  task between 
them;  he can  keep each individual steadily  at work  at the portion  of the  common 
task, which  he  performs  the  best...  If the capitalist  be rich,  and  keep a sufficient 
number  of  workmen, then  the  task may  be subdivided  as far as  it is  capable  of 
subdivision.  The  continuity  of labour  is then complete... Capital,  by assuming  the 
function  of  advancing  the  wages  of labour,  has  now,  by successive steps, perfected 
its continuity.  It, at the  same time, increases  the  knowledge  and  skill by which such 
labour  is applied  to produce  any  given effect.  The  class  of capitalists  are  from  the 
first partially,  and  then become ultimately completely, discharged from the  necessity  of 
manual labour. Their interest  is that the productive powers  of the labourers they employ 
should  be the  greatest possible.  On  promoting that power their attention  is fixed,  and 
almost exclusively fixed. More thought  is brought  to bear  on the  best means  of 
effecting  all  the  purposes  of  human industry; knowledge extends, multiplies  its 
fields  of action,  and  assists industry  in almost every branch...  But  further still  as to 
mechanical power. Capital employed  not  to pay,  but to assist labour,  we  will call 
auxiliary capital."* 
//He  therefore means  by  this term  the  part of  constant capital 
which  is not  made  up of  RAW  MATERIAL.//

358 Theories  of Surplus Value 
* "The national mass  of auxiliary capital  may,  certain conditions being fulfilled, 
increase indefinitely:  the  number  of labourers remaining the same.  At every step  of such 
increase, [there  is an  increase]  in the  third element  of the  efficiency  of human 
labour, namely,  its mechanical power... Auxiliary capital thus increases  its mass relatively 
to the population... What conditions, then, must  be fulfilled that  the  mass  of auxiliary 
capital employed  to assist them"  //the  capitalist's workmen//  "may  increase? There 
must concur  3 things: 
"1) the  means  of saving  the  additional capital; 
"2) the  will to save  it; 
"3) some invention  by which  it may be  [made] possible, through  the use of  such 
capital, that  the  productive powers  of labour  may be  increased,  and  increased  to an 
extent which will make  it, in  addition  to the  wealth  it before produced, reproduce  the 
additional auxiliary capital  used,  as fast as it is  destroyed,  and  also some profit  on it... 
When  the  full amount  of auxiliary capital, that  in the actual state  of knowledge can be used 
profitably,  has  already been supplied,  ... an  increased range  of knowledge  can  alone point 
out the  means  of employing more. Further, such employment  is only practicable  if 
the means discovered increase the power  of labour sufficiently  to reproduce the additional 
capital  in the  time it wastes away.  If this  be not the  case,  the  capitalist must lose  his 
wealth...  But the  increased efficiency  of the  labourers must, besides this, produce 
some profit,  or he  would have  no motive  for  employing  his  capital  in production  at 
all... All the  while, that  by employing fresh masses  of auxiliary capital, these  two  objects 
can be effected, there  is no  definite  and  final limit  to the  progressive employment  of 
such fresh masses  of capital. They  may go on  increasing co-extensively with  the 
increase  of knowledge.  But  knowledge  is never stationary;  and, as it  extends itself 
from hour  to hour  in all  directions, from hour  to hour some  new  implement, some 
new machine, some  new  motive force  may  present  itself,  which will enable  the 
community profitably  to add  something  to the  mass  of auxiliary capital  by which  it 
assists  its industry,  and so  increase  the difference between the productiveness  of its  labour 
and that  of poorer  and  less skilful nations"  (I.e. [pp.  38-41]). 
[XVIII-1149] First, with regard to the statement that the 
INVENTIONS,  or  APPLIANCES  or  CONTRIVANCES  must be of such a kind, 
* "that the productive powers of labour are increased to such an 
extent as to make it, in addition to the wealth it before produced, 
reproduce the additional auxiliary capital used, as fast as it is 
destroyed" *, or * "reproduce the additional capital in the time it 
wastes away".* This means nothing more than that the wear and 
tear is replaced au fur et à mesure (que) 3 IT  TAKES PLACE,  OR,  THAT  THE 
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL  IS  REPLACED  IN THE  AVERAGE TIME DURING WHICH  IT IS 
CONSUMED.  A portion of the value of the product, or, what amounts 
to the same thing, a portion of the product, must replace the  CON­
SUMED AUXILIARY CAPITAL,  and, at such a rate that if, in a given pe­
riod of time, it is  WHOLLY CONSUMED,  IT  MAY  BE REPRODUCED WHOLLY,  OR  A 
NEW CAPITAL  OF THE SAME KIND MAY TAKE THE PLACE  OF THE CAPITAL GONE BY.  But 
what is the condition for this? The productivity of labour must rise 
to such an extent through the application of the  ADDITIONAL AUXILIARY

CAPITAL that a part of the product can be deducted to replace this 
component part either in natura or by EXCHANGE. 
The reproduction of the AUXILIARY CAPITAL takes place if the 
productivity is so great, in other words, if the increased amount of 
output produced during the working day of the same length is 
such that a unit of a particular commodity is cheaper than a unit 
produced by the former method, although the aggregate price of 
the total output covers (for example) the annual depreciation of the 
machinery, that is, the amount of depreciation calculated per unit 
of the commodity is insignificant. If the part which replaces the 
depreciation, and secondly the part which replaces the value of 
raw material, are deducted from the total product, then there 
remains a part which pays for the wages and a part which covers 
the profit and even yields more surplus value [although the price 
per unit remains the same as] it was previously... An increase in the 
product could take place without fulfilling this condition. If, for 
example, the number of pounds of twist were to increase tenfold 
(instead of a hundredfold, etc.) and if the VALUE of the wear and 
tear of the machinery which has to be added to the price were to 
drop from 1/6 to Vio» then the twist spun by machinery would be 
dearer than that produced by spindle. If an ADDITIONAL £100 of 
CAPITAL in the form of guano were used in agriculture and if this 
guano had to be replaced in a year, and if the value of a qr 
(produced by the old method)=£2, then 50 ADDITIONAL qrs would 
have to be produced merely to replace the depreciation.197 And 
without this the additional capital could not be used (profit is here 
disregarded). 
Jones'  remark that the ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MUST  BE "REPRODUCED" (of 
course from the sale of the product or in natura) "IN THE TIME IT 
WASTES AWAY" simply means that the commodity must replace the 
wear and tear embodied in it. In order to begin reproduction 
anew, all the value elements contained in the commodity must be 
replaced by the time when its reproduction is to begin again. In 
agriculture, this reproduction time is given as a result of natural 
conditions, and the period of time in which the wear and tear 
must be replaced is given, ni plus ni moins 1' as the time in which all 
the other value elements of grain, for example, have to be 
replaced. In order that the reproduction process can begin, i.e. 
that the renewal of the real process of production can take place, 
the commodity must pass through the process of circulation, that 
is, the commodity must be sold (in so far as it is not replaced in 
a In exactly the same way.— Ed.

natura, like the seeds) and the money for which it is sold converted 
into elements of production again. In the case of grain and other 
agricultural products, there are certain specific periods for this 
reproduction dictated by the seasons, that is, extreme limits, 
definite limits are set to the duration of the process of circulation. 
Second: Such definite limits to the circulation process arise in 
general from the nature of commodities as use values. All 
commodities deteriorate sooner or later, although the ultima 
Thule* of their existence varies. If they are not consumed by 
people (either in the production process or individually), then they 
are consumed by elemental natural forces. They decay, and finally 
they disintegrate. If their use value is destroyed, then their 
exchange value goes down the drain and that puts an end to their 
reproduction. The final limits of their circulation time are 
therefore determined by the natural terminih of reproduction 
proper to them as use values. 
Third: In order that the production process of the commodities 
may be continuous, that is, so that one [XVIII-1150] part of 
capital may be continuously in the production process and the 
other continuously in the process of circulation, very varied 
divisions of capital must take place, in accordance with the natural 
limits of the periods of reproduction, or the limits [of existence] of 
the different use values, or the different spheres of operation of 
capital. 
Fourth: This applies to all the value elements of the commodity 
simultaneously. But, in the case of commodities in the production 
of which a great deal of fixed capital is employed, there is, in 
addition to the limits which their own use values impose on the 
circulation process, another determining factor, namely, the use 
value of fixed capital. IT  WASTES  AWAY  IN A CERTAIN TIME AND, THEREFORE, 
MUST  BE REPRODUCED IN  A GIVEN  PERIOD. Let us assume, for example, that a 
ship lasts 10 years, or a spinning machine 12. The freight carried 
during the 10 years, or the twist sold during the 12 years, must be 
sufficient for a new ship to replace the old one after 10 years and 
for a new spinning machine to replace the old one after 12. If the 
fixed capital is used up in V2 year, then the product must be 
returned from circulation in this period. 
Besides the natural mortality periods for commodities as use 
values—periods which vary greatly amongst different use values— 
and besides the requirements of the continuity of the production 
a A remote goal or end (literally: the farthest Thule, a land considered by the 
ancients to be the northernmost part of the habitable world).—i?d. 
b Periods.— Ed.

Richard Jones 361 
process, which set even more varied final limits to the circulation 
time,  according to whether the commodities must remain in the 
production sphere or can remain in the circulation sphere for a 
longer or shorter period of time, a third factor is thus added, 
namely, the different mortality periods, and therefore different 
requirements of reproduction, of the AUXILIARY CAPITAL used in the 
production of commodities. 
Jones declares that the second condition [for the use of auxiliary 
capital] is the "profit" which the AUXILIARY CAPITAL must "produce", 
and this is the conditio sine qua non for all capitalist production, 
regardless of the particular form in which the capital is employed. 
Nowhere does Jones explain how he conceives the genesis of this 
profit. But since he merely derives it from "LABOUR", and the profit 
yielded by the AUXILIARY CAPITAL simply from the increased EFFICIENCY 
OF THE LABOUR OF THE WORKMEN, it must consist of absolute or relative 
SURPLUS LABOUR. It arises in general from the fact that after 
deducting the part of the product which either in natura or by 
EXCHANGE replaces the constituent parts of capital which consist 
either of raw materials or of instruments of labour, the capitalist, 
firstly, pays  WAGES  from the remainder of the product, and secondly, 
appropriates a part of it as  SURPLUS  PRODUCE,  which he either sells or 
consumes in natura. (This latter is not a significant factor in capitalist 
production and occurs only in a few exceptional cases, when the 
capitalist directly produces necessary means of subsistence.) This 
SURPLUS PRODUCE however, just as the other parts of the product, 
consists of the workers' realised labour, but labour which is not paid 
for; this product of labour is appropriated by the capitalist without 
any equivalent. 
What is new in Jones' presentation is that the increase in the 
AUXILIARY CAPITAL over and above a certain level is contingent on an 
INCREASE  OF KNOWLEDGE.  Jones declares that the necessary conditions 
are: 1) THE MEANS TO SAVE THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL; 2) THE WILL TO SAVE IT; 
3) SOME  INVENTION by means of which the productive power of labour 
is increased sufficiently to reproduce the ADDITIONAL CAPITAL and to 
produce a profit on it. What is necessary above all is that there 
should be a  SURPLUS  PRODUCE  either in kind or  CONVERTED  INTO  MONEY.  In 
the production of cotton, for example, the planters in America 
(like those in India at the present time) were able to plant large 
areas,  but did not have the means for converting the raw cotton 
into cotton by means of CLEANING at the right time. Part of the 
cotton rotted in the fields. This kind of thing was ended by the 
invention of the COTTON GIN. Part of the product is now converted 
into COTTON GIN. But the COTTON GIN does not merely replace its own 

=====第372页=====

cost;  it also increases  the  SURPLUS PRODUCE.  New  markets have  the 
same effect,  for  instance, furthering  the  conversion  of skins into 
money (likewise improved transport). Each  new  machine which 
consumes coal  is a  means  for  converting  SURPLUS  [produce] existing 
in the  shape  of coal into capital.  The  conversion  of a  part  of the 
SURPLUS  [produce] into  AUXILIARY CAPITAL  can  take place  in two  ways: 
[firstly,] increase  in the  AUXILIARY CAPITAL  already  in existence,  its 
reproduction  on a  larger scale; [secondly,] discovery  of new use 
values  or of a new use for  well-known  use  values,  and new 
inventions  of machinery  or of  MOTIVE POWER  leading  to the  creation 
of new kinds of  AUXILIARY CAPITAL.  In this context,  EXTENSION  OF 
KNOWLEDGE  is obviously  one of the  conditions  for  increasing  the 
AUXILIARY CAPITAL  or,  what amounts  to the  same thing,  for the 
conversion of  SURPLUS PRODUCE  or  SURPLUS MONEY  (foreign trade is 
important in this connection) into  SURPLUS OF AUXILIARY CAPITAL.  For 
example,  the  telegraph opens  up a  whole  new  field  for the 
investment  of AUXILIARY CAPITAL,  SO do the  railways,  etc., and so  does 
the whole gutta-percha  and  INDIAN RUBBER  production. 
[XVIII-1151] This point about  the  EXTENSION  OF  KNOWLEDGE  is 
important. 
Consequently, accumulation does  not  have  to set new  labour  in 
motion,  it may  simply direct  the  labour previously employed into 
new channels.  For  example,  the  same mechanical atelier which 
previously made [hand] looms  now  makes power-looms  and  some 
of the  weavers  are  taken over  by  [mills using]  the  changed 
methods  of production while  the  others  are  thrown  on to the 
street. 
When  a machine replaces labour,  it always demands less  new 
labour  (for its own  production) than  it replaces. Perhaps  the old 
labour  is simply given  a new  direction.  In any  case, labour  is freed, 
which after  a greater  or lesser amount  of trials  and  tribulations 
may be used  in other ways.  The  human material  FOR A NEW SPHERE OF 
PRODUCTION  is thus provided.  As far as the  direct freeing  of capital  is 
concerned,  it is not the  capital which buys  the  machine which 
becomes free,  BECAUSE  IT IS INVESTED  IN IT.  And  even assuming that  the 
machine  is cheaper than  the  amount  of wages  it replaces, more 
raw material,  etc.,  will  be required.  If the  workers  now  dismissed 
previously cost £500  and the new  machine costs  500 too,  then  the 
capitalist previously  had an  outlay  of 500  every year, whereas  the 
machine  may  perhaps last  10  years,  so that IN  FACT  he now has 
an outlay  of only  50 a  year.  But  what  at any  rate becomes free 
(after deducting  the  [expenditure  for] the  larger number  of workers 
employed  in the  manufacture  of the  machine  and in  AUXILIARY

MATTERS connected with it, such as coal [production], etc.) is the 
capital which constituted the income of the [dismissed] workers or 
that [employed in the production of commodities] which these 
workers bought with their wages. This continues to exist as it did 
previously, if workers are simply replaced as MOTIVE POWER without 
the machinery itself being substantially altered, for example, if 
wind or water [now operate the machinery] where this was done 
previously [by workers], two lots of capital are freed, the capital 
previously spent on paying the workers and the capital for which 
their money income was exchanged. This is an example used by 
Ricardo." 
But one part of the product previously converted into wages is 
now always reproduced as AUXILIARY CAPITAL. 
A large part of the labour previously used directly in the 
production of means of subsistence is now used in the production 
of AUXILIARY CAPITAL. This too is in contradiction to Adam Smith's 
view, according to which the accumulation of capital=the employ­
ment of more productive labour.b Apart from the examples 
considered above, the result may be merely a CHANGE in the 
APPLICATION OF LABOUR and a WITHDRAWAL of labour from the direct 
production of means of subsistence and its transfer to the 
production of means of production, railways, bridges, machinery, 
canals and so on. 
// How important the existing amount of means of production 
and the existing scale of production are for accumulation [is 
described in the following]: 
"The astonishing expedition with which a great cotton factory, comprehending 
spinning and weaving, can be erected in Lancashire, arises from the vast 
collection of patterns of every variety, from those of gigantic steam engines, 
waterwheels, iron girders and joists, down to the smallest member of a throstle or 
loom in possession of the engineers, mill-wrights, and machine makers. In the 
course of last year Mr. Fairbairn equipped waterwheels equivalent to 700 horses 
power and steam engines to 400 horses power from his engineer factory alone, 
independent of his mill-wright and stea.m-boiler establishment. Hence, whenever 
capital comes forward to take advantage of improved demand for goods, the means 
of fructifying it are provided with such rapidity, that it may realise its own amount 
in profit, ere an analogous factory could be set a-going in France, Belgium or 
Germany" (A. Ure, Philosophie des manufactures etc., Vol. I, Paris, 1836, [pp.] 61-62). c

[XVIII-1152] With development, machinery becomes cheaper, 
partly relatively—in comparison with its  FORCE—and  partly 
absolutely; at the same time, however, a massive concentration of 
machinery takes place in the workshop so that its value increases 
in proportion to the living labour employed, although the value of 
its individual components declines. 
The driving force—the machine which produces the MOTIVE 
POWER—becomes  cheaper as the machinery which TRANSMITS the 
power and the machine which the power operates, are improved, 
as friction is reduced, etc. 
"The facilities resulting from the employment of self-acting tools have not only 
improved the accuracy and accelerated the construction of the machinery of a mill, but 
have also lowered its cost and increased its mobility in a remarkable degree. At present 
a throstle frame, made in the past manner, may be had complete at the rate of 
9s. 6d. per spindle, and a MULE JENNY at about 8s. per spindle including the patent 
licence for the latter. The spindles in cotton factories move with so little friction that 1 
horse power drives 500 on the fine hand mule, 300 on the  MULE  JENNY,  and 180 on the 
throstle; which power includes all the subsidiary preparation machines as carding, 
roving, etc., a power of 3 horses is adequate to drive 30 large looms with their dressing 
machines" (I.e., [pp.] 62-63 [Engl, ed., p. 40]). a// 
* "Over by far the greater part of the globe, the great majority of the labouring 
classes do not even receive their wages from capitalists; they either produce them 
themselves, or receive them from the revenue of their customers. The great 
primary step has not been taken which secures the continuity of their labour; they 
are aided by such knowledge only, and such an amount of mechanical power as 
may be found in the possession of persons labouring with their own hands for their 
subsistence. The skill and science of more advanced countries, the giant motive 
forces, the accumulated tools and machines which those forces may set in motion, 
are absent from the tasks of the industry which is carried on by such agents 
alone"* ([R. Jones, Text-book of Lectures on the Political Economy of Nations..., p.] 43). 
//In England  herself:  * "Take agriculture... A knowledge of good farming is 
spread thinly, and with wide intervals, over the country. A very small part of the 
agricultural population is aided by all the capital which ... might be available in this 
branch of the national industry... The working in these" //great manufactories// 
"is the occupation of only a small portion of our non-agricultural labourers. In 
country workshops, in the case of all handicraftsmen and mechanics who carry 
on their separate task with little combination, there the division of labour is 
incomplete, and its continuity consequently imperfect... Abandon the great towns, 
observe the broad surface of the country, and you will see what a large portion of 
the national industry is lagging at a long distance from perfection, in either 
continuity, skill, or power"* (I.e., [p.] 44).// 
Capitalist production leads to separation of science from labour 
and at the same time to the application of science to material 
production. 
With regard to  rent,  Jones remarks correctly:

Rent,  in the  modern sense  of the  term, which depends entirely 
on profit, presupposes: 
* "the power  of moving capital  and  labour from  one  occupation  to another  ... the 
mobility  of capital  and  labour,  and in  countries where agricultural capital  and  labour 
have  no such mobility  ... we  cannot expect  to observe  any of the  results which  we 
see to arise here from that mobility exclusively" * (I.e.,  p. 59). 
This "MOBILITY  OF  CAPITAL AND LABOUR"  is, in  general,  the  real 
prerequisite  for the  formation  of a  general rate  of profit.  It 
presupposes indifference  to the  specific form  of labour.  In reality 
friction takes place  (at the  expense  of the  working class) between 
the one-sided character which  the  division  of  labour  and 
machinery impose  on labour capacity  on the one  hand, while  on the 
other hand,  it confronts capital //which  is thereby differentiated 
from  its undeveloped form  in craft-guild industry  // merely  as the 
living potentiality  of any  type  of labour  in general, which  is given 
this or that direction according  to the  profit that  can be  made  in 
this or that sphere  of production,  so that different masses  of 
labour  are  transferable from  one  sphere  to another. 
In Asia,  etc.,  * "the body  of the  population consists  of labouring peasants; 
systems  of cultivation [XVIII-1153] imperfectly developed, afford long intervals  of leisure. 
As the  peasant produces  his own  food,  he also produces most  of the  other primary 
necessities which  he consumes  ... his  dress,  his  implements,  his  furniture, even  his 
buildings;  for  there  is in  this class little division  of occupations.  The  fashions  and 
habits  of such  a people  do not  change; they  are  handed down from parents  to 
children; there  is nothing  to alter  or disturb them" *  ([p.] 97). 
On the  other hand,  the  capitalist production, whose characteris­
tic features are  MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND LABOUR  and continual  REVOLU­
TIONS  in the  modes  of production,  and  therefore  in the  relations 
of production  and  commerce  and the way of  life, leads  to great 
MOBILITY  IN THE HABITS, MODES OF THINKING,  etc., of the  PEOPLE. 
Compare  the  following with  the  above-quoted passage about  the 
"INTERVALS  OF  LEISURE"  and the  "IMPERFECTLY DEVELOPED SYSTEMS  OF  CULTIVA­
TION". 
* "Where  a steam engine  is employed  on a  farm,  it forms part  of a  system which 
employs most labourers  in agriculture,  and [is] in all  cases [associated] with  a 
reduction  [in the  number]  of horses" ("[On]  the  Forces used  in Agriculture".  [A] 
Paper read  by Mr.  John  C. Morton  at the  Society  of Arts  [on  December  7,] 
I860199).*  And 
* "The difference  of time required  to complete  the  products  of agriculture,  and 
of other species  of labour,  is the  main cause  of the  great dependence  of the 
agriculturists. They cannot bring their commodity  to market  in less time than  a 
year.  For  that whole period they  are  obliged  to borrow from  the  shoemaker,  the 
tailor,  the  smith,  the  wheelwright,  and the  various other labourers, whose products 
they want  and  which  are  completed  in a few  days  or weeks. Owing  to this natural 
circumstance,  and  owing  to the  more rapid increase  of the  wealth produced  by 
other labour than that  of agriculture,  the  monopolisers  of all the  land, although

they have also monopolised legislation,  are  unable  to save themselves  and  their 
servants,  the  farmers, from becoming  the  most dependent class  of men in the 
community" (Hodgskin, Popular Political Economy,  p. 147,*  note).200 
The capitalist differs from capital  in that  he  must live,  and 
therefore must consume part  of the  SURPLUS VALUE  as revenue, daily 
and hourly. Thus,  the  longer  the  period  of production before  the 
capitalist  can  bring  his  commodity  to market,  or the  longer  the 
period  of  time before  he  gets  RETURNS  from  the  sale  of his 
commodities,  the  longer  he  must live either  on  credit during  the 
intervening time—a matter  we are not  discussing here—or  he 
must  HOARD  a STOCK  OF MONEY  as large as he spends as revenue. He 
must advance  his own  revenue  for a  longer period.  His  capital 
must  be  larger.  He is  obliged  to leave  a part  of it  always unused, 
as a consumption fund.  //In  small-scale farming, therefore, 
domestic industry  is combined with agriculture; supplies  for the 
year, etc.// 
We now  come  to Jones' teaching  on  accumulation.  His  original 
contribution  so far has  been that  it is by no  means necessary  for 
accumulation  to  arise from profit;  and  secondly, that  THE 
ACCUMULATION  OF  AUXILIARY CAPITAL DEPENDS UPON  THE  ADVANCE  OF  KNOWLEDGE. 
He limits the latter to the discovery of new  MECHANICAL APPLIANCES, 
MOTIVE FORCES,  etc. But it is true in general. For example, if corn is 
used  as raw  material  in the  preparation  of spirits, then  a NEW SOURCE 
OF ACCUMULATION  is opened up,  BECAUSE  THE  SURPLUS PRODUCE  MAY  BE 
CONVERTED INTO  NEW  FORMS, SATISFY  NEW  WANTS,  AND  ENTER  AS A PRODUCTIVE 
ELEMENT INTO  A NEW  SPHERE  OF PRODUCTION.  The same applies if starch, 
etc., is prepared from corn.  The  sphere  of  exchange  of these 
particular commodities  and of all  commodities  is thereby  ex­
panded.  The  same takes place when coal  is used  for  lighting,  etc. 
Foreign trade, too, is of course a  GREAT AGENT  IN THE  PROCESS  OF 
ACCUMULATION,  because  it tends  to increase  the  variety  of use values  and 
the volume  of commodities. 
What Jones says first  of all is  concerned with  the  connection 
between accumulation  and the  rate of profit.  (He is by no  means very 
clear about  the  origin  of the  latter.) 
* "The power  of a  nation  to accumulate capital from profits does  not vary with  the 
rate of profit  ... on the  contrary,  the  power  to accumulate capital from profits 
ordinarily varies inversely  as the  rate of profit,  that  is, it is  great where  the  rate  of 
profit  is low, and  small where  the  rate  of profit  is high" * ([Jones, Text-book  of 
Lectures...,  p.] 21).  Adam Smith says: [XVIII-1154]  * "Though that part  of the 
revenue  of the  inhabitants which  is derived from  the  profits  of stock  is always 
much greater  in rich, than  in poor, countries,  it is  because the stock  is much greater;  in 
proportion  to the stock,  the  profits  are  generally much less" ( Wealth  of Nations, Vol.  II, 
Ch. 3 [p.  406]). 

=====第377页=====
Richard Jones 367 
"In England  and  Holland,  the rate of profit  is lower than  in any  other part  of 
Europe"  ([p.] 21).  "During  the  period  in which  her"  (England's) "wealth  and 
capital have been increasing  the  most rapidly,  the  rate  of profit  has  been gradually 
declining" ([pp.] 21-22).  "The  relative masses  of the profits produced  ... depend  not 
alone  on the rate of profit  ... but on  the rate  of profit taken  in combination with the relative 
quantities  of capital employed"  ([p.] 22).  "The  increasing quantity  of capital  of the 
richer nation  ... is  also usually accompanied  by a  decrease  in the  rate of profits,  or 
a decrease  in the  proportion, which  the  annual revenue derived from  the  capital 
employed, bears  to its  gross amount" (I.e.).  "If it be  said that  all  other things being 
equal,  the  rate of profit will determine  the power  of accumulating from profit,  the  answer 
is, that  the  case,  if practically possible,  is too  rare  to deserve consideration.  We 
know, from observation, that  a declining rate  of profit  is the  usual accompaniment 
of increasing differences  in the mass  of capital employed  by different nations,  and  that, 
therefore, while  the  rate of profit  in the  richer nations declines,  all other things  are 
not equal.  If it be  asserted that  the  decline  of profits  may  be great enough  to make 
it impossible  to accumulate from profits  at all, the  answer  is, that  it would  be 
foolish  to argue  on the  assumption  of such  a decline, because long before  the  rate 
of profits  had  reached such  a point, capital would  go  abroad  to realise greater 
profits elsewhere,  and  that the  power  of exporting will always establish some limit 
below which profits will never fall  in any one  country, while there  are others  in which 
the [rate  of]  profit  is greater"* ([pp.] 22-23). 
"Apart from  the  PRIMARY SOURCES  OF  ACCUMULATION,  [there  are]  DERIVATIVE 
ONES,  such  as, for  example,  the  OWNERS  OF [the]  NATIONAL DEBT,  officials,  etc." 
([p.] 23). 
ALL THIS  IS bel et  bon. 3 It is  quite correct that  the  amounts 
ACCUMULATED  by no  means depend solely  on the  rate  of profit,  but 
on the  rate  of profit multiplied  by the  capital employed, that  is, 
just as much  on the  size  of the  capital advanced.  If the  capital 
employed=C,  and the  rate  of  profit=r, then accumulation  = Cr, 
and it is  clear that this product  can  increase  if C  grows more 
quickly than  r declines.  And  this  is indeed  A  FACT DERIVED FROM 
OBSERVATION.  But  this does  not  explain  the  cause,  the  raison d'être,  of 
this  FACT.  Jones himself came very near  to it  when  he  made  the 
observation that  the  AUXILIARY CAPITAL  continuously increases  RELATIVE­
LY TO THE  WORKING POPULATION BY WHICH  IT IS PUT  INTO MOTION. 
In so far as the  decline  in profit  is due to the  cause mentioned 
by Ricardo —the  RISE  OF RENT—the  ratio  of the  total  SURPLUS VALUE  to 
the capital employed remains unchanged.  But one  part  of 
it—RENT—increases,  at the  expense  of the  other part,  i.e. of  PROFIT; 
this leaves  the  proportion  of the  total  SURPLUS VALUE,  of which  PROFIT, 
INTEREST  AND  RENT  are  only categories,  [to the  total capital]  un­
changed. Thus,  in fact, Ricardo denies  the  phenomenon  itself. 
On the  other hand,  the  mere decline  in the  rate  of interest 
proves nothing  in itself,  just  as its  rise proves nothing, although  it 
does indeed always indicate  the  MINIMUM RATE  below which profit 
a Well  and  good.— Ed.

cannot fall. For profit must always be higher than the AVERAGE [rate 
of] INTEREST. 
[XVIII-1155] Apart from the terror which the law of the 
declining rate of profit inspires in the economists, its most 
important corollary is the presupposition of a constantly increasing 
concentration of capitals, that is, a constantly increasing decapital-
isation of the smaller capitalists. This, on the whole, is the result of 
all laws of capitalist production. And if we strip this fact of the 
contradictory character which, on the basis of capitalist produc­
tion, is typical of it, what does this fact, this trend towards 
centralisation, indicate? Only that production loses its private 
character and becomes a social process, not formally—in the sense 
that all production subject to exchange is social because of the 
absolute dependence of the producers on one another and the 
necessity for presenting their labour as abstract social labour ([by 
means of] money)—but in actual fact. For the means of 
production are employed as communal, social means of produc­
tion and therefore not [determined] by [the fact that they are] the 
property of an individual, but by their relation to production, and 
the labour likewise is performed on a social scale. 
A separate section in Jones' work is headed "[On the] CAUSES 
WHICH DETERMINE THE INCLINATION TO ACCUMULATE". 
*"1) Differences of temperament and disposition in the people. 
"2) Differences in the proportions in which the national revenues are divided 
among the different classes of the population. 
"3) Different degrees of security for the safe enjoyment of the capital saved. 
"4) Different degrees of facility in investing profitably, as well as safely, 
successive savings. 
"5) Differences in the opportunities offered to the different ranks of the 
population to better their positions by means of savings" * ([p.] 24). 
All these 5 causes, in fact, boil down to this—that accumulation 
depends on the stage of the capitalist mode of production reached by 
a particular nation. 
D'abord No. 2. Where capitalist production exists in a developed 
form, profit constitutes the chief SOURCE of accumulation, that is, 
the capitalists have concentrated the greater part of the NATIONAL 
REVENUE in their hands and even a section of the LANDLORDS seeks to 
capitalise [their revenue]. 
No. 3. Security (in the legal and police sense) increases in 
proportion to the degree to which the capitalists secure control of 
the state administration. 
No. 4. As capital develops, the spheres of production increase 
on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the organisation of 

=====第379页=====

credit [develops]  in order  to collect every  FARTHING  in the  hands  of 
the MONEY-LENDERS  (bankers). 
No. 5). In  capitalist production,  the  improvement  of  one's 
position depends solely  on  money,  and  everyone  can  delude 
himself into believing that  he can  become  a Rothschild. 
There remains  No. 1). All  peoples  do not  have  the  same 
predisposition towards capitalist production. Some primitive 
peoples, such  as the  Turks, have neither  the  temperament  nor the 
DISPOSITION  to it. But  these  are  exceptions.  The  development  of 
capitalist production creates  an  AVERAGE  level  of bourgeois society 
and therefore  an  average level  of temperament  and  disposition 
amongst  the  most varied peoples.  [It is] as  truly cosmopolitan  as 
Christianity. This  is why  Christianity  is likewise  the  special religion 
of capital.  In  both  it is  only  men who  count.  One man in the 
abstract  is worth just  as much  or as  little  as the  next  man. In the 
one case,  all depends  on  whether  or not he has  faith,  in the  other, 
on whether  or not he has  credit.  In addition, however,  in the one 
case,  predestination  has to be  added,  and in the  other case,  the 
accident  of whether  or not a man is  born with  a silver spoon  in his 
mouth. 
The source  of surplus value  and  PRIMITIVE  RENT  : 
* "When land  has  been appropriated  and  cultivated, such land yields,  in almost 
every case,  to the  labour employed  on it,  more  than is  necessary  to continue  the kind 
of cultivation already bestowed upon  it. Whatever  it produces  [XVIII-1156]  beyond 
this, we will call its  surplus  produce.  Now this surplus produce  is the source  of primitive 
rents,  and  limits  the extent  of such revenues,  as can be  continuously derived from 
the land  by its  owners,  as distinct from  its occupiers"*  ([p.] 19). 
These  PRIMITIVE RENTS  are the  first social form  in which  SURPLUS 
VALUE  is represented,  and  this  is the  obscure conception which 
forms  the  foundation  of the  theory  of the  Physiocrats. 
Both absolute  and  relative  SURPLUS VALUE  have this  in common that 
they presuppose  a certain level  of the  productive power  of labour. 
If the  entire working  day  (available labour time)  of a man (any 
man) were only sufficient  to feed himself  (and at  best  his  FAMILY  as 
well),  then there would be no  SURPLUS  LABOUR,  SURPLUS  VALUE  and  SURPLUS 
PRODUCE.  This prerequisite  of a  certain level  of productive power  is 
based  on the  natural productiveness  of  land  and  water,  the 
NATURAL SOURCES OF WEALTH.  It is different in different countries, etc. 
Needs  are  simple  and  crude  in  early times  and the  MINIMUM 
PRODUCE  required  for the  maintenance  of the  producers them­
selves  is consequently small,  and so is the  SURPLUS PRODUCE.  On the 
other hand,  the  number  of  people  who  live  off the  SURPLUS 
PRODUCE  in those circumstances  is likewise very small,  so that they 

=====第380页=====
370 Theories of Surplus Value 
receive the sum total of the small amounts of  SURPLUS  PRODUCE  obtain­
ed from a relatively large number of producers. 
The basis for absolute SURPLUS  VALUE—that  is, the real precondi­
tion for its existence—is the natural fertility of the  land,  of nature, 
whereas relative SURPLUS VALUE depends on the development of the 
social productive forces. 
And with this we finish with Jones. 
Dominance of the merchant estate: In the part of London called 
Tower Hamlets, one finds very extensive furniture-making. There 
exists there a division of labour, in the sense that production as a 
whole is subdivided, falls into a large number of mutually 
independent branches of business. One shop only makes chairs, 
another makes tables, another again cupboards, etc. But these 
shops are run plus ou moins 3 on a handicraft basis, by a small 
master-craftsman with a few journeymen. Still their output is too 
large for them to work on direct orders from private individuals. 
Their customers are the owners of furniture warehouses. On 
Saturday the master visits them and sells his product, and [...] b 
there is haggling over the price as in a pawnshop over the loan to 
[be] extended for one article of dress or another, etc. These 
master-craftsmen must sell weekly, if only to be able [to buy] the 
raw materials for the next week. UNDER  THESE  CIRCUMSTANCES  they are, 
properly speaking, merely MIDDLEMEN between the trader and their 
own [work]ers. The trader is the capitalist proper, and he pockets 
the greater part of the SURPLUS VALUE. Along these lines [... the] 
transition to manufacture from branches which were previously 
carried on on the handicraft basis or as subsidiary branches [of 
rural] industry. Thus in Lyons, etc., Nottingham, etc., the trader is 
called the manufacturer, although those MIDDLEMEN ... exploit [... the] 
workers. This is the transition to manufacture or also to large-scale 
industry, depending on the level of technological development of 
small independent production. Where it is already based on 
handicraft-type machines—or machines used WITHIN THE LIMITS of 
[handicraft] production—we see a transition to large-scale in­
dustry.

CLOTHING).  The  land  [is]  covered with timber  [and] is of no use in its  present 
[XVIII-1157] condition  for  TILLAGE. They  go to a  neighbouring merchant.  He let 
them have  on credit—against  the  future  CROP—some  of [his]  capital,  in the  form 
of sugar,  tea,  coffee, flour, corn, potatoes, seed, salt,  PROVISIONS,  winter clothing, 
etc. With this borrowed capital  * each settler begins  his labours,  and  when  the  crops 
are harvested,  the  merchant  is paid  in grain  and  other productions,  and the  settler 
finds  himself,  by the aid of  this credit,  in possession  of a  surplus, sufficient  in part 
to support  his  family  for  another year, which  he could  not  have possibly possessed 
had the  merchant refused  to give  him  credit...*  A large part  *of the  planters  of 
the cotton growing states * receive  * large supplies  of clothing  and  subsistence  for 
their slaves  and of  every article  of their very consumption, upon credit from  the 
neighbouring merchants,  in anticipation  of the  next year's crop...*  As regards these 
COUNTRY MERCHANTS  themselves,  * who  aid the  settlers  and  planters,  few or  none  of 
them have  a capital  of their  own  adequate  to carry  on business  to the  extent they 
do. They  are  themselves obliged  to obtain most  of their supplies upon credit from 
the wholesale merchants  of the  large interior towns  and the  Atlantic cities, while 
those  in  turn avail themselves more  or  less  of credit with  the  European 
manufacturers...  It not  unfrequently happens that  a settler  in [the] remotest region 
of Missouri plants  his  land  and  produces  his  crop  by means  of credit obtained,  it 
may be,  through three  or four successive links, from  a manufacturer  of hardware 
in Birmingham,  or from  one of dry  goods  in Manchester" (Condy Raguet,  A 
Treatise  on Currency  and  Banking,  2nd ed., Philadelphia,  1840, [pp.]  50-52).* 
Richard Jones sums  up  correctly  in the  following passage: 
* "The amount  of  capital devoted  to the  maintenance  of  labour  may  vary, 
independently  of any  changes  in the  whole amount  of capital... Great fluctuations  in the 
amount  of employment,  and  great suffering,  may  sometimes  be observed  to become 
more frequent  as  capital itself becomes more plentiful"  (R.  Jones,  An  Introductory 
Lecture  on Political Economy, London,  1833, p. 52).* 
The total capital may remain the same and a  CHANGE  (decline 
especially) may take place in the variable capital. A  CHANGE  in the 
proportion between  the two  constituent parts  of capital does  not 
necessarily involve  CHANGES  in the size of the total cap[ital]. 
An increase  in the  total  capital,  on the  other  hand,  may be 
accompanied  not  only  by a  relative,  but by an  absolute diminution 
of variable capital and is always connected with violent  FLUCTUATIONS 
in the variable capital and consequently with  "FLUCTUATIONS  IN THE 
AMOUNT  OF EMPLOYMENT".

[V-211] Costs  of  machinery, buildings,  etc.,  when  not  WORKING.  In 
The Times  for  November  26,  1862a  a spinning manufacturer 
points out that his  MILL, EMPLOYING  800  WORKPEOPLE  and  CONSUMING, WHEN 
AT FULL WORK, ABOUT  150  BALES  OF  EAST INDIAN,  OR  ABOUT  130  BALES  OF 
AMERICAN  COTTON,  costs him  ABOUT  £6,000 a year  (ABOUT  £120 a  WEEK) 
when  not  WORKING.  There  are,  first  of all,  fixed costs, which  do not 
concern  us  here  (but  which  are  very important  in practice), namely 
RENT,  the most significant  FIXED COST,  whether the machine  WORKS  or 
not  (RENT  in the above case=£2,450), further  INSURANCE (INSURANCE  OF 
MILLS  AND  MACHINERY AGAINST FIRE  in the above case=£477,  INSURANCE  OF 
COTTON  IN  PROCESS  £123); taxes on this property //  RATES  ON THE  MILLS AND 
MACHINERY,  AS  PAID  IN 1861  (POOR RATE INCLUDED)  £310//. Further: salaries 
OF MANAGER, BOOK KEEPER  and  SALESMEN.  (In the above case £625.) 
Then  WAGES  OF  LODGEKEEPER, WATCHMEN, ENGINEER,  AND  OCCASIONAL LABOUR  TO

MILL,  AND  OCCASIONALLY WORKING  THE  STEAM ENGINE. (£150.) Finally "ALLOW-
ANCE  FOR  DETERIORATION  OF  MACHINERY".  (£1,200, because the machinery 
is already very worn  out.)  With regard  to the  last point,  the 
Lancashire  SPINNER  remarks: 
* "It may  appear  to many that,  as the  mills  and  machinery  are not  working, 
they cannot  be deteriorating...  It is not  intended  to cover  the  cost of the ordinary 
wear and  tear, which  is repaired,  as a  knife  has a new  blade,  by a  staff  of 
mechanics provided  for the  purpose  by  every manufacturer when  his  mill  is 
working.  But it is  intended  to cover that kind  of wear which cannot  be repaired 
from time  to time,  and  which,  in the case  of a  knife, would ultimately reduce  it to a

state in which the cutler would say of it, 'it is not worth a new blade'.3 It is also 
intended to cover the loss which is constantly arising from the superseding of 
machines before they are worn out by others of a new and better constitution. 
From these two causes it is well known that the machinery in a mill gets entirely 
renewed, at the least, once in every 15 or 20 years; and invention does not stand 
still in times like these, being always stimulated by difficulties; nor do the weather 
and the natural principle of decay suspend their operations because the steam 
engine ceases to revolve.  " * 
The same fellow also says: 
* "No doubt a large number (of manufacturers) have ample reserves on which 
they can fall back, but the bulk of Lancashire manufacturers have no spare capital. 
The habit of the trade is to spend in extensions of their mills and machinery their 
profits as fast as they make them, and as a rule they have an insufficiency rather 
than a redundancy of floating capital" * [p. 12].b

"On both sides one must abstract from the number of workers who are

would grow in direct proportion to the number of workers employed. If it is 100 for 
a particular number, it is 200 for twice that number. The new capital is not subject 
to the same laws of growth, for the element of the machine that serves the 
application of the motor does not grow in numbers or in dimensions in proportion 
to the number of workers whose labour it replaces. Hence whatever the superiority 
of the new capital over the old for a given number of workers, it lies in the nature 
of this surplus labour that it is converted into inferiority, in proportion as one 
increases the number of the workers represented and replaced by the machine. If 2 
workers are replaced, it is perhaps more expensive. If 4, 10, 20 workers are 
replaced, it becomes ever cheaper. This favourable result can only be obtained on

quantity of raw materials proportionate to that number. Here again, as in the case 
of a new subdivision of labour, the saving is linked to the prior realisation of an 
additional capital. Each accumulation of wealth provides the means of accelerating 
subsequent accumulation" ([pp. 28-]29).a 
// Firstly.  The situation with accumulation is to be taken into 
account in the conversion  OF  SURPLUS  VALUE  INTO CAPITAL. It should be 
mentioned here that just as accumulation is a condition of 
capitalist production, so capitalist production is a cause of 
ACCUMULATION. 
Secondly: The machine replaces a certain quantity of workers, 
either in real terms, i.e. by taking their place (this is always the 
case when the trade is not new but was previously carried on 
without machinery); or potentially, in that so and so many workers 
would be necessary to replace it If we speak e.g. of the millions of 
workers (see Hodgskin ) who would be needed to furnish the 
amount of production now furnished in the cotton industry, we 
are speaking of the number of the workers who would be needed 
to replace the machinery. It is different when we say that so and so 
many weavers were displaced by the POWERLOOM. Then we are 
speaking of the workers the machine has replaced. This is a big 
distinction. Once machinery has been introduced as the basis of a 
branch of production (with no more competition from manufac­
ture) it only displaces workers to the degree that it is improved. 
But production expands with a given level of PERFECTION of the 
machinery before it attains a higher level. 
If e.g. 10 were employed at handlooms, and 20 are employed at 
POWERLOOMS, and if a POWERLOOM replaces 10 handlooms, then the 20 
accomplish as much as 200 did previously. But they have not 
driven out or replaced 200. The first POWERLOOM drove out 10. The 
other 19 POWERLOOMS have employed 19. One must not say, 
therefore, that productive power has replaced 180, because 200 
would have been needed without the POWERLOOMS. The productive 
power has merely increased tenfold. 
If a new POWERLOOM is invented, allowing 10 to do as much as 20, 
the 20 would be replaced by the 10, or 10 thrown out of work. If 
the number of these POWERLOOMS grew in turn to 20, 20 would be 
employed. And 40 would have been necessary on the previous 
scale. And 400 on the original scale. But the 400 men, who never 
existed, have not been replaced. The first POWERLOOM drove out 10 
and second 2. Thus the productive power has grown in the 
proportion 20:1.

tions).—  Ed.

At any rate there has thus been a twentyfold increase in the 
productive power. If this development had taken place in all 
branches, the worker would have needed 20 times less time to 
reproduce his means of subsistence. Thus if it was 11 hours 
initially, it is now n/2o of an hour, and all the remaining part of his 
working day,  1 l9/2o  hours, belongs to the capitalist. But the 
development is not uniform and all-embracing. 
It should further be remarked: the amount of surplus labour is 
determined not by the workers replaced by the machine but by the 
workers employed by it. This is precisely what Cherbuliez forgets. 
The productivity of the machine (and its cheapness) is not only 
determined by the quantity of workers it replaces, but also by the 
quantity of workers whose labours it assists. Or the expressions are 
in [V-213] SOME RESPECT identical.// 
// In so far as machine labour curtails the labour time needed to 
produce a particular commodity, hence increases the quantity of 
commodities which are produced in the same labour time, 2 things 
are possible. The commodity enters into the consumption of the 
workers. Then, leaving aside what we developed previously,2 there 
is an increase in the amount of labour which can be applied to 
produce commodities that do not enter into the consumption of 
the workers; in which SURPLUS LABOUR can therefore be represented. 
This extends the basis, UPON WHICH CAN [be]  REARED  A LARGER  UPPER  CLASS. 
At the same time the pleasures of this CLASS. But there is also an 
extension of the basis, UPON WHICH CAN [be] REARED A LARGER WORKING 
CLASS,  or the amount of living material on whose EXERTIONS the UPPER 
CLASS  IS REARED. If, secondly, the commodity does not enter into the 
consumption of the workers, there is either a cheapening of 
pleasures or a setting free of labour for NEW FIELDS OF EXERTION.// 
Distribution of the value of the machinery,  BUILDINGS,  etc., over the 
quantity of commodities produced. 
Constant capital, in so far as its relative magnitude of 
value—proportionately to the total capital—enters as a determin­
ing factor into the rate of profit, is to be left out of account 
entirely in examining surplus value as such. We have therefore 
regarded it as c, of indifferent magnitude, both in the section on 
absolute surplus value and in dealing with cooperation, division of 
labour, etc.c In examining machinery, however, we are compelled 
to concern ourselves especially with constant capital. Nevertheless,

376 Relative Surplus Value 
there is no inconsistency here. Two points should be made about 
this: 
1) Relative surplus value can be created only in so far as the 
commodities entering into the consumption of the workers (means 
of subsistence) are cheapened; hence the value of these com­
modities is reduced, i.e. the quantity of labour time required for 
their production is reduced. And the labour time contained in the 
commodity consists of two parts: a) the past labour time contained 
in the means of labour consumed in the commodities, and in the 
raw material, s'il y en a a; b) the living labour last added, in short 
the labour which is realised with the aid of those means of labour 
and in that raw material. 
All the methods of shortening the labour time necessary for the 
production of a commodity,  HENCE  reducing its value, leave 
untouched the value of the raw material which enters into 
production. (There is at most a saving of it given labour on a 
larger scale.) This part of the past labour which enters into the 
value of the commodity therefore does not come into considera­
tion at all. What all these methods have in common is that they 
curtail to a greater or lesser degree the living labour which is 
applied to past labour. 
All that remains to be considered now, therefore, is the part of 
the past labour which consists of the instruments and conditions of 
labour (such as buildings, etc.). This PART remains unchanged with 
simple cooperation and division of labour. (It is, inversely, 
cheapened by concentration and utilisation in common.) But it is 
different with the employment of machinery. Here a specific 
relation enters the picture. The curtailment of living labour rests 
here upon a revolution in this part of constant capital, and one 
can say, expressing it very ROUGHLY, that complex, large-scale, and 
expensive instruments of production replace simple and cheap 
ones.  If the commodity were therefore just as much made dearer 
by the machinery (or more so) as it is on the other hand cheapened 
by the acceleration and curtailment of the living labour added, the 
value of the commodity would not be reduced. One component 
[of the value] of the commodity would fall by the very fact that the 
other increased. There would be no reduction in the total quantity 
of labour time necessary to the production of the commodity, 
therefore no production of surplus value. So because this method of 
creating relative surplus value rests on the revolution of a 
particular part of the constant capital, and is thereby distinguished 
a If there is any.— Ed. 

=====第387页=====
Machinery 377 
from other methods, this point must be examined here specifical­
ly. Viewed quite generally, the problem is solved by saying that the 
total quantity [V-214] of the commodities produced by the 
machinery is so large that in every aliquot commodity there enters 
a smaller value component (part of the depreciation) of the 
machinery, buildings and the matières instrumentales 3 needed for 
the functioning of the machinery than if the same commodity 
were produced in the old manner by human beings and their old 
craft tools. But the fulfilment of this condition will in turn depend 
on the following circumstances: 
a) the quantity of commodities an individual worker can produce 
in a given labour time, e.g. a working day, by means of the 
machinery; 
ß) the number of workers who, if the above relation is given, 
simultaneously receive assistance from the machinery in their 
labour; and through whom the value part of the total machinery 
calculated on each individual is relatively reduced; 
7) the difference between the period during which the machin­
ery enters into the labour process and the period during which it 
enters into the valorisation process. E.g. a machine which lasts for 
15 years enters completely into the labour process every year for 
15 years. But only /15 of it enters into the valorisation process 
every year. The total annual product in commodities therefore 
never contains more than V15 of the value component of the 
machinery. 
2) A big distinction is to be made between the question of how 
far the constant capital affects the rate of profit—this is the 
investigation of the question of the ratio of the surplus value to the 
value of the capital advanced, WITHOUT  ANY  REGARD  TO THE  FUNCTIONS  OF 
DIFFERENT  PARTS  OF THAT  CAPITAL—and  on the other hand, the question 
of how far a particular configuration of constant capital (machin­
ery, etc.) lessens the price of the individual commodity, or the labour 
time contained in it (past and present labour). In content of course 
the two questions come down to the same thing. But here the 
same phenomenon is considered from entirely different points of 
view. In the one case we investigate how the commodity //and 
therefore labour capacity, in so far as the commodity enters into the 
consumption of the workers// is cheapened, i.e. the total quantity 
of labour, past and living, required for its production, is lessened. 
In the other case we investigate how the ratio of surplus value to 
total capital advanced (the rate of profit) is affected by the 
a Instrumental  materials.—  Ed. 

=====第388页=====
378 Relative Surplus Value 
revolution in the quantity and value relations of the constituent 
parts of the capital. The latter investigation presupposes surplus 
value; it presupposes the whole of capitalist production (including 
the process of circulation). The former investigation presupposes 
nothing but our general law about the value of commodities and 
the laws that follow therefrom about the value of labour capacity 
and ratio of surplus value to the latter. 
3) The confusion between these questions: the lessening of the 
labour time required for the production of an individual 
commodity (or a number of commodities), and the proportion of 
surplus labour to necessary on the one hand, and on the other 
hand the value and quantity relations of the different components 
of capital, is the source of great FALLACIES. 
D'abord* the main FALLACY. If the essence of capitalist production 
is grasped, it is absolutely no contradiction to say that the labour 
time necessary for the production of a commodity is reduced, but 
that there is on the other hand an increase in the total amount of 
time the worker must use for the production of this commodity 
which has become cheaper. In contrast, this constitutes, in fact, an 
incomprehensible contradiction to the economists who let the 
machine be invented and introduced, not in order to curtail the 
labour time the worker needs for the production of a commodity, 
but in order to curtail the labour time he must provide altogether 
as equivalent of his wage. And especially so, if on the one hand 
profit is explained by the fact that machinery shortens the 
worker's labour time, and on the other hand it is demonstrated 
(Senior, b etc.) that machinery necessitates the prolongation of that 
labour time. 
Secondly: As far as the labour time of the worker himself is 
concerned, his paid labour time is shortened by this, and his 
unpaid labour time lengthened. It already follows [V-215] from 
this that the quantity of labour time contained in a commodity and 
the proportion in which this labour time is divided between 
capitalist and worker are two entirely different things. If the 
capitalist sells a commodity more cheaply, it does not follow at all 
from this that he makes  less  profit on it, realises less  SURPLUS  VALUE  on 
it. The situation is usually the reverse. In addition to this, it is not 
the individual commodity, but the total amount of commodities 
produced in a certain period, that is to be considered as the product 
of the capital.

Prolongation of absolute labour time in the  FACTORY  SYSTEM.3 
The developed organisation  of labour which corresponds  to the 
machine system  on the  capitalist basis  is the  FACTORY  SYSTEM,  which 
predominates even  in modern large-scale agriculture, more  or less 
modified  by the  peculiarities  of that sphere  of production. 
The main proposition that applies here  is that the  SURPLUS  VALUE 
the capitalist makes derives  not  from  the  labour replaced  by the 
machine,  but  from  the  labour which  is employed  on the  basis  of 
machinery. 
Now the  yield  in  SURPLUS  VALUE  is determined  by two  momentsb: 
the rate  at which  the  individual worker  is exploited,  or the  share 
of surplus labour  in the  working day  of an  individual worker,  and, 
secondly,  the  number  of workers simultaneously employed,  the 
number exploited  by a  given capital.  The  introduction  of 
machinery lessens  the  latter moment, while  it raises  the  former.  It 
raises  the  surplus labour time  of the  individual worker,  but it 
lessens  the  number  of workers simultaneously exploited  by a 
particular capital.  The  same method, therefore, which  has a 
tendency  to raise  the  rate of SURPLUS  VALUE,  has at the  same time  the 
antagonistic tendency  to weaken  the  other moment, which acts 
equally  to determine  the  amount  of surplus value. 
If each  of 20  workers works  for 12  hours,  2 hours  of which  is 
SURPLUS  VALUE,  the  amount  of  SURPLUS  VALUE=2X20=40  hours  of 
labour  ( = 3 working days  of 12  hours each plus  4 hours).  If each 
of 10 workers works  12 hours,  4 hours  of which  is SURPLUS  LABOUR, 
the amount  of  SURPLUS  VALUE=40  hours  as above.  But 6  workers, 
each of whom works  6 hours  of SURPLUS  LABOUR,  will only provide  36 
hours  of  SURPLUS  VALUE.  And if the  same capital  set in  motion  20 
workers  in the  first case  and 6  workers  in the  second,  the  amount 
of SURPLUS  VALUE  would have declined, even though  its  rate  had 
increased. 
This antagonistic tendency  of exploitation based  on machinery 
impels  the  extension  of absolute labour time.  If e.g. in the  second 
case the  workers were  to work  14 hours instead  of 12, and 8  hours 
were  SURPLUS  LABOUR,  the  AMOUNT  of SURPLUS  VALUE  would=6x8=48. 
This reason, which impels  the  absolute prolongation  of labour 
time—the increase  of absolute  SURPLUS  LABOUR,  the  prolongation  of 
the working day—is something  the  capitalists  and  their spokesmen 
are totally unconscious  of. The  phenomenon shows itself once

380 Relative Surplus Value 
machine manufacturing has been sufficiently extended and 
developed through competition for the social value, the market 
value, of the commodities produced with machinery to be brought 
down to their individual value, so that the capitalist can no longer 
pocket the difference. 
This is a driving motive entirely independent of the valorisation 
of the part of the constant capital which consists of machinery and 
buildings. The valorisation motive, as being more obvious, is 
directly present in the consciousness of the capitalists and their 
spokesmen. 
This motive is very simple, and common to all  SURPLUS  LABOUR,  but 
it operates particularly strongly when the value and the amount of 
the capital employed in the means of labour is large enough to be 
predominant. 
D'abord,  NO ADDITIONAL OUTLAY  OF MACHINERY and BUILDING is necessary, 
whether 12 or 24 hours are worked, whereas, if a correspondingly 
greater amount of labour is to be absorbed simultaneously, the 
buildings, machinery [V-216] and TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE MACHINERY 
WHICH PRODUCES THE MOTIVE POWER must be increased in size. The 
commodity is cheapened thereby too. For it is irrelevant whether 
the value of the machinery is distributed over more labour 
spatially, through the number of workers who work alongside each 
other and are assisted simultaneously by it; or this happens 
temporally, by the fact that the same number of workers are assisted 
by the same machinery over 24 instead of 12 hours. 
The absolute reproduction time of the buildings remains 
roughly the same, whether they enter really as conditions into the 
labour process over 12 or over 24 hours. 
The reproduction time of the machinery itself is not curtailed to 
the same extent as its active service is prolonged. But the 
reproduction time of its value is curtailed to the same extent. 
The profit is thus greater in a given section of circulation and the 
profit in general is calculated according to the surplus value which 
is realised in a particular period of circulation, e.g. a year. 
The ratio of constant to variable capital is in general reduced by 
this, because the share of the most important part of the constant 
capital is reduced. 
The examination of this last point therefore belongs to the 
theory of profit.4 
Replacement of the tool of labour by machinery. 
It should be noted here that machinery does not only replace 
living labour, but also the worker and the tools of his craft. The 
latter may of course be very insignificant, e.g. when sewing 

=====第391页=====
Machinery 381 
machines replace the usual labour of sewing. This is usually not a 
replacement; the actual WORKING TOOL rather re-emerges in the 
machinery  itself,  even if on an infinitely larger scale and more or 
less altered by mechanisation. 
Conglomeration of workers in the factory system. 
Later on we shall go further into the peculiarities of coopera­
tion,3 as it appears in the factory system, as distinct from both 
simple cooperation and manufacture based on the division of 
labour. 
But here it is to be noted above all that developed machinery— 
the system of production based on machinery—presupposes the 
conglomeration of workers at one point, their spatial concentration 
under the direction of a single capitalist. Concentration of this 
kind is its condition. See the quotation from Ravenstone.203 
The machinery which produces the motive power—and similar­
ly the directing machinery which subdivides and transmits the 
power—is relatively cheapened to the degree that it is applied to a 
progressively larger system of machinery; there is a similar relative 
reduction in the cost of buildings, heating, superintendence, etc., 
in short the objective conditions of labour which are communally 
needed and consumed by the mass of the workers. There must 
correspond to the system of simultaneously operating machinery 
an army of simultaneously employed workers, partly to put into 
effect the division of labour peculiar to the machine system, partly 
to implement the system of simple cooperation, the simultaneous 
exploitation of many people who do the same thing, which is 
characteristic of the division of labour. Hence although the 
number of workers set in motion by a particular capital—and the 
number of workers required for the production of a given amount 
of commodities—is reduced, the number of workers simultaneous­
ly employed and commanded under individual capitalists in­
creases; there is an increase in the concentration of workers acting 
together in space and time. 
Just as the capital functioning in production in this system takes 
on the shape of a great social mass of  wealth,  even if it belongs to an 
individual capitalist, which stands in no relation at all to an 
individual's capacity—however large—for working and earning, 
so the same is true of the system of collaborating workers in a 
great social combination.

382 Relative Surplus Value 
[V-217] Condensation of  labour.* 
If we call the variable capital v, the constant c, and the surplus 
labour contained in the product x, the value of the commodities 
produced by a particular capital, if we assume that the whole of 
the constant capital enters into the valorisation process, considered 
from the point of view of the absolute surplus value=c + v + x 
The methods which raise relative surplus value change absolute­
ly nothing in this formula. Or, the value of the total product is not 
raised by these methods, c may grow, because the amount, and 
therefore the value, of the raw material grows. Ditto, because the 
value of the machinery grows. But the value of c remains 
unaltered. It only reappears in the product. Just as little is x 
altered, v is exchanged in the labour process for v  + x, where v 
represents the labour time which is expressed in v, and x 
represents the excess over and above this,  v + x is the total working 
day. It is not altered by the methods which create relative surplus 
value. Or, in other words: however much the quantity of products 
produced in a working day is increased by these methods, their 
value is not increased, even though, as a result of the cheapening 
of the products, hincb of the means of reproduction of labour 
capacity, the division of labour time into paid and unpaid is 
changed. (The value of the total product of e.g. one working day 
may be increased: e.g. more cotton may be spun, etc. In short 
because more constant capital is consumed in the same time.) 
There is nevertheless an exception to this. And an exception 
which only develops with machine labour. This is condensation of 
labour, or it is so in so far as, owing to the development of the 
social productive power of labour, the intensity of labour, the 
filling in of the pores in labour time, is driven onwards to such an 
exceptional degree, and becomes so much the constant feature of 
labour in a particular sphere of production, that the more 
intensive hour of labour=the more extensive hour of labour+x At 
a certain point what has been gained in extension must be lost in 
intensity. But the same result also occurs in reverse. And the 
replacement here of quantity by degree is not a matter of 
speculation. Where the factum occurs, there is  A VERY EXPERIMENTAL 
WAY TO PROVE  IT: if it is physically impossible for the worker e.g. 
regularly to perform the same quantity of labour over 12 hours in 
the course of a week as he now performs over 10 or 10  V2 hours. 
Here we see the necessary reduction of the normal or total 
a See present edition, Vol. 30, p.  335.—  Ed. 
b Hence.— Ed. 

=====第393页=====
Machinery 383 
working day as a result of the greater condensation of labour, 
which implies a greater tautness, nervous tension, but at the same 
time a greater physical exertion. With the increase of the two 
moments—the rapidity and the extent (the quantity) of the 
machinery which is to be supervised—a nodal point is necessarily 
reached, at which the intensity and the extent of labour cannot 
simultaneously grow any further, the one necessarily excluding the 
other. And in this case, in spite of the reduction in absolute labour 
time,  the SURPLUS LABOUR may not only remain the same, but grow. 
And indeed for two reasons. On the one hand, because the 
productivity of labour grows, i.e. owing to the general law that 
determines relative SURPLUS VALUE altogether. Secondly, however, 
because the more intensive hour of labour now counts as such, hence 
its product e.g.=the value of  1 V2 extensive hours of labour in the 
previous mode of production. The more intensive hour of 
labour—here as the regular, general law of a particular sphere of 
production, not as something accidental and individual—will now 
be reckoned as what it is, as a greater quantity of  labour,  condensed 
as opposed to more porous labour time. As long as the intensity 
grows simultaneously with the extension of the absolute labour 
time,  the worker will admittedly be subject to not only simple but 
double overwork; but the more intensive hour of labour does not 
count as such. It only counts from the moment at which its 
heightened intensity appears as the real, tangible and given limit 
of its extension. 
This is the reason why with the introduction of the Ten Hours' 
BILL there was not only a growth in the productivity of the 
branches of English industry into which it was introduced, but also 
a rise rather than [V-218] a fall in the amount of value they 
produced, and even in wages." 
It should of course always be remarked that as soon as a 
concrete economic phenomenon comes into question, general 
economic laws can never be applied simply and directly. E.g., in 
the matter just referred to, a mass of circumstances come into 
consideration which lie far away from our subject; indeed, it 
would be impossible to explain these circumstances without 
anticipating developments which involve much more concrete 
relations than those we are so far able to grasp. E.g., the rise in 
demand following from the expansion of the world market since 
the discoveries in California and Australia,11 and the combinations

connected with this. The influence exerted, precisely during the 
period of occurrence of the phenomenon referred to, by the 
cheapness and abundance of the supply of the raw material 
(cotton), etc., in a number of these branches of industry. And 
finally the measure of the value, e.g. of cotton, is determined not 
by the English hour of labour, but by the AVERAGE NECESSARY TIME OF 
LABOUR on the world market. 
But leaving aside all this, the English FACTORY REPORTS unanimous­
ly demonstrate two facts: 1) that since the introduction of the Ten 
Hours' Act (later modified to 10  V2 hours) the small, piece-by-piece 
improvements in machinery were on a far larger scale and more 
continuous than in any prior period, and 2) that the speed of the 
machinery, and the amount of it that the individual worker has to 
overlook, have very much increased the intensity of labour, the 
demands on the worker's nerves and muscles. 
Furthermore, the same REPORTS leave no doubt about the other 
two facts: 1) that without the law on hours, the limitation of the 
absolute working day, that great revolution in the running of 
industry would not have occurred, that it was enforced by the outer 
limit set by legislation to the exploitation of the worker; 2) that the 
experiment would not have been possible, i.e. not possible so 
quickly with this favourable result, without the high level of 
technological development already attained, and the means of 
assistance given by the level of capitalist production attained in 
general. 
If all branches of industry were subjected to the same 
restrictions, and with the same success, with an equal rise in the 
intensity of labour, this intensity would count as a  GENERAL  RULE,  and 
not as the distinct property of a specifically determined branch of 
labour. A new AVERAGE normal working day would merely have 
been established. The whole day would have been shortened, but 
also the necessary labour time and the surplus labour time within 
that (ON AN AVERAGE) in the different branches. (An English working 
day of 10  V2 hours is not only more productive, but contains 
perhaps as great a quantity of labour as the 24 hours worked in

The capitalist mode of production in general condenses labour 
time,  or increases the amount of labour provided within a definite 
time,  the amount of labour which is actually  WORKED  IN FOR  INSTANCE  AN 
HOUR or 12 HOURS. This is in fact identical with increasing the 
continuity of labour for the individual worker (for the individual 
worker, disregarding the continuity of the production process, i.e. 
its regular continuance over whole periods of time). Even the 

=====第395页=====
Machinery 385 
formal subsumption of labour under capital brings this about, as 
does the whip in the mode of production based on slavery. This 
intensity is increased still further by cooperation, but particularly 
by the division of labour and even more by machinery, where the 
continuing activity of the individual is bound and conditioned by the 
activity of a whole, of which he only appears as a member, or which 
works, as in the mechanical workshop, with the utter uniformity and 
tirelessness of an inanimate force of nature, an iron mechanism. A 
certain  AVERAGE  DEGREE  of INTENSITY  OF LABOUR—of the real quantity of 
labour which is performed  IN A GIVEN  TIME—and  a relatively higher 
DEGREE  //although in the nature of things it differs in different 
branches of production // than is found in non-capitalist or even in 
merely formally capitalist production, is here altogether a general 
presupposition. It is presupposed for all work, if one speaks of time as 
its measure, and if one speaks of the labour time necessary for the 
production of a commodity. But this is not what is being referred to 
here. 
Just as little is it the greater (or different) performance of the 
same labour in the same time, according to the degree to which 
skill, etc., has been developed through the division of labour and 
TRANSMITTED  SKILL, and efficiency is increased through the aid of 
machinery. These two aspects relate to the higher productivity of 
labour, whereby IN  FACT  the real quantity of labour remains the 
same, and (with machinery)  MIGHT  EVEN  BE DIMINISHED  TO A CERTAIN  DEGREE. 
[V-219] What is being spoken of here is an increase in the 
exertions of labour which accompanies the development of 
productive power; so that in the same time not only more is 
produced, but more work is done, more labour power is expended, 
and indeed above the AVERAGE DEGREE—in a degree which is only 
made feasible permanently, day in day out, by limiting the 
extension of labour time. In this case not only relative but absolute 
SURPLUS  VALUE is created, as long as this DEGREE of intensity is not 
universal. But the latter would presuppose, just as much, a general 
reduction of the working day. 
In any case, intensification of labour meets with barriers just as 
does extension of labour. And these barriers are shown by the fact 
that at a certain point the intensity of labour can only be raised by 
reducing its extension. Thus e.g. if 10 hours is the normal average 
working day, with the corresponding level of intensity of 
labour—or of condensation of labour time, quantity of labour 
which is provided at each moment in time—all inventions which 
made labour more productive on this basis, without increasing the 
tension of the labour  itself,  would only raise relative surplus value.

386 Relative Surplus Value 
But if a new condensation of labour time were linked to this 
development of the productive forces, so that the quantity of 
labour grew in the same time, and not only the productivity of 
that labour, a point would soon be reached at which the overall 
working day would have to be shortened again. 
It is only capital's shameless and ruthless lack of moderation, 
impelling it to go beyond the natural limits of labour time into the 
realms of madness, whereby the labour also silently becomes more 
intensive and strained with the development of the productive 
forces, that forcibly compels even the society which rests on 
capitalist production (in this connection the rebellion of the 
working class itself is of course the main driving force) to restrict 
the normal working day within firmly fixed limits. This first 
occurs as soon as capitalist production has emerged from the 
crude and boisterous years of its adolescence and created a 
material basis for  itself.  Capital's reaction to this forcible restriction 
of labour time is a greater condensation of labour, which for its 
part in turn brings about a new curtailment of absolute labour 
time AT  A CERTAIN POINT. This tendency to replace EXTENT by DEGREE 
only emerges at a higher level of development of production. This 
is in a certain sense a condition for social progress. Free time is 
created in this way for the worker as well, and the intensity of a 
particular kind of labour therefore does not remove the possibility 
of activity in another direction; this can on the contrary function, 
appear, as a relaxation from it. Hence the extraordinarily 
beneficial consequences—statistically demonstrated—of this pro­
cess for the physical, moral, and intellectual amelioration of the 
WORKING CLASSES in England.204 
As we have often repeated, we always proceed, in our whole 
development, from the assumption that commodities, and there­
fore also labour capacity, are always paid for at their value, and we 
consider the CHANGES in SURPLUS LABOUR exclusively on this basis. The 
real cuts in wages, etc., conditioned by competition are therefore 
not mentioned here. Thus e.g. the supply of labour is increased by 
OVERTIME, without any increase in the number of workers, or one 
group of workers is OVERWORKED, while the other group is entirely or 
partly unemployed. In this way an artificial OVERSUPPLY  OF LABOUR is 
created, with the result that the supply of those rendered 
unemployed by this OVERWORKING forces down wages altogether (also 
those of the employed). 
This is, on the other hand, one of the reasons why wages rose 
rather than fell in England in the branches of industry covered by 
the FACTORY  LAWS.  Since the demand for commodities rose as a result 

=====第397页=====
Division  of Labour  and Mechanical Workshop 387 
of the  extension  of the  world market,  and, in  particular,  in the 
opinions  of the  capitalists,  the  extent  of this demand rose still 
further,  the  demand  for  labour also rose;  but  this demand could 
not, as under  the old  conditions,  be  satisfied  by  artificially 
increasing  the  supply  of labour,  nor was it  possible thereby  to 
paralyse  its effects  on wages. 
[The] supply  of workers also fell  off very considerably;  in part 
through emigration from England,  in part through  the  Irish 
exodus  and  pestilence.205 
[XIX-1159] a9 One  example  of the  condensation  of labour  is 
work that  is not  practised  at factories,  e.g.  tailoring  in London. 
During certain months  of the  year there  is both  the  greatest 
possible extension  of the  working  day, and the  work  is carried  on 
at a feverish rate.*  For the  rest of the  year  the  tailors  are for the 
most part unemployed  or only partially employed.  The  necessary 
labour time—hinc wages—is  not  determined  by the  labour time  in 
this period  of the  paroxysm  of labour,  but is  rather calculated  on 
the AVERAGE labour time,  and the  wage thus obtained therefore also 
covers  a great part  of the  whole year's income. Here  the 
condensation  of labour  is bound  up  with  the  extension  of the 
working  day, but the  whole working period  is restricted  e.g. to a 
few months  or  weeks.  One of the  most miserable forms  of 
exploitation  of labour. These  are  periods  of feverish labour, 
alternating with chronic slackness  and  unemployment.

It is one of the main results of the division of labour that 
instruments or tools which belong to the same species of purpose, 
e.g. cutting instruments, boring instruments, compressing instru­
ments, etc., should become differentiated, specialised and sim­
plified. One only needs to observe, e.g., the infinite variety of forms 
assumed by the knife, once each particular way of using it has 
been given a form which corresponds to this particular purpose 
and this purpose alone! It happens that once this kind of 
labour—rather the different forms of labour which work together 
to create a particular product, a specific commodity—has been 
divided up, the ease with which it can be performed depends on 
particular modifications of the instruments which formerly served 
different purposes. The direction taken by these alterations is 
determined by experience and by the specific difficulties put in 
the way by the unchanged form. This differentiation, specialisa­
tion, and simplification of the means of labour therefore originates 
spontaneously with the division of labour  itself,  without any need 
for a prior insight into the laws of mechanics, etc. Darwin, see 
above, makes the same remark on specialisation and differentia­
tion in the organs of living beings. 
Differentiation—difference of forms and crystallisation of these 
forms.  Specialisation, that the instrument which now only serves a 
particular purpose is only effective in the hands of labour which is 
itself differentiated. Both things imply the simplification of the 
instruments, which only have to serve now as the means of a 
simple and uniform operation. 
The differentiation, specialisation and simplification of the 
instruments of labour given by the division of labour in the system 
of manufacture based on it—their  EXCLUSIVE  ADAPTATION  TO VERY  SIMPLE 
OPERATIONS—is  one of the technological, material prerequisites for 
the development of machinery as an element which revolutionises 
the mode of production and the relations of production. 
[XIX-1160] In one sense Babbage is therefore right to say: 
"While  the division of labour has reduced each particular  process  to the use of  some 
simple  tool, the union of all these  tools,  actuated by one moving power, constitutes a 
machine"  (Babbage, Traité sur l'économie des machines etc.,  Paris,  1833 [p. 230]). a 
What we stress here is not only the reduction of "each particular 
process to the use of some simple tool", but also something which 
is involved in this, the creation of  these  simple tools arising out of the 
division of labour.

One finds the view, both in English textbooks on mechanics and 
in works on political economy, that a machine is not essentially 
different from a TOOL or instrument; that the latter is A SIMPLE 
MACHINE and the machine  A COMPLICATED TOOL, or that they are only to 
be distinguished as simple and complex machinery.3 In this sense, 
indeed, even the elementary mechanical forms, such as lever, 
inclined plane, pulley, screw, wedge, wheel, etc., are called 
machines. 
But it is not in this sense that Babbage calls the machine, in the 
passage quoted above, a "union of all these tools, actuated by one 
moving power". He is not speaking here of the mere combination 
of different elementary mechanical forms, such as those men­
tioned above. There is hardly even a simple tool which is not a 
combination of several of these forms. Babbage speaks here rather 
of the union, the combination, of all the different instruments 
which e.g. within the manufacture of the same commodity are 
appropriate to different, separate modes of operation and 
therefore to different workers; and also of the setting in motion of 
this combination of instruments by a single motor, whatever this 
motor might be, whether the human hand and foot, animal 
power, elemental forces, or an automatic mechanism (mechanical 
propulsion). 
Other people, in contrast, draw the line of demarcation between 
machine and tool by saying that in the case of the tool the motive 
power is human, but with the machine the power is provided by a 
natural force alien to man (a force which does not dwell within the 
human being as an individual quality) such as animal or 
mechanical power, etc. According to this view an ordinary plough, 
e.g., is a machine, while a JENNY, a  MULE  (unless driven by SELFACTORS), 
a sewing machine, etc., and the most complicated mechanical 
looms, are none of them machines, as long as they are set in 
motion by human beings themselves. 
It must above all be noted that what is involved here is not a 
precise technological separation, but such a revolution in the 
means of labour employed as to transform the mode of 
production and therefore the relations of production; thus it is 
something characteristic of the capitalist mode of production in 
particular. 
Historically, two stages in the transition to machine labour must 
be distinguished. 
Machinery by no means always arises from manufacture, i.e. the 
analysis of the labour required for the production of a commodity

into different forms of hand labour divided among different 
individuals. This is only one point of departure for machinery. It 
also emerges, secondly, from tools which had production of the 
handicraft type as their prerequisite, and, during the golden age 
of manufacture in the towns, were at most developed further, in 
the sense that a mass of these tools was concentrated in a building, 
together with the workers who set them in motion, assuming the 
form of simple cooperation. Here the cheapening of the product 
arose in particular from three3 causes: 1) the discipline to which the 
workers were subjected by capital; 2) the common utilisation of the 
general-type conditions of labour, such as buildings, tools, etc.; 
3) the purchase of raw material on a large scale, etc. 
The following should be viewed as the two classic examples of 
machinery which has emerged through these different routes: 
On the one hand, the spinning and weaving machines which 
emerged from the most ancient tools (even if these had been 
somewhat improved in the course of time), without any further 
subdivision of the modes of operation within them, as brought 
about by some further division of labour. If we speak here of the 
division of labour, we mean the division of labour on which 
manufacture is founded, not separation into distinct and indepen­
dent handicrafts. (Weaving, for example, was very subdivided in 
the latter way.) 
On the other hand, there is the construction of the machines 
themselves by means of machinery. The [XIX-1161] latter 
emerged from—and had as its basis, a basis which also underlay 
the production of machines in spinning, etc.—the most complete 
implementation known to us of the system of manufacture 
founded on the division of labour. 
The transformation of industry proceeds historically from the 
first form. It is in the nature of things that only after the 
manufacture of commodities by machinery had attained a certain 
extent did the need to produce the machinery itself by machines 
make itself felt. 
With spinning wheels, where the motive force which set the 
wheel in motion, and through the wheel the spindle, was the foot, 
the part of the tool which came directly into contact with the 
material, the wool, the spindle, had a separate existence, was in 
fact a different tool from the wheel, which the motive force seized 
on. The picking of the wool and its twisting into threads, hence in 
fact spinning, was done by hand, and was only then threaded by 
a Marx has "two".— Ed.

hand onto the spool, once it had passed through this hand 
operation. From the moment when the tool itself took over this 
operation previously performed by hand, hence the tool itself 
spun, the same motive force as set the wheel in motion also setting 
the tool itself to spin, and the worker thus being reduced to the 
role of setting the wheel in motion and correcting and supervising 
the spinning of the tool (e.g. reconnecting broken threads), from 
this moment the spinning wheel changed into a machine, even if a 
machine of the handicraft type—a machine within the limits of 
handicrafts, i.e. a machine which could be worked by an individual 
person; which initially still permitted the trade to be carried on as 
a handicraft or a domestic, or a rural-domestic enterprise (the last 
as a subsidiary occupation of the agricultural population). But 
from this moment onwards the number of spindles was also larger; 
the working machine proper was admittedly still set in motion by 
human power, but partly the way in which this power was 
directed, partly the immediate effect of this part of the machine, 
which seizes and transforms the material, no longer stood in any 
relation to the physical exertion or the dexterity of the worker, to 
the operations in which his hand still had to act as intermediary, 
before the tool carried them further. All his hand now did was to 
assist the instrument by correcting its ERRORS. The instrument had 
become the spinner and the same motive force which set the wheel 
in motion imparted to the working part of the machine a 
movement that "spun". The amount of the product therefore no 
longer stood in any relation to the physical exertion of the foot as 
motive force, whereas the hand came to the operation post festum, 
did not mediate it. Here a mass of spindles were AT  ONCE  set into 
the movement of spinning. The actual instrument of labour is 
therefore a union of many previously independent spindles, 
driven by the same motive force. It is therefore the transformation 
of the part of the tool which comes directly into contact with the 
material that served as the point of departure of the industrial 
revolution, which characterises the capitalist mode of production; 
this was the road from 6 to 1,800 spindles (paired on one MULE). 
With the spinning wheel there were only a few virtuosi (prodigies) 
who could spin with both hands. The spinning machine was not 
really complete until a large number of such machines, a  REUNION  of 
such machines, received their motion from water and later from 
steam. The organisation and combination of labour resting on the 
machinery first becomes complete with the establishment of the 
mechanical workshop, where an automaton sets the whole process 
in motion.

But the industrial revolution first affects the part of the machine 
which does the work. The motive force here is at first still man 
himself.  But operations such as previously needed the virtuoso to 
play upon the instrument, are now brought about by the conversion of 
the movement directly effected by the simplest mechanical impulse 
(turning the crank, treading the wheel) of human origin into the 
refined movements of a working machine. 
[XIX-1162] From the moment when direct human participation 
in production was reduced to the provision of simple POWER,  the 
principle of work by machinery was given. The mechanism was 
there; the motive force itself could later be replaced by water, 
steam, etc. 
After this first great industrial revolution, the employment of 
the steam engine as a machine for producing movement was the 
second revolution. 
If one neglects to consider this, looking only at the motive force, 
one overlooks precisely the thing that marks, historically, the 
turning point. 
Man possessed living automata from the beginning, in the shape 
of animals, and the employment of animal power for the pulling 
and carrying of burdens, for riding, driving, etc., is older than 
most handicraft instruments. Hence if one wished to characterise 
this as the decisive feature, machinery would be further developed 
among the Scythians than the Greeks; at least, the former 
employed these living locomotives to a greater extent. Animals 
were the first to be applied as motive force for the implements of 
labour, tools which have to bring about a definite mechanical 
alteration in the material they seize on, in the case of the plough, 
and much later also water (later still wind) in the case of the mill. 
The first form already belongs to very early stages of civilisation, 
which had not yet progressed to manufacture, but had only 
advanced to handicraft production. Just as little did the water mill 
bring forth an industrial revolution, rather taking up the same 
kind of position alongside handicrafts in the Middle Ages as it 
later occupied beside manufacture, etc. That the use of water 
power to set a mechanism in motion was, of course, seen as a 
particular principle, emerges from the fact that the later factories 
were baptised "mills", and indeed they are still called MILLS in 
England. 
With both kinds of labour it was a matter of one of the simplest 
mechanical operations, the reduction of material, pulverising, in 
one case, and disaggregation in the other. 
If we look at the machines which replace the earlier tools,

whether those of handicrafts or of manufacture, we find (with the 
exception of machines whose work itself consists in movement, in 
changing from one place to another, i.e. transport machines, 
railways, steamships, etc.) that the part of the machine which 
actually modifies the material consists for the most part of earlier 
tools,  such as spindles, needles, hammers, saws, planes, shears, 
scrapers, combs, etc., even if they have received a modified form 
so that they can function as parts of a mechanism. What mainly 
distinguishes them is either that what previously appeared as an 
independent tool now acts merely as one element in a collection of 
such tools, or that it has taken on much more gigantic dimensions 
in proportion to the power of the motive force. But the actual task 
with any mechanism never consists in any more than the 
conversion of the original movement which is brought about by 
the motive force into another form, corresponding to the purpose 
of the labour and imparted to the working machine. 
" Weaving machines: Are on the whole identical to an ordinary loom, or rather 
they consist of many looms, which are set in motion at the same time. They only 
have in addition particular attachments for pulling the combs and shafts, for 
throwing the shuttle and striking the plate. The alterations undergone since olden 
times by the shuttle, with which the weft is thrown through the warp, are not very 
significant. The form has on the whole remained the same" (Poppe [Geschichte der

Mills: 
"First the crushing of corn grains. D'abord probably by hitting them with stones. 
Then a container or mortar, in which they were pounded with a pestle. Then it 
was seen that grinding was better than pounding. The pestle was given a twisting 
movement in the mortar for that reason. This was best done with a handle, placed at 
the stem of the pestle, and turned round and round by a human being, almost like 
our coffee grinders. Thus the hand mill was discovered. At the beginning female 
slaves were assigned to the grinding, later serfs. Later still the pestle was made 
much heavier and provided with a pole instead of a handle, to which horses, oxen, 
or even donkeys were harnessed. These animals continuously pulled the pestle 
which was pounding the corn round and round, while they themselves went round 
in a circle, with eyes blindfolded. Thus there were already [XIX-1163] horse mills 
(molae jumentariae, asinariae b), which were of greater effectiveness than the hand 
mills.  The horse mills were then perfected; the pestle took on a more appropriate, 
initially conical shape, and a more convenient container in which it was turned 
round. In the course of time the pestle was remodelled into a big, heavy cylindrical 
stone, which turned round upon another big stone, and in this way ground the 
corn. The former stone was called the runner, the latter was called the nether 
millstone. The cylindrical runner had an opening in the centre, through which the 
grains of corn could fall, so as to pass between the surfaces of the runner and the 
nether millstone, where they were crushed...

"The invention of the watermill took place at the time of Mithridates, Julius 
Caesar, Cicero. (From Asia to Rome.) The first watermills in Rome were built on 
the Tiber shortly before Augustus. Vitruvius describes one... 
"Toothed wheels and gears, which were connected to the shaft of the 
waterwheel, transmitted the motion of the waterwheel to the millstone which 
crushed the corn" (Poppe [op. cit., Vol. I, pp. 104-07, 109-10]). 
The plough involved absolutely no new principle, and was in no 
way suited to bringing about an industrial revolution. It fitted 
completely into the framework of small-scale production. Here the 
animals functioned as living locomotives, just as they had 
previously done when pulling and carrying burdens. Like human 
beings they are capable of voluntary movement, and man had 
already learned to subordinate their will to the direction of his. 
The movement was irregular, if only on account of difficulties of 
the terrain, and man had not only to lead constantly, but to bear a 
hand himself along with the animal, once the cart became stuck in 
the mud. The connection between the motive force and working 
machine did not involve a new principle either. It was just as easy 
to harness the ox or the horse to the plough as to the cart. With 
the simple application of animal power the principle of voluntary 
movement remains predominant; the purely mechanical action is 
concealed under the cover of voluntary movement, and therefore 
it does not emerge. But it is already entirely different with e.g. the 
mill, where the animals are led or whipped round in a circle with 
their eyes blindfolded. The movement here already appears as 
unnatural, and reduced to a regular mechanical course, the circle. 
To the peasant, old arid new, the animal by no means appears as a 
piece of machinery, but, as Mr. von Haller says in his Restauration 
der Staats-Wissenschaft* a "helpmate". Animals are in general only 
the earliest human instruments, a point already developed well by 
Turgot. b The steam plough presupposes not only agriculture on a 
large scale, but the levelling of the ground, just as the locomotive 
presupposes railway lines. 
The mill in contrast can be regarded as the first implement of 
labour to which the principle of machinery has been applied. This 
was relatively easier than with spinning, weaving machines, etc., 
because the actual working part of the machine, i.e. the part which 
overcomes resistance and seizes the object to be worked on, 
functioned from the outset independently of the human hand and

without further intervention of human operations. Whether I 
pound or grind dried corn in a mortar with a pestle, my hand 
serves here simply as a motive force. Once it was discovered that 
grinding was more advantageous than pounding, and hence a 
turning movement was more advantageous than a movement up 
and down, it was gradually found that the pestle did not need to 
be directly grasped with the hand, but that an apparatus for 
turning could be interposed between it and the hand. With the 
growing size and weight of the pestle, greater force had to be 
exerted on it, and the handle grew in size and was progressively 
converted into a shaft, which was turned in a circle, first by 
human beings and then by animals. There were admittedly 
changes in the form of the pestle and of the container in which it 
worked, and it was a long time before the bottom of the container 
and the pestle were replaced by two stones, of which one turned 
cylindrically upon the other; and it was a still longer time before 
this movement was brought about by the natural fall of water 
down an incline. With the water mill the mechanical principle, the 
principle of the employment of a mechanical motive force and its 
direction by a mechanical contrivance, was realised to a considera­
ble extent, for the water-wheel, which the water seizes hold of, and 
its crankshaft, which transmits the motion to the millstone through 
a system of toothed wheels and gears, comprised a whole system 
of mechanical motion. 
[XIX-1164] From this angle, therefore, the whole of the history 
of mechanics can be studied through the history of the mill. 
We find here, firstly, the application one after another of all 
kinds of motive force, and the coexistence for a long time of 
human power, animal power, water power, floating mills, wind­
mills,  wagon mills (mills on wagons, set in motion by the 
movement of the wagon, for war, etc.) and finally steam mills. 
At the same time we see in the history of the mill the 
extraordinarily slow progress in development from Roman times 
(shortly before Augustus), when the first water mills were 
introduced from Asia, to the end of the 18th century, when the 
first steam mills are seen, constructed on a large scale in the 
United States. Here it is only through an extraordinary accumula­
tion of the experience of generations that there occurs an advance, 
which is even then only applied sporadically, without overturning 
the old method of working. This lay partly in the character of the 
corn mills as a subsidiary agricultural occupation, in the very slow 
extension of the individual machine to form a system of 
machinery, in which the same motive force set in motion several

sets of millstones; it lay also in the nature of the article. Yankee 
land was the first place where there was a big trade in flour, the 
flour trade on a large scale. 
In Rome water mills were still extraordinary establishments. 
"The water mills have even today not yet driven out all the hand and horse 
mills"  [Poppe, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 110]. 
The year 536 (Belisarius) saw the appearance of the first floating mills. From 
Rome the water mill spread to other states [pp. Ill, 112]. 
A further advance in the machinery of the mill was that part of 
the work which was previously separate from the actual grinding, 
carried on independently, was now performed by the same motive 
force and thus mechanically combined with the work of grinding. 
"Originally no one thought about separating the flour from the husks or the bran. 
Then the ground corn was sifted through a hand sieve. The pounded corn had 
already for a long time been caught in a special bin, later called the bolting  house,  in 
the form in which it emerged from between the millstones. Later on, sieves were 
installed in the bolting house, and given a form which allowed them to be turned 
with a crank. They made do with that until the beginning of the 16th century, when 
the bolting mechanism proper was invented in Germany; there a sieve, in the shape 
of a stretched-out bag, is shaken by the mill  itself.  The invention of the bolting 
mechanism gave rise to the development of a special type of fabric, so-called bolting 
cloth,  which was later produced in factories." 
//This is an example of the way in which a new division of 
labour within society is called forth by the introduction of, and 
improvements in, machinery.// 
"Roller milling was invented at the end of the 18th century by Oliver Evans in 
Philadelphia" [ibid., pp. 114-16, 118-19]. 
"Windmills. Invented in Germany in the 10th or 11th century. Only in the 12th 
century were they first seriously made use of. Until then they were rarities. From 
the 16th century Holland was the land of the windmills. Improved by them and by 
the Netherlanders. In Holland windsails were previously used more for driving 
scoops for removing water from low-lying fields" [pp. 130-34]. 
Improvements: 
"Brake bands, so as to be able to bring the mill to a halt suddenly. The post mill, 
or so-called German windmill, was the only kind of [wind]mill known up to the 
middle of the 16th century. A violent storm could overturn a mill of this type along 
with its post. In the middle of the 16th century a Fleming found the way to make it 
impossible to overturn a mill. He made the whole of the mill immobile except the 
top, so that only the top needed to be turned round to point the sails into the 
wind, while the body of the mill was fixed firmly to the ground. Dutch windmills. In 
Germany and other countries it was only in the 18th century that they started to 
imitate the construction of the Dutch windmill, because the post mills were much 
less costly.  The Dutch mills were given foundations, not merely of  wood,  in the shape 
of a truncated cone; soon the attempt was successfully made to construct them 
upon a stone base, which often took a turret-like shape. The roof or cap of the mill 
can be turned on rollers" (it has to be movable, so that it can always be turned 
towards the wind), [XIX-1165] "either with the assistance of a lever which is moved

by means of a stationary winch, or crowbars are used to turn round a shaft; this 
has a drive which engages with teeth in the cornice of the  roof.  Only in the 18th 
century was this machinery perfected to enable easier and more advantageous movement" 
[pp. 135-37]. 
(Holland in the 16th and 17th centuries was the dominant 
commercial and colonial nation; in addition, import of corn, 
large-scale trade in grain, cattle breeding within the country rather 
than tillage, hydraulic projects, the Protestant religion, bourgeois 
development, republican freedom.) 
"Whatever the kind of mill, all its parts were always capable of many 
improvements; people hardly concerned themselves about these possibilities until the end of 
the 17th century. 
"In the 18th century mills were infinitely improved, partly through better 
utilisation of the "lotive power, partly through a more advantageous arrangement of the 
internal parts, e.g. the milling, sifting, and the whole of the gearing mechanism. New 
kinds of mill and new parts for mills were invented, and new theories were worked 
out to secure the optimum layout for the mills. As in machine technology as a 
whole, the theory was often in open contradiction to experience, unpractical, 
wrong. 
"The common hand mill, as it existed centuries ago, and even now often still 
exists on certain large farms, etc., is usually provided with a crank, on which 
human power is exerted. Two people can do the turning together. These mills 
were also not seldom constructed in such a way as to be turned by the pushing and 
pulling of levers. But here the motive power acted unevenly on the mill. This was 
improved through the addition of the flywheel, since the latter continues its 
movement at the same speed even if the motive power becomes weaker for a few 
moments. (Already recommended in the works of Faulhaber (1616 and 1625) and 
De Cous (1688).) The flywheel is placed on the crankshaft, and it facilitates its 
movement and makes it more uniform. The examination of rotary movement in mills 
was useful from many different aspects. It extended not only to the actual 
flywheels and pinions, but especially to the millstones, waterwheels, windsails, in 
general to all the parts which rotated" [pp. 138-40]. 
"Invention of the field mills, wagon mills or animal mills, which could be brought 
by wagon from one place to another. Supposed to have been invented by the 
Italian Pompeo Targone, at the end of the 16th century, for military purposes. He 
was Marquis Spinola's engineer. In the 18th century more sophisticated field mills, 
in which the runners were set in motion by the wheels of the wagon  itself,  while it 
was being pulled along. 
"When the craft of milling was still in its infancy, only a single runner and 
consequently only one set of millstones was set in motion by the main axle shaft, 
which passes through e.g. the waterwheel. Later on the possibility was seen of 
setting in motion two runners, and thereby also two sets of millstones, by the main 
axle shaft, which passes through e.g. a single waterwheel." (17th century?) "All one 
had to do was provide the main axle with a spur wheel, and let this engage on both 
sides with the gears of two shafts lying parallel with the main axle. What was 
needed in addition was to fix a cogwheel at each of these shafts, in such a way that 
each cogwheel could drive its own runner by means of a vertical drive shaft; then 
one had two sets of millstones. But now everything depended on the quantity of 
water, because that intermediate mechanism and connecting gear required a 
stronger motive power. There was very little attempt to arrange the machinery in

such a way as to lessen friction as much as possible, so as to allow it to be driven by 
as small a motive power as possible. People depended entirely on the motive power, 
which was expected to overcome whatever irregularities of motion might occur and 
to make up for the deficiencies of the machine. No precise investigation was made 
into the theory of friction until the end of the 17th century. At most one smeared with 
grease and oil a few of the parts which seemed to come up hard against each other. 
The wheels, the gudgeon pins, etc., benefited from a  correct  knowledge of the theory of 
friction. In the 18th century the theory of friction was reasonably well developed. 
Furthermore, the teeth of the gears were made epicycloidal... Teeth which are 
rounded off into this curved line produce an even velocity of rotation, [XIX-1166] 
they do not jerk or shake, there is much less friction at the point of contact, and 
consequently the motion is much easier and closer to the ideal" [pp. 145-49, 155]. 
"In the period when the first water mills were set up, no attention was paid to 
controlling the water more advantageously, or ensuring that the wheels themselves" 
(the waterwheels) "should be designed and employed to greater effect. The theory of 
hydrodynamics, [developed] by Poleni, in De motu aquae (1717), was of assistance in 
the construction of watermills. D'AIembert, Traité d'équilibre et du mouvement des 
fluides, 1744. Bossut, Traité élémentaire d'hydrodynamique, 1775, a etc. Similarly 
Bernoulli, Euler, etc., particularly in arriving at satisfactory results on the flow 
velocity of water and the  obstacles  to this. Special instruments, known as flow meters, 
were invented in the 18th century for the practical determination of the flow 
velocity of water. The levelling or surveying of water, i.e. the determination of the 
gradient or inclination of the bed of a river, canal, stream and the like was of no 
less importance in water mill technology. Full use of this was first made in the 18th 
century, especially with the assistance of the level or water level. Where rivers were 
not too broad, use was made of artificial gradients. The water is forced into a 
narrower space as it approaches the waterwheel, so as to make it flow faster. The 
contrivance used for that purpose is the millrace. It had long been customary in 
Germany for the water to be made to flow towards the wheel in a more or less 
steep gradient. In France the millers almost always employed the water 
horizontally, and accordingly it had no natural gradient, or no vertical distance 
between the inclined plane and the horizontal surface. Until the middle of the 18th 
century there was no special theory of millraces. After this period the discovery was 
made that the millraces for overshot waterwheels and breast wheels are best built in 
the shape of a parabola... Newton, Mariotte, Johann and Daniel Bernoulli, 
d'Alembert, Euler, etc., made considerable advances in the theory of the resistance 
or thrust of water" [pp. 160-65]. 
(With the undershot wheel the water acts through its velocity, 
while with the breast wheel it brings about the turning effect 
through its thrust and weight, and with the overshot wheel it is for 
the most part its weight alone which acts. Whether it is more 
advantageous to set up one or the other of the wheels mentioned 
depends on the quantity of water and the distance through which 
it falls.) 
"After this a mass of other people endeavoured in the 18th century to derive a 
general law through which the strength of the thrust could be determined. 
Hydraulics and hydraulic technology were altogether enriched in the 18th century 
with many discoveries, which were for the most part very advantageous for the

craft of milling too. The latter, however, followed very slowly after advances in the theory, 
especially in Germany. The waterwheels themselves in particular had been 
investigated more closely since the beginning of the 18th century, with the aim of 
discovering a theory which would enable them to be constructed to the greatest 
advantage. Parent, Pitot, Cassini, de La Hire, Martin, Du Bost, William Waring, 
Philipp Williams, Deparcieux, Lambert, etc. a The theory of waterwheels was 
difficult, hence it was decried as empty theorising, and the millwrights paid little 
attention to it. In this respect too, much of the theoretical work still remained 
reserved to the 19th century" [pp. 165-69, 171]. 
"The second half of the 18th century saw the invention of the Englishman Barker: 
water mill without wheel and trundle. This water mill resulted from the so-called 
reaction machine or Segner's waterwheel. A cylinder, open at the top, is capable of 
turning easily about its axis. A large number of precisely horizontal pipes is 
inserted into the cylinder close to the bottom, and the water present in the cylinder 
can enter these pipes. They must be closed at their [XIX-1167] extremities, but be 
provided close to the end with an opening into the side, out of which the water is 
able to flow in a horizontal direction. If the water now flows out of the side 
openings, the cylinder will turn about its axis in the opposite direction. The water 
exerts an even pressure everywhere upon the side walls of the pipes. But at the 
points where the openings are located, the water finds no resistance and can 
therefore flow out freely. At the points opposite these openings, the pressure 
continues to be exerted upon the walls; and since this pressure is not cancelled out 
by an equal and opposite pressure, it pushes the pipe away in that direction and 
sets the cylinder into rotation. Barker connected the axis of the cylinder to the 
millstones and the appropriate apparatus, and a corn mill was created out of 
this..."  [pp. 173-74]. 
"Mills driven by steam engines. Tried first in England. This was the origin of the 
so-called Albion mill in London, which had 20  sets  of millstones and was set in motion 
by 2 steam engines. It was destroyed by fire on the 2nd March 1791. In the 18th 
century this system was still a rarity. In Germany, in the first decade of the 19th 
century, it did not yet... 
"A water mill was built by Thomas Ellikott in Virginia on the Okkaquam River. 
It performs all the functions of milling almost without human assistance. It has 3 
waterwheels and 6 sets of millstones. No one needs to bring the corn up the stairs 
and throw it into the hopper: the mill itself does this through the mechanism of a 
moving Archimedean water  screw,  which screws the corn horizontally forward, and a 
kind of system of  buckets,  which brings it up to the top floor, and guides it from 
there through the hopper into the area between the millstones. Before being 
poured in it is cleaned by a further machine. After the flour has cooled, the 
machine brings it automatically to the place where the flour containers stand, and 
even pours it into them" [pp. 183, 185, 186]. 
In Germany the nobles at first maintained that the wind was 
their property; but then the bishops challenged them, claiming it 
as ecclesiastical property. 
"In 1159 the emperor Frederick I made water mills a regalian right. The only 
exception for a while were small non-navigable rivers. The regalian prerogative was 
even extended to cover the air. It was already an established practice in the  11 th 
century for ruling princes to oblige their subjects to have their corn milled in the

compulsory mills" [pp. 189-90]. 
"In the first half of the 18th century the Dutch also provide practical instruction in 
the millwright's art" [p. 192]. 
The mill passed through the following stages of development, 
beginning with the period of the Roman Empire, at the start of 
which the water mill was introduced into Rome from Asia Minor: 
Middle Ages. Hand mills, animal mills and water mills. {Windmills 
invented in Germany in the 10th or 11th century. First used 
seriously from the 12th century onwards. Until the middle of the 
16th century the only ones used.) Characteristic that the German 
nobility claimed the wind as its property, then the priests. 
Frederick I made water mills a regalian right in 1159, then 
extended this to cover the air. Privileged or compulsory seigneurial 
mills. Moses said: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth 
out the corn." But the Christian lords of Germany say on the 
contrary: "Serfs should have a big wooden board fastened round 
their neck, so that they can't use their hands to put flour into their 
mouths." 208 
The sole improvement in the water mill: For a long time, the 
flour was caught, just as it emerged from between the millstones, 
in a special container. The hand sieves, which were previously used 
to sift the crushed corn, were now fixed in this container, which 
was designed in such a way that they could be turned with a 
crank. 
Sixteenth century. Beginning of the 16th century, a sieve stretched 
out to form a bag, the bolter properly so  called,  shaken by the mill 
itself. 
Windmills were very widespread in Holland in the first half of 
this century. They were converted from German into Dutch 
windmills. In the middle of the century the Dutch were already 
using wind-driven sails to draw water. Movable top. Stone 
building. Braking  system,  in order to bring the mill to an immediate 
halt while in motion. Mechanical contrivances to turn the top into 
the wind, even if still very clumsy. (The cap of the mill.) Namely

Seventeenth century. With some non-water mills (hand querns) the 
motion was produced by pushing and pulling with handles. The 
motive power acts very unevenly here. The flywheel introduced 
(fixed to the crankshaft) to facilitate the motion and make it more 
uniform. Some theoretical investigations into flywheels, pinion 
wheels and rotary motion in general. 
Eighteenth century. Two sets of millstones set in motion by one 
waterwheel. (This had already started in the 17th century.) Namely, 
a single waterwheel acts on a single axletree, which acts on 2 
runners, and thereby 2 sets of millstones are also set in motion, 
and indeed it acts on 2 runners through side-axles, gearing, and 
connecting gear (see above).3 But now greater motive power is 
required. The theory of friction is developed. Epicycloidal shape for 
the teeth of wheels, gears, etc. 
Investigations into the better utilisation of the motive power  itself,  the

water; whether a certain amount is sufficient for a particular 
purpose, whether it needs to be used as a whole or in part. 
Theoretical writings de motu aquae, h its velocity, obstacles it comes 
up against. Current meters to determine the flow velocity of the 
water. Hence the first measurements of motive power. 
What was further found important (already in the 17th century, 
and earlier still in practice, in a crude form) was levelling or water 
surveying (i.e. the determination of the gradient or the inclination 
of the bed of a river, a stream, a canal, etc.). In the 18th century

determining the force of thrust.) Investigations into the most 
advantageous form of waterwheel. Theory of waterwheels difficult.

Second half of the 18th century. Water mill without wheel and trundle, 
consisting of a cylinder capable of moving easily about its axis, 
open above, and a large number of horizontal pipes inserted into 
it near its bottom, closed at their extremities, but provided with a 
side-opening close to the end, out of which the water can flow in a 
horizontal direction. The principle here is the uniform pressure of

the water on the pipes. If the water runs out at the side where it 
finds no resistance, the pressure on the other side is not cancelled 
out into equilibrium, and the pipes therefore turn. The principle 
is au fond, 3 the same as with the steam engine—movement 
produced by removing the equilibrium of the motive power. 
Milling with steam engines. With this at the same time a system of 
machinery. 20 sets of millstones at the Albion in .London, set in 
motion by 2 steam engines. (Burned down in 1791.) 
Similarly at the end of the 18th century. Water mill as system; not 
only by the combination of 6 sets of millstones, but automatically 
(through the Archimedean water screw). The corn is carried up 
the escalator, it is deposited on the upper floor, it is guided from 
there through the hopper to between the millstones, it is cleaned 
by machinery connected to them, it is poured out, the cooled flour 
is brought automatically to the place where the flour containers 
stand and automatically poured into them. This was built by Thomas 
Ellikott on the Okkaquam River in Virginia. Now the system of the 
automatic milling machine had been perfected. 
[XIX-1169] What drove the Dutch (since 1579 separated from 
Spain as the United Provinces) to use wind power was the lack of 
rivers with any considerable inclination. //A great lack of mines 
for the setting up of actual factories. There were neither smithies 
nor ironworks there of any size.// //The most prominent of the 
trades carried on there were wool, silk, linen manufactures, oil 
and saw mills, paper and dyeworks. Almost all these trades had 
already reached their highest level towards the end of the 17th 
century. Declined from then onwards. // // Tobacco factories. //

Demand for American flour (whereas otherwise they only had to 
supply the West Indies with it). 619,681 barrels of flour were 
exported from the United States in 1791;  1,074,639  in 1793. 
//Here, as previously with the Dutch, the first trades to become 
prominent were closely connected with trade and seafaring. // 
//The corn trade was very insignificant in the Middle Ages, took 
on a certain importance in the 17th century, grew in the 18th and 
19th centuries. One may say that the trade in flour was first 
conducted on a world-wide SCALE by the UNITED STATES. //

Gunpowder, the compass, and the printing press were the 3 great 
inventions which ushered in bourgeois society. Gunpowder blew 
up the knightly class, the compass discovered the world market 
and founded the colonies, and the printing press was the 
instrument of Protestantism and the regeneration of science in 
general; the most powerful lever for creating the intellectual 
prerequisites. 
But the water (wind) mill and the clock are two machines 
inherited from the past. Their development prepares the way for 
the period of machinery, even during the time of manufacture. 
Hence  "MILLS"  a is the word for all instruments of labour set in 
motion by the forces of nature, including the more complicated 
tools in which the human hand is the MOTOR. With the mill the 
elements of machinery are already developed alongside each other 
in a certain independence and extension; motive power, the  PRIME 
MOTOR  engaged by the motive power, connecting mechanism, wheels, 
levers, cogs, etc., between the  PRIME MOTOR  and the working machine. 
The clock is based on the craftsmanship of artisanal production 
together with the erudition which characterises the dawn of 
bourgeois society. It gives the idea of the automatic mechanism 
and of automatic motion applied to production. The history of the 
clock goes hand in hand with the history of the theory of uniform 
motion. What, without the clock, would be a period in which the 
value of the commodity, and therefore the labour time necessary 
for its production, are the decisive factor? 
"Flails already known to the ancients. Threshing sledges and threshing wagons 
(threshing machines) among the Phoenicians" [Poppe, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 194]. 
The water mill, first used for milling corn, could naturally be 
employed on different materials, for all similar purposes, with 
appropriate modifications to the working instrument. In the 
period of manufacture, therefore, it was extended to all manufac­
tures in which this motive power, etc., was employed, either as a 
whole or in part. 
Oil machines. Oil mills, stamping mills. 
"Oils. The process by which they are obtained from seeds and fruits sometimes 
involves merely squeezing out, but more often the seeds or fruits are crushed and 
ground,  and then squeezed out once again. The ancients already obtained their oil by 
squeezing in an oil press or pressing machine [pp. 220-22]. There are many oil mills

shape from the saw of the ancient Greeks. Already in the 4th century there were 
water-driven mills for sawing  wood.  There was already a sawmill in Augsburg in 
1337.  In Norway in 1530 the first sawmill was built under the name of 'The New 
Craft'" [ibid., pp. 33-36].

century. Veneering mills for precision cutting of stained and rare types of wood 
were invented in the 16th century by Georg Renner of Augsburg. (The men of 
Nuremberg and Augsburg were excellent cabinet-makers.)" [Pp. 43-46.] 
Paper mills. 
"Rag (linen) paper seems to have been invented in Germany in the 14th century. 
Straight after the invention of rag paper mechanical contrivances were used for the 
crushing and pounding of the rags. The first paper mills were hand mills, and only 
after a number of years were water-driven paper mills set up, when large-scale 
paper-making started. In the 14th century [they were to be found] in Germany 
(Nuremberg) and Italy. The rag cutting machine first became known in Germany in 
the first quarter of the 18th century... Up to the end of the 17th century the rags 
were merely converted into a pulpy mass by the hammering or stamping of the 
apparatus. Then the paper milling machine, called the Hollander or Dutch machine, 
was invented in Germany. A cylinder lined with a large number of iron bands, 
housed in a strong wooden container, crushed the rags it took up out of a trough. 
It was set rotating by the water-wheel with the help of a system of gears. The 
Germans did not recognise the usefulness of these machines, and paid no attention 
to them. The Dutch snatched them up. They used them as hand mills initially, then 
after some time arranged for them to be driven by windsails. 
"Golden age of paper milling in Holland" [pp. 196-203]. "The Dutch conducted 
their papermaking operations industrially, appointing a specific person for each 
individual assignment in their paper mills. They worked quicker and better than 
the German papermakers, who for the most part carried on the business only in 
the handicraft fashion" [p. 218]. 
The Dutch paper mills of the 17th century and the beginning of 
the 18th century can be regarded as an important example of a 
manufacture associated with machinery, in which individual jobs

1) Stamping and hammering works. 
"The ancients already stamped or fragmented the ore before smelting, washed and 
cleaned it, partly to accelerate the melting, partly to obtain the metal with as small a 
waste as possible. The ore was crushed to a powder in a mortar; this powder was 
then ground in an ordinary handmill, and subsequently cleaned and washed. The 
washing of the minute pieces of ore was done in sieves. Actual stamping works or 
stamping mills, with stampers, which pounded the ore in a stamping trough, were 
invented in Germany in the first years of the 16th century; the iron-shoed stamper 
was positioned close to the shaft of the waterwheel, and the cams on this shaft 
raised the stamper during the rotation of the wheel. At the beginning there were 
merely dry stamping works, i.e. no water entered the stamping trough. But the 
crushed ore gave off such a thick dust during the functioning of these stamping 
works that the workers were physically unable to endure it, and then the 
subsequent smelting process could not progress properly. This situation gave rise 
very soon to the idea of wet stamping or stamping with water. This improved 
arrangement of stampers and stamping troughs had already been achieved in the 
17th century, but the washing works first [became more widespread] in the 18th 
century", etc., etc. [pp. 381-84, 386].

or thick green branches. Later on they used  reeds,  through which the air was blown 
into the fire with the mouth. Leather  bellows,  where a quantity of air was incessantly 
blown out by the simple pressure of the hand from a container to a communicating 
pipe.  Known very early on, among the Greeks. In smelting works too, large bellows 
of this kind were set in motion by hand. Up to roughly the beginning of the 14th 
century. Around this time the first bellows driven by waterwheels. Wooden instead of 
leather bellows, lasting 10 times longer than leather ones", etc., "invented in 
Germany, Nuremberg, already before the middle of the 16th century" [pp. 387-90]. 
"Large hammer works were established in the 13th and 14th centuries for 
forming the metal, particularly iron, copper, brass and lead, into bars or sheets with 
heavy iron hammers, set in motion by the cams on a waterwheel shaft. At the 
beginning very inadequate, like all mills. Only in the 18th century was the shape of 
the cams, the design of the waterwheels, etc., and the blowing machines perfected, 
particularly by Swedish scientists" [p. 428]. 
//Poppe (Geschichte der Technologie) shows how the urban crafts 
(these being independent activities of free men) have developed 
since the 11th century, bound up with trade and science in the 
towns, and how the guilds, livery companies, mysteries, in short 
industrial corporations, have developed together with these crafts, 
politically too. 3 There are many "orders" of this kind dating from the 
12th and 13th centuries. 
"Germany in those days possessed the greatest masters in almost every craft. 
Louis IX of France had the handicraftsmen organised into guilds by Stephan 
Boileau in 1270. Frederick I and Frederick II endeavoured to abolish the craft 
associations, which were becoming refractory. Influence of the craftsmen in the 
towns. All the attempts of princes to suppress the guilds were of no avail. Their 
importance increased more and more. The craftsmen violently demand not only a

the crafts in the Netherlands. The wool weavers play the most important role here. In 
1304 a battle at sea between the Dutch and the Flemings, won by the former. In 
the 14th century conflict between the craftsmen and the urban authorities. The craft 
guilds always had periods of weakness, but always righted themselves. Indeed, each 
craft sets up a complete armament for  itself.  In the 14th century many inventions 
and discoveries. All kinds of weaving, metalworking, working in silver and gold, 
reach a very advanced stage. 15th century. No significant change in the organisation 
of the craft system. At the end of that century Nuremberg the most flourishing of

Some trades, e.g. weaving, were already carried on on a large scale in the 13th and 
14th centuries" [pp. 31-32]. 
"In the 18th century many men of learning set out with great energy to achieve 
a precise knowledge of the handicrafts, manufactures and factories. Some made 
them subjects of special studies. It was only in modern times that the connection of 
mechanics, physics, chemistry, etc., with the handicrafts" (he should have said 
production) "was properly recognised. Otherwise the rules and customary practices 
were handed down in the workshops from the masters to the journeymen and 
apprentices, and thus there was a conservative tradition. Previously, prejudices stood in 
the way of the men of learning. The term technology is first used by Beckmann in 
1772.  Even before the middle of the 18th century there is a treatise on the diseases 
of artisans and craftsmen, by the Italian Ramazzini. A complete technology was the 
work of Reaumur and Shaw. The former put his plan forward to the French 
Academy.  HENCE:  Descriptions des arts et métiers, faites ou approuvées par Messieurs de

Spinning and weaving. 
1) Woollen materials. 
"Before the 10th century the wool manufactures of Germany were the most 
renowned in Europe; the plant nurseries of the Netherlands manufactures. The 
cloth factories of Ghent were already flourishing in the middle of the 12th century. 
Florence, Milan, Genoa, Naples were the most renowned from the 13th century 
onwards" [pp. 243-44], 
"Even the ancients did not convert the shorn wool into thread without 
preparing it first. It had first to be cleansed of impurities and dust. For this reason 
it was teased and willeyed or sorted and beaten, then  washed,  greased with olive oil 
or butter, to make it easier to work, and finally scribbled and cardedP For washing the 
wool the ancients used a kind of soapwort (struthium). 
"The ancients were to some extent familiar with the process of willeying or 
beating the wool, to improve the regularity of the fibres. Subsequently, wool  beaters  were 
introduced for this specific purpose. Nuremberg already had these in the 13th 
century. At the beginning of the 18th century, and perhaps even earlier, the wool was 
willeyed by machine, i.e. a special machine was used to disentangle it: the willey. In 
England more recently improvements were made to this machine  (GIGGING MILLS, 
TOWING MILLS, MACHINES FOR TWITCHING WOOL). 
"Pliny was already familiar with teasing, scribbling and carding, i.e. with 
implements with iron spikes for loosening, dividing and equalising the length of the 
fibres. Such scribblers were now improved, the number of teeth they had was 
increased, etc. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of time continued to be 
expended on this, and many people continued to be used in wool manufactures to 
disentangle and card a large quantity of wool. But these simple implements were 
used up to the middle of the 18th century and beyond. In 1775  SCRIBBLING MILLS

by steam. Richard Arkwright was the man who smoothed the way for this 
invention. 50,000 wool carders demonstrated against him at the Houses of 
Parliament. The machine did the job better, on a larger scale, and more cheaply. 
These machines consist of a number of cylinders to which toothed cards are 
attached; 2 pairs of cylinders with interlocking cards always work together..." 
[pp. 265-69]. 
"Now to draw out the carded wool into a single  thread,  to turn it into yarn by 
spinning. The ancients used the spindle for this purpose. The spinning wheel was a 
more recent invention. The first spinning wheels were hand-wheels, big wheels set in 
motion by the right hand of the person spinning, while the left hand drew out the 
thread. Only in 1530 was the small treadle invented, by Jürgens of Dorf bei 
Braunschweig. A double spinning wheel, or spinning wheel with 2 spools, was also 
invented in Germany. The aim of this was for two threads to be spun at the same 
time.  The attempt had previously been made to see whether one person might not 
be able to spin on 2 spinning wheels at the same time, with long practice. This was 
indeed possible, but operating the treadle was too onerous. In the middle of the 18th 
century there also appeared spinning wheels which simultaneously reeled, doubled 
and twisted the spun [XIX-1173] yarn" [pp. 265-72]. 
"Spinning machines or spinning mills. A machine set in motion by the human 
hand, using a crank, or by a waterwheel or steam engine, which spins 60, 100 or 
more very fine and uniform threads at the same time, and can even be set in 
motion together with the scribbling and carding machines, using the same source of 
power. 
"Spinning machines were already known in the first quarter of the 18th century 
(then only used for sheepswool). Probably in Italy first of all. Arkwright was the 
first to use them for cotton, in 1775. Difficulties were experienced in introducing 
this machine in England from the beginning of the 18th century, and similarly in 
France, even after Arkwright's invention; they were first overcome by the  COTTON 
manufacturers and then by the  WOOLLEN MANUFACTURERS...  [pp. 273-76]. 
"The reel was invented for parting the yarn into skeins, hanks or bundles. The 
common hand reel first. Then the more developed variety of the clasp or number reel. 
Still more developed kinds of reel were connected up with spinning wheels in the 
18th century. They even invented reels which indicated the number of skeins and 
threads with a pointer on a dial... 
"After the invention of shearing and pressing, the teasing and dressing of the 
woollen cloths (stuffs) became so complicated that it could only be performed by 
skilled cloth dressers and cloth shearers, who already belonged to the most highly 
reputed craftsmen at the time of the revival of learning. Gigging and shearing 
machines were introduced into the English cloth factories in the 18th century, 
making it unnecessary for carding and shearing to be done by human hands. In 1758 
Everett introduced the first water-driven shearing mill. 100,000 people who had 
been thrown out of work set fire to this machine. 
"Rolling or cylinder machines were introduced in England, particularly in the 
second half of the 18th century, to replace the customary mangling or rolling of the 
cloth" [pp. 289-90, 292]. 
"Fulling, in order to clean, thicken, and strengthen the cloth, already practised 
among the Romans as fullonum, treading the cloth with the feet. After the 
invention of fulling mills the cleaning of the cloth was separated from the rest of 
the preparation, namely gigging and dressing. Fulling mills were already in 
existence at the end of the 10th century. They are stamping or hammering works.

"Easier to clean cotton than wool. 
"But the operation of disentangling the cotton threads is more difficult. The 
Indians and the Greeks planked or disentangled the threads with the planking 
bow, as hatters plank their hairs. Simple combing, teasing or carding was first set 
aside on a large scale in the middle of the 18th century, when Arkwright invented his 
carding machine. Spindles for spinning in the ancient world and India. In 1775 
Arkwright took out the patent for his spinning machine. 
"... The scutching machine had completely cleaned the willeyed cotton, and now 
it was the turn [XIX-1175b] of the  ROVING MILLS'  which took up the cotton and 
pushed it out at the other end in the form of thick, sausage-shaped threads 
(ROVINGS). The spinning of the cotton into yarn is now performed by the mule, 
consisting of many bobbins, which picks up the  ROVINGS  itself,  and draws out and 
twists them. WATERTWIST,C the less twisted MULETWIST, and the mule  itself,  as 
Arkwright invented it. Soon a special machine was constructed for the  WEFT, C 
leaving the mule mostly for the spinning of warp. The new machine was called a 
JENNY.  Finally, the  MULE  and the  JENNY  were combined together to form a third 
machine, which spun nothing but MULEtwist, and muletwist was now much used for 
spinning the weft. The whole of the machinery, from the carding machine to the 
mule, was driven by a steam engine" [pp. 336-37, 340-42]. 
3) Silk. 
"Several 100 different kinds of silk were woven in France before the French 
Revolution, of which 150 had been invented since 1730 alone. In Avignon there 
was a law that every apprentice might only devote himself to one single type of 
manufacture, and not learn to produce more than one type of material; this was of 
great assistance in promoting perfect mastery of the trade" [pp. 413-14]. 
4) Knitting. 
"The stocking frame or stocking loom was invented in England; with it, one worker 
can knit 100 stitches almost in one moment without needing great exertion or skill. 
The most complicated machine in existence. It is entirely made of iron, and consists 
of more than 2,500 parts. Many hundred needles are in motion at the same time.

collecting mechanical power, either from  the  natural movement  of water,  or of  that 
of air.  Engines belonging  to the  latter class  are  dependent upon  a supply  of force, 
by its very nature uncertain  and  often intermittent,  and  which,  if deficient, cannot 
be increased  by man.  Whereas  the  steam engine  and its  allied machines  are 
absolutely  at man's disposal,  can be  forced  up to any  amount  of activity,  can be set

The best sort, the latest of the modern ones (19th century), the 
"CIRCULAR LOOM of Chevalier Claussen,  * adapted for weaving all kinds of 
looped fabrics, produces the fabrics by means of a continuous circular motion. It 
may be worked either by steam or hand. The great point of difference between this 
and the common stocking or knitting frame is, that the rows of loops are formed 
spirally, and not parallel to each other; the loops are also formed simultaneously 
upon different parts of the circumference of the frame.* The * goods are not liable 
to 'running', arising* otherwise from a  * defect or breaking of any one of the 
loops.  The movement in the circular loom being continuous, and in one direction 
only, and not alternating forwards and backwards as in the ordinary loom, no time 
is lost in the back strokes, and in consequence a larger quantity of work can be 
performed in a given amount of time.* The  LOOM  was shown by Claussen in the 
* Great Exhibition of 185 l.a It has 1,200 needles, placed on the circumference, and 
will with ease make 80 revolutions in the minute. The quantity of loops or stitches

while the weaving were going forward one or two of the threads of the warp were 
lifted or depressed while the others were undisturbed, the cloth then made would 
exhibit a different appearance in that part of it where these disturbed threads 
were, to the other parts. It would show a certain mark on its surface; and if this 
disturbance were occasional, these marks would be repeated at a certain distance 
from one another, and thus a sort of figure would be produced in the cloth. This is 
what the Jacquard apparatus accomplishes... Invention of Mr. Barlow, c exhibited on

submitted to public approval each pen was charged at 6d. At the present moment 
124 may be purchased for the same sum, and of equal, if not superior, quality. In 
1820 the first gross of steel pens was sold, at the rate of £7 4s. the gross. In 1830 
they had fallen to 8s., and the price gradually fell, until it reached the sum of 6d., 
which is its present limit. One of the Birmingham factories produces at the rate of 
960,000 per day, or 289,528,000 per annum. The total production of the 
Birmingham makers amounts to at least 1,000 millions per annum. In the 
manufacture, the steel assumes the most wonderful variety of texture. At first it is 
soft as lead, afterwards it becomes as brittle as glass, and finally it is tempered to a 
state of elasticity as nearly [XIX-1178] as possible approaching that of the quill 
pen*" [pp. 391-92, 394]. 
The Birmingham STEEL  PEN MANUFACTURE IN  ITS ORIGINAL  STATE,  up until 
ABOUT  25 years ago, was the picture of a modern system of 
manufacture, based on the division of labour. For individual 
processes it employed in part machine-like tools, in part machines 
(just as had been done in the original manufacture, once it 
reached a certain height of development) and in part steam-driven 
mechanisms, but with interruptions and hand labour in between.

* "A strip of thin sheet-steel,a of the proper width and thickness, is first 
prepared, by careful rolling and annealing.3 In this state it is ready to be cut into 
pens by means of a press, in which are fitted the proper tools for cutting out the 
'blank'." (Blank* here means the "plate".) * "The use of the press is to give a 
regulated amount of pressure to the tools fitted to it. These presses are worked by 
women, who are so dexterous that the average product of a good hand is 200 
gross,  or 28,000 per day of 10 hours. Two pens are cut out of the width of the 
steel, the broad part to form the tubea; and the points are cut to such a nicety, that 
there is but little waste. The 'blanks' are now to be  pierced,  and here the little 
central hole and the side slits are cut by another press. These semi-pens are now 
placed in an annealing oven to make them softer, after which they are  'marked',  by 
the aid of a die3 worked by the foot, which stamps the name of the maker on the 
back. The half-finished little instrument is then placed in a groove3 and by a 
machine converted from a flat into a cylindrical form. This is called 'raising' the 
metal. The pens are again placed in the 'muffle', packed in small iron boxes with 
lids, and heated to white heat. They are then withdrawn, and suddenly thrown into 
a large vessel of oil, where they acquire a brittlenessa that makes them almost 
crumble at the touch. The next process is 'cleaning', then follows 'tempering',2 
which restores the pens to the required elasticity, and is accomplished by placing 
them in a large tin cylinder, open at one end, and turned over a fire in the same 
manner that coffee is roasted. The heat changes the colour of the pens—first grey, 
then straw colour, next to a brown or bronze, and lastly to a blue. Still there is a 
roughness to be removed from the surface, which requires the pens to be placed in 
tin cans, with a small quantity of sawdust. These cans are horizontally placed in a 
frame,a and made to revolve by steam, the pens rubbing against each other, by 
which means they are cleaned. After the 'scouring' process (which consists in 
placing the hardened pens in an iron cylinder, which is filled with [filings] 
pounded [in a] crucible,2 or other abrasive substance, the whole revolves by power, 
and the friction produces a bright clean surface on the pen), they are taken to the 
'grinding room',a where each individual pen is ground at the back in two ways, at 
right angles to each other, or rather over each other, the quality of the pen very 
much depending upon this operation. By the aid of a pair of nippers,3 the girl takes 
up the pen, holds it for a moment or so on a revolving 'bob' and the grinding is 
over. Now follow the pen to the 'slitting-room',a where it is placed in a press, where 
the process is instantly effected. The pens are next examined, and sorted according 
to their qualities; after which they are varnished with a solution of gum, when they 
are considered ready for sale" * [pp. 392-93]. 
This is more than a dozen operations, to which must be added 
the TRANSFER from one process to the next. 
"It was as this kind of manufacture that *Mr. Gillott of Birmingham established 
the first steel pen factory on a large scale, and the works now carried on in his 
name are the largest in the world for this purpose. Upwards of 1,000 persons are 
occupied at these works, the majority of whom are females. About 180 million 
pens*  were made in the year between May 1850 and May 1851, and the weight of 
the * sheet-steel consumed in their manufacture [amounted] to not less than 
268,800 lbs or 120 tons" (ton=2,240 lbs) [p. 392].

[XIX-1179]  "For  some time  the  introduction  of machinery  in the  steel  pen 
manufacture appeared attended with insuperable difficulties,  for  there seemed  no 
possibility  of completing  a steel  pen by  anything like  a continuous process. This 
difficulty  has,  however, been surmounted,  and in the  Great Exhibition" (1851) 
"there  was  shown  a machine  now in  great  use,  which effects this object. This 
machine  is the  invention  of Messrs. Hinks, Wells,  et Co., of  Birmingham.  It is 
entirely selfacting.  It receives  the  steel  as a  flat ribbon,  and  cuts, pierces,  and 
side-slits  two  pens  at one  stroke, performing  six  processes  at once"  * [pp.  393-94].

Paper  factory.  (Modern.) Earlier this  was a  separate  manufacture, 
very highly  developed,  especially  by the  Dutch,  during  the 17th 
century  and at the  beginning  of the 18th. In  this connection mills 
were employed  in part  for  particular  processes:  first  querns,  then 
water  or windmills." 
Precisely this manufacture was very  DISCONNECTED  in its manufac­
turing  form,  owing  to the  alternation  of chemical  and  mechanical 
processes within  it. 
PREPARATORY  PROCESSES.  "Reduction of the rags, and then removing from them 
all foreign matters, colouring matters included. 
"1) The  first machine tears  the  rags into fine shreds,  and at the  same time 
removes  the  impurities.  It consists  of a  large reservoir, partly filled with water, 
which  is admitted  by a  TAP,b  and  kept running during  the  process. Across  the  VATC 
a shaft runs, which carries upon  it a  wooden cylinder armed with teeth  of steel, 
and at the  bottom  of the  VAT  is a * hollowed piece  of wood also armed with teeth, 
and these parts  of the  engine  are so  adjusted that when  the  rags pass between 
them they  are  caught  and  torn into shreds.  The  cylinder armed with teeth  is driven 
at a rapid rate  by a  band from  the  main shaft impelled  by the  steam engine.  The 
operation  of the  engine  is continued until  the  rags  are  reduced  to a  fine state  of 
division,  and are now  called pulpP During  the  whole time water  is continually 
flowing through  the  reservoir,  but in  diminishing quantities,  and the  impurities  are 
drained away through wire-covered openings,  the  pure pulp  and  water alone 
remaining  at last.*  The  PULP  is now  very dirty"  [The  Industry  of Nations, Part  II, 
pp. 183-84]. 
2) Second process. "Removal  of the  COLOURING MATTER  and  rendering  the  pulp 
white.  If only PURE WHITE LINEN RAGS  are  EMPLOYED from  the  beginning, this 
bleaching  is not  only unnecessary  but  even injurious. * When variously coloured 
rags are  used  or old  writing paper,  and  such like materials, then  the  bleaching 
process  is indispensable.  By a  large pipe communicating with  the  pulp engine,  the 
semi-fluid mass  is allowed  to flow away into  a reservoir, where  it undergoes  the 
bleaching process.  The  pulp  is placed  in cisterns,b  and  mixed with  a solution  of 
chloride  of lime.15*  The  COLOUR  is thus soon * removed,  and the  pulp becomes 
bleached white*"  [pp.  184-85]. 
3) Third process. * "The pulp  is now  pressed  in the  hydraulic press  so as to 
reduce  its bulk"*  [p. 185].

4) Fourth  process.  "It is then again washed, so as to remove the chloride of lime" 
[ibid.]. 
The preparatory processes are often considerably multiplied 
when the transition is made from manufacture or handicrafts to 
machinery—for the sake of the machine  itself,  because the 
material which is actually to be worked on, such as cotton, paper 
pulp,  etc., needs to be much more even in quality, more uniformly 
arranged, for it to be subjected to a purely mechanical process. 
This is then always a repetition of the same process at different 
levels. 
5) Fifth  process.  "MORE MINUTE division is required. This is EFFECTED by »another 
pulp machine, called the beater. This machine only differs from the first in the 
teeth being set closer together, and in the cylinder being made to revolve at a much 
higher velocity.* The operation lasts *some hours, and so much latent heat is 
extricated that the pulp becomes very sensibly warm, and is reduced to the last 
state of fineness. When this condition is attained, the pulp is now fitted for the 
production of paper, and is let off to the vat, from which it is supplied to the 
papermaking machine*"  [ibid.]. 
[XIX-1180] Then comes the actual paper machine, also preceded 
by a couple of other processes, the PULP-METER and FROM THE  METER  TO 
THE STRAINER  [pp.  186-87]. 
The bleaching forms, it seems, a process in  itself,  and the same 
is true of the application of the hydraulic press. The actual paper 
machine, on the other hand, is completely automatic. 
Automatic workshop. 
* "There are two great elements of success completely embodied in this 
wonderful automaton. In all manufacturing arts, one of the most important 
considerations is continuity of production. That manufacturing machine is the most 
perfect, and the most economical, which is capable of uninterrupted productiveness. 
Wherever the material to be manufactured can pass without interruption (and 
consequently without delay) from the first to the last stages of its treatment by 
machinery, there will be in all probability a better article produced, and at a less 
cost, than where at every stage it has to be carried from one place to another. No 
machine yet invented exhibits this more strikingly than that described. It is a 
complete system, for the raw material enters at one extremity, and the finished 
product emerges from the opposite end. 
"In a second point also this machine exhibits its admirable construction, which 
is in its being entirely automatic. It receives no help from man, but accomplishes its 
allotted task by the combination and appropriate operation of the parts of which it is 
made. If assistance is necessary in any respect, it is in order to remove accidental 
difficulties, and not for the purpose of aiding in the manufacture. The action of the 
machine is also very  rapid,  the progress of the pulp from the first strainer to the 
finished roll of paper not generally occupying more than a few minutes" * 
[pp. 190-91].*>

machinery, as when  THE  "BLANK"  in the manufacture of  STEEL  PENS  is CUT, 
PIERCED  and  SIDE  SLITTED  BY ONE  STROKE  [p. 394]. 
(As an  example  of how one  factory makes others  necessary: 
* "In  connexion with  the  steel  pen  manufacture,  a considerable trade  in 
pencil-cases, pen-holders,  and  little articles necessary  to the use of the  steel  pen, has 
sprung up"  * [p.  395].) 
These  are the  final processes  of paper  manufacture: 
"When  the  PULP  is now  FITTED  (by the  second  PULP  ENGINE)  for the production OF 
PAPER,  IT IS  LET OFF  TO THE VAT,  FROM  WHICH  IT IS  SUPPLIED  TO  THE  PAPER  MAKING 
MACHINE"  [p. 185]. 
First process.  * "The pulp  is discharged first into  two  large reservoirs furnished 
with revolving arms  or agitators, which stir  up the  mass  and  prevent  its settling  at 
the bottom"*  [p. 186]. 
Second process.  * "From these vats  the  pulp  is conducted into  an apparatus called 
a pulp-meter. This  is an  ingenious machine  for  insuring uniformity  in the  supply  of 
the pulp  to the  rest  of the  machine.  It consists  of an  arrangement  of revolving 
buckets  in a  circular  box,  this box is  filled with pulp,  and as the  buckets  dip  into it, 
they take  up a  certain quantity, which they then discharge  in succession into  a 
trough3  communicating with  the  first part  of the  machinery.  In all  processes where 
a continuous sheet  is formed,  as in  cotton carding,  and  wool carding,  etc., it is 
found greatly  to secure  the  uniformity  of the  sheet,  if the  machine  be supplied with 
measured quantities  of the  material,  and for  this purpose  it is  generally weighed 
out, and  then supplied  to the  machine.  The  application  of this principle  to the 
paper engine  [is]  new"*  [pp.  186-87]. 
[XIX-1181] Third process.  * "The pulp  is then conducted from  the  meter  to the 
strainer.3  As it  passes along  the  trough,  a little channel  of water from another 
machine, identical  in its  action with  the  pulp-meter,  is added  to it.  This water 
serves  to dilute  the  pulp  to a  proper consistency  for future operations.  The  diluted 
pulp then flows  in a  single channel  to"* [p. 187] 
Fourth process.  * "the sand-strainer. This  is a  trough  in which  a series  of furrowed 
ridges  of metal  are  arranged, over which  the  pulp flows  in its  onward progress.  In 
thus flowing onwards {furrowed ridges3)  it deposits  its heavier impurities, which 
settle  at the  bottom  of the  trough,  and the  pure pulp, which  is of  lighter 
specific gravity, flows forward"*  [ibid.]. 
Fifth process.  * "When  the  pulp  has  reached  the end of the  sand-strainer,  it flows 
down into  a strainer called  a knot-strainer.  It is  very differently constructed  to the 
preceding.  It consists  of a  trough containing  a number  of brass bars,a placed close 
together longitudinally,  and  most accurately planed  and  smoothed. These bars  are 
in a movable frame, which  is agitated  at each side  by a  lever,  and the  bars  are so 
closely  set together  as to  permit nothing  but  the fibre  of the paper  to pass between 
them.  Any  knots which  may  have been  in the  pulp  are  removed  and  left on the 
upper surface  of the  bars, while  the  pulp filters down  in a box  placed  for its 
3 Marx adds  the  German term(s)  in brackets.— Ed. 

=====第427页=====
Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 417 
reception. As these knots accumulate they are taken away by an attendant"* 
[ibid.]. 
Sixth process. * "The pulp is then again strained or filtered, and this time by 
ascension. Passing from the preceding strainer down into a metal box, it is carried 
forward to a third trough, in which bars similar to the last named, but inverted in 
their position, are placed. The pulp now filters upwards through these bars, and 
being now devoid both of all impurities and of all inequalities of texture, it is fit for 
the beautiful process to which it is about to be submitted"* [pp. 187-88]. 
Seventh process. * "Proceeding from the last strainer it flows over a leather lip 
into a little trough containing a two-bladed2 agitator, called a hog. This agitator 
effectually stirs up the pulp, and keeps it from settling down at the bottom. It is 
then conducted on to" * [p. 188] 
Eighth process. * "an endless apron,3 made of perforated brass-wire.3 Here the 
pulp first begins to part with its water, which streams down through the wire into a 
wooden reservoir placed underneath. But this water contains a small portion of the 
finer fibres of the pulp, and the material is too valuable to be wasted. It is 
therefore made to run out of this reservoir into a trough, which carries it back to 
the engine employed to dilute the pulp coming from the pulp-meter with water. 
Thus the waste water from the pulp is used over and over again, and it would 
appear scarcely possible that any of the material should be wasted. The wire apron 
being continually moved forward, receives a continuous supply of pulp, and carries 
it onwards. In passing on with the apron, the lateral edges of the pulp are confined, 
and made parallel by a band lying on the apron on each side, called a deckle  band. 
These bands move with the apron, and the pulp finally leaves them, its edges being 
now tolerably firm and well defined. As the pulp passes along the wire web, the 
latter is shaken so as to facilitate the escape of the water. In proportion as it 
increases its distance from the strainers, the pulp becomes more and more firm by 
the constant loss of its watery parts, but it is even at the end of the wire cloth very 
soft and friable" *  [ibid.]. 
[XIX-1182] Ninth process. *"The marks called watermarks are now to be 
produced in the paper, if it should be intended to receive any. These marks 
consist, in fact, of a displacement of a portion of the pulp where they appear 
thinnest, by the pressure upon it while yet soft of a wire roller, upon which 
different devices are wrought. These devices are then reproduced in the substance 
of the paper, just as sealing wax receives the impress of a seal. And no matter what 
may be their variety, the soft pulp receives and retains it faithfully. This is effected 
in a very simple way. Just before the paper leaves the wire cloth, it passes under a roller 
made of brass wire, upon the surface of which the device is produced, by wires 
wrought into it, and the impress of this roller communicates itself to the paper" * 
[p. 189]. 
Tenth  process.  * "Just prior to the pulp leaving the wire web, a very ingenious 
arrangement is made in the machine, with a view more perfectly to extract the 
water. It consists of a metal box placed under the travelling web, and 
communicating with three powerful air pumps. These pumps are set in motion by 
the steam engine, and produce a powerful exhaust or vacuum in the box. The 
effect of this on the superincumbent layer of pulp is to suck in the water, and to 
cause the fibres very completely to interlace one with another. The firmness of the texture 
of the paper is thus very materially promoted" *  [ibid.]. 
Eleventh  process.  * "The paper now passes between two rollers upon a web of felt,3 
a Marx adds the German term in brackets.— Ed. 

=====第428页=====
418 Relative Surplus Value 
leaving  the web  upon which  it was  produced, which returns  for a  continual fresh 
supply. These rollers  are  covered with felt,  and  squeeze  out a  considerable quantity 
of water,  and the  paper  now  becomes pretty firm.*  But THE  WATER  has  still not 
been REMOVED entirely,  and the  PAPER  is still not  QUITE  DRY and  FIRM"  [pp.  189-90].3 
Twelfth process. *  "The  damp  but  tolerably smooth sheet  is received  by a 
large cylinder revolving  on its  axis,  but  charged with high-pressure steam.  The  heat 
thus communicated dissipates  the  moisture  as steam,  and the  paper becomes 
rapidly very nearly  dry. In  order, however,  to complete  it, it  passes over several 
other cylinders similarly heated,  and  finally emerges from  the  last of the  series  a 
beautifully white, smooth,  and  continuous sheet"  * [p. 190]. 
Parallel  or subsequent  processes. 
Glazing  the  PAPER.  * "When  the  paper  is required  to be  glazed,  it is  effected  by 
passing  it between polished  and  heated cylinders,  in passing through which  it is 
subjected  to the  most severe pressure"*  [p. 191]. 
Sizing  and  blueing  the  paper. *  "It will  be obvious that  by mixing  any  substances 
such  as gelatine, starch,  or colouring matter, with  the  pulp,  the  quality  and  colour 
of the  resulting paper  is affected accordingly.  The  finer kinds  of paper  are 
generally impregnated with gelatine  or sizeb after  the  paper  is made.* This  is done 
outside  THE VAT,  because otherwise the  FELT USED IN THE MACHINE  [is]  INJURED.  On 
the other hand, * sizing  in the vat  [offers] many advantages, when substitutes  for 
gelatine  can be  used.  Of these several kinds  are  employed.  A mixture  of alum  and 
rosin,b previously dissolved  in soda,  and  combined with potato-starch,  is now 
largely used  for  sizing  in the vat by the  continental makers. Paper thus made  is less 
greasy  to write upon,  but  does  not  bear  the ink so  well  as those which  are  sized 
with gelatine.  For  writing papers  in England  the  application  of gelatine  by an  after 
process  is still preferred,  and is  accomplished by means  of rollers  dipping  in a  trough of 
the size.  At Mr.  Joynson's mills,  in Kent, fine writing paper  is now  made, sized with 
gelatine, dried,  and cut  into sheets  at the  rate  of 60  feet  a minute  in length,  and 70 
inches  in width.  At another  of the  great paper mills  1,400  tons  of paper  are 
produced yearly.  In  Great Britain alone  130  million  lbs [of]  paper  [are] 
manufactured annually"*  [pp.  191-92].a

envelope must  be separately handled. Great economy gained  by the  machinery.  The 
isolation  of the  different stages  of manufacture consequent upon  the  employment 
of manual labour adds immensely  to the  cost  of production,  the  loss mainly arising 
from  the  mere removals from  one  process  to another.  In embossing  by hand  a boy  will 
perhaps  get  through  8,000  or 9,000  per day, and  then there must  be an  assistant  to

The "FOLDING" in hand manufacture of this kind was done 
*"by means of a bone 'folding stick', an experienced workwoman folding about 
3,000 per day.* [Now a machine] makes * about 2,700 per hour"* [p. 198]. 
The transition from handicrafts (as in all kinds of weaving, even 
when done with refined versions of the handloom) and manufac­
ture,  where the division of labour predominates, to large-scale 
industry is continuous, in that a mass of new branches of labour, 
such as NEEDLE, PEN, ENVELOPE making, etc., are first carried on for a 
short time in the handicraft fashion, then as manufactures, and 
soon after that by machine. This naturally does not exclude that 
other branches are directly introduced as machine-based—those in 
which big supplies are to be delivered from the outset (as with 
transport) or where the nature of the product requires a big 
supply (as with telegraphy, etc.). 
The casting of type (letters for printing) can be seen as an 
example of a manufacture resting on the division of labour. Five 
main operations. 
1) Casting the type. * "Each workman can create from 400 to 500 types an 
hour" * [p. 203]. 
2) Breaking off the type "(the LEAD and ANTIMONY in the METAL poison the 
LITTLE  BOYS  who have to do this),  * breaking off to a uniform length. At this 
operation a quick boy can break off from 2,000 to 3,000 types an hour, although, 
be it observed, by handling new type a workman has been known to lose his thumb 
and forefinger from the effect of the metallic poisons"  [ibid]. 
3) " The types are rubbed on a flat stone, which takes off all roughness or 'bur' 
from their sides, as well as adjusts their 'beards' and their 'shanks'.3 A good rubber 
can finish about 2,000 in an hour" [p. 204]. 
4) "The types, by men or boys, fixed into a sort of composing stick about a 
yard long, where they are made to lie in a row with their 'nicks'" all uppermost: 
3,000 or 4,000 per hour can be thus arranged"  [ibid.]. 
5) " The bottom extremities of  these  types,  which had been left rough by the second 
process, are, by the stroke of a plane,3 made smooth, and the letter ends being 
then turned uppermost, the whole line is carefully examined by a microscope; the 
faulty types are extracted; and the rest are then extricated from the stick, and left 
in a heap" *  [ibid.]. 
Thus if 1 FOUNDER casts 500 TYPES in 1 hour, and a boy breaks off 
3,000 in 1 hour, 6 FOUNDERS to ONE BOY are needed. And since 1 
RUBBER rubs 2,000 IN  AN HOUR, there are 4 FOUNDERS to 1 RUBBER, and if 
one ARRANGER sets 4,000  PER  HOUR, there are 8 FOUNDERS to 1 ARRANGER. 
With division of labour into MULTIPLES the following should be 
noted: Assume that there are 3 different operations, related in 
such proportions that 2 men must be employed in the first 
operation, and 1 man in the 2nd, to work on what the first 
a Marx adds the German term in brackets.— Ed. 

=====第430页=====
420 Relative Surplus Value 
operation has provided, whereas [XIX-1184] the 3rd operation 
requires 4 to work on the product of the 1st and 2nd operations. 
So the following numbers must be employed: operation I, 2; 
operation II, 1; operation III, 4—a total of 7. These MULTIPLES 
proceed from the principle of the division of labour, so that 
despite the different periods of time required by the various 
operations, all the workers are still employed in those operations 
simultaneously, exclusively, and for equally long periods of time. 
The less time a given operation costs for a particular quantity of 
the phase of the product provided by it, or of the particular 
function involved (e.g. stoking, repair of the machines, etc.), the 
greater must the number of other workers be to enable one 
individual to be employed in performing exclusively this function. 
If, however, I employ many founders, and therefore a 
proportionately large number of BREAKERS, RUBBERS, and ARRANGERS, 
THE PRINCIPLE OF MULTIPLES BEING GIVEN, this is the principle of simple 
cooperation. Unless the work is done on a certain scale, the 
division cannot be carried out at all. 
Many attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, 
to cast the types using a system of machinery. This will succeed 
eventually. Once a certain kind of production attains the form of 
manufacture, the constant endeavour is to transform it into 
factory production with machines. 
A [result of production] by machinery, especially where already 
existing machinery is improved or driven out by new machinery, is 
the * economisation  of space,  hence reduction of the cost of production. 
Powerloom.* 
•The original form of the powerloom very clumsy,* very similar to the old 
[handjloom. The new one very altered.a "The modern  POWERLOOM  (for weaving 
ordinary yarn)  * was only about half the size of the cumbrous original machine, and 
was made chiefly of iron, while the former was principally constructed of wood.* 
This * powerloom [is] a more complicated piece of mechanism than it appears to 
be. And this need not surprise us, when it is remembered that it fulfils all the duties 
of the weaver. It throws the shuttle, operates upon the healds, the batten and the 
beams, just as if an intelligence was communicated to it. It raises and depresses the 
alternate threads of the warp, it throws the shuttle, it drives up each thread of weft 
with the batten, it unwinds the warp off the warp-beam, and it winds up the woven 
material upon the cloth roller. But still more remarkably, this loom will not go 
without weft. On the old plan it was indifferent to the loom, so to speak, whether it 
had weft or not. Its operations were continuous, and the empty shuttle flew as 
before, but of course without making any cloth until the attendant stopped it and 
mended the thread, or placed a fresh bobbin in. But the loom of Messrs. Kenworthy 
and Bullough immediately stops under such circumstances. The moment the 
slender thread breaks, or is absent from its accustomed place, the noisy machinery

is instantly arrested, the shuttle ceases to fly and the wheels to move. The attendant 
then replaces the thread, and all goes on as before. By this ingenious contrivance 
the quality of the cloth is greatly improved, and much of the care and watchfulness 
of the weaver is rendered unnecessary, for the arrest of the machinery immediately 
informs him of the accident. This apparatus* is called *the self-acting stop*" 
[pp. 154-57]. 
"The * warp, before it is brought to the powerloom, has to be prepared by the 
unwinding of the threads off bobbins, and arranging them parallel to each other. 
In order to strengthen them, the threads of the warp have also to be sized and 
dressed with paste; both these operations [XIX-1185] are done by machinery, with 
a little assistance from the attendants" [p. 158]. 
" The shuttleless powerloom for weaving ribbons" and fringes.3 Exhibited* 1851 i.a. 
* The ordinary loom for weaving ribbons and other narrow fabrics requires, for the 
perfect play of the shuttle, a space three or 4 times greater than is occupied by the 
web.  In all looms hitherto constructed, the shuttle has been an indispensable 
necessity. To overcome this, and to economise space, invention of Messrs. Reed of 
Derby*" [pp. 162-63]. 
The machine factory. 
* "The construction of a machine to bring iron into shape must differ very 
materially from one intended to deal with the soft and delicate fibre of silk or 
cotton. A far greater exercise of force is necessary for the former class of engine. 
Without the steam-hammer, the lathe,a and the drill,3 such machines as the 
printing press, the powerloom, and the carding-engine could not have been 
constructed"* [pp. 221-22]. 
The first machinery depended on hand labour, on manufacture, 
for its construction. Once the machine had been invented, and, of 
special importance here, once a form of POWER completely at man's 
disposal and applicable in any amount, such as STEAM, had been 
discovered to set the machine in motion, the production of 
machinery by machinery became possible. On the other hand, a 
large number of working machines invented later on, such as 
those just mentioned, and also PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS,213 require 
the existence of machines for their production. The first steam 
engines were built in the mode of manufacture and handicrafts. 
Similarly the first machines which were driven by the steam 
engine, such as spinning and weaving machines, mills, etc. The 
improvement of quality by machinery—its impact on use value— 
does not concern us here as such. But its impact has a double 
importance for the production process: 1) Where a raw material 
or semi-manufacture is brought under the sway of machinery, the 
ease with which the process advances to its next phase depends in 
part upon, is conditioned by, THE  DEGREE  OF PERFECTION of the material 
it has to work with. Its homogeneity, etc., is a condition for its 
further treatment by machinery. 2) Still more important is the 
a Marx adds the German term in brackets.— Ed.

uniformity,  the  mathematical exactness  of  form,  etc.,  required 
when the elements of  MACHINES  and  PHILOSOPHICAL  INSTRUMENTS  are to be 
produced.  The  degree  of success here depends absolutely  on  this 
quality,  and the  extent  to which  the  unreliability  of handwork  is 
removed from these things,  so they  are  subjected  to the  regularity 
of the  WORKING MACHINE,  which has been precisely calculated in 
advance. 
Working machine  as  distinct from  the  other parts  of the  machinery, 
hence from the  PRIME  MOTOR  and the directing, or transmission, 
mechanism. 
* "In all  machines there  are  certain parts which actually  do the  work  for which  the 
machine  is constructed,  the mechanism serving only  to produce the proper relative motion 
of those  parts  to the  material upon which they  operate.  These working parts  are the  tools 
with which  the  machine works"  * [p. 222]. 
Here  we  have  the  correct view.  The  TOOLS  with which  the  human 
being worked reappear  in the  machinery,  but now  they  are the 
TOOLS  with which  the  machine works.  Its  mechanism brings about 
the movements  of the  TOOLS  (previously performed  by the  human 
being) required  to treat  the  material  in the  manner desired  or to 
accomplish  the  purpose desired. [XIX-1186]  It is no  longer  the 
human being,  but a  mechanism made  by  human beings, which 
HANDLES  the  TOOLS.  And the human being supervises the action, 
corrects accidental  ERRORS,  etc. 
Firstly, what appears from  the  outset  in a  machine  is that  it is a 
REUNION  of these  TOOLS,  which are set in  WORKING  MOTION  at once by the 
same mechanism, whereas  a human being could only  set in  motion 
one such  TOOL AT ONCE,  or given unusual virtuosity  at most  2, since 
he has  only  2 hands  and 2  feet.  A machine works simultaneously 
with a large number  of  TOOLS.  Thus many  100  spindles  on a 
bobbin-frame, many  100  combs  on a  carding engine, over  1,000 
needles  on a  stocking-frame, many sawblades  on a  sawing 
machine, hundreds  of knives  on a  chopping machine,  are set in 
motion  at the  same time,  etc.  Similarly  (2) the  number  of  SHUTTLES 
on the mechanical loom. This is the first  REUNION  OF INSTRUMENTS  in 
the machine.  It must, apart from this,  be from  the  outset  a REUNION 
of this  WORKING MACHINERY  with  the  mechanism which sets  it in 
motion and with the  PRIME MOTOR,  which  MOVES  the  MECHANISM.  Second 
REUNION:  arises from  the  fact that  the  different machines through 
which  the raw  material  has to  pass  in the  succession  of processes 
are connected with each other,  and are  driven  by the  same motive 
power. There  is thus  CONTINUITY  of the  production process  and 
system,  i.e. a  combination  of the  processes carried  out by  different 
machines  in the  different phases. Third  REUNION.  A number  of

WORKING MACHINES of this kind are driven by the same motive power, 
with the corresponding PREPARATORY MACHINES for the earlier phases, 
united in a workshop. The principle of simple cooperation is 
applied to the machines and the workers employed on them. This 
is one of the most important aspects of developed machine 
production. Firstly because of the saving on the  PRIME MOTOR  and the 
economical distribution of the  MOVING  POWER.  Secondly the smaller the 
scale of production, the more costly the PREPARATORY PROCESSES,  partly 
because of the cost of the machinery  itself;  partly because the 
number of workers required for the work falls in proportion to 
the increase in the size of the operation, and the intermediary work, 
e.g. the transfer of the product from one process to another, is 
reduced, where it is done by workers, in inverse proportion to the 
scale on which the work is done. Thirdly. Just as in simple 
cooperation, the costs of the collectively used conditions of labour 
such as buildings, fuel, heating, OVERLOOKERS, etc., fall in proportion 
as the scale of production rises. There is, further, in addition the 
principle which arises out of the division of labour that [the tasks 
of the] MANAGER, the mechanic, the ENGINEER, the stoker, etc., can in 
part be handed over to workers who are exclusively concerned 
with them, in part are just as necessary on a large scale as they are 
on a small scale. Finally (leaving aside the utilisation of waste 
products) the simultaneous exploitation of many workers is only 
possible in this way, and the amount of surplus value realised by 
the individual capital depends on this, if its rate is given. 
Secondly. Or instead of the reunion of many TOOLS in a machine, 
many TOOLS appear to be combined together from the point of 
view of their power, their dimensions and their sphere of action, 
in the way that many hammers appear to be combined in a 
STEAM-HAMMER. Here, where the TOOL of machinery is distinguished 
from the TOOL of the worker by its dimensions, a mechanical 
driving force is required from the outset. This kind of machinery 
can therefore never exist in the handicraft manner, i.e. in such a 
way that it can be driven by a single worker or his family, or a pair 
of journeymen with a master craftsman. 
With the above, there is now an answer to the question of what 
distinguishes a machine from a tool. Once the tool is itself driven 
by a mechanism, once the tool of the worker, his implement, of 
which the efficiency depends on his own skill, and which needs his 
labour as an intermediary in the WORKING  PROCESS,  is converted into 
the tool of a mechanism, the machine has replaced the tool. In this 
case the mechanism must already have attained a degree of 
development which makes it capable of receiving its motive power 
28*

424 Relative Surplus Value 
from a mechanically driven PRIME MOTOR, instead of receiving it as 
before from a human being or an animal, in short from PRIME 
MOTORS which possess voluntary movement. 
[XIX-1187] As long as the latter is still the case, the machine 
only appears as a machine-like handicraft tool. In proportion as its 
dimensions grow and it develops into a system of production, 
mechanical must replace human motive power. 
In its first form, however, the machine (which at the same time 
throws out of work a mass of workers employed in handicrafts 
and manufacture, since it allows one person to perform what 
would otherwise be performed by 10 or 20) annihilates the system 
of manufacture and simple cooperation based on the division of 
labour, and appears to replace it once again with a system of 
handicrafts. 
Simple cooperation is doubly annihilated, in that one weaver 
now does what was done by many weavers assembled in a 
manufactory; and on a larger scale e.g. with mowing and 
threshing machines, building machines for raising heavy weights, 
machines for breaking stones, etc. But secondly, in that 
everywhere that power needed to be produced by simple 
cooperation, the mechanical motive power replaces this. 
But this does not rule out 1) that machine factories may be built 
straight away as such, without passing through the previous stages; 
2) that in work where the EXERCISE  OF FORCE predominates from the 
outset the motive power must also be mechanical from the outset, 
i.e. with no relation to human or animal muscle power. 
If the machine proceeds from simple handicrafts, e.g. if machine 
weaving replaces hand weaving, a machine must perform simul­
taneously the various operations performed previously by the 
handicraftsman. This does not appear as a system of processes 
accomplished by the REUNION of different machines. At most, that 
is, in weaving, the preparation of the  WARP  as a preparatory 
process. This is now also mechanical. On the other hand, in 
spinning, e.g., preparatory processes which are simple in hand 
spinning are separated into a series of processes. 
Or the machine proceeds from a system of manufacture based on the 
division of labour, and then either a complex single machine 
replaces the separate operations, as with the production of 
envelopes,  STEEL PENS,  etc., or the previously separated operations 
are replaced by a series of processes carried out by a system of 
machinery, as with the spinning of wool, etc., and also, particularly 
as an example, papermaking. 
The explanation that a MACHINE is  A COMPLICATED TOOL and  A TOOL  A 

=====第435页=====
Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 425 
SIMPLE MACHINE explains nothing. The explanation that you have a 
machine where the tool is not driven by human power, and a tool 
where man is the PRIME MOVER, would make a dog-cart or a plough 
drawn by oxen a machine, but a mechanical stocking loom or a 
bobbinet machine, etc., a tool. It contains no element from which 
the social CHANGE can be explained. It runs counter to the history of 
the development of machinery in general, and to the history which 
the first HANDICRAFTS and MANUFACTURES are still passing through daily 
in their transition to the machine-based factory. It depends 
altogether on the state of affairs in which the essential nature of 
machinery was not yet so far developed that the APPLICATION of the 
PRIME MOVER was a matter of free choice, according to the level at 
which the machine is to operate. 
The system of mechanical production can go further, and unite 
branches of production previously independent of each other, as 
e.g. in the FACTORIES where spinning and weaving are united, and 
form a continuous system. 
In the year 1861 (see Parliamentary Return: Factories, 11 Feb­
ruary 1862a) there were altogether 2,715 FACTORIES in England and 
Wales (not including Scotland and Ireland), [XIX-1188] of which 
671 were EMPLOYED IN SPINNING AND WEAVING. There were in these 
factories 13,274,346 spindles, 235,268 POWERLOOMS and 215,577 
persons employed [Factories..., p. 3]. (Included among these 
persons are *all managers, clerks, overlookers, engineers, 
mechanics, and all other employed in the factory, except the 
owners or occupiers constituting the firm* [p. 1].) 
If one reflects that the total number of spindles used at the 
same time in all the English COTTON  FACTORIES=28,352,125,  the total 
number of POWERLOOMS=368,125, and the total number of persons 
employed=407,598, one sees what an overwhelming position is 
occupied by spinning and weaving combined. Those 671 factories 
employed 143,947 STEAM HORSEPOWER, and 3,823 WATER HORSEPOWER. 
The number of POWERLOOM WEAVERS came to 99,504. 
The number of boys under 13 years old was 11,289, the number 
of girls under 13 years old was 9,224, making children under 13 
together=20,513. Women and girls over 13=115,117. Thus 
children  (FEMALE  AND  MALE  UNDER  13) and women=  135,630.  Hence the 
number of men employed (all the clerks employed in the offices, 
those employed in the WAREHOUSE, etc., ENGINEERS, MECHANICS) =  79,947. 
The number of  MALES  between 13 and 18=19,699. If one deducts

this group, which still includes  a large proportion  of children,  the 
number  of  MALES  over  18  years  old  comes  to 60,248,  of which  at 
least 4,000  are not  employed  in  FACTORY  labour. There thus remain 
56,248 employed  MALES  over  18  years  old. 
To the  total number  of  English  COTTON FACTORIES,  2,715, with 
28,352,125  SPINDLES,  368,125  POWERLOOMS  (149,539  POWERLOOM WEAVERS), 
263,136  STEAM  [horse]power  and  9,825  WATER  [horse]powER, there 
correspond 407,598 persons. Within this number there  are  39,156 
children under  13  years  old.  NUMBER  OF  FEMALES ABOVE  13  YEARS: 
216,512. Thus children under  13,  girls over  13 and  women 
together come  to 255,668 people.  Men  between  13 and  18:  38,210. 
Together 293,878. There remain 113,720  men  over  18,  from 
which figure  at  least 15,000 must  be  deducted  for  those  not 
employed  in the  factory  itself.  There remain  ABOUT  98,000  [p. 3]. 
FACTORIES  occupied  in  SPINNING  alone number  1,079.  Number  of 
spindles: 15,077,299.  POWER:  99,976  STEAM  and  4,883  WATER.  Number 
of persons employed: 115,192  [ibid.]. 
Factories occupied  in  weaving alone number  722.  POWERLOOMS 
131,554.  POWER:  15,240  STEAM  and 406  WATER;  number  of persons 
employed 63,160. 
(The total number  of 2,715  FACTORIES  includes  243  factories 
which are  NOT  INCLUDED  IN EITHER  OF  THE ABOVE DESCRIPTIONS  [pp. 2-3].) 
We will  now  look  at the  WOOLLEN,  etc.,  FACTORIES  in England  and 
Wales. (Same Return  for  1861 [pp.  4-5].)  [See  Table  1 on p.  429.] 
TOTAL  OF  WOOLLEN FACTORIES  (including,  in addition  to the  above, 
129  FACTORIES EMPLOYED  IN FINISHING  AND  DRESSING,  and 120  NONDESCRIPT 
factories):  1,456,  with  1,846,850  SPINDLES,  20,344  POWERLOOMS,  2,066 
GIGS,  25,233  STEAM,  6,675  WATER,  and  76,309 persons employed. 
If we  analyse this number,  5,931  should  be  deducted, being 
children under  13  years  old  (3,333  MALES  and  2,598  FEMALES). 
Moreover, 29,613  FEMALES  over  13  (among whom there  are in  turn 
many children) [should also  be  deducted]. With  the  above, this 
makes 35,544.  MALES BETWEEN  13 and 18,  again including many 
children, account  for a  further  9,811.  There remain 30,954  MALES 
ABOVE  18. Of  whom  AT  LEAST  7,000 need  to be  deducted. There 
remain 23,954  MALES  [p. 5]. [See  Table  2 on p.  429.] 
But it will  now be  better  to  make  up a  list for all  kinds  of 
production alongside each other,  in order  to display  the  relation 
of the  combined factories  to the  others. From this  one  can  see the 
concentration which takes place  as a  result  of this combination.  To 
ease comprehension  it should  be  remarked that  the  excess  of the 
total number  of factories over  the  number indicated under specific

[Continued from  p. 426] 
headings arises from  the  inclusion  in the  total  of  FINISHING  and 
DRESSING FACTORIES  or factories engaged  in other special tasks which 
do not  fall under  one of the  general categories.  The  list only 
covers  England  and  Wales (1861).  HOSIERY FACTORIES  and  LACE 
MANUFACTURES  are not  included here.  [See  tables  on pp.  430-33.] 
First  of all,  then: 
I) COTTON.  The  number  of combined factories  is 671  here.  The 
number  of  spinning alone  is 1,079,  of weaving alone  is 722,  and 
1,079+722=1,801, hence  the  proportion  of the  first type  is almost 
Vs already.  The  combined factories alone employ 215,577 persons; 
the two  other types together employ 115,192  + 63,160=178,352. 
Hence, although they amount  to less than  7s of the  others,  the 
combined factories employ 37,225 more persons. 
Furthermore, there  are  ON THE  AVERAGE  for 1  combined factory 
19,782 spindles  (and  624/67i);  350 and  4I8/67]  POWERLOOMS;  and 220 
(and 150/67i)  POWER.  For 1  WEAVER  there  are 2 and  36,26%9,504  POWER-
LOOMS.  The  number  of spinners  is not  indicated; they  are  instead 
lumped together with persons employed  in the  OFFICES, WAREHOUSES 
and otherwise.  But we  shall  see  this when dealing with  the  children. 
[XIX-1192] 215 For 1  combined factory there  are:  spindles, 19,782; 
POWERLOOMS,  350;  POWER,  220;  proportion  of  weavers  to  POWERLOOMS,  1 to 
236'26%9,504,  WEAVERS  per  factory over  148.  Number  of  persons  per 
factory: over  321. 
The  AVERAGE  for 1  SPINNING  factory,  in  contrast,  is:  number  of 
spindles, 13,973;  POWER,  97;  number  of  persons  per  factory,  106; 
proportion  of  persons  to spindles,  1 person  to  ABOUT  130  spindles. 
AVERAGE  for 1  WEAVING  factory:  POWERLOOMS,  182;  POWER,  22; proportion 
of POWER  to persons,  [457  /is,646]-
According  to the  proportion which exists  in the  SPINNING  only 
COTTON MILL,  group  I a)  (SPINNING AND WEAVING)  would have  to employ 
102,110 persons  for its  13,274,346 spindles.  For  weaving, accord­
ing to the  proportion  in the  WEAVING  only  CONCERNS  I c),  [group  I a)] 
would have  to employ 88,115 persons  for its  235,268  POWERLOOMS. 
Thus somewhat more than 190,225 persons altogether.  But it 
employs 215,577. 
In the  case  of I c)  there  is 1  weaver  for  2.67  POWERLOOMS.  In the 
case of I a) 1  weaver  for  2.36.  Thus fewer weavers  are  needed  in 
case I c), the  weaving only factories, than  in I a)  (TO  A SMALL 
FRACTION). 
In I b) the  following relationship holds between  the  number  of 
spindles  and the  POWER:  143.7  SPINDLES  to 1  POWER.  In I c)  there  are ... 
8.4 POWERLOOMS  to 1  POWER. 

=====第445页=====
Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 435 
According to the proportion found in I b), I a) ought to employ 
a POWER of 92,375.4 for its SPINDLES. And according to the 
proportion in I c) it ought to employ 28,008 for its LOOMS. But it 
employs much more power than this. 
In example I there is no saving in workers or  POWER  to be seen, 
nor is there any relative increase in the number of SPINDLES and 
LOOMS.  Admittedly, to make a complete comparison one ought in all 
3 CASES to have the product of I. 
[XIX-1193] In the case of I b), the total of 115,192 persons 
includes 14,873 children under 13, 13,003  MALES  BETWEEN  13 and 18, 
and 54,851 FEMALES ABOVE 13. There appear to be somewhat more 
children and women employed altogether in the case of the 
combined factories I a). We now want to turn to the other 
category, where there is perhaps SOMETHING ELSE to see. With I we 
only see that there is a growth in concentration; the AVERAGE 
combined factory sets in motion more POWER, more SPINDLES, more 
LOOMS and more PEOPLE than the non-combined factories I b) and 
Ic). 
Let us apply ourselves to table II) WOOLLEN FACTORIES? 
Here the concentration is much more significant than under I, 
in COTTON, which is due to the fact that spinning and weaving mills 
are not so large as COTTON manufacturing ones. 
The number of combined FACTORIES is 440, that of non-combined 
factories is 763. The proportion of combined to non-combined is 
1:1.7,  more than a  half.  II a) employs 26,542 more PEOPLE than 
II b) and II c), which employ together only 20,308: hence it 
employs more than twice the number. It employs 325,854 more 
SPINDLES, 18,210 more LOOMS, and 523 more GIGS; furthermore, it 
employs 5,781 more POWER. 
There are for 1 factory (on the AVERAGE): 
SPINDLES  LOOMS  GIGS POWER PEOPLE 
II a) 2,468.9 43.8 1.8 38.8 106.4 
II b)  1,043.2  0.3 15 25.9 
II c) 31.3 0.7 8.6 41.4 
The ratio between PEOPLE and POWER cannot of course be seen 
from these figures, since the AVERAGE does not apply to any 
particular factory. 
According to the proportions in II b), II a) would have to 
employ  POWER  of 35.5 for  spindles.  (We are  leaving  the  GIGS  out of 
a Here Marx repeats the corresponding table, given on p. 430 of this volume. He 
omits the line containing the totals.— Ed.

consideration  in all 3  CASES.)  It also needs  a further  12 for its  LOOMS, 
hence  47.5  altogether.  But it  only employs  a POWER  of 38.8,  8.6  less. 
There  is therefore  a saving,  a more economical  or more intensive 
employment  of  POWER.  In II b)  there  is 1  person  for  every  40.2 
spindles,  or for  760,498 spindles+258  GIGS=760,756  there  are 
18,899  PEOPLE.  Thus 40.2. In II c) there are  PEOPLE  TO THE  AMOUNT  OF 
1,409  for 1,067  LOOMS  and 26  GIGS=  1,093.  II a), on the  other hand, 
employs 20,084  POWERLOOMS  and  GIGS.  This  is 18.3  times more.  If the 
proportion  in II b)  were followed,  II a)  would have  to employ 
27,023  PEOPLE  for its  SPINDLES;  and if the  proportion  of II c)  were 
followed  for its  LOOMS  and  GIGS  it would have  to employ somewhat 
over 25,784; taken together this  is 52,807.  But it  only employs 
46,850, thus  5,957  less. There  is therefore  a saving  in workers 
relative to [XIX-1194] the  MASS  OF WORKING MACHINERY  PUT IN  MOTION. 
Out of its  total  of 18,899  PEOPLE,  II b)  employs  1,184  MALES  and 
705 [females] under  13  years old=  1,889,  hence  Vio  plus  a fraction

If we now  pass  to II a) we  find 15,009 weavers  to 19,277  LOOMS. 
Hence  1 weaver  to 1.2  POWERLOOMS.  3,728 children under  13.  Divided 
into 46,850, this  is 12.5, not  quite  V12;  10/i25=2/25- 4,799 youths

more  MALES. 
The number  of children under  13 and  youths between  13 and 
18 has  fallen  in  comparison with  II b).  This  is to be  explained 
from  the  introduction  of machinery which makes  the  children  in 
part superfluous, as we can see from the  FACTORY INSPECTORS' REPORTS; 
an arrangement which originates from  the  fact that  the  MANUFACTU­
RERS  found it vexing to have  TO  EMPLOY  TWO  SETS  OF SO-CALLED HALF-TIMES. 
But the  number  of  FEMALES  over  13  years  old has  grown almost 
from  Vs to  V2, and  thus  the  overall ratio  of women  to men has  also 
grown,  in  comparison with  II b). If,  however,  we  make  a 
comparison with  II c), it is  difficult  to determine  the  ratio, since  in 
a The  exact figure  is 1.62.  Marx  put 1.6,  then changed  it to 1.7, and  used  the 
latter  in the  subsequent calculations.—  Ed.

calculations.—  Ed.

weaving the female element predominates still more over the male 
here. 
Let us now pass to III) WORSTED  FACTORIES? 
The number of combined factories is 125, that of the others is 
363, hence less than '/s; but the number of PEOPLE employed in the 
combined factories is larger by 12,112: 21,254 more SPINDLES are 
employed, 8,660 more POWERLOOMS, and 1,900 more POWER. 
There are for 1 AVERAGE factory:

We shall leave aside the fractions, even though this makes the 
calculation merely approximate. 
Ill b): 28(3/io6) spindles to 1 worker. Ill c):  1 26/ss POWERLOOMS to 
1 worker. 
There appears to be no SAVING OF LABOUR in this case. 
[XIX-1196] VII) SILK  FACTORIES* 
Large-scale industrial production of silk is relatively new in 
England (compared with wool and cotton, similarly with flax in 
Scotland, Ireland, etc.), the number of factories in this branch is 
therefore relatively large, and their size in contrast is RELATIVELY 
SMALL. Hence here the combined factories also constitute a less 
significant proportion than in the other cases.c 
The number of combined factories is 49, that of the others is 
666; hence the former are  ABOUT  2/27 of the total number; but the 
number of spindles employed by these 2/27 is almost V4 of those 
employed by the 244 spinning factories, and the number of  LOOMS 
EMPLOYED by them is over Vs of those employed by the 422 weaving 
factories, etc. The more precise ratio emerges from the following 
calculation:

The ratio between  POWER,  PEOPLE,  and quantity of machinery, as it 
appears  in these averages,  is absolutely imaginary; they  are  only 
intended  to  demonstrate concentration.  On the  other hand, 
however,  we  once again  see  here  the  undeniable  FACT  //and  here  it 
is still more significant than before// that there  is ECONOMY OF POWER 
in the  combined factories,  in certain  BRANCHES.

handicraft tools. This is the characteristic feature of the old 
weaving manufacture and the further preparation of cloth. Almost 
no division of labour at all here. At most for certain auxiliary 
operations, some of them preparatory, some FINISHING. The main 
economy here is: the communal use of the general conditions of 
labour, such as the building, heating, etc. The overall supervision 
of the manufacturer, hence the element which is peculiar to 
capitalist production in general. 
Ure says in Philosophie des manufactures, Vol. II (pp. 83-84) a: 
"It deserves to be remarked, moreover, that handworking is more or less 
discontinuous from the caprice of the operative, and therefore never gives an 
average weekly or annual product at all comparable to that of a like machine equably 
driven by power. For this reason hand-weavers very seldom turn off in a week much 
more than one-half of what their loom could produce if kept continuously in action 
for 12 or 14 hours a day, at the rate which the weaver in his working paroxysms 
impels it"b [A. Ure, The Philosophy of Manufactures..., London, 1835, p. 333]. 
The mechanical workshop of course enjoys this advantage as 
much over the system of manufacture as it does over the system of 
handicrafts. In the mechanical workshop the motion and speed of 
the machine  (PRIME  MOTOR)  rules over human labour, in manufacture 
and handicrafts the reverse is the case. But it also applies to 
manufacture in contrast to handicrafts, to a lesser degree. In the 
latter, the handicraftsman is  MORE  OR LESS a human being who works; 
in the former he is a worker who as such and qua worker belongs 
to someone else, who solicits his aid merely in his quality as a 
machine for working. 
[XIX-1199] 2) The unification into a single factory of crafts divided 
into many independent branches. The division is present in advance 
here,  but every part of the work is carried on as an independent 
handicraft. The first thing that happens now is the annihilation of 
this isolation and independence. The difference is summed up in 
the fact that the particular form of labour no longer produces the 
product as a particular commodity, but merely as an integral part of 
a commodity. The separate product ceases to be a commodity as 
such. Once this unification of what was previously divided has 
taken place, SUBDIVISION develops further on the basis of this 
spontaneously evolved manufacture, which found its components 
already divided and  SELF  ACTING. TO this combination of previously 
dispersed handicrafts, found in manufacture, there corresponds, 
within large-scale industry, the combination of factories, one of 
a Marx presumably quotes from the Paris edition of 1836.— Ed. 
b Marx quotes in French.— Ed.

which produces a semi-manufactured object, while the other uses 
it as its raw material. This is how it is with spinning and weaving. 
The prerequisite for this was that both branches had already been 
separately brought under the system of machine production. 
Just as one should not think of sudden changes and sharply 
delineated periods in considering the succession of the different 
geological formations, so also in the case of the creation of the 
different economic formations of society. In the womb of the 
handicrafts, manufacture develops in its initial stages and even 
machinery is employed here and there, in individual spheres and 
for individual processes. The latter point is even truer for the 
actual period of manufacture, in which water and wind (or even 
human and animal power as mere remplaçants a for water and 
wind) are employed for individual processes. But these are isolated 
cases and do not constitute the character of the ruling period, do 
not form its pivot, as Fourier says. b The greatest inventions— 
gunpowder, the compass, printing—belong to the handicraft 
period, as also does the clock, one of the most remarkable 
automata; just as the most brilliant and revolutionary discoveries 
in astronomy, those of Copernicus and Kepler, belong to a time 
when all mechanical aids to observation were in their infancy. 
Similarly, the construction of the spinning machine and the steam 
engine rested on the handicrafts and manufacture which built 
them; they also rested on the science of mechanics, developed 
within this period, etc. 
But the general law which is valid throughout, is that the 
material possibility of the later form is created in the earlier form; 
both the technological conditions and the economic structure of 
the workshop which corresponds to them. Machine labour is 
directly called into existence as a revolutionising element by the 
excess of needs over the possibility of satisfying them with the old 
means of production. But this excess of demand is itself given by 
the discoveries made still on the handicraft basis, by the colonial 
system founded under the domination of manufacture, and by the 
world market relatively firmly established by the colonial system.** 
Once the revolution in the productive forces has been achieved— 
which is displayed in technological terms—a revolution also starts 
in the relations of production.

correspondingly, produced either  in the  handicraft manner  or on 
the basis  of the  division  of labour applied  in manufacture.  As soon 
as machine production becomes dominant,  its means  of produc­
tion—the machinery  and  tools employed  by it—must themselves 
be produced  by machines. 
[XIX-1200] Except where animals  can be  employed purely 
mechanically,  as with turning  a mill, their employment  is entirely 
dependent  on  their voluntary movement,  and the  direction  of 
their will  by the  human will,  a principle which  has  nothing  in 
common with machine production. Moreover, they  can  only  be 
employed  as  POWER  in manufacture  TO A  VERY SMALL DEGREE, because 
their employment  on a  mass scale would take  up  tremendous 
space. 
Mr. John  C. Morton,  AT THE  SOCIETY  OF ARTS  (January 1860), read  a 
paper  on the  FORCES  USED  IN AGRICULTURE,217  dealing particularly with 
the displacement of  HORSEPOWER  by STEAMPOWER,  and referring to the 
advantages  of machinery, where animal  (as  also human) power  is 
displaced  by  mechanical power, which  is cheaper,  and can act 
more uniformly over  a greater period  of time: 
* "The forces referred  to are ...  steam power, horsepower,  and  manual labour... 
Purely mechanical power, supplied  by the  steam engine,  may be  more extensively used 
with every improvement  of the  land which tends  to give uniformity  to its 
condition... Force derived from horses,  required where crooked hedge-rows,  and  other 
obstacles, prevent uniform action,  and  which constantly diminishes...  In operations 
requiring more exercise  of the  will,  but  less actual power,  the only competent force  is 
that directed from moment  to moment  by the  human mind—manual labour..." 
Mr. Morton reduces these forces  to 
"'horsepower'"  (as  used  in reference  to steam engines),  "i.e. the  unity assumed 
as equal  to pull  or lift 33,000 lbs one foot  per minute.  By calculations given,  the  cost 
of steam power  is estimated  at 3d. per  hour, while  the  cost of horse labour  is 5'^ri­
per horsepower  per  hour,  and the  steam power  can be  continued  for  much more 
lengthened periods than  the  horse labour.  So  that  the  force supplied  by steam 
'horsepower'  at 3d. per  hour,  is nearly twice  as great  as that supplied  by actual 
horsepower"  * //since  the  horse  can  only  be employed  for 8  hours  in this manner!// 
* "at 5'/2cl.  per  hour.  And  where steam power  can be  used,  the  quality  of the  work 
performed  by its  aid"  * //on  account  of its  uniformity  of motion// *  "is superior  to 
that done  by horsepower. This applies  to threshing,3 chaff-cutting,b grinding  and 
[the] like"  * (similarly sowing, mowing) *  "and  seems equally applicable  to 
steam-ploughing...  By  comparing  the  mere force  of manual labour with  the two 
other forces,  it is  found that  to do the  work  of the  steam engine  66 men  would  be 
required  at 15s. per  hour,  and to do the  work  of the  horsepower  32 men  would  be 
required  at 8s. per  hour. Competition  of manual labour  as a  force, with steam  or

translation  of the  word  "chaff".—  Ed.

horsepower,  is therefore obviously  out of the  question...  By  steam power  at least  3 
out of every  7 horses  on arable land  may be  dispensed with  all the  year,  at a  cost 
not exceeding  the  cost  of these horses during  the 3 or 4  months, when alone they 
are really needed  on the  land."* 
One may see  from  the  above firstly  in a  sphere where  STEAM 
POWER,  HORSEPOWER  and  MANUAL LABOUR COMPETE  IN AGRICULTURE—THEIR RELA­
TIVE  VALUES,  AS TO  POWER  AND  ECONOMY;  2) that a plough is not a 
machine. Leaving aside  the  older form  of the  plough, where  the 
farmer does more work behind  the  plough than  the  horse  or the 
ox in front  of the  plough,  the  employment  of  STEAM  presupposes 
UNIFORMITY  of the  SOIL,  just  as a  locomotive presupposes rails instead 
of a road. These conditions  are  part  and  parcel  of the  [XIX-1201] 
employment of the machine, i.e.  A WORKING  MECHANISM  ABLE  TO RECEIVE  ITS 
MOVING  FORCE FROM  A MERELY MECHANICAL FORCE. 
The development  of the  mechanical workshop into  a system  is 
straight away made necessary  in spinning  by the  fact that  the raw 
material in  ITS  PREPARATORY PHASES  MUST  BE MECHANICALLY PREPARED,  IN ORDER 
TO BE ABLE  TO BE WORKED  UPON  BY MACHINERY.  And these  PREPARATORY PROCESSES 
for their part require relatively much more  ASSISTANCE OF MANUAL 
LABOUR,  IF CARRIED  ON ON A  SMALL SCALE, INSTEAD OF  A LARGE ONE.  The system 
therefore requires  for its  part once again  the  combination  or 
cooperation OF A  GREAT  LOT OF  WORKING MACHINES WHICH  ARE FED  BY THE 
PREPARATORY  PROCESSES. 
Nothing could  be  more incorrect than  to conceive  the  medieval 
system  of corporations  and  guilds,  in which  the  division  of labour 
amongst particular  HANDICRAFTS  forms  at once  the  basis  of a  social 
and political organisation,  as something "unfree".  It was the  form 
in which labour emancipated itself from landed property,  and 
definitely  the  period  in which labour stood  at its  highest point, 
socially  and  politically.  In  order  to understand  its  real character, 
one must study German history  in particular, since  in Germany, 
unlike France, royal power  did not  conspire with  the  emerging 
burgher estate against  the  feudal elements.  One  would then find 
that the  system  of corporations  and  guilds, constantly suffering 
setbacks  in the  struggle against imperial  and  feudal power, 
constantly reasserts itself afresh against  it. Only when  the  material 
basis—the technological basis  of organisation—had ceased  to be 
dominant, when  it had  therefore lost  its  revolutionary  and 
ASCENDING  CHARACTER,  when it had ceased to be appropriate to the 
epoch  and  entered into conflict, partly with manufacture, partly, 
later  on,  with large-scale industry,  did it  start  to be  protected,  as a 
reactionary element,  by  reactionary governments  and the  estates  in 
alliance with them.

As soon  as we are to be  able  not  only  to extend  the  dimensions 
of machines  at will,  but  also  to develop them into  a system  of 
machinery,  a driving force—and  PRIME  MOVER—applicable  at any 
level must  be available. Hence  no development  of machinery  was 
possible without  STEAM.  The  STEAM ENGINE  was  IN FACT  invented before 
the industrial revolution. Imperfect.  Now  along with  its  INDUSTRIAL 
NECESSITY  its form  is also discovered.  The  elements  of the  machine 
were present before Watt gave  it the  form industrially applicable 
to manufacture. 
[XIX-1202] "Steam engine:  a machine which  is able  to bring about  a mechanical 
effect through  the  action  of water steam.  The  first idea  for  this [was put  forward] 
in the  second half  of the 17th  century.  To bring about movement  by using steam  it 
was necessary  not  only  to produce  the  steam pressure  but to  remove  it afterwards 
and to be  able  to condense  the  steam. 
"Papin invented  the  safety valve  in 1680;  later  he also arrived  at the  idea  of 
making  the  steam  act in a  cylinder  on a  kind  of piston.  He covered  the  base  of the 
cylinder with  a layer  of water, converted  it into steam  by placing  the  cylinder over 
heat,  and  thus drove  the  piston  to the top. By  taking away  the  heat,  or removing 
the cylinder from  the  heat,  he effected  a condensation  of the  steam,  so that  the 
atmospheric pressure acted  on the  piston  of the  cylinder, which  was  open above, 
thereby forcing  it down. Papin published experiments  of this nature  in 1690 in the 
Acta Lipsiensia?18 
" Savery,  an English captain, came upon  the  same idea  at ABOUT  THE  SAME TIME, 
and had  already actually constructed several machines when  in 1696 he  published 
a description  of them.  The  principle  of Savery's machine differed from that  of. 
Papin's  in that  he did not use a  piston  to transmit  the  effect  of the  steam,  and he

was also able  to accomplish  the  condensation  of the steam much more conveniently 
and more quickly.  His  achievement  was the  building  of the  first large-scale steam 
engine. Savery later made  use of  Papin's safety valve. Savery's machine  was 
employed  in raising water.  It consumed  an extraordinary quantity  of fuel,  and was 
difficult  to construct  in very large dimensions. Water could  not be  raised very  far 
with it. Much effort  was put  into finding  an improvement,  in particular  in trying  to 
apply  to it  Papin's first ideas  of a  piston-driven machine.  It was 2  Englishmen  who 
first succeeded completely  in this endeavour, 
" Thomas Newcomen, blacksmith,  and 
"John Cawley, glazier,  and  they should  be considered  the  first  to introduce  the 
piston-driven steam engine. Since Savery, thanks  to his  patent, possessed  the  sole 
right  to create  a vacuum  by the  condensation  of steam, Newcomen  and  Cawley 
entered into association with  him, by  taking  out a  patent  in 1705, in the  names  of 
all 3, 'to  condense steam directed under  the  piston,  and to  bring about  an 
alternating movement through  its connection with  a lever'.  The  construction  of this 
'atmospheric' machine, later named after Newcomen alone,  not  only offered  the 
advantage that,  if one  wanted  to raise water with  it, the  steam  did not  come into 
contact with  the  water  at all, but  also that  it provided  at the  same time  the  possibility 
of bringing about  any  kind  of  movement"  [A. Ure,  Technisches Wörterbuch..., 
pp. 423-26]. 219 
This application of  MECHANICAL POWER  took place where, as with 
wind and water mills in manufacture,  GREAT EXERTION  OF  FORCE  was 
necessary  (stamping,  turning,  raising)  and  where  in fact human 
labour acted as an automatic  PRIME MOTOR  creating its own power, 
whereas  the  implement  of labour  was  manipulated  not  with  the 
hand  but was  directly connected with  the  transmission  mechanism, 
the shaft,  crank,  etc. 
"Newcomen later improved  the  machine  by changing  the  method  of obtaining 
condensation:  the  cold water, instead  of being poured onto  the  outside  of the 
cylinder,  was  sprayed into  it. 
"The taps  and the  steam distributor initially  had to be  operated  by hand, until  a 
boy called Humphry Potter,  who was  employed  to attend  a Newcomen engine,  had 
the idea  of connecting  the  handles  of the  taps  and  distributors  to the  beam (with 
strings)  and  letting  the  machine operate them  itself. 
[XIX-1203]  "The  Newcomen engine  was  still  far  from perfect,  a particular 
disadvantage being  the  condensation  of water  in the  cylinder  of the  engine, which 
resulted  in a  considerable loss  of heat; while  the  cylinder itself never became 
completely cool.  All  attempts  to remedy this basic deficiency were fruitless,  and the 
construction  of the  steam engine remained  the  same  for nearly  70 years. Then Watt 
came onto  the  scene. 
" Watt's first engine  was one in  which  the  steam produced only  the  downstroke  of the 
piston,  i.e. a  single action engine.  The  upstroke  was  produced, once  the  piston  had 
reached  the  bottom  of the  cylinder,  by closing  the  steam inlet  and  letting  the  steam 
previously introduced flow over  and  under  the  piston,  the  pressure  on the two 
sides thus being neutralised.  A counterweight attached  at the  other  end of the 
beam, together with  the  pumping rods installed there  for  raising  the  water, could 
therefore easily effect  the  ascent  of the  piston... Useful  as the  single action Watt 
engine still  is for  raising water  and  salt-springs,  it is  well-nigh useless  for 
accomplishing  any  other mechanical work" [ibid.,  pp. 426-28,  430].

Thus the first single action Watt engine was in fact only an 
improved version of the steam engine, not as a GENERAL  PRIME  MOTOR, 
but in the original special function it had in the epoch of 
manufacture, that of a machine for pumping water. 
"Most industrial applications make it necessary to convert the linear motion of a 
piston into rotary motion; with the single action engine this is admittedly possible, 
but if the motion produced is to be highly uniform, this can only be achieved if an 
inert object of tremendous weight (a flywheel) is set in rotary movement. But the 
engine has to waste a tremendous amount of power to move such an object; this 
power could otherwise have been employed usefully, not to mention the resulting 
increase in wear and tear on pivots and bearings. 
"These circumstances led Watt to invent the double action steam engine. In this 
case the steam produces both the upstroke and the downstroke of the piston, the 
counterweight becomes entirely unnecessary, and the flywheel, which has to be 
attached to ensure uniform motion, can be much lighter. In 1782 Watt took out a 
patent for the double action engine, and from this time onwards the steam engine 
emerges as useful for all branches of industry. 
"Improvements subsequent to Watt in the double action steam engine for the most 
part concerned subsidiary matters. In particular, it was sought to construct the 
engine in such a way that it took up as little space as  possible.  It was for this reason in 
particular that attempts were made to get rid of the beam, and connect the radius 
bar of the crank directly with the piston rod... Engines which operate purely 
through expansion, without condensation, air and cold-water pumps, are Woolf 
engines" [pp. 430, 432, 435-36, 441]. 
A steam engine therefore requires the following elements: 
1) A boiler, with its appliances for firing, stoking, etc. 
[XIX-1204] 2) A steam  cylinder,  with piston, piston-rod and stuffing 
box. 
3) A regulating appliance (valve), both on the inside and the 
outside, 
and 
4) in condensation engines—a condenser, with an air and water 
pump. 
The steam engine as a product of the period of manufacture. 
Here not as a  GENERAL  PRIME  MOTOR but only for a particular purpose, 
the raising of water. Moreover, not originally automatic, since the 
opening and closing of the taps, partly to introduce water into the 
boiler, partly to cool down the cylinder and condense the steam, as 
also the opening and closing of the steam distributor at the end of 
the pipe connecting the boiler to the cylinder (the end facing the 
boiler),  was originally done by hand. Nor was it an engine worked 
purely by steam, but rather an engine in which atmospheric pressure 
was essential. (The cylinder was above; Watt was first to make it 
enclosed. In his first engine, however, there was still a counter­
weight, attached to the other end of the beam, the one facing the 
pump, which actually produced the upstroke through its weight) 

=====第458页=====

Atmospheric pressure  was  essential  because,  after  the  steam  was 
condensed through  the  spraying  of cold water  on the  cylinder,  a 
semi-vacuum arose  inside.  Watt's first engine  was  itself merely  an 
improved version  of the  steam engines used  for  raising water  in 
the period  of manufacture.  Only with  his 2nd  engine,  the  double 
action engine, was he able to transform it into a  GENERAL  PRIME  MOTOR 
for industry  as a  whole. 
Railways. 
Here  too the  beginning belongs  to the  period  of manufacture. 
"The oldest rails were made  of wood,  and  rails  of this type  are  said  to have 
been  in use  already  200  years  ago in  quarries  and  mines  in England  and  Germany. 
The discovery that  a horse could pull more than  4 times  as much  on rails  as on 
ordinary roads  led in 1738 to the  construction  of the  first line with cast iron rails 
for the  general purposes  of transport.  The  first railways used nothing  but  horses  for 
transport.  The  first idea  of employing steam engines  to move vehicles  on wheels 
came from  Dr.  Robinson  of Glasgow  in 1759. In 1761  Watt pursued  the  idea,  and 
after  him in 1786 the  brilliant Oliver Evans  in North America.  But it was  only  in 
1802 that  the  Englishmen Trevithick  and  Vivian constructed  the  first steam 
locomotive, which  was  able  to pull  a load  oi 10  tons along  a railway line  at a  speed of 
5 English miles  per  hour.  All  kinds  of experiments.  A theoretical prejudice that  the 
friction  of the  wheels  on a  smooth rail would  not be  sufficient  to prevent  a mere 
sliding  of the  wheels, their rotation  on the  spot, making  it impossible  to pull heavy 
loads.  In 1814  Stephenson constructed  the  first genuinely serviceable steam 
locomotive  for the  Stockton  and  Darlington Railway. These locomotives were only 
for transporting freight.  In October  1829  Stephenson's locomotive  won the  prize  at a 
competition  on the  Liverpool  and  Manchester Railway. Condition:  it had to  pull  a 
weight  3 times  its own at a  speed  of 10  English miles  an hour.  In 1839, on the 
same line,  the  13-ton locomotive  St.  George pulled  a load  of 135  1I2 tons  at an 
average speed  of 214 /s English miles  per  hour" [ibid.,  pp. 545,  567-69]. 
"1851  GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY  COMPANY:  such  ENGINES  have been  CON­
STRUCTED  for it  since 1847.  It pulls  *a passenger train  of 120  tons,  at [an]  average 
speed  of 60  miles  per  hour.  The  evaporation  of the  boiler, when  in full work,  is 
equal  to 1,000  horsepower,  of 33,000  lbs per  horse—the effective power,  as 
measured  by a  dynamometer,*  is * equal  to 743  horsepower.  The  weight  of the 
engine [XIX-1205] empty  is 31  tons; coke  and  water,  4 tons—engine  in working 
order,  35 tons. 
"Long after  the  extended  use of the  steam engine  by the  miner,  the 
manufacturer,  and the  navigator,  it was  still  to be  applied  to the  purposes  of 
locomotion  on  land"*  [The  Industry  of Nations, Part  II, pp. 83, 86, 88]. 
The first steamboat, produced  by  Fulton  (and  Livingstone),  was The  Clermont,

SUBSTITUTED  FOR WOOD  IN RAILROADS"  (this  was  written  in 1846)...  * "Railroads were 
only considered  fit for  heavy goods, [such]  as coal, iron,  or stone.  The  locomotive 
engine,  for  drawing carriages  on railroads,  was  not  thought  of,*  though Watt, *  in 
his patent, describes  a scheme  for  which  he formed  a steam carriage,  but he never 
carried  it into practice. Murdoch,  his  pupil,  an  engineer, when connected with 
Boulton  and  Watt,*  was  the  first * who actually constructed  a steam carriage  in this

these parts  of machines require manual labour trained  up for  this kind  of work 
exclusively"*  [The  Industry  of Nations, Part  II, pp.  222-23]. 
"Among  CONSTRUCTING ENGINES  there  is *  Nasmyth's steam hammer, [which  is] 
capable  of smiting  a block  of granite into powder,  and as  capable  of breaking  a 
nutshell without injury  to the  kernel. Patent  for it  taken*  [out in] 1842.  Used  in 
LARGE ENGINEERING ESTABLISHMENTS,  some  of which have  3-4 of  these hammers,  of 
30, 15, 5 CWT., etc.,  FOR  DIFFERENT  KINDS OF  WORK;  the  * steam hammer requires for 
itself  the  attendance  of one  person only.  The  most gigantic machine  of the  kind  at 
Messrs. Mare's large works: hammer  of 6  tons weight, with  a stroke  of 6  feet.* This 
GREAT HAMMER  is called  ' Thor'. Forges  * a paddle wheel shaft  for a  pair  of marine 
engines  of 16 V2 tons,  27 feet 9 inches  in length.* With  the  *aid  of a  powerful 
crane, 3 the  welding3  and  forging  of this large mass  is rendered  as simple  and  easy 
as that  of a  horseshoe  in the  hands  of a  country smith.*  In the  EXHIBITION  of 1851 
there  was a  hammer  of this kind, with  an  ANVIL  weighing  8 * tons;  the  hammer 
itself [weighs] 1  1/i tons,  [and is]  suspended from  the  piston rod a;  the  piston, which 
works  in the  cylinder, placed  at the top of the  machine,  [is] 16  inches  [in]  diameter, 
and the  extreme fall  of the hammer  (in steam engines called  [the]  stroke)  is equal  to 
42 inches;  the  pressure  of steam usually employed being equal  to 40 lb. on the 
square inch.  The  hammer being  on the  self-acting principle, every degree  of blow, 
from that  of merely cracking  an eggshell  to that  of a  dead pressure  of 500  tons,  is 
attainable.  By admitting  the  steam under  the  piston,  the  hammer  is elevated  to the 
desired height,  and by its own  gravity  the  hammer falls;  but the  fall may be 
instantly eased,  if desirable,  by the  admission  of steam, according  to the  particular 
kind of blow required.  In ordinary works,  as many  as 70  blows  are  given  in a 
minute.* Used  in *  iron shipbuilding establishments, anchormakers, large engine builders, 
and at the  principal railway manufacturing establishments;  the  making  up of  iron, 
either from scraps,  old  rails, hoops,3  or from  the  pile is also effected  by means  of 
this hammer" [ibid.,  pp. 223-26]. b 
[XIX-1207] "Before  the  introduction  of this adjunct  to the  smithy,  the  forging 
of large marine engine shafts  was not  only  a tedious,  but an  uncertain process;  and 
many  an accident which  has  occurred  to the  ocean steamers  to be  traced  to the 
imperfect forging  of iron;  for,  without blows  of sufficient energy,  it is  impossible  to 
expel  the  scoria3 from between  the  bundles  of iron rods, which,  as in the  United 
States, they attempted  to weld together  to form their main shafts" *  [p. 226]. 
"Apart from this * formidable kind  of work, [they  are]  employed  in the 
stamping  out of  dish covers,  and the  moulding  and  forming  of silver plate.*  In his 
patent  of 1784,  TAKEN  OUT  in April, Watt already  has in  mind this kind  of 
application  for the  * steam engine.  He alludes  to a  probable mode  of applying  the 
piston-rod  of a  steam engine,  in connexion with  a heavy hammer  or stamper,  for 
forging iron  and  other metals*"  [p.  227]. b 
This is the  greatness  of Watt, that  in a  patent TAKEN OUT  in April 
1784  he foresees  all possible applications  for the  STEAM ENGINE,  and 
puts them forward  as possibilities,  for locomotion,  for the  forging 
of metals,  etc.

*"A still more powerful hammer  for  some ironworks  at Dowlais. Hammer  of 
6 tons weight,  [a] clear fall  of 7  feet perpendicular, anvil  36 tons  in one  solid mass. 
Under such control  as to be  made  to drive  a nail into soft wood, with  a succession 
of most delicate taps. This monster hammer employed  for  giving some  6 or 8 
tremendous blows  to the  masses  of iron called 'blooms', from which  the  railway 
bars are  rolled,  so as to  weld them into  one  solid mass before they  are  drawn  out. 
This invention also invented  for  driving piles3"  [pp.  227-28]. 
"Ordinarily  the  instrument used  for  forging  is what  is called  a tilt-hammer. 
Heavy mass  of metal, weighing  3 to 4  tons,  the  head  of which  is placed upon  the 
anvil, which  is sunk  in the  ground, while  the  shanka rests upon pivots,  in a  strong 
frame.  In order  to lift this hammer,  a large wheel  is arranged near  the  head, upon 
the circumference  of which projecting pieces  or cogs3  are  placed.  As  this wheel 
revolves,  the  cogs catch  one  after another under  the  head  of the  hammer, lift  it up 
a certain distance,  and  then release  it, when  it falls  on the  object placed  on the 
anvil.  Its force  is merely that acquired  by its own  weight,  to which  is superadded 
the impetus  of its  fall. But the  height  to which such  a hammer  can be  raised  is very 
limited,  and in  real power  it is far  inferior  to Nasmyth's hammer.  The  moving 
power  of the  tilt hammer  may be  steam, applied through  the  medium  of pulleys 
and shafting,  or  water power from  a waterwheel, used  in the  same  way"

machine  is smaller  and  more complicated.  It has a  HIGH VELOCITY  together with  a 
POWERFUL STROKE  (on a  MUCH  SMALLER  SCALE  than the above)" [pp. 229-31]. b 
"RIVETING  MACHINERY.0  IN BOTH"  (this  and the  previous * machine) "iron  in the 
heated state  is the  material commonly operated upon.  The  forging engine reduces 
the metal into form,  and  moulds  it at the  will of the  worker;  the  riveting engine 
[XIX-1208] simply crushes  up a  red-hot bolt,  and so  clasps  two  iron plates 
inseparably together. 
"The first application  of machinery  to riveting iron plates  was  introduced  by 
Mr. Fairbairn  of Manchester.*  He  himself says: *'The invention  of the  riveting 
machine originated  in a  turn-out  of the  boilermakers  in the  employ  of this firm 
about  15  years  ago. On  that occasion  the  attempt  was  made  to rivet  two  plates 
together  by compressing  the  red-hot rivets  in the  ordinary punching-press.  The 
success  of this experiment immediately  led to the  construction  of the  original 
machine,  in which  the  movable  die was  forced upon  the  rivet  by a  powerful lever, 
acted upon  by a cam. A  short experience proved  the  original machine inadequate 
to the  numerous requirements  of the  boilermakers' trade,  and the  present form 
was therefore adopted about  8 years since.' This machine  is in a  portable form,  and 
can be moved  on rails.* Through this machine  12 times  the  QUANTITY  is DONE  IN 
THE SAME TIME  and  * one man's labour saved.  The  riveting  is done without noise" 
[pp. 231-34]. 
"It may be  safely stated that  but for  this machine  the  construction  of the 
tubular" iron bridges would have been almost impracticable.  The  invention  of this 
machine, like that  of several others used  in manufactures,  as the  result  of a 
'turn-out'  on the  part  of the  operatives, only gives additional testimony  to the  folly

of such proceedings.  The  object  of introducing  the  rivets into these holes while 
red-hot  (the  tubes  of the  great bridges)  is to  secure  the  subsequent powerful 
contraction  of the  metal  in cooling  by which  the  plates  are  bound together with  the 
most powerful force"  * [p. 234]. 
This is a very pretty line of reasoning about  STRIKES.  Machinery is 
favourable to the workers when the manufacturer introduces it 
without their participation, but unfavourable when  PUSHED  ON BY 
THEM.  On the other hand, it is precisely as a result of the  TURN-OUTS 
that such significant machines as the  SELFACTOR,  or Fairbairn's 
RIVETING  MACHINE (without which TUBULAR IRON BRIDGES  are  ALMOST 
IMPRACTICABLE),  etc., have been introduced. So this is good, the more 
so because the introduction of machinery is in general good for 
the worker. But when  STRIKES  are in question, machinery is 
presented as bad for the worker. He should not accelerate his fate. 
"Another stationary  RIVETING MACHINE  of *Mr.  Garforth  at Manchester puts  in 
360 rivets  per  hour, with  the  attendance  of 1 man and 3  boys.  In this engine  the 
force  for  driving  up the  rivet  is entirely obtained from  the  thrust  of a  piston-rod, 
impelled forward  by  high-pressure steam" *  [pp.  234-35].a 
"PUNCHING  MACHINE*  for  PERFORATING.  The one in  »Woolwich Dockyard  [is] 
quite self-acting.  The  pressure necessary  to penetrate  an iron plate  .08 of an  inch 
in thickness  by a  punch half  an  inch  in  diameter, requires  a power  of 
6,025 pounds,  and  through  one of .24  inch  in thickness  it demands  a force  of 
17,100 pounds"  [pp.  236-37]. 
"The shearing engine  is generally connected with  the  punching engine,  and is 
placed  at the  opposite side  to the  punch,  or above  it, as may be  most convenient. 
The shearing portion  is a  flat bar of  steel, brought  to a  cutting edge,  and  acting 
against  a similar edge  on the bed of the  recess, somewhat like  a pair of scissors.  It is 
a wonderful spectacle  to enter  one of the  large machine-shops  at Manchester,  and to 
behold  a row of these  monster engines  at work.  To hear  the  clanging  of the  metal  as hole 
after hole  is made  in it; to see it cut  like  a sheet  of paper,  and  shaped into  its 
required figure;  and to  feel  the  solid ground trembling under  the  effects  of these 
cyclopean instruments...  The  punching  and the  shearing engine  are to the  machine-maker 
what  the  scissor  is to the  tailor,  and the  auger0 [XIX-1209]  to the  carpenter. They  are 
the rudimentary constructing instruments,  and are  among  the  most indispensable 
furniture  of the  iron factory"  * [p. 237]. 
These,  therefore, are the  PRINCIPAL CYCLOPEAN CONSTRUCTING INSTRUMENTS. 
Leaving aside this enormous  POWER,  machine construction makes 
necessary the greatest mathematical precision of the individual 
parts and the production of these en masse, involving the 
employment of  WORKING MACHINERY  on a large scale.

* Application of self-acting machinery to the construction of more 
refined machines.* 
* "The almost mathematical accuracy and precision with which the forms of the 
various details, whether of the most delicate, of most ponderous machines are 
executed, is highly deserving of notice. To produce pieces of machinery so perfect by 
manual dexterity and labour" * (and the clock?) * "were hardly possible; and if 
possible, would entail so great an expense, that neither in quantity nor price could 
we by any increase of machinery and skilled population have kept pace with the 
demand which has followed upon the increased perfection and facilities of production 
realised by improved mechanism. 
"Only 60 years ago, nearly every part of a machine had to be made and 
finished to its required form by mere manual labour; i.e. we were entirely dependent 
on the dexterity of the hand and the correctness of the eye of the workman, for 
accuracy and precision in the execution of the parts of machinery. With the 
advances of the mechanical processes of manufacture invented by Watt, Arkwright, 
Crompton, Brunei, Didot and Jacquard, a sudden demand for machinery of unwonted 
accuracy arose, while the number of skilled workmen then existing were neither 
sufficiently numerous nor skilful to meet the wants of the times. Mr. Henry 
Maudslay, about 40 years ago" (about* 1810 or 1814) *"introduced the slide 
principle into the tools and machines employed in the production of machinery; 
and, but for the introduction of this principle, we never could have attained to the 
advanced stage in machine-making in which we now are (the slide 3). 
"The principle here alluded to is embodied in a mechanical contrivance which 
has been substituted for the human hand for holding, applying and 
directing the motion of a cutting-tool to the surface of the work to be cut, by which we are 
enabled to constrain the edge of the tool to move along or across the surface of the object, 
with such absolute precision, that with almost no expenditure of muscular exertion, 
a workman is enabled to produce any of the elementary geometrical forms—lines, 
planes, circles, cylinders, cones and spheres—with a degree of ease, accuracy, and 
rapidity, that no amount of experience could have imparted to the hand of the 
most expert workman. The slide principle is embodied in the slide-rest, now become 
a part of every lathe, and applied in a modified form in the boring mill, the 
planing machine, the slotting engine, the drilling machine, etc. Simple and 
outwardly unimportant as this appendage to lathes may appear, it is not, we 
believe, averring too much to state, that its influence in improving and extending the 
use of machinery has been as great as that produced by Watt's improvements of the 
steam engine  itself.  Its introduction went at once to perfect all machinery, to cheapen 
it, and to stimulate invention and improvement. Soon after its introduction the 
slide-rest was made self-acting, that is, its motion along or across the surface to which 
the tool it held was applied were rendered independent of the attention of the 
workman in charge of it" * [pp. 238-39]. 
The  SLIDE-REST  therefore represents the human hand in general. 
* "Boring engine, by which the cylinders of steam engines, hydraulic presses, etc., 
are cut out and smoothed on the inside. In these machines, the cylinder to be 
bored is firmly secured upon a frame prepared to receive it, and the cutting 
instruments are gradually advanced by a screw into its interior; the cutting tools 
revolve as they enter, and remove portions of the metal gradually until the whole 
cylinder is bored. In the best arrangements of these machines the [XIX-1210]

advance  of the  boring tool  is entirely automatic.  The  boring machine  may be in 
general terms described  as a  contrivance  for working  a bore  or tool, which, by  a rotary 
motion  on its  axis, cuts  out a  hollow cylinder  in any  substance  it is  applied  to. 
"The cylinders  of steam engines  and  those  of hydraulic presses require  to be 
bored with extreme accuracy  and  care, since  any  inequality  in the  diameter  of the 
cylinder would certainly cause great leakage when  a high pressure  was  applied  to the 
piston working  in it. It is  only  by the aid of  this engine that  our  prime movers  are 
obtained;  for it may be  safely stated, that  the  manufacture  of a  steam engine  of any 
working dimensions could  not be  accomplished without  the  assistance  of the  boring 
engine.  It is  also applied  for  other machines, such  as pumps,  etc." [pp.  239-41]. 
The lathe.* 
"Scarcely  any  part  of a  machine exists  to which  the use of the  lathe  has not 
been  in some  way or  other necessary.  It is an  instrument  of universal value"  * 
[p. 241]. b 
"The  CONSTRUCTION  of the  SIMPLE FOOT-LATHE  is essentially also that of a 
machine driven  by steam. *The only part absent  is the  axle  and the  flywheel,  for 
this part  is not  here necessary, since  the  rotary motion  is communicated from  a 
shaft  by means  of a  band,  and  this shaft  is actuated  by the  steam engine.  In heavy 
works, however,  and  indeed  in all  power lathes  of any  value,  the  self-acting principle 
is introduced,  and  adjustments  are  made  to accomplish that object.  The use of the 
lathe  in manufacturing work  is necessarily confined,  as a  general rule,  to the 
production  of cylindrical bodies,  or for  giving  a round form  to particular parts  of 
machines"  [pp.  241-43]. 
Shaping machine (slotting engine). (Much more modern introduc­
tion than  the  lathe.) 
"The principle  on which  ' this engine works  is simply that  of a  vertical chisel,* 
moving  up and  down,  and  cutting through  the  metal  as it  descends.  By an 
ingenious arrangement  of cogs  the bed is  capable  of being moved  in concert with 
the rest  of the  machine,  and  thus continually presents  a fresh surface  for the  tool 
to act against.  It is a  most interesting sight  to observe these iron workmen chiselling 
their obdurate work into shape, without  any  sort  of human assistance.  It will be 
easily understood that  any  machine capable  of cutting down  in a  vertical direction 
can be applied  for  giving  a definite form  to a  block  of metal.  Any  angular figure 
can be produced  by this engine under  the  control  of the  workman,  in whose hands 
it becomes,  in fact,  a powerful knife, cutting  out  just as he  sees  fit" [pp.  244-45].b 
"Planing machine."  An iron carpenter,  for all  that  the  latter effects upon wood 
with his planes,  the  machine accomplishes by means  of its tools,  Precision  and  Power.  By 
it the  most accurate plane surfaces  may be  produced,  for the  machine  is incapable 
of giving  out  incorrect work,  and  these surfaces  are,  consequently,  far superior  to 
those obtained formerly  by the  file of the  skilful workman.  In the  best work done 
by hand, some slight deviation from absolute rectilinear motion  is always 
observable.  It differs from  the  shaping machine  in this, that  the  work  is cut by 
being carried against  a stationary cutting tool.  The  tool,  it is  true,  is capable  of lateral 
and vertical movements,  but  this is merely  so as to  present  to it a  fresh part  of the 
work,  as*  [XIX-1211]  in the  »sliding rest*  of the  *lathe.  The  object intended  to be 
planed,  is firmly secured  to the bed of the  machine,  and  this being capable  of a

to-and-fro motion,  is set  going.  A cutting tool  is arranged  in a  strong frame across 
the length  of the  engine,  and the  carrying forward  of the bed of the  machine with 
the work  on it,  brings  the  latter  in contact with  the  tool, which planes,  or rather 
ploughs along  its surface, scraping  up a  shaving  of iron  as the  work passes beneath 
it" [pp.  245-47].

"The machinery used  for  wood-work  is not  less ingenious.  It is  chiefly  of American 
origin.  In that country machinery  for  working  in wood  is even more largely 
employed than with  us, and  these machines find their  way  into workshops  of a 
smaller character. Much greater value  of manual labour  in that country  ... as  little 
work  as possible  is done  by hand  ... more attention paid  to economy  of time  and 
labour,  and to  production  of rapid results with  the  least possible expenditure, than 
to great durability  and  finish. [Where] natural obstacles  [are] to be  contended with

cases  a series  of  scoop "-wheels.* They somewhat resemble  the  undershot 
waterwheel;  but  instead  of being turned  by the  impulse  of the  water * they  [are 
used  to]  lift it, and are  moved  by steam power.  The  quantity discharged  by the

Washing  and  drying machine  [p. 266]. 
* "For various purposes  in the  arts  a current  of air in  rapid motion  is required.* 
E.g. *the whole series  of foundry operations, steel-grinding, lace-gassing, warp-
drying,  etc. In all  these procedures  a blast  of air is  absolutely needed. 
"The common bellows  is constructed upon very faulty principles,  and is of  course 
wholly unfit  for the  wants  of the  manufacturer.  One of its  chief defects lies  in the 
interruption  of its  action,  by reason  of which  it is not  capable  of giving  out a  regular 
and continuous stream  of air. To  effect this  a new  adjustment  of its  parts  is 
necessary.  The  nozzle* must communicate with  a second chamber,  in which  the air 
can accumulate under pressure,  and the  pumping part  of the  bellows,  its lower 
part, must throw  the air  into  the  reservoir,  and not, as in the  common bellows, 
directly through  the  nozzle. 
"The smith's bellows  is a  better machine. Here there  is a  reservoir  for the air; and 
the current  is continuous  and not  intermittent.  By connecting  the arm  acting  on the 
blacksmith's bellows with  the  cranka  of a  steam engine  or waterwheel  a power  air 
pump  of a  simple kind  is formed  ; and  this sort  of machine  is often employed where  a 
better  one  cannot  be procured.  The  volume  of air, however, which  it is  capable  of 
giving  out is  very small,  and  cannot  be made  to receive  any  high degree  of velocity. 
The pressure, however,  up to  which  the  reservoir  can be  loaded  by weights  is an 
advantage, since  a small  but  very powerful  jet of air can  thus  be procured. 
"Air machines  can, in  fact,  be  arranged under  the  same head  as hydraulic 
machines. Some  are  constructed upon  the  pumping principle,  and  others  on the 
centrifugal. Bellows belong  to the  class  of pumping machines.  For  small forges,  as 
in machine shops  for the  smaller parts  of machines,  an improved kind  of smith's 
bellows  is constructed. Enfer's apparatus  a great improvement upon  the  black­
smith's bellows. 
"As it is  found  in hydraulics that  a pump  is the  only engine which  can be 
satisfactorily used  for  driving  out  water  at a  high pressure,  and  that centrifugal 
engines  are  only  fit for low  lifts and  large quantities;  so in  this case,  the  centrifugal 
air engine  is little adapted  to the  wants  of the  forge, where  a compact and powerful  blast 
is needed more than  a broad current  of air" *  [pp.  272-74].

seasoning solution,  the  whole  is then hermetically secured,  and the  air is  exhausted 
by the air  pump driven  by a  steam engine.  A vacuum having thus been obtained, 
and the air  removed from the cells  of the wood,  air is readmitted into  the  chamber,  and

Corn  mills. 
* "It is found that  the  great friction  and  pressure necessary  to reduce corn  to 
powder heats  it so  much  as to  render  it very liable  to undergo decomposition,  and 
the only method  of preventing this  is by  introducing  a current  of air  between  the 
stones,  and  thus keeping  the  flour cool. 
"One  of the  most magnificent flour mills  in the  Royal Dock-yard  at Plymouth. 
The building  is 240  feet long,  and 70  feet in height.  In the centre  2 steam engines 
of 45 horsepower,  on each side  12 pairs  of stones, each performing  123  revolutions 
in a minute,  and  grinding  5 bushels  of corn  per  hour,  so that when  the  mill is in 
full work,  120  bushels  of corn  are  ground  in that time,  and  the  flour  is dressed  by 
8 machines.  The  corn  is laid on the  upper floor,  and  then  is conducted  by spouts, 
first to  screening machines,  or  cylindrical sieves, arranged somewhat like  an 
Archimedean screw.  It is  admitted  at one end,  and  being cleaned  of sand  and  dust 
in its  passage, falls into  a hopper,3 from which  it passes  by  spouts  to the  mill 
stones.*  Then  it is  * purified  of bran.  The  machines usually employed consist  of a 
kind of cylinder made  of wirecloth.  The  flour  is passed into this,  and is  brushed 
through  the  meshes  of the cloth  by brushes.  The  flour  is sometimes driven through 
the meshes  of the cloth  by fans, [which  are]  made  to revolve very rapidly,  and  thus 
blow it through.  The  wirecloth  [is]  extremely fine  in its  texture.  [At the] 1851 
(Exhibition) [there were] specimens  * with 22,500 * holes  in a  square inch.  A length 
of more than 3,900 feet  did not  exceed  one  ounce  in weight"  [pp.  278-79].b 
"Philosophical instruments:  at first  of the  rudest  and  simplest construction.  The 
insensitiveness  of a  chemist's balance,  the  defective construction  of a  lens,  the 
incorrect graduation  of a  thermometer,  or the  faulty subdivision  of the  circle  of a 
transit instrument, vitiate  all  researches  in  which they  are  employed.*  The 
ACCURACY  of the  PHILOSOPHICAL  INSTRUMENTS  is therefore  OF THE  HIGHEST  VALUE 
for SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE.  Conversely, the  STEAM ENGINE  and the [electric] telegraph" 
(clocks too for the most part) "are  INVENTIONS ORIGINATING ENTIRELY  IN  PHYSICAL

"The iron  is rendered magnetic  by transmitting  the  voltaic electricity through

"Professor Oersted first discovered that  a magnetic needle placed within  the 
influence  of a  current  of electricity  circulating through  a coil of wire,  has  immediately 
a tendency  to  deflect,  or turn aside, communicated  to it. In  this consists  the

FEMALES  ABOUT  10/i6=5/8  of the  total,  and  MALES=3/8.  The  number  of 
males  is smaller  if 5 are  deducted  per  each  of the  6,378 factories 
to account  for  MALES  not  actually  in the  factories. 31,890 males 
should therefore  be deducted,  say  30,000. 
[XIX-1218]  The  number  of children under  13 comes  to 69,593, 
nearly  '/n of the  total.  The  total number  of children cannot  be 
given, since with  the  males  all those between  13 and 18 are 
lumped together, with  the  FEMALES  all those over  13. 
The number  of MALES over  18 only comes  to 201,636,  of whom 
over 31,000 must  be deducted;  say  31,000. There remain 170,636. 
If we take  the  number  as given  in the  statistics,  the  proportion 
of males over  18=ABOUT  5/i9,  less than  V3. 
If we  take  the  number after deduction  of the  31,000,  the 
number  of males over 18=ABOUT  the  4.5th part,  or less than  1/4. 
There  are  230,564 WEAVERS  to 490,866 LOOMS. Approximately 
2.1 LOOMS tO 1 WEAVER. 
The proportion  of  SPINDLES  to workers  is more difficult  to 
calculate. Firstly  we  must deduct  the  workers employed  on the 
LOOMS.  Secondly those employed outside  the  factory,  and  those  not 
engaged  in direct factory labour. Thus  the  ENGINEERS, stokers, 
MECHANICS,  etc.,  must also  be reckoned here.  And  there  are at  least 
8 to be  deducted  per  AVERAGE factory. Removing  the  weavers leaves 
544,970.  And  removing  8 per  factory over 6,378 factories leaves 
493,874.  But now  there  are the  additional difficulties  1) that  we 
do not  know  how  many  are  otherwise employed  in the  weaving 
industry;  and 2)  that  the  GIGS (only  in the  WOOLLEN  INDUSTRY)  are not 
separately listed. 
But the  total number  of GIGS  is only 2,163. They  can  therefore

be left  out of  account.  But we  find approximately 113,308 persons 
in the  categories covering factories where weaving alone  is done 
(first  a further deduction  of  4,487  has to be  made  for  HOSIERY; 
there remain 489,378).  Of  these only 81,049  are  WEAVERS,  more 
than  l3/io  of a  person  to 1  weaver; approximatelya 
But we  have given  the  number  of  spindles  per  person 
elsewhere.0 
[Horse]powER altogether  is 404,633. After deducting those  not 
employed  in the  factory this  is almost  2 [horse]powER  to 1  person. 
But these numbers must only  be  used  for the sex and age  ratios, 
since what needed  to be  said  on the  other points  has  been said 
elsewhere.

It should be remarked that in 1835 over 2/s of the children still 
worked  FULL TIME  (17,147 worked only 8  HOURS AND ATTENDED SCHOOL). 
Since 1838 children have only worked  HALF TIME,  and in the  SILK 
INDUSTRY  children between the ages of 8 and 11 (not between 11 
and 13) have worked  HALF TIME  and  ATTENDED SCHOOL.

In looking at the increase in the number of workers employed in 
the FACTORIES  the following distinctions must always be made: this 
occurs either a) as a result of the spread of an established 
machine industry (e.g. the  COTTON SPINNING FACTORY);  or b) through 
subsumption under machine production of spheres previously 
subordinated to handicraft production (particularly where one 
kind of production, e.g.  COTTON SPINNING  or WEAVING,  is taken over by 

=====第477页=====
Division  of Labour  and Mechanical Workshop  467 
machinery, and machinery is then gradually applied to every kind 
of spinning and weaving); or lastly c) through incorporating into 
the factory certain branches of a machine-based industry which 
previously stood outside the  FACTORY  and were carried on in 
handicraft fashion. Thus the Reports of the Inspectors of Factories for 
31 October 1856 remarks as follows in relation to the above tables 3 
(the data for 1861 of course missing): 
[XIX-1224] *"The increase  of  cotton looms"* (since  1838)  * "has been 
consequent upon  the  extension  of trade,  not  from power having been applied  to any 
special article formerly woven solely  by hand"  * (this  is therefore  an example  of a), 
above);  * "but  in the  other fabrics  it will be found that power  is now  applied  to the 
carpet loom,  the  ribbon loom,  and to the  linen loom,  in which  its application  had 
hitherto been very much restricted.  In these three fabrics, intricate  and  carefully 
conceived alterations were  necessary  to adapt the looms to steam power" * (I.e.,  p. 16). (The 
latter process  is an  example  of b).) 
* "The application  of power  to the  process  of combing wool  ... extensively  in 
operation since  the  introduction  of the  'combing machine', especially 'Lister's'  ... 
undoubtedly  had the  effect  of throwing  a very large number  of men out of  work. 
Wool  was  formerly combed  by hand, most frequently  in the cottage  of the comber.  It is 
now very generally combed  in the factory,  and  hand labour  is superseded, except  in 
some particular kinds  of work,  in which hand-combed wool  is still preferred. Many 
of the  hand combers found employment  in factories,  but the  produce  of the  hand 
comber bears  so small  a proportion  to that of the machine, that  the  employment  of a  very 
large number  of combers  has  passed away" (I.e.,  [p.] 16). 
" The  increased employment  of men in  worsted factories  is doubtless owing  in some 
measure  to the  process  of 'combing wool' being  now  very generally performed  in 
the factories since  the  introduction  of combing machines"  * (this  is thus  an 
example  of c)); *  "and  the  large proportion  of men  employed  in woollen factories 
arises from  the  heaviness  of the  material,  and  consequently  of the  work,  in dressing 
and finishing factories" (I.e.,  [pp.]  19-20). 
"It will  be seen,"*  the  same Report says, *"that  the  number  of children  has 
decreased since  1835  very considerably  in woollen  and  flax factories, while  it has 
gradually increased  in worsted factories.  The  decrease  in the  former  is to be 
attributed  to the  introduction  of machinery,  now  rapidly increasing,  whereby  the labour of 
children  is entirely  superseded."  * (This  was a  consequence  of the  TEN  HOURS' BILL.) 
* "The greater number  of children  now  employed  in worsted factories  is not a 
consequence  of an  increased demand  for  juvenile labour,  but of the  immense 
development  of the  worsted manufacture during  the  last twenty years...  The  largest 
proportion  of  children  is employed  in  worsted factories—being double  the 
proportion  of cotton factories—the smallest proportion  in flax factories"  * (I.e., 
[p.] 19). 
Since  SILK  and  WORSTED FACTORIES  are the only ones in which we 
find on comparing 1856 and 1861 an absolute (and not merely 
relative) decline in the number of persons employed, it is  WORTH 
WHILE  looking at these  FACTS  more closely. 
But first the following should be quoted on the spread of

machinery, or  RATHER  of powER-driven machinery, from the above 
Report. 
* "The adaptation  of power  to machinery heretofore moved  by hand  is almost  of daily 
occurrence  ... the  minor improvements  in machinery having  for their object  the  economy 
of power,  the production  of better work,  the  turning  off more work  in the same time,  or 
in supplying  the  place  of a  child,  a female,  or a man, are  [XIX-1225] constant,  and 
though sometimes apparently  of no  great moment, have somewhat important 
results" (I.e.,  1856, 31st  October,  p. 15).* 
In the  same place  it says: 
* "There  has  been  no mechanical invention  of recent years which  has  created  so 
great  a revulsion  in the  mode  of. manufacture,  and  eventually  in the  habits  of the 
operatives,  as the  spinning jenny  and  throstle frame  did"*  (I.e.,  [p.] 15). 
Here  the  correct sequence  of events  is correctly  expressed.  The 
"MECHANICAL INVENTION"  first. Thereby there was  CREATED  a "REVULSION 
IN THE  MODE OF MANUFACTVRE  " (mode of production) and  HENCE  in the 
relations of production,  HENCE  the  SOCIAL RELATIONS  and  "EVENTUALLY" 
in the  "HABITS OF THE  OPERATIVES". 
* "The application  of power  to the  loom  is the  cause  of the  greatest diversion  of 
labour from  an old  channel  to which recent public attention  has  been drawn.  The 
sufferings  of the  handloom weavers were  the  subject  of an  inquiry  by a  Royal 
Commission,  but  although their distress  was  acknowledged  and  lamented,  the 
amelioration  of their condition  was  left, and  probably necessarily  so, to the  chances 
and changes  of time, which  it may now be  hoped have nearly obliterated those 
miseries,  and not  improbably  by the  present great extension  of the  powerloom.  It has 
never been possible  to ascertain  the  number  of handlooms,  but an  estimate  has 
been given that  the  number  of handloom weavers  and  their families consisted  of 
about 800,000 persons  in 1838. At  that date steam power  was  employed almost 
exclusively  for  cotton looms,  or for  fabrics mixed with cotton,  but  immediately 
afterwards there  was a  rapid increase  in the  number  of powerlooms  for all  fabrics, 
woollen, worsted, flax,  and  silk,  and  their increase  has  continued  to the  present 
time"*  (I.e.,  [p.] 15). 
The same Reports  for 1856, 31st  October,  has the  following  to say 
about  the  growth  of factories  (I am  adding  the  data  for  1856-61): 
* "The average increase  of factories from  1838 to  1850"*  (12  years)  * "was  at 
the rate  of 32 per  annum, while from  1850 to 1856 it has  been  at the  rate  of 86 
per annum"*  (and  from 1856-61 I/excluding  the  newly added  HEMP  and  IUTE 
FACTORIES,  as well  as the  "mechanical"  HOSIERY  FACTORIES//  230 per  annum).  * "In 
the former period" (1838-50)  "the  increase  was  confined  to factories engaged  in 
the manufacture  of  cotton, woollen,  and  worsted,  and the  increase  was in the 
following proportions:  in cotton factories  6%;  woollen factories  13%;  worsted factories 
20%.  In the  period between 1850  and  1856,  the  principal increase  has  been  in cotton 
and silk factories.  The  aggregate increase  is, in  cotton factories 14.2%; woollen 
5%; worsted  4.7;  flax 6.1;  silk 66.0%"* (I.e.,  [p.] 12). 
[XIX-1226]  The  INCREASE  for the  period between  1856 and 1861 
is: COTTON  by 13%,  WOOLLEN  11%,  WORSTED  1%.  FLAX:  reduction by 
5%.  SILK:  increase  by 67%.

What  is interesting, therefore,  is that  1) in  FLAX  the  number  of 
factories declined between  1856 and 1861 by  ABOUT  5%, or 18 in 
5 years  (AVERAGE  of each year). This shows concentration.  But 2) in 
SILK, on the  other hand, where there  was  the  biggest increase  in the 
number  of  factories, there  was  also  a decline  in the  number  of 
workers,  and the  same thing occurred  in  WORSTED.

The  SPINDLES  must  be  looked into later.  So  here there  is 
enormous concentration.  The  amount  of  POWER  has  almost doubled 
in 5 years [1856-61]; thus  an  increase  of  almost  100%. The 
number  of people  EMPLOYED,  in contrast,  has  only grown  by  ABOUT 
8%. The  number  of factories  has  fallen. 
In WORSTED  the  growth  of factories  has  been very slight,  at 1%, 
and the  number  of workers  has  fallen. FACTORIES

ECONOMY  OF  POWER.  It says in the same Reports of the Inspectors of 
Factories  for 31st  October  1856:

additional force available  and in  motion  for  manufacturing purposes.  The  Return 
of 1838  gave  the  number  of steam engines  and of  waterwheels, with  the  amount  of 
horsepower employed.  At that time  the  figures represented  a much more accurate 
estimate  of the  actual power employed than  do the  figures  in the  Returns either  of 
1850  or 1856. The  figures given  in the  Returns  are all of the  nominal power  of the 
engines  and  wheels,  not of the  power actually employed  or capable  of being 
employed.  The  modern steam engine  of 100  horsepower  is capable  of being driven 
at a much greater force than formerly, arising from improvements  in its  construction,  the 
capacity  and  construction  of the boilers,  etc., and  thus  the  nominal power  of a  modern 
manufacturing steam engine cannot  be considered more than  an index from which 
its real capabilities  may be  calculated"* (I.e.,  [pp.]  13-14). 
"In the  Reports  for October  1852 Mr.  Horner quotes  *a  letter from James 
Nasmyth,  the  eminent civil engineer,  of Patricroft, near Manchester, explaining  at 
some length  the  nature  of recent improvements  in the  steam engine, whereby  the  same 
engine  can  be made  to perform more work with  a diminished consumption  of fuel.*  " It  says 
at the end of  this letter: 
* " 'It  would  not be  very easy  to get an  exact return  as to the  increase  of 
performance  or work done  by the  identical engines  to which some  or all of  these 
improvements have been applied;  I am  confident, however, that, could  we  obtain 
an exact return,  the  result would show that from  the  same weight  of steam-engine 
machinery  we are now  obtaining  at least  50%  more duty  or work performed  on the 
average,  and  that,  as said before,  in many cases  the  identical steam engines which,  in 
the days  of the  restricted speed  of 220  feet per  minute, yielded  50 horsepower,  are 
now yielding upwards  of 100'  " * [p. 14].a 
The Reports  for 31st  October  1856  comments  further: 
* "The  fact that  the  nominal horsepower  of the  steam engine  is but an  index  of 
its actual force, will  be further evident upon  a comparison  of horsepower  and 
machinery employed  in 1850 and 1856. In the  former period  the  factories  of the 
United Kingdom employed 134,217 nominal horsepower  to give motion  to 
25,638,716 spindles  and  301,445 looms.  The  number  of spindles  and  looms  in 
1856  was  respectively 33,503,580  of the  former  and  369,205  of the  latter, which, 
reckoning  the  force  of the  nominal horsepower required  to be the  same  as in 1850, 
would require  a force equal  to 175,000 horses,  but the  actual power given  in the 
Return  for 1856 is  161,435, less  by above 10,000 horses than, calculating upon  the 
basis  of the  return  of 1850, the  factories ought  to have required  in 1856. The 
number  of persons employed bears exactly  the  same proportion  for  nominal 
horsepower  as in 1838 and  1850, [XIX-1228]  viz.  four persons"* (I.e.,  [p]p.  14-15). 
The Reports  of the  Inspectors  of  Factories  for 31st  October  1856 
concludes  (in the  GENERAL  report): 
* "The  facts thus brought  out by the  Return appear  to be  that  the  factory 
system  is increasing rapidly; that although  the  same number  of hands  are 
employed  in proportion  to the  horsepower  as at  former periods, there  are  fewer 
hands employed  in proportion  to the  machinery; that  the  steam engine  is enabled  to 
drive  an increased weight  of machinery  by economy  of force,  and  other methods,  and 
that an increased quantity  of work  can be  turned  off by  improvements  in machinery,  and 
in methods  of manufacture,  by increase  of speed  of the machinery,  and by a  variety  of 
other causes" *  ([p.] 20).a

Child  labour. 
* "The educational clauses  of the  Factory  Act  being held  in such disfavour  by 
millowners" (Reports  of the Inspectors  of Factories  [...] 31st  October  1856, p. 66,  report 
of Sir  John Kincaid).* 
(One  only needs  to read these Reports  to be  convinced  of the 
"grotesque" way in which the clauses on schooling  ARE COMPLIED WITH. 
Daily  ATTENDANCE  FOR  SOME HOURS  AT  SCHOOL.) 
* "Children  who are  required  in cotton, woollen, worsted  and  flax factories  to 
attend school from  the age of 8  years  to that  of 13 are, if  employed  in 
silk-throwing mills, released from school  at 11  years  of age,  and are  then employed 
for full time. Even this very modified application  of the  half-time system  was  only 
required  by the  Factory  Act of 1844,  previous  to which time their exemption from 
the restrictions upon  the  labour  of children  was in  practice complete" (report  of 
Mr. Alexander Redgrave,  p. 77). 
"The so-called education clauses  in the  Factory Acts enact  no more than that 
the children shall attend  a school... Before  the  passing  of the Act of 1844, 
certificates  of school attendance were  not  very rare, which  had  been signed  by the 
schoolmaster  or schoolmistress with  a +, as  they were unable  to write.  On one 
occasion,  on  visiting  a place called  a school, from which certificates  of school 
attendance  had  issued,  I was so  struck with  the  ignorance  of the  master, that  I said 
to him,  'Pray,  Sir, can you  read?'  His  reply was—'Aye, summat (somewhat)!',  and as 
a justification  of his  right  to grant certificates,  he added,  'At any  rate,  I am  before 
my scholars.' 
"The Inspectors, when  the  Bill  of 1844 was in  preparation,  did not  fail to 
represent  the  disgraceful state  of the  places called schools, certificates from which 
they were obliged  to admit  as a  compliance with  the law; but  they were successful 
only in obtaining thus much, that since  the  passing  of the Act of 1844, the  figures 
in the  school certificate must  be filled  up in the  handwriting  of the schoolmaster,  who 
must also sign  his  Christian  and  surname  in full" (Reports  ... 31st  October  1855, 
[pp.] 18-19.  L. Horner).* 
[XIX-1229] That wretched apologist Macaulay says  in his 
HISTORY  OF ENGLAND  (Vol. I, [10th ed., London, 1854,] p. 417): 
* "The practice  of setting children prematurely  to work  ... prevailed  in the 17th 
century  to an  extent which, when compared with  the  extent  of the  manufacturing 
system,  seems almost incredible.  At Norwich,  the  chief seat  of the  clothing trade,  a 
little creature  of 6  years  old was  thought  fit for  labour. Several writers  of that time, 
and among them some  who  were considered  as eminently benevolent, mention, 
with exultation,  the  fact, that  in that single city boys  and  girls  of tender  age  created 
wealth exceeding what  was  necessary  for  their  own  subsistence  by 12,000 pounds  a 
year.  The  more carefully  we  examine  the  history  of the  past,  the  more reason shall 
we find  to dissent from those  who  imagine that  our age has  been fruitful  of new 
social evils.  The  truth  is, that  the  evils  are,  with scarcely  an exception,  old.  That 
which  is new is the  intelligence which discerns  and the  humanity which remedies 
them."3

"The Legislature  is alone  to blame,  by having passed  a delusive law, which, while 
it would seem  to provide that  the  children employed  in factories shall  be educated, 
contains  no  enactment  by which that professed  end can be  secured.  It provides 
nothing more than that  the  children shall  on certain days  of the  week,  and for a 
certain number  of hours  (3) on  each  day, be  inclosed within  the  four walls  of a 
place called  a school,  and  that  the  employer  of the  child shall receive weekly  a 
certificate  to that effect signed  by a  person designated  by the  subscriber  as a 
schoolmaster  or schoolmistress" (Reports  of the  Inspectors  of Factories  ... 30th June3 
1857, report  of L.  Horner, [p.]17).* 
Horner says  in the  same  report,  pp.  17-18: 
* "But  it is not  only  in the  miserable places above referred  to that  the  children 
obtain certificates  of school attendance without having received instruction  of any 
value,  for in  many schools where there  is a  competent teacher,  his  efforts  are of 
little avail from  the  distracting crowd  of children  of all  ages, from infants  of 3  years 
old and  upwards;  his  livelihood, miserable  at the  best, depending  on the  pence 
received from  the  greatest number  of children whom  it is  possible  to cram into  the 
space.  To this is to be  added scanty school furniture, deficiency  of books,  and  other 
materials  for  teaching,  and the  depressing effect upon  the  poor children 
themselves  of a  close, noisome atmosphere.  I have been  in many such schools, 
where  I have seen rows  of children doing absolutely nothing;  and  this is certified  as 
school attendance,  and, in  statistical returns, such children  are set  down  as being 
educated. 
"The effect  of the  half-time system appears  to have caused  the  employment  of 
the smallest number  of children  who  would  be subject  to that system" (Reports  of the 
Inspectors  of Factories  ... 30th June  1857,  report  of Mr.  Alexander Redgrave,  [p.] 78).* 
A very pretty example of  FACTORY EDUCATION  is to be seen in 
PRINTWORKS  (before these were entirely subject to the  FACTORY  ACT, 
i.e. before  1861?): 
[XIX-1230] * "The school attendance  of children employed  in printworks  is 
thus provided  for: 
"Every child before being employed  in a  printwork must have attended school 
for at least  30 days  and not  less than  150  hours during  the 6  months immediately 
preceding such first  day of  employment,  and  during  the  continuance  of its 
employment  in the  printwork  it must attend  for a  like period  of 30  days  and 150

"The attendance  at school must  be between  8 a.m. and 6 p.m. No  attendance  of 
less than  2 hours  and a  half  nor  more than  5 hours,  on any one day,  shall  be 
reckoned  as part  of the 150  hours. 
"Under ordinary circumstances  the  children attend school morning  and 
afternoon  for 30  days,  for at  least  5 hours each  day, and  upon  the  expiration  of 
the 30 days,  the  statutory total  of 150  hours having been attained—having  in their 
language 'made  up their book'—they return  to the  printwork, where they continue 
until  the 6  months have expired, when another instalment  of school attendance 
becomes  due, and  they again seek  the  school until  the  book  is again made  up...

printwork boys ... [they] have lost all that they gained by their previous school 
attendance" (Reports of the Inspectors of Factories ... 31st October 1857, report of 
Alexander Redgrave, [pp.] 41-42). 
"In other printworks the children's attendance at school is made to depend 
altogether upon the exigencies of the work in the establishment; the requisite 
number of hours is made up each 6 months by instalments consisting of from 3 to 
5 hours at a time, spreading over perhaps the whole six months... For instance, the 
attendance on one day might be from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., on another day from 
1 p.m. to 4 p.m., and the child might not appear at school again for several days, 
when it would attend, perhaps from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.; then it might attend for 3 or 
4 days consecutively or for a week, then it would not appear in school for 3 weeks 
or a month, after that, upon some odd days at some odd hours when the operative 
who employed it chose to spare it; and thus the child was, as it were, buffeted from 
school to work, from work to school, until the tale of 150 hours was told"* (I.e., 
[pp.] 42-43). 
Influence of the Ten Hours'  BILL  in increasing the intensity of labour. 
*"The great improvements that have been made in machinery, of all kinds, have 
vastly improved their productive powers; improvements to which a stimulus was 
doubtlessly given, especially as regards the greater speed of the machinery in a given time, 
by the restrictions of the hours of  work.  These improvements, [XIX-1231] and the closer 
application which the operatives are enabled to give, have had the effect ... of as much 
work being turned off in the shortened time as used to be in the longer hours" 
(Reports of the Inspectors of  Factories  ... 31st October 1858, report of L. Horner, [p.] 10).a 
"The Children's Employment Commission, the reports of which have been 
published several years, brought to light many enormities, which still continue— 
some of them much greater than any that factories and printworks were ever 
charged with"* (I.e., [p.] 10).

Age of the children and  INVENTIONS  TO GET RID OF TWO  SETS  OF HALF-TIMES. 
* "The mill-occupier requires juvenile labour  in his  factory,  and  obtains  it in the 
manner enjoined  by statute.  The  question  of real age  is one  with which  he does  not 
trouble  himself.  What  he looks  for in the  juvenile hands  is strength  to enable them 
to perform their respective work.  If the  child  has  strength  for the  work,  it is not a 
question  of whether  the  child  is of the age at  which  he may be  legally withdrawn 
from school  and  half-time employment,  but  whether  its appearance will justify  the 
certifying surgeon  in granting  to it a  full-time certificate  for  employment  in his 
factory...  My  attention  was  called  to an  advertisement which appeared  in the  local 
newspaper  of an  important manufacturing town  of my  district,  of which  the 
following  is a  copy: 
"'Wanted from  12 to 20  boys,  not  younger than what will pass  for 13  years  of 
age...  Wages  4s. per  week. Apply...'" (Reports  of the  Inspectors  of Factories  ... 31st 
October  1858,  report [XIX-1232]  of Alexander Redgrave,  [pp.]  40-41). 
"Thus there  are  frequently  two  antagonists  to the  half-time system  of education, 
the parent  who  seeks full-time wages,  and the  manufacturer  who  seeks  the  full-time 
worker. Most manufacturers, when  the  nature  of the  employment will permit  of 
the arrangement,  and  when  a sufficient supply  of older hands  can be  procured, 
dispense with  the  labour  of half-time children,  i.e.  children under  13 years  of age... 
The manufacturers  of textile fabrics have been singled  out, as it  were, from  all other 
manufacturers  by  whom children  are  employed..."* 
// Because it was in these factories that the  FACTORY SYSTEM  was 
first developed in its full  HIDEOUSNESS.  The  CHILDREN'S EMPLOYMENT 
COMMISSION  was actually called into being by these  MILLOWNERS,  in 
order  to  prove  the  existence  of as  great,  and  even  greater, 
ENORMITIES  in the other branches of  MANUFACTURING  and mining, in the 
coalmines,  and the  glass,  porcelain,  etc.,  factories.  // (I.e.,  [p.] 42.) 
* "Employers  of labour would  not  unnecessarily retain  2 sets of children under 
13 if they could obtain  a sufficient number  of children  fit for the  work above that 
age. In fact  one  class  of manufacturers,  the  spinners  of woollen yarn,  now  rarely 
employ children under  13  years  of age, i.e.  half-times."* 
(The expression is a good one. The workers are only  TIME, 
FULL-TIMES  or HALF-TIMES.) 
* " They have introduced improved  and new  machinery  of various kinds, which 
altogether supersedes  the  necessity  for the  employment  of children;  f.i.: I  will 
mention  one  process  ... wherein,  by the  addition  of an  apparatus, called  a piecing 
machine,  to existing machines,  the  work  of 6 or 4  half-times, according  to the 
peculiarity  of each machine,  can be  performed  by one  young person.  The  object  of 
improved machinery  is to  diminish manual labour,  to provide  for the  performance  of 
a process  or the  completion  of a  link  in a  manufacture  by the aid of an  iron instead 
of by the aid of the  human apparatus,  and  undoubtedly  the  half-time system  had 
some share  in stimulating  the  invention  of the  'piecing machine'" (I.e.,  [pp. 42-]

exclusive of coroner's cases, is 224, and of this number 156 were of children under 
5 years of age, leaving a total adult mortality of only 68. So large a proportion I 
have never known. It is evident that whilst the ordinary circumstances affecting 
adult life have been to a considerable extent in abeyance, those militating against 
the very young have been in great activity. Of the children, not less than 76 were 
carried off by diarrhoea, 14 by hooping cough, 6 by scarlatina, 6 by measles, and 
one by small-pox. 87 of the children died under the age of one year. Neglected 
diarrhoea, close confinement to ill-ventilated rooms during hooping cough, want of 
proper nutrition, and free administration of laudanum, producing marasmus and 
convulsions, as well as hydrocephalus and congestion of brain, these must explain 
why, with a diminution of the causes producing disease in adults, the mortality as a 
total is still so high" (Registrar-General's Quarterly Return, No. 35, p. 6).*a 
[XIX-1235] The aim in investigating relative surplus value is to 
find how necessary labour time is reduced by the growth in the 
productivity of labour, and thereby SURPLUS labour time, HENCE the 
SURPLUS VALUE which falls to the share of capital, is increased. An 
increase in the productivity of labour=a cheapening of the 
commodities which enter into the worker's consumption, and the 
value of labour capacity is determined by the value of those 
commodities. With machinery there is the additional element that 
cheap means of labour are replaced by expensive ones. Constant 
capital must therefore be investigated here—it must be taken into 
account—since a new element now enters into it (and also into the 
valorisation process). The forces of nature cost nothing; they enter 
into the labour process without entering into the valorisation 
process; but the PRIME MOTORS on which they act, or through which 
[they] are appropriated for the labour process, do cost something. 
The past labour contained in the constant capital forms a value 
component of the commodity, just as does the living labour 
obtained in exchange for the variable capital. If on the one hand 
the necessary (living) labour time were to fall, through an increase 
in the productivity of living labour, while on the other hand the 
value component of the commodity added by machinery were to 
rise in the same, or a higher, ratio, the commodity would become 
dearer instead of cheaper, and thus—despite the greater produc­
tivity of the living labour—no additional surplus value would be 
created; the surplus value would rather be lessened. For this 
reason, it is necessary to discuss already at this point, TO  A CERTAIN 
DEGREE, the share which the value component added by the value of 
the machinery to the commodity, to the product, accounts for in 
the total value of the commodity. 
On the other hand, it is clear in the case of the increase in the

productive forces of labour brought about by simple cooperation 
and division of labour,  d'abord,*  that the constant capital does not 
increase in proportion to the commodity; it is clear, secondly, that, 
even disregarding the higher productivity of living labour and 
therefore the lesser magnitude of value of the individual products, 
a cheapening of the commodity also takes place on account of economy 
in constant capital (particularly in the communal use of constant 
capital, parts of which, such as buildings, heating facilities, 
lighting, etc., do not increase in mass in the same proportion as 
the living labour they serve at the same time as general objective 
conditions of labour). In so far as the commodity is thereby 
cheapened—even disregarding the greater productivity of the 
living labour considered for itself—this circumstance can be 
mentioned, although we shall not examine it in more detail until 
the section on capital and profit. 4 
It is precisely the characteristic feature of capitalist production 
that while even the social characteristics of labour which raise its 
productive power appear as a force alien to labour  itself,  as 
conditions lying outside it, as qualities and conditions not belonging 
to labour itself—for the worker always continues to confront 
capital as an isolated individual, standing outside the social 
connection with his fellow-workers—this is still more the case, 
prima facie, with the objective conditions of that social labour."3 The 
examination of these conditions therefore appears from the 
capitalist point of view as the examination of circumstances which 
concern capital alone, proceed from it and are enclosed within it, 
and have absolutely nothing to do with the worker. This is so even 
though it is only this social form of labour itself that converts these 
external conditions from such as exist in isolation for the 
individual worker into social conditions, concentrated conditions, 
which can be employed more economically through concentration in 
space and time and common employment by the cooperating 
workers; can be employed in such a manner that the workers' 
greater  EFFICIENCY  in the labour process is accompanied by lesser 
costs,  i.e. a smaller consumption of value by the workers, so that 
they enter to a lesser degree into the valorisation process. 
We shall find, in connection with machinery in particular, how 
the alienation between these conditions of labour and the way in 
which the labour itself is carried on is held fast in the consciousness 
of the capitalist and asserted in his dealings with the worker.

This is, however, only a further consequence and carrying 
through of the antagonism which forms the essence [XIX-1236] of 
capitalist production, and was therefore already delineated in our 
discussion of absolute surplus value." 
It is, in general, a characteristic of capitalist production that the 
conditions of labour confront living labour as independent, as 
personified, that it is not the worker that employs the conditions 
of labour, but the conditions of labour that employ the worker. It 
is precisely through this that the latter become capital, and the 
commodity owner who possesses them becomes a capitalist vis-à-vis 
the worker. This independence naturally ceases in the actual 
labour process, but the total labour process is a process of capital, 
it is incorporated in capital. To the extent that the worker figures 
in the process as labour, he is himself a moment of capital. 
[V-175a/A]222  The vitalising natural power of labour—the fact 
that by using and expending material and instrument it preserves 
them in this or that form, hence also preserves the labour 
objectified in them, their exchange value—becomes a power, not of 
labour, but of capital, as does every natural or social power of 
labour which is not the product of earlier labour or not the 
product of such earlier labour as must be repeated (e.g. the 
historical development of the worker, etc.). Therefore, this 
vitalising power is not paid for by capital. Just as the worker is not 
paid for his capacity to think. 
Labour's specific quality of preserving already objectified labour 
as objectified labour by adding a new quantity of labour does not 
receive any remuneration; nor does it cost the worker anything, as it 
is a natural property of labour. In the process of production the 
separation of labour from the objective moments of its existence— 
material and instrument—is  superseded.  The existence of capital and 
wage labour depends on this separation. Its supersession which 
actually takes place in the actual production process, is not paid 
for by the capitalist. Nor does the supersession occur through 
the exchange between capitalist and worker, but through labour 
itself in the production process. And as such present labour it is it­
self already incorporated into capital, it is a moment of capital. 
This preserving power of labour therefore appears as ca-
a Ibid., Vol. 30, pp. 190-92.— Ed. 

=====第490页=====
480 Relative Surplus Value 
pital's power of self-preservation. The worker has merely 
added new labour; past labour—in which capital exists—has 
an eternal existence as value quite independently of its material 
existence. This is how the matter appears to capital and to the 
worker. 
[XIX-1236] With the formal subsumption of labour under 
capital, these conditions of labour undergo no further modifica­
tion; they remain, physically, material and means of labour. But 
with the new mode of production, with the revolution in the mode 
of production created by capitalist production, these conditions of 
labour change their shape. They receive new determinations from 
the fact that they serve the socially cooperating workers as 
conditions. With simple cooperation and manufacture based on 
the division of labour, this modification affects merely the general 
conditions of labour, which can be utilised commonly, such as 
buildings, etc. But with the mechanical workshop based on 
machinery, the modification extends to the actual instrument of 
labour. As with the formal subsumption of labour under capital, 
these conditions, and therefore also their altered shape—a shape 
which has been altered by the social form of the labour 
itself—remain an alien circumstance to the workers. Indeed, in the 
case of machinery, as we shall see further on, the antithesis or 
alienation develops further, into an antagonistic contradiction. 
A further question to be dealt with here is this: If we examine 
these conditions of labour, to the extent that they are cheapened in 
the social form of labour, this happens in relation to the 
cheapening of the commodities which enter into the worker's 
consumption, and this is identical with the relative devaluation of 
labour capacity. What is important here is that the total amount of 
labour which enters into the individual product—the sum total of 
the past and present labour entering into it—is lessened. With 
cooperation and the division of labour it is evident that the living 
labour becomes more productive, performs the same work in a 
shorter time, while it goes without saying that the part of the value 
of the commodity which derives from the constant capital is not 
increased. With machinery this needs to be demonstrated, and will 
be demonstrated. But the characteristic feature of all 3  CASES,  in so 
far as relative surplus value is being considered, is that the living 
labour needs less time to produce the same commodity. 
In the section on capital and profit, on the other hand, what is 
involved is neither the increase of surplus value, SURPLUS labour time,

which is rather presupposed as given; nor is it the reduction in the 
total amount of past and living labour which enters into the  commodity ; 
it is instead the way in which the ratio of the surplus value to the 
value of the total capital advanced, and in particular the quantitative 
proportion between the living labour employed and the past 
labour employed, is affected by the economy in constant capital 
which is first made possible by the social forms taken on by labour 
in the capitalist mode of production, but excluded, in contrast, in 
the case of the dispersed labour of independent handicraftsmen or 
small-scale agriculturists. *Such is the difference in the considera­
tion of the same circumstances from different points of view. * 
If we now return to machinery,3 it is evident that the mode of 
production corresponding to it finds its purest and most classical 
expression in the automatic workshop, in which the application of 
the machine takes the form of the application of a connected 
system of machinery, of a totality—falling into a number of 
different phases—of mechanical processes which have as their 
common motor a PRIME MOTOR driven mechanically, with the drive 
provided by natural forces.b The single machine makes its 
appearance in many spheres of production, replacing [XIX-1237] 
either earlier individual trades of the handicraft type, or kinds of 
work previously performed through cooperation, such as, in the 
latter case, building machines, [or] e.g. sowing, mowing, threshing 
machines, etc. There is, particularly in the first case, a re-
emergence of handicraft production, based now on machinery, 
such as with the original spinning machine, many kinds of loom, 
the sewing machine, etc. But this handicraft production based on 
the machine now appears as nothing more than a transition to 
large-scale industry. Or, in manufacture (and agriculture) based 
on the division of labour, the machines intervene in specific 
processes, while other processes, which are admittedly connected 
with the former processes, but still interrupt mechanical produc­
tion, require human labour, not for the supervision of a 
mechanical process, but for the production  itself.  This is the way 
in which manufacture and large-scale agriculture reappear, in 
changed shape, in the period of machine production. 
The automatic workshop, however, is a perfected mode of 
production, corresponding to machinery, and it is the more

perfect,  the  more  it forms  a complete mechanical system,  and the 
less individual processes still require  (as do  mechanical spinning 
mills  not  employing  SELFACTORS)  to be  mediated through human 
labour. 
Machinery  has a  negative impact  on the  mode  of production 
resting  on the  division  of  labour  in  manufacture  and on the 
specialised skills  of labour capacity produced  on the  basis  of that 
division  of labour.  It devalues  the  labour capacity specialised  in 
this way, in  part reducing  it to  simple, abstract labour capacity, 
and in  part producing  on its own  basis  a new  specialisation  of 
labour capacity,  the  characteristic feature  of which  is its  passive 
subordination  to the  movement  of the  mechanism  itself;  its 
complete annexation  to the  needs  and  requirements  of the 
mechanism. 
//The Ricardian example  (PRINCIPLES  OF  POLITICAL  ECONOMY,  3RD ED., 
[p.] 469  sqq.): 
Let the  capitalist have £20,000. 7,000  of this  is INVESTED  IN FIXED 
CAPITAL;  13,000 as  CIRCULATING CAPITAL EMPLOYED  IN THE  SUPPORT  OF LABOUR. 
Now machinery  TO THE  AMOUNT  OF 7,500 is added to the  FIXED CAPITAL 
of 7,000. Hence  the  total  FIXED CAPITAL  now=7,000+7,500= 14,500. 
There therefore remains  a circulating capital  of 20,000—14,500, 
i.e. 5,500. Previously  the  GROSS PRODUCE  was  15,000, hence  a profit  of 
£2,000.  Or Vio on  20,000,= 10%. 
The extra labour previously employed  by  "7,500"  "WOULD BECOME REDUNDANT" 
[p. 471]. 
Ricardo  now  continues: 
* "The reduced quantity  of labour which  the  capitalist  can  employ, must, indeed, 
with the  assistance  of the  machine,  and  after deductions  for its  repairs, produce  a 
value equal to £7,500,  it must replace  the  circulating capital with  a profit  of £2,000 
on the  whole capital"*  ([p.] 471). 
I.e. the  amount  of surplus value  and  therefore  the  rate  of profit 
(10%)  on the  £20,000 remains exactly  the  same, although  now  less 
than half the  QUANTITY  OF  LABOUR  IS EMPLOYED,  compared with previously. 
Previously  the  variable capital  was  13,000,  now it is  only 5,500. 
The phrase,  "WITH  THE  ASSISTANCE  OF THE  MACHINE"  means nothing here, 
since Ricardo himself argues,  as against Say, that  the  machine only 
adds its own value (as  INCLUDED  IN ITS ANNUAL  wear and tear) to the 
product;  but no  surplus value. Ricardo does  not  investigate  how 
this  "FACT"  can be reconciled with the  THEORY  OF VALUE,  which it 
contradicts prima facie.*//

Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 483 
*" Machine, or engine, is any mechanical instrument contrived to move bodies. 
And it is composed of the mechanical powers. Mechanical powers are certain simple 
instruments, commonly employed for raising greater weights, or overcoming greater 
resistances, than could be effected by the natural strength without them. These are 
usually accounted 6 in number, viz. the lever, the wheel and axle, the pulley, the 
inclined plane, the wedge, and the screw" * (Hutton, A Course of Mathematics, 
[pp.] 174-75).223 
The mechanical workshop takes the place of 1) manufacture 
based on the division of labour; 2) the independent handicraft 
enterprise. 
Although the mechanical workshop 1) negates simple coopera­
tion, in so far as it puts the machine in the place of power created 
through cooperation; and 2) negates the division of  labour,  in so far 
as it abolishes cooperation or manufacture resting on the division 
of labour, there does nevertheless occur within the mechanical 
workshop itself both cooperation and division of labour. Point 1 
needs no further discussion here. It should however be remarked 
that, given machinery as the material basis of the mechanical 
workshop, simple cooperation plays a much more important role 
in it than the division of labour. 
[XIX-1238] But what is above all involved here is this question: 
what kind of division of labour is it which predominates in the 
mechanical workshop, as opposed to the kind which characterises 
manufacture? 
There are two points to distinguish here. 
Either, a), machinery develops into a system of machines, which 
perform different processes, each of which forms a phase for the 
next one, as in spinning, paper manufacturing, etc. Here there 
naturally emerges a new division of labour, which belongs to the 
mechanical workshop, and which must be examined specifically.3 
Or, b), a system of this kind does not result; for we do not 
understand by this system merely the link between MOTIVE POWER, 
transmitting machinery, and working machinery. This link can be 
found in all mechanical factories without distinction. Two things 
are, in turn, possible here. 
a) Either a handicraft is replaced by a machine,b as e.g. the 
handloom is replaced by the mechanical loom, or the turner's 
bench is replaced by a mechanical lathe. Here the mechanical 
workshop directly replaces handicraft work, and machines of this 
kind can also bring into existence a new kind of handicraft work. 
Once they have developed into a mechanical workshop, what 
a See this volume, p. 486.— Ed. 
b Ibid., p. 481.—  Ed.

characterises this workshop is cooperation. Many such machines (set 
in motion by the same motor and the transmission apparatus 
connected to it) work together at the same place and the same 
time,  and there is therefore added to them a large number of 
human machine assistants, working alongside each other simul­
taneously. Whether a machine of this kind is operated in isolation 
by a small master with a pair of assistants, or a number of them 
work together, the handicraftsman, who performed various 
operations and whose labour represented a larger or smaller 
totality of pieces of work, is replaced by a single machine, which 
performs these operations simultaneously. This handicrafsman is 
replaced by a mere assistant to the machine. The same thing takes 
place in the mechanical workshop composed of many such 
machines. Only there is the difference that in the first case power 
was still developed in so far as  MAN  still remained the  PRIME MOTOR 
with this machine too, whereas in the workshop man is replaced 
with an automaton, a mechanical driving force. No division of 
labour in our sense took place here. It is therefore not abolished. 
What is abolished is a more complex kind of labour, comprising 
various activities, which is replaced by simple machine labour. By 
simple machine labour we understand the assistance man has to 
render to the working machine. 
ß) But if a machine of this kind replaces a manufacture based 
on the division of labour, examples of which we have just given, 
this rests directly on a negation of the division of labour. The 
specialisation achieved by labour capacity through the division of 
labour is destroyed, and labour capacity is therewith depreciated, in 
so far as the system of manufacture required a hierarchy of labour 
capacities, so that there was simple labour at one point and, 
corresponding to it, more complex labour at another. Simpler 
labour now replaces simple labour; though simple, the latter was 
still specific, and had therefore developed into a specialised skill, 
however lousy the work might be. Here the system of manufacture 
can turn back into handicrafts, i.e. the work can be carried on by 
independent small masters with a pair of assistants; but this is 
always to be regarded as no more than a transitional stage to the 
mechanical workshop. 
In so far as a division of labour takes place here, it proceeds 
solely from the general structure of the mechanical workshop; 
hence from the distinction,  d'abord,  between. PRIME MOTOR and 
working machine. The former may require stokers, FEEDERS of the 
PRIME MOTOR with coal, water, etc., or also the clearing out of ashes, 
etc. Workers employed in this way, whose numbers are limited by 

=====第495页=====
Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 485 
the small number of PRIME MOTORS in operation in a workshop, are 
mere menials. The principle of the division of labour here is not 
that a particular specialism is developed, but that certain simple 
functions can be performed by one person for many, just as well 
on a large as on a small scale. E.g., a furnace can be heated for 
many just as it can for a few. Secondly, there are services 
performed for the machine as such, in order to keep it in constant 
REPAIR. Thus there are workers charged with the sharpening e.g. 
[XIX-1239] of carding machines, or mechanics and engineers 
attached to the workshop. Individual persons can only be attached 
in this way because there is a large quantity of machines working 
simultaneously, hence there is constantly something to be patched 
up, etc., friction to be removed, so that the whole of the time of 
such a man can be USEFULLY employed. There are naturally only a 
small number of these people, who do no "machine labour", but 
are attached to the workshop after being selected from the circle 
of those accessory workers required to set up the workshop 
(machine producers, handicraftsmen, etc.). 
Finally, menials are needed to sweep up the waste, remove the 
debris of the workshop, etc. This is one of the main tasks of the 
children (in the sense of the English FACTORY ACTS). This kind of 
labour has nothing to do with machine labour as such; it is merely 
a menial function. One cannot speak here of the development of a 
particular specialism, but only of menial tasks, which do not 
demand power or presuppose the development of any sort of 
specialised skill. //In the case of the LACE machine women and 
children have to perform machine labour.// 
These categories are to be found in every workshop (mechani­
cal), as also in manufacture, in part. 
But the workers who really supervise the operation of the 
machines, or the main body of workers properly so called, are 
people who all do the same thing, so that here there is no actual 
division of labour, but instead simple cooperation; the economic 
basis of its effect here is not cooperation among human beings, 
but the circumstance that economy is demanded where a common 
motor and transmission machinery are used for many similar 
machines (leaving aside buildings, etc., which is also characteristic 
of manufacture resting on simple cooperation). 
But finally, in so far as firstly children are required here for 
wholly simple menial services, and on the other hand young 
people of both sexes and women are required for the actual 
machine labour, a new division of labour emerges, found already 
in handicrafts, and in slave labour resting on cooperation, namely 
32-613

between  OVERLOOKERS  and actual workers.3 This division of labour 
arises from the need for discipline and supervision in the armies 
of workers, as in other armies, and has nothing to do with the 
development of specialisation, unless it be specialisation in 
checking, giving orders, and cavilling. These OVERLOOKERS in fact 
represent the capitalist towards the workers. In the case of the 
small handicraft master, who works with a few journeymen, this 
work of supervision and command, the disciplinary power, is 
bound up with his cooperation in the work. With the industrial 
capitalist, this  LABOUR  OF SUPERINTENDENCE,  which is "his", is performed 
by workers delegated by him. These are the NCO's of the 
workshop. It is in fact the  OVERLOOKERS  and not the capitalists who 
perform the real  LABOUR  OF SUPERINTENDENCE.  The mechanical work­
shop is altogether characterised by these relations of subordina­
tion, regimentation, just as under the system of slavery the ruling 
mode of cooperation is slave-driving Negro slaves and working 
Negro slaves. It is labour for the exploitation of labour. 
With both the kind of mechanical workshop just examined and 
the one that rests on a system of machinery—whether these two 
kinds of workshop replace independent handicrafts or manufac­
ture—very skilled labour is often replaced by simple machine 
labour, as in the mechanical workshop, and special skills are always 
destroyed. 
a) We come now to the mechanical workshop based on a system 
of machinery}"  Here a division of labour naturally takes place. //It is 
not necessary to repeat here the characteristics this kind of 
mechanical workshop has in common with the one considered 
above, characteristics which therefore apply to the mechanical 
workshop in general// This division of labour has its material basis 
in the differences between the specialised machines which perform 
specific phases of the production process, and for the service of 
which there are therefore allotted parties of workers trained and 
assigned exclusively to that purpose. Here too the main body of 
workers is always formed by those employed in the final 
operation, not by those employed in preliminary or subsequent 
work. There is added here a new kind of menial service, which 
falls to the children to perform, namely when the transfer of the 
object of labour from one machine to another is accomplished not 
by the machine [XIX-1240] itself but by human vehicles, who in

fact form here only the porters, the arms and legs, who act as 
intermediaries in the transfer of the material from one machine to 
another. Differences of age and sex play a major role here, in so 
far as certain manipulations require somewhat more strength, 
physical size, etc., and, according to the nature of the material to 
be worked on, more dexterity, agility, or, particularly with hard 
materials, a greater power of resistance. 
In manufacture the TASKS are divided into a hierarchy of abilities 
and strength, depending on what is required to make use of the 
instruments, and on whether the skills demanded for this are 
easier or harder to achieve. Certain physical and mental qualities 
of the individuals are here  SEIZED  UPON,  in order through their 
one-sided development to create in manufacture a total mechan­
ism formed out of human beings themselves. Here, in the 
mechanical workshop, the body of this total mechanism consists of 
the differentiated machines themselves, each of which performs 
the particular special processes, following one upon the other in 
succession, which are required for the process as a whole. Here it 
is not a specially developed labour capacity which puts into service 
a particular instrument in a skilled fashion, it is instead the 
self-acting instrument which needs special and constantly attached 
servants. There the worker puts into service a particular instru­
ment; here particular groups of workers serve various machines, 
which perform particular processes. The hierarchy of abilities 
which more or less characterises manufacture disappears here. 
What distinguishes this mechanical workshop is rather a general 
equalisation of services, so that for those really employed in 
machine labour the transition from one machine to another is 
entirely possible, within a short period of time, and without great 
preparations. In manufacture, the division of labour proceeds 
from the fact that the particular  TASKS  to be performed can only be 
performed by particular specialised labour capacities, hence that 
not only distribution but real division of the labour into groups of 
specialisations must take place. With the mechanical workshop, in 
contrast, it is the machines which are specialised, and their 
simultaneous functioning, although they perform successive phases 
of the same total process, requires the distribution among them of 
particular groups of workers, who are always entrusted with the 
same services—which are all equally simple. It is a distribution of 
the workers among specialised machines rather than a division of 
labour among specialised labour capacities. In the one case, the 
labour capacity which puts into service the particular instruments is 
specialised; in the other case, the machine served by particular 
32*

groups  of workers  is specialised. Leaving aside  the  mere menials 
mentioned previously  and  newly occurring here,  the  main 
distinction  is between strength  and  agility.  In so far as  strength  is to 
be employed, this  is merely  the  average strength possessed  by every 
adult  MALE  as distinct from  FEMALES  and  children. This  can  therefore 
be reduced  to a  simple difference  of sex and age. But the  agility 
and dexterity which  is demanded,  and  similarly  the  quickness  of 
observation,  and  altogether  the  highly strained attentiveness 
required, have  to do  with  the  fact that  the  rapidity  of functions  at 
the machine runs parallel with  the speed  of the  machine  itself, and 
that a number  of these machines, each  of which  has  many 
functions, have simultaneously  to be  served,  e.g. in the  connecting 
up of threads.  In large part this kind  of agility—leaving aside  the 
fact that practice, habit,  is the  main thing here—requires  in turn 
no particular special skill,  but a  degree  of application peculiar  to 
e.g. certain ages, more characteristic  of the  undeveloped (youthful) 
body than  the  developed  one. All  these services  are  distinguished 
by their passivity, their adaptation  and  subordination  to the 
operations  and  motions  of the  machine  itself.  This specialisation  in 
passivity,  i.e. the  abolition  of specialisation itself  as specialisation,  is 
what characterises machine labour. Improvements within  the mechani­
cal workshop itself  are  aimed  at removing  as far as  possible  all the 
skills which have again grown  up on its own  basis.  It is  therefore 
completely simple labour,  i.e. [labour characterised  by]  uniformity, 
emptiness  and  subordination  to the  machine. Deadening labour,  as 
labour which [XIX-1241] requires  the  complete subsumption  of 
the individual under  it, just  as with  the  division  of labour  in 
manufacture.  It prevents  the  development  of specialisation,  but is 
itself  in turn specialised  in this lack  of specialisation. Here  the  last 
remnant  of the  worker's satisfaction  in his own  labour disappears, 
to be replaced  by absolute indifference, which  is itself conditioned 
by the  labour's lack  of real content. 
In manufacture, labour  is continuous.  In the  mechanical 
workshop, attentiveness  to the  work  of the  machine  is continuous, 
and so is the  movement  of the  worker, conditioned  by the 
movements  of the  machine (where  the  worker must move 
backwards  and  forwards with  the  machine).  His  real interventions, 
in contrast,  are  incidental, according  to whether  the  machine  has 
made  an  ERROR  or not.  Here, therefore,  the  worker  is in  constant 
servitude  to the  machine, whereas  in manufacture  the  instrument 
always remains  the  servant. 
In manufacture—considered  as a  whole—the individual worker 
forms  a living part  of the  machine  as a  whole,  i.e. the  workshop, 

=====第499页=====
Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 489 
which is itself a mechanism consisting of human beings. In the 
mechanical workshop, on the other hand (i.e. the workshop 
considered here, which has developed into a system of machinery), 
man is a living accessory to its aggregate body, which exists outside 
him in the shape of the machine, and to the automatic machinery. 
Yet the machinery as a whole consists of machines, which form 
parts of that whole. Here human beings are merely the living 
accessories, the conscious appendages, of the unconscious but 
uniformly operating machinery. 
The mechanical workshop is characterised by cooperation (sim­
ple) and the distribution of the cooperating agents among the 
various parts of the whole of the big automaton, as its mobile 
accessories and servants; by subordination to the movements and 
operations of the machine, to which the worker is chained as to his 
fate;  by the equivalence of all kinds of work and by passivity; and 
by the absence of specialisation or at most the development of 
mere differences of age and sex into specialisations. Discipline and 
subordination arise here not merely from cooperation but from 
subordination to the system of machinery as a whole. 
Ure, who is notorious even in England as the shameless apologist 
of the factory system, nevertheless performed a service in being 
the first to grasp its spirit correctly, and sharply to characterise the 
distinction and the antithesis between the automatic workshop and 
the system of manufacture based on the division of labour, which 
was treated by Adam Smith as the most important thing. (This to 
be brought in later.) The removal of the hierarchy of skills; the 
destruction of the specialisations entrenched behind "the division 
of labour", and therewith the introduction of a passive subordina­
tion—with its accompaniment of absolute discipline, regimenta­
tion, subjection to the clock and the rules of the factory—these 
things are very properly picked out by Ure, as we shall now see 
from certain extracts.3 The regained universality of the worker in 
this system exists only in  itself,  in so far as he is indifferent towards 
his labour, the content of which lies outside him, and in so far as 
he develops no specialisation. In reality, however, this is the 
development of a specialisation without content. 
[XX-1242] 10 Whereas under handicrafts, and even in manu­
facture, the movements of a human being direct those of the 
instrument, the reverse is the case in the mechanical workshop: 
the movements of the machinery direct those of the human being.

Sir David Barry: 
"The indispensable necessity"  (for the  workers)  "of  forcing both their mental 
and bodily exertions  to keep exact pace with  the  motions  of machinery propelled 
by an unvarying, unceasing power.  2) The  continuance  of an  erect posture  for 
periods unnaturally prolonged  and too  quickly repeated.  To  these causes are often 
added dusty rooms; impure  air,  heated atmospheres, constant perspiration" 
(Engels,  [Die  Lage der  arbeitenden Klasse  in England,]  p. 193). a 
"The slavery  in which  the  bourgeoisie holds  the  proletariat chained,  is nowhere 
more conspicuous than  in the  factory system. Here ends  all freedom  in law and in 
fact. The  operative must  be in the  mill at half-past five  in the morning;  if he  comes 
a couple  of minutes  too  late, he is  fined;  if he  comes  ten  minutes too late,  he is not 
let in until breakfast  is over,  and a  quarter  of the day's wages  is withheld.  He  must 
eat, drink,  and  sleep  at command...  The  despotic bell calls  him  from  his  bed,  his 
breakfast,  his  dinner. 
"What  a time  he has of it,  too, inside the factory! Here the employer  is absolute 
law-giver;  he makes regulations  at will, changes  and  adds  to his  codex  at pleasure, 
and even  if he  inserts  the  craziest  stuff,  the  courts  say to the  working man: Now, 
when  you  have freely entered into this contract,  you  must  be bound  by it"  (Engels, 
pp. 217-18  [p.  467]). 
The whole  of this lawmaking boils down  to fines  or deductions 
from wages. 
Engels quotes this from  a regulation: 
"'6) Every operative detected speaking  to another, singing  or whistling, will  be 
fined  6d.; for  leaving  his  place during working hours,  6d.' 
"It may  be said that such rules  are  necessary  in a  great, complicated factory,  in 
order  to insure  the  harmonious working  of the  different parts;  it may  be asserted 
that such  a severe discipline  is as  necessary here  as in an  army. This may  be so, but 
what sort  of a  social order  is it  which cannot  be maintained without such shameful 
tyranny?... Every  one who has  served  as a  soldier knows what  it is to be  subjected 
even for a  short time  to military discipline.  But  these operatives  are  condemned 
from their ninth year  to their death  to live under  the  sword, physically  and 
mentally" (I.e.,  [p.] 219 [p.  468]). 
"But it is far  more shameful yet, that according  to the  universal testimony  of the 
operatives, numbers  of  manufacturers collect  the  fines imposed upon  the 
operatives with  the  most heartless severity,  and for the  purpose  of piling  up extra 
profits  out of the  farthings thus extorted from  the  impoverished proletarians" 
([p.] 220 [p.  469]). 
This  is the  only legislation  in the  world—these  are the  only  CODES 
of law in the world (the slaveholder AT  LEAST  DISPENSES  WITH  THIS  MOCK 
LEGISLATION)—the  confessed purpose  of  which  is nothing else than 
to "enrich"  the  legislator  as far as  possible  at the  expense  of his 
subjects;  a legislator  who  only  AIMS  AT the  extortion  of  money  for 
his private advantage. 
And  it is  precisely  the  apologists  of the  factory system, such  as Ure,

the apologists of this complete de-individualisation of labour, 
confinement in barrack-like factories, military discipline, subjuga­
tion to the machinery, regulation by the stroke of the clock, 
surveillance by overseers, complete destruction of any develop­
ment in mental or physical activity, who vociferate against 
infringements of individual freedom and the free movement of 
labour at the slightest sign of state intervention. 
"Overwork  and forced work" (Engels, [p.] 151 [p. 416]). 
"As voluntary, productive activity is the highest enjoyment known to us, so is 
compulsory  toil the most cruel, degrading punishment"  (I.e.,  [p.] 149 [p. 415]). 
The machines "work against the workers, not for them"  (I.e.,  [p.] 173 [p. 433]). 
"The collecting" of both sexes and all ages in a single work-room, 
the inevitable contact between them, the crowding into a small space 
of people, to whom neither mental nor moral education has been 
given [XX-1243] and the accumulation of a number of relatively 
"raw" people in a workroom, are all characteristic of the 
mechanical workshop [p. 441]. 
FULL-TIMERS—HALF-TIMERS—this  way of describing workers who 
work full time and children who work only half time, which is not 
only used by the English manufacturers, but occurs officially in the 
FACTORY  REPORTS, is much more characteristic of the factory system 
than the distinction between  MASTERS  and HANDS. Here the workers 
are purely and simply personified labour time, and the character of 
capitalist production emerges in its pure form. Age differences are 
reduced to full-timers and half-timers, IOV2 hours and 6 hours. The 
workers are merely personified hours. 
"The time of children, which should be devoted solely to their physical and 
mental  development," is sacrificed to "the greed of an unfeeling bourgeoisie. The 
children  are withdrawn from school and the fresh air so that they can be exploited 
for the benefit of the manufacturers"  (I.e.,  [p.] 187 [p. 443]). 
There can be no doubt that the factory system sacrifices women 
and children more than any other system. Moreover, the 
preponderance of women and children in the mechanical work­
shops breaks the resistance [of the workers] and adds a passive 
element which also condemns the adults to slavery, to passive 
subordination. 
"Let us hear how they ('the humane bourgeoisie') acted before the factory 
inspector  was at their heels. Their own admitted testimony shall convict them in the 
Report  of the Factories' Inquiry Commission of 1833"  (I.e.,  p. 187 sqq. [ibid.]).

"of which the first two were never enforced, and the last only here and there. 
The Act of 1831 (Sir J. C. Hobhouse) provided that in cotton mills no one under 
21 should be employed between half-past seven at night and half-past five in the 
morning; and that in all factories young persons under 18 should work no longer 
than twelve hours daily, and nine hours on Saturday" ([p.] 208 [pp. 459-60]). 
The introduction of child labour brought the worker to the point 
of selling, instead of his own labour, that of his children, therefore 
selling his children and conducting a slave trade with them. This 
brought about an essential change in the relation between 
capitalist and worker, for the buyers of labour capacity are no longer 
faced with sellers of their own labour, but with sellers of alien labour, 
of labour capacities which are capable neither of taking responsi­
bility, nor of entering into a contract. The married worker 
endeavours to recover by the sale of his children what the adult 
worker loses through the competition of child labour. Here, then, 
there is not even the form of the contract, which characterises the 
relation between capital and labour, the formal freedom of the 
two contracting parties, for it is not children who make contracts, 
but their parents who make them on their  behalf.  An English TORY 
writer says on this subject: 
•"Infant labour has been called in to aid them"* (the adult workers) * "and 
even to work for their own daily bread. Without strength to endure such 
disproportionate toil, without instruction to guide their future life, they have been 
thrown into a situation morally and physically polluted!... The Jewish historian has 
remarked upon the overthrow of Jerusalem, by Titus, that it was no wonder it 
should have been destroyed, with such a signal destruction, when one inhuman 
mother sacrificed her offsping to satisfy the cravings of absolute hunger" * (Public 
Economy Concentrated etc., Carlisle, 1833, [p.] 66). 
[XX-1244] The factory system includes the sale of children by 
their parents, and at the same time the annihilation of the physical 
and mental development of the workers in embryo, i.e. in the years 
of their childhood. 
We always proceed here from the assumption that labour 
capacity is paid at its value, and we therefore do not have to 
consider the real movement of wages here. It nevertheless results 
from the factors determining the  AVERAGE  VALUE  of wages that the 
value of labour capacity includes a wage sufficient to support the 
family of the worker. Since the factory system converts women 
and children into wage labourers who have to earn their own 
subsistence, the value of labour capacity is thereby depreciated, 
not only because women and children emerge as competitors of 
the other workers, but also because the  AVERAGE  VALUE  is now paid, 
and this value is divided among all members of the family. A 
RICARDIAN, De Quincey, remarks correctly on this:

Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop 493 
*"The numerical increase of labourers has been great, through the growing 
substitution of female for male and above all of childish for adult, labour. Three 
girls of 13, at wages of 6 to 8s. a week",* //much too high!// "in their myriads 
displaced *the one man of mature age, at wages varying from 18s. to 45"* 
(Thomas de Quincey, The Logic of Political Economy, Edinburgh, 1844, [p.] 147, 
note). a 
There is therefore no doubt at all that the  AVERAGE  VALUE  of labour 
capacity is thereby brought down, devalued, or that this is a direct 
consequence of the mechanical workshop, which requires neither 
muscle power, nor skilled labour, the learning of which can only 
be begun at a more mature age, and then can only be brought to 
the required level of virtuosity through long years of apprentice­
ship.  One of the first results of the factory system was the abolition 
of APPRENTICESHIP. 
"The result of the Commission set up by the English bourgeois themselves was 
the Factory Act of 1833, which forbade the employment of children under nine 
years of age (except in silk mills), limited the working-hours of children between 
9-13 years to 48 per week, or 9 hours in any one day at the utmost; that of young 
persons from 14-18 years of age to 69 per week, or 12 on any one day as the 
maximum, provided for an hour and a half as the minimum interval for meals, 
and repeated the total prohibition of night-work for persons under 18 years of age. 
Compulsory school attendance two hours daily was prescribed for all children 
under 14 years, and the manufacturer declared punishable in case of employing 
children without a certificate of age from the factory surgeon, and a certificate of 
school attendance from the teacher... Further, surgeons and inspectors were 
appointed" ([p.] 211 [F. Engels, The Condition of the Working-Class in England, 
pp. 461-62]). 
How much this system is based on the devaluation of labour 
capacity is shown by its immanent polemic against education, of 
which there are examples above. It requires as a conditio [sine qua 
non] the non-development of these production machines! 
In 1844, under Peel's ministry, 672 hours' labour for children 
between 8 and 13, 12 (from 6 o'clock in the morning until the 
evening, including mealtimes) for workers over 13. 
"Surplus value" can only be extracted through 
"the barbarous treatment of the operatives, the destruction of their health, the 
social, physical, and mental decay of whole generations" (Engels, p. 215 [p. 466]). 
What distinguishes the factory system is the fact that in it the 
true nature of surplus value emerges. Surplus labour, and therefore 
the question of labour time, becomes decisive here. But time is IN 
FACT the active existence of the human being. It is not only the 
measure of human life. It is the space for its development. And 
the ENCROACHMENT  OF CAPITAL  OVER  the  TIME  OF LABOUR  is the appropriation 
of the life, the mental and physical life, of the worker.

494 Relative Surplus Value 
[XX-1245] Machine labour does away with the all-round 
exertion of the muscles, it offers no opportunity for physical 
activity. Nor does it allow any mental activity. It prevents 
"the worker from occupying his mind with other things" (I.e., [p.] 216 [ibid.]), 
and in addition it takes control of this mind and body when it is 
still in an immature state. 
It is, 
"properly speaking, not work, but tedium, the most deadening, wearing process 
conceivable" (I.e., [p.] 216 [ibid.]). 
"The engine moves unceasingly; the wheels, the straps, the spindles hum and 
rattle in his ears without a pause, and if he tries to snatch one instant, there is the 
overlooker at his back with the book of fines. This condemnation to be buried 
alive, to give constant attention to the tireless machine is felt as the keenest torture" 
([p.] 216 [ibid.]). 
"The dull routine of a ceaseless drudgery, in which the same mechanical 
process is incessantly repeated, resembles the labour3  of Sisyphus—the toil, like the 
rock, recoils perpetually on the wearied operative. The mind gathers neither stores 
nor strength from the constant work of the same muscles" (Dr. J. P. Kay) (Engels, 
I.e. [p.] 217, note [p. 467]). 
The two books by Dr. Ure and Frederick Engels are absolutely 
the best on the factory system, and are identical in the field they 
cover; the difference being that what Ure expresses as the servant 
of the system, a servant whose horizons are confined within the 
system, is expressed by Engels as a free critic. 
Engels remarks, in relation to the small masters in Birmingham, 
that the worker is in an even worse position here. 
"The many small employers cannot well subsist on the profit divided amongst 
them, determined by competition, a profit under other circumstances absorbed by 
a single manufacturer" ([p.] 241 [pp. 488-89]). 
This is true in general with the fall in the rate of profit which is 
inseparable from the coming of large-scale industry. The small 
masters, who have to divide among themselves the profit otherwise 
absorbed by a single  employer,  are in such a lousy situation that they 
themselves have to force down the workers' wages to an abnormal 
degree. 
In the London dress-making establishments there is a mass of 
young girls, 15,000 of them, who work 15 to 18 hours a day for 
4 months of the year, during the SEASON. In most of these 
establishments the girls never sleep more than 6 hours, often 
only 3 or 4, occasionally only 2 hours in 24, when they don't have 
to work through the whole night. The only limit set to their work is 
the absolute physical inability to hold the needle another minute. 
a Engels has "torment".— Ed.

"Cases have occurred in which these helpless creatures did not undress during 
9 consecutive days and nights, and could only rest a moment or two here and there 
upon a mattress, where food was served them ready cut up in order to require the 
least possible time for swallowing. In short, these unfortunate girls are kept by 
means of the moral slave-driver's whip, the threat of discharge, to such long and 
unbroken toil as no strong man, much less a delicate girl of 14 to 20 years, can 
endure" ([p.] 253 [p. 498]). 
The same can be said of the needlewomen of London. 
[XX-1246] The large-scale industrial system has been put into 
effect: 
1) in FACTORIES proper; 
2) in manufactories, which all now employ machines to some 
degree; 
3) in agriculture. 
In all these one finds a system of production on a large  scale.  The 
number of workers is relatively small in proportion to the product 
produced by them in all these spheres together. Hence the large 
number of workers and particularly children and women workers 
who are simply exploited in attic rooms; where, without any real 
development in the productivity of labour, both the amount of 
surplus value created and the quantity of products depend 
exclusively on SURPLUS LABOUR and on paying only what is absolutely 
essential. This applies to the human material set free by the great 
system and therefore obliged to subject itself to every condition, 
even such in which the frightful consequences of this system 
emerge still more clearly than directly in the system itself—above 
all of course in those handicraft enterprises related to the factory, 
into which the whole of the surplus population is thrown, but then 
in all those spheres of labour which capital exploits formally, 
without giving rise to a capitalist mode of production in them, 
although the latter must ultimately take over, as in the cases of 
tailoring, sewing, baking, fancy weaving, lace making, etc., and 
then in fact even appears as an advance and an ALLEVIATION of the 
situation! Apologists of the system, such as Ure, therefore point to 
the atrocities of the system of labour produced outside the factory 
system by the factory system itself—whether under the small 
masters or under an enterprise only formally capitalist—in order 
to prove the relative beauties and advantages of the system  itself! 
They only forget that those branches of labour are so to speak 
only the foreign department of the system, being still its direct 
offspring and logical consequence! 
"The working class first manifested opposition to the bourgeosie when they 
forcibly resisted the introduction of machinery at the very beginning of the 
industrial period" [p. 503].

"The manufacturer is Capital, the operative Labour" (I.e., [p.] 329 [p. 563]). 
There are according to The Daily News (1862) an average of 
roughly 15 deaths by starvation every month in London." 
Let us now see what Mr. Ure  (PHILOSOPHY  OF MANUFACTURES),  the 
Pindar of the factory system, has to tell us about the essential 
character of the mechanical workshop.b 
Vol. I. Difference between the handicraftsman, who employs the 
instrument of labour, and the machinery, which employs the 
worker: 
"It has been said, for example, that the steam engine now drives the 
powerlooms with such velocity as to urge on their attendant weavers at the same 
rapid pace; but that the handweaver, not being subjected to this  restless  agent, can 
throw his shuttle and move his treadles at his convenience" ([pp.] 10-11 [The 
Philosophy of Manufactures..., London 1835, p. 7]). 
It was Sir Robert Peel who made the comment Ure refers to. 
After all, he still thought he was living in the good old days of his 
weaving father, since he went on to say 
"the handloom weavers are mostly small farmers" [Fr. ed., p. 11, Engl., ed., 
p. 7]. 
Ure counters this, on pp. 11 and 12 [pp. 7-8], with the evidence 
of Dr. Carbutt of Manchester: 
"Nothing can be a greater mistake; they live, or rather they just keep life 
together, in the most miserable manner, in the cellars and garrets of the town, 
working sixteen to eighteen hours for the merest pittance." 
But what was it that threw them into the cellars and garrets and 
condemned them to work for 16 to 18 hours a day, if not 
competition from machinery? 
[XX-1247] "This class of operatives, who, though inmates of factories, are not, 
properly speaking, factory workers, being independent of the moving  power,  have been the 
principal source of the obloquy so unsparingly cast on the cotton and other 
factories" ([p.] 13 [pp. 8-9]). 
This group of factory workers is composed in part of the 
menials mentioned earlier (of whom Ure is speaking here), in part 
of the NCO's (OVERLOOKERS) and in part of the engineers and 
mechanics who are associated with the factory. 
What then does the classical FACTORY or mechanical workshop 
consist in? 
a The source for this statement has not been found.— Ed. 
b Marx gives the English title, but quotes in French, from a French edition 
(Philosophie des manufactures..., Paris, 1836). This applies both to longer passages 
and to separate words and phrases. The page numbers he gives refer to the French 
edition. Those in square brackets, supplied by the Editors, refer to the English

Division  of Labour  and Mechanical Workshop  497 
The term "designates  ... the  combined operation  of many orders  of work-people, 
adult  and  young,  in tending with assiduous skill  a system  of productive machines 
continuously impelled  by a  central power...  It excludes"  all factories  "in  which  the 
mechanisms  do not  form  a connected  series,  nor are  dependent  on one  prime mover... 
This title"  (FACTORY)  "in its  strictest sense, involves  the  idea  of a  vast automaton, 
composed  of various mechanical  and  intellectual organs, acting  in uninterrupted  concert  for 
the production  of a  common object,  all of  them being subordinated  to a  self-regulated 
moving force" ([pp.] 19-20 [pp. 13-14]). 
Here are the main characteristics of the mechanical workshop. 
A vast automaton, i.e. a system of connected productive 
mechanisms, receiving their motive power from a self-acting central 
motor. This system of machinery, with its automatic  PRIME MOTOR, 
forms the body, the articulated body of the mechanical workshop. 
The cooperation of various classes of worker, distinguished mainly 
by whether they are adult or not, differences of age and gender. 
These workers themselves appear as merely the intellectual organs 
of the machinery (the machinery does not appear as their organ) 
who are distinguished from the inanimate organs by consciousness, 
and who work "in concert" with the latter, acting, like the inanimate 
machinery, in subordination to its moving force and equally 
"uninterruptedly". 
The raw material has to pass through various metamorphoses, 
to which in the factory system there correspond various machines. 
The main difficulty with the mechanical workshop lay in 
producing 
"the discipline necessary to induce human beings to renounce their desultory 
habits  of work,  and to  identify themselves with  the  unvarying regularity  of the  complex 
automaton  To  devise  and  administer  a successful code  of factory discipline, tied  to 
the necessities  of factory diligence,  was the  Herculean enterprise,  the  noble 
achievement  of Arkwright"  ([p.] 22 [p. 15]). 
Ure continues: 
"Even  at the  present  day,  when  the  system  is perfectly organised,  and its  labour 
lightened  to the  utmost"  (!) "it is  found nearly impossible  to convert persons past  the 
age of puberty, whether drawn from rural  or from handicraft occupations, into 
useful factory hands" ([pp.] 22-23  [p. 15]). 
Here  Ure  admits that, although  no  apprenticeship,  etc., is 
needed,  one  must work  in  these mitigated jails,  as Fourier calls 
them,224 from one's youth  in order  to be  able  to subject oneself  to 
the "discipline"  and to  obey  the  "unvarying regularity  of the 
complex automaton" throughout  the  whole  of the day.  This 
automaton  is the  autocrat here. 
"When Adam Smith wrote  his  immortal elements  of economics, automatic 
machinery being hardly known,  he was  properly  led to  regard  the  division  of labour 
as the  grand principle  of  manufacturing improvement.  In  each branch  of 
manufacture  he saw  that some parts  ... were,  on that principle,  of easy execution 

=====第508页=====
498 Relative Surplus Value 
and [XX-1248] some ... were comparatively difficult; and therefore he concluded 
that to each a workman of appropriate value and cost was naturally assigned" 
([p.] 28 [p. 19]). 
"But what was in Dr. Smith's time a topic of useful illustration, cannot now be 
used without risk of misleading the public mind as to the right principle of 
manufacturing industry. In fact, the division, or rather adaptation of labour to the 
different talents of men, is little thought of in factory employment. On the contrary, 
wherever a  process  requires peculiar dexterity and steadiness of  hand,  it is withdrawn as soon 
as possible  from the cunning workman, who is prone to irregularities of many kinds, 
and it is placed in charge of a peculiar mechanism, so self-regulating, that a child 
may superintend it" [p. 20]. 
//And Ure is still surprised that the workers are not grateful to 
the "peculiar mechanism" which devalues their labour capacity 
and deprives their specialism of any monetary value!// ([p.] 29 
[p. 20]). 
(Ure also speaks of the "menials" of his autocrat or automaton: 
"In those spacious halls the benignant power of steam summons around him his 
myriads of ... menials" ([p.] 26 [p. 18]). 
"The principle of the factory system, then, is to substitute mechanical science for 
hand skill, and the partition of a process into its essential constituents, for the division or 
graduation of labour among artisans. On the handicraft plan, labour was usually the 
most expensive element of a production: materiem superabat opus*; but on the 
automatic plan, skilled labour gets progressively superseded, and will, eventually, be 
replaced by mere overlookers of machines" ([p.] 30 [p. 20]). 
(And the worker is supposed to be grateful for being converted 
like this from a skilled man to a mere overlooker!) 
"By the infirmity of human nature it happens, that the more skilful the workman, 
the more self-willed and intractable he is apt to become, and, of course, the less fit 
a component of a mechanical system" (where he must himself be an automaton) "in 
which, by occasional irregularities, he may do great damage to the whole. The 
grand  object,  therefore, of the modern manufacturer is, through the union of capital 
and science,  to reduce the task of his work-people to the exercise of vigilance and 
dexterity—faculties, when concentred to one process, speedily brought to perfection in the 
young" [pp. 20-21]. 
(Here Mr. Ure admits that the automatic system, like the 
division of labour, fixes the worker's activity on a single point—only 
the undeveloped human being must be broken in from childhood 
onwards to be an "organ of the automaton") ([pp.] 30, 31 
[pp. 20-21]). 
"In the infancy of mechanical engineering, a machine-factory displayed the 
division of labour in manifold gradations: the file, the drill, the lathe, having each its 
different workmen in the order of skill: but the dexterous hands of the filer and driller 
are now superseded by machines, etc., and those of the iron and brass turners by 
the self-acting slide-lathe. Mr. Anthony Strutt, who conducts the mechanical

department  of the  great cotton factories  of Belper  and  Milford,  has so  thoroughly 
departed from  the old  routine  of the  schools, that  he will employ  no man who has 
learned  his craft  by regular apprenticeship"  ([p.] 31 [p. 21]). 
(And indeed the  LAWS  on  APPRENTICESHIP WERE  TO  BE REPEALED  soon 
after the emergence of machinery.) 
The characteristic feature of the automatic system is, instead of 
the gradation and  SPECIFYING  of labour, 
"the equalisation  of labour,  or automatic plan.  On the  gradation  system,  a man  must 
serve  an apprenticeship  of many years before  his  hand  and eye  become skilled enough 
for certain mechanical feats; [XX-1249]  but on the  system  of decomposing  a 
process into  its constituents,  and  embodying each part  in an  automatic machine,  a 
person  of common care  and  capacity  may be  entrusted with  any of the  said 
elementary parts after  a short probation,  and may be  transferred from  one to 
another,  in any  emergency,  at the  discretion  of the  master. Such translations  are 
utterly  at variance with  the old  practice  of the  division  of labour, which fixed  one 
man to shaping  the  head  of a pin, and  another  to sharpening  its point"  (pp.  32-33 
[pp. 21-22]). 
The great  Ure  speaks proudly  of 
"that cramping  of the  faculties, that narrowing  of the  mind, that stunting  of the 
frame, which were ascribed,  and not  unjustly,  by moral writers,  to the  division  of 
labour"  ([p.] 34 [pp.  22-23]). 
"It is in  fact  the  constant  aim and  tendency  of every improvement  in machinery 
to supersede human labour  altogether,  or to  diminish  its cost,  by substituting the industry 
of women  and  children  for  that  of men; or  that  of ordinary labourers,  for trained 
artisans.  In most  of the  water-twist,  or  THROSTLE  cotton  MILLS,  the  spinning  is 
entirely managed  by  females  of sixteen years  and  upwards.  The  effect  of 
substituting  the  self-acting mule  for the  common mule  is to  discharge  the  greater 
part of the men  spinners,  and to  retain adolescents  and  children.  The  proprietor  of 
a factory near Stockport states,  in evidence  to the  commissioners, that  by such 
substitution,  he would save  £50 a  week  in wages,  in consequence  of dispensing with 
nearly  40  male spinners,  at about  25s. of  wages each. This tendency  to employ 
merely children with watchful eyes  and  nimble fingers" 
//these watchful eyes  and  nimble fingers must  BE USED UP IN THE NICK OF 
TIME  FOR THE  POCKETS  OF  THE  MANUFACTURERS// 
"instead  of journeymen  of long experience, shows  how the  scholastic dogma  of the 
division  of labour into degrees  of skill  has  been exploited" 
(the English text has  "EXPLODED"  here: the French translation brings 
out a fine double meaning) 
"by our enlightened manufacturers" ([pp.] 34-35 [p. 23]). 
After Ure has thus correctly described the "tendency" and the 
"constant aim" to drive out labour, to subject the worker to the 
"automaton-autocrat", to reduce the price of labour by substitut­
ing the labour of women and children for that of adults, and 
unskilled for skilled labour, after he has described this as the 
essence of the automatic workshop, he goes on to reproach the 

=====第510页=====
500 Relative Surplus Value 
workers because by their STRIKES they—hasten!—the development 
of this beautiful system. As the system is the best thing for them, 
what could be more intelligent on their part than to "force" its 
development! 
The predominance of women and children in the automatic 
workshop is, to be sure, the best proof of how fundamentally it 
differs from manufacture based on the division of labour, which 
requires "journeymen of long experience". 
Ure says of the application of "physics" in the FACTORY  SYSTEM  that 
one would see there 
"many theorems bearing golden fruit, which had been long barren in college 
ground" ([p.] 37 [p. 24]). 
"A horse can work at its full efficiency only 8 hours out of the 24" ([p.] 43 
[p. 28]). 
(And children [can work] 12?) 
For the steam engine there are no such limits. 
The expense per annum of a machine of 60 horsepower, worked 8 hours every 
day, is £1,565, which is  ABOUT  1/5 of the amount needed to maintain living horses 
for that period [Fr. ed., p. 43, Engl, ed., p. 28]. 
"There are many engines" (steam engines) "made by Bolton and Watt, 40 years 
ago, which have continued in constant work all that time with very slight repairs" 
([p.] 44 [p. 29]). 
[XX-1250] "Steam engines furnish the means not only of their support but of 
their multiplication. They create a vast demand for fuel; and, while they lend their 
powerful arms to drain the pits and to raise the coals, they call into employment 
multitudes of miners, engineers, shipbuilders, and sailors, and cause the construction 
of canals and railways" ([p.] 45 [p. 29]). 
Ure says of the advantages of machines: 
"They enable an operative to turn out a greater quantity of work than he could 
before—'time', 'labour'" (??) "and quality of work remaining constant" ([p.] 46 
[p. 30]). 
This leaves out,  d'abord,  the absolute lengthening of labour time; 
and secondly the greater intensity of labour,  AS FAR AS ITS CONTINUITY  is 
CONCERNED. The statement as it stands in Ure is to be taken as the 
norm in so far as the value of the greater amount of the product 
likewise remains constant, in contrast to the growth in the intensity 
of labour we have considered elsewhere. 
"A steam engine needs no period of repose" ([p.] 43 [p. 28]). 
"The philosophy of manufactures is well displayed in the economy of power" 
([p.] 42 [p. 27]). Firstly economy in the  PRIME MOTOR  ([p.] 42 [p. 27] sqq.). Economy in 
the transmission machinery ([pp.] 55, 56, 57 [pp. 35, 36, 37]). Economy in the working 
machinery ([p.] 58 [p. 37] sqq.). 
"Almost every tool is now more or less automatic, and performs its work more 
cheaply and with greater precision than the hand could possibly do" ([p.] 58 
[p. 37]). 

=====第511页=====
Division  of Labour  and Mechanical Workshop  501 
"The facilities resulting from  the  employment  of self-acting tools have  not  only 
improved  the  accuracy,  and  accelerated  the  construction,  of the  machinery  of a 
factory,  but  have also lowered  its cost  and  increased  its mobility  in a  remarkable 
degree"  ([p.] 62 [p. 40]  sqq.). 
Mr. Ure himself admits that 
"however well-informed  the  mill proprietors  of Great Britain  may be"  they  by no 
means understand  "the  operative part  of  their business  as  clearly  as the 
commercial" 3 ([p.] 66 [p. 42]). 
On p. 67 he speaks of the "ignorance" of the manufacturers AS 
TO THE  "structure of a good machine" [p. 42]. (So that they depend 
on the  "MANAGERS".)  In any case, these  "MANAGERS",  unlike the 
"PROPRIETORS"  of the  FACTORIES,  are, Ure tells us, 
"the soul  of our  factory system"  ([p.] 68 [p. 43]). 
Having told us previously that the factory workers gain a deep 
insight into the nature of the mechanics and physics  EMPLOYED,  Ure 
now admits, with regard to the  PROPRIETORS: 
"It may be  supposed that this species  of education  can be  most easily acquired 
in the  midst  of the  machinery  itself.  But  this  is a  mistake which experience speedily 
proves"  ([p.] 68 [p. 43]). 
He speaks quite correctly of 
"the commercial views  of the  proprietor"  ([p.] 67 [p. 43]) (as  opposed  to 
mechanical views)  ([p.] 67 [p. 42]). 
The automatic machine for dressing warps (see Engels [The 
Condition of the Working-Class in England, p. 511]) was a conse­
quence of  STRIKES: 
"This example affords  an instructive warning  to workmen  to beware  of strikes, 
by proving  how  surely science,  at the call  of capital, will defeat every unjustifiable union 
which  the  labourers  may  form" ([pp.] 63-64  [pp.  40-41]). 
[XX-1251] Any further citations from Part 2 of Ure's book can 
be entered subsequently.225 
Now we want first of all to examine the question of the  REPLACING 
OF LABOUR  by machinery.

NOTES 
1 Having completed the economic manuscript of 1857-58 (see present edition, 
vols 28 and 29), Marx embarked on a substantial economic work which, as he 
planned, was to encompass all aspects of life in capitalist society. The first step 
was the publication, in 1859, of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. 
Part One. In the preface to this work, Marx sets out the plan of his ambitious 
project: "I examine the system of bourgeois economy in the following order: 
capital, landed property, wage-labour; the State, foreign trade, world market... The first 
part of the first book, dealing with Capital, comprises the following chapters: 1. 
The commodity; 2. Money or simple circulation; 3. Capital in general. The 
present part consists of the first two chapters" (see present edition, Vol. 29, 
p. 261). 
The extant correspondence (see present edition, Vol. 40) shows that after 
the publication of Part One Marx intended to start immediately on the second 
part, dealing with capital in general. However, certain circumstances, his 
preoccupation with Herr Vogt among them, prevented him from immediately 
carrying out this intention. Preparatory work (drafting plans, reviewing the 
1857-58 manuscript and excerpts dealing with capital—see present edition, 
Vol. 29—as well as making new excerpts, etc.), continued up to the summer of 
1861,  and in August 1861 Marx began writing. Viewed as the second part of 
A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, the new manuscript originally 
bore the same title, and on the covers of the first two notebooks he wrote the 
subtitle "Third Chapter. Capital in General" (see present edition, Vol. 30, p. 6). 
But soon the size of the manuscript grew considerably and reached 23 
notebooks, 1,472 large pages in all. In the present edition it is published in vols 
30-34.—5 
2 The section on Ravenstone begins on p. XIV—861 of the manuscript (see 
present edition, Vol. 32, p. 392). Preceding it in Notebook XIV and numbered 
"1)" is a section devoted to the anonymous pamphlet The Source and Remedy of 
the National Difficulties.—  7 
3 An analysis of vulgar political economy is to be found in Notebook XV, where 
revenue and its sources are examined (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 449-
541).  On p. XV—935, Marx refers to the "section on the vulgarians" in which 
he will "return" to the polemic between Proudhon and Bastiat mentioned here

only in passing (ibid., p. 526). Further evidence of his intention to write a 
chapter specifically devoted to vulgar political economy is provided by the plan 
for the third part of Capital, which he drew up in January 1863; the eleventh, 
and penultimate, chapter was to have the title "Vulgar Economy" (see this 
volume, p. 347).—7, 255 
4 By the "third chapter" or "third section" Marx means the entire third part of 
the investigation of "capital in general" (see Note 1). The title "Third Chapter. 
Capital and Profit", and also the draft plan of this chapter, are to be found on 
the inside front cover of Notebook XVI (originally Marx called this notebook, 
dated December 1861-January 1862, "Notebook Ultimum"). This title is also 
reproduced on p. XVI—973. A slightly changed and extended version of the 
plan for this section of his study is given by Marx on p. XVIII—1139 (see this 
volume, pp. 346-47). 
In mid-1863, when embarking on a new, third, version of the work which 
was later to become Capital, Marx concluded that the chapters, or sections,in his 
study of "capital in general" would actually represent separate books that 
would be comprised in Capital. From this time on, the third chapter began to 
figure as Book III (later Volume III) of Capital.—7, 346, 380, 478 
5 Marx drew attention to the need for a special examination of the relation between 
surplus value and profit on p. Ill — 98 of the manuscript (see present edition, 
Vol. 30, p. 178).—7 
6 Marx evidently meant the ratio between the rate of profit and the rate of 
surplus value, which is in inverse proportion to the ratio of variable to total 
capital. On the importance of distinguishing between the rate of surplus value 
and the rate of profit see p. Ill—124e of the manuscript (see present edition, 
Vol. 30, p. 229).—7, 77 
7 From p. 1029 on, Notebook XVII continues the text begun in Notebook XV 
(see Note 53).—8 
8 The "Episode" is to be found on pp. XVII— 1038-1065aand XVIII —1068-1074 
(see this volume, pp. 171-222 and 226-38). In the draft plan for the third section 
(the future Volume III) of Capital it has a somewhat different title, namely 
"Reflux Movements of Money in the Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole" 
(see this volume, pp. 346-47).—8 
9 The cover of Notebook XVIII has not survived. The notes given below were 
made on the inside front cover of Notebook XIX of the manuscript of 1861-63. 
Besides the table of contents there are references here to Factories. Returns for 
various years. 
The front cover of Notebook XIX is dated: "Jan. 1863".—  8, 387 
10 In March 1862 Marx interrupted his successive analysis of relative surplus value 
and embarked on a detailed examination of bourgeois theories of surplus value. 
As a result, part of Notebook V was not filled in. In late 1862-early 1863 Marx 
returned to his analysis of the use of machinery in capitalist production and 
made records in notebooks V, XIX and XX, as is testified by his letters to 
Engels of January 24 and 28, 1863 (see present edition, Vol. 41, pp. 446 and 
449-51). Part of Notebook V has therefore been included in this volume in 
accordance with the time it was written. The text on pp. 372-501 of this volume 
thus represents the continuation of subsection "y) Machinery. Utilisation of the 
Forces of Nature and of Science" of section "3) Relative Surplus Value", the 
beginning of which is published in Volume 30 of the present edition.

Notes 507 
Marx did not write the table of contents for Notebook V on the inside front 
cover, which he did for other notebooks of the manuscript of 1861-63 
beginning with Notebook  VI.—8,  372, 489 
11 The notes given below were made on the inside front cover of Notebook XX of 
the manuscript of 1861-63. 
On the front cover of Notebook XX Marx wrote: "März. April, Mai. 1863", 
the last two months being inserted in retrospect.—8 
12 In the economic manuscript of 1857-58 (see present edition, Vol. 28), and also 
in notebooks I, II and XI of the present manuscript (see present edition, 
vols 30 and 31), Marx described mercantile and money-dealing capitals as being, 
on the one hand, the first historical forms of capital and, on the other hand, 
derivative forms of capital in bourgeois society. Marx drew attention to the need to 
go into greater detail on the role of trade in the development of capitalist 
production on p. II—71 of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 30, 
p. 136).—9 
13 The text on pp. 9-25 of this volume reproduces in part and with some alterations a 
number of passages from Marx's economic manuscript of 1857-58 (see present 
edition, Vol. 29, pp. 226-36).-—9 
14 The term "auxiliary capital" was used by Richard Jones, who, in Marx's words, 
understood it to mean "the part of constant capital which is not made up of 
raw material" (see this volume, p. 357). Cf. p. V—196 of the manuscript, 
where Marx also uses the said term (present edition, Vol. 30, p. 327).—9 
15 Above, on p. XV—939 of the manuscript, Marx writes on this score: "The 
usurer in all pre-capitalist modes of production has a revolutionary impact only 
in the political sense, in that he destroys and wrecks the forms of property 
whose constant reproduction in the same form constitutes the stable basis of the 
political structure" (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 535).—10 
16 Page XV—941 of the manuscript has the note, "England. 17th century. The 
polemics are no longer directed against usury as such, but against the amount 
of interest" (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 537).—11 
17 "Profit upon expropriation" (or "profit upon alienation") is a term which was 
used in writings on political economy before Marx. On p. VI—221 he writes 
that "profit upon alienation ... arises ... from the goods being sold above 
their value" (see present edition, Vol. 30, p.  351).—11,  35, 67, 241, 351 
18 There follows the end of the sentence crossed out by Marx: "before it takes on 
its other functions, before capitalist production, and therefore before capital 
itself comes to be the all-dominant relation of production, before its 
fundamental form is developed in which it constitutes the basis of modern 
society".—12 
19 Cf. Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft of 1857-58) 
(present edition, Vol. 29, p. 233) and also Capital, Vol. Ill, chapters XX and 
XXXVI (present edition, Vol. 37).—12, 20 
20 In the original there follows the sentence crossed out by Marx: "What he 
receives for his money therefore depends neither on its value nor on the value 
of the commodities, since the general measure of valorisation and thus profit, the 
average rate of profit, come into being only on the foundation of capitalist 
production  itself.  " —12

21 The dialectics of alienation and appropriation in the process by which the 
bourgeois mode of production emerges and develops were discussed in detail 
by Marx back in Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft of 
1857-58) notably in the section headed "Forms Preceding Capitalist Produc­
tion" (see present edition, Vol. 28, pp. 399-439).—13 
22 Cf. the exposition below on pp. 17-18 and the corresponding passages in 
Capital, Vol. Ill, Chapter XXXVI (present edition, Vol. 37).—17 
23 In the manuscript, the word "principalities" (Provinzen) was crossed out and 
"lands"  (Ländern) written above it. On the exploitation of peasants in the 
"Romanian principalities" see Capital, Vol. I, Chapter X (present edition, 
Vol. 35).—17 
24 Here Marx quotes from Recherches sur la nature et les causes de la richesse des 
nations, Paris, 1802, Garnier's translation of Adam Smith's work. Marx made 
excerpts from it in Paris in the spring of 1844. In the present volume all 
quotations from Garnier's translation are given according to the English 
edition (A. Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
by J. R. MacCulloch. In four volumes. Edinburgh, London, 1828), with the 
pages indicated in brackets, and Marx's wording respected. Marx widely used 
the 1828 edition when working on the manuscript of 1861-63.—19 
25 Marx apparently had in mind this passage when he mentioned Steuart on 
p. IV—174 of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 30, p. 298).—20 
26 On the term "free hands" coined by James Steuart see present edition, Vol. 28, 
p. 395, Vol. 30, pp. 193, 295, Vol. 32, p. 180, and also Capital, Vol. Ill, 
Chapter XLVII (present edition, Vol. 37).—21 
27 Marx is not quite accurate here. Thomas Manley was the author not of the tract 
Interest of Money Mistaken, published anonymously in London in 1668, but of 
another tract which appeared in London in 1669, under the heading Usury at 6 
per cent Examined and Found Unjustly Charged by Sir Thos. Culpeper and J. C. 
Since below Marx quotes Child from the French edition indicated, which 
includes several of his works, the present volume has the titles and page 
numbers of the English originals in square brackets.—22 
28 Below in the original mistakes were made when converting pence into 
shillings.—23 
29 There follows an incomplete sentence which concludes p. 950b: "If wages fell 
to V3, say from 2/5s...."—24 
30 The magnitude 2/5, or 40 per cent, does not reflect the ratio between the 
amount of profit and the price of the product, but the approximate ratio 
between the profit and the outlay on the product's manufacture. In actual fact the 
former ratio is 4/15, or  262/3  per cent.—26 
31 The price of the product in this case is the same as in II, but not in I a).—26 
32 Marx is referring to the value added by living labour.—29, 128 
33 Marx is referring to case I a).—30 
34 The reference is to the value added by living labour, both paid and 
unpaid.— 30 
35 In the table below, several figures which Marx gives twice are reproduced only 
once.—  30

36 Page XV — 956 is the direct continuation of page XV—953, and page XV—954 is 
the direct continuation of page XV—956.—30, 33 
37 Marx means the value of labour power, or of labour capacity. He deliberately 
drew a distinction between labour and labour power (labour capacity) back in 
the economic manuscript of 1857-58 (see present edition, vols 28 and 29). 
However, in this manuscript, which was not intended for publication, the term 
"value of labour" is often used for the sake of brevity in the sense of "value of 
labour capacity".—32 
38 Up to here, according to Marx's supposition, 100s. represented 5 M and not 
10 M, so that 50s. represent not 5 M, but 2V2 M.—33 
39 See D. Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy, and Taxation, London, 
1821,  chapters I, V, VI, and XXI. This thesis of Ricardo's is examined by Marx 
in greater detail in notebooks XII and XIII of the manuscript (see present 
edition, vols 31 and 32).—33 
40 In the previous exposition Marx assumed throughout that £100 commanded 5 
men.—34 
41 Marx examines case III.—35 
42 Page 957 is the direct continuation of page 955.—36 
43 In this manuscript Marx often refers to "wage labour" or "labour" pure and 
simple when he means hired labour power (see also Note 36).—39, 50, 175, 176, 
179, 198, 204, 206, 234, 262 
44 The concept "capital in general" is central to the economic manuscript of 
1857-58 (see present edition, vols 28 and 29) and is used repeatedly in Marx's 
correspondence (see present edition, Vol. 40, pp. 287, 298-303). On the whole, 
Marx viewed this manuscript as representing a stage in his efforts to work out the 
substance of the said concept (see Note 1).—41 
45 Cf. Matthew 6:19: "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where 
moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal."—44 
46 These questions are examined in detail by Marx in Capital, Volume III, Chapter 
XXXV (see present edition, Vol. 37).—46 
47 Marx means the case when the cotton manufacturer's capital amounts to £1,000 
and turns over four times a year.—52 
48 In the manuscript the annual production of each manufacturer is given as 
40,000 yards. This implies that their capitals turn over several times a year, 
whereas all the other figures in this example show that each capital turns over 
just once a year, producing 4,000 yards. If we assume that the manufacturer's 
capital (£900) turns over four times a year, in a year it will produce 36,000 
yards.  In this case each merchant could buy and sell the commodities produced 
by four manufacturers.—53

XIV—788-789 of the manuscript of 1861-63 (see present edition, Vol. 31,

510 Notes 
53 This is the end of Notebook XV of the manuscript of 1861-63. There follows a 
note by Marx: "Continued in Notebook XVII." The single front cover of 
notebooks XVII and XVIII (p. 1066) carries the note: "Beginning on page 1029 
continuation of Notebook XV" (see also Note 127).—68 
54 Chapter, or Section, II of Marx's work was to have been devoted to examining 
the circulation process of capital (see the draft plan of 1861, Section II, 
"Circulation Process of Capital", present edition, Vol. 29, pp. 514-16). The 
content of this section was largely expounded back in Outlines of the Critique 
of Political Economy (Rough Draft of 1857-58) (see present edition, Vol. 28, 
pp. 329-537, Vol. 29, pp. 7-128).—69, 89 
55 On the place accorded to an examination of landed property in the plan for 
Marx's economic studies see Note 1 and also present edition, Vol. 40, 
p. 270.—69 
56 Marx is referring to the proposition: "Profits, indeed, imply proportions; and 
the rate of profits, had always justly been estimated by a per-centage upon the 
value of the advances" (Th. R. Malthus, Definitions in Political Economy..., 
London, 1827, p. 30).—70, 100 
57 In his examination of usury in De republica (Politico), I, 8-10, Aristotle 
concludes that the generation of money by money, or interest, is the sphere of 
acquisition most offensive to human nature. Marx refers to this statement by 
Aristotle in the original text of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy 
(see present edition, Vol. 29, p. 488) and also in Capital, Volume I, Chapter V 
(see present edition, Vol. 35).—71 
58 Marx is referring to the following statement: "Wealth like labour and through 
labour bears fruit annually... This fruit is the revenue flowing out of capital" 
(J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi, Nouveaux principes d'économie politique, Vol. I, 
Paris,  1827, pp. 81-82). He subsequently quoted it in Capital, Volume I, 
Chapter XXIII (see present edition, Vol. 35).—71 
59 Marx wrote about the greed for alien labour time, which determines the 
behaviour of the capitalist, and about other questions connected with this when 
he examined absolute surplus value in Notebook III of this manuscript (see 
present edition, Vol. 30).— 71 
60 Marx criticised the erroneous arguments on interest and compound interest in 
Richard Price's works An Appeal to the Public..., London, 1772, and Observations 
on Reversionary Payments..., London, 1772, and also William Pitt's fantasy 
engendered by Price's ideas, back in the manuscript of 1857-58 (see present 
edition, Vol. 29, pp. 218-19). When examining the question of compound 
interest on p. XIV—853 of the manuscript he noted: "We shall return to 
Price's fantasy in the section on revenue and its sources" (see present edition, 
Vol. 32, p. 376). However, in Notebook XV, which contains a summary of the 
views of vulgar bourgeois political economists on revenue and its sources (see 
ibid.) there is no mention of "Price's fantasy". Marx did not resume his 
criticism of Price on this question until p. XVIII—1066 of the manuscript of 
1861-63 (see this volume, pp. 222-24). 
Subsequently a critical analysis of Price's views was given in Capital, Vol. Ill, 
Chapter XXIV (see present edition, Vol.  37).—71,  222 
61 In Notebook XV of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 531-40)

62 The reference is to A. R. J. Turgot, Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution 
des richesses.  In Oeuvres..., Vol. I, Paris, 1844, pp. 39 and 57. For a description 
of Turgot's views on the profit yielded by capital see this manuscript, 
pp. VI—233 and XV—906 (present edition, Vol. 30, p. 367, Vol. 32,

63 Cf. the draft plan for the section on the production process of capital, 
p. XVIII—1140 of the manuscript (see this volume, p. 347),where under point 
"6) Reconversion of surplus value into capital..." Marx notes the need to 
examine Wakefield's theory of colonisation. He later devoted Chapter XXXIII 
of Volume I of Capital to an analysis of the theory (see present edition, 
Vol. 35).—72 
64 Ramsay's views are examined in detail in notebooks I and III of the manuscript 
of 1861-63 (see present edition, Vol. 30), those of Malthus in Notebook III (ibid., 
Vol. 32), of Senior in notebooks III and XX (ibid., vols 30, 34) and of Torrens in 
notebooks I and XIV (ibid., vols 30, 32).—73 
65 On Torrens see Note 64.— 74 
66 In Notebook III of this manuscript Marx examined Senior's views as an 
"example illustrating the political economists' failure to understand surplus 
labour and surplus value" (see present edition, Vol. 30, pp. 179, 199-203).—74 
67 When working on this manuscript, Marx was guided in his study of capital by 
the plan he had devised when writing the manuscript of 1857-58 and which he 
set out in a letter to Engels of April 2, 1858: "Capital falls into 4 sections, 
a) Capital en general... b) Competition, or the interaction of many capitals, c) Credit, 
where capital, as against individual capitals, is shown to be a universal element, 
d) Share capital as the most perfected form (turning into communism) together 
with all its contradictions" (see present edition, Vol. 40, p. 298).—75, 88, 94, 101, 
111, 113, 170, 179, 184, 212, 280 
68 Marx deals with Malthus' polemic against Ricardo on this issue on pp. XIII — 
761-762 of the manuscript of 1861-63 (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 222-
25).—76 
89 Marx traced the main directions in which Ricardo's theory of value was 
vulgarised in the works of James Mill and MacCulloch in Notebook XIV of the 
manuscript; see especially pp. XIV—844-848 (present edition, Vol. 32, 
pp. 359-67).—76 
70 Marx deals with Say's views on value on pp. XIV—847-850 of the manuscript 
(see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 365-69).—76 
71 In the draft plan for the chapter "Capital and Profit" which Marx drew up on 
p. XVIII —1139, the eleventh (penultimate) item reads "Vulgar economy" (see 
this volume, p. 347).—76 
72 Marx is referring to a notebook which is not extant and in which between 1844 
and 1847 he made excerpts from Antoine Cherbuliez's work Richesse ou 
pauvreté, Paris, 1841 (see also Note 201). Marx deals with Cherbuliez's views on 
this question on pp. XVIII—1106-1112 (see this volume, pp. 292-304).—78 
73 Marx notes the need for a detailed analysis of the costs of production on 
p. II—88 of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 30, p. 163).—-78

74 Marx is referring to pp. I—1-13 of the manuscript of 1861-63 (see present 
edition, Vol. 30, pp. 9-32).—78 
75 Say's and Jones' views on this question were not discussed in the manuscript; 
Torrens' position is analysed on pp. XIII — 783-788 (see present edition, 
Vol. 32, pp. 262-70).—82 
76 The reference is possibly to the propositions advanced in the works by 
J. B. Say, Traité d'économie politique..., 4th edition, Vol. 2, Paris, 1819, pp. 491 
and 507-08, and H. Storch, Cours d'économie politique, Vol. 2, St. Petersburg, 
1815,  pp. 252-60.—82 
77 In all probability, Marx was referring to what follows under point d) when he 
wrote on p. II—90: "We have investigated the changes in constant capital 
elsewhere (in dealing with profit)" (see present edition, Vol. 30, p. 165). See 
also p. II—93 (present edition, Vol. 30, pp. 168-69). Evidently, the final pages 
of Notebook II were filled in by Marx after he had completed Notebook XVI, 
which is dated December 1861-January 1862.—84 
78 The part of the sentence enclosed in square brackets was crossed out by Marx, 
probably by mistake.— 88 
79 The example to which Marx refers is given on p. V—205 of the manuscript of 
1861-63 (see present edition, Vol. 30, p. 339).—89 
80 The original has "6a", which is evidently a mistake.—91 
81 In this connection Marx referred to William Blake's Observations on the Effects 
Produced by the Expenditure of Government... also on p. XII—688 of the 
manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 93). He reproduced the pertinent 
passages from the said work back in the manuscript of 1857-58 (see present 
edition, Vol. 29, pp. 168-69).—92 
82 On p. XI—555 of the manuscript Marx quoted a number of pages from Adam 
Smith's Inquiry... (according to the French edition, Recherches sur la nature et les 
causes de la richesse des nations, Vol. I, Paris, 1802) dealing with the causes of the 
fall in the rate of profit; he went into greater detail abour Smith's position on 
this issue on pp. XIII—673, 693 (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp.  72-73, 
101-02).—92 
83 Cf. this statement by Marx on competition and its reflection in bourgeois 
political economy with the similar passage on p. IV—21 of the manuscript of 
1857-58 (present edition, Vol. 28, pp. 340-41).—102 
84 Marx comments on this statement by Smith on p. VI—260 of the manuscript 
of 1861-63 (see present edition, Vol. 30, pp. 395-96).—103 
85 The text on p. 999 is the direct continuation of that on p. 994. The sheet which 
makes up pp. 995-998 (they are twice the size of the other pages in Notebook XVI) 
was evidently inserted into the notebook at a later date, following which Marx 
numbered all the pages. The text on the inserted pages is published immediately 
before the text marked in the margins as "Continuation of the last 
page of the inserted sheet", and begins on p. XVI —1009 (see this volume, 
p. 129).—103 
86 Marx deals in detail with the views of Malthus, Torrens and Ramsay on the said 
questions on pp. XIII—753-758, 760-764, XIV—782-788, and XVIII—1087-
1090,  of the manuscript respectively (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 209-18,

88 Marx gives the pertinent excerpt from Dombasle's work Annales agricoles..., 
Vol. 4, Paris, 1828, on p. X—449 of the manuscript (see present edition, 
Vol. 31, pp. 259-60).—104 
89 In the original, instead of Jones, Marx—apparently by mistake—names here 
the English agricultural chemist James Johnston whom he subsequently quotes 
in chapters XXXVII and XXXIX of Volume III of Capital. In Chapter XLV he 
refers to Dombasle and Jones in connection with the progress of capitalist 
agriculture and the growth in the organic composition of capital deriving from 
it (see present edition, Vol. 37). 
Marx analyses in detail Richard Jones' theory of rent on pp. XVIII  —1121-
1130 of the manuscript (see this volume, pp. 320-32).—104 
90 The reference is to J. Fullarton, On the Regulation of Currencies..., London, 
1844,  pp. 161-66. Marx examines Fullarton's views on crises in the manuscript 
of 1857-58 and on p. XIII—707 of the manuscript of 1861-63 (see present 
edition, Vol. 29, p. 225, Vol. 32, p. 129).—105, 112 
91 Marx is referring to the section dealing with relative surplus value, which 
constitutes part of Notebook III and notebooks IV and V of the economic 
manuscript of 1861-63 (see present edition, Vol. 30).—107 
92 According to the example given, the expenditure of living labour in India 
equals 400+80=480. The proportion of surplus labour time in the total labour 
time equals 80/480=I/6l this therefore represents the possible proportion of the 
non-productive population. 
The expenditure of living labour in England is equal to 100+50=150. The 
proportion of surplus labour time, and thus the possible proportion of the 
non-productive population, is 50/i5o =  1/3, °r twice as much as in India.—107 
93 Cf. the text below on pp. 108-10 with the proposition formulated by Marx on 
pp. IV—138-139 (present edition, Vol. 30, p. 247) on the proportion in which a 
reduction of necessary labour time causes an increase in surplus labour time 
and its tendencies towards change (see present edition, Vol. 30, Note 185).— 
108 
94 In his manuscript of 1857-58 Marx quoted the pertinent passages from 
Sismondi as found in Nouveaux principes d'économie politique..., Vol. 1, Paris, 
1827,  pp. 94, 95, 97-98 (see present edition, Vol. 29, pp. 35-36).—108

96 Marx analyses Smith's views on the ratio of profit to wages on pp. XI—555-557 
(see present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 449-52).—108 
97 Marx analyses Ricardo's views on the ratio of wages to profit in notebooks XII 
and XIII, pp. 661-694 (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 51-103).—108 
98 Marx criticised Carey's position on this question back in the manuscript of 
1857-58,  pp. Ill—2, IV—1, VI—1, VI—27, VII—18 (see present edition, 
Vol. 28, pp. 6-8, 296-98, 478, Vol. 29, pp. 29, 138-39).—109

107 Here and below Marx assumes that the annual wear and tear of the machinery 
amounts to 50, not to 37, thalers. Then, the not-consumed part of the 
advanced capital is equal at the end of the first year to 370—50=320 (not 
370-37=333), and neither is it 300 thalers, as Marx assumes here.—126 
108 what follows in the manuscript is crossed out: "or 80 on 200. The total capital 
advanced — 280, of which 80 go on wages. Previously 200 went on constant 
capital and 400 on wages—600 in total. In the first case, the proportion of 
capital expended on labour to the total capital is 80/2so- In  tne second, 400/600-
In the first [case]—2/7, in the second—2/3; consequently, not as it appeared 
originally, 2/15 in the first case and 2/3 in the second; then the difference was 
between 6/i5 and  30/45,  or 5 times greater in the second case than in the first; 
[in actual fact] in the second [the change is] from 2/y to 2/3, or from 6/2i to 
14/21, i.e. only 2>/3 times greater [than in the  first].

109 Marx means section "3) Relative Surplus Value" of Part I, "The Produc­
tion Process of Capital" (see present edition, Vol. 30, pp. 233-346).—128 
110 In the margins of p. XVI —  998,  Marx made the following addition, which has 
only survived in part and cannot therefore be placed with certainty at a definite 
point in the text: "... that the sum of surplus value not only does not fall, but 
rises [...] to the actual rate [of surplus value] depends on the number of 
workers employed, that with the use of machinery, due to the action of the laws 
inherent in machine production, the more productive application [...], the 
better division and combination of labour due to fixed capital, grows."—129 
111 With the aid of the new means of production, the workers produce in one hour 
of labour not 8/i0 of a thaler, as previously, but 3/5 greater than this amount, 
i.e. 8/io+3/äx8/io= l'/25 thalers; in 6 hours of labour, therefore, 7"/ 25 thalers, 
which is a little different from the amount of 8 thalers given by Marx.—130

136 Sphere I in the present manuscript refers to the production of means of 
subsistence (objects of consumption), and sphere II to the production of means 
of production, or elements of constant capital. Accordingly, the capitalists in 
sphere I are denoted as class I and those in sphere II as class II. Later, in 
Volume II of Capital (see present edition, Vol. 36), Engels, basing himself on 
the final draft of Volume II, denoted the production of means of production 
as sphere I and the production of means of subsistence as sphere II.— 200 
137 In his previous calculations, Marx assumed that the ratio of variable to constant 
capital in this sphere was 1:5, and not 1:6, as he now assumes.—201

142 The currency principle—one of the varieties of the quantitative theory of

144 There follows an incomplete calculation which Marx crossed out with three 
vertical lines: "And this is the entire capital he needs in this LINE during the year. 
10% of 510 makes £51 a year and £10'/5 for '/j year. For £510 the  SHOP  therefore 
receives goods to the tune of £520  V5. And for 1,020 it receives goods to the tune 
of 1,040 2/5. With this sum it makes purchases from the WHOLESALER every fifth of 
a year. For the 20  SHOPKEEPERS  which exist for every  WHOLESALE DEALER  this makes 
20x£520'/5=£10,404, and for 100  SHOPKEEPERS  per year >/5 year=52,020. This 
means that for 5/5, or 1 year, = ."—221 
145 page 1Q66 opens Notebook XVIII, which Marx filled in in January 1863.—222 
146 In order to prevent a growth in the national debt, William Pitt the Younger, 
then British Prime Minister, introduced in 1786 a sinking fund, i.e., a scheme 
whereby a certain proportion of public revenues was used every year to 
purchase state promissory notes. However, the war with France (1793-1802) 
was accompanied by a sharp increase in the national debt. The imbalance 
between revenues and expenditure led first to a limit on the issue of banknotes, 
and in 1797 to the enactment of a law relieving the Bank of England of the 
obligation to accept banknotes. Marx dealt in detail with the laws on the sinking 
fund enacted under Pitt in the article "Mr. Disraeli's Budget" published in the 
New-York Daily Tribune, No. 5318, May 7, 1858 (see present edition, 
Vol. 15, pp. 512-14).—222 
147 The reference is to Pitt's speech of February 17, 1792. It was reproduced in 
part in James Maitland Lauderdale's book Recherches sur la nature et l'origine de 
la richesse publique..., Paris, 1808, pp. 176-79, which Marx quotes below.— 223 
148 The reference is to Lauderdale's book from which Marx familiarised himself 
with Pitt's speech of February 17, 1792 (see Note 147).—223 
149 Marx planned to devote one of the books of his economic work specifically to 
foreign trade (see Note 1).—229 
150 Ricardo advanced this hypothesis in chapters XIII and XXVIII of his book On 
the Principles of Political Economy, and Taxation. Here Marx, too, adheres to this 
hypothesis (see, for example, this volume, p. 193), considering it to be 
correct (see its substantiation in Capital, Volume II, Chapter XX, point XII, 
"The Reproduction of the Money Material"—present edition, Vol. 36). At the 
same time, Marx noted Ricardo's extreme inconsistency on this issue back in his 
work A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One (see present 
edition, Vol. 29, pp. 401-02).—231 
151 In the manuscript of 1861-63 Marx uses the term "cost price" ("Kostenpreis" 
or "Kostpreis") in three different meanings: 1) in the sense of the price of 
production, as here; 2) in the sense of the "immanent cost of production" of 
the commodity, which is identical to the value of the commodity (see present 
edition, Vol. 30, p. 401); and 3) in the sense of the cost of production.—232

from the original. Marx quotes Newman according to notebooks XVI and XVII 
of excerpts compiled in London in 1851-52.—239 
153 In this manuscript Marx holds that the "real movement of capital" (it can be 
observed in competition, credit, share capital and other more concrete forms of 
interaction between numerous capitals) should be examined following a 
clarification of what is meant by the general nature of capital as expressed by 
the concept "capital in general" (see also notes 1 and 44).—242

155 -phe American Civil War (1861-65) led, among other things, to a blockade of 
US cotton exports to Britain, bringing about a crisis in the country's textile 
industry. Many factories were closed down and their workers sacked. The price 
of cotton rose, bringing with it unbridled speculation on the Liverpool cotton 
market. Marx later returned to this in Capital, Volume III, Chapter VI, point 
III (see present edition, Vol. 37).—249 
156 Tne  text  on pp XVIII—1084-1157 belongs mainly to the Theories of Surplus 
Value (see present edition, vols 30-32).—253 
157 The passages from Hodgskin's work which Marx gives below are presented 
partly in a summarised form according to Notebook IX of excerpts compiled in 
London in 1851.—253 
158 Below Marx partly quotes and partly interprets the pertinent passages from 
Hodgskin's anonymously published work Labour Defended..., London, 1825, 
according to Notebook XI of excerpts compiled in London in 1851.—253 
159 Marx is referring to Notebook IX of excerpts which he compiled in London in 
1851.  Page 47 of this notebook carries the pertinent excerpts from pp. 252-56 
of Hodgskin's book Popular Political Economy.—255 
160 Here Marx returns to an analysis of Ramsay's thesis which he criticised earlier, 
on pp. II—72-74 of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 30, pp. 137-42). 
The passages from Ramsay below are given by Marx partly in a summarised 
form according to Notebook IX of excerpts compiled in London in 1851.—256 
161 The term "average price" (Durchschnittspreis) is used here by Marx in the 
sense of price of production, i.e., the costs of production plus average profit, 
since he is referring to the "average market price over a long period, or the 
central point towards which the market price gravitates", as he explains on 
p. XII—605 (present edition, Vol. 31, p. 530). Marx first used this term on 
p. VI—264 (ibid., Vol. 30, p. 400). In the present manuscript, the said term is 
used as a synonym for the terms "cost price" and "price of production". See also 
Note 151.—259 
162 Marx expands on Mill's example of the "wine in the cellar" on p. VIII—341 
and also on pp. XIV—792, 845 of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 31, 
pp. 70-71,  Vol. 32, pp. 277, 362).—259 
163 The reference is to the "exceptions" formulated by Ricardo on the basis of 
the law which stipulates that value is determined by labour time. Marx goes 
into greater detail on this on pp. XI—528-542 and also pp. XIV— 
782-783 of the manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 400-26, Vol. 32, 
pp. 258-62).—261

and Profit", which he began in Notebook XVI and in point 2 of which he 
proposed to discuss the question of the "transformation of values into prices of 
production"— cf. his draft plan on p. XVIII—1139 (this volume, p. 346). 
Subsequently this question was examined in Capital, Volume III, chapters 
VIII-XII (see present edition, Vol. 37).—261 
165 In the original calculation it was assumed that in the second case the cost of 
production of instruments of labour and labour capacity would be reckoned 
against the halved value of a quarter of corn resulting from the doubling in the 
size of the harvest. Now Marx points out that this fall in value occurred only in 
the autumn of the second year, whilst up to that autumn the value of a quarter 
was twice as high. Thus, whilst in the original calculation the costs of. 
production in the second case amount to 20c+40c+40u = 100 quarters, it now 
turns out that they are expressed by the first sum, i.e., the sum in the first case: 
20c + 20c+20u = 60 quarters. Since the harvest in the second case amounts to 
200 quarters, the share of profit equals 140 quarters.—267 
166 Marx is apparently referring to the conversion of part of profit and part of 
capital into rent, which he examined on pp. XIII—684-687, when analysing 
Ricardo's theory of profit (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 87-92).—272 
167 On p. Ill—126 of the manuscript, Marx, examining the influence of a rise in 
labour productivity on a fall in the value of constant and variable capital, 
noted: "see Ramsay" (see present edition, Vol. 30, p. 236).—273 
168 On workers' cooperative factories in Britain see also p. XV—919 of the 
manuscript (present edition, Vol. 32, p. 497).—280 
169 xhe summary of contents for the Theories of Surplus Value written on the inside 
front cover of Notebook XIV of the manuscript includes point "n) Cherbuliez" 
(see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 8). Marx intended to examine Sismondi's views, 
not in the Theories of Surplus Value, but in the subsequent part of his work 
where he planned to analyse the "real movement of capital (competition and 
credit)"  (ibid., p. 245). See also Note 67.-285 
170 In the manuscript Marx crossed out the following here: "Although now, in view of 
the fivefold turnover, this individual capitalist has to lay out only £2,500 on 
cotton, the capital spent on cotton is, if we consider the overall product, 5 times 
that contained in labour."—290 
171 Cherbuliez gave the name "commercial profit" (profit mercantile) to the profit 
of the individual capitalist.—292 
172 Apart from the extraction of minerals, the production of timber, fishing and 
hunting, Cherbuliez included among the "extractive industries (industries 
extractives) all types of farming which produce agricultural raw materials.— 292 
173 What Marx means when he refers to the need to "reduce the first proposition 
to its correct formulation" is that the original lacks the word "value" (see also 
next page) given here in italics, since Cherbuliez makes no distinction 
between the value of products and their material form, or use value.— 
294 
174 Marx is referring to the examination of mercantile capital in notebooks XV and 
XVII of the manuscript, notably pp. 964 and 1030 (see this volume, pp. 48-50, 
155-57).—317 
175 Marx is summarising James Mill's arguments as contained in Elements of Political 
Economy, London, 1821, Chapter 4, Section 5, "Taxes on Rent".—319

176 Cherbuliez describes the inequality between the rich and the poor who depend 
on them as the first result of the present distribution of wealth.—320 
177 The reference is to the anonymous review of this book by Jones published in 
the issue of August-September 1831 (Vol. LIV), pp. 84-99.—320 
1,8 Ryot—an Indian peasant. Jones applies this term to the peasants in India and 
other Asian countries who paid rent—a tax in kind—to the sovereign, who was 
the supreme owner of all the land.— 321 
179 The cottiers—a category of the rural population consisting of poor or landless 
peasants. In Ireland, the cottiers rented small plots of land and cottages from 
the landlords or real estate agents on extremely onerous terms. Their position 
resembled that of farmhands.—322 
180 when examining Ricardo's views on the question of rent, Marx referred to this 
fact on pp. XI—492, 504, as well as on p. XII—605 of the manuscript (see 
present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 338-39, 358-60, 529-30).—323

d'économie politique.... Vol. I, Paris, 1827, pp. 300-13; Th. Hopkins, Economical 
Enquiries..., London, 1822, p. 11 et seq. and p. 31 et seq.; idem., On Rent of

522; XII—644 (present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 365-68, 387, Vol. 32, p. 22).—324 
182 Marx is referring to Roscher's book System der Volkswirthschaft, Vol. 1: Die 
Grundlagen der Nationalökonomie, Stuttgart and Augsburg, 1858, p. 385, where 
Roscher, discussing the division of profit into profit of enterprise and interest, 
refers to An Outline... by Senior, who, along with George Read, was among the 
first to draw attention to this fact. In Notebook VII of excerpts compiled in 
London in 1859-63, p. 229, Marx remarks that this division was discernible 
back in the anonymous pamphlet An Inquiry into those Principles, respecting the 
Nature of Demand and the Necessity of Consumption, London, 1821, pp.  52-53,  and 
also in Thomas Hopkins' Economical Enquiries Relative to the Laws Which Regulate 
Rent, Profit, Wages, and the Value of Money, London, 1822, pp. 43-44.—333 
183 what Jones calls the "labour fund" figures in Malthus as "funds for the 
maintenance of labour". This term was used repeatedly in the first edition of 
Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population..., London, 1798, pp. 303, 305, 306, 
307, 312, 313, et seq. It also occurs in his Principles of Political Economy...—333 
184 In his Text-book of Lectures on the Political Economy of Nations, Hertford, 1852, 
p. 71, Jones recalls that the Earl of Warwick, the "king-maker", alone fed daily, 
in his various castles, 40,000 men.—335 
185 Marx made  a detailed conspectus  of this work  by Jones  in Notebook  VII of 
excerpts compiled in London in 1859-63, pp. 119-23, from where the 
quotations below are taken.— 337 
186 xhe  supporters  of this viewpoint included Nassau William Senior (Principes 
fondamentaux de l'économie politique..., Paris, 1836, pp. 342-43); Alonzo Potter 
(Political Economy, New York, 1841, p. 133); Gustave de Molinari (Etudes 
économiques, Paris, 1846, p. 36) and other economists.—338 
187 Marx discusses revenue and its sources on pp. XV—891-944 of the manuscript 
(see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 449-541). This "Episode", as Marx describes 
it on the inside front cover of Notebook XIV, is a supplement to the main text

of the Theories of Surplus Value. It may be seen from the plan for the third 
section (see Note 4) of Capital drawn up on p. XVIII—1139 that he intended 
it to be subsequently included as point 9 in this third chapter (see this volume, 
p. 346).—340 
188 Only Jones was a clergyman.—345 
189 see article "Connection between the Rate of Interest and the Abundance or 
Scarcity of the Precious Metals" in the indicated issue of The Economist. This

the work of 150. Now 280,000 men are supposed to be employed in it, whereas 
half a century ago 42,000,000 were required."—374

522 Notes 
203 Marx is referring to the following passage from Ravenstone's book Thoughts on 
the Funding System, and Its Effects, London, 1824, p. 45: "Machinery can seldom 
be applied with success to abridge the labours of an individual; more time 
would be lost in its construction than could be saved by its application. It is only 
really useful when it acts on great masses, when a single machine can assist the 
labours of thousands." Marx also quotes this passage in the manuscript of 
1857-58 (see present edition, Vol. 28, p. 325). See Note 2.—381 
204 Marx came to this conclusion as a result of analysing the half-yearly reports of 
the English factory inspectors. See, for example, Reports of the Inspectors of 
Factories ... for the Half Year ending 31st October 1859, London, 1860, pp. 47-48, 
52. See also present edition, Vol. 30, pp. 170, 224, Vol. 20, p. 10.—386 
205 Excerpts on this subject are to be found in Notebook VII (p. 193), compiled in 
London in 1859-63, in which Marx copied out passages from the Irish Census 
for 1861. The census indicated that, between 1851 and 1861,  1,230,986 
Irishmen emigrated. This was partly due to the famine of 1846-47 caused by the 
potato blight, which claimed a million lives. In 1861 the total population of Ireland 
was 5,764,543, having fallen by 787,842 since 1851.—387 
206 See Marx's letter to Engels of January 28, 1863 (present edition, Vol. 41, 
pp. 449-51). This letter sets out in generalised form what Marx wrote on the 
first thirty pages of Notebook XIX. The most probable direct reason for this 
description of the essential differences between a tool and a machine was his 
study of Richard Jones' views.—387 
207 Marx is most likely referring to the statements made by Charles Hutton in his 
book A Course of Mathematics, London, 1841, p. 810, and also by Francis Wayland 
in The Elements of Political Economy, Boston, 1843, p. 61 et seq.— 389 
208 Cf. J. H. M. Poppe,  Geschichte  der Technologie..., Vol. 1, Göttingen, 1807, pp. 104-
05.—400 
209 Adam Smith gives this example in "Division of Labour", the first chapter of An 
Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Edinburgh, London, 
1814.—404 
210 The Nuremberg egg was the name given to the first pocket watch with a steel 
spiral spring made by the Nuremberg craftsman Peter Henlein at the very 
beginning of the 16th century. It owed this name to its oval shape.—404 
211 In this paragraph Marx gives a short summary of the entry "Baumwollspin­
nerei" in Ure's Technisches Wörterbuch, revised by K. Kramarsch and 
Dr. F. Heeren, Vol. 1, Prague, 1843, pp. 105-30.—410 
212 The anonymous work The Industry of Nations contained descriptions of the 
items on display at the Great Exhibition. The exhibition, which Marx visited, 
was held in London from May to October 1851. The above work may have 
been written by Robert Ellis.—-411 
213 Marx borrowed the term "philosophical instruments" from The Industry of 
Nations, Part II, London, 1855, which devoted an entire chapter to this subject 
(Chapter VII, pp. 286-349). What the anonymous author understood this term 
to mean were such scientific instruments as high-precision scales, thermome­
ters, barometers, hydrometers, theodolites, telescopes, microscopes, etc. The 
term "philosophical instruments" appeared in connection with "natural 
philosophy", which was used for a long time in Britain to denote physics and other 
natural sciences.—421, 456

Notes 523 
214 Th e manuscript continues with notes later crossed out by Marx: 
"VII) SILK FACTORIES 
"a) SPINNING AND WEAVING." 
There follow a number of figures. Adjacent to "Silk Factories" is the 
reference "(on the next page)". It is on this basis that the text has been 
rearranged.—432 
215 On the right of this page in the manuscript, there are auxiliary calculations, 
which are separated from the remaining text by a vertical line.—434 
216 Marx is referring here to the Crimean War of 1853-56, waged by Russia 
against Turkey, from 1854 also against Britain and France, and from 1855 
against Sardinia for domination in the Middle East.—439 
2,7 Marx is quoting below from "Agricultural Progress and Wages", published in 
The Economist, January 21, 1860 (p. 64). This article contained excerpts from 
the lecture delivered by J. C. Morton on December 7, 1859, to the Society of 
Arts and entitled "On the Forces Used in Agriculture". It was published in the 
Society's weekly The Journal of the Society of Arts, December 9, 1859. Marx made 
a conspectus of the said article in his Notebook VII of excerpts compiled in 
London between 1859 and 1863. 
The Society of Arts was an educational and philanthropic association 
founded in London in 1754.—443 
218 Acta Lipsiensia (Leipzig Chronicles) was the unofficial name of the Acta 
Eruditorum (Scholars' Chronicles), the first German scientific journal, which was 
published in Leipzig between 1682 and 1782 (in Latin).—445 
219 This and the following quotations are taken almost entirely from Notebook XV 
of excerpts, which Marx compiled in London in 1851. They are given by Marx 
in a very generalised form, since his interest focussed on the purely technical 
aspect of the development of machines. Digressions from the original are 
ignored below.—446 
220 Marx expresses the gist of Tuckett's statement. Tuckett has: "Henry Bell, a 
Scotchman, for many years a house carpenter ... was ... determined to establish 
a regular steam passage boat between Glasgow and Helensburgh, which is a 
watering place on the Clyde, opposite to Greenock... This vessel ... began to be 
propelled regularly between Glasgow and Helensburgh, in January 1812 ... it is 
remarkable, that Bell lived to see the general adoption of the grand invention, 
which he was the first in Europe to apply to practical use, and not only to be 
distanced by his rivals, but to be ruined in the competition, and reduced to 
indigence..."—449 
221 Marx gives the gist of the passage from The Industry of Nations. The original 
reads:  "In fine, all the commercial enterprises for the establishment of lines of 
steamers, where the voyages are of considerable length, have been supported 
by government."—449 
222 The excerpts from the economic manuscript of 1857-58 written by Marx on the 
inside front cover of Notebook V relate directly to the problems examined here 
in Notebook XIX, which explains the arrangement of the text in the economic 
manuscript of 1861-63. Also on the inside front cover of Notebook V there was 
a quotation from Ramsay's book An Essay on the Distribution of Wealth, 
Edinburgh, London, 1836, p. 205, which Marx apparently crossed out at a later 
date.  He had already made use of this quotation in the economic manuscript of 
1861-63 (see this volume, pp. 259-60).—479

524 Notes 
223 xhe edition Marx used has not been identified. The first edition of Hutton's book 
came out in 1798-1801. Marx referred to the elements of machines named by 
Hutton on the front cover of Notebook I of his manuscript of 1861-63.—483 
224 Mitigated jails (Les bagnes mitigés) is the name Fourier gives to factories in his 
book La fausse industrie morcelée, répugnante, mensongère, et l'antidote, l'industrie 
naturelle, combinée, attrayante, véridique, donnant quadruple produit, Paris, 1835, 
p. 59.-497 
225 Marx is referring to Volume 2 of Ure's book quoted above (see also present
