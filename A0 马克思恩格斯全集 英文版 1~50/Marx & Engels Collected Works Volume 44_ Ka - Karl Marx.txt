Preface 
Volume 44 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick 
Engels contains their correspondence from July 1870 to December 
1873.  These years marked the beginning of a new stage in the 
development of the international working-class movement. The 
proletarian revolution in Paris of 18 March 1871 resulted in the 
Paris Commune, the first working-class government in the history 
of mankind. This daring action was a milestone, 'a new point of 
departure of world-historic importance' (this volume, p. 137), 
ushering in a new phase in the struggle against capitalism. 
The Commune and the changes taking place in the working-
class movement created a pressing need for setting up indepen­
dent proletarian parties capable of leading the class struggle of the 
workers in the specific conditions of each country. The activity of 
Marx and Engels and the First International, which they led, was 
of major importance in preparing the ideological and organisa­
tional prerequisites for the formation of such parties. 
The letters of Marx and Engels in this volume are indispensable 
for the study of the activity of the International Working Men's 
Association at the final stage of its development. 
In September 1870 Engels moved from Manchester to London, 
enabling him to have continuous personal contact with Marx. 
Engels was immediately made a member of the General Council of 
the International. Here his extraordinary ability as an organiser 
and leader of the international working-class movement was given 
full scope. The circle of people with whom Marx and Engels 
corresponded became much wider, and included such prominent 
members of the International as W. Liebknecht, A. Bebel, 
J. P. Becker, L. Frankel, F. Boite, P. Lafargue, F. A. Sorge,

T. Cuno, L. Kugelmann, N. Utin (Outine), L. Pio, J. Mesa, 
F. Mora and E. Bignami, and also the democratic allies of the 
working class, E. Beesly, E. Oswald and T. Allsop. Marx and 
Engels also extended their contact with Russian revolutionaries at 
this time. 
A large number of letters in this volume concern the Franco-
Prussian War of 1870-71 and its consequences. In the situation 
which had arisen, the General Council of the International had to 
provide the proletariat, the French and German workers in 
particular, with a clear understanding of its tasks as a class. This 
was the purpose of the General Council's Address on the Franco-
Prussian War, written by Marx, which, as Engels put it, was 
intended to 'teach the populus of all classes that nowadays the 
workers are the only ones to have a real foreign policy' (p. 18). 
Marx and Engels were concerned above all to prevent the workers 
of the belligerent countries being deceived by chauvinist prop­
aganda, to advance their solidarity and help progressive workers 
realise the need for international unity and action. In his letter to 
the German democrat Eugen Oswald of 26 July 1870 Marx 
expressed the belief that 'a genuine power of resistance to the 
return of national antagonisms and the entire system of present-
day diplomacy can only be found in the working class' (p. 9). 
During the first stage of the war, when it was of a defensive 
nature for Germany, Marx and Engels distinguished clearly 
between Germany's national interests and the dynastic, territorial 
aims of Prussian Junkerdom and the German bourgeoisie. They 
warned the German workers that under the leadership of the 
Prussian militarists the war might turn into one of territorial 
aggrandisement against the French people. 
In a letter to Marx of 15 August 1870 Engels formulated the 
tasks of the German Social-Democrats at the initial stage of the 
war as follows: 'I think our people can: 1) join the national 
movement ... insofar and for so long as it is limited to the defence 
of Germany...; 2) at the same time emphasise the difference 
between German national and dynastic-Prussian interests; 3) op­
pose any annexation of Alsace and Lorraine...; 4) as soon as a 
non-chauvinistic republican government is at the helm in Paris, 
work for an honourable peace with it; 5) constantly stress the 
unity of interests between the German and French workers, who 
did not approve of the war and are also not making war on each 
other' (p. 47). 
At the end of August in a letter to the Committee of the 
German Social-Democratic Workers' Party, Marx and Engels,

Preface XIX 
anticipating a change in the character of the war with the 
inevitable collapse of the Second Empire, foresaw the consequent 
necessity for the German workers to step up the struggle against 
the annexationist aims of the Prussian militarists and the German 
bourgeoisie (pp. 79, 82). 
This prediction soon proved to be correct. On 4 September 
1870 the Second Empire collapsed and a new stage began in the 
Franco-Prussian War. The General Council's Second Address on 
the Franco-Prussian War was designed to explain the changed 
situation and outline the new tasks of the international working 
class.  Many letters by Marx and Engels also dealt with these 
matters. In defining the new tactical line of the International now 
that the war had lost its defensive character for Germany, Marx 
and Engels urged the proletariat of the European countries to 
resist resolutely the annexationist policy of the ruling classes (see, 
for example, Engels' letter to Marx of 12 September 1870 and 
Marx's letter to Engels of 14 September 1870). 
Under Marx's guidance the International conducted a campaign 
for recognition of the French Republic. 'I have set everything in 
motion here for the workers to force their government to 
recognise the French Republic. (The series of meetings begins on 
Monday),' Marx wrote to Engels on 10 September 1870 (p. 70). 
In this connection 'detailed instructions' were sent to Belgium, 
Switzerland and the United States (p. 77). 
A considerable number of letters analyse the strategic plans of 
the belligerents, the course of the military operations, and their 
possible outcome. As early as 22 July 1870 Engels, in a letter to 
Marx, predicted the likelihood of the military defeat of Bonapartist 
France. In Engels' letters one can trace how he wrote his series 
of articles Notes on the War, which made a new contribution 
to Marxism's theory of war (see present edition, Vol. 22). 
The letters of Marx and Engels concerning the Paris Commune 
give this volume special importance. 
The proletarian revolution in France was the result of the 
development of the whole workers' movement of the 1860s, which 
was profoundly influenced by the International Working Men's 
Association. The Commune, Engels wrote in a letter of 12-17 
September 1874 to Friedrich Adolph Sorge, was undoubtedly a 
brain child of the International (present edition, Vol. 45). 
From the very first days of the Paris Commune Marx set about 
studying its progress. Replying on 12 April 1871 to Ludwig 
Kugelmann, who had failed to understand the essence of the Paris 
uprising, comparing it with the action by the petty-bourgeois

XX Preface 
Montagne on 13 June 1849 in France, Marx explained the great 
historic significance of the Commune as the first attempt in history 
to destroy the military-bureaucratic state machine of the 
bourgeoisie. The destruction of this machine, Marx stressed, was 
an essential condition for the victory of a truly popular revolution 
on the Continent (this volume, p. 131). Marx wrote admiringly of 
the heroism and self-sacrifice of the Communards: 'What resil­
ience, what historical initiative, what a capacity for sacrifice in 
these Parisians! ... However that may be, the present rising in 
Paris—even if it be crushed by the wolves, swine and vile curs of 
the old society—is the most glorious deed of our Party since the 
June insurrection in Paris' (ibid., pp. 131-32). 
In his letters to Kugelmann of 12 and 17 April 1871 Marx for 
the first time expounded his understanding of the Paris Commune 
as the first attempt at a dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Marx took advantage of every opportunity to contact the leaders 
of the Commune to help them in tactical and strategic matters. 
Thus,  his letter of 13 May 1871 to Léo Frankel and Louis Eugène 
Varlin contained a plan for concrete revolutionary action and also 
a warning about the preparations for a counter-revolutionary 
attack within Paris, about the agreement against the Commune 
between Bismarck and the Versaillists (this volume, pp. 148-49). 
Already at the beginning of April, soberly assessing the alignment 
of forces, Marx realised that the chances of a victorious outcome 
for the revolution were rapidly diminishing. On 6 April in a letter 
to Wilhelm Liebknecht he elaborated on the mistakes made by the 
Communards: 'It seems the Parisians are succumbing. It is their 
own fault but a fault which really was due to their too great 
honnêteté. The Central Committee and later the Commune gave 
that mischievous avorton, Thiers, time to consolidate hostile forces, 
in the first place by their folly of not wanting to start a civil war— 
as if Thiers had not already started it by his attempt at forcibly 
disarming Paris, as if the National Assembly ... had not immediate­
ly declared war on the Republicl Secondly, in order that the 
appearance of having usurped power should not attach to them 
they lost precious moments (they should immediately have 
advanced on Versailles...) by the election of the Commune, the 
organisation of which, etc., cost yet more time' (p. 128). 
At a time when Thiers' government and the ruling classes of 
other states sought to surround the Commune with a wall of lies 
and slander, Marx and Engels considered it their duty to explain 
to the workers of all countries the historic significance of the events 
taking place in Paris. 'The true character of this grand Paris

revolution has been explained to workers everywhere in letters from 
various secretaries to sections on the Continent and in the United 
States,' Marx wrote to Frankel (p. 142). 'I have written hundreds of 
letters on behalf of your cause to all the corners of the earth where 
we have branches' (p. 149). 
After the defeat of the Commune Marx and Engels launched a 
vigorous campaign in the International to give assistance to the 
Communards. The letters show how much sympathy, attention 
and concern were shown by Engels, Marx and the members of his 
family to Commune refugees who fled to London or hid in France 
(Marx to Oswald, 21 July 1871; Marx to Friedrich Boite, 25 August 
1871;  Jenny Marx (daughter) to Kugelmann, 21-22 December 1871, 
and others). 
One of the main aims of the International after the fall of the 
Commune was to make its historic experience widely available. For 
Marx the main objective was to analyse theoretically the lessons 
of the Commune and so turn spontaneous sympathy into the con­
scious desire and ability of the proletarian masses to carry its 
cause forward to victory. The Address entitled The Civil War in 
France, written by Marx on behalf of the General Council, was 
an important milestone in the elaboration of the programme and 
principles of the proletarian movement. On 28 July 1871 Engels 
wrote to the Italian socialist Carlo Cafiero that in this document 
the General Council had openly declared itself 'in favour of 
communism' (p. 184). The history of the writing, publication and 
dissemination of this programmatic work of Marxism is reflected 
in several letters (Marx to Kugelmann, 18 June 1871; Engels to 
Liebknecht, 22 June 1871; Marx to Sorge, 23 May 1872, and 
others). 
The Paris Commune marked the high-point in the activity of 
the International Working Men's Association and the beginning of 
a new stage in the history of the international workers' movement 
as a whole. 'The thunder of the cannon in Paris awakened the 
most backward sections of the proletariat from their deep slumber, 
and everywhere gave impetus to the growth of revolutionary 
socialist propaganda' (V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 17, p. 143). 
After the defeat of the Paris Commune the ruling classes insti­
gated drastic reprisals against members of the International and 
its organisations. These were initiated by the French minister Ju­
les Favre, who appealed to all European governments on 6 June 
1871 to destroy the International. Marx and Engels fought 
resolutely against the persecution of the International, against 
attempts to distort its principles and aims and undermine its

XXII Preface 
prestige. Against this background their letters to leading members 
of the International took on a special significance. In many cases 
they were essentially official documents of the General Council. 
Passages were often read out at meetings of sections and Federal 
Councils and sometimes published in the form of articles and reports 
in the working-class press. Thus the correspondence of Marx and 
Engels took on an importance as a means of disseminating the ideas 
of scientific socialism in the organisations of the Association and of 
educating proletarian revolutionaries. 
After the Paris Commune Marx and Engels regarded as one of 
the International's most important tasks the further elaboration of 
its political programme. The experience of the Commune made it 
possible to augment the socialist principles of the future social 
system proclaimed in the resolutions of the Brussels and Basle 
congresses, and specify the ways and means of carrying out the 
socialist transformation of society. The lessons of the Com­
mune were generalised in the resolutions of the London Confe­
rence held in September 1871. Its convocation was necessary 
because, to quote Engels, there were 'several important questions 
to deal with before proceeding further' (p. 187). The Conference 
adopted an historic resolution on the creation in each country of 
an independent proletarian party, whose aim should be to prepare 
the working class for revolutionary battles for political power. 
Marx rated the importance of the Conference highly, noting that 
at this one 'more was done than at all the previous Congresses put 
together' (p. 220). 
As the correspondence shows, Marx and Engels devoted much 
attention to explaining the importance of the London Confe­
rence resolutions. In a letter to Bolte of 23 November 1871, 
discussing the role of a proletarian party in the establishment of a 
dictatorship of the proletariat, Marx wrote: 'The political move­
ment of the working class naturally has as its final object the 
conquest of political power for this class, and this requires, of 
course, a previous organisation of the working class developed up 
to a certain point, which arises from the economic struggles 
themselves' (p. 258). 
The work of the London Conference took place amid an acute 
ideological struggle between the proletarian-revolutionary trend 
led by Marx and Engels, and Bakuninism. The Paris Com­
mune had drawn a clear dividing line between the proletarian 
revolutionaries and the representatives of Bakuninist anarchism. 
The Bakuninists furiously attacked the basic theses of the 
political programme set out in the resolutions of the London

Preface XXIII 
Conference. In their circular issued in Sonvillier in November 
1871 they denied the need for the proletariat to gain political 
power, for the creation of a proletarian party and for discipline 
and centralisation, and demanded the 'abolition of all authority', 
suggesting as a practical step in this direction that the governing 
body of the International, the General Council, should be turned 
into a bureau for statistics and correspondence. On 2 January 
1872 Engels wrote to Liebknecht with reference to the circular: 
'That is really the last straw and we shall now take action' (p. 289). 
The Bakuninists were answered in the joint works by Marx and 
Engels mentioned in the letters, Fictitious Splits in the International 
and The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working 
Men's Association (present edition, Vol. 23). 
In their numerous letters to working-class activists in different 
countries Marx and Engels subjected the main theses of anarchism 
to criticism. They exposed the idealism of Bakunin, who regarded 
as the main source of all social evils not the exploiting nature of 
the social system, but the state, and who saw the abolition of the 
latter as the way to get rid of capitalism (Engels to Theodor Cuno, 
24 January 1872, this volume, pp. 305-07); they emphasised that 
abstention from politics turned workers into the blind instrument 
of bourgeois politicians; and they demonstrated the untenability of 
the anarchist rejection of authority. Engels wrote: '...for the 
struggle we need to gather all our forces into a single band and 
concentrate them on the same point of attack. And when people 
speak to me about authority and centralisation as if they were two 
things to be condemned in all possible circumstances, it seems to 
me that those who talk like this, either do not know what a 
revolution is, or are revolutionaries in name only' (Engels to 
Carlo Terzaghi, 14[-15] January 1872, this volume, p. 295). 
Marx and Engels condemned the Bakuninists' denial of the 
need for a proletarian state. In a letter to Paul Lafargue of 
30 December 1871 Engels showed for the first time, before 
writing his work On Authority, that the conditions of large-scale 
machine production insistently demanded state management and 
regulation. In the above-mentioned letter to Terzaghi he also 
drew attention to the experience of the Commune, which 
confirmed the need for the proletarian state to take measures in 
the struggle against counter-revolution. 'It was the lack of 
centralisation and authority that cost the life of the Paris 
Commune' (p. 295). 
In their letters to members of the International Marx and 
Engels argued that the organisational doctrines of anarchism were

XXIV Preface 
incompatible with the Rules and the very spirit of the Internation­
al and were disorganising and splitting the movement at a time 
when solidarity and unity of action by the workers were vital in 
the face of the offensive mounted by the reactionary forces. 
Sending Lafargue in Madrid the section of the Fictitious Splits 
dealing with the functions of the General Council, Marx wrote in 
his covering letter: '...our Association is the militant organisation of 
the proletariat... To destroy our organisation just now would be to 
abdicate. Bourgeois and governments combined could ask for 
nothing more' (p. 346). In the struggle against Bakuninism Marx 
and Engels consistently upheld the principles of proletarian party 
commitment. As one of the conditions for ensuring the unity of 
the international proletarian organisation Marx and Engels ad­
vanced the principle of party discipline, the bowing of the 
minority to the will of the majority, or, as Engels wrote, 'the 
authority of the majority over the minority' (p. 307). 
In the summer of 1872 Marx and Engels began to receive 
information to the effect that the Alliance of Socialist Democracy, 
which the Bakuninists had declared dissolved, was in fact being 
retained as a strictly conspiratorial society. The existence within 
the International of a secret international organisation of Bakunin­
ists with its own Rules and programme meant that Bakunin and 
his supporters were in practice attempting to split the Internation­
al Working Men's Association. 'Bakunin retained the Alliance de la 
démocratie socialiste, which you know of from the Scissions, as a 
secret society in order to obtain control of the International,' 
Engels wrote to Adolf Hepner on 4 August 1872 (p. 415). 
Marx and Engels attached particular importance to exposing the 
Bakuninists to the workers of Spain and Italy, where their position 
was especially strong. 
On Marx's proposal the General Council on 11 June 1871 
passed a resolution to convene a Congress of the Association at 
The Hague on 2 September 1872. It was to take stock of the 
International's activity since the Basle Congress, incorporate the 
resolutions of the London Conference into the General Rules and 
Administrative Regulations, complete the drawing up of a political 
programme and put an end to the disorganising activity of the 
anarchists. In letters to Sorge and Kugelmann Marx stressed that 
the question of the life or death of the International would be 
decided at the Congress (pp. 398, 413). 
The Congress was the scene of a fierce struggle between the 
supporters of the revolutionary proletarian line and the anarchist 
delegates, backed by the reformists. The latter joined with the

Preface XXV 
Bakuninists, who were against public recognition as essential to the 
programme of the International, of the idea of winning state 
power by the proletariat and of the need to form mass political 
parties of the working class independent of the bourgeoisie. The 
resolution adopted was based on proposals put forward by Marx 
and Engels and their comrades-in-arms. 
With the exacerbation of ideological differences after the 
Congress, Marx and Engels attached special importance to the 
widespread propagation of the Congress decisions and the 
struggle for their acceptance. 
In fighting for international unity of the working class Marx 
and Engels were at the same time concerned to promote 
the development of the proletarian movement in individual 
countries. 
They gave special attention to the German Social-Democratic 
Workers' Party. In the period following the first proletarian 
revolution of 1871 Marx's prediction that the centre of gravity of 
the working-class movement would shift from France to Germany 
proved to be true. In the workers' press and in their letters 
Marx and Engels popularised the experience of this most advanced 
organised detachment of the proletariat. They applauded the 
brilliant defence of the principles of the Commune by their comra­
des-in-arms in Germany. 'The German workers,' Engels wrote 
to Liebknecht on 22 June 1871, 'have behaved themselves quite 
splendidly in this last great crisis, better than anyone else. And 
Bebel has been an outstanding spokesman on their  behalf;  his 
speech on the Commune went through the entire English press 
and made a great impression here' (p. 160). The movement in 
support of the Commune promoted the class solidarity of the 
German workers and their political education in the spirit of 
proletarian internationalism. 
Marx and Engels spoke proudly of the courageous behaviour of 
Liebknecht, Bebel and other representatives of German Social-
Democracy who, during the trials, made use of the court as a 
tribune to agitate for the principles of the International. 'Dear 
Liebknecht,' Engels wrote on 23 April 1872, 'we all send you our 
congratulations on your performance in court. After the trial of 
the Brunswickers it was essential for someone to stand up to that 
gang and you have fairly done so' (p. 360). 
In their letters to party leaders Marx and Engels persistently 
stressed the need for delegates from Germany to take part in the 
Hague Congress (pp. 376-77). They attached special importance to 
support at the Congress for the General Council's line by the most

powerful and best organised detachment of the International, the 
Eisenach Party. 
Whilst they were aware of the need for the unity of the 
working-class movement in Germany, Marx and Engels feared 
that, if a united party were set up, leadership of it might be seized 
by the Lassalleans, because certain of the Eisenach leaders were 
prepared to sacrifice programme and principle for the sake of 
unity. On 20 June 1873 Engels wrote to Bebel giving his views on 
overcoming the split in the working-class movement in general, 
and in Germany in particular. The tactics of the struggle against 
the influence of the Lassalleans, he wrote, lay not in winning over 
individual members of their organisation. It presupposed, first 
and foremost, acting upon the broad mass of workers, propagat­
ing the ideas of scientific socialism among them. The unification 
of the Eisenach Party with the Lassallean General Association of 
German Workers should be brought about on the basis of a 
revolutionary programme, and in such a way as to prevent the 
subversion of the movement's socialist principles and aims by 
reformist and sectarian dogmas. 'There are circumstances in which 
one must have the courage to sacrifice momentary success for more 
important things' (p. 512). 
In their letters to the leaders of the German working-class 
movement Marx and Engels stressed the need to fight for the 
ideological soundness of the party, to overcome ideological 
vacillations and accept responsibilities towards the international 
working-class movement (Engels to Liebknecht, 18-22 May 1872, 
and other letters). 
The fate of the working-class movement in England, the 
opportunities and prospects for the creation of a proletarian party 
in the British Isles, was of constant concern to Marx and Engels. 
In the early 1870s a reformist outlook was dominant in the 
English working class. Its main vehicle was the labour aristocracy, 
an influential and considerable section of the working class in 
England. Marx and Engels were quick to understand the con­
sequences of reformism's domination of the working-class move­
ment (see Engels' letter to Hepner of 30 December 1872). The 
labour aristocracy's ideological dependence on the liberal bour­
geoisie was shown clearly in its attitude to the Paris Commune: 
the English members of the General Council George Odger 
and Benjamin Lucraft refused to show solidarity with the Com­
mune. Engels informed Cafiero of this on 28 July 1871: '... two 
English members of the Council, who had been getting on too 
close terms with the bourgeoisie, found our address on the civil

war too strong and they withdrew' (p. 186). A considerable 
number of trades-union leaders, including several English work­
ing-class members of the International, were becoming typical 
liberal politicians, many aspiring to parliamentary, state and 
administrative posts. 
Marx and Engels were sharply perceptive of the processes tak­
ing place in the English working-class movement, and were the 
first to note the presence of the two tendencies, reformist and 
revolutionary, and the growing influence of the bourgeoisified 
upper layers of the proletariat. This added urgency to their 
persistent efforts for an independent proletarian party that would 
withstand the influence of reformism. The correspondence of 
these years shows how consistently they continued to work in 
England for the ideas and the influence of the International, 'to 
render it independent of the aristocracy of the working classes 
and its acknowledged leaders' (p. 147). 
Marx and Engels had great hopes for the British Federal 
Council of the International, set up in the autumn of 1871, which 
they believed should become the nucleus of a future working-class 
party. They criticised strongly the reformist wing of the British 
Federation, which sought to limit the political struggle of the 
working class exclusively to the struggle for parliamentary 
representation, and denounced the so-called 'acknowledged lead­
ers' of the working class, 'all of whom either have been bought 
by the middle class or are begging them to make them an 
offer' (p. 383). Engels' letters to Sorge of 21 September and 
5 October 1872 give a vivid description of the bitter struggle 
which was taking place between the revolutionary and reformist 
wings in the English sections of the International. 
A large group of letters by Marx and Engels forms an important 
source on the history of the International in the United States of 
America. 
In this period the working class in the USA continued to be 
formed mostly by immigrants arriving from various European 
countries. Its multinational composition and the differences in 
language, traditions, customs, views and level of education made 
the political cohesion of the proletariat difficult. The existing 
organisation of the International was dominated by the German 
and French sections, in which Lassallean and Proudhonist 
influences were strong. In time the first sections of American-
born workers and members of the petty bourgeoisie appeared, 
and also several Irish sections. Marx and Engels corresponded 
with Friedrich Adolph Sorge, Carl Speyer, Friedrich Bolte and other

XXVIII Preface 
members of the International in the USA. The prime task of the 
American socialists, in the opinion of Marx and Engels, consisted 
in overcoming national separateness and isolation from the broad 
mass of workers which inevitably led to sectarianism. In a letter to 
Bolte of 23 November 1871 Marx stressed: 'The development 
of socialist sectarianism and that of the real labour movement 
always stand in indirect proportion to each other' (p. 252). Marx 
believed that the way to get rid of sectarianism was, first and 
foremost, to work with the proletarian masses in the trades unions. 
'You must strive to win the support of the Trades Unions at all 
costs,'  he wrote in a letter to Speyer of 10 November 1871 
(P- 244). 
In his letter to Bolte Marx also touched on the problem of 
creating a mass political organisation of the working class in 
America: 'Where the working class is not yet far enough advanced 
in its organisation to undertake a decisive campaign against the 
collective power, i.e. the political power, of the ruling classes, it 
must at any rate be trained for this by continual agitation against, 
and a hostile attitude towards, the policies of the ruling classes' 
(p. 258). Marx and Engels supported Sorge and other proletarian 
revolutionaries in the USA in their struggle against bourgeois 
reformers' attempts to make use of the International's organisa­
tions in America for their own purposes. 
The transfer of the General Council to New York in the autumn 
of 1872 greatly stimulated the working-class movement in the USA 
and contributed to the spread of Marxism on the American 
continent. 
The defeat of the Paris Commune and the subsequent 
persecution of members of the International considerably reduced 
the number of Marx's and Engels' correspondents in France. 
Government reprisals dealt a severe blow to the working-class 
organisations and sections of the International Working Men's 
Association. Nevertheless, at the beginning of August 1871 the 
General Council began to receive information about the renewal 
of sections and the activity of syndicalist chambers. The ties of 
local sections with Commune refugees who were members of the 
General Council were being resumed. 
The London Conference of 1871 gave new impetus to the 
revival of the French sections, providing a realistic programme of 
action to unite and reorganise the ranks of the working class. On 
19 January 1872 Engels wrote to Lafargue: 'In France Serraillier 
is being amazingly active. Needless to say, the results he has 
obtained are not for publication, but they are very good.

Preface XXIX 
Everywhere the sections are reforming under different names' 
(p. 302). In his letter to Lafargue of 21 March Marx also 
remarked upon the success of the International in France 
following the London Conference (p. 346). 
The majority of the French members of the International, 
except Bakunin's supporters and the Blanquists, who had broken 
with the International Working Men's Association, approved the 
resolutions of the Hague Congress of 1872. 'Despite the intrigues 
of the Jurassians and the Blanquists things are going well in the 
South,' Engels wrote to Sorge on 7 December 1872 (p. 454). But 
in February 1873 the organisation of the International was again 
crushed, after which it did not manage to recover. Analysing the 
causes for the defeat of the French sections, Marx and Engels in 
their letters to Sorge, Auguste Serraillier and others criticised the 
voluntarist views of the Blanquists, discussed the prospects for the 
development of the working-class movement in France and 
expressed their conviction that it would be reborn in new forms. 
The contents of this volume provide an insight into the work 
Marx and Engels were doing to assist the proletarian movement in 
Italy and Spain. The establishment of ties with the Italian and 
Spanish working-class organisations involved a sharp ideological 
struggle against the influence of anarchists and bourgeois republi­
cans.  The main burden was shouldered by Engels, who was the 
Corresponding Secretary of the General Council for Italy and 
Spain. Following the transfer of the Council to New York in the 
autumn of 1872, Engels continued as its representative to maintain 
contacts with progressive members of the socialist and working-
class movement in these countries. 
Engels' correspondence with Italian revolutionaries was im­
portant as a means of conveying the ideas of scientific socialism to 
Italy. His letters to the Italian socialist Carlo Cafiero were important. 
In them Engels explained the nature of the International as a 
broadly-based mass workers' organisation alien to all sectarianism, 
stressing that the task of the Association was to unite the workers 
and draw up, by means of theoretical discussions, a truly 
revolutionary programme. 
In his letter to Cafiero of 28 July 1871 Engels defined the main 
issues over which there was a struggle in the International and 
contrasted the fundamental propositions of scientific socialism 
with Bakuninist dogma and Mazzinist petty-bourgeois views. 
In explaining the programmatic aims of the proletarian move­
ment and arguing the need for the working class to win state 
power, Engels pointed out: 'We must free ourselves from

landowners and capitalists, and for this end promote the devel­
opment of the associated classes of agricultural and industrial 
workers and all the means of production, land, tools, machines, 
raw materials and whatever means exist to support life during the 
time necessary for production. ...And to bring this about we need 
the political supremacy of the proletariat' (p. 184). A considerable 
part of this letter is devoted to a detailed criticism of Mazzinism as 
one of the trends of 'vulgar democracy', which strove to give the 
workers some political rights 'in order to preserve intact the social 
privileges of the middle and upper classes' (p. 185). 
In criticising Mazzini's views and condemning his attacks on the 
International and the Paris Commune, Engels contrasted him with 
another fighter for Italy's national liberation, Giuseppe Garibaldi, 
who openly sympathised with the International Working Men's 
Association and the Paris Communards (see Engels' letter to Cuno, 
13 November 1871). 
Of considerable interest is Engels' correspondence with the 
German Social-Democrat Theodor Cuno, the organiser of a 
section of the International in Milan. The comprehensive critique 
of Bakuninism contained in Engels' letter of 24 January 1872 was 
of great help to Cuno in fighting the anarchists. 
At this time Engels conducted a regular correspondence with 
Enrico Bignami and Cesare Bert, helping them to activate the 
sections of the International in Lodi and Turin. In a letter to the 
Italian democrat and member of the workers' movement Gennaro 
Bovio of 16 April 1872, Engels expressed the profound idea that 
the proletariat's national and international tasks formed an organic 
unity. He argued that 'in the working-class movement true national 
ideas,  i.e. ideas corresponding to the economic realities, both in 
industry and in agriculture, to the realities that are dominant in 
the country in question, are, at the same time, true international 
ideas'  (p. 355). 
Engels' ties with Spanish internationalists, first established even 
before the Paris Commune, grew much stronger during the 
period of the Commune and immediately after. Before the 
London Conference Engels considered it his responsibility to 
strengthen these contacts and keep his correspondents informed 
about the International and the activity of the General Council. 
He was greatly assisted in this by Lafargue, who moved to Madrid 
in December 1871. Lafargue played an invaluable part in 
criticising anarchist views, a struggle which became Engels' main 
preoccupation after the London Conference. 
A result of the influence exerted on the leading representatives

Preface XXXI 
of the Spanish working-class movement by Marx and Engels was 
the emergence of a group of proletarian revolutionaries (José 
Mesa, Francisco Mora and others), who spread the ideas of 
scientific socialism and resisted the influence of the anarchists. Its 
newspaper was La Emancipacion and its organisational centre the 
New Madrid Federation, founded in the summer of 1872. 
Marx and Engels attached great importance to the revolutionary 
movement in Russia, and made a deep study of the socio-economic 
and political situation there. The letters reveal their connections 
with progressive social and political figures and representatives of 
different circles of Russian revolutionaries. 
As the General Council's Corresponding Secretary for Russia, 
Marx gave continuous assistance to the Russian section of the 
International in Switzerland. He informed the Russian rev­
olutionaries of the situation in the Association and the decisions 
of its Council and sent them the necessary documents. Marx 
greatly valued the fact that during the bitter struggle against 
anarchism the Russian section came out strongly against Bakunin 
and supported the revolutionary-proletarian wing of the Interna­
tional. In his regular correspondence with Nikolai Utin (Outine), 
one of the leaders of the Russian section, Marx discussed the 
essence of the ideological differences with the anarchists and the 
splitting activities of Bakunin's Alliance. 
The close attention Marx and Engels paid to Russia and their 
friendly contacts with progressive people there are exemplified by 
Marx's letters to Nikolai Danielson and Engels' to Pyotr Lavrov 
published in this volume. By this time Marx could read Russian 
scientific and socio-political literature in the original sufficiently 
to delve more deeply into the problems of Russia's social and 
political development. He wrote to Sigfrid Meyer on 21 January 
1871:  'The result was worth the effort that a man of my age must 
make to master a language differing so greatly from the classical, 
Germanic and Romance languages. The intellectual movement 
now taking place in Russia testifies to the fact that things are 
seething deep below the surface. Minds are always connected by 
invisible threads with the body of the people' (p. 105). Through 
Danielson Marx sent General Council documents to Russia and 
received essential material, books and journals. From Marx's 
letters it is clear that he studied the works of N. Flerovsky 
(pseudonym of Vasily Bervi) and Nikolai Chernyshevsky, for 
whom he had the deepest respect. He referred to Cher­
nyshevsky's economic works as excellent (p. 105). On receiv­
ing from Danielson the manuscript of Chernyshevsky's Letters

XXXII Preface 
Without an Address Marx tried to get it printed, regarding it as an 
extremely important work (p. 457). It was at this time that Marx 
conceived the idea, as can be seen from his letters to Danielson of 
12 December 1872 and 18 January 1873, of writing a biography 
of the great Russian revolutionary democrat and socialist. Marx 
also highly valued the work of Chernyshevsky's comrade-in-arms, 
Nikolai Dobrolyubov (see his letter to Danielson of 9 November 
1871,  p. 238). 
Marx and Engels established particularly close relations with the 
Russian revolutionary Hermann Lopatin, a member of the 
General Council of the International, whom they also greatly 
respected. Very often in his letters to Danielson Marx enquired 
anxiously about Lopatin, who was arrested at the beginning of the 
1870s in connection with the attempt to help Chernyshevsky 
escape from exile in Siberia. 'The fate of our dear "mutual 
friend" has been of the very greatest interest to my entire family,' 
Marx wrote on 12 December 1872 (p. 456). The news that 
Lopatin had succeeded in escaping from prison in Irkutsk in the 
summer of 1873 was received joyfully in Marx's home. 
The revolutionary movement in Russia, which was steadily 
gaining strength, was regarded by Marx and Engels as an 
important indication of the maturing in that country of a popular 
revolution against tsarism. They saw the participants in this 
movement as the direct allies of the European proletariat. 'In 
Russia,' Marx wrote to Thomas Allsop on 23 December 1873, 
'...the elements of a general convulsion are accumulating' (p. 551). 
Convinced of the inevitability of a Russian revolution, Marx and 
Engels believed that it would lead to a radical change in the 
international situation and help the working class of the capitalist 
countries to achieve its aims. 
The Hague Congress of 1872 was in fact the last congress of the 
International Working Men's Association. Later some of the 
federations temporarily followed the anarchists, who set up their 
own short-lived international association; the majority of the 
federations, however, now had to tackle the complex task of 
creating a proletarian party in their respective countries. In its 
former organisational forms the International had exhausted its 
role;  it had created a firm ideological basis for the formation of 
proletarian parties bound together by a common ultimate aim and 
an understanding of the need for the international unity of the 
working class. 'As I view European conditions,' Marx wrote to 
Sorge on 27 September 1873, 'it is quite useful to let the formal 
organisation of the International recede into the background for 

=====第31页=====
Preface XXXIII 
the time being... Events and the inevitable development and 
intertwining of things will of themselves see to it that the 
International rises again in an improved form' (p. 535). 
By the end of 1873 the International had in effect retired from 
this historical arena. The activity of its organisations had ceased 
almost everywhere, although the final decision as to its dissolution 
was taken at the conference in Philadelphia on 15 July 1876. One 
of the finest phases of Marx's activity ended. Commenting on the 
historic role played by the International, Engels wrote to Sorge 
on 12-17 September 1874 that for ten years the International had 
dominated one side of European history, that which moulded the 
future, and it could look back to its work with pride (see present 
edition, Vol. 45). 
Lenin also frequently stressed the tremendous significance of 
the International in the history of the struggle of the proletariat. 
The First International, he pointed out, 'laid the foundation of an 
international organisation of the workers for the preparation of 
their revolutionary attack on capital' (V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, 
Vol. 29, p. 306). 
In spite of' the heavy burden of International business, Marx 
and Engels continued their intense theoretical activity. The 
correspondence in this volume enables one to trace the writing by 
Marx and Engels of several important works. Apart from those 
mentioned above, they include the preface by Marx and Engels to 
the 1872 German edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party 
and Engels' work The Housing Question. Engels' letter to Marx 
of 30 May 1873 contains the first outline of the philosophical 
work planned by him, Dialectics of Nature (see this volume, 
pp. 500-03). 
As can be seen from the letters, Marx attached particular 
importance to the completion of his major work, Capital, and the 
perfecting of Volume I of it, which had been published in 1867. 
In the 1870s the demand for Capital among the workers grew. 
The influence of the ideas of scientific socialism amongst the 
working class, particularly after the Paris Commune, as well as the 
need to counteract petty-bourgeois ideology, impelled Marx to 
prepare a second German edition of Capital (see Engels' letters to 
Liebknecht and Lafargue of 15 and 30 December 1871, this 
volume, pp. 282, 286). 
From Marx's correspondence for this period it is clear that he 
invested a great deal of work making changes both in the 
structure and in the subject matter  itself. 
With respect to Marx's work on the second German edition of 
2-556 

=====第32页=====
XXXIV Preface 
Volume I of Capital, his daughter Jenny wrote on 22 January 
1872 to Kugelmann: 'In the first chapter he has made great 
alterations, and what is more important, he himself is satisfied 
(which does not happen often) with these alterations. The work he 
has done these last few weeks is immense, and it is really a wonder 
that his health ... has not given way under it' (p. 574). The second 
German edition of Volume I of Capital, which came out in 
1872-73,  in a large edition for those days (three thousand copies), 
was a most important event. 
The authorised edition of Volume I of Capital in French was 
intended to make Marx's economic theory accessible to the 
workers not only of France, but also of other Romance countries. 
The French edition of Capital was published in instalments over 
the period 17 September 1872 to November 1875. The letters 
testify to Marx's intense, painstaking work to polish the transla­
tion made by Joseph Roy, and also to revise in part the origi­
nal itself.  'He [Mr Roy] has often translated too literally,' Marx 
wrote to Danielson on 28 May 1872. 'I have therefore found 
myself compelled to re-write whole passages in French, to make 
them palatable to the French public. It will be all the easier later 
on to translate the book from French into English and the 
Romance languages' (p. 385). 
Marx gave serious attention to the preparation of a Russian 
edition of Volume I of Capital Its publication in March 1872 had 
great impact on the development of progressive social thought in 
Russia. The Russian edition was the first translation into a foreign 
language of this brilliant work, and Marx had a very high opinion 
of it. On 28 May 1872 he wrote to Danielson: 'First of all, my best 
thanks for the beautifully bound copy. The translation is masterly. I 
would be grateful if you could let me have a second, unbound 
copy—for the British Museum' (p. 385). Engels also praised the 
Russian translation. He considered this edition highly important 
for educating Russian revolutionaries. 'As far as talent and 
character are concerned some of these are absolutely among the 
very best in our party,' he stressed in a letter to Johann Philipp 
Becker of 14 June 1872 (p. 396). 
The volume concludes the publication of that section of Marx's 
and Engels' correspondence (begun in Volume 42) which belongs 
to the period of their activity as leaders of the First International. 
The letters bring out characteristic features of the creative 
collaboration of Marx and Engels, and also their relations with 
followers and associates. Engels' letter to his mother of 21 October 
1871 testifies to his unshakable loyalty to his revolutionary

convictions and readiness to defend them come what may. The 
reader can learn much about the lives of Marx's daughters. Thus, 
a number of letters describe the dangers and deprivations 
endured by Marx's middle daughter, Laura, the wife of Paul 
Lafargue, who shared her husband's fate as a political exile; and 
the police harassment of his eldest and youngest daughters, 
Jenny and Eleanor, during their stay in the south of France. This

MARX TO ENGELS 1 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 20 July 1870 
DEAR FRED, 
Enclosed a letter from Kugelmann 2 which significantly clarifies 
the political  MYSTERIES  of the present war. 3 He is in the right with his 
criticism of the proclamation of the Brunswick meeting3  SOME  COPIES 
of which I enclose. I am also sending you the RéveiL 4 You will find 
in it the first half of the acte d'accusation h presented before the 
Supreme Court at Blois 5; what a poor figure the French 
CONSPIRATORS cut, compared to the FENIANS,6  as they transform 
themselves into mouchards 0 without the least provocation. The 
paper is also interesting on account of the leading article by old 
Delescluze. Although he is opposed to the government, it's just 
unadulterated chauvinism, car la France est le seul pays de l'idée d 
(namely, the idea it has of itself). These republican chauvinists are 
only indignant because the actual incarnation of their idol— 
Louis Bonaparte with his long nose and his stock exchange rigging 
—does not correspond to their FANCY. The French deserve a good 
hiding. If the Prussians win, then centralisation of the STATE POWER 
will be beneficial for the centralisation of the German working 
class.  German predominance would then shift the centre of gravity 
of the West European workers' movement from France to 
Germany, and you need only to compare developments in the two 
countries from 1866 to the present day to realise that the German 
working class is superior to the French both in theory and

organisation. Its predominance over the French on the interna­
tional stage would also mean the predominance of our theory over 
Proudhon's, etc. 
Finally, I enclose a review of my book from Hildebrand's journal 
for economics and statistics.3 The state of my health does not 
really predispose me to merriment, but this essay brought the 
tears to my eyes, bona fide tears of laughter. With the reaction and 
the DOWNFALL of the heroic age of philosophy in Germany, the  'petty 
bourgeois' latent in the German citizen has once again come to the 
fore—in philosophy nonsense worthy of Moses Mendelssohn; 
the smart-alecky, bad-tempered carping of wiseacres and know-
alls. And they now want to dissolve political economy into a lot of 
rubbish about legal conceptsl That goes one better than the 
'logarithm of stimuli'.7 As Schiller, a competent judge in this 
sphere, has already noted, the philistine resolves all questions by 
making them 'a matter of conscience'. 
Apropos! A Yankee JOURNAL which I was reading yesterday in the 
Central Council is publishing a series of articles about capital, etc. 
It refers to my bookb among others. According to them I believe 
that the worker must work for a certain portion of the day for his 
own needs, and that therefore the work over and above that time, 
which I call SURPLUS LABOUR, forms the surplus value and hence the 
source of profit, etc. There is something in this, no doubt, they 
continue, but it is not the whole truth. For instance, the goods 
produced by a manufacturer=  0 for him until they have been sold. 
Let us assume then that the  REAL  VALUE  (he means cost price) of 
clothes,  etc.  = a By selling them to the merchant the manufacturer 
adds b, and this is then increased by c by the different 
businessmen through whose hands the articles pass. 
Therefore: VALUE^O. The increments= b  + c. VALVE  IN USE, 
THEREFORE, =  a+ b+  c. Therefore, surplus value  = excess  of use value (!) 
over value. This really beats the 'FORMULE' which Frankel learnt in 
Paris!  8 
Just interrupted while writing. Taran,c  the French Italian, drove 
up in a  CAB (he's the man from The Pall Mall Gazette). He brought 
back the things by Lassalle, etc., that I had lent him. He is going 
to Paris as war-correspondent. Inquired whether I would like to go 
to Prussia in that capacity, or if not, whether I could propose 
anyone else. Through him I am now so  FAR in contact with the Pall

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 22 July 1870 
Dear Moor, 
Three cheers for Kugelmann! It is obvious that he did not go to 
school for nothing. His hypothesis is very much in the spirit of the 
protagonists and explains everything. 3 If it is correct in actual fact, 
then Bismarck at least has bitten off more than he can chew. 
Those worthies have obviously managed to set off a full-scale 
national war in Germany. The numerous tâtonnements with 
regard to the cession of German territory, Luxembourg, etc., by 
which means Louis Bonaparte tried, as usual, to accustom the 
public in advance to the approaching fait accompli, have had quite 
the opposite effect on ordinary Germans. They have obviously 
made up their minds this time to put a stop to all such tricks once 
and for all. This being so, and considering the attitude of the two 
armies and of stubborn old William, 0 a pretend-war is not possible. 
On ira au  fond d 
The sudden vacillation and uncertainty evident in the French 
operations—obviously planned for the middle of this week—is 
proof that Louis Bonaparte realises how badly he has miscalcu­
lated. The swift intervention of the South Germans and then the 
certainty that he will have the whole German people on his hands 
has frustrated the attempt to launch a surprise attack on Mainz 
with his artillery and then to form a spearhead in the direction of 
Würzburg, with no more than half his forces mobilised. If he can now 
attack at all, he will have to deploy all his forces. But there's still 
time for that. The order to form the fourth regimental battalions 
did not go out before the 15th or 16th. Their units consist of four 
companies of the three field battalions of each regiment, so they 
must first be increased to 6-8 companies and supplemented by 
reserves. The men on leave were called up in Paris on the 19th and 
20th, the trained reserves on 21 and 22 July, and the untrained 
reserves receive their papers tomorrow. The regiments will not be 
complete until the first two categories have joined them. And this

means that—skirmishes apart—the campaign will have to be 
delayed to the middle of next week at the earliest. By then, 
however, the Germans may be so strong that Bonaparte will find it 
necessary to await the fourth battalions, and that means a delay of 
another 8-14 days. And by then he'll be fou tu* 
Yesterday I was told by a local German philistine that he had 
been travelling on a train in Westphalia last Saturday with a 
Prussian general who had taken him for an Englishman and had 
spoken to him in English. He said: *'It is true enough, we are 
about ten days behindhand, but if during ten days you do not 
hear that we have suffered a great defeat, we shall soon have your 
sympathies.'* On being asked what he meant, he said: *'The 
sympathies of the English, you know, are always on the side of 
success.'* 
Mobilisation began on the 16th in Northern Germany and on 
the 17th in Bavaria. The reserves and Landwehr 11 infantry can be 
at the ready in about 8 days and the rest will be available about 
13 days from the start of mobilisation. That means that the entire 
infantry will be ready on the 25th and everything else on the 30th. 
But since the reserves are joining up in great numbers without 
being ordered to, the field army will be ready even sooner. It is 
certain that the 7th, 8th, 11th and 12th army corps are standing 
on the Rhine. The Guard has also left Berlin, as I hear from 
Borchardt who arrived from there yesterday. I suppose it is on its 
way to Bavaria to serve under the handsome Crown Prince. b The 
transport of troops from the East through Berlin was due to begin 
yesterday. From Sunday or Monday on Bonaparte will be able to 
occupy the Palatinate at the most, but he will no longer be able to 
cross the Rhine unless the other side makes crass errors. From the 
end of next week the Germans can attack and start an army 
rolling towards France that will smash everything Bonaparte can 
put in its way, albeit after fierce battles. As things stand at present, 
I do not believe that the campaign can possibly end well for 
Bonaparte. 
I suppose I would like to write 2 articles weekly on the war for 
The Pall Mall Gazette for good cash payment.12 I shall do a trial 
piece on military organisation. 3-4 guineas per article ought to be 
right; the Guardianc used to pay me 2 guineas and would have 
paid even more.13 If you can arrange that tomorrow, let me know

besides I would have a less criticial vantage-point there than here. 
You can see from the enclosed cuttings what we have been 
engaged on here. The Guardian report is by us14; what a

Haverstock Hill, N.W. 
Dear Sir, 
I must first of all ask your forgiveness for my delay in replying 
to you. Your letter arrived on Thursday3 at 6 p.m.; I had just left 
London for a TRIP IN the COUNTRY. 
However, I would not have been able to join in a public 
AddressI5 because the General Council of the International 
Working Men's Association, of which I am a member, had already 
charged me with the task of composing a similar Address.b The 
piece had been written already, submitted for discussion and was 
approved unanimously last Tuesday. It was to have appeared in 
The Times today, but was suppressed, probably because it 
contained a hit at Russia. However, there is some prospect of its 
appearing in the Pall MalU Paris is now in a state of siege. We 
have organs at our disposal in all other West European countries 
and in the United States. 
Should the Address be published here you will discover that its 
political viewpoint (and it is this we are concerned with in the first 
instance) coincides with your own, however widely our social views 
may diverge. AT  ALL  EVENTS,  I am convinced that a genuine power of 
resistance to the return of national antagonisms and the entire 
system of present-day diplomacy can only be found in the working 
class. 
However that may be, I am quite prepared to have further 
discussions on this important subject. Please let me know whether 
and when you might honour me with a visit, or when I can find 
you at home. 
Yours sincerely, 
Karl Marx

MARX  TO ENGELS 16 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  28 July  1870 
DEAR  FRED, 
I forwarded your article"  at once  to the  Pall Mall  EDITOR 
(F. Greenwood), with  the  request  to  return  it immediately  if he 
does  not  wish  to print  it. I  have  no  doubt that,  in that event,  we 
could place  it with  The  Times  or The  Daily News. 
The Times  had  given  us  every reason,  via  Eccarius,  to believe  it 
would print  our  (i.e.  the  International's)  ADDRESS.13  It did not  appear, 
probably because of a  HIT AT  RUSSIA.  Whereupon  (MONDAY LASTC)  I 
sent the  thing  off  without delay  to the  Pall Mall  and  also wrote  to 
the EDITOR,17  in  accordance with  the  agreement with their WAR 
CORRESPONDENT  (Thieblin, now in Luxembourg), about the  MILITARY 
CORRESPONDENCE.  Requested an  ANSWER.  NO  REPLY.  Nor was the Address 
printed.  So  today  on  sending your article  to the  EDITOR  of the  Pall 
Mall, I wrote a curt letter,  SPEAKING  ONLY  OF THE  MILITARY  CORRESPON­
DENCE,  i.e. I  simply asked whether  yes or no. 
Last Tuesday  the  General Council ordered  a thousand  COPIES  of 
the Address  to be run off.  Today  I expect  the  page proofs. 
The singing  of the  Marseillaise  in  France  is a  parody just like 
the whole  SECOND EMPIRE.  But the  dogd  at least feels that 'Partant 
pour la Syrie' 18 WOULD NOT DO.  In Prussia,  on the  other hand, such 
buffoonery  is not  necessary. 'Lord,  in Thee  is all my  trust', 19 sung 
by William  I, with Bismarck  on the  right  and  Stieber  on the  left, is 
the German Marseillaise  ! As in 1812 sqq. The  German philistine 
seems fairly enraptured,  now  that  he can  give free vent  to his 
innate servility.  Who  would have thought  it possible that  22  years 
after  1848 a  national  war in  Germany would  be  given such 
theoretical expression! 
Fortunately, this whole demonstration stems from  the  middle 
class.  The  working class, with  the  exception  of the  direct adherents 
of Schweitzer, takes  no  part  in it. And  fortunately,  the  WAR OF CLASSES

in both countries, France and Germany, is so far advanced that no 
war ABROAD can seriously turn back the wheel of history. 
By publishing the TREATY (on Belgium), Bismarck too has 
overstepped the mark.20  Even London RESPECTABILITY no longer 
ventures to talk of the integrity of Prussia. Macaire et Co.! 
Incidentally, shortly before 1866, I recollect reading articles in the 
organ of the worthy Brass" and in the Kreuz-Zeitung, in which 
Belgium was denounced as a 'nest of Jacobins' (!) and its 
annexation by France was recommended. On the other hand, the 
moral indignation of John Bull is no less comic! RIGHT  OF TREATIES! 
THE DEVIL! After all, it was Palmerston who made it a maxim of 
English policy that when you solemnly conclude a treaty, you do 
not necessarily swear to abide by it, and England has acted 
accordingly ever since 1830! ON ALL SIDES, nothing but war and 
immorality. 
Charming of the Kreuz-Zeitung to demand that England should 
refuse to supply the French with coal, i.e. that she should violate 
the Anglo-French commercial treaty, i.e. declare war on France. 21 
That coal can be a military commodity is a fact that was vividly 
brought home to Pamb  by the opposition at the time. He fobbed 
them off with bad jokes. So the point is one that was by no means 
overlooked when the treaty was concluded. Urquhart wrote fierce 
denunciations about it during the negotiations. So if England does 
not declare war de prime  abord c she must continue to supply the 
French with coal. As far as a declaration of war is concerned, that 
could produce some extremely serious ill-feeling between the 
POWERS THAT BE and the London proletariat. The mood of the 
workers here is DECIDEDLY against such ostentatious gestures.22 
At last a letter from the Russians in Geneva.23 I enclose it. 
Return it soon, SAY MONDAY NEXT,*1 since I have to reply. 
From the enclosed letter by E. Oswald (an Urquhartite, but 
relatively rationalised in a continental spirit), you can see that even 
the democrats wish to do something.15 I have written to hime that 
I have already signed an Address of the  INTERNATIONAL  which,  as far 
as the purely political aspect is concerned, puts forward essentially 
similar views. In further letters, yesterday and today, he insists that I 
should attend their MEETING in his house this afternoon. (He lives very 
near here.) He also sends me an extract from a letter by Louis Blanc.

MARX TO PAUL AND LAURA LAFARGUE25 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 28 July 1870 
My dear children, 
You must excuse the long delay of my answer. You know I 
cannot stand heat. It weighs down my energies. On the other 
hand, I was overwhelmed with business, the German 'friends' 
firing at me a mitrailleuse26 of letters which, under present 
circumstances, I could not decline answering at once. 
You want of course to hear something of the war. So much is 
sure that L. Bonaparte has already missed his first opportunity. 
You understand that his first plan was to take the Prussians 
unawares and get the better of them by surprise. It is, in point of 
fact, much easier to get the French army—a mere soldiers' army 
till now—ready than the Prussian one which consists largely of the 
civilian element forming the Landwehr. 11 Hence, if Bonaparte, as 
he at first intended, had made a dash even with half-collected 
forces, he might have succeeded to surprise the fortress of 
Mayence, to push simultaneously forward in the direction of 
Würzburg, thus to separate Northern from Southern Germany, 
and so throw consternation amidst the camp of his adversaries. 
However, he has allowed this opportunity to slip. He saw 
unmistakable signs of the national character of the war in 
Germany and was stunned by the unanimous, quick, immediate 
adhesion of Southern Germany to Prussia. His habitude of 
hesitation, so much adapted to his old trade of conspirator 

=====第47页=====
5. Marx to Paul and Laura Lafargue. 28 July 1870 13 
planning coup d'état and plebiscites, got the upper hand, but this 
method will not do for war, which demands quick and unwavering 
resolution. He let his first plan slip and resolved to collect his full 
forces. Thus he lost his advantage of a first start, of surprise, while 
the Prussians have gained all the time necessary for mobilising 
their forces. Hence you may say that Bonaparte has already lost 
his first campaign. 27 
Whatever may now be the first incidents of the war, it will 
become extremely serious. Even a first great French victory would 
decide nothing, because the French army will now find on its way 
three great fortresses, Mayence, Coblenz, and Cologne, ready for a 
protracted defence. In the long run, Prussia has greater military 
forces to her disposal than Bonaparte. It may even be that on one 
side or the other she will be able to cross the French frontier and 
make 'le sol sacré de la patrie'* —according to the chauvinists of the 
Corps Législatif this sol sacré is situated only on the French side of 
the Rhine—the theatre of war! 
Both nations remind me of the anecdote of the two Russian 
noblemen accompanied by two Jews, their serfs. Nobleman A 
strikes the Jew of Nobleman B, and B answers: 'Schlägst Du 
meinen Jud, schlag ich deinen Jud.' b So both nations seem 
reconciled to their despots by being allowed, each of them, to strike 
at the despot of the other nation. 
In Germany the war is considered as a national war, because it is a 
war of defence. The middle class (not to speak of the Krautjunker-
tumc) overdoes itself in manifestations of loyalty. One believes 
himself taken back to the times of 1812 sqq 'für Gott, König und 
Vaterland' d with the old donkey Arndt's: 'Was ist des Teutschen 
Vaterland' e! 
The singing of the Marseillaise at the bidding of the man of 
December is of course a parody, like the whole history of the 
Second Empire. Still it shows that he feels that 'Partant pour la 
Syrie' is would not do for the occasion. On the other hand, that old 
damned ass, Wilhelm 'Annexander', g sings 'Jesus meine Zuver­
sicht' 19; flanked on the one side by 'larron' h Bismarck and on the 
other, by the 'policier' Stieber! 
On both sides it is a disgusting exhibition.

Still there is this consolation, that the workmen protest in 
Germany as in France. In point of fact the war of classes in both 
countries is too far developed to allow any political war whatever 
to roll back for long time the wheel of history. I believe, on the 
contrary, that the present war will produce results not at all 
expected by the 'officials' on both sides. 
I enclose two cuts from Liebknecht's Volksstaat. You will see that 
he and Bebel behaved exceedingly well in the Reichstag. 28 
For my own part, I should like that both, Prussians and French, 
thrashed each other alternately, and that—as I believe will be the 
case—the Germans got ultimately the better of it. I wish this, 
because the definite defeat of Bonaparte is likely to provoke 
Revolution in France, while the definite defeat of the Germans 
would only protract the present state of things for 20 years. 
The English upper classes are full of moral indignation against 
Bonaparte at whose feet they have fawned for 18 years. Then they 
wanted him as the saviour of their privileges, of rents and profits. 
At the same time, they know the man to be seated on a volcano 
the which unpleasant position forces him to trouble peace 
periodically, and makes him—beside his parvenuship—an un­
pleasant bedfellow. Now they hope that to solid Prussia, protestant 
Prussia, Prussia backed by Russia, will fall the part of keeping 
down revolution in Europe. It would for them be a safer and 
more respectable policeman. 
As to the English workmen, they hate Bonaparte more than 
Bismarck, principally because he is the aggressor. At the same 
time they say: 'The plague on both your houses'," and if the 
English oligarchy, as it seems very inclined, should take part in the 
war against France, there will be a 'tuck' at London. For my own 
part, I do everything in my power, through the means of the 
International, to stimulate this 'neutrality' spirit and to baffle the 
'paid'  (paid by the 'respectables') leaders of the English working 
class who strain every nerve to mislead them. 
I hope the measures as to the houses within the fortification 
rayon will not hurt you.29 
Thousand kisses to my sweet little Schnaps.b

Dear  FRED, 
You will  see  from  the  enclosed that  so FAR the  Pall Mall business 
is quite satisfactory  and  your first article3 will appear this evening. 
The only reason  for  displeasure  is that MR Greenwood  (to  whom  I 
have  not yet  mentioned your name,  BY THE BY)  has  made  no 
reference to the  TERMS  even though  IN  MY FIRST  LETTER  TO HIM  I made a 
specific inquiry about them.17  On the  other hand, Thieblin  (i.e. 
Taran) said  to me on his  departure  for the  Continent  and at his 
LEAVETAKING  from  me  that payment  was  made  as a  matter  of course 
at the end of  each month. 
At all  events  it seems  to me  wisest  TO GO ON  for a few  more 
articles  so that  we  have  a firm case before issuing  an  OFFICIAL NOTE 
on this punctum} 1 
I went  to see  Smith  24 yesterday.  I learned there that  no one in 
London made inquiries about  you in  Manchester, because your 
LANDLORD  also  has a  SEAT  near Manchester  and  desired  to make  his 
own inquiry there. However,  it would  be  better  to write  to him 
and speed  the  matter  up. At all  events  I understand that  no  'third 
party'  has  intervened.

MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
[London,] 29 July 1870 
Dear LIBRARY,3 
Enclosed an extract from the Manifesto of the GENERAL COUNCIL 
taken from The Pall Mall Gazette of 28 July.b 
Be so good as to insert a note in your translation in the 
Volksstaat that you received the Manifesto in English.* 0 This will 
indicate to our other correspondents that we had no time to send 
them translations. 
Last Tuesday0 I translated the Reichstag protest of Bebel and 
yourself into English for the GENERAL COUNCIL. It was received with 
great acclamation.31 
One further matter. Mr Karl Blind made a patriotic speech to a 
German meeting in the Sports Hall; this comedian represented as 
a vital, world-shaking event the fact that he, the German Brutus, 
had suspended his republicanism, sacrificing it on the altar of the 
fatherland for the duration of the war. That was Act I. 
Act II: Karl Blind gives an account in his own hand in the 
London Deutsche Post of that same meeting, whose size, impor­
tance, etc., he exaggerates in his usual manner. 
Act III: Karl Blind writes an anonymous letterd  to The Daily 
News, in which he movingly depicts the overwhelming impact on 
the whole of Germany of the great speech made by Karl Blind at 
the meeting in the Sports Hall. All the German papers, he claims, 
have reproduced it. One of them, the Berlin Volks-Zeitung, even 
ventured (!) to print it in its entirety. (The fellow is a correspon­
dent of the Volks-Zeitung.) Neither did Viennese papers allow the 
great event to pass them by without trace. (The fellow sent in a 
report himself to the Neue Freie  Presse.*)

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 31 July 1870 
Dear Moor, 
Enclosed you will find the plan of the Prussian campaign.3 Please 
get a  CAB  immediately and take it round to The Pall Mall Gazette, so 
that it can come out on Monday evening. It will make me and the 
P.M.G. tremendously famous. By Tuesday matters may have 
developed to the point where any ass can figure the business out. I 
do not know whether my No. IIb appeared on Saturday as the 
P.M.G. has not reached the clubs here yet. I am building a fair 
amount on this business, as it really wasn't easy to guess the plan. 
The deciding factor was the news that a cousin of Gumpert's, a 
company commander in the 77th regiment, the vanguard of the 
7th Army Corps, set off from Aachen for Trier on 27 July. When 
I heard that everything fell into place. 
In addition, it is essential for you to arrange with Greenwood 
for me to send him the articles 12 direct, so that they can appear the 
same day. Delay is now fatal for articles of this sort. My idea is to 
send him an article twice a week on the average, more frequently 
if the matter is urgent, less often when there is a lull. In between I 
would send shorter notices when opportune, which he could make 
use of as he wished.

waging war under William.3 But it is still a good thing that he 
should be making himself so monstrously ridiculous with his 
divine mission and his Stieber, without whom German unity could 
hardly be achieved. The Address of the Internationalb was printed 
here on Saturday in the Tory Courier.0 Had it been another day of 
the week, the other papers would have published it too, but the 
Saturday advertisements were against it. The Address will teach 
the populus of all classes that nowadays the workers are the only 
ones to have a real FOREIGN POLICY. It is very good and it was 
certainly only because of the Russians that The Times declined to 
accept it.d Both the governments and the bourgeoisie will be 
greatly astonished after the war when they see how the workers 
simply resume their activities as if nothing had interrupted them 
at all. 
My confidence in the military achievements of the Germans 
grows daily. We really seem to have won the first serious 
encounter. The French do not yet appear to have properly 
grasped the potential of the breech-loader. 
Moltke's game is very audacious. On my calculations he will not 
be • ready with his troop concentrations before Tuesday or 
Wednesday^ From Aachen to the frontier is about 20 German 
miles,  i.e. 4-5 hard marches, especially in this heat. That means 
that the whole 7th Corps can scarcely be on the Saar before 
tomorrow, and the main battle may already take place today. At all 
events it is so FINELY CUT that 24 hours either way can make an 
enormous difference. The battle itself will probably be fought out 
on the Saar between Merzig and Saarbrücken. 32 
It is good that the French have attacked first on German 
territory. If the Germans follow on their heels after repelling an 
invasion, this will certainly not have the same effect in France as it 
would have done had they marched into the country without 
being invaded first. This means that on the French side the war 
will remain more Bonapartist in character. 
The ultimate success—i.e. a German victory—is quite beyond 
doubt in my view. However, Moltke's plan betrays his absolute 
assurance that he will have overwhelming superiority in the very 
first battle. We shall probably know by Tuesday evening whether 
he has not miscalculated. Moltke often reckons without his 
William.

The more the German philistine cringes before his William who 
trusts in God and cringes before Him, the more insolent he 
becomes towards France. The old pack is once again in full cry on 
the subject of Alsace-Lorraine—the Augsburger 3 in the lead. The 
peasants of Lorraine, however, will soon show the Prussians that 
the matter is not so easy. 
You are quite right about the treaty.15 People are not quite as 
stupid as Bismarck imagines. The only good thing about it is that 
the whole mess will now come out into the open and then there 
will be an end to all the duplicity of Bismarck and Bonaparte.20 
In the whole neutrality business, coal included,21 the Germans 
are acting like children, quite in accord with history. These are 
questions that have never faced the people. Who indeed has ever 
inquired about them? 
The Russians returned herewith.23 Once a Russian, always a 
Russian. What an idiotic piece of gossip-mongering. Six Russians 
quarrelling among themselves as if the mastery of the globe 
depended on the outcome. And it does not even include the 
accusations against Bakunin, merely their whining about cliquish-

so far as this is possible for a Russian; but I would still proceed 
cautiously with them. In the meantime it is quite good to know all

proletariat. 
Through the fault of the Post Office my copies of the Volksstaat 
arrive quite irregularly. The issue of the 23rd had a band round it 
with a post mark from the 19th  ; so that's the sort of trick they get 
up to. Many issues have not arrived at all. In the last two Wilhelm c 
was not very actively stupid; he was sheltering behind the

Anything additional must be newly formed by officers withheld 
from the field army or recalled to active service. At the same time 
the Garde mobile cannot be deployed in the field on its own for the 
next 2-3 months at the least, since it has only exercised 2 weeks a 
year since 1868. The units of the French army (of the line), on the 
other hand, are too small to be able to contain large numbers of 
untrained or under-trained reserves. The entire new system has 
only existed since 1868. Incidentally, I must await further 
information about this new system, which leaves the internal 
organisation of the French army almost entirely unchanged. It 
may be that all sorts of things are being done on the quiet. At any 
rate,  the units that have been trained only suffice to put the 
organised battalions of the line on a war-footing.

God-fearing monarchical Prussia. But the fellows should watch out. 
Ordinary people everywhere here are already saying: THAT  DAMNED 
GERMAN DYNASTY OF OURS WANTS FOR ITS FAMILY PURPOSES TO INVOLVE US IN THE 
CONTINENTAL WAR! 
The local Figaro, of which I have sent a typical issue to Dupont, 
is an English paper, founded by the French Embassy. 
Bismarck for his part has also assiduously bought up support in 
the London press, Lloyd's and Reynolds's3  among others! The latter 
in yesterday's issue calls for the DISMEMBERMENT  OF FRANCE. That swine 
ne ménage pas les transitions^ The fellow has always hurled abuse at 
the GERMANS and fawned upon the French and now he has suddenly 
changed into a sort of Blind. 
As to the latter chap, he hopes to achieve his election as deputy 
to the next Reichstag by means of a patriotic hubbub and by 
noisily 'suspending' his republicanism on the altar of the Father­
land. 
Oswald kept on at me until I finally went to the third MEETING 
fixed for yesterday.0 I took care to arrive a quarter of an hour 
early (the meeting was due to start at 11). I explained to him that I 
could not sign, 1.  d'abord d because I had already signed the 
Address of the INTERNATIONAL,' 2. because I could not sign a private 
Address (i.e. a non- International one) without you and they would miss 
the OPPORTUNITY due to the time required just for consultation with 
you. In the future, if an occasion presented  itself,  we would invite 
him and his friends to the International to take joint action. 
I then mentioned that there was a second, personal factor. If 
Louis Blanc was there, his FOOTMAN, Karl Blind, would surely be 
present too. 
He interrupted me: 'At the last MEETING here Blind mounted a 
furious chauvinistic diatribe. We need you against him.' 
'/ cannot remain in the same room as that character, and I must 
tell you that if he comes I shall leave your house at once.' 
I was downstairs in Oswald's study which looks out onto the 
street. Right enough! My EYEGLASS spied from afar the portentous 
ex-student, even though he had dyed his head black ALL OVER. He 
was accompanied by two fellow layabouts. Oswald said he would 
send them up to the DRAWING ROOM (the conference room) for the 
moment.

He then proposed to me that he would go up and say I was 
there and that I could not meet Blind. IN OTHER WORDS, he was 
going tO TURN HIM OUT. 
I said that would not do. He had invited Blind, there would be 
pointless scandal and so on. 
I took my hat and parted from Oswald on the most cordial 
terms.  Even if he didn't invent gun-powder, he is still a perfectly 
decent lad. 
At my prompting Serraillier wrote a blunt letter to Dupont 
about Mothet, so blunt that Dupont was insulted and stopped his 
correspondence with Serraillier for a fortnight. 
I would be glad if you could send me the money for the SEASIDE.3

circumstances I cannot go any further away from London.

MARX TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 16 
IN GENEVA 
[London,] 2 August 1870

Dear Becker, 
My long silence is to be explained exclusively by lack of time. I 
hope we know each other sufficiently well for us both to have the 
conviction that our friendship is steadfast.

I sent the Manifesto of the General Council on the war* to the 
Egalité in the first instance, because I knew that it came too late 
for the Vorbote. I expect to receive copies today which I can send 
on to you. 
In the translation of the programme for the congress (as it 
appears in the Vorbote), Jung made a number of mistakes: 
1: this must read: 'On the need to abolish the public  debt.  Discussion 
of the right to compensation.' 
2: 'On the relationship between the political action and the 
social movement of the working class.' 
4: 'Conversion of banks of issue into national banks.' 
5: 'Conditions of cooperative production on a national scale.' 
But all this you will find in the Volksstaat 38 
Furthermore, as far as the congress is concerned, it is perfectly 
obvious that it cannot be held in Mainz under present cir­
cumstances. The Belgians have proposed Amsterdam. We are 
convinced that the congress must be postponed until conditions are 
more favourable. 
In the first place, our support in Amsterdam rests on very 
feeble foundations and it is important to hold the congress 
in countries where the International has already sprung strong 
roots. 
Secondly, the Germans cannot send anyone—or no more than 
one person at best—thanks to the present lack of money 
occasioned by the war. The French cannot leave their country 
without passports, that is to say, without permission from the 
authorities. Our French sections have been dispersed, the most 
tried and tested members have either fled or been captured. In 
these circumstances we might easily see a repeat of the farce enacted 
in Switzerland.39  Certain intriguers might possibly stage-manage a 
majorité factice b in Amsterdam. They always manage to find the 
money necessary for such manoeuvres. Where from?  C'est  leur 
secret? 
On the other hand, the General Council is prevented by § 3 of 
the Rules from postponing the date of the  congress.  Nevertheless, in 
view of the present extraordinary circumstances, it would take the 
responsibility for such a step upon  itself,  if it could be sure of the 
necessary support from the sections.40 It would be desirable, 
therefore, if a reasoned motion to this effect could be proposed

officially by the German-Swiss group and the French-Swiss in 
Geneva. 
Bakunin, as you know, has in that blatherer Hins a fanatical 
instrument at his disposal in the Belgian General Council. As the 
Belgian secretariat was momentarily out of action, I added a 
denunciation and characterisation of Bakunin in my own name to 
the circular a which the General Council had issued on the Egalité, 
etc., at the beginning of January. Hins then wrote a highly 
impertinent letter to the General Council against me personally 
(he spoke of my 'manière indigne d'attaquer Bakunin' b), so I 
replied to him in the manner he deserved.17  It is doubtless thanks 
to his influence that, yesterday, we received an official communica­
tion full of accusations from the Belgian General Council, saying 
i.a.: 'The Belgian General Council has resolved to instruct its 
delegation to the next congress to call us to account for our 
resolution concerning the Conseil Federal Romand' c They say we 
had absolutely no right to interfere in these local Swiss affairs! 
Curiously enough, the Brussels people themselves, like the Paris 
'Fédération', had directly requested us to interfere! Memories are 
short! 
At all events, we shall now have to justify our decision in greater 
detail in our own circular. I would be greatly obliged to you, 
therefore, if you could give us a precise account of the intrigues of 
the ALLIANCE,10  the congress at La Chaux-de-Fonds 9 and the Swiss 
squabble in general. 
I have received the letter from our Russian friends in Geneva.23 
Please convey my thanks to them. 
In actual fact, the best thing would be for them to write a 
pamphlet on Bakunin, but it must be done soon. In that case they 
need not send me any further documents on Bakunin's machina­
tions. 
They ask me what Bakunin did in 1848. During his stay in Paris 
in 1843-48 he acted the determined socialist. After the revolution 
he went to Breslau, 0 teamed up with the bourgeois democrats there 
and agitated among them for the election of Arnold Ruge (to the 
Frankfurt Parliament), at that time a decided enemy of socialists 
and communists. Later—in 1848—he organised the Pan-Slavic 
Congress in Prague. 41 He was charged by the Pan-Slavists

Switzerland'. - b unworthy manner of attacking Bakunin - c K. Marx, 'General 
Council Resolution on the Federal Committee of Romance Switzerland'. - d Polish

themselves with having played a double game there. But I do not 
believe this. If he did make mistakes there (from the viewpoint of 
his Pan-Slavist friends), they were in my opinion 'involuntary 
ones'.  In early 1849 Bakunin issued an Address (pamphlet)— 
sentimental Pan-Slavism! a The only praiseworthy thing that can be 
reported about his activity during the revolution is his participa­
tion in the Dresden insurrection in May 1849.42 
Very important in any analysis of him are his utterances 
immediately after his return from Siberia.15  Ample material on this 
in the Kolokol and in Borkheim's 'Russian Letters' in the Zukunft, 43 
which I suppose you have. Tell our Russian friends that the 
person exposed by themc  has not made his appearance here, that 
I have passed on their message to Borkheim, and that I shall be 
very pleased to have one of them come over here. Lastly, I should 
be greatly obliged to them if they would send me the fourth volume 
of Chernyshevsky just published. I shall send them the money for it 
through the post. 
Your article on the war in the last Vorboted was very good, 
applauded by my whole FAMILY, who send you their most cordial 
greetings.

MARX TO EUGEN OSWALD 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 2 August 1870 
Dear Sir, 
I read in the Rappel of 1 August in a correspondence from 
Francfort-sur-Main of 27 juillet, the following, inter alia: 
The town is full of people who have been paid to sustain warlike and anti-French 
feeling...' (sic!). 'A letter addressed to the Frankfurter Zeitung from London contains, 
among other things, a highly interesting confession. Frenchmen living in London 
decided to issue a proclamation against this Napoleonic war and invited the principal 
German republicans likewise resident in London, to join them. The Germans are 
reported to have refused to take part in the protest on the grounds that the war was 
defensive on the German side.' 
This misleading report which thoroughly distorts the facts 
concerning the 'convocation'b issued by you, stems from  Blind,  the 
correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung.c 
I believe that a correction in the Rappel (Bureau de Rédaction, 18, 
Rue de Valois, Paris) will enable you best to achieve the effect you 
originally desired. 
Yours, 
K. Marx

Dear Moor, 
Enclosed are W/2  86721,  Manchester, 20 June 1869—£20; W/2

S/11 13062, Liverpool, 17 May 1869—£5 Moore's subscription to 
the International. You will receive mine early in September, I am 
RATHER SHORT OF CASH and must wait for dividends. Since I have to 
make some payments, I shall have to sell SHARES. What do you 
think: should I wait a while or do it right away? I can still sell 
without loss. 
I am very pleased to see that the French have advanced and 
occupied Saarbrücken (garrisoned by 1 battalion, 4 squadrons and 
perhaps some artillery). Firstly, for moral reasons. Secondly, 
because it means that the Germans will take up a defensive 
position in the first battle and a defensive position is enormously 
strengthened by the breech-loader. Since, on my reckoning, the 
Germans must have moved up into strategic positions yesterday 
evening, I assume that the battle, for which the introductory 
skirmishes are doubtless taking place today, will be fought 
tomorrow along the line Ottweiler-Neunkirchen-Homburg. The 
army of Frederick Charles and the Crown Prince a will keep the 
front busy while Steinmetz will fall on the (left) French flank. Or 
vice versa. 
That Greenwood did not publish the article1" until yesterday 
evening, when a mass of confirmation was already available, was 
very stupid.c He also made a number of absurd lexical changes 
which reveal his ignorance of military terminology. However, it 
has already had an effect. Today, The Times published a  LEADER 
which was copied straight out of my Articles II & III. So I am writing 
to Greenwood about it.45 
You would have received the money yesterday but your letter 
only came with the second post and I did not receive it until 
around 4 o'clock.

The joke about Blind  is very pretty.  Is Oswald  one of the  Baden 
Oswalds  of 1849? There were  3 of  them. 
There  is still a certain risk that  the  French will attack before  the 
Germans have fully drawn  up their troops.  If the  noble Louisa 
had attacked  on Friday,b  he could have  got as far as the  Rhine 
without much trouble.  But by  Tuesday  the  Germans must  be more 
or less ready.  His  best chance  of taking  the  offensive  was 
frustrated through  his own  fault—i.e.  by the bas empire, 46 by the 
JOBBERY  in the  army administration which delayed  him for 5  days  and 
has probably forced  him to  march  in before  he was  ready. 
If the  Germans lose this first battle, against  all expectation, they 
could still  be significantly stronger  in 4  weeks than they  are now. 
They  are  protected from absolute defeat  by the  Rhine;  the  French, 
however, have  no natural obstacle  to protect them. 
Be so good  as to let me  know  as soon  as you  receive  the money; 
even registered letters sometimes  go astray. Best greetings  to you

MARX  TO  ENGELS 1 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  3 August  1870 
DEAR FRED, 
The unfortunate Oswald  has  just left  a moment ago—7  p.m., 
and although  it is too  late  to catch  the  post,  I shall write  it all 
down since  I do not  know whether  I might  not be  prevented  by 
some diversion tomorrow. 
The fellow with Blind  was Prof.  Goldstücker,  an  old-time 
National Liberal.  The  scene became very stormy. 0 Student Blind 
even  lied,  asserting that  Dr Jacoby  was on his  side (this  was for 
the benefit  of the  Frenchmen present).  On  departing  the  fellows

let it be understood, not LITERALLY but by insinuation, that Oswald 
had been 'bought' by Bonaparte. 
This threw POOR Oswald into convulsions. So he came to me. / 
should sign TO BACK HIM. OTHERWISE, HIS POSITION IN LONDON WOULD BE 
DANGEROUSLY  DAMAGED.  He brought a printed copy of the Address with 
him (just the page proofs).15  I repeated to him  d'abord"  everything 
I had said previously. I then read the stuff through—feeble, 
verbose and—out of courtoisie to the Frenchmen negotiating with 
him—not a hint at the DEFENSIVE CHARACTER of the WAR on the part of 
the GERMANS  (to say  nothing  of PRUSSIA). 
I then proposed that he should drop the whole thing as its 
effect could not be 'great', since, as I had told him before, in my 
answer to his first letter,b the working class alone could offer active 
resistance to the national swindle. 
He answered:  d'abord,  a certain number of Frenchmen had 
already signed and Louis Blanc had declared that he would lend his 
name (a formula to indicate that he had had no part in composing 
the Address). 
Second, if he did not publish it now, Blind would write the next 
day in the German papers that he had prevented the publication of 
this treasonable Address. It would be better to print it. 
The last point is right. I must say that I felt sorry for the lad. So 
I gave him the following ultimatum: 
I too would lend my name (and, like Louis Blanc, not actually 
subscribe) on these two conditions: 
1. that a note would be printed under my name saying 
*'I agree with the above Address so far as its general sentiments 
coincide with the manifesto issued by the General Council of the 
"International Working Men's Association".'*0 
2. that a sentence was added hinting at the DEFENSIVE CHARACTER of 
the WAR on the GERMAN side, if only in the most unobtrusive and tactful 
manner. 
He accepted these conditions. The next day at 5 p.m. there would 
be another MEETING in his house, which I would attend. 
He then said: Would Engels not sign too with the same reservations 
as myself? 
I said it was a London Address. I was lending my name on certain 
conditions only out of courtesy to him and wholly against my critical 
judgment. I saw absolutely no reason why you too should 
compromise yourself because Oswald had made the mistake of 
a First of all. - b See this volume, p. 9. - c K. Marx, 'First Address of the General 
Council of the International Working Men's Association on the Franco-Prussian War'.

involving ex-student Blind in the affair at all. And there the matter 
was left. 
Incidentally, I had already written to Oswald since Sunday/ 
drawing his attention to another manoeuvre of Blind's.*5 1 had read in 
the Rappel a correspondent's report from Frankfurt (quite rational 
for a change) in which the author was very anti-chauvinistic for a 
Frenchman. Nevertheless, he remarks against the Germans that 
the Frankfurter Zeitung 11 had printed a correspondent's report from London 
according to which the 'French republicans in London had invited all known German 
republicans to join in a common protest contre  cette  guerre napoléonienne d.The German 
republicans had refused to do so because on the Prussian side the war was a defensive 
one.' 
This was the work of the ex-student who constantly writes of, to, 
for and about Karl Blind and his deeds of heroism.

Despite all the DRAWBACKS the Pall Mall has two advantages:

a certain opposition to Russia. This may become important as the war 
progresses. 
2. As the  GENTLEMEN'S  PAPER  par excellence  it sets the fashion in all the 
clubs, and particularly the military ones. 
3. It is the only non-venal paper in London.

basis for an Anglo-Russian alliance. (He conveniently forgot that the 
independence of Poland was a condition for that guarantee on 
England's part.47) This was just a FEELER THROWN OUT. But the 
Anglo-Russian alliance is actually planned by Gladstone too. The 
ENGLISH  MEMBERS  of the  INTERNATIONAL  really must take energetic action 
on this. I shall send a letter to the COUNCIL about it  FOR  NEXT TUESDAY.17 
The Belgians have proposed the congress be held in Amsterdam 
on 5 September. This is the plan of Mr Bakunin. The congress 
would consist chiefly of his  TOOLS.  I have proposed instead: *Appeal to 
all the sections whether they think not that, under present 
circumstances, where the French and German delegates would be 
excluded from the congress, power should be given to the General 
Council 
1. to postpone the congress; 
2. to enable the Council to convoke congress at the moment it shall 
consider opportune.* This was passed.4 
The matter was all the more pressing as we see from the open 
attack on us in the  LAST  Solidarité (using our decision on the Swiss 
matter as a pretext) 48 that Bakunin had taken all his precautionary 
measures for the Amsterdam Congress. He would have defeated us 
at the last  congress  in Basle,  had it not been for the German element in 
Switzerland.49 
Lopatin has moved to London from Brighton, where he was 
almost dying of boredom. He is the only 'reliable' Russian I have got 
to know up to now, and I shall soon succeed in driving his national 
prejudices out of him. I also learned from him that Bakunin had 
been spreading the rumour that I was an agent of Bismarck—mirabile 
dictu3 l And, c'est vraiment drôle, b the same evening (last Tuesday, 
yesterday), Serraillier told me that Châtelain, MEMBER  OF THE FRENCH 
BRANCH, 50 and a particular friend of Pyat, had even informed the 
FRENCH BRANCH IN FULL SITTING how much Bismarck had paid 
me—namely 250,000 francs. If, on the one hand, one is in the 
French habit of thinking in francs and if, on the other hand, one 
bears Prussian niggardliness in mind, then this is at least a very 
decent estimatel

IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 8 August 1870 
DEAR FRED, 
I shall not get away until tomorrow (I've been held back by 
BUSINESS for the INTERNATIONAL). I shall not be going to Brighton 
after all, but to Ramsgate, 53 since the former place turned out on 
inquiry to be too hot, and besides it is made unsafe by the 
presence of Arnold Winkelried Ruge. a 
L'Empire est fait, b i.e. the German Empire.  BY HOOK AND  by CROOK, 
neither in the way intended nor in the manner imagined, it 
appears that all the double-dealing since the SECOND EMPIRE began 
has finally combined to carry out the 'national' aims of 1848— 
Hungary, Italy and Germany! It seems to me that this sort of 
movement will only be complete when a brawl breaks out between 
the Prussians and the Russians. This is by no means improbable. The 
press of the Muscovite party (I have seen a good deal of it chez 
Borkheim) has attacked the Russian government just as savagely 
for its friendly attitude towards Prussia as the French papers 
sympathetic to Thiers attacked Boustrapa 54 in 1866 for his 
flirtation with Prussia. No one but the Emperor,c the German-
Russian party and the official St Petersburg  Journal1*  were sounding 
the bugle against France. But they did not at all expect 
Prussian-German successes on such a decisive scale. Like 
Bonaparte in 1866, they imagined that the BELLIGERENT  POWERS  would 
exhaust each other in protracted struggles, so that Holy Russia 
might then step in as supreme ARBITER. 
But now! Unless Alexander wants to be poisoned, SOMETHING  MUST 
BE DONE to appease the national party. The prestige of Russia will 
obviously be 'harmed' even more by a German-Prussian Empire 
than was the prestige of the 'SECOND EMPIRE' by the establishment of 
the North German Confederation.55 
So Russia will do just what Bonaparte did between 1866 and 
1870, namely, play tricks on Prussia in order to gain concessions

freedom against the Habsburgs. Used by Marx to deride Ruge. - b The Empire is

from Turkey, and despite the Russian religion of the Hohenzol-
lerns,  all this trickery will end in war between the  tricksters.  However 
gullible the German simpleton may be, his newly reinforced 
national sentiment (especially at the present time, when he is no 
longer to be persuaded that he must put up with all sorts of things 
in order to first establish German unity) will hardly allow him 
to be pressed into the service of Russia, for which there is no good 
reason, nor even a PRETEXT anymore. Qui vivra, verra. 3 If our 
handsome William b survives yet awhile, we may well live to see his 
proclamations to the Poles. As  OLD  Carlyle has said: when God 
wishes to accomplish something particularly great, his choice 
always falls on the most stupid people to carry it out. 
What gives me cause for anxiety at the present moment is the 
state of affairs in France  itself.  The next great battle can hardly 
but go against the French. And what then? If the defeated army 
makes for Paris under Boustrapa's leadership it will produce the 
most humiliating peace possible for France, perhaps ending in the 
restauration of the Orléans. If a revolution breaks out in Paris, it 
is questionable whether they will have the means and the leaders 
capable of offering serious resistance to the Prussians. One cannot 
remain blind to the fact that the 20-year-long Bonapartist farce 
has brought tremendous demoralisation in its wake. One would 
hardly be justified to rely on revolutionary heroism. What is your 
opinion? 
I understand nothing of military matters, but it is still my 
impression that rarely has a campaign been conducted in a more 
mindless, planless and mediocre manner than this campaign of 
Badinguet's.c And then, too, the beautiful opening scene with the 
whole Porte St Martind melodrama of the LOWER EMPIRE46 : the 
father and son at the flash-vent of the cannon, and the infamous 
deeds such as the bombarding of Saarbrücken with which this 
'sublime' scene is amalgamated! It's the man to a T! 
MacMahon pressed for swift action in the original war council in 
Metz, but Leboeuf was of the opposite point of view. 
Apropos! We have heard from Vienna (in a letter from a cousin 
of Eccarius, a 72-year-old man) that Bismarck was there on a secret 
visit! 
Quite in accordance with the spirit of the LOWER EMPIRE, we can 
see how in this war—in its commissariat and its diplomacy—

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN RAMSGATE 
Manchester, 10 August 1870 
Dear Moor, 
Today is 10 August. Can the Parisians have forgotten it 
completely? To judge from this evening's Pall Mall Gazette, it 
would seem not. 5 The bas empire 46 looks like dissolving in a fart. 
Badinguet3 is abdicating from the army and has to hand it over to 
Bazaine (!!) who is now the best man among those left undefeated. 
This means in reality that he is abdicating altogether. It seems that 
people are to have the revolution made very easy for them; 
everything is falling to pieces entirely of its own accord, as was to 
be expected. The next few days will surely decide the matter. 
I think that without the army the Orleanists are not strong 
enough to risk a restoration immediately. Since they are now the 
only possible dynasty left, it is conceivable that they might 
themselves prefer a republican interregnum again. In that event 
would the ex-Marseillaise59 come to power? 
I believe that faced with a republic the Prussians would agree to 
a peace on terms that would be honourable on the whole. It 
cannot be in their interest to stir up 1793 and 1794 all over again. 
The whole tenor of the King'sb  speech suggested that they were 
reckoning with a revolution and were unwilling to let things go to 
extremes. It is true that, against this, there has been since then the 
great national mania in Germany and the universal cry for 
Alsace-Lorraine. Nor can William be relied upon. But for the 
moment I still believe that they will settle for less. France will 
doubtless have to cede some territory. And for the élan of 1793 to 
be reborn, and effectively reborn—that calls for the enemies of 
1793 and, as you rightly say, it also calls for somewhat different 
Frenchmen than those who have just come from the bas empire. 
Incidentally, I would surmise that the Prussians have already 
held discussions with the Orléans. 
That Bismarck was in Vienna sounds like a local stock-market 
rumour to me. There is a lot of that about in Vienna.

42 21. Engels to Marx. 10 August 1870 
What you say about the Russians is my opinion exactly.3 And it 
won't be long before matters come to a head. I am convinced that 
in that event Bismarck will arrange things with the French in 
advance. 
On Badinguet's strategy there were articles yesterday (LEADER) 
and this evening in The Pall Mall Gazette* Since then still more 
follies discovered. The 7th Corps of Félix Douay only left Belfort 
on 1 August and began a leisurely march towards Altkirch. But 
now that the line Strasbourg-Nancy is, or is about to be, taken by 
the Germans near Zabern, c the corps will have to be sent to Metz 
or Chalons via Vesoul and Chaumont. Such a mess is unheard of. 
It is excellent that it should be the Germans to expose the whole 
swindle at a stroke! 
The letters published in the Temps since Sunday by Captain 
Jeannerodd  give the best idea of the conception of thé enemy 
prevailing in the French army. The good man was taken prisoner 
in Saarbrücken and saw the 8th Corps (our Rhinelanders). The 
fellow's amazement is enough to make you die laughing. The very 
first glimpse of the Prussian camp impressed him enormously. 
' Une belle et bonne armée, une nation fortement organisée pour la 
guerre' e—that is what he perceives in everything down to the 
Prussian N.C.O. whose 'valeur morale is 'malheureusement digne d'être 
enviée par  nouJ. 1 And he is one of the most intelligent of them and 
can himself speak good German! He admits, moreover, that the 
Prussians shoot far better than the French. 
The Germans now have IV4 million men under arms, so that 
even 100,000-200,000 Italians (=half that number of Frenchmen) 
make little difference. Austria risks a revolution in Vienna if she 
makes a move. Russia will doubtless feel SAFE until peace is 
concluded, or a revolutionary government has been established in 
Paris which cannot be relied on to enter into any double-dealing. 
Everyone will take good care not to irritate the enraged German 
simpleton still further. However, you can see how right I was in 
my belief that the Prussian military organisation contained 
tremendous power, a power completely invincible in a national 
war like this. 
Official accounts now refer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd German army.

The EMINENT WRITER who has caused this notice about himself to 
appear in The Daily News is of course none other than ex-student 
Karl Blind. This miserable wretch could really stir up a lot of 
trouble in the English press at this moment with his intrigues. 
Since you have some influence in the Pall Mall now, you must 
tear the rubbish to pieces as soon as it appears, and really flay the 
beast alive. 
Between ourselves, the Prussians could bring off a great diploma­
tic coup if—without demanding an inch of French soil for 
themselves—they were to insist on the return of Savoy and Nice 
to Italy and of the territory neutralised by the 1815 treaties to 
Switzerland.63 No one could raise any objections to that. However, 
it is none of our business to offer advice on these territorial 
exchanges. 
The family is amusing itself here royally. Tussy and Jennychen 
never come out of the sea and are building up a good stock of 
health. For my part, I am lying more or less fallow thanks to the 
rheumatism and the sleepless nights.

How far Bracke, who is certainly a very weak fellow, has allowed 
his national enthusiasm to run away with him I cannot tell, and as 
I receive at most one issue of the Volksstaat every fortnight, I am 
also unable to judge the position of the Committee a in this regard 
except from Bonhorst's letter to Wilhelm, which on the whole is 
COOL, but betrays theoretical uncertainty. In contrast with this, 
Liebknecht's narrow-minded and self-confident dogmatism un­
doubtedly shows up, very favourably as usual. 
The case seems to me to be as follows: Germany has been 
driven by Badinguetb  into a war for her national existence. If 
Badinguet defeats her, Bonapartism will be strengthened for years 
and Germany broken for years, perhaps for generations. In that 
event there can be no question any more of an independent 
German working-class movement either; the struggle to restore 
Germany's national existence will absorb everything, and at best 
the German workers will be dragged in the wake of the French. If 
Germany wins, French Bonapartism will at any rate be smashed, 
the endless row about the establishment of German unity will at 
last be over, the German workers will be able to organise on a 
national scale quite different from that prevailing hitherto, and 
the French workers, whatever sort of government may succeed 
this one, are certain to have a freer field than under Bonapartism. 
The whole mass of the German people of every class have realised 
that this is first and foremost a question of national existence and 
have therefore at once flung themselves into the fray. That in 
these circumstances a German political party should preach total 
abstention à la Wilhelm and place all sorts of secondary 
considerations before the main one, seems to me impossible. 
To this must be added that Badinguet would never have been 
able to wage this war without the chauvinism of the mass of the 
French population: the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, the 
peasants and the imperialistic, Haussmannist building-trade pro­
letariat stemming from the peasants, which Bonaparte created in 
the big towns. 65 Until this chauvinism is knocked on the head, and 
knocked good and proper, peace between Germany and France is 
impossible. One might have expected a proletarian revolution to 
take this work over, but since the war is already on there is no 
choice for the Germans but to attend to the job themselves and 
quickly.

Now come the secondary considerations. For the fact that 
Lehmann, 3 Bismarck & Co, are in command in this war and that it 
must minister to their temporary gloire if they conduct it 
successfully, we have to thank the miserable state of the German 
bourgeoisie. It is certainly very unpleasant, but cannot be altered. 
But to magnify anti-Bismarckism into the sole guiding principle on 
that account would be absurd. In the first place, now, as in 1866, 66 
Bismarck is doing a bit of our work, in his own way and without 
meaning to, but all the same he is doing it. He is clearing the deck 
for us better than before. Moreover it is no longer the year 1815. 
The South Germans are now bound to enter the Reichstag and 
this will develop a counterweight to Prussianism. Then there are 
the national duties which devolve on him and which, as you wrote, 
forbid the Russian alliance from the outset. In general it is 
senseless to try à la Liebknecht to set back the clock of history on 
all that has happened since 1866, just because it is not to his 
liking. But we know our model South Germans. There is nothing 
to be done with these fools. 
I think our people can: 
1) join the national movement—you can see from Kugelmann's 
letter how strong it is67—insofar and for so long as it is limited to 
the defence of Germany (which does not exclude an offensive, in 
certain circumstances, until peace is attained); 
2) at the same time emphasise the difference between German 
national and dynastic-Prussian interests; 
3) oppose any  ANNEXATION  of Alsace and Lorraine—Bismarck is 
now intimating an intention of annexing them to Bavaria and 
Baden; 
4) as soon as a non-chauvinistic republican government is at the 
helm in Paris, work for an honourable peace with it; 
5) constantly stress the unity of interests between the German 
and French workers, who did not approve of the war and are also 
not making war on each other; 
6) Russia, as in the Address of the International.11 
Amusing is Wilhelm's assertion that because Bismarck is a 
former accomplice of Badinguet's the correct position would be to 
remain neutral. If that were the general opinion in Germany, we 
should soon have the Confederation of the Rhine68  again and the 
noble Wilhelm should see what sort of role he would play in that, 
and what would become of the workers' movement. A people that

gets nothing but kicks and blows is indeed the right one to make a 
social revolution, above all in the innumerable small states so 
beloved of Wilhelm! 
How nice of the poor little fellow to seek to call me to account 
for something that was 'supposed' to have been in the Elberfelder 
Zeitungl69 Poor animal! 
The débâcle in France seems to be frightful. Everything 
squandered, sold, swindled away. The chassepots 70 are badly made 
and misfire in action; there are none left of them and the old 
flintlocks have got to be hunted out again. Nevertheless a 
revolutionary government, if it comes soon, need not despair. But 
it must abandon Paris to its fate and carry on the war from the 
South. There would then still be a possibility of its holding out 
until arms have been bought and new armies organised which 
would gradually force the enemy back to the frontier. This would 
really be the true end of the war, both countries reciprocally 
furnishing proof that they are unconquerable. But if this does not 
happen quickly the game is up. Moltke's operations are a 
model—old William seems to give him a perfectly free hand—and 
the fourth battalions are already joining the army, while the 
French ones are not yet in existence. 
If Badinguet is not out of Metz yet it may go badly with him. 
Sea-bathing is no good for rheumatism. But Gumpert, who is 
spending four weeks in Wales, maintains that sea air is particularly 
wholesome. I hope you will soon be relieved of your pain. It's 
something terrible. At any rate it's not dangerous and the 
restoration of your general health is much more important.

You can see, incidentally, how the wretched Wilhelm constantly 
flirts with the reactionary particularists 71—Wulster, Obermüller, 
etc., and drags the Party in with him. 
Wilhelm has obviously counted on Bonaparte's victory, simply in 
the hope that it would finish off his dear Bismarck. You recollect 
how he always threatened him with the French. And it goes

IN RAMSGATE 
Manchester, 15 August 1870 
Dear Mrs Marx, 
Today I was at the bank I had given to Smith as a reference and 
I heard there by chance that he had finally condescended to ask 
for information. What he found out (namely, that the bank would 
guarantee ten times the sum concerned, if it were required) will 
doubtless satisfy him. 24 I suppose I shall now hear from him soon. 
I am very glad that I do not have to write first to that stupid 
aristocrat of a LANDLORD whose SEAT near Bolton seems to be a 
diminutive affair in the middle of the factory smoke. The fellow is 
obviously off shooting GROUSE on the moors nearby and will 
certainly be in just the mood to enter into business correspon­
dence with TENANTS. The ass obviously wanted to make himself feel 
important. 
In view of the present situation in France, where everything 
may be overturned any day—and probably will be in a week or 
two—it is of course risky to take a house and furnish it for 3 V2 
years.  However, it is a risk that must be taken. It seems to me that 
the Orleanists now want an interim republic like that of 1848 
directed by themselves, in the hope that such a republic would 
suffer the obloquy of having to conclude a peace, thus ensuring 
that the Crown would go to their Orléans as the only possible 
dynasty left. However, this strategy can easily misfire. 
The worst thing is: who could possibly take over leadership of a 
genuine revolutionary movement in Paris? Rochefort is the most 
popular and the only suitable man—Blanqui seems to be 
forgotten. 
That Barbes is dead is a blessing. The 'Beard of the Party' 
would spoil everything again. Enfin, nous verrons. 3 
I have been very lucky with my articles.b Some few little 
prophecies which I made at a moment when they were certain, 
appeared in the press in time, so that they could be confirmed by 
the news the next morning. Such things are pure luck and impress 
the philistines enormously.

Who wrote the article that appeared recently under the name of 
'von Thunder-ten-Tronckh' in which the English philistines were 
so bluntly told the truth?73  In general, it is remarkable what 
tremendous qualities the English are suddenly able to discover in 
the Germans, and how they are all at Bonaparte's throat, having 
lain in the dust at his feet only four weeks ago. There is no 
greater rabble than the honnêtes gens.* 
Unfortunately, I have no time to write to Tussy today; would 
you please tell her that I shall be writing to Kugelmann in the 
next few days and shall enclose the relevant material. 74

1) from the Address of the International," which he of course first 
translated into his own, Wilhelminian language; 
2) from the fact that I approved his and Bebel's statement in 
the Reichstag.31  That was a 'moment' when harping on principles 
was un acte de courage? but it by no means follows that the 
moment still continues, much less that the attitude of the German 
proletariat toward a war which has become national is com­
prehended in Wilhelm's antipathy to the Prussians. It would be just 
as if we were to object to the relative independence which Italy 
received as a result of this war merely because at a suitable 
moment we had raised our voices against the 'Bonapartist' 
liberation of Italy. 
The lust for Alsace and Lorraine seems to predominate in two 
circles: the Prussian camarilla and the South-German beer-patriots. 
It would be the greatest misfortune that could befall Europe and 
above all Germany. You will have seen that most of the Russian 
newspapers are already talking of the necessity of European 
diplomatic intervention in order to maintain the balance of power 
in Europe. 
Kugelmann confuses a defensive war with defensive military 
operations. 0 So if a fellow falls upon me in the street I may only 
parry his blows but not KNOCK him DOWN, because then I should 
turn into an aggressor! The WANT of dialectics peeps out of every 
word these people utter.

GROUSE-SHOOTING ARISTOCRAT. I was supposed to be there in 4 weeks, yet it 
was 5 weeks yesterday since I reached agreement with Smith and 
there is still no answer! 
I think that the ANNEXATION of the French Germans is as good as 
settled. If a revolutionary government had been formed in Paris as 
late as last week something still might have been done about it. 
Now, however, it comes too late and can only make a fool of itself 
by parodying the Convention. I am convinced that Bismarck 
would have settled for a peace without cession of territory with a 
revolutionary government if it had come on the scene in time. But 
the way France is behaving now he has no reason to resist the 
pressures from without and his vanity from within. It is a great 
pity, but it seems to me inevitable. If Germany were a state like 
France, it would be easier to find excuses. But as things stand, 
with the need to divide the conquered territory between the three 
neighbouring countries, it is ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is 
the fact that the Germans should be willing to lumber themselves 
with a German-speaking Venetia in the West.77 I shall try to obtain 
the ponderous Blind's weighty pamphlet, but it will likely as not 
come too late." 
What do you think of Mack-Bazaine? Mac-Mahon was bad 
enough, but now we shall have Mack (of Ulm) —tout court? It will 
be an unheard-of thing if 120,000 Frenchmen have to lay down 
their arms, and that will doubtless be the result. 78 Just imagine that 
old mule Williamc deflowering la pucelled  of Metz in his old age! 
There has never been such a dégringolade* as the one now 
displayed by the 2nd Empire. I am only curious to see whether the 
Parisians will not finally muster the energy to do something when 
they learn the truth about the events of this last week. 79 Not that it 
would be of any use any more. The demolitions undertaken 
around Paris to facilitate its defence are on such a colossal scale 
that I cannot believe they have been carried out properly. The 
population of the city has almost trebled since 1840 and the 
difficulties of provisioning it likewise. And finally, all traffic relies 
so greatly on the railway now that if a few bridges are blown up 
on every line it will be almost impossible to bring any supplies 
worth mentioning into the city, even if the blockade is not 
complete. 
a See this volume, p. 45. - b  just that; Engels is referring here to Bazaine who 
allowed himself to be shut up with his army and besieged in Metz, and suggesting a

The losses of the last few weeks must be enormous. Throughout 
the entire war the Germans have used bayonets with the greatest 
determination. And now they have been deploying cavalry against 
unflinching infantry so that men must have been falling like flies. 
The handsome William3 has made no mention of all this. But this 
much is certain: man for man and battalion for battalion, the 
Germans have proved their most decisive superiority over the 
French. First at Spicheren32 where they had 27 battalions against 
(at least) 42 French battalions which were occupying an almost 
impregnable position. After Thursday's battle80 it will be almost 
impossible to restrain the demoralisation in the French camp.

Now I shall briefly answer the questions in your various letters. 
Hume was empowered to carry on propaganda among the 
Yankees, but has exceeded his powers. I shall submit the matter 
to the General Council next Tuesday, with an EXHIBITION of his 
'cards'. 86 
As for the 'secretaryship' for the UNITED  STATES,  the matter is as 
follows: I am secretary for the German BRANCHES over there, 
Dupont for the French, and lastly Eccarius for the Yankees and the 
English-speaking part of the branches. In our public DECLARATIONS, 
therefore, Eccarius figured as 'SECRETARY FOR THE UNITED STATES'. 
Otherwise we should have to employ useless circumlocutions. I, 
for instance, would also have to sign as 'Secretary for the Russian 
branche' in Geneva, and so on. Moreover, Eccarius himself plainly 
set forth the state of affairs in a New York  PAPER—in  connection 
with Cluseret. 87 
Next week I shall send you a new pack of  CARDS  OF MEMBERSHIP. 
The lamentable behaviour of Paris during the war—still 
allowing itself to be ruled by the mamelukes of Louis Bonaparte 
and of the Spanish adventuress Eugénie 3 after appalling defeats— 
shows how much the French need a tragic lesson in order to 
regain their manhood. 
What the Prussian jackasses do not see is that the present war is 
leading just as inevitably to a war between Germany and Russia as 
the war of 186666 led to the war between Prussia and France. This 
is the best outcome that I expect from it for Germany. 'Prussianism' 
as such never has existed, and never can exist, except in alliance 
with and in subjection to Russia. And such a war No. 2 will act as 
the midwife of the inevitable social revolution in Russia. 
I regret that some misunderstanding on the part of my friend 
Vogt which is incomprehensible to me has led to a wrong opinion 
regarding Schily. 88 Schily is not only one of my oldest and most 
intimate personal friends; he is one of the ablest, most courageous, 
and most reliable members of the Party.

Arrived here the evening before last. Today I shall go to see 
Dr Maddison. 
Yesterday evening the enclosed note came from The Pall Mall 
Gazette together with a CHEQUE. Should I endorse the latter on 
your behalf and send it to Manchester, or cash it and send 
banknotes? 
After the spectacular confirmation of your first article on 
MacMahon91 it would be a good moment to begin your next 
article with a summary of your own Notes on the War}2 As you 
know, the English need to have their noses rubbed in the 'POINTS',

In my view the entire DEFENCE of Paris is nothing but a police 
farce, put on to keep the Parisians happy until the Prussians are 
standing at the gates, ready to restore order, viz., the dynasty and 
its mamelukes. 
The wretched spectacle which Paris presents at this moment, 
and I mean by that throughout the entire war, shows that France 
had to be taught a tragic lesson if she was to be saved. 
The declaration that no one can defend his 'fatherland' except 
in a uniform is an authentic piece of Prussianism]

history that it is not possible to achieve 'eternal' security from a 
defeated enemy through DISMEMBERMENT, etc. And even after the loss

of Alsace-Lorraine, France will not be battered as badly  BY FAR as 
Prussia was by Napoleon's horse-cure at Tilsit. 92 And how much 
did Napoleon I benefit from that? It just helped Prussia onto her 
feet again. 
I do not believe that Russia has actively intervened in this war 
up to now. I don't believe that she is prepared for such 
intervention, but it is a diplomatic master coup for her to have 
proclaimed herself France's SAVIOUR already at this stage.93 
In my detailed reply to the Brunswick Committee3  I have once 
and for all abolished the fulsome 'identity' of interests between 
him and myself which our Wilhelm b invents to others whenever it 
suits his purposes. It is a good thing that his initiative should have 
given me the opportunity to make an official statement for once 
about this malentendu 0 fostered by him so intentionally and with a 
bad conscience. 
What do you think of Freiligrath as a family poet? Even 
historical catastrophes like the present one do no more than 
provide an opportunity for him to extol his own BRATS. In the 
process the VOLUNTEER 'medical orderly' is transformed into a

MARX TO SIGFRID MEYER

London, 2 September 1870 
1 Maitland Park Road, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Meyer, 
Just a few lines in great haste (if I am to catch die post). I shall 
write to you more fully next week. I came back yesterday from the 
seaside where the doctors had sent me for my health 53 but where 
a violent and painful attack of SCIATICA bent me double for weeks 
on end. 
The first thing I did on my return was to reply to a pile of 
letters waiting for me; among my letter-creditors was Sorge, with 
half a dozen letters. Your letter had been mislaid and I only 
received it after sending off my reply to Sorge, 3 so I was unable to 
modify that in the light of the information contained in your 
letter.* 5 
In any case I simply had to write to Sorge because he had sent 
me newspapers and LABOR STATISTICS (Massachusetts) 1", ditto infor­
mation about Hume of use to the General Council, together with 2 
SAMPLES of the International cards, etc., he had produced.86  Lastly, I 
could not under any circumstances permit friend Vogt's erroneous 
view of Schily —one of my oldest and most intimate friends—to 
stand uncorrected. 88 
I was delighted to see from Sorge's last letter that you were 
being sent as a delegate to Cincinnati.89 
If the German Workers' Union has nominated other correspon­
dents this FACT should be reported to me officially for communica­
tion to the General Council. 
Salut et fraternité. 
Yours,

My Emperor, my Emperor a captive!a 
World history is surely the greatest of poets; it has even

and poor William c stands by and assures everybody for the

business and that it is purely the will of God! William really is just 
like the schoolboy: 'Who created the world?' 'Please, teacher, I 
did—but I won't ever do it again!' 
And then that wretch Jules Favre comes along with the proposal 
that Palikao, Trochu and a few Arcadians 7 should form a 
government. There has never been such a band of  riff-raff.  But 
all the same, when this becomes known in Paris we must expect 
something or other to happen. I cannot believe that this flood of 
news,  which is bound to become known today or tomorrow, will 
fail to produce its effect. Perhaps a government of the gauched 
which, after a show of resistance, will conclude peace.

As soon as Bazaine capitulates, which will likely as not happen 
this week,98 half the German army will march on Paris and the 
other half across the Loire to sweep the country clean of all armed 
units. 
On the subject of my articles,12 you will have seen that I did 
what was necessary in the one that appeared the day before 
yesterday.3 But my worst enemy in the English press is MR 
Greenwood  himself.  The fool regularly cuts out all the taunts I 
make about his competitors' plagiarisms, and what is even better, 
in his Epitome he excerpts the articles copied from mine the 
previous night with the greatest good humour and without even 
allowing himself a jibe about their plagiarism. The trouble is that 
the fellow cannot refrain from indulging his private passion for 
his own military opinion, which is pure nonsense. Every philistine 
regards the ability to ride as a matter of honour, and understand­
ing strategy comes into the same category. But even that is not 
enough to satisfy him. A few days ago he inserted a few utterly 
absurd lines about the siege of Strasbourg—simply in order to fill 
up the column. At the first opportunity I shall write an article on 
the same subject and say the exact opposite.99 But what can one 
say? Journalism in peacetime is nothing but a continual process of 
reasoning about things which one has not learned about, and so I 
have no real right to complain. 
Cash the CHEQUE yourself and keep the money.b Half belongs to 
you by rights and the other half is an advance on the next 
payment when I shall send you a further £70. 
The Alsace swindle—apart from its pristine Teutonic features— 
is mainly of a strategic nature and aims at getting the line of the 
Vosges and German Lorraine as border territory. (Language 
frontier: if you draw a straight line from Donon or Schirmeck in 
the Vosges to one hour's travelling east of Longwy where the 
Belgian-Luxembourg and French frontiers meet, that is almost the 
exact place: from Donon along the Vosges to the Swiss frontier.) 
Northwards from Donon the Vosges are actually not so high and 
steep as in the south. Only the jackasses of the Staats-Anzeiger and 
Brass & Co. could get the notion that France will be 'throttled' by 
the snipping off of this narrow strip with its IV4 million or so 
inhabitants. The hysterical demands of the philistines for 'guaran­
tees' are altogether absurd, but they tell because they suit the book 
of the people at Court.

I have not yet read the great medical-orderly poem.a It must be 
great. Moreover, these medical orderlies are the greatest loafers; 
when they are needed they are never on hand, but they stuff 
themselves, booze and bluster to such an extent that everyone in 
the army is fed up with them. Only a few exceptions. 
In Saarbrücken the French did as much damage as they could. 
Of course the bombardment lasted only a few hours and not, as in 
Strasbourg, day and night for weeks. 
Herewith returning Cacadou'sb  letter with thanks. Very interest­
ing. The defence of Paris will be an entertaining episode, if 
nothing out of the way happens inside. These perpetual little 
PANICS on the part of the French—all of which arise from fear of 
the moment when they will at last have to learn the truth—give 
one a much better idea of the Reign of Terror. We take this to 
mean the rule of people who inspire terror. On the contrary, it is 
the rule of people who themselves are terror-stricken. La terreur 
implies mostly useless cruelties perpetuated by frightened people 
in order to reassure themselves. I am convinced that the blame for 
the Reign of Terror in 1793 lies almost exclusively with the 
bourgeois frightened out of their wits and setting out to comport 
themselves like patriots, with the small philistines crapping their 
trousers, and with the mob of the underworld who knew how to 
coin profit from the terreur. These are the very classes active in the 
present minor terreur too.

few days.  His  chief purpose  is to  arrange matters with  the

to propose that this evening. Please could you send me as soon as

Do you not think that if the weather, which is said to be 
abominable in France at the moment, continues like this, as is very 
probable after the unusually long drought that has preceded it, 
the Prussians will have good 'cause' to listen to reason, especially as 
the Anglo-Russo-Austrian alliance is threatening? 
Dupont, who used to correspond with Pigott, ought to write the 
swine an abusive letter in the name of the French republicans.

Dear Moor, 
(Continuation.)a  Due to the unexpected victories chauvinism has 
gone horribly to the heads of the German philistines who have 
done nothing to bring them about, and it is high time to do 
something about this. If only the Volksstaat were not so 
contemptible! But nothing can be done about that. By the time my 
preface to The Peasant War h in pamphlet form appears in print, it 
will have been long since overtaken by events. All the more urgent, 
therefore, is the new proclamation of the International0 (for which 
you must do the German as well this time). 
If the telegraphed version of the Parisian International procla­
mation 101 is anything near accurate, it undoubtedly shows that 
these people are still entirely dominated by rhetoric. Having 
endured Badinguetd for 20 years, having been unable to prevent

him from winning 6 million votes against ll/2 only six months 
ago104  and from stirring them up against Germany without any 
rhyme or reason, now that the German victories have made them 
a present of a republic— et laquelle! 3—these people demand that 
the Germans should leave the sacred soil of France without delay, 
for otherwise there will be guerre à outrance h ! It is the same old 
idea of the superiority of France, of a land consecrated by 1793 
which no subsequent French indecencies can profane, of the 
sanctity of the word: the Republic. Such behaviour really does put 
me in mind of the Danes in 1864 105 who allowed the Prussians to 
approach to within 30 paces, fired a salvo at them and then laid 
down their arms in the hope that they would not be repaid in kind 
for the formality. 
I hope that they will all reflect on the matter once more when 
the first intoxication is past, for if not, it will be damned difficult 
to have any truck with them at an International level. 
The entire republic, like its pacific origin, has been a complete 
farce up to now. As I have expected for the past two weeks and 
even longer,0  the Orleanists want an interim republic to conclude 
the shameful peace, so that the ONUS will not fall on the Orléans 
who are to be restored subsequently. The Orleanists have the 
real power: Trochu the military command and Kératry the po­
lice; the gentlemen of the gauche d have the hot-air portfolios. 
Since the Orléans are now the only possible dynasty, they can 
wait calmly for the right moment for the real avènement au pou­
voir.' 
Dupont has just left. He spent the evening here and was furious 
about this beautiful Paris proclamation. He was reassured to hear 
that Serraillier will go there having had prior discussions with you. 
His views on the case are perfectly clear and accurate: make use 
of the freedoms inevitably granted by the republic to organise the 
party in France; act when occasion presents  itself,  once organisa­
tion has been completed; the International to be held on a leash in 
France until after peace has been concluded. 
The gentlemen of the Provisional Government and the 
bourgeois in Paris appear to know full well (to judge by the 
reports in The Daily News) that any ideas of continuing the war 
are just idle talk. The rain will hardly hold up the Germans at all; 
the men in the field are used to it by now and healthier for it than 
they would be in the heat. Of course there could be epidemics,

especially with the capitulation of Metz, where they will probably 
have broken out already, though it is not certain. A guerrilla war 
which would force the Prussians to order mass shootings does not 
seem very likely either, but it could break out here and there 
under the initial impact of revolution. As soon as we know what 
effect the capitulation of Metz will have in Paris (and it must 
happen next week at the latest), 96 we shall be in a better position to 
predict the further development of the war. Up to now, the 
measures, i.e. phrases, of the new rulers seem to promise little but 
a forthcoming surrender. 
Rochefort will probably not remain with that mob for long. 
When the Marseillaise reappears things will quickly come to a head 
between him and them. 
Schorlemmer left today with Wehner to bring a mass of spirits, 
wine, woollen blankets, flannel shirts, etc. (for over £1,000 in all) 
from the local Aid-Committee106  directly through Belgium to 
Sedan for the wounded. If he has time, he will call on you, but 
they still have a heap of things to attend to there; they did not 
start buying things and parcelling them up until yesterday 
morning. From there, they intend to go on to Metz, if possible, 
where each of them has a brother with the army. 
It is typical of the lousy government in Paris that they do not 
venture to tell the public the true facts of the present situation. I 
fear that unless there is a miracle, there will have to be a phase of 
direct bourgeois rule under the Orleans to allow the struggle to 
proceed in its pure form. To sacrifice the workers now, would be 
strategy à la Bonaparte and MacMahon; before peace they cannot 
act under any circumstances, and after that they will first need 
time to organise. 
The threat of the alliance3 will doubtless bring pressure to bear 
on the Prussians. But they know that the Russian breech-loaders 
are good for nothing, that the English have no army and that 
the Austrians are very weak. In Italy Bismarck with the 
Popeb (since the Florentine government has officially announced it 
will go to Rome in September), and with the consent of Nice and 
Savoy, appears to have made any resistance by the ruling circles 
impossible; it was a brilliant coup. Incidentally, Bismarck seems 
only to be waiting for some pressure to declare himself satisfied 
with money and the town of Strasbourg and its environs. He can

Dear FRED, 
You and Dupont must forgive me for answering so late and 
then only in a few lines. I am OVERWHELMED with political BUSINESS. 
You can see from the enclosed pieces of imbecility from 
opposite places—one from Paris, the other from Brunswick—just 
how pleasant our task is made for us. 
You know that I sent instructions to Brunswick.3 I assumed— 
mistakenly—that I was not dealing with uncouth BABIES, but with 
educated people who must be aware that the brutal language of a 
letter is not designed 'for printing', and furthermore that 
instructions have to contain confidential hints that are not intended 
to be revealed in the blare of publicity.  WELL!  These jackasses not 
only print 'word-for-word' extracts from my letter. They point 
their pitchforks at me, identifying me as the author. And they 
print sentences, such as the one about 'shifting the centre of 
gravity of the continental labour movement from France to 
Germany', etc., which were intended to spur them on, but which 
were not to be published now under any circumstances.107 I 
suppose I must be grateful to them at least for not having 
published my criticism of the French workers. And to cap it all the 
fellows even sent their compromising mishmash  IN HOT HASTE— to

I shall really tell them a few home truths, but the damage is 
done! On the other hand, there are the fools in Paris! They have 
sent me piles of their absurd chauvinistic manifesto101 which the 
English workers here greeted with derision and indignation that I 
had the greatest difficulty in preventing from being expressed 
publicly. I am supposed to send the thing to Germany en masse, 
probably to prove the Germans that they first have to 'withdraw 
across the Rhine' before they arrive homel And furthermore, 
instead of writing a rational answer to my letter,17  the fellows take 
the liberty of sending me instructions by telegraph (instructions 
from ex-student Longuet!) on how I must set about agitating in 
Germany  I Quel malheur!* 
I have set everything in motion here for the workers to force 
their government to recognise the French Republic.108 (The series 
of MEETINGS begins on Monday.b) Gladstone WAS WILLING ENOUGH at first. 
But the Queen0 was under Prussian instructions and there was also 
the oligarchic part of the CABINET!

ENGELS TO MARX 109 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 12 September 1870 
Dear Moor, 
Our friends over there—both in France and Germany—do 
indeed surpass each other in political adroitness. Those jackasses 
in Brunswick! They were afraid you would resent it if they 
tampered with the guidelines you had given them, so they printed 
them as they stood.107 The only awkward thing in reality is the 
passage about shifting the centre of gravity. To have printed that 
was an unprecedented piece of tactlessness. However, it is to be 
hoped that the Parisians have more urgent concerns now than to 
devote themselves to the study of this manifesto, particularly since 
they do not understand German. Their German in the proclama­
tion is beautiful. And in his paper3  Wilhelm b is full of praise for 
this chauvinistic mishmash. 11 Longuet is another fine one. Just 
because William I has presented them with a republic, a revolution 
should break out without delay in Germany. So why did they not 
make a revolution after the one in Spain? 111 
The passage on Alsace-Lorraine from the manifestoc  is printed 
in today's Zukunft, but as something emanating from the Brunswick-
ers. Send me 2 or more copies of the new Address as soon as it is 
ready. 
If anything at all could be done in Paris, the workers ought to 
be prevented from letting fly before peace is concluded. Bismarck 
will soon be in a position to make peace, either by taking Paris or 
because the European situation will oblige him to put an end to 
the war. However the peace may turn out, it must be concluded 
before the workers can do anything at all. If they should be 
victorious now—in the service of national defence—they would 
have to enter upon the legacy left by Bonaparte and the present 
lousy republic. They would be needlessly crushed by the German 
armies and thrown back another twenty years. They themselves 
can lose nothing by waiting. The possible boundary changes are in

any case only provisional and will be reversed again. To fight for 
the bourgeoisie against the Prussians would be madness. Whatever 
government concludes peace will on that account alone become 
impossible before long, and in internal conflicts there will not be 
much to fear from the army returning home from prisoner-of-war 
camps. The situation will present more favourable chances to the 
workers after the peace than it ever did before. But won't they let 
themselves be carried away under the pressure of the attack from 
without, and proclaim the Social Republic on the eve of the 
storming of Paris? It would be appalling if, as their last act of war, 
the German armies had to fight a battle with the Parisian workers 
at the barricades. It would set us back 50 years and would throw 
everything into such disarray that everybody and everything would 
get into a false position—to say nothing of the national hatred 
and the rule of rhetoric which would then take hold of the French 
workers! 
It is a damned nuisance that there are so few people in Paris 
who have the courage to see things as they really are in the present 
situation. Is there anyone in Paris who dares to admit to himself 
that the active resistance of France has been broken as far as this 
war is concerned, and that consequently there is no prospect of 
successfully repulsing the invasion by means of revolution! 
Precisely because people do not wish to hear the actual truth, I am 
afraid that it may come to that. For the apathy of the workers 
before the fall of the Empire will no doubt have been changed 
now. 
Could you let me know the title of the book by Schaf fiea? He 
really is a worthy opponent for you! The fellow was in the 
Customs Parliament and is a very undistinguished vulgar 
economist, rather along the lines of Faucher, but a Swabian. You 
will just love his book. 
Since it looks as if something has to be annexed in any case, it is 
high time for us to think of a way for French and German 
workers to agree to regard it all as nul et non avenu h and to reverse 
it when occasion presents  itself.  It was my view that this would 
have been prudent at the outbreak of war; now, however, that the 
lot of ceding territory falls to the French, it is essential, otherwise 
they will all raise a terrible hullaballoo.

MARX TO EDWARD SPENCER BEESLY 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 12 September 1870 
My dear Sir, 
Last Wednesday13 A. Serraillier, a member of the General 
Council of the International Workmen's Association, went to Paris 
as the plenipotentiary of the Council. He thought it his duty to 
remain there, not only for taking part in the defence, but to bring 
his influence to bear upon our Paris Federal Council, and he is, in 
point of fact, a man of superior intellectual quality. His wife was 
to-day informed of his resolution. Unfortunately, she is not only 
sans sou,c she and her child, but the creditors of Serraillier having 
claims to the amount of about £12, threaten to sell her furniture 
and throw her on the street. Under these circumstances I and my 
friends have resolved to come to the rescue, and it is for this that I 
take the liberty to call, by this letter, also on you and your friends. 
You will find that the Addressd I laid before the General 
Council, Friday last, and which is in course of printing, coincides 
on many points almost literally with your pamphlet.e 
My opinion is, that Paris will be forced to capitulate, and from 
the private letters I receive from Paris it appears that some

influential members of the Provisional Government are prepared 
for such a turn of events. 
Serraillier writes me to-day that the haste with which the 
Prussians march upon Paris, is the only thing in the world able to 
prevent a new Insurrection of ]une uî\ Paris fallen, France will be 
far from lost if the provinces do their duty. 
The Federal Council of Paris bombards me with telegrams, all to 
this effect: Recognition of the French Republic by England. In point of 
fact, it is most important for France. It is the only thing you can at 
present do for her. The King of Prussia3 treats officially 
Bonaparte as the ruling Sovereign of France. He wants to restore 
him. The French Republic will not exist officially before its 
recognition by the British Government. But no time is to be lost. 
Will you allow your Queenb and your oligarchs, under the 
dictation of Bismarck, to abuse the immense influence of England? 
Yours faithfully, 
Karl Marx 
Apropos. There is just now much useless talk in the English Press 
about 'our defences'. In case of a war with Prussia or the other 
military powers of the Continent, you have one, but this one an 
infallible, means of attack—to destroy their maritime commerce. 
You can do so only by re-vindicating your 'maritime rights', which 
by a Ministerial intrigue, not by any sanction of Parliament, were 
in the Paris Treaty of 1856 surrendered to Russia. Russia 
considers this point of such decisive importance, that she caused 
Prussia, at the very commencement of this war, to exaggerate 
those clauses of the Paris 'understanding'.114 Prussia was, of course, 
but too willing. In the first instance she had no navy. In the 
second instance, it is, of course, the common interest of the 
continental military powers to make England, the only great 
maritime power of Europe, surrender the most telling means of 
maritime warfare on the plea of humanity! The privilege of 
inhumanity—and you can make no war in a 'humane' way—being 
reserved for the land forces! Besides, this diplomatic 'philan­
thropy' supposes that property—always on sea, not on land—is 
more sacred than human life. This is the reason why the stultified 
English manufacturers and merchants allowed themselves to be 
duped by the Paris clauses on maritime war—of no possible use to 
them, because not accepted by the United States. And only in a 
war with them such a proviso could be of any value to the

moneymongers of England. The contempt with which England is 
at present treated by Prussia and Russia (the latter marching 
quietly to India) is only due to their knowledge that in an 
offensive land war she can do nothing, and that for a maritime 
war, where she could be everything, she has disarmed  herself,  or 
has been rather disarmed by the arbitrary act of Clarendon, acting 
under the secret instructions of Palmerston. Declare to-morrow 
that these clauses of the Paris treaty—not even drawn up in the 
form of treaty clauses—are waste paper, and I warrant you the 
tone of the continental bullies will change at once.

ENGELS TO MARX 81 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 13 September 1870 
Dear Moor, 
The Prussians really are incorrigible jackasses! On the orders of 
Vogel von Falckenstein, they have arrested the whole unfortunate 
Social-Democratic Committee in Brunswick, including the printer" 
of the well-intentioned and undoubtedly tame proclamation, and 
have transported them as a body to Lötzen b in East Prussia. 115 
You know that on the pretext of a French landing almost the 
whole of Northern Germany has been put under martial law, so 
that the military authorities can arrest people at will. Fortunately, 
the immediate deportation to East Prussia proves that they are 
just going to be held in custody until peace is concluded, and not 
brought before a court martial in which case the lieutenants who 
have received instructions to hand out punishments would have 
given them a good ten years hard labour or imprisonment in a 
fortress. It is clear, though, how panic-stricken the wretches are at 
the very mention of the word 'Republic', and how ill at ease the 
official world feels when it has no prisoners of state.

TO DEAL  WITH  SUSCEPTIBILITIES  in every direction,  and so  cannot write  as 
we both could  in our own  names. 
The news from Brunswick115  arrived yesterday evening from 
Liebknecht,  but with Wilhelm's usual vagueness  and  hence 
unusable.  I have sent notices about  it today  to the  Pall Mall, Echo, 
etc. a 
The FACT itself  is very good. This time  the  witch-hunt against  the 
'demagogues'116  is beginning before  the end of  the war,  and is  aimed 
at workers rather than  the  student windbags  of yore.  It is  very 
good that  the  Prussians  are  showing themselves  in their true 
colours,  and are  destroying  any  possible illusions  in the  working 
class even before peace  is concluded. Moreover,  the  working class 
can only  be stirred  to action  by direct persecution  on the  part  of 
the state. 
The 'Republic'—even  the  mere word—has given  the  matter 
quite  a new  turn.  E.g. Mr  George Potter—that hero  of the  workers 
from  the  Bee-Hive—has PUBLICLY declared himself A REPUBLICAN. This 
shows  you the  mood  in London.  I hope that  the  Prussian policies 
of the  Court will produce  a lot of  ill-feeling here.  It is a  splendid 
LEVER,  the  UNCONSTITUTIONAL INTERFERENCE  OF THE GRANDDAUGHTER  OF George 
III AND  THE  MOTHER-IN-LAW  OF  FritZb| 
For all that Bismarck  is a  jackass. Just because everything went 
right  for him as  long  as he was the  instrument  of the  aspirations 
to German unity,  he has now  lost his head  to such  an extent that 
he imagines himself able  to throw  all scruples  to the  winds  and 
pursue specific Prussian policies,  not  merely externally,  but 
internally  too. 
Yesterday there  was a  workers' meeting  in a pub in  Lincoln  Inn 
Fields.  We  were sitting  in our own  meeting  as usual  on Tuesdays. 
A telegram arrived  TO COME  TO THE  RESCUE.  The  PEACE  SOCIETY  56 fellows, 
who have been actively 'buying  up'  workers  (e.g.  Cremer),  had as 
good  as managed  to assure themselves  of a  majority, albeit  a slight 
one. Our  sudden appearance TURNED  THE  SCALE.  At issue  was a 
number  of resolutions  on behalf  of the  FRENCH REPUBLIC, which  the 
PEACE SOCIETY claims could lead  to war  with Prussia.  I have today 
sent detailed instructions  to Belgium  and  Switzerland, ditto  to the 
UNITED STATES.

MARX TO CÉSAR DE PAEPE 
IN BRUSSELS 
[London,] 14 September 1870 
Dear Citizen, 
Herewith two copies of our Address,3  one for L'Internationale, 
one for La Liberté. I have no time to translate it, Dupont is in 
Manchester, and Serraillier in Paris as delegate of the General 
Council. My time is fully occupied with correspondence with 
Germany and with the agitation amongst the English working 
men. 
On 5 September our Central Committee at Brunswick published 
an appeal 'To the German Workers' to oppose the  ANNEXATION  of 
French territory and to support peace with the Republic.107  On the 
orders of General Vogel von Falckenstein, the infamous Prussian 
who (in 1866) distinguished himself by his vandalism in Frank­
furt, 119 not only were the copies of the manifesto seized, but all 
the members of the Committee—as well as the unfortunate 
printerb  of the manifesto—were arrested, clapped in irons like 
criminals and transported to Lötzen, c a town in East Prussia. 115 As 
you know, on the pretext of a French landing, the entire coast 
of Northern Germany has been placed under martial law, thus 
enabling those gentlemen, the military, to arrest, pass sentence 
and shoot whenever they think fit. But even in those parts 
of Germany where martial law has not been proclaimed, the 
Prussians, aided and abetted by the middle classes, have intro­
duced a reign of terror directed against all independent opinion. 
Despite this terror and despite the hubbub raised by the bour­
geois patriots, the German working man is conducting himself 
admirably. 
Unfortunately I cannot say the same of our French comrades. 
Their manifesto was absurd.101 'Recross the Rhine!' They forget 
that, in order to return home, the Germans have no need to 
recross the Rhine: rather they can simply withdraw to the 
Palatinate and the Khine (Prussian) Province. You can imagine

Working Men's Association on the Franco-Prussian War'. - b Sievers - c Polish

80 44. Marx to De Paepe. 14 September 1870 
how this chauvinist catchphrase has been exploited by Bismarck's 
official journals! The whole tone of the manifesto is absurd and 
contrary to the spirit of the International. 
I have not had the time to copy out for you the whole of the 
letter I received from Serraillier, but the following passage should 
suffice to enlighten you on the state of affairs in Paris. It is our 
duty not to deceive ourselves with illusions. 
'It is unbelievable that for six years people can be Internationalists, abolish 
frontiers, no longer recognise anyone as a foreigner, and arrive at the stage they 
have now reached, simply in order to preserve a factitious popularity to which they 
will sooner or later fall victim. When I express indignation at their conduct, they 
tell me that, were they to speak otherwise, they would be sent packingl Accordingly 
it seems to them more appropriate to deceive these unfortunate fellows over the 
true situation in France than to seek, at the risk of losing their popularity, to bring 
them back to their senses, a course that would, I believe, be of much greater use to 
our France. Moreover, what a situation they are creating for the International by 
their ultra-chauvinist discourses! How many generations may it not take to erase 
the profound antagonism of nationality which they are seeking to revive by 
whatever means their feeble imagination can suggest! Not that they are stupid, far 
from it. But like me they know that when you flatter the people, you deceive them; 
they feel they are cutting the ground from under their own feet and, I might even 
say, they are afraid of openly saying they are Internationalists, a foolishness from 
which it follows that they can think of nothing better than to parody the revolution of 
'93.' 
This state of affairs will, I trust, all be over come the early and 
inevitable capitulation of Paris. The misfortune of the French and 
even of the working men, is to hark back to great thingsl It is 
essential that events should once and for all destroy this 
reactionary worship of the past! 
The manifesto printed in the supplement to La Solidarité did 
not surprise me. I well knew that those who preach total 
abstention from politics—as though working men were monks 
who established a world of their own away from the world at 
large—would always revert to bourgeois politics at the first 
summons of the historic tocsin. 
With the exception of a very few papers the English press has 
been bought, the majority by Bismarck, the minority by Louis 
Bonaparte, the latter having saved enough money to buy an entire 
army. Nevertheless I have found the means to wage a war to the 
death against those gentry, the Prussians. 
Our friends in Paris have been bombarding me with telegrams 
telling me what I ought to do in Germany. I believe I am a little 
more familiar than the Parisians with the way in which one must 
deal with my compatriots.

Dear Oswald, 
Enclosed are 50 COPIES of our new Address.3 There are a few 
printing errors in it, but they do not distort the meaning. We shall 
correct them in the SECOND EDITION. 
Our Central Committee for Germany (residing in Brunswick) 
issued a manifesto to the German workers on 5 September, 
opposing the ANNEXATION of Alsace and Lorraine and advocating 
the recognition of the French Republic, etc.107  On the orders of 
Vogel von Falckenstein not only were the copies of the manifesto 
confiscated, but also all the members of the Committee—and the 
unfortunate printer, 13 were arrested  INTO  THE  BARGAIN  and transported 
as a body to Lötzen c in East Prussia. 116 I have immediately sent 
reports of the affaird to various London papers and shall see if 
they print them. 
The victory in yesterday's meeting over the people who were 
partly in the pay of the PEACE SOCIETY, 6 and partly unindoctrinated, 
was QUITE ACCIDENTAL. We were just holding the usual Tuesday 
meeting of the General Council of the International when our 
friends telegraphed from the Strand  TO  COME  TO THE  RESCUE  since they 
would otherwise have been out-voted. And this is just what we 
did.117

I have been unable to get to bed before three in the morn­

49. Marx to Beesly. 16 September 1870 85 
The worst anticipations of the two Addresses of the General 
Council of the International3 have already been realised. 
Having declared to make war against Louis Bonaparte and not 
against the French people, Prussia makes now war upon the 
French people and peace with Bonaparte. It has let out the 
murder. It has declared its intention of restoring him or his family 
to the Tuileries. The infamous Times affects to-day to treat this as 
mere gossip. b It knows, or ought to know that the thing has been 
printed in the Berlin Staats-Anzeiger (the Prussian Moniteur). From 
semi-official Prussian papers, such as the Cologne Gazette, 0 I see 
that that old ass, King William, true to his Hohenzollern family 
traditions, already prostrates himself at the feet of the Czard and 
implores him to be so magnanimous as to employ him as his 
man-servant against the Turks! Lastly, the reaction has already set 
in in Germany. Our people at Brunswick, to begin with, have, 
as I wrote you, been marched off in chains like common felons 
to the Eastern frontier.115 But this is only one fact amongst 
hundreds. 
After the first war of German Independence against 
Napoleon I,e  the wild and ferocious Government's chase upon the 
so-called demagogues (die demagogischen Untersuchungen ) lasted 
fully for 20 years! 116 but they set in only after the end of the war. 
They now begin before the conclusion of peace. 
Then their persecutions were directed against the windy idealists 
and frothy youths (the students at the Universities) of the middle 
class,  bureaucracy and aristocracy. They are now directed against 
the working class. 
For my part, / am delighted at all those misdeeds of the Prussian 
Government. They will stir Germany. Now what I think you ought 
to do is this: The first Address of the General Council on the war 
was only published in full by the Pall Mall? but extracts and even 
leading articles on it appeared in many other papers. This time, 
although the Address has been forwarded to all London papers, 
not one has taken the least notice of it, except the Pall Mall, which 
gives a very short extract.11

having proposed there my friend Engels' Notes on the War. I 
did so at the request of A—B— a who, from time to time, had 
smuggled some paragraphs on the 'International' into the Pall 
Mali Hence our second address is not altogether burked in that 
paper.) 
From the Continent, where people were and are used, even at 
Moscow and St Petersburg, even in the French papers under the 
Bonapartist rule, even now at Berlin, to see the manifestoes of the 
International treated seriously and reproduced in full by some 
journal or other, we have been once and again taunted for our 
negligence in not using the 'free' London press. They have, of 
course, no idea whatsoever, and will not believe in the utter 
corruption, of that vile concern, long since branded by William 
Cobbett as 'mercenary, infamous, and illiterate'. 
Now I believe you would do the greatest possible service to the 
International, and I should take good care to have your article 
reproduced in our journals in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, 
Holland, Denmark, Hungary, Germany, France, and the United 
States—if you in the Fortnightly Review would publish something 
on the International,b the manifestoes of the General Council on 
the war and the treatment we have to undergo at the hands 
of that paragon press, that 'free' English press! Those fellows 
are in fact more enslaved to the Prussian police than the Berlin 
papers. 
Lafargue, now editor of a paper at Bordeaux,0 sends you and 
Mrs Beesly his best compliments. 
Yours truly,

MARX TO EUGEN OSWALD 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 23 September 1870 
Dear Oswald, 
Herewith the Volksstaat (Nos. 72-76) and the Volkswille (No. 34), 
both of which I must have back by Monday NEXT.* 
I only receive occasional copies of the Zukunft. The copies that 
Engels has have not yet been unpacked, any more than the rest of 
the furniture he has JUST brought down from Manchester. 125 This 
is also the reason why I cannot yet accept your kind invitation. I 
must first get Engels AND his FAMILY settled in. 
I am toto oveloh opposed to your neutralisation plan 126 and have 
already expressed my views to this effect in detail after hearing 
about the plan from another direction. 
If people were SERIOUSLY concerned about the military security of 
Germany, it would meet the case exactly if the fortresses of Metz 
and Strasbourg were to be razed to the ground. 
Bismarck knows this. He also knows that on this side neutralisa­
tion can achieve no more and that it would contribute much  less,  in 
fact nothing, towards the reconciliation with France that will again 
become necessary in the future. It is one of those measures that 
ruin everything and settle nothing. 
Consider further that the entire opposition in Germany is only a 
real power, a power that grows as a result of persecution by the 
government, because and insofar as it makes a strong stand on 
principle. 
This is appreciated not only by the workers but even by people 
like Jacoby, people like Ludwig Simon of Trier and even Jakob 
Venedey! Once such a motley opposition starts playing around 
with diplomacy, all is lost. It would gain nothing at all through 
such diplomacy but on the contrary, by involving itself with C c 
it would lose the right to declare: Annex,  IF YOU  PLEASE.  We declare 
these annexations non avenues A\ 
Du reste*  Jules Favre, and not Thiers, is the man of the moment. 
Razing the fortresses was first proposed in the official Journal de

MARX TO EDWARD SPENCER BEESLY 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 19 October 1870 
My dear Sir, 
Deak is against the workmen. He is, in fact, a Hungarian edition 
of an English Whig. 
As to Lyons,128 I have received letters not fit for publication. At 
first everything went well. Under the pressure of the 'Internation­
al' section, the Republic was proclaimed before Paris had taken 
that step. A revolutionary Government was at once established— 
La Commune—composed partly of workmen belonging to the 
'International', partly of Radical middle-class Republicans. The 
octrois were at once abolished, and rightly so. The Bonapartist 
and Clerical intriguers were intimidated. Energetic measures were 
taken to arm the whole people. The middle class began if not 
really to sympathise with, at least to quietly undergo, the new 
order of things. The action of Lyons was at once felt at Marseilles 
and Toulouse, where the 'International' sections are strong. 
But the asses, Bakunine and Cluseret, arrived at Lyons and 
spoiled everything. Belonging both to the 'International', they had, 
unfortunately, influence enough to mislead our friends. The Hotel 
de Ville was seized—for a short time—and most foolish decrees Printed according to a typewritten

on the abolition de l'état*  and similar nonsense were issued. You 
understand that the very fact of a Russian—represented by the 
middle class papers as an agent of Bismarck—pretending to 
impose himself as the leader of a Comité du Salut de la France b was 
quite sufficient to turn the balance of public opinion. As to 
Cluseret, he behaved both as a fool and a coward. These two men 
have left Lyons after their failure. 
At Rouen, as in most other industrial towns of France, the 
sections of the International, following the example of Lyons, have 
enforced the official admission into the 'committees of defence'10S 
of the working-class element. 
Still, I must tell you that according to all information I receive 
from France, the middle class on the whole prefers Prussian 
conquest to the victory of a Republic with Socialist tendencies. 
Yours truly, 
Karl Marx 
I send you a copy of the New-York Tribune which I received 
yesterday. You will oblige me by returning it after perusal. It 
contains an article on the International, penned I do not know by 
whom, but to guess from style and manner, Mr Dana might be the 
writer. 
I forward also three copies of the Défense nationale, which 
Lafargue sends you with his compliments.

Imandt junior should stay here until Wednesday 3 and  then leave 
on the  steamer. 
Firstly,  as far as his  departure itself  is concerned,  we do not  wish 
to lose  the  pleasure  of his  company  so  soon,  and it  will  do him 
good  to take  a breather. 
Secondly, quoadb  the  method  of travel,  he  arrived here from 
Southampton quite frozen,  and the  train journey  to  Dundee 
would  be far too  exhausting  for him (and it  would  be even worse 
in the 3rd  class), whereas travelling  FIRST CLASS  by boat  for  20sh.,  he 
would receive  his due  measure  of warmth. 
He is a  very sound  and  well-educated young  man who has  given

thorn  in the  side  of the  Prussians with  his  Volksstaat even though 
he imagines,  in his  narrow-minded  way,  that he always  has to say 
black when  the  enemy says white  and  vice versa.  In consequence 
he takes  all the  phrases  of someone like Gambetta  and his  consorts

matters  of fact  in just  the  same  way as the  French  are  entertained

Mr Freiligrath, meanwhile,  has  become  the  producer  of feelings

MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN ,21 
IN HANOVER 
London, 13 December [1870] 
Dear Kugelmann, 
You must explain my long silence by the fact that during the 
war, which has taken most of the FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS of the 
GENERAL COUNCIL to France, I have had to conduct practically the 
entire international correspondence, which is no trifle. Apart from 
that, with the 'postal freedom' prevailing now in Germany and 
particularly in the North German Confederation,55 and quite 
'particularly' in Hanover, it is dangerous—not for me, it is true, 
but for my German correspondents—if I write them my opinion 
of the war, and what else can one write about at the present 
moment? 
For example, you ask me for our first Address on the war. I

had sent it to you. It has obviously been intercepted. Today I am 
enclosing the two Addresses issued as a pamphlet,3 as well as 
Professor Beesly's article in The Fortnightly Review^ and today's 
Daily News. Since this paper has a Prussian tinge, the things will 
probably get through. Professor Beesly is a Comtist and is as such 
obliged to support all sorts of CROTCHETS, but for the rest a very 
capable and brave man. He is professor of history at London 
University. 
It seems that Germany was not satisfied with capturing 
Bonaparte, his generals and his army; with him, imperialism too, 
with all its infirmities, has acclimatised itself in the land of the oak 
and the linden. 
As to the German bourgeois, I am not at all surprised by his 
obsession with conquest. First of all, to seize things is the vital 
principle of every bourgeoisie and to take foreign provinces is 
after all 'taking'. And then the German citizen has dutifully 
accepted so many kicks from his sovereigns, and particularly 
from the Hohenzollerns, that it must be a real pleasure to him 
when, for a change, those kicks are administered to the fo­
reigner. 
In any case this war has freed us from the 'bourgeois 
republicans'. It has put a horrible end to that crew. And that is an 
important result. It has given our professors the best opportunity 
of damning themselves in the eyes of the whole world as servile 
pedants. The relations which will come in its wake are the best 
propaganda for our principles. 
Here in England public opinion on the outbreak of war was 
ultra-Prussian; it has now turned into the opposite. In the cafés 
chantants, for example, the German singers with their Watch on 
the Rhine c are hissed off while French singers with the Marseillaise 
are accompanied in choro. Apart from the decided sympathies of 
the mass of the people with the Republic and the irritation of the 
RESPECTABILITY about the alliance between Prussia and Russia—now 
as clear as daylight—and the shameless tone of Prussian diploma­
cy since the military successes, the way in which the war has been 
conducted—the requisitioning system, the burning down of

villages, the shooting of francs-tireurs, 130 the taking of hostages and 
similar recapitulations of the Thirty Years' War 131—all this has 
aroused universal indignation here. OF COURSE, the English have 
done the same in India, Jamaica, etc., but the French are neither 
Hindus, nor Chinese, nor Negroes, and the Prussians are no 
HEAVEN-BORN ENGLISHMEN. It is a truly Hohenzollern idea that a people 
commits a crime in continuing to defend itself once its regular 
army has disappeared. In fact, the war of the Prussian people 
against Napoleon I was a real thorn in the side of the gallant 
Frederick William III, as you can see from Professor Pertz's life of 
Gneisenau," who made the war of francs-tireurs into a system 
through his Landsturm regulations. 132 The fact that the people 
fought on their own initiative and independent of the all-highest's 
order gave Frederick William III no peace. 
However, the last word has not yet been spoken. The war in 
France can still take a very 'unpleasant' turn. The resistance put 
up by the Loire Army 133 was 'beyond' calculation, and the present 
scattering of the German forces right and left is merely to instil 
fear, but in fact only results in awakening the power of defence at 
every point and weakening the offensive force. The threatened 
bombardment of Paris is also a mere trick. On the town of Paris 
itself it can, by all the rules of probability, have no serious effect. 
If a few outworks are destroyed, a few breaches made, what help 
is that when the besieged outnumber the besiegers? And if the 
besieged made exceptionally good SORTIES, when the enemy 
defended himself behind ENTRENCHMENTS, how much better would 
they not fare when the roles are reversed? 
To starve Paris out is the only real way. But if it is delayed long 
enough to allow armies to be formed and the people's war to 
develop in the provinces, even that will do nothing except transfer 
the centre of gravity. Moreover, even after the surrender of Paris, 
which cannot be held and kept quiet by a mere handful, a large 
part of the INVADERS would be maintained in idleness. 
But however the war may end, it has given the French 
proletariat practice in arms, and that is the best guarantee of the 
future. 
The shameless tone which Russia and Prussia adopt towards 
England may have wholly unexpected and unpleasant results for 
them. The matter simply stands like this: By the Paris Peace 
Treaty of 1856 England disarmed  herself. ni England is a sea power 
and can counterpose to the great continental military powers only

the weapon of naval warfare. The certain method here is 
temporarily to destroy, or bring to a standstill, the overseas trade 
of the continental powers. This mainly depends on operating the 
principle of seizing enemy goods in neutral vessels. This MARITIME 
RIGHT (as well as other similar RIGHTS) was surrendered by the 
English in the so-called Declaration attached to the Paris Treaty. 
Clarendon did this on the secret order of the Russian Palmerston. 
The Declaration, however, is not an integral part of the treaty 
itself and has never been legally ratified in England. The Russian 
and Prussian gendemen are reckoning without their host if they 
imagine that the influence of the Queen,3 who is Prussianised 
from FAMILY INTEREST, and the bourgeois feeble-mindedness of a 
Gladstone, would at a decisive moment keep John Bull from 
throwing this self-created 'charming obstacle'b  overboard. And he 
can then strangle Russian-German overseas trade in a few weeks. 
We shall then have an opportunity of studying the long faces of 
the Petersburg and Berlin diplomats, and the still longer faces of 
the 'power patriots'.— Qui vivra, verra. 0

A friend of mine Mr Oswald sends me the enclosed. He says 
that the usual tickets have been sent to The Pall Mall Gazette and 
wishes me to say a word in favour of Mrs Oswald's tonight's 
concert being noticed in that paper, or at least to induce your 
musical critic to go and hear her. I have told him that this is 
entirely out of my line and that I even do not know how to go 
about such a thing. However he insists, and as he is a very worthy 
fellow I can only say, that if you can consistently do something in 
that direction you will confer a personal favour upon me. I am too 
bad a musician to permit myself an opinion but I have heard 
people who ought to know, speak very highly of Mrs Oswald's

Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
We have just received the news that Liebknecht, Bebel and 
Hepner were arrested yesterday. It is the revenge of the Prussians 
for the moral defeats suffered by the Prussian Empire at the 
hands of Liebknecht and Bebel even before it was born. 134 We all 
rejoiced here at the courageous behaviour of both of them in the 
Reichstag under circumstances where it was really no small 
achievement to put forward our views freely and defiantly. We

suppose that their arrest was motivated above all by petty revenge 
and the wish to destroy the paper3  as well as to make their 
re-election impossible. The indictment for high treason will turn 
out to be pure moonshine. But the Prussian gentlemen may well 
be greatly mistaken, for in view of the really admirable reaction of 
the German workers which has even compelled that swine 
Schweitzer to acknowledge the leadership of Liebknecht and 
Bebel, this coup de force may well completely miss the target, and 
rather provoke the opposite to what was intended. The German 
workers have displayed an understanding and energy during the 
war which puts them at the head of the European workers' 
movement at a stroke, and you will appreciate the sense of pride 
with which we witness it. 
However, we also have the duty to make sure, as best we can, 
that our arrested friends and their families in Germany do not 
suffer need, especially at this time when the approaching 
Christmas season is in any case being so bitterly spoilt for them. 
We have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing a £5 note of the 
Bank of England 'B/10,  04841,  London, 12 October 1870' and 
would ask you to share it with Mrs Bebel. 
We also enclose 7 thalers collected by the local German Workers' 
Educational Society 135 and intended for the families of the 
Brunswickers who have been arrested.115 Might I ask you to sign 
and return the enclosed receipt for the latter, so that it may be 
returned to the Society as proof that Marx has duly forwarded it. 
My wifeb is a revolutionary Irishwoman and so you can imagine 
the rejoicings at home here yesterday on hearing the news that the 
condemned Fenians had been amnestied—albeit in the shabbiest, 
most Prussian of ways.136 And then to have to hear of the arrest of 
our friends in Germany immediately afterwards! 
Farewell, dear Mrs Liebknecht, and do not lose heart. The 
Prussians, and the Russians, their masters, have started something 
that they will be unable to finish. 
With my warmest sympathy, 
Yours, 
Frederick Engels

greetings to the children.

My dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
The General Council of the 'International' has started a 
collection for the families of the German 'patriots' persecuted by 
the Prussian government—patriots in the true sense of the word. 
The first £5 I am sending you now are intended for Mrs Bebel 
and yourself. 
The libellous London correspondent of that pedant Bieder­
mann 2 undeniably belongs to the police personnel of the local 
Prussian Embassy, which was active in like fashion at the time of the 
Communist trial in Cologne in 1852. 138 We shall track the man 
down and publicise the activities of this clique in the local press 
and so shed light on the latest phase of Christian-Prussian-
Germanic ethics. 
In the issue of the Volksstaat that arrived today I see that there 
is a notice in which Mr Nechayev is yet again being treated with 
undue seriousness. 15 All the things that this Nechayev has had 
printed in the European press about his deeds and sufferings in 
Russia are bare-faced fabrications. I have the proofs of this to hand. 
His name, therefore, is one which should never be mentioned. 
My wife and daughters0  send their warmest regards to you, 
your children and to Liebknecht.

Jules Favre 
The infamous decree of 27th June 1848, by which many 
thousand Parisian workmen made prisoners during the June 
Insurrection,113  were, without even the formality of any judicial 
inquiry, to be transported to Algeria, etc., was drawn up by Jules 
Favre. Afterwards, he constantly refused to join the motions of 
amnesty, brought forward from time to time by the Republican 
party of the Constituent Assembly. 
Jules Favre was one of the most notorious tools of the reign of 
terror inflicted on the French working class by General Cavaignac 
after the Insurrection of June. He supported all the shameless 
laws then passed with a view to suppress the right of reunion, 
coalition, and the freedom of the press. 141 
On the 16th April 1849, Jules Favre, as the spokesman of the 
counterrevolutionary majority of a parliamentary committee, 
proposed to grant Louis Bonaparte the  1,200,000  francs he 
demanded for the expedition against the Roman Republic. 142

Dear Harney, 
I want for the second volume of my Criticism of Political 
Economy documents on the disposal of public lands in the United 
States since the beginning of the Civil War.143 Mr S. Meyer, a 
friend of mine at New York, has advised me to address myself to 
Mr Wilson, Commissioner of the General Land Office, Washing­
ton. As I am not at all acquainted with the form in which this 
ought to be done, I address myself to you. Perhaps, you will act as 
my negotiator.144 
In spring, there will be offered a second edition in Germany of 
the first volume of my work.145  A Russian translation at St 
Petersburg has been stopped by the Moscovite police, 146 a French 
edition at Paris by the war.147  An 'homme de lettres' b at New York 
proposed me preparing an English translation for the United 
States 148 but I declined the offer since he seemed to me not a 
competent man for the task. 
By our International Council0 we have stirred the English 
working class and provoked numerous demonstrations in favour 
of the French Republic149 and against the policy of unctuous 
Gladstone, who has become a servile tool in the hands of the 
granddaughter of George III and the mother-in-law of 'Fritz'.d 
Unfortunately, some of the leading workmen—like Mr Motters-
head, an old Chartist and a member of our Council—have been 
bought up by the Peace Society.56 They can do no harm at London 
but they do in the provinces. 
The Trades' Councils at Manchester and Birmingham have 
lately become active agents of the General Council of the

The formation of the so-called Central Committee in New York 
was absolutely not to my taste.151  I deferred the approval of the 
General Council as long as possible but found the ground taken 
from under my feet as soon as it emerged from a letter from Mr 
Charnier that Dupont, our French secretary'—a thoroughly good 
man, but too forceful and so often led astray by his thirst for 
action—had been responsible for starting the whole thing. Alors, il 
n'y avait plus rien à faire? He was officially rebuked by the General 
Council, mais le jeu était fait*l Engels (who now lives here) and I 
would just like to remind Vogt and yourself that according to our 
Rules the General Council can only intervene with a veto in the 
a Here: most cherished goal. - b K. Marx, 'On the Freedom of the Press and 
Meetings in Germany'. - c Corresponding Secretary of the General Council for the 
French sections of the International in the United States - d So nothing further could 
be done. - e Here: but the damage was done!

event of open VIOLATIONS of the Rules and principles of the 
International. Apart from that, however, it is our invariable policy 
to let the sections have their head and conduct their own affairs. 
The only exception to this was France, because of her special 
situation under the Empire. It follows, therefore, that our friends 
will just have to cut their coat according to their cloth. Here in 
London, we work together with Englishmen, some of whom are 
not at all to our liking and who, as we know perfectly well, only 
want to exploit the International as a milch-cow for their own 
petty personal ambitions. Nevertheless, we have to put bonne mine 
à mauvais jeu? If we were to withdraw in indignation on their 
account, we would only give them a power which is at pre­
sent paralysed by our presence. And you must act in the same 
way. 
Quant àb Vogt I was convinced from the outset that pompous 
Sorge was just blustering. However, I had to make a reply when 
he questioned me directly. 0 Otherwise he would have taken his 
gossip to my friend Schily in person, a piece of unpleasantness I 
wished the latter to be spared. 88 
We have given rise to a powerful movement among the working 
class over here against Gladstone (in support of the FRENCH 
REPUBLIC  149), which will probably bring about his downfall. Prussia is 
wholly under the sway of the Russian Cabinet. If it gains a conclusive 
victory, the HEROIC GERMAN PHILISTINE will get what he deserves. 
Unfortunately, the present French government thinks it can wage a 
revolutionary war without a revolution. 
Freiligrath, the noble poet, is on a visit to his daughters0  here at 
the moment. He does not dare to show his face to me. The 60,000 
thalers presented to him by the German philistines 129 have to be 
paid off in Tyrtaean hymns like 'Germania, thou woman proud', e 
etc. 
My health has again been abominable for months on end, but 
who can give thought to such trivia at a time of such momentous 
historical events!

following calamity: the censor was severely rebuked by the MINISTER 
OF THE INTERIOR,3 the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF was fired, and that issue of the 
journal—all the COPIES they could still get hold of—was consigned 
to the flames!152 
I don't know whether I told you that since the beginning of 
1870 I have been having to teach myself Russian, which I now 
read fairly fluently. This came about after I had been sent 
Flerovsky's very important work on The Condition of the Working 
Class (Especially the Peasants) in Russia from St Petersburg; I also 
wanted to familiarise myself with the (excellent) economic works of 
Chernyshevsky (who was rewarded by being sentenced to the 
Siberian mines for the past seven years153). The result was worth 
the effort that a man of my age must make to master a language 
differing so greatly from the classical, Germanic, and Romance 
languages. The intellectual movement now taking place in Russia 
testifies to the fact that things are seething deep below the surface. 
Minds are always connected by invisible threads with the BODY of 
the people. 
You and Vogt still owe me your photograms. At least I think 
they were promised to me. 
Regards to you and Vogt, 
Yours, 
Karl Marx

Dear Mr Sorge, 
All reports from the German sections in America are to be sent 
to me. Eccarius is only the correspondent for the Yankees. As 
Secretary TO THE GENERAL COUNCIL he has nothing to do with FOREIGN 
CORRESPONDENCE. 
I had completely forgotten the business about the 'contribution' 
of the German section.154 On receiving your letter, therefore, I 
wrote to Eccarius 17 whose reply, which I enclose, can also serve as 
a receipt. 
I have already written about the FORMATION of the CENTRAL COUNCIL 
(we would have preferred the term Central Committee '51 to avoid 
confusion).3 
I have not received Kellogg.b It was presumably sent in a yellow 
envelope that I received from the POST OFFICE here. It was torn 
open and had been stamped 'NO CONTENTS'. I expect that the 
envelope was not strong enough. 
A few weeks ago I sent to your address a large parcel of 
publications of the GENERAL COUNCIL of different dates but up to 
now have had no notice of receipt. They belonged to me 
personally and I sent them because the supplies of the GENERAL 
COUNCIL are quite exhausted (for the majority of its publications). 
Yours sincerely, 
K. Marx

Dear Friend, 
Professor John Morley, the editor of The Fortnightly Review, 
wrote to me yesterday requesting me to ask you if you would like 
to write a short essay on conditions in Germany for the Review (it 
would be translated into English here). At Mr Morley's request I 
shall also probably submit something for the April issue (contribu­
tions for that issue have to be ready by 10 March) . b In the 
February number, the Fortnightly had essays in the Bismarckian 
spirit by the suspended republican Blind0  and by Professor Kinkel, 
for the same purpose as the one for which the Spartans demon­
strated off to their young men the slaves they had first made 
drunk. 
Hoping for an early reply from you, 
With sincere good wishes,

MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 121 
IN HANOVER 
London, 4 February 1871 
Dear Kugelmann, 
I am sorry to learn from your last letter that your state of health 
has again got worse. In the autumn and winter months mine was 
tolerable, although the cough which I contracted during my last 
stay in Hanover 55 is still troubling me. 
I sent you The Daily News containing my letter.3 Obviously it has 
been intercepted like the other things I sent you. Today I am 
enclosing the cutting, as well as the first Address of the General 
Council. The letter actually contains nothing but facts, but was 
effective for precisely that reason. 
You know my opinion of  MIDDLE-CLASS  HEROES.  Still, Mr Jules Favre 
(notorious from the days of the Provisional Government and 
Cavaignac c) et Co. have contrived to surpass my worst anticipa­
tions.  First of all they allowed the 'sabre orthodoxe', the 'crétin 
militaire', as Blanqui rightly dubs Trochu, to carry out his 'plan'. 
This plan consisted simply in prolonging the passive resistance of 
Paris to the utmost limit, that is, to STARVATION POINT, and in 
confining the offensive to sham manoeuvres and 'des sorties 
platoniques' . I am not 'guessing' all this. I know the contents of a 
letter which Jules Favre himself wrote to Gambetta, and in which 
he complains that he and other members of that part of the 
government cowering in Paris sought in vain to spur Trochu on to 
serious offensive measures. Trochu always answered that that 
would give the upper hand to Parisian demagogy. Gambetta 
replied: Vous avez prononcé votre propre condamnation d\ Trochu 
considered it much more important to keep down the Reds in 
Paris with the help of his Breton bodyguard—which rendered 
him the same service that the Corsicans rendered Louis 
Bonaparte 156—than to defeat the Prussians. This is the real secret of 
the defeats not only at Paris, but throughout France, where the

63. Marx to Kugelmann. 4 February 1871 109 
bourgeoisie, in agreement with the majority of the local au­
thorities, have acted on the same principle. 
After Trochu's plan had been carried through to its  CLIMAX—to 
the point where Paris had to surrender or starve—Jules Favre et 
Co. were only to follow the example of the Governor of the 
fortress at Toul. a He did not surrender. He merely explained to 
the Prussians that he was compelled through lack of food to 
abandon the defence and open the gates of the fortress. They 
could now do as they chose. 
But Jules Favre is not content with signing a formal surren­
der. 157 Having declared  himself,  his governmental colleagues and 
Paris to be prisoners of war of the roi de Prusse* he has the impudence 
to act on behalf of all  France.  What did he know of the state of affairs in 
France outside Paris? Absolutely nothing, except what Bismarck was 
gracious enough to tell him. 
More. These Messieurs les prisonniers du roi de Prusse c go further 
and declare that the part of the French government still free in 
Bordeaux 158 has lost its power and must only act in unison with 
them—the prisoners of war of the Prussian King. Since they, as 
prisoners of war, can themselves only act at the command of their 
war-lord, they have thereby proclaimed the King of Prussia de 
facto the highest authority in France. 
Even Louis Bonaparte, after he surrendered and was taken 
prisoner at Sedan,15 was less shameless. To Bismarck's proposals 
he replied that he could enter into no negotiations because, by the 
very fact of his being a Prussian prisoner, he had ceased to hold 
any authority in France. 
At the most Favre could have accepted a conditional armistice 
for the whole of France, with the proviso, namely, that this 
agreement should be sanctioned by the Bordeaux government, 
which alone had the right and the capacity to agree upon the 
clauses of such an armistice with the Prussians. They, at any rate, 
would not have allowed the latter to exclude the Eastern theatre of 
war from the armistice. They would not have allowed the 
Prussians to round off the outlines of their occupation so 
profitably to themselves. 
Rendered impudent by the pretensions of his prisoners of war, 
who in that capacity continue to play at being the French 
government, Bismarck is now interfering sans gêne d in internal

French affairs. He protests, the noble fellow, against Gambetta's 
decree concerning the general elections to the Assemblée, because 
the decree is prejudicial to the freedom of the elections! 160 INDEED! 
Gambetta should answer with a protest against the state of siege and 
other circumstances in Germany, which annul the freedom of the 
elections to the Reichstag. 
I hope that Bismarck sticks to his conditions of peace! Four 
hundred million pounds sterling as war indemnity1 '—half the 
English national debt! Even the French bourgeois will under­
stand that. They will perhaps at last realise that by continuing the 
war they  could,  at the worst, only win. 
The  MOB,  high class and low, judges by appearances, by the 
façade, the immediate success. During the last twenty years it has, 
ALL OVER THE WORLD, apotheosised Louis Bonaparte. I have in actual 
fact always exposed him, even at his apogée, as a mediocre canaille. 
That is also my opinion of the Junker Bismarck. Nevertheless, I 
do not consider Bismarck as stupid as he would be if his 
diplomacy were voluntary. The man is caught by the Russian 
Chancellery in a net which only a lion could tear through, and he 
is no lion. 
For example, Bismarck's demand that France should hand over 
her twenty best men-of-war and Pondicherry in the East Indies! 
Such an idea could not emanate from a genuine Prussian 
diplomat. He would know that a Prussian Pondicherry would be 
nothing but a Prussian hostage in English hands; that England, if 
she wanted to, could seize the twenty men-of-war before they 
enter the Baltic Sea, and that such demands could only have the 
object, absurd from the Prussian point of view, of making John 
Bull distrustful before the Prussians are  OUT  OF THE  FRENCH  WOOD.  But 
Russia is interested precisely in such a result, in order to secure 
Prussia's vassalage still more firmly. In fact these demands have 
given rise to a complete change of feeling even in the peace-loving 
English middle class. Everybody is now calling for war. This 
provocative act and this threat to English interests are making 
even the bourgeois mad. It is more than probable that, thanks to 
this piece of Prussian 'wisdom', Gladstone et Co.  WILL  BE KICKED  OUT  OF 
OFFICE AND SUPPLANTED BY A MINISTRY DECLARING WAR AGAINST PRUSSIA. 
On the other hand things look pretty 'awful' in Russia. Since 
William became an Emperor,162 the old Muscovite, anti-German 
party, with the heir to the throne3 at its head, has again won the 
upper hand completely. And it is supported by the sentiments of 
Alexander Alexandrovich (future Alexander III) 

=====第145页=====
63. Marx  to Kugelmann.  4 February  1871 111 
the people. Gorchakov's subtle policy is incomprehensible  to them.  It 
is therefore probable that  the  Tsara will either have  to reverse  his 
foreign policy altogether,  or  THAT  HE WILL  BE OBLIGED  TO KICK  THE  BUCKET, 
like his  predecessors Alexander  I, Paul  and  Peter  III. 
With  a simultaneous convulsion  in the  politics  of England  and 
Russia, WHERE WOULD PRUSSIA  BE at a  moment when  her  frontiers  to 
both the  north-east  and  south-east  are  left defenceless against  any 
invasion  and  Germany's military strength  is exhausted?  Not 
forgetting that since  the  outbreak  of war  Prussia-Germany  has  sent 
1,500,000  men to  France,  of whom only about 700,000  are  still on 
their feet! 
So, despite  all appearance  to the  contrary, Prussia's position  is 
ANYTHING BUT PLEASANT.  If France holds  out,  uses  the  armistice  to 
reorganise  her  army  and  finally gives  the war a  really revolution­
ary character—and  the  artful Bismarck  is doing  his  best TO THIS 
END—the  new  German, Borussianb Empire  may  still get a  quite 
unexpected thrashing  as its  baptism.

MARX TO PAUL LAFARGUE 
IN BORDEAUX 
[London,] 4 February 1871 
Dear Paul, 
Il faut créer des nouveaux défenseurs à la France* You and Laura 
seem seriously and successfully engaged in that patriotic business. 
The whole family was delighted to hear that our dear Laura has 
passed victoriously through the critical juncture and we hope the 
progress will prove no less favourable. 
Embrace little Schnappyb on my part and tell him that Old 
Nickc feels highly elated at the two photograms of his successor. 
In the 'serious' copy the stern qualities of the little man protrude, 
while in his attitude as franc-fileurd  there is a charming expression 
of humour and espièglerie." 
You know my low opinion of middle-class heroes. Still, Jules 
Favre et Co. have contrived to surpass my worst anticipations. 
When Trochu had carried out his mysterious 'plan', that is to say, 
when that 'sabre orthodoxe', that 'crétin militaire' had pushed the 
passive resistance of Paris to that point where there remained only 
the alternative of starvation or capitulation—Jules Favre and Co. 
might have followed the precedent of the Governor of Toul.' 
When his power of resistance had altogether broken down, he did 
not capitulate. He simply informed the Prussians of the real state 
of things, declared that he could not any longer go on with the 
defence, being deprived of provisions, and that they might now do 
as they liked. He made them no concession at all. He simply 
recognised a fait accompli Favre et Co., on the contrary, not only 
sign a formal capitulation. 157 They have the impudence to act on 
behalf of all France, although in complete ignorance of the state of 
affairs en dehors de Paris* in regard to which they were strictly

cended to vouchsafe them. Moreover, having capitulated, having 
become Messieurs les prisonniers du roi de Prusse, 3 they go further 
and declare that the bordelais delegation 158 has lost its power and 
must only act in union with 'Messieurs les prisonniers du roi de 
Prusse'. Why, even Louis Bonaparte, after his capitulation and 
surrender at Sedan, 159 declared to Bismarck he could enter into no 
negotiations with him, because he had ceased to be a free agent, 
and because, by the very fact of his being a Prussian prisoner, he 
had ceased to hold any authority over France! 
Thus even L. Bonaparte was less shameless than Favre et Co.! 
The only condition which Favre could have accepted conditional­
ly, that is to say under the reserve of his act being assented to by 
the bordelais delegation, was the armistice. Yet to settle the terms of 
that armistice he must have left to the men who were not prisoners 
of le roi de Prusse. They would certainly not have allowed the 
Prussians to exclude from that armistice the Eastern theatre of war, 
and would not have allowed the Prussians to improve, on the plea 
of the armistice, the whole outlines of their military occupation, 
rounding it off in the way most profitable to themselves. 
Embolded by the dastardly servilism of the Paris delegation who 
presume to participate in the government of France, after having 
become Messieurs les capitulards b et les prisonniers du roi de Prusse, 
Bismarck considers himself and acts already as the de facto 
supreme authority in France. He protests against Gambetta's decree 
relating to the general elections as interfering with their liberty. 160 
He dictates the terms on which the General Assembly ought to be 
chosen. Why! Gambetta might reply by protesting against the 
conditions under which at this very moment the general  elections  for 
the Reichstag are carried on in Germany? He might insist that to 
render these elections free, Bismarck ought above all things to 
abolish or at least to suspend the state of siege maintained through 
great part of Prussia. To give you one instance of the liberty of 
election in Germany. At Frankfort (on the Main) a workmen's 
candidate (not residing in Frankfort) is proposed and opens his 
electoral campaign in that town. What do the Prussian authorities 
resort to? To the expulsion of that candidate from Frankfort by the 
police force!16S 
I hope that the Prussians will insist on their modest demand of 
400 millions of £ sterling war contribution by France!161 This may 
a Worthy prisoners of the King of Prussia - b  a contemptuous nickname for those 
who came out for the surrender of Paris during the 1870-71 siege; later on it came to 
denote the capitulants in general. - c The first elections to the Reichstag since the 
proclamation of the German Empire were fixed for 3 March 1871.

rouse even the French middle class whose manoeuvres together 
with the intrigues of the local administration (which Gambetta has 
allowed to a great part to rest in the hands of Bonapartists, 
Orleanists, etc.) are the true key to the till now reverses of the war. 
Even the middle class may at last become aware that they will lose 
more by giving than by fighting! 
At the same time, if France holds out still for some time, the 
foreign relations will become much more favourable to her cause. 
In England the Gladstone ministry is seriously endangered. It 
may soon be kicked out. The public opinion here is now again 
warlike to the highest degree. This change has been worked by 
Prussia's demands, mainly by her asking Pon dicherry and the 20 
first-rate French men-of-war. John Bull sees in this a menace 
against England and a Russian intrigue (and these demands have 
indeed been suggested to Prussia by the St Petersburg cabinet). 
In Russia itself a great change seems imminent. Since the 
assumption of the Imperial title by the King of Prussia,162  the 
anti-German party, the so-called Moscovite party, led by the Prince 
successor, 3 has again got the upper hand. It is very probable that 
the present Emperorb  will either have to accept its dictates and a 
consequent change of his foreign policy, or that he will share the 
fate of his predecessors and by some means or other [be] released 
of his 'mortal body'. If such a convulsion in Russia takes place, 
Prussia, whose frontiers ön the Russian and Austrian sides are 
quite denuded of troops, quite exposed and defenceless, will prove 
unable to keep up her present forces in France. She will at once 
lower her tone and become quite traitable. c 
Hence, if France holds out, if she improves the armistice to 
repair her forces, if she understands at last that in order to carry 
on a revolutionary war, revolutionary measures and revolutionary 
energy are wanted, she may still be saved. Bismarck knows 
perfectly that he is in a fix. He hopes to get out of it by 'bullying'. 
He confides in the cooperation of all reactionary elements of 
France.

has absolutely no funds for such purposes. The General Council 
was merely chosen by the subscribers as 'trustee' to ensure that the 
money was duly sent. Incidentally, no further evidence of receipt is 
necessary. 
On the subject of the articles on the German workers' 
movement which have appeared in English reviews, what Lieb­
knecht probably had in mind was the enclosed article on the 
International by Professor Beesly 3 which appeared in the 
November NUMBER (1870) of The Fortnightly Review. It may well be 
the passages from p. 531 on (I have put a mark to show where 
they begin)167 which Stieber wants to use to cook his  proof.  In the 
first place, Professor Beesly is not a member of the International 
and his statements are not authoritative for that reason. In the 
second place, he himself refutes Stieber's inferences. 
The letter I sent to the Brunswick peopleb  was not written in the

It was in fact a reply—and a long-deferred reply at that—to a 
letter asking me for my personal views. They were perfectly within 
their rights to ask for this. At least, I know of no § in the Penal 
Code that would proscribe it. At any rate, it is not Mr Bismarck's 
fault if 'my views' cannot be found printed in the Preussischer 
Staats-Anzeiger. The worthy Lothar Bucher did invite me after 
the heady days of Sadowa to write the financial column for that 
paper. More likely than not he took care not to publicise my 
reply. 168 
The German Empire is carrying on the campaign of the French 
Empire against the International Nothing is so characteristic of the 
last days of the latter empire as the legal persecution of members 
of the International because they waged war on the intended war. 
The secret papers of Mr Ollivier published by the Republic are 
very revealing in this respect. 169 
I was very pleased to receive your letter today. An article by me 
was to have appeared in The Fortnightly Review, but I shall 
postpone it for the time being, since the inability of the Prussian 
government to intervene here might be more than made good at the 
expense of friends there [in Germany], who are of course in

ENGELS TO KARL KLEIN AND FRIEDRICH MOLL 
IN SOLINGEN 
London, 10 March 1871 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
Dear Friends Klein and Moll, 
You must have been very surprised not to have received any 
reply to your letters of February last year. There were, however, a 
number of reasons for it. In the first place, I had hoped from one 
day to the next to be in a position to have something positive to 
say about the Association. But this turned out to be impossible and 
after the outbreak of the war it could no longer be expected. In 
the second place, your letter arrived in such a sorry state that I 
could be in no doubt that the postal authorities had been at pains 
to read it. So I waited for an opportune moment, particularly 
since the war, the state of siege and the many arrests. And, finally, 
I could not know whether both of you had not been conscripted 
into the Landwehr 11 during the war. 
An opportunity has now arisen to send a letter to Barmen, whence 
it could be passed on with little danger, and so I shall make use of it 
to give you a sign of life, and to enclose the promised portrait of

myself.  I have not yet been able to obtain one of Schapper who, as 
you know, died last year; as soon as I can lay hands on one, you 
shall have it. 
The German workers now have a hard time ahead of them; it 
seems to have been decided that they should be the victims whose 
sacrifice will provide the occasion for a reconciliation between 
Junker and bourgeoisie. But it doesn't matter. The workers' 
movement has become too powerful even in Germany to be 
snuffed out that easily by Prussian tricks. On the contrary, the 
persecutions we have to be prepared for will just give us greater 
strength, and when the bourgeois at present drunk with victory has 
overslept from intoxication and the hangover is beginning, a 
chance will arise for our party to raise its voice once more. At any 
rate,  the exemplary behaviour of the German workers during the 
war has demonstrated that they know what is at stake and that 
they alone, of all the parties, have a correct insight into the history 
of our age, whereas the bourgeois have really let victory go to 
their heads. 
I have been living here in London for the past five months. It 
seems doubtful whether you can continue for much longer to 
belong to the International Working Men's Association unless just 
in principle, since they seem to want to make it a criminal offence 
to be a member of that Association in Germany. At any rate, you 
may rest assured that having prepared the way for the association 
of the entire European and American proletariat over the past 
seven years, we shall take good care that it does not disintegrate 
whatever the circumstances. And that is the main thing. 
With fraternal greetings, 
Yours, 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO RUDOLF ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
London, 10 March 1871 
Dear  Rudolf, 
Since I am not yet acquainted with any lawyer here who is 
reliably informed or especially competent in commercial affairs, I 
have decided after some reflection that the best thing would be to 
write to the man in Manchester who made the contract with Funke 
on your  behalf.  I was quite clear in my mind about the issue at 
stake, but in matters of English law it is always better not to rely 
on common sense. However, on this occasion, the lawyer said: 
* law and common sense agree; the retirement of one of the partners 
in the German firm, from the German firm, in no way affects the 
firm in England, nor can the firm in England have any voice in the 
matter. On the other hand no member of the English firm can retire 
before the expiration of the term without the consent of the other 
members of the same concern.* 
Therefore (1) Adolf's3  position in the firm of R. Funke & Co. 
remains unaltered even though he has left the firm of Ermen 8c 
Engels in Barmen; and (2) his resignation from R. Funke & Co. 
requires not just his agreement, but also the agreement of Funke, a 
point that may not have occurred to you. 
Since these affairs affect  Adolf,  too, and since I cannot take 
sides on this matter, I am writing to him in the same terms to­
day. 
I purchased this information at a cost of 10/6d., which equals 
3.15 thalers, and would be glad if you could credit me with it. 
I find it quite natural that Adolf should want to retire from the 
business as soon as he can. The winter in Engelskirchen is 
fearfully boring and you will not take it amiss that he should long 
for some other entertainment than endless family drinking-
sessions. I am only astonished that he stood it there for so long; I 
would have kicked up a fuss much sooner and more often. It is all 
very well for you and Hermann b to talk, but you both jib at the 
idea of moving to Engelskirchen, and you cannot persuade me 
a Adolf Griesheim - b Hermann Engels

120 68. Engels to Rudolf Engels. 10 March 1871 
that it is just because you know nothing of the manufacturing 
process. You could learn it up after all, it would do you both 
good. Adolf can find many pleasant and congenial occupations for 
himself even without the business, and anyone who can do that is 
quite right to withdraw as quickly as possible. You must have been 
prepared for this eventuality long since, and if it now arises, it can 
only be in your interest for him to leave as soon as possible. I do 
not understand therefore how you should find such major 
grounds for complaint. Let Adolf go his own way, resolve the 
dispute as friends and make the necessary arrangements to meet 
the new situation, one which will give a higher percentage yield to 
each of you. 
Gottfrieda  will not suffer any great inconvenience; the old  MILL  in 
West Lane was empty and available, machinery is also easily 
procured. In Manchester one can get quite a few things done, etc., 
by other people, so you should not entertain any exaggerated 
hopes.  Moreover, it is self-evident that I am under a moral 
obligation not to do anything to harm a former associé who has 
given me a round sum in return for my own resignation. To what 
purpose then do you have agents and travellers? If they do their 
duty you do not need any further information. 
I rather doubt that the present sympathy with France (both here 
and fairly generally all over the world) stems from the fact that 
the French were given the greater thrashing. However, this much 
is certain: if the Prussians should be given another thrashing at a 
later stage (which is not at all improbable) people will laugh at 
them, rather than sympathise with them. The fact is that you 
cannot see beyond the end of your noses; but the hangover will 
follow the victory celebrations soon enough, and then you will find 
it hard to take much pleasure in yourselves. For all your power 
and glory you are as firmly 'in the thrall of Olmiitz' as ever. 
Olmütz was made in Warsaw, 170 where your sovereign lord, the 
Emperor of Russia,b commanded you to bow to Austria and the 
Federal Diet, and now that you have made sure that for many 
years to come France (which after all lies on your border) will 
remain your enemy, Russia will be your only protector and will 
soon make you pay for that protection. You are more firmly in the 
grip of Russian domination than ever before. 
Would you kindly give my motherc my warmest wishes and say 
that I shall be writing to her shortly. Give my regards to your wife

MARX TO PAUL LAFARGUEm 
IN BORDEAUX118 
London, 23 March 1871 
Dear Paul, 
I enclose Serraillier's declaration in the Courrier de l'Europe, 
18 March, 1871—(this French paper is published at London) in 
regard to the impudent mystification of the Paris-Journal of March 
14, of which you are probably aware. 17' 
The following is published in The Times of 22nd March 1871 
under the title ' The International Association': 
'M. Karl Marx asks us to contradict the statement contained in a 
letter published by us on the 16th of March, from our Paris 
correspondent, that 
"Karl Marx has written a letter to one of his principal affiliés in Paris, stating 
that he is not satisfied with the attitude which the members of that society have 
taken up in that city, that they violate the Statutes of the Association in dabbling in 
politics, that they disorganise labour instead of organising it, etc." 
'M. Karl Marx says this statement has evidently been taken from 
the Paris-Journal of the 14th of March, where also the publication 
in full of the pretended letter is promised, and that the 
Paris-Journal of the 19th of March contains a letter dated London, 
February 28, 1871, purporting to be signed by him, which letter 
M. Marx declares is from beginning to end an impudent forgery.'"

122 69. Marx to Paul Lafargue. 23 March 1871 
I come now to the second trick of that dirty Parisian reactionary 
press.  When we were informed of the pretended exclusion of the 
German 'Internationals' by the Paris 'Internationals', we wrote to the 
'frères et amis' at Paris, who replied that this story was nothing but 
an invention of the Paris press scum. Meanwhile, the false news 
spread like wildfire through the London press which indulged in 
long leaders upon that pleasant event proving at the same time the 
decomposition of the International and the incorrigible perversion 
of the Paris workmen. 
In to-day's Times (23 March, 1871) the following declaration of 
the General Council* is published: 
'The Anti-German League172 of Paris 
To the Editor of "The Times" 
'Sir, 
'A statement has gone the round of the English press that the 
Paris members of the International Working Men's Association 
had in so far joined the so-called Anti-German League as to 
declare all Germans to be henceforth excluded from our 
association. 
'This statement is the very reverse of fact. Neither the Federal 
Council of our association in Paris, nor any of the Paris sections 
represented by that council, have ever passed any such resolution. 
The so-called Anti-German League, as far as it exists at all, is the 
exclusive work of the upper and middle classes; it was started by 
the Jockey Club,173 and kept up by the adhesions of the Academy, 
of the Stock Exchange, of some bankers and manufacturers, etc. 
The working classes have nothing whatever to do with it. 
'The object of these calumnies is evident. A short time before 
the outbreak of the late war the International was made the 
general scapegoat for all untoward events. This is now repeated 
over again. While the Swiss and Prussian press accuse it of having 
created the late outrage upon Germans in Zurich,174  French 
papers, such as the Courrier de Lyon, Le Courrier de la Gironde, La 
Liberté, etc., tell of certain secret meetings of Internationals having 
been held at Geneva and Bern, the Prussian ambassador in the 
chair, in which meetings a plan was concocted to hand over Lyons 
to the united Prussians and Internationals for the sake of common 
plunder.

Your letter to Jenny has just arrived. It is not my youthful 
ardour, as you believe, but manifestoes published by the Federal 
Council of Paris during the war and communicated to us officially, 
that made the GENERAL COUNCIL believe in the possibility of such a 
foolish thing as the exclusion of the German Internationals by the 
Parisian Internationals! I have today sent to the Volksstaat in 
Leipzig (Liebknecht's newspaper) and the Zukunft in Berlin (Dr 
Jacoby's organ) a statement on the fantasies of the Paris-Journal 
and the alleged exclusion of the German Internationals by the 
Parisians, which has caused a great commotion in the German 
'bonne presse'} I concluded this statement with the words: 
'It is quite natural that the important dignitaries and the ruling 
classes of the old society who can only maintain their own power 
and the exploitation of the productive masses by national conflicts 
and antagonisms, recognise their common adversary in the 
International Working Men's Association.'

Dear Imandt, 
The 'letter' is a product of that trashy Paris paper, the 
Paris-Journal, in its issues of 14 and 19 March. 71 A statement from 
me in reply appeared in The Times on 22 March (a notice in small 
print just after the leading articles).3  That lousy paper has direct 
connections with the Prussian police. Its rédacteur en  chef, h the 
notorious Henri de Pêne, received two bullets in his body as a 
reward for his participation in the 'peaceable' procession of the 
parti de l'ordre. 11

Curiously enough the entire reactionary press in France printed 
the pseudo-letter. To give it more spice, the Paris-Journal 
published it under the high-faluting title: 'Le Grand Chef

ENGELS TO PHILIPPE COENEN 
IN ANTWERP 118 
[London,] 5 April 1871 
To Citizen Ph. Coenen, Antwerp 
Dear Citizen, 
As I already told you in my last letter,45 I felt it incumbent upon 
me to submit the contents of your letter concerning the strike of 
the cigar-workers to the Central" Council when it met yesterday 
evening.177 At the same time I requested the Council to afford our 
Antwerp members all possible help and support. 
In this I received vigorous support, more especially from Citizen 
Cohn, president of the London cigar-workers, who informed the 
Council that the cigar-workers of his Association had voted a loan 
of 150 pounds sterling, or about 3,750 francs, to their colleagues 
in Antwerp; that the Association of Belgian Cigar-workers 
employed over here had voted £20; that his Association proposed 
to urge another Association here, and that of the cigar-workers of 
Liverpool, to advance funds in support of the strike, etc. 
The Council then unanimously resolved: 
1. That an appeal to the English resistance societies in London 
and the provinces be immediately drafted, printed and despatched 
to all the associations, urging them to intervene on behalf of the 
Antwerp strikers. 
2. That deputations from the Council be sent to the big 
centralised associations in London, with whom we are in touch, to 
approach them with the same end in view. 
Having learned from Citizen Cohn that you had already taken 
the necessary steps to prevent the debouchment of Dutch 
cigar-workers by the Antwerp manufacturers and that similar 
attempts would not be successful here in England, all I could do 
on your behalf was to write a short note for our German journal, 
the Volksstaat of Leipzig, in which I relate the origins of the strike and 
urge the German cigar-workers to prevent any debouchment of 
workers for the [said] place, Antwerp, and, if possible, to advance 
you some funds to support the strike. b This note will be publish-

ed next week; in addition I asked the editor a to take up your 
cause. 
As to the success of these various moves, it is hard to judge in 
advance. Should the English associations consent to give us advances, 
several weeks will probably have to elapse before the necessary 
formalities can be completed. The German associations, having been 
ruined by the war, will hardly be in a position to advance any 
funds. 
In the meantime, please keep me informed of what is 
happening as regards the cigar-workers' strike, so that I shall be 
able to act if needs be, and without loss of time. Is it true, as 
Citizen Cohn has said, that the 300 cigar-workers of Brussels are 
also on strike? The Council has been told nothing about it and the 
Brussels people would be greatly to blame were this really the 
case;  for how are we to act if news is kept back from us? 
For some time copies of the Werker intended for the Council 
have failed to reach us. The General Council must be sent two 
copies of each of our journals, one for the library where a 
complete collection of all such journals is being made to help with 
the future history of the proletarian movement in all countries, 
the other for the secretary of the country where the journal 
appears. It would be a pity if De Werker were no longer to reach 
us, since we have always read it with close attention. 
The £150 should have been sent to you today. If it fails to arrive 
within 24 hours after receipt of this letter, kindly write without 
delay to Citizen Cohn, whose address you have got. 
I shall make it my business to do everything in my power for 
the Antwerp workers whom I have the honour to represent on the 
Council here; only please keep me properly informed about all 
that goes on.

It seems the Parisians are succumbing. It is their own fault but a 
fault which really was due to their too great honnêteté? The Central 
Committee and later the Commune gave that MISCHIEVOUS avorton, h 
Thiers, time to consolidate hostile forces, in the first place by their 
folly of not wanting to start a civil war—as if Thiers had not already 
started it by his attempt at forcibly disarming Paris, as if the National 
Assembly, summoned merely to decide the question of war or peace 
with the Prussians, had not immediately declared war on the 
Republic] Secondly, in order that the appearance of having usurped 
power should not attach to them, they lost precious moments (they 
should immediately have advanced on Versailles after the defeat 
(Place Vendôme) of the réactionnaires in Paris 175) by the election 
of the Commune, the organisation of which, etc., cost yet 
more time. 
You must not believe a word of all the stuff you get to see in the 
papers about the internal events in Paris. It is all lies and 
deception. Never has the vileness of the reptile bourgeois 
newspaper hacks displayed itself more splendidly. 
It is highly characteristic that the German Unity-Emperor,c 
Unity-Empire, and Unity-Parliament in Berlin appear not to exist at 
all for the outside world. Every breath of wind that stirs in Paris 
excites more interest. 
You should follow developments in the Danube Principalities 
with some care. If the revolution in France is defeated for the 
time being—the movement there can only be suppressed for a 
short time—Europe will have to face a new threat of war from the 
East, and Romania will be the first to present the orthodox Tsard 
with a pretext. So keep an eye on events there. 
One of the most comical phenomena in London is undoubtedly 
that ex-student Karl Blind. The self-important fellow eagerly 
seized on the recent war to show off his pan-Germanic allegiance. 
He was the first to start screaming for Alsace-Lorraine. He even 
had the impudence to deny the great revolutionary activities of the 
French people in the past. The scoundrel even ventured to warn 
the local workers not to incur the hostility of workers in Germany by 
their sympathy for France against Prussia! Each week this 
gentleman composes a report describing the activities of Karl 
Blind and sends it to all the London papers, two or three of which 
are actually so foolish as to print these bulletins of, about and for 
Karl Blind. If this system is applied consistently, one cannot fail to 
force oneself on the public in the end. In this manner this weighty

personage  has  managed  to delude  a section  of local public opinion 
into believing that  he plays  the  same sort  of role  in Germany  as 
Mazzini used  to in  Italy.  In his  bulletins  he recounts what Karl 
Blind  had  announced  in the  Viennese Freie Presse,  and how the 
whole  of Germany looked forward  to his  oracular utterances with 
bated breath  and  anxiously awaited  for  Karl Blind  to deliver 
himself  of the  watchword  for the  week.  Now it  would  be extremely 
desirable—since this individual, this puffed-up frog, does make  us 
Germans here ridiculous—if  you  people  in the  Volksstaat could 
publish  a few  home truths about  the  fellow  and his  'complete 
unimportance'. 180 We  would ensure that  a translation appeared  in 
The Eastern Post  (a London workers' paper).  It is  quite simple. 
Karl Blind does  not exist  in the  eyes  of the  German working class, 
and a republican German middle  class,  whose MOUTHPIECE  he pretends 
to be,  does  not  exist anywhere  and  hence cannot exist  for  Karl 
Blind either.  HE  IS NOWHERE.  While such figures should  not be  taken 
seriously,  it is no  less true that they should  not be  allowed  to 
delude the public  ON FALSE PRETENCES.

74 
MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 137 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, [around 10 April] 3 1871 
Dear Wilhelm, 
Just two notices in great haste which you could surely arrange to 
put into the Volksstaat: 
1. In the Papiers et correspondance de la famille impériale, now 
officially published, there is a reference under the letter V (the 
recipients of money are arranged alphabetically ) which states verbo 
tenus : 
'Vogt— il lui est remis en août 1859 40,000 francs.' c 
2. Whereas the Bismarck government in Germany has made 
correspondence with me into a more or less highly penal affair 
(vide the Brunswick trial, 183 just like the Cologne Communist trial 
of earlier years  138), in France it attempts to discredit me (and with 
me the International in Paris—that is the aim of the whole 
manoeuvre) by branding me as one of Mr Bismarck's agents. This is 
done through the organs of the old-Bonapartist police which is 
still entwined by international bonds with Stieber's police— 
particularly under the Thiers regime. 
In consequence I have been compelled to publish denials in The 
Times of various lies that have appeared in the Paris-Journal, the 
Gaulois, and so on, because the rubbish is reported to the English 
press by telegraph. 171 The latest example was provided by the Soir 
(the paper of About, the well-known Plonplonist d), which has only 
very recently been suppressed by the Commune, and from the 
Soir it circulated to all the French reactionary press throughout 
the provinces. E.g. today I received from Laura  (BY  THE BY, 
Lafargue is at this moment in Paris as a delegate from Bordeaux) 
the following extract from the paper La Province (and yesterday I 
received the same piece from a clerical newspaper in Belgium):

MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 121 
IN HANOVER 
London, 12 April 1871 
Dear Kugelmann, 
Your 'doctor's orders' were effective insofar as I consulted my 
Dr Maddison and have for the present put myself under his 
treatment. He says, however, that my lungs are in excellent 
condition and the coughing is connected with bronchitis, etc. Ditto, 
it may affect the liver. 
Yesterday we received the by no means reassuring news that 
Lafargue (not Laura) is in Paris at the moment. 
If you look at the last chapter of my Eighteenth Brumaire you 
will find that I say that the next attempt of the French revolution 
will be no longer, as before, to transfer the bureaucratic military 
machine from one hand to another, but to break it, and that is 
essential for every real people's revolution on the Continent. And 
this is what our heroic Party comrades in Paris are attempting. 
What resilience, what historical initiative, what a capacity for 
sacrifice in these Parisians! After six months of hunger and ruin, 
caused rather by internal treachery than by the external enemy, 
they rise, beneath Prussian bayonets, as if there had never been a 
war between France and Germany and the enemy were not still at 
the gates of Paris! History has no like example of a like greatness.

If they are defeated only their 'decency' will be to blame. They 
should have marched at once on Versailles, after first Vinoy and 
then the reactionary section of the Paris National Guard had 
themselves retired from the battlefield. The right moment was 
missed because of conscientious scruples. They did not want to 
start the civil war, as if that MISCHIEVOUS avorton 3 Thiers had not 
already started the civil war with his attempt to disarm Paris! 
Second mistake: The Central Committee surrendered its power 
too soon, to make way for the Commune. 184 Again from a too 
'honourable' scrupulousness! However that may be, the present 
rising in Paris—-even if it be crushed by the wolves, swine and vile 
curs of the old society—is the most glorious deed of our Party 
since the June Insurrection in Paris.1 Compare these Parisians, 
storming the heavens, with the slaves to heaven of the German-
Prussian Holy Roman Empire, with its posthumous masquerades 
reeking of the barracks, the Church, the cabbage Junkers and 
above all, of the philistines. 
Apropos. In the official publication* of the list of those receiving 
direct subsidies from Louis Bonaparte's treasury there is a note 
that Vogt received 40,000 francs in August 1859! I have informed 
Liebknecht of the fait, for further use. c 
You can send me the Haxthausen,d because recently I have 
received various pamphlets, etc., undamaged, not only from 
Germany, but even from Petersburg. 
Thanks for the various newspapers you have been sending (I 
would ask you for more, as I want to write something about 
Germany, the Reichstag, etc.).

MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 185 
IN LEIPZIG 
[London,] 13 April 1871 
Dear Liebknecht, 
You may make use of the 80 thalers either for your family, or 
for the Volksstaat. 3 Both are 'victims' of the recent war. 
I do not have the Freiligrath poem; it came out in 1852 and 
appeared also in Cotta's Morgenblatt which you can perhaps 
unearth in Leipzig. 186 
I do not think it would be useful to reprint items from the 
Revue der Rheinischen Zeitung without introductions, additions, etc., 
and this is hardly the time for that. 187 
Engels asks me to tell you that his essay in the Deutsch-
Französische Jahrbücher h is now only of historical interest and so no 
longer has any value as practical propaganda. On the other hand, 
you could print more extensive excerpts from Capital, e.g. extracts 
from the chapter on 'Primitive Accumulation', 188 etc. 
Miquel was in the Leaguec and threw his weight about in the 
Kingdom of Hanover as the League's District Adviser Extraordi­
nary. You can print that, but leave my name out of it, since I have 
to keep the 'secret' unless directly forced by Miquel [to reveal it]. 
'Bid me not speak, bid me be silent 
To keep the secret I am bound.'d 
The Communist Manifesto cannot of course appear without a 
new preface. Engels and I will see what can be done about it. 
My kind regards to your dear wife. e

Dear Liebknecht, 
It is absolutely out of the question for you to reprint my old 
article from the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher in the Volksstaat. 3 It 
is by now quite obsolete and full of inaccuracies that could only 
confuse people. Moreover, it was still written in a Hegelian style 
which likewise just will not do nowadays. Its sole value is as an 
historical document.

Dear Kugelmann, 
Your letter arrived all right. At the moment I have my hands 
full. So only a few words. How you can compare petty-bourgeois 
demonstrations à la 13 June 1849, 191 etc., with the present 
struggle in Paris is quite incomprehensible to me. 
World history would indeed be very easy to make if the struggle 
were taken up only on condition of infallibly favourable chances.

It would, on the other hand, be of a very mystical nature, if 
'accidents' played no part. These accidents themselves fall natural­
ly into the general course of development and are compensated 
again by other accidents. But acceleration and delay are very 
dependent upon such 'accidents', which include the 'accident' of 
the character of those who first stand at the head of the 
movement. 
The decisively unfavourable 'accident' this time is by no means 
to be found in the general conditions of French society, but in the 
presence of the Prussians in France and their position right before 
Paris.  Of this the Parisians were well aware. But of this, the 
bourgeois canaille of Versailles were also well aware. Precisely for 
that reason they presented the Parisians with the alternative of 
taking up the fight or succumbing without a struggle. In the latter 
case,  the demoralisation of the working class would have been a 
far greater misfortune than the fall of any number of 'leaders'. 
The struggle of the working class against the capitalist class and its 
state has entered upon a new phase with the struggle in Paris. 
Whatever the immediate results may be, a new point of departure 
of world-historic importance has been gained. 
Adio.

Dear Liebknecht, 
I must tell you today in all haste about the so-called 
INTERNATIONAL  DEMOCRATIC  ASSOCIATION,192 which you may well never 
have heard of and which, therefore, might be confused with us. 

=====第172页=====
138 79. Engels to Liebknecht. 20 April 1871 
The association is a caricature of the IWMA. It has vegetated in 
obscurity here for a number of years, but expresses its desire, 
from time to time, to present itself to a wider public, i.e. to make 
itself ridiculous, exhibiting at the same time a certain secondary 
tendency to let itself quietly be mistaken for the IWMA. Since 
these people again held a meeting on the Paris Commune in Hyde 
Park last Sunday3 —a meeting which under their auspices was 
inevitably doomed to failure (they even let it be known that we had 
sent delegates, even though, when they sent a deputation to us, we 
roundly refused to do so)—and since they now also intend to 
establish branches on the Continent and will presumably send 
deputations to you as well, it has become necessary to make you 
acquainted with them. In the first place, there is Weber, that old 
trouble-maker from the Palatinate, whom you know; and secondly, 
Le Lubez, whom you have also come across. I enclose a cutting in 
which they present their muddled programme to the world in 
muddled language. Insofar as it is comprehensible, it is purely 
bourgeois; what they have to say on the subject of providing work 
and, alternatively, of making provision for those unable to work, is 
already fulfilled by the English Poor Law. 193 They take good care 
not to say a word about capital and labour. The NATIONALISATION OF 
LAND is so universally accepted here that they cannot evade it, and 
in itself is so little in conflict with bourgeois interests that only the 
day before yesterday a Tory who has his million thalers in safe 
keeping told me that he was in favour of it. Weber is also, as you 
know, a supporter of Heinzen and a pure 'democrat'. 
As long as these fellows pursued their activities in obscurity 
here,  we left them to themselves, but if they choose to expand, 
conflicts will be unavoidable and we shall then have to hit them 
where it hurts. 
So the Volksstaat was confiscated again yesterday for lèse majesté, 
as we hear on the telegraph. 194 I am astonished that it did not 
happen earlier. You are extremely impudent. But 'after all, this is 
only right and proper', as Frederick II used to say. 
The Vogt story b should be kept alive for a while. It is evident 
from the context that Karl Vogt is the only Vogt who can be 
meant. In the first place, no other Vogt is so well known as to be 
referred to as Vogt, tout court, without first name and address. In 
the second place, what other Vogt performed such valuable 
services at that time for the Bonaparte family that he should have 
been given 40,000 frs in August, i.e. immediately after the 
a 16 April - b See this volume, p. 130.

conclusion  of the  Italian campaign? Moreover,  the  formula,  'il lui 
a été  remis  en  Août 1859',' indicates that  he had  received other 
remittances.  The  more frequently  you  return  to the  point,  the 
more  the  bourgeois press, which suppresses  all this, will find itself 
forced  to take note  of it. You  might also bring  it to the  attention 
of the  Proletarier  and the  Volkswille. 
Since experience  has  taught  me  that Stieber's agents  are as 
clumsy  at opening letters  as they  are at  fabricating conspiracies,  I 
hereby inform  you  once  and for all  that  all my  letters  to you are 
securely sealed with  my  seal  and the  initials  F. E. in Gothic script. 
The Prussians cannot  yet in all  decency break open sealing-wax  on 
rubber,  and  certainly  not so  that  it cannot  be noticed. Mostly they 
just tear open  the  side  of the  envelope with their oafish fists.  So if 
my seal  is not  clear  and  legible  you  will know what  has  happened. 
It will  at any  rate infuriate  the  fellows  to have  to let a  letter 
addressed  to you and  with  F. E. on the  seal pass through their 
hands unbroken. 
It is time  for the  post  and I  still have  all sorts  of things  to tell 
you,  but I  must  end now.

[London, around 26 April 1871] 
Dear Citizen! 199 
I have been authorised by the General Council to issue a most 
emphatic denial on its behalf of the foul slander being spread by 
Citizen F. Pyat against Serraillier.3 Pyat's fury springs from one 
single source: his hatred for the International. Through the so-called 
French Section in London,50 which has been expelled by the 
General Council, and which has been infiltrated by police spies, 
one-time imperial guardsmen and touts, Pyat has been trying to 
pose before the world as the secret leader of our Association, to 
which he does not belong, and to make us responsible for his 
absurd manifestations in London and his compromising indiscre­
tions in Paris, which, by the way, Citizen Tridon has already flayed 
during his stay in Brussels.200 That is why the General Council was 
forced to disown this dirty schemer publicly.b  Hence his furies 
against Dupont and Serraillier. When Serraillier threatened to 
summon the vile toadies of Pyat in the so-called French Section 
before an English court to answer for the slander Pyat keeps 
spreading in Paris, the French Section itself disowned them and 
branded them as slanderers. 
One of these days, the General Council is to issue an Address on 
the Commune.196 It has put off this manifesto up to now, because 
it was expecting the Paris Section from day to day to supply it with 
precise information. In vain! Not a word! The Council could not 
afford to wait any longer because the English workers have been 
eagerly awaiting its explanation. 
Meanwhile, time has not been wasted. The true character of this 
grand Paris revolution has been explained to workers everywhere 
in letters from various secretaries to sections on the Continent and 
in the United States. 
Since Serraillier's political life has given no occasion for slander,c 
it was his private life that was attacked. Had Pyat's private life 
been as clean as Serraillier's, he would not have had to submit 
a Crossed out in the original: "representative of the Council'. - b  See K. Marx,

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN

London, 28 April 1871

Dear Kugelmann, 
You can see from the above address that I have settled in 
London and have in fact been here since last autumn when I 
finally wound up my various business obligations in Manchester. I 
am happy with the move in every respect. My new house is not 
quite ten minutes away from Marx, which is very close indeed 
according to ideas here. Moreover, I have the park directly 
opposite the door and splendid fresh air. 
As far as Marx' condition is concerned, you saw the situation in 
altogether too gloomy a light. D'abordc your bold diagnosis which 
blamed his cough on catarrh on the lungs. Marx and I have 
consulted a very able young doctord (a Scot), who knows his 
auscultation and percussion as well as most in Germany, and who 
says the same as I have been saying all along: that the source of 
the cough is solely in the larynx and that the lungs are completely 
unaffected. He says that it is, however, not easy to get rid of a 
cough that has been so greatly neglected and which has therefore 
become so firmly entrenched, and he prophesies a recurrence in 
a Crossed out in the original: 'public affronts to which he was submitted in London by 
several', 'by a French worker', 'Résumé: Serraillier's crime consists in his persistent 
efforts to baffle the'. This is followed by a gap in the original. - b Crossed out in the

the autumn, even if the summer drives it away. Given proper 
treatment, however, he says there is no cause for concern. The 
only trouble with the cough to begin with was that it prevented 
Marx from sleeping and so brought about a general deterioration 
in his health. That has now been attended to more or less. The 
doctor has mainly been treating his liver and there too he has had 
some success. You will understand, however, that there can be no 
speedy cure for a chronic illness that, to my knowledge, has been 
more or less permanent for the last 26 years. Incidentally, Marx's 
way of life is by no means as crazy as people imagine. While the 
excitement that started with the war still persists, he has given up 
work on heavy theoretical matters and is living fairly rationally; he 
even frequently takes his  1 V2 hour to 2 hour walks without my 
forcing him to and he does not drink a drop of beer for weeks on 
end as soon as he notices that it doesn't agree with him. That he 
has a capricious appetite which alternates between lack of appetite 
and ravenous hunger is not surprising in his condition. You need 
have no fear that his skin is not in order—apart from the 
considerable areas where the CUTIS has been completely destroyed 
by the carbuncles. A walk via Highgate to Hampstead and back to 
Maitland Park is about  1 V2 German miles and involves going up 
and down several steep hills. And up on top there is more ozone 
than in the whole of Hanover. He goes for this walk 3-4 times per 
week, at least in part. Naturally, I often have to make him do it, 
but he knows that it is good for him. And in general, like me, he 
lives circa 150 feet above the Thames in an open district, with 
hardly a hint of urban atmosphere, among large gardens and few 
houses, and if matters are not worse with him, it can be put down 
to this healthy environment. 
I have just been called to the table and, since the crazy postal 
system closes down in half-an-hour, I shall have to break off. At 
any rate I have given you enough material to counteract your 
somewhat exaggerated fears. The fact is that I cannot bear to be 
without a lot of exercise out of doors and, whether he wants to or 
not, Marx mostly has to come along with me, and that is after all 
the best medicine for him. 
With warm regards, 
Yours, 
F. E.

MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
[London,] 4 MAY 1871 
Dear LIBRARY,3 
Just this in great haste. 
The Papiers et  correspondance  de la famille impériale, in which Vogt 
figures among others as someone who was subsidised from the 
official coffers, b were not published by the Commune, which has no 
time for such trivia, but by the gouvernement de la défense, i.e. by 
Jules Favre et Co., the honest republicans so greatly admired by 
Vogt in his letters to Kolb. 201 
Extracts from these official publications (and particularly the 
names of those who received subsidies) were printed in almost all the 
Paris papers. The cutting I enclose comes from the Petit Journal 
(issue of 3 May 187Ie ), a paper which to this very day is 
conducting in Paris the same sort of campaign against the 
Commune as Signor Vogt in Vienna. From a sense of spiritual 
affinity with Vogt it even prints a (?) after his name. 
Meanwhile, Vogt himself retracts all his talk when he says at the 
end of his gibberish: 
'It is even possible that my name was misused as far back as 1859, albeit, so it 
seems, without my first name Karl.'d 
So Louis Bonaparte misused 'Vogt' by inscribing his name in his 
expenses-book! 'Vogt' as someone subsidised by Louis Bonaparte 
in August 1859—and moreover, just plain 'Vogt', Vogt without 
'first name', Vogt sans phrase—naturally, that could only be the 
'celebrated' Karl Vogt of Geneva! Mr Vogt is so well aware of that 
that he says 'my name was misused'. The good man feels so stung 
that he forgets to have recourse to the simple evasion: Just as 
there are many 'Karls' in the world, so too are there many 'Vogts'. 
What does it matter to me if some 'Vogt' or other without a first 
name received 40,000 frs in August 1859 from the Emperor's 
central treasury? No, says Vogt, I am the Vogt, the Vogt to whom

great German cigar-workers' STRIKE, they had sent a contribution of 
3,000 frs in support. The STRIKE in Antwerp and Brussels is still in 
progress "7  and, if this story of the 3,000 frs is correct, it would 
damn-well be the responsibility of the Germans to pay it back. 
Please, try to find out about it and, depending on the result, write 
something on it briefly in the Volksstaat. 
We have greatly enjoyed Bebel's speeches and articles here. His 
speech in the debate on Basic Rights was excellent,203 and the 
elegant superiority with which he, a worker, poured ridicule 
on the assortment of priests, Junkers and bourgeois, was really 
by far the best thing that has yet happened in the entire Berlin 
spittoon. 
We heard with pleasure that you were going to visit us soon. 
You can, of course, stay both with me and with Marx; we shall 
arrange all that.

Dear Liebknecht, 
Yesterday evening when your letter arrived, I wrote at once and 
made  A MISTAKE.  The date of the Petit Journal with the reference to 
Vogt is 25 March 1871? This date is important. The Journal, like 
other Paris papers, had begun to publish the list of those 
subsidised long before the revolution of 18 March, and continued 
to do so after it. It finished doing so on 25 March with the list of 
people whose names began with 'V.

ENGELS TO HERMANN JUNG 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 10 May 1871 
Dear Jung, 
The subject in question has been talked over many times 
previously between Marx and myself and again to-night204 —we 
cannot come to any other conclusion but that there are only two 
candidates likely to take the place that can be taken into 
consideration, viz. Hales and Mottershead. What you say about 
Hales is quite correct and if he was proposed, it might be made a 
condition that he should get himself cleared in a more satisfactory 
way than he has done hitherto—as to his being an overlooker, so 
is Dupont, and so long as he behaves straight otherwise, that, 
though a little unpleasant, should not be an absolute bar. We think 
him, on the whole, preferable to Mottershead whose temper does 
not perhaps fit him so well for successful agitation among the 
London masses and that ought to be the principal occupation of 
the Secretary.—As to the ignorance of the languages, that is a 
thing that cannot be helped so long as you yourself are not in a 
position to take the office which 1 am afraid you are not; so we 
shall have to take an Englishman. On the one hand I do not 
consider the absence of linguistic knowledge a serious impediment 
under our present organisation; on the other this very cir­
cumstance might be the means to define more clearly the position 
of the Secretary which hitherto appears to be rather uncertain. To 
draw up the minutes and to carry on the correspondence with the 
English branches; at the same time to spread the Association 
amongst the masses of London and to render it independent of 
the aristocracy of the working classes and its acknowledged 
leaders,—if we could find a man capable and willing of doing that, 
we should probably get more consideration for our 15/- than 
hitherto. 205 We must not forget that the office to be filled up is not 
that of 'General Secretary' to the Association, as Eccarius chose to 
call himself,  but merely Secretary to the General Council, an office 
which confines his official duties to those performed in the 
Council meetings and to the correspondence with English 
branches (English-American only by special resolution as far as I 
know);  that is to say he is at the same time Secretary for Great

Britain and as such has to keep up the agitation in this country 
which Eccarius never did and which yet is very important. This 
latter portion of his duties Marx and I consider the most 
important. 
However, you will have to talk the matter over and see what can 
be done. 
At all events here you have our opinion (confidentially of 
course) as you asked for it; there is no hurry, perhaps it might be 
as well merely to come to a provisional arrangement, but that will 
be for your committee to decide, as well as all the rest. 
Very truly yours, 
F. Engels

MARX TO LÉO FRANKEL AND LOUIS EUGÈNE VARLIN 207 
IN PARIS 
[Draft] [London,] 13  MAY  1871 
Dear Citizens Frankel and Varlin, 
I have had a number of interviews with the bearer.3 
Might it not be useful if all papers likely to compromise the 
riffraff of Versailles were kept in a safe place?b A precaution of 
this kind could never do any harm. 
They have written to me from Bordeaux to say that four 
Internationalists have been elected at the last municipal elec-

tions.208  The provinces are beginning to ferment. Unfortunately 
their action is localised and 'pacific'. 
I have written hundreds of letters on behalf of your cause to all 
the corners of the earth where we have branches. The working 
class was, incidentally, pro-Commune since the latter's incep­
tion. 
Even the bourgeois papers in this country have departed from 
their earlier ferocity. From time to time I contrive to slip a 
favourable paragraph into them.3 
I believe that the Commune wastes too much time over trifles 
and personal squabbles. One can see that there are influences at 
work other than those of the working men. None of this would 
matter if you had time enough to make up for lost time. 
It is very necessary to do quickly what you intend to do outside 
Paris,  in England or elsewhere. The Prussians won't hand over the 
forts to the Versailles people, but after the definitive conclusion of 
peace (26 MAY209)b they will allow the government to invest Paris 
with its gendarmes. Since Thiers & Co. had, as you know, 
stipulated a handsome bribe in their treaty concluded by 
Pouyer-Quertier,210 they refused to accept Bismarck's offer of 
assistance by German bankers. Had they done so, they would have 
forfeited their bribe. Since the prior condition for the accomplish­
ment of their treaty was the conquest of Paris, they asked 
Bismarck to delay payment of the first instalment until the 
occupation of Paris. Bismarck accepted this condition. Prussia, 
being herself in urgent need of that money, will therefore provide 
the Versailles people with every possible facility to hasten the 
occupation of Paris. So be on your guard!

MARX TO EDWARD SPENCER BEESLY 211 
IN LONDON 
London, 12 June 1871 
1 Maitland Park Road, N.W. 
My dear Sir, 
Lafargue, his family and my daughters are in the Pyrenees near 
the Spanish border but on the French side of it. 212 As Lafargue 
was born in Cuba he was able to obtain a Spanish passport. I wish 
however he would definitely settle on the Spanish side, as he 
played a leading role in Bordeaux. 
Despite my admiration for your articles in the Bee-Hive,213 I am 
almost sorry to see your name in that newspaper. Permit me to 
observe in passing that as a Party man I take up an entirely hostile 
attitude towards Comtism,214 while as a scholar I have a very poor 
opinion of it; I regard you however as the only Comtist, both in 
England and in France, who deals with historical turning points 
(CRISES) not as a sectarian but as an historian in the best sense of 
the word. The Bee-Hive pretends to be a workers' paper but it 
is really the organ of renegades, sold to Sam. Morley & Co. 
During the recent Franco-Prussian war, the General Council of the 
International was obliged to sever all connection with this paper 
and publicly to declare that it was a workers' paper only 
in appearance.215 The big London papers, however, with 
the exception of the local London Eastern Post, refused to print 
this declaration.3 In such circumstances your cooperation with 
the Bee-Hive is a further sacrifice you are making to the good 
cause. 
A woman friend of mineb will be going to Paris in three or 
four days. I am giving her regular passports for some members 
of the Commune who are still hiding in Paris.0 If you or one 
of your friends have any commissions there please write to 
me. 
What comforts me is the nonsense which the petite presse 0 
publishes every day about my writings and my relations with the

Commune; this is sent to me each day from Paris. It shows that 
the Versailles police is very hard put to it to get hold of genuine 
documents. My relations with the Commune were maintained 
through a German merchant 3 who travels on business between 
Paris and London all the year round. Everything was settled 
verbally with the exception of two matters: 
First, through the same intermediary I sent the members of 
the Commune a letter in answer to a question from them as 
to how they could sell certain securities on the London Ex­
change.1" 
Second, on 11 May, ten days before the catastrophe, I sent them 
via the same channel all the details of the secret agreement 
between Bismarck and Favre in Frankfurt. 216 
I had this information from Bismarck's right hand—a manc 
who had formerly (from 1848 to 1853) belonged to a secret society 
of which I was the leader.217  This man knows that I still have all 
the reports which he sent me from and about Germany. He is 
dependent on my discretion. Hence his continual efforts to prove 
to me his good intentions. It is the same man who, as I told 
you, had warned me that Bismarck was determined to have 
me arrested if I again visited Dr Kugelmann in Hanover this 
year. 
If only the Commune had listened to my warnings! I advised its 
members to fortify the northern side of the heights of 
Montmartre, the Prussian side, and they still had time to do this; I 
told them beforehand that they would otherwise be caught in a 
trap;  I denounced Pyat, Grousset and Vésinier to them; I 
demanded that they should at once send to London all the 
documents compromising the members of the National Defence, 
so that by this means the savagery of the enemies of the 
Commune could to some extent be held in check—thus the plan 
of the Versailles people would at least partially have been 
frustrated. 
If the Versailles people had discovered these documents, they 
would not have published forged ones. 
The "Address" of the International11 will not be published befo­
re Wednesday.e I shall then send you a copy at once. Material for 
four to five sheets has been compressed into two. Hence the

Dear  Sir, 
I shall  be happy  to see to the  'first chapter',  but I  cannot start 
work  on it for  another  two  weeks. 218 A period  of illness lasting eight 
weeks  has  piled  up  work which  has to be  dealt with first.  I shall 
then also send  you a  list of minor corrections.3 
As to the  continuation  of my  work,  the  report  OF OUR  FRIEND 11 is 
based  on a  misunderstanding.  I have decided that  a complete 
revision  of the  manuscript  is necessary.219 Moreover, even  now a 
number  of essential  DOCUMENTS  are  still outstanding, which will 
eventually arrive from the  UNITED STATES.0 
*Our friend must return  to London from  his  commercial 
expedition.  I have received news from  the  correspondents  of the 
firm for  which  he travels, from Switzerland  and  elsewhere.  The 
business will  be ruined  if he  defers  his  return,  and he  himself will 
be disabled  for all  time  to do any  further service  to the  firm.  The 
competitors  of the  firm  are  informed,  are  looking about  for him 
and will ensnare  him  with their intrigues.  * 22° 
My best thanks  for the  various Russian books which you were  so

[London,] 13 June 1871 
My dear children, 
After a 6 weeks' illness I am all right again, so far as this is 
possible under present circumstances. Besides, the devil is let loose 
in the house which is whitewashing, oiling, painting, papering, 
everything topsy-turvy. During the last days the noise and the 
continued expulsion from one corner to another got the better of 
my nervous system, and I have lived more at the general's13 house 
than at ours. 
I wish to have fuller notice about Jenny's health. I fear to have 
read between the lines that she is not quite as she ought to be. 
Now, generally speaking, after consultation with doctors of 
notorious sagacity, and in possession of full information, I think all of 
you ought to leave the French for the Spanish side of the 
Pyrenees.222 The climate is much better, the change you all stand 
in need of much more marked. As to Toole,c in particular, his 
health will deteriorate and may even incur great danger, if he any 
longer hesitates to follow the advice of medical men who know 
everything about his constitution and have besides consulted his Yours sincerely,

former doctors at Bordeaux, etc. Hence, I expect that you will not 
care for a little trouble, resort to a more healthy place, and soon 
send me your new address whither I would send you my new 
'address'.3 
Here in London life is just now dull enough. The cousins from 
the countryb are thronging its streets. You recognise them at once 
by their bewildered airs, their astonishment at everything they see 
and their feverish anxiety at the convolution of horses, cabs, 
omnibuses, people, babies, and dogs. 
Mamma and Madame Lormier—as I hear—are fighting hard 
battles about politics. I do not know whether they have already 
come to blows, or whether they confine themselves to hard words, 
which will break no bones. 
I have got from St Petersburg very valuable books and very 
friendly letters in which all sorts of advances are made to me.c 
Lawroff (not Anoroff) is a good fellow enough, not at all 
without capacity, but he has spoiled his brain and lost his time, by 
reading throughout the last 20 years mainly the German literature 
(philosophical, etc.) of that period, the lousiest sort of literature in 
existence. Being German, he seems to have fancied, it must needs 
be 'scientific'. 
Mrs Vivanti has come it out strongly, it seems. I have not seen 
her, but I remark, that now she is spoken of in terms of praise, 
perhaps a little exaggerated, but in the family Cutts there runs, as 
you know, a vein of extravagance. 
Jung's sister-in-law has been buried the day before yesterday. 
Poor girl! She died in a hospital. 
The little 'master'd is excellent in everything essential. So you 
may bear with his little weaknesses, his loquacity, his  self-
complacency, and the rehearsal of the 'happy speeches' he made 
here and there. 
The German 'Knoten'-patriots,e  of course, have celebrated in 
Bolleter's Gardens the 'glorious' upshot of the Borusso-French 
war by a 'Friedensfest' g in which, more teutonico, h they have not 
failed 'sich blutig zu keilen'.'

ENGELS TO ELISABETH ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
London, 16 June 1871 
Dear Mother, 
I was just sitting down to write to you when your letter from 
Leutesdorf arrived, which moved me to take out the map from 
which I was fortunate enough to discover the place. It must be 
very prettily situated, just there where the mountains come right 
up close to the Rhine again, with a view of the plain which 
stretches from Andernach to Koblenz. I am sure that the air there 
will have been very good for you. 
You have done well to take a whole party of lively young girls 
home with you to Engelskirchen. Relations between the two 
adjoining houses b must be rather tense and embarrassing under 
the circumstances, and the presence of the girls will make sure 
that it is not talked about too much. Moreover, since the matter 
has now been settled it would be only right and proper for both 
sides to leave you in peace; it cannot do any good to keep raking 
over the ashes. As far as I am concerned, it was extremely 
unpleasant for me to find myself suddenly asked by Rudolf to do 
a favour for him, Hermann and Emil which I could not carry out 
without taking sides against  Adolf.  As you know, Rudolf is as 
honest as the day is long and is quite unable to dissemble, so that 
his letter did not leave me in the slightest doubt that the whole 
a Marx's family nickname - b  An allusion to the relations between Engels' 
brothers—Rudolf, Emil and Hermann—on the one hand, and Adolf von Griesheim, 
the husband of Engels' sister, on the other.

thing was to be arranged behind Adolf's back. However, Adolf 
had just as great a right to the information requested as the three 
others. I found the whole business so unpleasant that at first I just 
neglected it, but when they bombarded me with letters, I had to 
take a decision and in my view I could not do otherwise than to 
inform Adolf of the matter as well, since it was of great 
importance to him. To leave them time to make amends, I wrote 
to thema saying that I would write to Adolf and I did not in fact 
write to him until some days later.45 I am at a loss to understand 
why they did not at once tell Adolf they had approached me and 
inform him of my reply. Had they done so all would have been 
well. But for them to obtain information behind Adolf's back 
which could be used against him, was something I could not be a 
party to. And that this was the intention is proved by Rudolf's 
subsequent letter to me. And in general Rudolf thought it a crime 
that Adolf should want to leave the firm at all, and since I had 
myself resigned only a short while earlier,223 this seemed to me to 
go too far. Fortunately, the whole business is now settled and I 
hope they will soon make it up. I am writing to Adolf who has 
asked me for an account of the disagreements in Manchester and 
shall say to him that the most rational thing for them to do would 
be, either at the signing of the definitive contract, or even sooner, 
to give back to each other all the letters exchanged on the subject, 
throw them into the fire and drink a bottle of champagne. 
As for my coming on a visit, that is a separate problem. As you 
know, ever since the business in Paris, there has been general 
hounding of us "Internationals"; we are supposed to have incited 
the whole revolution here from London, which is much the same 
as if someone were to accuse me of having stirred up the 
ill-feeling between Adolf and my brothers. But the hue and cry is 
on and we have definite information that Marx, who was expected 
in Hanover, would have been arrested there. True, they could not 
do me any serious harm if I did go over, but there could be minor 
conflicts, and I wouldn't have it for the world that they should 
take place in your house. Furthermore, the wretched Belgians still 
insist on passports. I think therefore that it would be best to wait a 
while until the police and the philistine heads have calmed down a 
little. 
That is a strange business with Emma.b You seem to have 
curious accoucheurs in Barmen.

We have also had a lot of east wind here, but not until late 
May, so that the weather was often very fine and not excessively 
cold. Nevertheless, a fire had to be lit a few times early in June. It 
has been sultry since the day before yesterday, and there has been 
heavy rain which was very good for the plants, and it looks now as 
if we shall soon have fine weather. On the whole we had a very 
pleasant spring here, much better than in Manchester. I often 
have visitors from there. The day before yesterday, Dr Gumpert 
and his wife were here. She was puzzled about what I did with 
such a large house but was full of praise for the good order in 
which it was kept. Otherwise I have my usual good health and 
appetite, am now trying to accustom myself to an afternoon nap, 
am visibly greyer in the beard, and suffer, as always, almost only 
from thirst. I hope that you are also well and still able to take your 
walks in the linden avenue on the Agger, where I hope quite soon 
to be able to lie down again on a bench after a meal and fall 
asleep.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 225 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 22 June 1871 
Dear Liebknecht, 
Herewith the translation of Section I of the Address.3 The rest 
will follow so quickly that you can print Section I in two successive 
issues, i.e. you will have more copy in 8 days. On condition 
1. that you print quickly and a lot in each issue; 
2. that there are no marginal notes; I have translated so as to 
make them superfluous, apart from innuendos and details which 
could not in any case be explained in a few words; 
3. that the type is left standing for separate publication as a 
pamphlet, which on this occasion is extremely necessary. If you do 
not have the money or credit for this, let us know. 
Anything you cannot print you should replace with dots and 
send the relevant part of the manuscript to Becker in Geneva for 
him to publish it in the Vorbote (mark it clearly so that he can see 
where such passages fit  in). 226 
You will have already received the copy of the original Address 
which I sent you as a letter with a few lines.45 More of these are 
available. 
The Address has caused a tremendous hullaballoo here in 
London. First they tried to ignore it, but it was not possible. On 
Wednesday the 14th, The Evening Standard published a denuncia­
tion, on the 15th The Daily News had an excerpt that then went 
through most other papers. Then The Echo, Spectator on Saturday, 
Graphic, Pall Mall Gazette, Telegraph—with leading articles, and 
that was it. On Monday The Times followed with a really lousy 
LEADER, then the Standard once more, yesterday The Times again, 
and the whole of London spoke only of  us. 227 All wailing, of 
course. Tant mieux. h 
I simply do not understand your scruples about deportation.228 
In your place I would not give up Hessian citizenship without 
having a substitute safely in my pocket. You are too timid on this 
issue. A single great public scandal, which would make it clear to 
the whole world what a humbug all these imperial laws really are, 
would put an end to all this nonsense. But if you avoid the scandal

which can only redound to the detriment of servile nationalists, 
instead of provoking it, then the police will obviously do what they 
like. N.B. all this refers only to the relevant passage in your letter, 
not the stance adopted by the paper3 which is extremely 
courageous, and which we wholeheartedly salute. But do not 
imagine that the police scum would attempt to do to you what 
they venture to do to individual workers; they would only dare try 
it once they had created enough precedents by deporting workers 
over a period of time. 
I did not at all realise that your deportation from Prussia was 
still in force. It may be that the police maintain this. But I was 
never able to comprehend why you did not settle the matter while 
you were still a deputy. 
I am unable to correspond for the Volksstaat, but, as you see, I 
help wherever I can. 
Nothing can be done about The Pall Mall Gazette. I have myself 
had all sorts of conflicts with the paper, even in the case of 
exclusively military articles, and neither you nor I can get political 
things accepted. I only keep the contact going TO KEEP  A FOOTING 
THERE, so as to be able to print things there from time to time. If 
they did accept you as a correspondent, which they will not do, 
none of your reports would be printed. I even went so far in the 
New Year as to tell the editorb I knew full well that I could only 
produce military articles for him and not political ones, and said I 
only did this in the hope that he would publish our factual notices 
dealing with Party affairs when we thought it necessary. And this 
is what has happened. 
You seem to have a very good idea of Reynolds. The greatest 
scoundrel in the press here, an arrant coward whenever he is 
uncertain of success, he has suppressed the entire Address right 
down to the extract from The Daily News. 
The German workers have behaved themselves quite splendidly 
in this last great crisis, better than anyone else. And Bebel has 
been an outstanding spokesman on their  behalf;  his speech on the 
Commune went through the entire English press and made a 
great impression here. You should send the Volksstaat to the 
Pall Mall from time to time; they publish items from it 
occasionally because the man is afraid of Marx and  myself,  and 
because there is another man' there who knows German and 
makes use of such things. Moreover, the paper readily publishes 
all sorts of curious information that others do not include.

ENGELS TO CARLO CAFIERO 231 
IN BARLETTA 
London, l[-3] July 1871 
My dear Friend, 
I hope you received the copy of the Address of the General 
Council on the Civil War in France3 which I sent to the address in 
Florence that you left me. I shall send you another copy at 
Barletta in a couple of days, again in the form of a letter for 
greater safety.b 
I was very pleased to receive your letter from Barletta, which I 
would have answered sooner had the Address not made a great 
deal of work for us. It was violently attacked by the press and we 
had to reply to different newspapers.—  I am also busy translating 
it into German for our Leipzig newspaper (Der Volksstaat). 226 A 
Dutch translation is being published in the Toekomst (The Future) 
of The Hague. If you can arrange for an Italian translation to be 
published this will be of great material help in your propaganda, 
giving the Italian workers a ready means of knowing the opinions 
of the General Council, and the principles and methods of action 
of our Association. 
On further consideration I think it would be opportune to send 
two copies of our Address to Castellazzo in Florence, asking him to 
a K. Marx, The Civil War in France. - b See this volume, pp.  170-71.

send one of them to you in a letter.—This will give me the 
opportunity of establishing a correspondence with him,232 which 
will be regularly maintained. You must excuse me for not writing 
to him sooner, but I have to correspond with Spain and Belgium, 
as well as with Italy. Now, as regards Naples and Caporusso, the 
latter attended one of our Congresses3  although he never kept a 
regular correspondence with the Council. To explain this I need 
to go into certain historical details.—Caporusso and his friends 
were followers of the Russian Bakunin. Bakunin has a theory 
peculiar to  himself,  which is really a mixture of communism and 
Proudhonism; the fact that he wants to unite these two theories in 
one shows that he understands absolutely nothing about political 
economy. Among other phrases he has borrowed from Proudhon 
is the one about anarchy being the final state of society; he is 
nevertheless opposed to all political action by the working classes, 
on the grounds that it would be a recognition of the political state 
of things; also all political acts are in his opinion 'authoritarian'. 
Just how he hopes that the present political oppression and the 
tyranny of capital will be broken, and how he intends to carry out 
his favourite idea on the abolition of inheritance without 'acts of 
authority', he does not explain.—But when in September 1870 the 
insurrection in Lyons was put down by force he decreed in the 
Hôtel de Ville b the abolition of the state, without taking any 
measures against all the bourgeois of the National Guard, who 
calmly walked into the Hôtel de Ville, kicked Bakunin out and put 
the state back on its feet, all in less than an hour. 128 However, 
Bakunin has founded a sect upon his theories, to which a small 
portion of French and Swiss workers belong, many of our 
members in Spain and some in Italy, among whom are Caporusso 
and his friends. Thus Caporusso is true to his name: he has a 
Russian for a boss.c 
Now our Association has been founded to provide a central 
means of communication and joint activity for the working men's 
societies existing in different countries and aiming at the same 
end, viz., the protection, advancement and complete emancipation 
of the working classes (1st Rule of the Association)/ Since the 
particular theories of Bakunin and his friends come under this 
rule,  there can be no objection to accepting them as members and 
allowing them to do what they can to propagate their ideas by 
a the Basle Congress of 1869 - b town hall - c A pun: in Italian 'capo' means 'boss' 
and 'russo'—Russian. - d Rules of  the International Working Men's Association, London,

every appropriate means. We have people of all sorts in our 
Association—communists, Proudhonists, unionists, commercial-
unionists, cooperators, Bakuninists, etc.—and even in our General 
Council we have men of widely differing opinions. 
The moment the Association were to become a sect it would be 
finished. Our power lies in the liberality with which the first rule is 
interpreted, namely that all men who are admitted aim for the 
complete emancipation of the working classes. Unfortunately the 
Bakuninists, with the narrowness of mentality common to all sects, 
were not satisfied with this. In their view the General Council 
consisted of reactionaries, the programme of the Association was 
too vague. Atheism and materialism (which Bakunin himself learnt 
from us Germans) had to become compulsory, the abolition of 
inheritance and the state, etc., had to be part of our programme.— 
Now Marx and I are almost as old and as good atheists and 
materialists as Bakunin, just like almost all our members. We know 
as well as he does that inheritance is nonsensical, although we differ 
from him over the importance and appropriateness of presenting 
its abolition as the deliverance from all evil; and the 'abolition of 
the state' is an old German philosophical phrase, of which we 
made much use when we were tender youths. But to put all these 
things into our programme would mean alienating an enormous 
number of our members, and dividing rather than uniting the 
European proletariat.—When the efforts to get the Bakuninist 
programme adopted as the programme of the Association failed, 
an attempt was made to make the Association take a roundabout 
route. Bakunin formed in Geneva an 'Alliance of Socialist 
Democracy', which was to be an international association separate 
from ours.10—The 'most radical minds in our sections', the 
Bakuninists, were to form sections of this Alliance everywhere, 
and these sections were to be subject to a separate General Council 
in Geneva (Bakunin) and to have national councils separate from 
ours;  and at our General Congress this Alliance was to attend our 
congress in the morning and hold its own separate congress in the 
afternoon.—This delightful plan was put before the General Coun­
cil in November 1868, but on 22 December 1868 the General Coun­
cil annulled these rules as being contrary to the Rules of our 
Association and declared that the sections of the Alliance could 
only be admitted separately and that the Alliance must either be 
disbanded or cease to belong to the International.3 On 9 March 
1869,  the General Council informed the Alliance that 'there exists, 
a K. Marx, The International Working Men's Association and the International Alliance of 
Socialist Democracy.

therefore, no obstacle to the transformation of the sections of the 
Alliance into sections of the Int. W. Ass. The dissolution of the 
Alliance, and the entrance of its sections into the Int. W.  Ass.,  once 
settled, it would, according to our Regulations, become necessary 
to inform the General Council of the residence and the numerical 
strength of each new section.' 3 These conditions were never 
fulfilled exactly, but the Alliance as such disapproved of them 
everywhere except in France and Switzerland where it ended up 
creating a split. About 1,000 Bakuninists—less than a tenth of our 
members—withdrew from the French and Swiss federations 
and have now appealed to the Council to be recognised as a 
separate federation, which very probably the Council will not 
oppose. From this you can see that the main result of the 
Bakuninists' action has been to create splits in our ranks.—Nobody 
opposed their particular dogma, but they were not satisfied with 
that and wanted to be in command and impose their doctrines on 
all our members.—We have resisted, as was our duty, and if they 
will agree to work peaceably alongside our other members we have 
neither the right nor the will to exclude them. But one ought to 
consider whether the presence of these elements should be made 
apparent, and if we can win the Italian sections that are not 
steeped in this particular fanaticism we shall certainly be able to 
work better together. You will be able to judge for yourself on the 
basis of the situation you will have found in Naples. The 
programme quoted in Jules Favre's circular against us as the 
programme of the International, is a genuinely Bakuninist 
programme mentioned above.233  You will find our reply to Favre 
in the London Times of 13 June. b 
Mazzini in 1864 tried to transform our Association to suit his 
own ends, but he failed. His chief instrument was a Garibaldian 
Major Wolff (his real name was Prince Thurn und Taxis) who has 
now been exposed by Tibaldi as a French police spy. 234 When 
Mazzini saw that the International could not serve him as a means, 
he attacked it with great violence and availed himself of every 
opportunity to slander it, but as you say time has passed quickly 
and 'God and the people' is no longer the slogan of the Italian 
working class. 
a The quotation, which is in French in the copy, was distorted by the police translator. 
Here it is given according to the original source (see K. Marx, The General Council of 
the International Working Men's Association to the Central Bureau of the International 
Alliance of Socialist Democracy). - b  K. Marx and F. Engels, 'Statement by the General

We are well aware that the system of tenant farmers or 
'métayère* has been the basis of agricultural production in Italy 
since Roman times. There is no doubt that this system generally 
gives tenant farmers a greater degree of political independence in 
relation to the proletariat than is permitted to tenant farmers 
here.—  But if we accept what Sismondi and recent writers on the 
subject say, the rate of exploitation of tenants by landowners is as 
great in Italy as everywhere else and the lowest stratum of 
peasants are extremely severely burdened. In Lombardy, where 
the plots are extensive, the tenant farmers when I was there 235 
were moderately  well-off,  but there still existed a class of rural 
proletarians employed by the tenants, who practically did all the 
work and derived no benefit from this system. In the other parts of 
Italy where there are fewer tenants, the sharecropping system, so far 
as I can tell from a distance, does not protect them from the same 
poverty, ignorance and degradation which is the fate of small tenant 
farmers in France, Germany, Belgium and Ireland.—Our policy 
towards agricultural populations has been generally and naturally as 
follows: where there are extensive landholdings, the tenant farmer is 
a capitalist in relation to the worker, and there we must support the 
worker; where there are smallholdings, the tenant although 
nominally a small capitalist or landowner (as in France and part of 
Germany) is however in reality generally reduced to the same level of 
poverty as the proletarian, and we must therefore work for 
him.—Without doubt it must be the same in Italy. But the Council 
will be most obliged if you can give us information about these 
matters and also about the recent legislation in Italy concerning rural 
properties and other social questions. 
After numerous interruptions I am finishing this letter on 
3 July, and I ask you only to be so good as to reply promptly. I 
shall write today to Castelazzo.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT

[London,] 10 July 1871 
Dear Liebknecht, 
Herewith the rest of Section III." Section IV will follow in 
2-3 days, and at all events by the end of the week.226 The proofs 
today or tomorrow. 
Ad vocemb deportation,228 the examples you give of deportations 
from Prussia and Mainz will not hold water, because they took 
place in wartime and so were legal. You ought by some means or 
other to force a decision on the cases in Saxony: either by the 
refusal of those involved to leave, or by appeal and petition to the 
Reichstag. The Party of Progress cannot refuse you support on this 
matter without ruining itself totally.236 As long as the Reichstag 
does not explicitly refuse to recognise the rights of citizenship 
and the freedom to live and move where one likes, the issue is not 
settled. As to your particular case, you could have brought it to 
the boil very quickly by going to Berlin 8 days before the opening 
of the Reichstag and waiting to see what happened. I am 
convinced that they would not have touched you, and that would 
have been the end of it. If they had made a move against you, 
there would have been a fearful outcry and they would have had 
to release you as soon as the Reichstag convened; you would then 
have been able to expose the Reichstag in the eyes of the entire 
world if they had not behaved properly. There are certain 
decencies that even the most wretched assembly cannot openly 
violate in untroubled times. However, now that you are no longer 
in the Reichstag, it is no longer so simple. But if you allow all 
these rights that you possess on paper to be taken from you in 
reality without any sort of struggle, and if you do not force the 
Reichstag to decide publicly for or against its own creation, then 
there is no helping you. 
The imperious tone in which you demanded that we should 
found a paper here amused us hugely. You must have confused 
London with Crimmitschau to have imagined that one can just go

ahead and establish a Bürger- und Bauernfreund here without more 
ado. 237 You surely ought still to be aware that just as London is 
larger than Crimmitschau so too the difficulties in setting up a 
paper and all the demands made of it are correspondingly greater. 
If you can put some £10,000 at our disposal, we shall be at your 
service. 
Ad vocem Odger, you forget that the man was elected by the 
Congress and could not be expelled without a valid reason.238 From 
what you say on this point it is quite clear that you have 
completely lost touch with the situation here, which is not 
surprising since the papers maintain a total silence about events 
within the workers' party. 
We have now thoroughly and definitively broken off relations 
with The Pall Mall Gazette.

London, 16 July 1871 
My dear Friend, 
I hope you have received my letter of 3 Julyb which I sent to 
Barletta. I got yours of 28 June the day after sending mine, and I 
was pleased to hear that you have received the Address,0 which is 
currently being translated into Italian and will be published in that 
language. As for the Russian translation, urge the lady by every 
possible means to finish it, because the sooner it is done and 
published the better.244 Besides, the German, Dutch and Spanish 
translations are being published in Madrid, the French translation 
will be published in Geneva and perhaps another in Brussels.245 
Thus despite all the persecutions of the continental Government it 
is satisfying to recognise that our Association has greater means of 
international publishing than the semi-official press of any 
European Government. 
When your letter arrived mine to Florence had not yet been 
sent,d and considering the position I thought it better not to write 
directly there. A letter containing printed documents sent from 
London to a shoemaker in Florence, whose name had appeared in 
the Address to the Commune,246 would naturally arouse suspicion,

Perhaps you will be so good as to send certain of these

your own use. I do not know exactly which documents our

of some or all of these kindly let me know and they will be sent to 
you as soon as we have them. In any case, you now have enough 
material to communicate whatever information about the present 
state of our Association may be requested by our friends in 
Florence. It will perhaps be a good idea if, for the moment, I do 
not correspond with them except through you, until the present 
persecutions are over, because it would not be advantageous to 
compromise anyone more than is necessary. Meanwhile, and until 
their society is reconstituted, they could form a section of our 
Association right away among their closest friends, from six to a 
dozen, and write us a letter stating that they are affiliating and 
nominating their secretary, with whom I shall then enter into 
correspondence. This section could at a later date be merged into 
the reconstituted society. As soon as the letter arrives the list of 
names will be transcribed and sent for publication. 
We are pleased to hear that you and other friends do not fear 
the persecutions but welcome them as the best means of 
propaganda. This is my opinion and it seems we are destined to 
have an abundance of such persecutions. In Spain many people 
have been imprisoned and others are in hiding. In Belgium the 
government is trying with all its might to give free rein to the law 
and even more against us. In Germany the followers of Bismarck 
are starting to play this game too, except that there more than in 
Spain they are impeded by the forceful resistance of our men who 
have been much more fortunate. No doubt you will still have your 
share in Italy, but we are satisfied that these persecutions will be 
met in a different spirit from that of Caporusso and his friends.247

It is truly remarkable that these partisans of Bakunin should 
display such cowardice as soon as there is the slightest sign of 
danger. The Spanish Bakuninists, who recently wrote to tell us 
that their practice of abstention from political affairs had been a 
huge success, so much so that the socialists were no longer feared, 
but considered completely innocent people (!!), have not behaved 
at all well in the face of the recent persecutions, and we are not 
able to find a single one of them from any nation who has at any 
time allowed himself of his own will to be exposed to danger 
either on a barricade or elsewhere.— It will be good for us to get 
rid of them altogether, and if you can find people in Naples or in 
some other town who are not connected to this current in Geneva 
it will be so much the better.—Whatever we manage to do or 
whatever congress we prescribe these men will always form, in 
reality if not in name, an internal sect in our society, and the men 
of Naples, Spain,etc., will give more weight to our communications 
received through their own headquarters than to anything else our 
Association can do. Thus if they come back into our Association we 
think it will be for a short time only and once again the disputes 
will arise that will lead to their exclusion. We have had proofs of 
the fact that they still intend to form their own International 
within the Great International and they can rest assured that 
neither the General Council nor the Congress will warrant any 
violation of our Rules. 
What you say about the state of the population in the south of 
Italy does not surprise us. Even here in England, where the 
movement of the working classes is almost as old as this century, 
one meets with apathy and ignorance in abundance. The 
trade-union movement has become more an obstacle to the 
general movement than an instrument of its progress, and outside 
the trade unions there exists here a huge mass of workers in 
London who for several years have kept quite apart from the 
political movement and are consequently very ignorant. But on the 
other hand they are also exempt from many of the traditional 
prejudices of trade-unionists and other old sects and thus 
constitute excellent material upon which to work. They are about 
to be mobilised by our Association, and we have recognised that 
they are intelligent. 
I can understand perfectly your position in Naples. It is the 
same position as some of us were in 25 years ago in Germany, 
when we first founded the social movement. At that time we had 
among the proletarians the only few men in Switzerland, France 
and England who had absorbed socialist and communist ideas; we

had very few means with which to work on the masses and, like 
you, we had to find supporters among the schoolmasters, 
journalists and students. Luckily in this period of the movement 
such men, not belonging exactly to the working class, were easy to 
find. Later, when the working people as a mass are in command 
of the movement, they certainly become rarer. 
With the freedom granted by 1848, with the press and with the 
register of meetings and associations, this first phase of the 
movement was naturally much curtailed, and no doubt in a year 
or two you will be able to give us a different report of the state of 
affairs in Naples. 
We thank you also for your resolution to tell us the facts as they 
really are. Our Association is strong enough to show itself willing 
to know the real truth, even when it seems unfavourable, and 
nothing can weaken it more than exaggerated reports without a 
real foundation. Act in this way and you will never receive from 
me any report which might in the slightest way make you see 
things differently from the way they are. 
I enclose the report of the meeting of the Council on 4 Julya 
with all the facts relating to Major  Wolff. 234 Since the man is well 
known in Italy it will be a good thing to publish them there. 
May I add that we have a rule for all periodical newspapers 
published by our organisation: two copies must be sent regularly 
to the Council here, one for the archive where they are all kept, 
one for the secretary of the country where they are published. 
Would you trouble yourself to see to this as soon as there is an 
Italian organ of the Association? In the case of Italian translations, 
too, a number of copies should be sent here. 
We now have Italian refugees here who fought in Paris for the 
Commune and are being helped by our refugee fund. 
Fraternal greetings.

Excuse me for answering with such a delay.3 I have been so

As to our mutual friend3 the most alarming news has arrived

If you were able to find me a correspondent in Berlin who might 
serve as an intermediary for some of the commercial business I

for some articles that circuitous way might prove shorter than the

Dear Kugelmann, 
Be so good as to send the enclosed note to Liebknecht at once. 17 
I find your silence very strange. I cannot assume that the 
various packages of printed matter have failed to reach you. 
On the other hand, it would be very foolish if you wanted to 
punish me in this way for not writing—on the old principle of 
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Remember, mon cher,  that if 
the day had 48 hours, I would still not have finished my day's 
work for months now. 
The work for the International is immense, and in addition 
London is overrun with REFUGEES, whom we have to look after.251 
Moreover, I am overrun by other people—newspaper men and 
others of every description—who want to see the 'MONSTER' with 
their own eyes.

Up till now it has been thought that the emergence of the 
Christian myths during the Roman Empire was possible only 
because printing had not yet been invented. Precisely the contrary. 
The daily press and the telegraph, which in a moment spreads its 
inventions over the whole earth, fabricate more myths in one day 
(and the bourgeois cattle believe and propagate them still further), 
than could have previously been produced in a century. 
My daughters have been in the Pyrenees for some months.212

whom I ask you to greet cordially—are well. 
Apropos. You were probably astonished to see that I made 
references to a duel in my missive to the Pall Mall.b The matter 
was quite simple. Had I not given the EDITOR this excuse for 
making a few cheap jokes, he would simply have suppressed the

[Draft] 
[London,] 27 July 1871 
Dear Citizen, 
Last Tuesday" the General Council resolved that there would 
not be a Congress this year (in view of extraordinary cir­
cumstances) but that, as in 1865, there should be a private 
Conference in London254  to which different sections would be 
invited to send their delegates. The convocation of this Confer­
ence must not be published in the  press.  Its meetings will not be public 
ones.  The Conference will be required to concern  itself,  not with 
theoretical questions, but exclusively with questions of organisation. 
It will also deal with disputes between the different sections of a 
particular country. The Conference will open in London on 17 
September (third Sunday in September). Jung will advise Becker 
and Perret of these resolutions.

At last Tuesday's meeting two questions were put to the General 
Council by Guillaume 255: 1) He sent copies of two letters, one, 
dated 28 July 1869, from Eccarius, whereby the Alliance was 
recognised as a section of the International, the other, dated 
25 August 1869, from Jung. This was a receipt for the Alliance's 
contribution (year 1868-69). Now Guillaume is asking if these 
letters were authentic. 
We replied saying that there could be no doubt on that score. 
2nd question: 'Has the General Council passed a resolution 
excluding the Alliance from the International?' We replied, saying, 
as was the case, that there had been no resolution of this kind 
Up till then, there had been nothing but facts to ascertain, but 
when Robin, on behalf of his mandatories, sought to interpret 
these facts in a light that would have prejudged the Swiss 
dispute,9 the Council cut things short! 
First it was pointed out that, in a letter preceding the one from 
Eccarius, the conditions of the Alliance's admission had been 
specified, that they had been accepted by the Alliance and that it 
was a question of knowing whether the Alliance had fulfilled those 
conditions—a question to be dealt with by the Conference. 
As to the contribution for 1868-69, it was pointed out that this 
payment was made by the Alliance to buy its admission to the 
Basle Congress of 1869 and that thereafter the Alliance had paid 
nothing further. 
As to the second question, it was pointed out that if the General 
Council had not passed a resolution excluding the Alliance, this 
certainly was no proof that the Alliance had not excluded itself by 
its own conduct and actions. 
The Council then resolved that, while it might reply to the 
factual questions raised by Guillaume, it reserved for the 
Conference the right to pronounce on the essential aspects of the 
affair. 
L'Egalité arrives here at very irregular intervals. 
You would oblige me by acknowledging receipt of this letter. 
Fraternal greetings, 
K. M. 
P. S. I do not sign myself Secretary for Russia in the Council's 
manifestoes for fear of compromising our friends in Russia.

ENGELS TO CARLO CAFIERO 231 
IN NAPLES 
London, 28 July 1871 
122, R.P.R. N.W. 
Dear Cafiero, 
I have received your letter of the 12th, and I hope you have 
received the one I sent to Naples a few days before," containing 
the Rules of the Association, the deliberations of the Geneva and 
Brussels congresses, the secondb edition of the address on the civil 
war in France, the addresses on the Franco-Prussian war, the 
Association's Inaugural Address of 1864, etc., etc. These docu­
ments will certainly suffice to explain to you what the rules and 
principles of our society are and the means which the General 
Council has available to act in the name and on behalf of the 
society. I have once again received the Plebe of Lodi, the bulletin 
on Caporusso and the issue of Roma del Popolo containing 
Mazzini's attack on us.c 
As for the facts relating to Caporusso which have been 
published and subsequently quoted in your letter, they would 
seem to be sufficient to make him incapable of harming us in the 
future. If he were to dare to present himself again to the public as 
a representative of the working class, the story of the 300 lire256 
would be made public and that would erase the last traces of his 
influence. We are pleased to hear that there is no sign of the 
Bakuninist sect over there. We had been led to believe the reverse 
because the Swiss Bakuninists always asserted it to be the  case.  They 
repeated it constantly and since we received no reply from Naples 
to our letters we believed it. We had no address in Naples other 
than that of Caporusso, to whom at least 3 letters were written by 
our French secretary E. Dupont in Marx's presence, but Caporus­
so must have suppressed them. If you think it is worth the trouble, 
ask Caporusso about those letters. Besides, no replies from Naples 
were ever received, and if those letters which were sent were 
addressed, as you say, directly to the Council, it is only too evident 
that, between them, the Italian, French and British police would 
have prevented them from arriving.

You are right to dwell on the moment of reflexion (in which I 
recognise with pleasure the very voice of old Hegel, to whom we 
are all so indebted)3  and to say that the Association cannot be 
satisfied in its work with the mere assertion of Article 1 of the 
Rules,  a principle which, unless developed, will remain a mere 
negation, the negation of the right of the aristocratic and bourgeois 
classes to 'exploit' the proletariat. In fact we must go much 
further, we must develop the positive side of the question, how the 
emancipation of the proletariat is to take effect, and thus the 
discussion of different opinions becomes not just inevitable but 
necessary. As I say, this discussion is going ahead constantly not 
only within the Association but also in the General Council, where 
there are Communists, Proudhonists, Owenists, Chartists, Bakuninists, 
etc., etc. The most difficult thing is to get them all together and 
ensure that the differences of opinion on these matters do not 
disturb the solidity and stability of the Association. In this we have 
always been fortunate, with the sole exception of the Swiss 
Bakuninists, who with true sectarian fury always dared to impose 
their programme on the Association, both by direct means and 
indirectly, by forming a special international society with its own 
General Council, its own congress, and all this within the great 
International  itself.  When this was attempted in the form of the 
Alliance de la démocratie socialiste de Genève ° the Council replied as 
follows (22 December 1868) b: 
'According to these documents (the Programme and Regulations 
of the Alliancec), the said Alliance is merged entirely in the 
International, at the same time as it is established entirely outside 
this Association. Besides the General Council of the International, 
elected at the Geneva, Lausanne and Brussels congresses, there is to 
be, in line with the initiatory rules (of the Alliance), another Central 
Council in Geneva, which is self-appointed. Besides the local groups 
of the International, there are to be the local groups of the Alliance, 
which through their national bureaus, operating outside the national 
bureaus of the International, shall ask the Central Bureau of  the Alliance 
to admit them into the International. The Alliance Central Committee 
thereby takes upon itself the right of admittance to the International.

the inner form of the historical self-consciousness and self-development of 
culture. - b K. Marx, 'The International Working Men's Association and the 
International Alliance of Socialist Democracy'. - c  The words in parentheses were

182 109. Engels to Cafiero. 28 July 1871 
Lastly, the General Congress of the International Working Men's 
Association will have its parallel (doublure) in the General Congress 
of the Alliance, for, as the initiatory rules say, 
'"At the Annual Working Men's Congress the delegation of the Alliance of 
Socialist Democracy, as a branch of the International Working Men's Association, shall 
hold public meetings in a separate building." 
'Considering: 
'That the presence of a second international body operating 
within and outside the International Working Men's Association 
would be the infallible means of its disorganisation; 
'That every other group of individuals, residing anywhere at all, 
would have the right to imitate the Geneva initiatory group (of the 
Alliance) and, under more or less plausible excuses, to bring into the 
International Working Men's Association other international associa­
tions with special missions; 
'That the International Working Men's Association would 
thereby soon become a plaything for intriguers of any nationality 
and any party; 
'That, moreover, the Rules of the International Working Men's 
Association admit only local and national branches into its ranks 
(see Art. 1 and Art. 6 of the Rules); 
'That sections of the International Working Men's Association 
are forbidden to adopt rules or administrative regulations contrary 
to the General Rules and Administrative Regulations of the 
International Working Men's Association (see Art. 12 of the 
Administrative Regulations); 
'That the matter has been prejudged by the resolutions against 
the Ligue de la Paix, adopted unanimously at the Brussels 
Congress. (This league had invited the International to join it, and 
this was our answer to these bourgeois) 257; 
'That in these resolutions, the Congress declares that the Ligue 
de la Paix had no raison d'être, because after its recent declarations 
its aim and its principles were identical with those of the 
International Working Men's Association; that numerous members 
of the initiatory group of the Alliance, in their capacity as 
delegates to the Brussels Congress, voted for these resolutions; 
'the General Council of the International Working Men's 
Association unanimously agreed: 
'1) All articles of the Rules of the International Alliance 
of Socialist Democracy defining its relations with the 
International Working Men's Association are declared null and 
void; 
'2) the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy may not 

=====第217页=====
109. Engels to Cafiero. 28 July 1871 183 
be admitted as a branch of the International Working Men's 
Association.' 
I do not think there can be any disagreement on this point, 
namely that the International cannot permit another, sectarian 
International to exist within its own organisation. There is not the 
slightest doubt that all future Congresses and General Councils 
will energetically oppose the organisation of such intrigues within 
our own ranks and it would be good if our friends in Naples, at 
least those of them that have links with Geneva, understood this: 
The Bakuninists are a tiny minority within the Association and 
they are the only ones who have at all times brought about 
dissension. I am referring mainly to the Swiss, because we had little 
or nothing to do with the others. We have always allowed them to 
have their principles and to promote them as they thought best, so 
long as they renounced all attempts at undermining the Associa­
tion or imposing their programme on us. In this way they will see 
that the workers of Europe will not be made the playthings of a 
little sect. As for their theoretical views, the General Council wrote 
to the Alliance on 9 March 1869a citing Article 1 of the Rules: 
'Since the sections of the working class in different countries 
find themselves in different conditions of development, it neces­
sarily follows that their theoretical notions, which reflect the real 
movement, should also diverge. The community of action, however, 
called into life by the International Working Men's Association, the 
exchange of ideas facilitated by the public organs of the different 
national sections, and the direct debates at the General Congresses, 
are sure by and by to engender a common theoretical programme. 
Consequently, it belongs not to the functions of the General Council 
to subject the programme of the Alliance to a critical examination. It 
is not our task to find out whether it is or is not an adequate 
expression of the proletarian movement. All we have to know is 
whether its general tendency does not run against the general 
tendency of our Association, viz., the complete emancipation of the 
working class.' 
I have given you these extensive quotations in order to prove 
the unfoundedness of any accusation that the General Council 
would be overstepping the limits of Article 1 of the Rules. In its 
official powers regarding the admission or refusal of divisions, it 
certainly cannot act in this way. But as regards discussions of 
a K. Marx, 'The General Council of the International Working Men's 
Association to the Central Bureau of the International Alliance of Socialist 
Democracy'. 

=====第218页=====
184 109. Engels to Cafiero, 28 July 1871 
theoretical points, the Council desires nothing more ardently than 
this. From discussions of this sort the Council hopes to arrive at a 
general theoretical programme acceptable to the European pro­
letariat. At all our theoretical congresses, the discussions have 
taken up by far the largest part of the time, but it should be noted 
that in these discussions Bakunin and his friends have played a 
very small role. In its official papers too the General Council has 
gone much further than Article 1. Read all the addresses that 
have been sent to you,a and in particular number 5, the one on 
the civil war in France, where we declare ourselves in favour of 
communism, a fact which will no doubt have displeased the many 
Proudhonists in the Assembly. We were able to do this because we 
were led to it by the capitalist slanderers of the Paris Commune. 
No document has been issued by the General Council which 
does not go beyond Article 1. But the Council can go beyond the 
official programme of the Association only insofar as circumstances 
are able to justify it. It cannot give any section the right to say: 
you have broken our statutes; you are officially proclaiming things 
which are not in the Rules of the Association. You say that our 
friends in Naples are not content with mere abstraction, that they 
want something concrete, that they are not satisfied with anything 
except equality, social order instead of disorder. Good; we are 
willing to go further. There is not a single man in the General 
Council who does not support the total abolition of social classes 
and there is not a single document of the General Council which is 
not in accordance with this aim. We must free ourselves from 
landowners and capitalists, and for this end promote the 
development of the associated classes of agricultural and industrial 
workers and all the means of production, land, tools, machines, 
raw materials and whatever means exist to support life during the 
time necessary for production. In this way inequality must cease. 
And to bring this about we need the political supremacy of the 
proletariat. I think that is concrete enough for our friends in 
Naples. At the same time, since others are performing our role in 
working the bad soil, the General Council cannot be expected to 
send out incendiary statements at every other moment, statements 
which would please a good many of our members while certainly 
displeasing the rest. If however a real conjuncture arises, then we 
show our strength, as in the case of the address on the civil war in 
France. As for the religious question, we cannot speak about it 
officially, except when the priests provoke us, but you will detect 
a See this volume, p. 170. 

=====第219页=====

the spirit of atheism in all our publications. Moreover, we do not 
admit any society which has the slightest hint of religious allusion 
in its statutes. Many wanted to apply, but they were all invariably 
rejected. If our friends in Naples were to form a society of atheists 
and admitted only atheists, whatever would happen to their 
propaganda in a city where, as you yourself say, it is not only God 
that is omnipotent but also St Januarius, who needs to be handled 
with kid gloves. 
I am enclosing a letter for C. Palladino45 containing expressions 
of solidarity with the Naples Section, as you requested. Please pass 
it on to him. 
Now for Mazzini. I communicated his article in Roma del Popolo 
to the Council last Tuesday.a I shall send you the report published 
on the discussion in a few days.258 For Italy, however, it is 
desirable that the following be published259: 
'Mazzini says: 
"This Association, founded in London some years ago and with which I 
refused to  collaborate  from the start ... a nucleus of individuals which takes it upon 
itself directly to govern a broad multitude of men of different nations, tendencies, 
political conditions, economic interests and methods of action will always end up by 
not functioning, or it will have to function tyrannically. For this reason I withdrew 
and shortly afterwards the Italian workers' section withdrew."' 
Now for the facts. After the foundation meeting of our 
association on 28 September 1864, as soon as the Provisional 
Council was elected in public assembly, Major L. Wolff presented a 
manifesto and a number of rules drawn up by Mazzini  himself. 
Not only was there no objection in these drafts to governing a 
multitude directly, etc., not only did he not say that this effort 'if it 
is to work at all, will have to function tyrannically', but on the 
contrary, the rules were conceived in the spirit of a centralised 
conspiracy, giving tyrannical powers to the central body. The 
manifesto was in Mazzini's usual style: la démocratie vulgaire, 
offering the workers political rights in order to preserve intact the 
social privileges of the middle and upper classes. This manifesto 
and draft statutes were subsequently thrown out. But the Italians 
(their names are listed at the end of our Inaugural Address) 
remained members until the said question was reopened with 
respect to certain French bourgeois democrats who wanted to 
manipulate the International. When they were refused admission, 
first Wolff b and then the others withdrew and we finished once 
and for all with Mazzini.260 Some time afterwards, the Central

Council, replying to an article by Vésinier, stated in the Liège 
newspaper that Mazzini had never been a member of the 
Association and the drafts of his manifesto and statutes had been 
rejected. 261 You will have seen that Mazzini has made a frenzied 
attack on the Paris Commune in the British press too, which is just 
what he always does when the proletarians rise up; after their 
defeat he denounces them to the  bourgeoisie.  After the insurrection 
of June 1848 he did the same thing, denouncing the insurgent 
proletarians in such offensive terms that even Louis Blanc wrote a 
pamphlet against him. And Louis Blanc has since told us several 
times that the June insurrection was the work of Bonapartist 
agents.262 
If Mazzini calls our friend Marx a 'man of  corrosive  ... intellect, of 
domineering temper', etc., etc., I can only say that Marx's corrosive-
domination and his jealous nature have kept our Association 
together for seven years, and that he has done more than anyone 
else to bring it to its present proud position. As for the break up 
of the Association, which is said to have begun already here in 
England, the fact is that two English members of the Council,3 who 
had been getting on too close terms with the bourgeoisie, found 
our address on the civil war too strong and they withdrew.238 In 
their place we have four new English membersb and one 
Irishman,c and we reckon ourselves to be much stronger here in 
England than we were before the two renegades left. Instead of 
being in a state of dissolution, we are now for the first time being 
publicly recognised by the entire English press as a great European 
power, and never has a greater sensation been caused by a little 
pamphlet than that produced here in London by the address on 
the civil war, the third edition of which is about to appear. 
I repeat that it is highly desirable that this reply to Mazzini 
should be published in Italian and that the Italian workers are 
shown that the great agitator and conspirator Mazzini has no other 
advice for them than this: educate yourselves, teach yourselves as 
best you can (as if this were just up to them), strive to create more 
consumer cooperatives (not just producer ones) and trust in the 
future!! 
At last Tuesday's01 MEETING the Council resolved that a private 
conference of delegates from the various nations of workers of the 
International Association should be held on the third Sunday in 
September (17 September).

This resolution was passed because a public congress is now 
impossible, in view of the government persecutions now taking 
place in Spain, France, Germany and perhaps also in Italy. If we 
held a public congress, in the majority of these countries our 
delegates would not be publicly elected and they would probably 
be arrested on their return. Given this state of affairs we are 
compelled to resort to a private conference, of which neither the 
convocation, the meeting time nor the proceedings will be made 
public. A conference of this type took place in 1865 instead of a 
congress.254 This conference can naturally meet only in London, 
since this is the only capital in Europe where foreigners are not 
condemned to expulsion by the police. The number of delegates 
and the norms for elections are left entirely to the various national 
divisions. The conference will only have a few days at its disposal 
and it will thus limit its discussions mainly to practical questions 
concerning the internal Administration of the general organisation 
of the society. Since its sessions will not be public, and the 
discussions will not subsequently be published, the discussion of 
theoretical points will be of little importance; nevertheless the 
delegates' meeting will be a propitious occasion for an exchange of 
ideas.  The General Council will place before the conference a 
report on its work over the last two years and the conference will 
pronounce upon it. There will thus be several important questions 
to deal with before proceeding. 
I beg you however to press for the reorganisation of our 
sections in Italy as far as possible so that they can be represented 
in this conference. Since Gambuzzi will be coming to London at 
about this time, he could perhaps rearrange his trip to suit and 
receive a mandate as one of your delegates. I must however draw 
your attention at the same time to paragraph 8 of the Administra­
tive Regulations, which says: 
'Only those delegates of divisions and sections that have paid 
their contributions to the General Council can take part in the 
work of the Congress.'263 
The contribution is one soldo or 10 cents a year for each 
member; it would be a good idea to send it in advance of the 
conference, otherwise difficulties may arise regarding the powers 
of delegates. 
I would be grateful if you could send me at least six copies of 
the Italian translation of The Civil War in France as soon as it is 
published, for the use of the Council. 
It would be advisable if, in addressing your letter, instead of my 
name you used that of Miss Burns, as follows: Miss Burns, 122

ENGELS TO THE MOTHER SUPERIOR 
OF THE CONVENT OF THE SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE 
IN HAMPSTEAD 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] 
[London, early August 1871] 
Madam, 
I am taking the liberty of writing to you, following a 
conversation I had yesterday with one of the sisters from your 
establishment. 
My concern is to find places as boarders for three little girls, 
Eugénie Dupont (aged 9), Marie D. (aged 7) and Clarisse D. 
(aged 3). Their father works as foreman in Mr Joseph Higham's 
musical instrument factory in Manchester; their mother died some 
eighteen months ago and Mr Dupont, feeling he cannot bring up 
his children at home in a satisfactory manner, has requested me to 
find suitable places for them. 
The lady who received me yesterday informed me that you 
would have room for the little girls and that the fee for boarding 
them would be £13 a child for the first year and £12 for 
subsequent years; she then suggested I communicate to you in 
writing what I require. 
I would therefore beg you, Madam, to be so kind as to tell me 
whether you would agree to take them, in which case I should 
instruct their father to come to London without delay in order to 
introduce them to you. If, by any chance, you should need further 
information I would beg you to let me know at what time I should 
call and provide you with it. 
It was Mr Clarkson of Maitland Park who gave me the address 
of your establishment. 
I am, Madam, your most obedient servant, 
F. E.

ENGELS TO PHILIPPE COENEN " 8 
IN ANTWERP 
[London,] 4 August 1871 
Dear Citizen Coenen, 
I duly received your two letters of 1 May and of the 1st inst., 
from which I learn that the cigar-workers of Antwerp have not 
been, and even now are still not, affiliated to the International. I 
cannot but be greatly surprised at your failure to tell us as much 
the moment the strike began,177  since everything we have done for 
them here—no mere trifle, considering the assistance we procured 
for them amounted to 15,000 francs and more—was done in the 
belief that we were working for Internationals"; and now we hear 
that not only were they not of our ilk, but that, after all we have 
done for them, they are still not affiliated! It is really too much 
and, as for  myself,  I am determined to do nothing more 
whatsoever for such ingrates. Is that what these gentry call 
solidarity—taking the money of English working men and others, 
procured for them by the International, and, having pocketed it, 
failing to join our association, thus providing immediate proof that 
they are prepared to do as much for others? That is not how we 
understand the matter here, and it is not for such people that the 
International ought to work. Those who wish to draw on the 
assistance of our Association must also be prepared to carry their 
share of the burden, and the least proof they could give of their 
willingness to do so is to become affiliated. People who scream 
their heads off for the Internationals' money and yet refuse to 
belong to us deserve to be exploited good and proper by the 
bourgeoisie, for they reject the only possible way of escaping 
bourgeois exploitation: the association and organisation of all the 
workers of Europe. No such case has occurred since the 
International came into existence; it is to the Antwerp cigar-
workers that the honour has been reserved of begging for 
assistance from the International and, having obtained that 
assistance, of telling us: Thank you, gentlemen, you may 
withdraw, we have no further use for you, there is the door! 
I hope that I have judged them too harshly and that they have 
a See this volume, p. 125.

affiliated themselves by now, but if they do not do so at once, you 
must, I think, agree that their conduct is disgraceful beyond 
measure, and as long as I have heard no news of their affiliation I 
shall object to the despatch of so much as another centime to 
them. We can put our money to far better use by giving it to 
people who are on our side. 
You ask me if the London cigar-workers are affiliated? But of 
course they are, and have been since the founding of the 
International. Their president, Citizen Cohn, represents them on 
the General Council. I spoke to him about the letter you wish him 
to write to the Antwerp people regarding affiliation, but what 
effect would a letter have where 15,000 francs has had none? 
The Werker continues to arrive very irregularly, and only one 
copy at that. Since there are very few working men here who 
understand Flemish, it would be very difficult to find subscribers; 
however, I have asked the members of the Council to cry up the 
merits of your sheet. 
It will not be possible to hold a Congress this year, it being 
wholly precluded by government persecution in France, Spain, 
Germany, Austria and Hungary. Instead, a private conference will 
be held to consolidate our organisation,265 but this is a subject upon 
which the General Council can correspond only with the various 
central councils. Besides we doubt whether the Dutch government 
would be liberal enough to give full liberty to our Congress at 
which, after the events in Paris, some very delicate questions 
would certainly be raised. 
At the last meeting of the General Councila  the secretariats were 
reallocated; I was given Spain and Italy, and handed over Belgium 
to Citizen Alfred Herman of Liège, who had been recommended 
for the position by the last Belgian Congress. So it will be he who 
will henceforward correspond with you.

These are bookseller's prices and there would be a discount of 
about 15 per cent on the above. However, if you authorise me to 
try and get them for you second-hand, I would probably have to 
pay no more than half the price and my little bookseller would 
gladly attend to the matter. I would have let you have this 
information sooner, but my bookseller has been away on his 
travels. 
You will have received a letter from Williams17 yesterday. We 
have not had more recent news from the indisposed traveller,266 
but we have found the means of conveying a letter by safe hand to 
IleTep6yprbf and hope soon to have the more detailed news for 
which we have insistently been asking. 
As to the Tauchnitz edition of Buckle,8 I know nothing about it 
but I should be very surprised if it does not exist—any German 
bookseller in Paris would, by the way, be able to tell you. 
I am sending you the last two numbers of The Eastern 
Post.367

about that. 
Could you arrange a subscription for me to the Gazette des 
Tribuneaux beginning on 7 August or even 1 August? We need the 
most authentic text of the Versailles trials 268 for our historical 
studies and there is no other journal to my knowledge that would 
give as comprehensive a report. At the same time I don't know 
how to get hold of it over here, and there is no time to lose, for if 
we delay we might miss the most interesting numbers. You would 
greatly oblige us if you could see to this matter; we shall attend to 
your outlays afterwards. 
Another thing. In order to make a study of military events 
during the two sieges of Paris,269 I need a plan of Paris and its 
environs, the best that is to be had, giving if possible also the street 
names in Neuilly and the other minor localities where fighting 
took place. I have tried in vain to obtain one here. Perhaps you 
could give me the title of a detailed map and the publisher's name 
after which I should have no difficulty in procuring it. 
So you see, my dear friend, that you cannot live in Paris with 
impunity and that I shall probably have more commissions for you 
than you will have for me. Meanwhile let me know what to do 
about the English books and rest assured of my cordial respects.

Haverstock Hill, N.W. 
Citizen Koll, 
After I had received £4.1/6 from Lessner for the Pest tailors, I 
read in the German papers that the tailors' strike in Pest was 
271 
over. 
I therefore wrote at once to Jakob Holländer 11 (at the address of 
Johann Travnick, etc., which is the address Holländer himself had 
given to the Workers' Society 3). In my letter [I] informed him that 
I had received £4.1/6 to send to him from the German Workers' 
Society, but that I had read in the German papers that the STRIKE 
was over, and therefore wanted to know— if the news turned out to 
be true—whether the Pest tailors would mind the money being put 
into the fund for the French refugees. I asked him for an 
immediate reply. 
Since no answer came, on 27 June I paid the money into the 
refugee fund (as you can see from the enclosed receipt) in the 
name of the Workers' Society. 
This was done with the reservation that if the Pest workers, acting 
through their correspondent Holländer, should direct me to put the money 
to another use, the £4.1/6 paid by me into the refugee fund in the 
name of the Workers' Educational Society should be regarded as a 
personal contribution from  myself,  and I would then send the 
money on to Pest on behalf of the Workers' Society. 
However, no reply came from Pest and so I regarded the matter 
as settled. 
In consequence of your letter I have now written to Bachruch 17 
(a Hungarian worker in Paris) and asked him to find a safe way to 
write to Jakob Holländer in Pest and request him to reply to my 
letter at once.

MARX TO ADOLPHE HUBERT 1 
IN LONDON 
L J [London,] 10 August 1871 
Dear Citizen, 
I think there has been a misunderstanding. 
In the first place it was not a bookseller, but my friend E. Glaser 
de Willebrord, who expressed his willingness to undertake, at his 
own expense, the publication of the reports in Brussels. 264 
The day before yesterday I received a letter from him in which 
he says: 
'On Sunday I received the enclosed letter' (from Mr Bigot) 'to which I replied, 
pointing out that, owing to the already considerable costs of publication, I could 
not increase them by a daily sum of 100 francs, but that, since personal gain was 
not my object, I was prepared to pay the stenographer and the correspondent out 
of the profits expected to accrue. The absence of a reply indicated that my 
proposal had not been accepted. This caused me much delight, for the Figaro and 
the Gazette des Tribuneaux have arranged to publish full reports of the trial that 
began yesterday in Versailles. In any case my prolonged stay in London would 
have prevented me from making the necessary preparations.' 
Mr Willebrord adds that in future all correspondence should be 
sent direct to him: E. Glaser de Willebrord, 24, Rue de la Pépinière, 
Brussels. 
The public prosecutor at Versailles has made a grotesque 
accusation against the International}1* In the interests of the 
defence it might be useful to acquaint Mr Bigot with the following 
facts: 

=====第230页=====
196 115. Marx to Hubert. 10 August 1871 
1. Enclosed (under No. I) the General Council's two manifestoes 
on the Franco-Prussian War.3 In its first manifesto, of 23 July 
1870,  the General Council declared that the war was being waged, 
not by the French people, but by the Empire and that at bottom 
Bismarck was as culpable as Bonaparte. At the same time the 
General Council appealed to German workers not to permit the 
Prussian government to change a defensive war into a war of 
conquest. 
2. In the second manifesto, of 9 September 1870 (5 days after 
the proclamation of the Republic), there is a most emphatic 
denunciation of the Prussian government's plans for conquest. It is 
an appeal to German and English working men to throw in their 
lot with the French Republic. 
In fact the working men in Germany belonging to the 
International Association opposed Bismarck's policies with such 
vigour that he illegally sequestered the principal German rep­
resentatives of the International and cast them into Prussian 
fortresses on a false charge of 'conspiring' with the enemy.115 
In London, following the appeal by the Council, English 
working men held mass meetings in order to compel their 
government to recognise the French Republic and do all in its 
power to oppose the dismemberment of France.108 
3. Now, is the French government unaware of the support 
given to France by the International during the war? On the 
contrary. Mr Jules Favre's Consul in Vienna—Mr Lefaivre—has 
actually been so indiscreet as to publish—in the name of the 
French government—a letter of thanks to Messrs Liebknecht and 
Bebel, the two representatives of the International in the German 
Reichstag. In this letter he says, inter alia (I am retranslating this 
from a German translation of Lefaivre's letter): 
'You, Sirs, and your Party' (i.e. the International) 'are alone upholding the 
ancient German tradition, i.e. the humanitarian spirit, etc.' 
Well now. This letter figures in the action for alleged high 
treason which the Saxon government has been forced by Bismarck 
to bring against Liebknecht and Bebel and which is still being 
heard. 2 4 It gave Bismarck a pretext to order Bebel's arrest after 
the adjournment of the German Reichstag. 
At the very moment when some scurrilous journals were 
denouncing me to Thiers as an agent of Bismarck, Bismarck was 
a K. Marx, 'First Address of the General Council of the International Working 
Men's Association on the Franco-Prussian War'; K. Marx, 'Second Address of the 
General Council of the International Working Men's Association on the Franco-
Prussian War'.

imprisoning my friends on a charge of high treason against 
Germany and ordering my arrest should I visit Germany. 
4. Some time before the Armistice157  the good Jules Favre —as 
the General Council pointed out in a letter to The Times of 
12 June, 3 of which I enclose a reprint (No. II)—requested us 
through his private secretary, Dr Reitlinger, to organise public 
demonstrations in London in support of the 'government of 
defence'. Reitlinger, as the General Council stated in its letter to 
The Times, went on to say that we must not speak of 'the Republic' 
but simply 'of France'. The General Council refused to collaborate 
in demonstrations of that  kind.  But the whole thing proves that the 
French government itself regarded the International as an ally of 
the French Republic against the Prussian conqueror—and indeed 
it was France's sole ally during the war.

through you. 
I cannot immediately lay my hands on the German journals 
relating to the Lefaivre incident,0  but in the issue of the Volksstaat 
(published in Leipzig and edited by Liebknecht), Mr Bigot will 
find the letter from Lefaivre as well as editorial comments on that 
letter. The trial of Liebknecht and Bebel has, by the bye, gained 
widespread notoriety. 
In No. 63 of the Volksstaat (5 August 1871) (see marked 
passage) Mr Bigot will observe that the proceedings against 
Liebknecht, Bebel, etc., for planning high treason axe going ahead 
and that Lefaivre's letter figures amongst the documents used in

Delpech, the Prosecutor-General, who made it clear that it was

Dear Moor, 
Enclosed The Public Opinion with a fuller version of the article 
from the National-Zeitung. 279 You will see that immediately 
following the passage incriminated in 'The International', there is 
a further passage, prudently omitted by the latter, which must be 
answered. The paper has just lost a court case against 
Goldschmidt and Jenny Lind and is acquiring a reputation for 
premeditated libel. I would accordingly insist not only on their 
inserting a reply, but on  AN AMPLE AND COMPLETE  APOLOGY,  IN THE  SAME  PLACE 
OF THE PAPER. 
It would also serve the National-Zeitung damn well right if we 
were to turn the tables on them and publish the article 
simultaneously in the Volksstaat. That louse Zabel feels far too 
much at his cannibalistic ease again under Bismarck. 
Rozwadowski had a post as a schoolmaster in Somerset without 
salary, but free board and lodging, until 15 December.3 He leaves 
for there tomorrow. He must learn English there. I have procured 
his release — agent's commission  £1.1/-,  clothes £3.7/-, debts 
£1.13/-,  travel and incidental expenses £1.10/-, total  £7.11/-.  In 
addition I laid out £12.12/- yesterday for Dupont's children,b 
which has cleaned me out. Just after we left this morning to settle 
the matter, your wife arrived with a letter for me from Tibaldi, 
holding out other prospects for Rozwadowski from Davydov. But 
it was now too late and Rozwadowski had to leave for Somerset, at 
least for the moment. If we find out later that the arrangements 
can be changed to suit all sides, a Frenchman like Beaufort could 
take over his post and he could return and obtain the Russian 
money. 
I hope the sea air does you good.

Be so good as to write out the contents of the opposite page3

Today is the first fine day here. Yesterday and the day before it

Frankel is here and was elected a member of the GENERAL COUNCIL 
yesterday, along with Chalain and Bastelica. He was here today 
with Rochat; does not seem to be a high-flyer. 
Allsop was in the COUNCIL yesterday and gave me the sum of 
5 shillings for you for the refugees. He is leaving town once more 
and will be writing to you again. In the crush there was of course 
no chance to speak with the deaf man in more detail. 
Jung's letter saying that I should launch an appeal to the Yankees 
came yesterday at 7 p.m., i.e. too late. It was resolved that you 
should be charged with formulating the appeal282 and despatching 
it by STEAMER next Saturday.2 If you can't, I could do something of 
the sort; the enclosed letter proves that it would be worth it. 
Yesterday between £2 and £3 came in altogether! 
The whole meetingb  was used once more for the following 
debate: Weston, Hales, Applegarth and another of our English­
men had been invited by George Potter to a meeting at which 
Dr Engländer (!) was also present. Potter produced the informa­
tion that Sir Edward Watkin had made an agreement with the 
Canadian government according to which the Versailles prisoners 
would be sent to Canada where they would each be given 1 ACRE of 
land—presumably Thiers is behind it in order to get l id of them. 
Weston was enthusiastically in favour, il radote de plus en plusf In 
the end Longuet, Theisz and Vaillant moved the next item on the 
agenda—it was quite well done.

because my health was very much impaired as a result of 
overwork. I shall probably return to London next week, how-

80 to 90 by now). The General Council has kept them above water 
up to now, but in the past two weeks our funds have been melting 
away just like that, while the number of arrivals increases daily, so 
that they are in a very deplorable condition. I hope that 
everything possible will be done from New York. In Germany all 
the resources of the party are still absorbed by the victims of the 
police persecution there, as is the case in Austria, ditto Spain and 
Italy. In Switzerland they not only have a part of the refugees 
themselves to support, albeit a small part, but they also have to aid 
the members of the International as a result of the St Gallen 
LOCKOUT. 285 Lastly, there are also some refugees in Belgium, though 
only a few and, what is more, the Belgians have to aid them, 
particularly in getting them through to London. 
Owing to these circumstances, up to the present all the funds 
for the bulk of the refugees in London have been raised 
exclusively in England. 
The General Council now includes the following members of the 
Commune: Serraillier, Vaillant, Theisz, Longuet and Frankel, and 
the following agents of the Commune: Delahaye, Rochat, Bastelica 
and Chalain. 
I have sent The New-York Herald a statement in which I disclaim 
all responsibility for its correspondent's absurd and wholly 
distorted report of his conversation with me.286 I do not know 
whether it has printed the statement. 
Give Sorge my regards. I shall answer his letter next week."

MARX  TO  JENNY MARX 287 
IN LONDON 
[Brighton,]  25  August  1871 
Dear Jenny, 
I forgot  to  tell  you  yesterday3  of a  curious événement*  The 
second  day  after  my  arrival here, 278 I met a  chap  in a  waiting 
posture  at the  corner  of my  street.  He  was  the  same  man  whom  I 
had told  you  about before  as  having accompanied Engels  and 
myself  on our way  HOME  on a  number  of  occasions. Engels  had 
thought  he was  a spy and we  once gave  him a  'hint'.  As you  know, 
GENERALLY SPEAKING  I am not  good  at detecting spies.  But  this fellow 
has obviously  and  undeniably dogged  my  every step down here. 
Yesterday,  I became  fed up  with  it, so I  stopped, turned round 
and stared at him with my notorious  EYEGLASS.  WHAT DID  HE DO?  He 
doffed  his hat  very humbly  and  today  he no  longer honoured  me 
with the  pleasure  of his  company. 
I wrote  a detailed letter  to Dana today giving  him,  among other 
things,  an  extensive account  of the  adventures  in  Luchon  and 
Spain.212  He  will certainly  be able  to use it for  his Sun. It is  EXACTLY 
THAT  SORT OF THING THE YANKEES ARE FOND OF.  I have of course dealt with 
the matter  in terms which  can do the  children  no  harm—should 
they stay longer over there. 
No one is so  deaf  as those  who  will not  hear!  And  so OLD STEPNEY 
IN REGARD  TO  THE  REFUGEES!  Jung and I told him the whole story 
without mincing words. Hales sent  him  subscription lists/  I told 
him of the  letter from Davydov,288  and  lastly  I advised  him of the 
steps taken here  to obtain subsidies.  But for all  that the old  jackass 
has  TILL  NOW NOT LOOSENED HIS  PURSE-STRINGS  NOR SEEMS  HE AT ALL WILLING  TO DO 
so. Yesterday  he  told  me  with  his  eunuch's voice that  he had  sent 
subscription lists—to Boston,  and he  showed  me a  letter that  he 
had written  to a  local lady, asking  for  contributions.  But he 
himself!  NOT HE! 
The fellow  is altogether  'off his  head',  as Jung says. Jung came 
here last Saturday  d and  left again  on  Monday.  He  brought  his two 
boys with  him and  before  his  departure  he  told Stepney that  he

was going  to a  family  he  knew  of who  would look after  the  boys. 
Stepney went with  him and  after Jung had  SETTLED  everything with 
the LANDLADY,  Stepney said:  'BUT  I WANT FOR  8 DAYS  TO TAKE CARE OF THE BOYS 
MYSELF.'  And so all was  UNSETTLED  again. 
On the  whole,  the  weather here  has  been stormy  and  rainy,  so 
that I have  not  ceased  to have colds with accompanying cough. 
But the  wonderful  air and the  bath that  I take daily have  had a 
very good effect on my  GENERAL STATE  OF HEALTH.  Throughout the 
whole period  I have regretted nothing  so much  as the  fact that 
you were  not  here. Anyhow,  you  must also—by hook  or by 
crook—have,  if not a  summer trip,  at least  an  autumn  one  this 
year. 
As for  those Swiss oafs, Schneider  and  Zichlinsky  (the  'tailor'3 
was a highly suspect individual even  in Germany), they will soon 
realise that they  are not in  Germany  any  more.b 
I find that  too  many Proudhonists  are  being admitted  to the 
General Council,  and on my  return  I shall insist  on the  admission 
of Martin  and Le Moussu  as an  antidote. 
Brighton—where, incidentally,  I am  living  the  life of a  hermit 
on the whole—is naturally  ABSORBED  IN THE  GREAT POISONING CASE, 
obviously  a pure outbreak  of hysterical boredom  on the  part  of a 
SILLY,  love-sick, 35-year-old  SPINSTER  in comfortable circumstances. 
The reports  by The  Daily Newsc  and The  Daily Telegraph  PARIS 
CORRESPONDENTS  on the  Versailles trial268 are truly loathsome, infamous 
products of  PENNY-A-LINERS.

MARX TO HERMANN MEYER 289 
IN WASHINGTON 
[Brighton, around 25 August 1871] 
We are greatly in want of money... The affaire of the Commune 
increased our duties and obligations, while the war preceding it 
cut off our Continental supplies. We are now almost overwhelmed 
with letters from different parts of this country (England), from 
people wanting information about the International, and sections 
are being established in the provinces. There are also Irish 
sections in the course of formation, and we now have an Irish 
secretary on the Council in the person of MacDonnel,3 of Fenian 
notoriety.6 Besides that, we have had applications from the East 
Indies and New Zealand. 
The Paris Federal Council is to be reorganised. After all Thiers 
has caught but very few of our men. There is not a prominent 
member of our association amongst all his prisoners, and there are 
but two or three missing, who must have been killed in the last 
days of fighting, as we cannot get either tale or doings of them. 
Many who were reported over and over again as shot, even 
detailed accounts given, have turned up again, and are now safely 
here b or in Switzerland. 
There is great distress among the refugees here, and between 
fifty and sixty are without the means of subsistence. Money comes 
in very slowly. There is to be an appeal issued to your 
working-men28 which we trust will be liberally responded to.

will during the continuance of the courts-martial in France268 
no visitors be any longer admissible. This strict measure had 
been rendered necessary by the intrusion of French police

I have the honour to inclose a subscription list for the French 
refugees. Their numbers (they are now 80-90) [are] increasing 
daily (there are now about 80 [in] number)b while our funds are 
quite exhausted. Their case is truly deplorable. The best thing 
would be, if possible, to form a separate committee charged to 
find employment for those men whose great majority consists of 
skilled workmen and artists.

Dear Mr Sidorov,3 
Thank you for your good offices in the matter of the Gazette des 
Tribuneaux, which reaches me regularly, and also for the maps b; 
having consulted Rozwadowski, I think that I shall indeed have to 
write to a German bookseller. Rozwadowski, incidentally, has 
secured a post as schoolmaster in a boarding-school, unpaid, but 
with laundry, board and lodging up till December—he cannot fail 
to learn English there, after which it will be easy to find him 
something else. 
As to the books, it now transpires that they have not yet reached 
the second-hand bookshops and must be paid for at publication 
prices with discounts ranging from 16 to 20 per cent. Let me 
know by return whether you authorise me to buy them on these 
terms,  in which case you will receive them in a few days' time; they 
are as follows: 
Lecky, Rationalism" 
Tylor, Primitive Culture 
Lubbock, Origin of Civilisation6 
Maine, Ancient Law 
Ditto,  Rural Communities,'' 
and, if it is to be had for 10/- or less, 
Buckle, History of Civilization. 
Someone has just interrupted me, and so I am obliged to close 
this letter.

212 130. Marx to Collet. 6 September 1871 
For my own part I consider the feeling of 'alarm' not one 
peculiarly adapted to lend a scientific and objective point de vue. 
I regret not being able to fulfil your wish. I have gone through 
the whole round of my Continental friends but found no one in 
possession of some of the numerous reviews and extracts of my 
booka  that have appeared in Italian and French. The French 
edition in extenso has been cut short by the Prussian war. 14 
Neither translation nor review has appeared in English. Two years 
since my friend F. Engels sent a very accurate analysis of Das 
Kapital to the Fortnightly, but it was returned with the remark that 
'it was too scientific for the English Review-reader'. 29S 
I do not know of what manifestoes you speak. Save the address 
on The Civil War in France and Mr. Washburne,b which I had the 
honour to send you, the General Council has, since September 
1870,  published no manifesto except those on the Franco-Prussian 
Warc  which I hereby forward you. Apart [from] the manifestoes 
published by the French and Prussian police in the name of the 
International, and which I have declared to be forgeries in La 
Vérité (Paris), d no manifesto has besides been published in the 
latter times. The so-called Swiss manifesto, printed in The Times,' 
is, as The Examiner of last Saturday justly remarked, 
'a garbled translation of a French version, itself far from accurate... It issues, 
not from the International Workingmen's Association, but from some of its Swiss 
members'.'

[London, after 9 September 1871] 
Gentlemen, 
In reply to etc. I beg to say that I believe M. MDa to be well 
qualified as to character, talent, & political position, for the 
undertaking he has in view. As a representative Irishman, he will 
be able, as far as I can judge, to command considerable support in 
more than one way among his countrymen; he has very extensive 
connections among them; and personally, I believe him to be 
strictly honourable. 
Requesting you to make use of the above in strict confidence 
and without my guarantee, I am etc.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 11 September 1871 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I do not require any credentials—as secretary for Italy and 
Spain, I shall probably have to represent 2 countries in any 
event.299 If you send anyone you could nominate 2 others; the 
French here are also nominating 3. Alternatively, you could send 
credentials for 3, but they must be here by Saturday.3 
Marx and I do not deal in secret first names; we each have only 
300 
one. 
Why have you not sent any copies of the German edition of the 
Address226? We are daily being pestered for it here. I must say 
that to treat us in this manner is not the way to encourage us to 
do any further work. I shall not send another line of manuscript, 
nor Marx either, until you finally condescend to treat us with the 
barest minimum of common decency. 
To compare Monsieur Goegg with Odger is a bit strong. In the 
first place, Odger has in his own way a thousand times as much 
political understanding as that stupid Badener, and in the second 
place, as secretary of the LONDON TRADES COUNCIL, 301 Odger was the 
spokesman for some 100,000 workers, and he still represents a 
whole sector of them, whereas I have never heard that Mr Goegg 
ever spoke for anyone other than a few reactionary Baden 
numbskulls in Switzerland, the only authentic 'numbskulls' still 
surviving in fossil form. But when you provide space in the 
Volksstaat for the lucubrations of such people, 277 while we throw 
the Odgers out,238  it is evident that there the parallel ends. As for 
Bernhard Becker, whose shabby dealings began when he was still 
here,  in London, and are known to you, you could have knocked 
us over with a feather when we read that you had forgiven him 
his rascality because of his—abilities! I had always believed 
hitherto that his shabby dealings, his total rascality, could only be 
overlooked, if at all, on the grounds of his stupidity! Well, you will 
see what joy your latest acquisition will bring you. The wretch will 
never forgive you for having had to come to you 'with a rope

round his neck'. 302 And as for the newspaper, better none at all 
than one of his sort! If Mr B. Becker has not betrayed the Party 
(which I do not know for certain), it can hardly be his fault. The 
man who could write that swinish book on Lassalle, his lord and 
master, is capable de tout? The book was of interest to us, but it 
rendered its author worthy of undying contempt. 303 
Marx was very astonished to see the notice in the Volksstaat 
announcing that you intend to publish a history of the Commune, 
etc., etc. (No. 73, p.  4). 304 I was no less surprised than him. How 
you arrived at the idea was a complete mystery to us. / have not 
promised you anything of the sort, and we have no idea where 
you might have heard the news that someone would write an 
authentic history of the Commune for the Volksstaat by agreement 
with the General Council. At any rate, since the General Council 
has been mentioned, could we be informed, since there would be 
questions about it? 
You will soon have some jolly persecution to look forward to. 
There can be no doubt that Bismarck has just agreed a general 
witch-hunt with the Austrians and the Italians.305 Bismarck does 
not feel too strongly about it  himself;  he wants to work off a little 
personal rancour and would also like to force the workers' 
movement back into the Schweitzer-channel that is useful to him. 
For the rest he is, as a Junker, a speculative bourgeois and a 
superficial, successful statesman (which he is all in one person), 
quite without fear of the red spectre. Austria is now being put in 
fear of the International, just as it was fooled about the 
'revolution' and the 'Carbonari' in 1823 at Verona and later in 
Carlsbad.b306 But that you will come in for your share, is clear 
enough. 
My wifec  and Mrs Marx are in Ramsgate; I shall also spend a 
few days there this week, but shall be back here on Saturday. 307 If 
you do not come, I hope that Bebel will. We were very pleased to 
hear that the babyd is doing so well. With best regards from Marx 
and me to all your family.

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 308 
IN HOBOKEN 
[London,] 12 September 1871 
Dear Mr Sorge, 
Kindly convey the enclosed letter from our Irish secretary, 
MacDonnell, to John Devoy. 
I had no time to reply to you in greater detail. We are so 
extremely busy here at the present time that I have been 
compelled for the past 3 months (and still am) to interrupt some 
very urgent theoretical work. 
I shall merely say in regard to the Rules that the English EDITION 
is the sole authentic one.a The conference265 will issue authentic 
versions in English, French and German,309 which is also necessary 
because various Congress resolutions relating to the Rules must be 
incorporated in them. 
The CENTRAL COMMITTEE in New York 151 must not forget: 
1. That the General Council had contacts in America long 
before the Committee was established; 
2. That, as far as the Addressb is concerned, it was on sale in 
London, and hence anybody had the right to send it to his friends 
in America at his own expense. The first shipment to New York 
was so small because the first edition was sold out in two days, 
which is why I did not get the number of copies allotted for my 
shipments. 
3. In Par. 6 of the Rules it is expressly stated that  'NO  INDEPENDENT 
LOCAL SOCIETY SHALL BE PRECLUDED FROM DIRECTLY CORRESPONDING WITH THE 
GENERAL COUNCIL', and in Washington, for example, the branch 
declared that it did not want to enter into contact with New 
York.310.

Dear Jenny, 
The Conference  is at  last coming  to an end  today. 265 It was  HARD 
WORK.  Morning  and  evening sessions, commission sessions  in 
between,  HEARING  OF WITNESSES, REPORTS  TO BE  DRAWN  UP AND  so FORTH.  But 
more  was  done than  at all the  previous Congresses  put  together, 
because there  was no  audience  in front  of which  to stage rhetorical 
comedies. Germany was  not  represented  and  from Zwitzerland only 
Perret  and  Outine were there. 
Last week  the  revolutionary party  in Rome held  a banquet  for 
Ricciotti Garibaldi,  and a  report  on it in the  Rome paper  La 
Capitale  has been sent  to me. One  speaker  {il signore Luciani) 
proposed  an  enthusiastically received toast  to the  working class 
and 'a Carlo Marx  che (qui) se ne (en) è  fatto  (a  fait) l'instancabile 
instrumenta (l'instrument infatigable)'. 3 This  is a  bitter pill  for 
Mazzini! 
The news  OF  MY DEATH  b led to a  MEETING  of the  'COSMOPOLITAN SOCIETY' 
in New  York whose resolutions  in the  World  I am  sending  to 
you.311 
Tussy  has  also received  an anxious letter from  our  friends  in St 
Petersburg.312 
We had a  hard time here with Robin  and  Bastelica, Bakunin's

MARX TO GUSTAV KWASNIEWSKI 315 
IN BERLIN 
Ramsgate, 29 September 1871 
As from: 1 Maitland Park Road, 
Haverstock Hill, London 
The Conference of the delegates of the International Working 
Men's Association, which met in London last week, 265 has resolved 
that in the future no membership cards will be distributed by the 
General Council. Instead the General Council will send out stamps 
(after the manner of postage stamps) which each member should 
stick either to his copy of the Rules, or to his membership card in 
cases where, as in Switzerland, for example, national membership 
cards are issued. I shall accordingly send you a certain number of 
these stamps as soon as they become available. 
As to the Rules themselves, a new edition of them is being 
arranged for here (London) in English, French and German (the 
last is to be printed in Germany). In accordance with the 
resolutions of the Conference every member must be in possession 
of a copy of the Rules. For it is important to include in them 
additions and amendments necessitated by the various resolutions 
passed by Congress since 1866.309 
At the Conference, Germany was not represented either by 
delegates or by reports, and no financial contributions have been 
received since September 1869. It is not possible for the purely 
platonic relationship of the German workers' party to the 
International to continue. The party cannot expect services to be 
performed by the one side without any services being performed 
by the other in return. This relationship compromises the German 
working class. Therefore, I would request the Berlin Section to 
enter into direct correspondence with me, and I shall put the same 
request to all other sections, as long as the leadership of the 
Social-Democratic Workers' Party continues to do nothing about 
the organisation of the International in Germany. The laws may 
prevent normal organisation, but they cannot prevent the existing 
organisation of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party from carry­
ing out the same tasks in practice as are performed in every other 
country, tasks such as enrolling individual members, paying dues, 
sending in reports, etc.

ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV 
IN PARIS 
London, 5 October 1871 
My dear Friend, 
I found your Tetter316  on my return from Ramsgate, where 
Johnson 3 and I had just been spending a couple of days.317 
As to the money that is still owing to me, might I request you, 
first, before the end of this month to take out another quarterly 
subscription for me to the Gazette des Tribuneaux. My subscription 
expires on 31 October. Later on I may, perhaps, wish you to make 
some other purchases in Paris, so do not hasten to remit any 
money to me. As for the Buckle, b etc., I am always at your 
command. I shall also send you The Eastern Post whenever there is 
anything of interest. 
As for the firm of TpH6ep-b,c it is perfectly sound and reliable, 
and you may therefore deliver goods to it without the slightest 
misgivings. The address was certainly written by Johnson and it 
was certainly Cep.d who delivered it to the person in question. 
Moreover, it was supplied over here with a goodly assortment of 
engravings. We are temporarily rather short of this article and 
shall not be able to make any deliveries just now. 
I conveyed your letter to our friend in Lower Charles St.e He no 
longer deals with the matter in question, which has passed into 
other hands and has thus lost much of the interest it held for us.

To give you more precise information would involve entering into 
endless detail; suffice it to say that a few of the people on whose 
behalf the business was to be undertaken have behaved in a 
shameful manner, and refuse, despite our admonitions, to break 
with individuals undeserving either of credit or of trust, and even 
go so far as to accept their guidance in their speculations.318 As a 
result, their closest acquaintances have pulled out in the belief that 
it would be throwing money down the drain to encourage them in 
undertakings which would either end badly or merely serve to 
benefit out-and-out rogues. The individuals in question have, by 
the way, or so I believe, obtained what they needed elsewhere. But 
there are always a number of good honest lads whose business is 
gravely hampered by want of capital and if some way could be 
found of providing them with funds, we should be delighted. An 
approach might be made to Johnson who, as you know, is the 
general intermediary in such matters. 
My salutations to all our friends.

ENGELS TO ELISABETH ENGELS 225 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
London, 21 October 1871 
Dear Mother, 
If I have not written to you for so very long, it was because I 
wanted to answer your latest comments on my political activity in a 
way that would not give you offence. And again and again, 
whenever I read the despicable lies in the Kölnische Zeitung, above 
all the monstrous fabrications of that swine Wachenhusen, when I 
saw how the very same people who, during the war, had seen 
nothing but lies in the whole of the French press, now trumpet 
forth in Germany as gospel every police invention and every piece 
of slander about the Commune by the most venal Paris 
gossipmonger, I kept falling into a mood that little inclined me to 
my task. In the case of the few hostages who were shot in the 
Prussian manner, the few palaces burned down on Prussian 
precedent, a great hue and cry is raised—for all the rest was 
nothing but lies—, but when it comes to the 40,000 men, women 
and children whom the Versailles troops massacred with machin­
ery after people had been disarmed—no one murmurs a single 
word! However, you can know nothing of all that, because you 
have to depend on the Kölner and Elberfelder Zeitung, and the lies 
are really drummed into you. And yet you have in the course of 
your lifetime heard quite a few people denounced as veritable 
cannibals—the members of the Tugendbund S2i under the first 
Napoleon, the demagogues of 1817 and  1831,"6  the men of 
1848—and subsequently it always turned out that they were not so 
bad after all, and that the horror-stories initially put into 
circulation about them by interested parties, subsequently dis­
solved into thin air. I hope, dear mother, that you will recall this and 
give the men of 1871 the benefit of the doubt when you read of 
these imaginary atrocities in the newspaper. 
You knew that I had not modified my opinions, opinions which 
I shall soon have held for 30 years, and it could not come as a 
surprise to you that, as soon as events compelled me to do so, I 
should not only speak up for them but would do my duty in other 
respects too. You would have to be ashamed of me if I failed to do 
so. If Marx were not here, or did not even exist, it would make

absolutely no difference at all. It is therefore quite wrong to put 
the blame on him. Incidentally, I can also remember the time 
when Marx's relations maintained that I had been the ruin of 
him. 
But enough of that. The situation cannot be changed now and it 
just has to be accepted. If things are quiet for a while, the fuss will 
die down anyway and you yourself will take a calmer view of the 
situation. 
I spent some time in Ramsgate during September, 307 a small, or 
rather fairly large, seaside resort on the East coast, somewhat to 
the north of Dover. It is the most amusing resort I know, 
extremely informal, very pretty firm beach immediately beneath 
the steep chalk cliffs; the beach is full of fake Negro-minstrels, 
conjurers, fire-eaters, Punch-and-Judy shows and nonsense of that 
sort. The place is not very fashionable, but cheap and easy-going. 
The bathing is very good, and since it was cold it did me twice as 
much good, my appetite became truly insatiable and I slept fully 
10 hours a day. Although I live in one of the most healthy districts 
of London, where the air is as good as in the country, or so a 
doctor assures me, I nevertheless perceived what a difference such 
a change of air makes. You really ought to think of enjoying the 
sea air for 3-4 weeks next summer which makes even the 
healthiest more healthy. 
My interesting neighbour has for some time now left me in 
peace with her piano, she must be away. To make up for it, 
however, I have now acquired a musician on the other side, where 
some new houses have been built. There is a tailor's shop there 
and, above it, rooms are being let. Up to now, however, it is not 
too bad and I cannot complain. 
It has been raining abysmally, which comes very unexpectedly 
after the splendid autumn days we have had, and I am having to 
make a fire, whereas even 3 days ago it was so sultry that I could 
not bear to be in a room without open windows. In general, 
however, the weather here is much better than in Manchester, it 
hardly ever rains all day long, whereas in Manchester at this 
season it often rains without a break for 2-3 days on end. 
From what Hermann and Emila are saying it appeared to me 
that it will probably take some time before their relations with 
Adolf b have got back on an even keel. If they do not see each 
other for a time, that will make it easier. At all events, it is good 
that the disagreement has been resolved, at least on the main 
a Engels' brothers. See this volume, pp. 155-56. - b Adolf von Griesheim

points. Once the financial side has been sorted out, at least there 
can be no further occasion for dispute. I hope that all will resolve 
itself with time. 
For the rest, I am well and cheerful and have returned to my 
first love, namely my long pipe, having finally managed to 
discover a reasonable tobacco here. This evening I have put aside 
a special pleasure for  myself:  despite the rain I am going to the 
Viennese beerhall in the Strand, where for once I shall be able to 
drink my fill; Emil Blank junior called in for a moment a few 
days ago, otherwise I never get to see the young madcap, since I 
hardly ever go to the CITY. 
Good-bye for now, give my cordial greetings to all my brothers 
and sisters, and do not be cross with me for my long silence. 
With all my heart, 
Your 
Frederick 
You can tell Emil Blank that Marx does not need any money 
from me. But I should like to see the expression on the face of 
that same Emil Blank if J were to advise him about how to spend 
his money.

ENGELS  TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
[London,]  4 November  1871 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I could  not use  your credentials  at the  Conference.326  It had 
been resolved that countries without representatives  be  rep­
resented  by  their secretaries.  So I sat as the  member  for  Italy 
and had I  used your credentials,  I would have deprived Marx 
of his  seat  and his  vote;  so I  simply left  the  papers  in my 
pocket. 
To come back  to your unfortunate Goegg,b  his  case  is to be 
distinguished from that  of Odger  in two  crucial respects. First, 
Odger  is and  always  has  been  a worker, whereas Goegg  is by 
a of the  resolutions  of the 1871  London Conference;  see  this volume,  pp. 227 and 
231. - b See  this volume,  p. 215.

nature a petty bourgeois, and will always be so. If you count 
yourself as belonging to the same party as Goegg, we certainly do 
not. Second, we have thrown Odger out,238 while you are hanging 
on to your Goegg and won't let him go. Or are you reproaching 
us with not having clung to Odger as you have to Goegg? 
You explicitly excused your readmission of Bernhard Becker by 
saying that you badly lacked 'men of ability'. 302 You must 
therefore have considered him to be one. 
I do not know to whom I should address my 'rude comments', if 
not to you. I am beginning, it is true, gradually to accustom myself 
to the fact that you make all sorts of demands on us without it 
ever occurring to you to perform even the most self-evident 
services in return. I shall soon find it quite natural to send you the 
manuscript of an entire pamphlet, and then have to order my own 
copies from the bookseller, while at the same time reading in your 
letters that sales are going fantastically. In other countries, when 
the General Council sends a pamphlet ready for the press, it is not 
only sent, as a matter of course, the copies due to it, but also a 
share of the profits. In Germany, it is even asked to pay for the 
copies. You can bet your last penny, however, that we shall refuse 
to do so. Since I have no desire to figure in your books as your 
debtor, I am sending the invoice back with the request for a new 
one. The other things that I ordered for myself or for Marx and 
the German Workers' Society135 we shall, of course, pay for as 
soon as the invoice has been corrected. 
I have been sending you The Eastern Post regularly every week. 
One went off as recently as yesterday, along with The Times of 27 
October, which has a (well-informed) article on the Internation­
al.327  If you have not received these things, announce it at once in 
the Volksstaat. This Stieber must be made to see that we are 
keeping an eye on him. 
In the accompanying report3  you will find a reply to Schwitz -
guébel. The man  is. one of the leading intriguers in the Bakunin 
clique in the Neuchâtel Canton. They have been striving to break 
up the International in Switzerland for the past two years, ever 
since the spectacular failure of their attempt to take it over. It is 
the continuation of the Alliance de la démocratie socialiste 10 in the 
Jura. 
They have usurped the title of Comité Fédéral Romand and 
retained it despite the General Council's having forbidden them to 
a F. Engels, 'On the Company Swindle in England'.

do so.a  Now the Conference has settled the matter once and for 
all. 328 Should Elpidin send you anything for publication (which I 
scarcely think possible), the best thing would be for you to send it 
straight back to him, giving him my address and telling him that 
he should get in touch with me directly for further clarification. I 
shall then oblige him in such a manner that he will not bother you 
again. The story is too long for me to tell it here. 
You will receive the Conference resolutionsb in German and 
ready for the press in a day or two. The translation is in progress 
now. 
Sorge is taken care of. c 
For the rest, matters are proceeding excellently, in Italy we now 
have a whole mass of organs at our disposal (I enclose a list for 
publication),329 and the correspondence is so lively that it involves 
a hell of a lot of work for me. You will have seen from the copy of 
The Eastern Post6 we sent yesterday that we have established an 
ENGLISH FEDERAL COUNCIL here3S0 and so have relieved the GENERAL 
COUNCIL of all the details of purely English importance—a matter 
that had become highly necessary. An Irish COUNCIL will follow 
shortly. 
The English version of the revised Rulese is in the press, 
French, German and Italian translations are in progress. All these 
things have meant an enormous amount of work for us, since 
Marx and I had to do almost all the editing and attend to all the 
details ourselves. Moreover, Marx has been unwell again, with an 
abscess under his arm, and must still stay at home because of a 
cold. 
Johannard has arrived here from the Commune and has taken 
up his old seat in the General Council again. Jules Vallès is also 
here,  Ranvier arrived during the Conference, Sicard in the last 
few days. You will have heard that Jaclard—one of the best of 
men—escaped from prison with Okolowicz and has arrived safely 
in Berne. They really are splendid people for the most part; of 
course, among such a mass of refugees there are inevitably a few

Dear Friend, 
Today 100 copies (50 in French and 50 in English) of the 
Conference resolutions" are being sent off to New York. The 
decisions not intended for publication will be communicated to 
you later. 
A new, revised edition of the Rules and Regulations'3 is due to 
appear in English tomorrow, and you will receive 1,000 copies for 
sale in America (Id. each). The text must not be translated into 
French and German in New York, as we are issuing official 
editions in both languages.309 Write us how many copies in each 
language will be wanted. 
I have turned over the correspondence with the German Section 
and the New York Committee' to Eccarius (he has been appointed 
to handle that at my suggestion),ssl since my time does not allow 
me to perform this function properly. 
Section 12 (New York) has submitted proposals to the General 
Council that it be constituted the leader in America. Eccarius will 
have sent the decisions against these pretensions and for the 
present Committeed to Section  12.332 
As for the Washington BRANCH (which has sent the General 
Council a list of its members), the New York Committee went too 
far.310 It had no right to demand anything but the number of 
members and the name, etc., of the corresponding secretary. 
More in the next letter (this week).e

MARX TO FERDINAND JOZEWICZ*33 
IN BERLIN 
[London,] 6 November 1871 
Dear Friend, 
I enclose a copy of the French translation of the Conference 
resolutions.3  They have also appeared in English, and the German 
translation will be sent off to the Volksstaat tomorrow. 
The single English edition of the Rules and Regulations of the 
Internationalb will come out tomorrow. We shall probably publish 
a German edition in Leipzig and a French one in Geneva. 
According to the latest Conference resolutions every member must 
possess a copy of the Rules. I shall send you the stamps as soon as 
they are available. 
With regard to Berlin, my view is that public meetings 'in 
general' should not be held until more propaganda has been made 
on the spot. In the meantime, however, every situation with 
broader implications and of public interest should be exploited 
both for meetings and for printed manifestoes.334 
The next opportune occasion will be the scandalous trial of the 
members of the ex-committee of the Social-Democratic Party in 
Brunswick, where the International figures as the central feature 
of the indictment.335 However, it will be as well to bide one's time 
until the public sessions, which will focus the attention of Germany 
on Brunswick. 
In the same way, the proposed laws concerning the Internation­
al which the government intends to lay before the German 
Reichstag will provide a favourable opportunity. It is to be hoped 
that the German workers will come out as energetically as the 
Spanish workers did against similar government interventions. 
I made one mistake in my last letter.0 Bebel had sent me one 
detailed report in 1870, at the time when we had settled on Mainz 
as the venue for the Congress (shortly before the outbreak of the

It would be pointless to wait for the revision of Chapter I,218

not been able to get to my theoretical work (and the foreseeable 
future holds out small prospect of an improvement in this 
respect).

there are circumstances where you are in duty bound to occupy 
yourselves with things much less attractive than theoretical study 
and research.

MARX  TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 284 
IN HOBOKEN 
[London,]  9 November  1871 
Dear Friend, 
I sent  you 100  copies  of the  Conference resolutions3  the day 
before yesterday, 50 in  ENGLISH  and 50 in  FRENCH. 
This week 1,000 copies of the  ENGLISH REVISED AND OFFICIAL STATUTES 
AND REGULATIONS  b will  be sent  to you. Try to  sell them. 
The  GENERAL COUNCIL  has large expenditures to make as a result of 
the various tasks  it was set by the  Conference. 
We shall have  an  official French edition  of the  REVISED  STATUTES, 
etc., printed  in Geneva,  and the  official German edition printed  in 
Leipzig. Write  and  tell us approximately  how  many  COPIES  of each 
will be required in the  UNITED STATES. 
A section  of the  International, Section française  de 1871  (about 
24 strong),  has  been formed here among  the  FRENCH REFUGEES,  which 
immediately clashed with the  GENERAL COUNCIL  because we de­
manded changes  in its  Rules. 838 It will probably result  in a  SPLIT. 
These people  are  working together with some  of the  French 
refugees  in Switzerland,  who in  turn  are  intriguing with  the men 
of the  Alliance  de la  démocratie socialiste (Bakunin), which  we 
dissolved. 339 The  object  of their attack  is not the  governments  and 
ruling classes  of Europe, allied against  us, but the  General Council 
of London,  and  particularly  my  humble  self.  This  is  their 
gratitude  for my  having spent nearly  5 months working  for the 
refugees  and  having acted  as their vindicator through  the  Address 
on the  Civil War.c 
I defended them even  at the  Conference, where  the  delegates 
from Spain, Belgium, Switzerland,  and  Holland expressed their 
misgivings lest  the  General Council endanger  its  international 
character through  too  large  an  admixture  of French refugees.340 
But in the  eyes  of these 'Internationalists'  it is in  itself  a sin for 
'German' influence (because  of German science)  to predominate  in 
the GENERAL COUNCIL.

As for the New York  CENTRAL COMMITTEE, 151 the following: 
1. According  to the  Conference decisions,  see II, 1, in the 
future,  it must call itself  FEDERAL COUNCIL OR FEDERAL COMMITTEE OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
2. As  soon  as a  much larger number  of  BRANCHES  has  been 
established in the  DIFFERENT STATES,  the most practical thing to do 
will be to  call  a congress  of the  different  SECTIONS—following  the 
example  of Belgium, Switzerland,  and  Spain2—to elect  a FEDERAL

The Brunswick court's indictment  of the  local  EX-COMMITTEE,

document. 335 
All of us  regret that  you  intend  to resign from  the  Committee.  I 
trust, however, that your decision  is not  final.  I myself often think 
of doing  the  same,  as the  affairs  of the  International take  too 
much  of my  time  and  interrupt  my  theoretical work.

2. But as far as the private correspondence with West, etc., is 
concerned, the General Council has absolutely nothing to do with it A 
number of the English members of the General Council, in 
particular George Harris and other sectarians of the school of 
O'Brien, the  CURRENCY  QUACK  DOCTOR,343  are in contact with West et Co. 
Anything they may write to the UNITED  STATES  has no official status. If 
you can supply proof that Harris, etc., have taken it upon themselves 
to write to America in the name of  the  GENERAL  COUNCIL,  we shall soon 
put a stop to such  mischief. 
3. As far as any other correspondence from members of the 
General Council is concerned, we are not in a position to forbid it. 
Firstly, I do not see what objection can be made to the 
correspondence between Eccarius and Jessup. It has not come to 
my notice that Jessup, one of our oldest correspondents in the 
UNITED STATES, has been acting against the New York COMMITTEE.161 
Secondly, my correspondence with Sigfrid Meyer. Meyer and 
Vogt were mandataries of the GENERAL COUNCIL; I do not know 
either of them personally, but had regarded Meyer, and have 
always thought of Vogt, as having long been active members of 
the workers' party. 344 I have been advising them both for a long 
time now to join the organisation established by the Central 
Committee in New York. 
I have not had a letter from Vogt for some years now, and if he 
does intrigue, he will certainly find no support from me. I am 
concerned only with the interests of your movement, and not with 
private individuals. 
As for Sorge, I am no more acquainted with him personally 
than I am with Meyer and Vogt. It is my conviction, however, that 
the General Council owes him a profound debt of gratitude for 
his activities—a belief which I have repeatedly expressed in the 
GENERAL COUNCIL. 
4. You must strive to win the support of the TRADES  UNIONS  AT ALL 
COSTS. 
This letter is addressed only to you personally. You must not 
show it to anyone except Sorge. 
Write to me soon. 
Salut fraternel 
Yours sincerely,

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 345 
IN MILAN 
London, 13 November 1871 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
Esteemed Friend, 
In reply to your kind letter of the 1st inst., I regret to have to 
tell you that we have no contacts in Milan at the moment, apart 
from the Gazzettino Rosa, to which we send documents for 
publication, 346 but which has otherwise made no offers so far on 
the establishment of sections, etc. The movement in Italy in 
International terms broke out so suddenly and unexpectedly that 
everything is still very disorganised and, as you know, the 
Mordecaians3 are doing their best to hamper the organisation. 
That there must be useful elements in Milan is obvious enough, if 
only from the fact that the Gazzettino Rosa has a reading public. In 
the meantime, the only thing you can do is to try and discover 
them. I promise to send you the address of the first one to get 
into contact with me from there. This will undoubtedly happen 
shortly, since my name will soon enough become known 
everywhere as secretary for Italy through the flood of forthcoming 
publications from the General Council. As the stronghold of 
Mazzini's followers hitherto, and as major industrial city, Milan is 
of great importance for us, particularly since, if it falls to us, the 
areas in Lombardy where the silk industry is concentrated will 
automatically be ours, too. So anything you and your friends can 
achieve in Milan for the common cause will have a very special 
value. 
We have a strong section in Turin (address: Proletario Italiano); 
letters from Lodi (the Plebe), which presumably reported on the 
establishment of sections, have gone astray. 
I met Ricciotti Garibaldi at Marx's house this morning. He is a 
highly intelligent young man with a very calm manner, but a 
soldier rather than a thinker. However, he may turn out to be 
very useful. It is just as with the old manb; his theoretical ideas 
give more proof of his good intentions than of his clarity of vision, 
but his last letter to Petroni is invaluable to  us. 347 If the sons prove

to have the same sure instincts in every great crisis as the old man, 
they will achieve much. Can you obtain a reliable address for us in 
Genoa? We want to be able to send our things safely to Caprera 
for the old man, and Ricciotti says that a lot gets intercepted. 
Since the Mordecaians will now know my name as well, could I 
ask you to address letters for me to: 
Miss Burns, 122 R.P.R., London, N.W. (as per letter-head), and 
not to High Holborn where I only go once a week and a lot of 
post just lies around waiting. 
An inner envelope is not necessary. 
I am sending you an English paper chosen at random through 
the post and enclosing:

4. You may rest assured that I am better informed than you 
about the intrigues within the International. So when I write to 
you that letters from Boruttau with any bearing at all on the 
International (including the Manifesto already announced, which 
the aforesaid Boruttau has sent you) should not be printed in the 
Volksstaat, you have simply to make up your mind whether you 
wish to act against us or with us. If the latter is the case, then my 
instructions, which are based on a thorough knowledge of the 
circumstances, should be followed to the letter. 
5. Since we are most dissatisfied here with the way in which the 
affairs of the International have been conducted hitherto, it is my 
duty, in accordance with the instructions of the General Council, 
to make direct contact with the main centres in Germany. I have 
already made a start on this.3

Engels and myself have had no time up to now to write a Preface

candidates. They only have to pay ONE PENNY for their annual 
contribution but may subscribe more if they so wish. All you have 
to do is enter the names of new members on the cards. 
I am also sending you 30 copies of the Rules.3 Every member 
must be supplied with a copy, which costs ONE PENNY. 
In accordance with a resolution passed at the last Conference,b 
adhesive stamps are now being manufactured representing the 
value of one PENNY, and these must be affixed to the Rules in 
possession of members. 
Those who have already paid for their cards will not have to

MARX TO FRIEDRICH BOLTE 352 
IN NEW YORK 
[London,] 23 November 1871 
Friend Boite, 
I received your letter yesterday together with Sorge's report.353 
1. First of all, as to the attitude of the General Council towards 
the New York Federal Council, I trust that my letters already sent 
to Sorge (and a letter to Speyer, which I authorised him to 
communicate to Sorge confidentially)" will have disposed of the 
highly erroneous viewpoint of the German Section which you 
represent. 354 
In the United States, as in every other country where the 
International first has to be established, the General Council 
originally had to authorise separate individuals and appoint them as 
its official correspondents. But from the moment the New York 
Committee had gained some stability, these correspondents were 
dropped one after the other, although they could not be removed all 
at once. 
For some time past the official correspondence with formerly 
appointed authorised representatives has been confined to Ec-
carius' correspondence with Jessup, and I see from your own 
letter that you have no complaint at all to make regarding the 
latter. 
Except for Eccarius, however, no one was to carry on official 
correspondence with the United States but myself and Dupont as 
correspondent (at the time) for the French sections, and whatever 
correspondence he conducted was confined to the latter. 
With the exception of yourself and Sorge, I have not carried on 
any official correspondence at all. My correspondence with Sigfrid 
Meyer is private correspondence, of which he has never published the 
slightest detail, and which by its very nature could in no way be 
troublesome or harmful to the New York Committee. 
There is no doubt, on the other hand, that George Harris and 
perhaps Boon—two English members of the General Council— 
are carrying on private correspondence with Internationals in New 
York, etc. Both of them belong to the sect of the late Bronterre 
a See this volume, pp. 236, 241-42 and 244.

O'Brien, and are full of follies and CROTCHETS, such as CURRENCY 
quackery, false emancipation of women, and the like.343 They are 
thus BY NATURE allies of Section 12 in New York and its kindred 
souls.332 
The General Council has no right to forbid its members to 
conduct private correspondence. But if it could be proved to us: 
either that this private correspondence pretends to be official, or 
that it counteracts the activity of the General Council—whether 
used for publication or to drag the New York Committee through 
the mire—the necessary measures would be taken to prevent such 
mischief. 
These O'Brienites, in spite of their follies, constitute an often 
necessary counterweight to  TRADES  UNIONISTS  in the COUNCIL. They are 
more revolutionary, firmer on the LAND QUESTION, less NATIONALISTIC, 
and not susceptible to bourgeois bribery in one form or another. 
Otherwise they would have been kicked out long ago. 
2. I was greatly astonished to see that German Section No. 1 
suspects the General Council of a preference for bourgeois 
philanthropists, sectarians, or amateur groups. 
The position is quite the contrary. 
The International was founded in order to replace the socialist 
or semi-socialist sects by a real organisation of the working class 
for struggle. The original Rules and the Inaugural Address3 show 
this at a glance. On the other hand, the International could not 
have asserted itself if the course of history had not already 
smashed sectarianism. The development of socialist sectarianism 
and that of the real labour movement always stand in indirect 
proportion to each other. So long as the sects are justified 
(historically), the working class is not yet ripe for an independent 
historical movement. As soon as it has attained this maturity all 
sects are essentially reactionary. For all that, what history exhibits 
everywhere was repeated in the history of the International. What 
is antiquated tries to reconstitute and assert itself within the newly 
acquired form. 
And the history of the International was a continual struggle of the 
General Council against the sects and attempts by amateurs to 
assert themselves within the International itself against the real 
movement of the working class. This struggle was conducted at 
the Congresses,  but far more in the private dealings of the General 
Council with the individual sections.

165. Marx to Boite. 23 November 1871 255 
As the Proudhonists (Mutualists 35B) were co-founders of the 
Association in Paris, they naturally held the reirfs there for the 
first few years. Later, of course, collectivist, positivist, etc., groups 
were formed there in opposition to them. 
In Germany—the Lassalle clique. I myself corresponded with 
the notorious Schweitzer for two years and irrefutably proved to 
him that Lassalle's organisation is purely a sectarian organisation 
and, as such, hostile to the organisation of the real workers' 
movement aimed at by the International. He had his 'reasons' for 
not understanding. 
At the end of 1868 the Russian, Bakunin, joined the Internation­
al with the aim of forming inside it a second International under 
the name of Alliance de la démocratie socialiste, 10 with himself as 
leader. He—a man devoid of all theoretical knowledge—claimed 
that this separate body was to represent the scientific propaganda of 
the International, and that this propaganda was to become the 
special function of this second International within the Internatio­
nal 
His programme was a mishmash superficially scraped together 
from left and right—equality of classes (!), abolition of the right 
of inheritance as the starting point of the social movement 
(Saint-Simonist nonsense), atheism as a dogma dictated to the 
members, etc., and, as the main dogma, (Proudhonist) abstention 
from the political movement 
This children's primer found favour (and still has a certain 
hold) in Italy and Spain, where the real conditions for the 
workers' movement are as yet little developed, and among a few 
vain, ambitious, and empty doctrinaires in Romance Switzerland 
and Belgium. 
For Mr Bakunin the doctrine (the rubbish he has scraped 
together from Proudhon, St. Simon, etc.) was and is a secondary 
matter — merely a means to his personal self-assertion. Though a 
nonentity theoretically, he is in his element as an intriguer. 
For years the General Council had to fight against this 
conspiracy (which was supported up to a certain point by the 
French Proudhonists, especially in Southern France). At last, by 
means of Conference resolutions 1, 2 and 3, IX, XVI, and XVII, it 
delivered its long-prepared blow.356 
Obviously the General Council does not support in America 
what it combats in Europe. Resolutions 1, 2 and 3 and IX now give 
the New York Committee the legal weapons with which to put an 
end to all sectarianism and amateurish groups, and, if necessary, 
to expel them.

3. The New York Committee would do well to express its full 
agreement with the Conference decisions in an official letter to the 
General Council 
Bakunin, personally threatened, moreover, by Resolution XIV 
(publication of the Nechayev trial in the Egalité),* which will bring 
to light his infamous doings in Russia, is making every possible 
effort to get protests started against the Conference among the 
remnants of his following. 
For this purpose he has got into contact with the riff-raff among 
the French refugees in Geneva and London (a numerically weak 
component, anyway). The slogan issued is that the General 
Council is dominated by Pan-Germanism (or Bismarckism). This 
refers to the unpardonable fact that / am by birth a German and 
actually do exercise a decisive intellectual influence upon the 
General Council. (N. B. The German element in the  COUNCIL  is 
two-thirds weaker numerically than the English, and also weaker 
than the French. The crime therefore consists in the fact that the 
English and French elements are dominated by the German 
element theoretically (!) and find this domination, i. e. German 
science, very useful and even indispensable.) 
In Geneva, under the patronage of the bourgeoise, Madame 
André Léo (who at the Lausanne Congress was so shameless as to 
denounce Ferré to his Versailles executioners 357), they have 
published a paper, La Révolution sociale, which polemicises against 
us in almost literally the same words as the Journal de Genève, the 
most reactionary paper in Europe. 
In London they tried to establish a French Section,338 of whose 
activities you will find an example in No. 42 of Qui Vive!, which 
I enclose. (Ditto the issue containing the letter from our 
French secretary, Serraillier.)368 This Section, consisting of 20 
people (including many mquchards^), has not been recognised 
by the General Council, but another, a much larger section, 
has. 359 
In fact, despite the intrigues of this bunch of scoundrels, we are 
carrying on great propaganda in France — and in Russia, where 
they know what value to place on Bakunin, and where my book on 
capital is just being published in Russian.360

dissolution) was the same Durand whom we expelled from the 
Association as a mouchard. 361 
The Bakuninist abstentionists from politics, Blanca  and Albert 
Richard of Lyons, are now paid Bonapartist agents. The evidence is 
in our hands. Bousquet (of the same clique in Geneva), the 
correspondent in Béziers (Southern France), has been denounced 
to us by the section there as a police officer! 362 
4. With regard to the resolutions of the Conference, let me say 
that the whole edition was in my hands, and that I sent them first 
to New York (Sorge) as the most distant point. 323 
If reports on the Conference—half true and half false— 
appeared in the press before that, the blame rests on a delegate to 
the Conference,11 against whom the General Council has instituted an 
inquiry.0 
5. As for the Washington Section, it applied first to the Gene­
ral Council in order to maintain contact with it as an indepen­
dent section.310 If the affair is now settled, it is useless to return 
to it. 
With regard to sections the following general remarks ap-
ply: 
(a) According to Art. 7 of the Rules, sections that wish to be 
independent can apply directly to the General Council for 
admission (* 'no independent local society shall be precluded from 
directly corresponding with the General Council'*). II: Arts 4 and 
5 of the Regulations: *'Every new branch or society'* (this refers 
to * 'independent local societies') 'intending to join the Interna­
tional is bound immediately to announce its adhesion to the 
General Council!'* (II: Art. 4) and *'The General Council has the 
right to admit or to refuse the affiliation of any new branch etc' * 
(II: Art. 5). 
(b) According to Art. 5 of the Regulations,6 however, the 
GENERAL COUNCIL has to consult the FEDERAL COUNCILS or COMMITTEES 
beforehand regarding admission, etc., and 
(c) according to the decision of the Conference (see V: Art. 3 of 
the Regulations), no section will be admitted any more from the 
outset that takes a sectarian name, etc., or (V: Art. 2) does not 
constitute itself simply as a Section of the International Working

Eccarius has been appointed, at my request, secretary for all

N.B. ad"  POLITICAL  MOVEMENT : The POLITICAL  MOVEMENT  of the working 
class naturally has as its final object the conquest of POLITICAL POWER for 
this class, and this requires, of course, a  PREVIOUS  ORGANISATION of the 
WORKING  CLASS  developed up to a certain point, which arises from the 
economic struggles themselves. 
But on the other hand, every movement in which the working 
class comes out as a class against the ruling classes and tries to 
coerce them by PRESSURE FROM WITHOUT is a POLITICAL MOVEMENT. For 
instance, the attempt in a particular factory, or even in a particular 
trade, to force a shorter working day out of the individual 
capitalists by STRIKES, etc., is a purely economic movement. The 
movement to force through an eight-hour law, etc., however, is a 
political movement. And in this way, out of the separate economic 
movements of the workers there grows up everywhere a political 
movement, that is to say a movement of the class, with the object 
of achieving its interests in a general form, in a form possessing 
general, socially binding force. Though these movements presup­
pose a certain degree of PREVIOUS organisation, they are in turn 
equally a means of developing this organisation. 
Where the working class is not yet far enough advanced in its 
organisation to undertake a decisive campaign against the collec­
tive power, i.e. the political power, of the ruling classes, it must at 
any rate be trained for this by continual agitation against, and a 
hostile attitude towards, the policies of the ruling classes. Otherwise

game that Messrs Gladstone et Co. still succeed in playing in 
England up to the present time.

ENGELS TO CARMELO PALLADINO 
IN NAPLES 
[Draft] London, 23 November 1871 
Citizen Palladino, 
I have just received your letter of the 13th and thank you for 
the Report on the History of the Naples Section,863 which I shall 
submit to the General Council at its next meeting. "Whatever 
decisions the Council may arrive at in regard to the publicity to be 
given to the contents of that memoir, the necessary discretion will 
always be observed. 
I am sorry you think yourself duty-bound to tell me that you in 
no way accept the resolutions of the last Conference.265 Since it is 
evident from your letter that an organised section of the 
International no longer exists in Naples, I can only assume that 
the above declaration expresses your individual opinion and not 
that of the Naples Section, now forcibly dissolved. Being anxious, 
however, to avoid misunderstandings, I am answering your 
objections in detail. 
(1) You are not satisfied 
'with the way in which the said Conference was convened, which certainly did 
not conform to the regulations laid down by our General Rules'.3 
To that accusation there are two rejoinders: 
a Here and below Engels quotes in Italian.

260 166. Engels to Palladino. 23 November 1871 
(a) It is indeed true that our General Rules make no provision 
for Conferences, but only for Congresses; they were drafted in the 
somewhat naïve belief that governments would leave us to our 
own devices. 3 Since the governments made it impossible for us to 
convene a Congress in 1870, the sections, having been directly 
consulted, confirmed and extended the powers of the General 
Council, and empowered it to decide upon the time and place at 
which the next Congress should meet. In 1871 the governments 
made the meeting of a Congress even more impracticable.b 
We have proof of this, should you doubt it. But you will not; 
'the Naples Section of the International no longer being able to 
meet' after 20 August  1871,364  it could not elect a delegate to the 
Congress. And the same goes for France, Germany and Austria; 
the Federal Council in Spain was forced to take refuge in 
Portugal! So what could we do? There remained the precedent of 
1865 when, for various reasons, the semi-public Congress was 
replaced by a private Conference held in London, the convening 
and actions of which were ratified by the next Congress.365 You 
might tell me that such precedents are authoritarian and 
bourgeois survivals unworthy of the true revolutionaries of the 
proletariat, to which I should reply that the General Rules, 
Administrative Regulations, resolutions passed by the Congresses, 
etc., etc., belong in the same category, but that unfortunately no 
association, however revolutionary, can do without such things. So, 
the General Council, on its own responsibility, suggested to the 
sections that the impracticable Congress be temporarily replaced 
by a practicable Conference, practicable because the delegates 
would not be known to governments. The sections gave their 
assent, none protested, and the Council is prepared to answer to 
the future Congress for its action. 
(b) As for the actual convening of the Conference, it was 
completely in order. All the Federations, all the individual sections 
in regular communication with the General Council, were notified 
in good time. 
a The following passage is crossed out in the original here: 'But you are a lawyer, as 
far as I know, and so you should know that in every society written laws coexist with 
rules laid down by practice.' - b Crossed out in the original: 'In France, the 
Association was disbanded; in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria and Hungary it was 
harassed by persecutions which totally disorganised it. The only countries where 
the Internationals could at least gather openly were America, England, Belgium 
and Switzerland. And even in Belgium a law against the International was 
promulgated. The election of delegates to a Congress which, in keeping with the 
Rules,  would be expected to hold public sessions alongside administrative sittings 
became impossible.'

166. Engels to Palladino. 23 November 1871 261 
(c) Furthermore, if any observations on the legality or the 
method of convening the Conference were to be made, this should 
have been done before or during the Conference. None were 
made. 
(2) You complain of the 'small number of delegates'. For that, 
the General Council is not to blame. Nonetheless, Belgium, Spain, 
Holland, England, Germany, Switzerland and Russia were directly 
represented. As to France, it was represented by practically all the 
members of the Paris Commune then in London, and I hardly 
suppose you would dispute the validity of their mandate. If Italy 
did not send delegates, you must look to your government.3 
(3) You say that these delegates 'have arrogated to themselves 
the rights peculiar to a General Congress'. This runs completely 
counter to the facts. The resolutions of the Conference in no way 
affect the tenor of the Rules.b Some merely reaffirm the 
resolutions of previous Congresses, hardly if at all familiar to 
sections and members of recent date. Others are of a purely 
administrative nature. Far from lying outside the competence of a 
Conference, neither the former nor the latter go beyond even that 
of the General Council. 
(4) You then go on to object to the 
'very tenor of such resolutions which appear to you to be in direct opposition to 
the principles of our Association as laid down in our General Rules'. 
With this I totally disagree and look to you to provide the  proof. 
The founders of the International, those who drafted the Rules 
and the resolutions of our Association's Congresses, were very well 
represented at the Conference, and you will forgive me if, in the 
first instance, I lend credence to their interpretation of those 
Rules and to the interpretation given by successive Congresses 
ever since. Pray do not forget that the International has its own 
history and that history—of which it has every reason to be 
proud—is the best commentary on the Rules; that the Interna­
tional in no way intends to renege that glorious history and that, 
at this moment, the spontaneous movement of the proletarian 
masses in favour of our Association—a movement that is more 
marked and more enthusiastic in Italy than anywhere else—is the 
most striking ratification, not only of the letter of the Rules, but 
also of the whole of that history. Whatever your fears in regard to 
a Crossed out in the original: 'and it is high time you offered effective opposition 
to it.' - b Crossed out in the original: 'They are of a purely administrative na­
ture;  the General Council had the right to adopt them itself had it wished to 
do so.'

the great responsibility the General Council has taken upon  itself, 
that Council will remain ever loyal to the flag entrusted to its care 
seven years ago by the faith of the working men of the civilised 
world. It will respect individual opinions, it is prepared to transfer 
its powers to the hands of its mandators, but as long as it is 
charged with the supreme direction of the Association, it will see 
to it that nothing is done to vitiate the character of the movement 
which has made the International what it now is, and will abide by 
the resolutions of the Conference until such time as a Congress 
has decided otherwise. 
In accordance with Resolution X of the Conference3  there can 
be no objection to the reconstitution of the disbanded Naples 
Section under the name of Federazione Operaia Napolitana, or 
under any other name whatsoever.

My dear Friend,

own. For the past four weeks I have been confined to the house, 
having had abscesses, operations, etc., secundum legem artis.b 
Nevertheless, what with the business of the International on the

translation.218  Since our friends in St Petersburg were becoming 
ever more pressing, I was forced to leave the chapter as it stands 
and make no more than a few minor alterations." As I told you in 
London, I have often asked myself if the time has not come to 
resign from the General Council. The more the society develops, 
the more my time is taken up and I must, after all, finally have 
done with Das Kapital Moreover, my resignation would rid the 
International of the threat of Pan-Germanism, a threat, or so say 
Messrs Rouillier, Malon, Bakunin, Robin & Co., represented by 
myself. b 
I have spoken to my doctor about your case. He tells me: 
1. If you are to set up in London as an English  doctor,  it would 
not be sufficient to pass the examinations over here. You would be 
obliged to do at least two years of study in a London hospital (or 
at university). They would take into account Belgian courses in 
some branches of the science but not all. 
2. On the other hand, you can set up here as a doctor with your 
Belgian qualifications without passing further examinations and 
without attending any English courses. There are French and 
German doctors here who practise in this way. True, there are 
certain fields, not many of them (forensic medicine, for example), 
in which you would be precluded from working, but that is a 
minor matter. 
3. Lastly you could—as many foreigners have done before 
you—combine the two methods, namely start practising straight 
away and at the same time take the necessary steps to transform 
yourself later into an English doctor and ultimately become *the 
physician of Her Most Gracious Majesty.* 
So you can see, my dear friend, that there are many roads that 
lead to Rome. * Drop me a few lines about this subject.* 
The conduct of the Belgian Federal Council vis-à-vis the 
General Council strikes me as suspect. Mr Hins and his wife—I 
am speaking frankly—are Bakuninists and Mr Steens has doubt­
less discovered that his eloquence is insufficiently admired. In 
Geneva it is even being said, as Utin wrote and told me (he doesn't 
believe it, needless to say), that you have sided with the Alliancists 
who are in league with André Léo, Malon, Razoua, etc.

consequences. England, the United States, Germany, Denmark,

Italians, Sicily and Rome, the vast majority of the Romance Swiss, 
all the German Swiss and the Russians in Russia (as distinct from 
certain Russians abroad linked with Bakunin) are marching in step 
with the General Council. 
On the other hand, there will be the Jura Federation in 
Switzerland (in other words the men of the Alliance who hide 
behind this name), Naples, possibly Spain, part of Belgium and 
certain groups of French refugees (who, by the by, to judge by the 
correspondence we have had from France, would not appear to 
exert any serious influence there), and these will form the 
opposing camp. Such a split, in itself no great danger, would be 
highly inopportune at a time when we must march shoulder to 
shoulder against the common foe. Our adversaries harbour no 
illusions whatever about their weakness, but they count on 
acquiring much moral support from the accession of the Belgian 
Federal Council. 
Every day people keep asking me for the Anti-Proudhon.* I could 
carry out some degree of propaganda amongst the best minds in 
the French emigration were I to have the few copies of my piece 
against Proudhon you were kind enough to promise me.

MARX TO LAURA AND PAUL LAFARGUE366 
IN SAN SEBASTIAN 
London, 24[-25] November 1871 
*My dear Laura and Toole,a 
What with the International business, what with the  * visits from 
members of the Commune, * I have not found the time to write. 
How my time is encroached upon, you may judge from one case. 
At Petersburg they have been translating Das Kapital into Russian, 
but they had reserved the first chapter because I had asked them 
to do so, since I intended to re-write it in a more popular manner. 
Since the events of Paris I was continually prevented from 
fulfilling my promise and was at last compelled to limit myself to a 
few alterations, in order not to stop the progress of the publication 
altogether.* 218 
As for the calumnies against Toole, *it is all moonshine*, a 
canard put about by the French branch No. 2. Serraillier, the 
secretary for France,  * wrote immediately to Bordeaux. The six 
sections there existing have answered by a vote of absolute 
confidence in the illustrious Toole. 
As to the scandals that have taken place at London and Geneva, 
I must begin from the beginning. 
Amongst other French refugees we had admitted to the General 
Council Theisz, Chalain and Bastelica. The latter was hardly 
admitted when he proposed Avrial and Camélinat, but* est modus 
in rebus 0 * and we found that there were now enough  * Proudhon-
ists *in our ranks. On different pretexts the election of these two 
worthies was therefore delayed until the Conference, and dropped 
after the Conference, the latter having passed a Resolution 
inviting us not to admit too many refugees.0  Hence  * the great 
rage of citizens Avrial and Camélinat. 
*On the Congress itself the Resolution on the political action of 
the working class was violently opposed by the Bakuninists— 
Robin, the Spaniard Lorenzo and the* Corsican Bastelica. *The

latter, an empty-headed and very pretentious fellow, got the worse 
of it and was rather roughly handled. His main quality*—i.e. his 
amour-propre—*got him into steam*. 
There was a further incident. 
* On the affair of the  * 'Alliance of Socialist Democracy'10  * and 
the*  dispute in Romance Switzerland, *the Conference appointed 
a * committee * (of which I was a member) and which met in my 
house.367 Outine on the one side, Bastelica and Robin on the 
other, were summoned as witnesses. Robin behaved in the most 
shabby and cowardly manner.* After having had his say (at the 
beginning of the meeting) he declared that he must leave and 
rose,  intending to go. Outine told him that he must stay, that the 
investigation was going to be a serious one and that he would not 
like to discuss him in his absence. Robin, in an admirable series of 
tactical moves, approached the door. Outine apostrophised him 
violently, saying that he would have to accuse him of being the 
mainspring of the Alliance's intrigues. * Meanwhile, to secure a 
safe retreat,* the great Robin had partly opened the door and, 
like a true Parthian,368 delivered a parting shot at Outine with the 
words: 'Then I despise you.' 
On 19 September, with Delahaye for intermediary, he communi­
cated the following epistle to the Conference: 
'Called upon as a witness in the matter of the Swiss dispute, before the 
committee nominated to examine it, I put in an appearance in the hope of 
contributing to an appeasement. 
'Having been directly impugned, I state categorically that I do not accept the 
role of accused and will refrain from attending those meetings of the Conference 
at which the Swiss question is to be discussed. 
'19 September 1871. 
'P. Robin.' 
Several members of the Conference, amongst whom De Paepe, 
demanded that the fellow be expelled forthwith from the General 
Council but on my advice it was resolved that he be asked to 
withdraw his letter and that, in case of refusal, the matter be left 
in the hands of the General Council. Since Robin obstinately 
persisted in standing by his letter, he was eventually expelled from 
the Council. 
* Meanwhile, he had addressed to myself the following  * billet 
doux of 28 September. 
'Citizen Marx, 
'I have been under great personal obligations to you, nor have these been a 
burden to me so long as I believed that nothing could change my respectful

feelings of friendship towards you. Today, being unable to subordinate my 
gratitude to my conscience, and sorry though I am to break with you, I believe I 
owe you the following statement. 
'I am convinced that, yielding to personal animosity, you have uttered or 
supported unjust accusations against the objects of that animosity, members of the 
International, whose sole crime is not to share the same. 
'P. Robin.' 
* I did not think it worth my while to answer to  * R. R. R.— 
Robin the sheep. (He was already known by that name to Rabelais, 
who specifically includes him in Panurge's flock.)369 Let me now 
return to our other sheep.370 
After the Conference, Avrial and Camélinat urged the forma­
tion of a French branch ('London French Section of 1871'). 338 
Collaborating therein were Theisz, Bastelica (who had already 
decided to go back to Switzerland and wished to create a prop for 
Bakunin in London before he left) and Chalain (a completely 
worthless wag). They published their own Rules in the paper Qui 
Vive!" of which more anon. Those Rules were contrary to the 
General Rules. In particular, these gentry (there were 20 of them, 
amongst whom several informers; their secretary was the illustri­
ous Durand, publicly branded an informer by the General Council 
and expelled from the International 361) arrogated to themselves 
the right to nominate delegates to the General Council with impera­
tive mandates, at the same time resolving that no one belong­
ing to their section must accept nomination as a member of the 
General Council save when sent as delegate by the Section it­
self. 
Even before their Rules had been confirmed by the General 
Council, they had the impudence to send as Council delegates 
Chautard (a cretin who, during the Commune, was the laughing­
stock of Paris) and Camélinat. They were politely invited to 
withdraw and await the confirmation of their Rules by the General 
Council. I was entrusted with a critique  thereof.  This first missive 
from the Council b to the new Section was still couched in 
conciliatory terms. All they were asked to do was to delete the 
articles contrary to the spirit and the letter of the General Rules 
and Regulations. 
They were enraged. Avrial (in collaboration with Theisz and 
Camélinat) wrote a reply which cost him a fortnight's work *and 
a 'Association internationale des travailleurs. Section française à Londres de 1871. 
Statuts', Qui Vive!, No. 6, 8-9 October 1871. - b K. Marx, 'Resolution of the General

to which the last literary finish was given* by Vermersch (Le Père 
Duchêne)." 
The said individual had wormed his way into their ranks 
because, with the aid of a few typographers (refugees), they had 
founded the paper Qui Vive!, under the provisional editorship of 
Le Verdet (a Schopenhauerian philosopher). Vermersch made 
much of them and stirred them up against the General Council in 
order to get hold of the paper—and in this he succeeded. 
They sent Bastelica to Switzerland, whence they received a 
proclamation of policy: The General Council was under the yoke of 
Pan-Germanism (meaning me), authoritarian, etc. The prime duty 
of every citizen was to help bring about the fall of the said 
usurping Council, etc. All this emanated from Bakunin (acting 
through the Russian N. Zhukovsky, Secretary of the Alliance in 
Geneva,b  Guillaume, etc.) whose clique (far from numerous in 
Switzerland by the by) had coalesced with Madame André Léo, 
Malon, Razoua and a small group of other French refugees SS9 who 
were not satisfied with playing second fiddle or * no part 
whatever.* 
Incidentally, all the idiots who had been members of the Federal 
Council in Paris, or who falsely made themselves out so to have 
been—such as, e.g., Rouillier, that brawler, braggart and drunken 
sot—had deluded themselves into thinking they would be 
admitted—as of right—as members of the General Council. 
Theisz (who had been nominated treasurer of the General 
Council, and not secretary for France) and Bastelica handed in 
their resignations from the Council on the grounds of the article 
in their Rules prohibiting them from accepting nomination by the 
Council. 
I eventually replied to the letter embellished by old man 
Vermersch, whose wit is far more Flemish than French. So 
crushing was this replyc and at the same time so ironic that they 
resolved not to continue their correspondence with the Coun­
cil. Hence they were not recognised as a section of the Interna­
tional. 
Old man Vermersch had become editor-in-chief of Qui Vive!. 
In No. 42 he printed a letter371  signed by Chautard, Chouteau 
(already denounced as an informer by Rigault in Patrie en 
danger 72), by Landeck —who had given his word to Mr Piétri (see 
a A. Avrial, 'Aux Citoyens membres du Conseil général de l'Internationale'. -
b Secretary of the Geneva Section of the Alliance of Socialist Democracy - c K. Marx, 
'Resolution of the General Council on the French Section of  1871'.

the last trial of the Internationalists in Paris) that he would 
withdraw from the International and from politics"—*and [by] 
similar  riff-raff*  in which they denounce the Resolution of the 
Conference which declares that the German working men (who 
demonstrated against the annexation of French provinces and, 
later, for the Commune, and many of whom are at this very 
moment suffering persecution at the hands of Bismarck) have 
done their duty, and adduce this as flagrant proof of 'pan-
Germanism'! 
This was rather too much for those zanies Theisz, Camélinat 
and Avrial. They refused to put their signatures to it. As members 
of the administrative council of Qui Viw/,.they also fell out with 
Vermersch over an immoral novel he had published in the 
feuilleton. c Vermersch, who had no further use for these gentry, 
proceeded, without naming names, to attack them in Qui Vive!. 
His nauseating articles have also led to quarrels with other 
refugees, and I believe that he yesterday had his face slapped by 
Sicard.373  Now they are determined to relieve him of his 
editorship. We shall see! He is believed to be paid by Versailles to 
compromise the Communards. To cut the story short: in London 
the conspiracy has failed. The French branch No. 2 is in complete 
disarray (needless to say, it was pushed by Le Lubez, Bradlaugh, 
Besson, etc.). Another and far larger French section has been 
formed which is in agreement with the General Council. 359 
In place of those who have resigned, we have nominated as 
members of the Council Ant. Arnaud, F. Cournet and G. Ranvier. 
In Geneva the 'Alliance', with André Léo, Malon, etc., is 
publishing a little journal La Révolution sociale (edited by one 
Claris) in which they openly attack the General Council and the 
Conference. Pan-Germanism (German and Bismarckian intellects), 
authoritarian, etc., etc. The 'Jura Federation' (still the same old 
bunch, but under another name) has held a tiny little Congress at 
Sonvilliers (Bernese Jura) at which it was resolved that all the 
sections of the International be invited to join the Jura Federation 
in order to bring about the meeting, at the earliest opportunity, of 
a special Congress at which the conduct of the Council should be 
reviewed and the resolutions of the Conference annulled as being

contrary to the principle of autonomy which those resolutions 
'openly infringe'.374 In particular, they protest against Resolutions 
II, 2, 3, IX (Political action by the working class), XVI and XVII.356 
They have not ventured to mention Resolution XIV, which is 
especially distasteful to Bakunin because it would reveal to the 
whole of Europe the turpitudes for which he was responsible in 
Russia." 
The attitude of the Federal Council in Madrid (manipulated by 
Bakunin and Bastelica) is highly suspect. Since Lorenzo's depar­
ture Engels has received no reply whatever to his many letters. 
They are imbued with the doctrine of abstention in politics. Engels 
has written and told them today that, if they persist in their 
silence, steps will be taken. b In any case Toole  MUST  ACT. I shall send 
him English and French copies of the new edition, revised and 
enlarged, of the Rules and Regulations.309 
Our adversaries are indeed unfortunate. As I have already said, 
the first secretary of the dissident Section in London was 
G. Durand whom we unmasked as an agent of Versailles. The 
Bakuninists Blanc and Albert Richard (of Lyons) sold themselves 
to Bonaparte. They were over here to enrol members under his

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 375 
IN SAN SEBASTIAN 
[London, 25 November 1871] 
My dear Toole," 
Thank you for your letter of which I made good use on the 
Council. My ultimatum to the Federal Council in Madridb  goes off 
today, by registered mail; I tell them that, if they persist in their 
silence, debuemos procéder como nos la dictarâ el interés de la 
InternacionaU If they fail to reply, or do so in an unsatisfactory 
manner, we shall at once appoint you plenipotentiary for the 
whole of Spain. In the meantime, our Rules confer on you, as on 
any other member, the right to form new sections. It is important 
that, in the event of a split, we should continue to have a 
pied-à-terre in Spain, even if the whole of the present organisation 
were to go over, lock, stock and barrel, to the Bakuninist camp; 
and you will be the only person we shall then be able to count 
upon. So do what you can to resume communications everywhere 
with the men who might be of use to us in such an event. These 
Bakuninists are absolutely determined to transform the Interna­
tional into an abstentionist  society,  but they are not going to succeed. 
La Federaciôn of Barcelona and La Emancipacian of Madrid arrive 
here only at very irregular intervals, so that I cannot know 
whether the intrigue has not already begun to betray its presence 
in these journals. But they have always preached abstention, which 
probably seems to them a question of far greater import than 
economic questions. So that's where they end up with their 
a Paul Lafargue's nickname - b  F. Engels, 'To the Federal Council of the Spanish 
Region in Madrid'. - c We shall have to take such steps as the interests of the 
International dictate.

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 377 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 29 November 1871 
My dear Sorge, 
I hope you have at last received at New York the Resolutions of 
the Conference and the different letters I sent you.a I send 
together with this letter the 3 last Eastern Post reports on the 
sittings of the General Council. They contain, of course, only what 
is meant for public use. 
In regard to financial matters I have only to remark: 
1) the New York Committee 151 has nothing to pay but 2d per 
piece for the pamphlets on the Civil War it has received. It will 
a See this volume, p. 241. 

=====第308页=====
274 172. Marx to Sorge. 29 November 1871 
pay Id per piece for the Statutes and Regulations à fur et mesure 
that they are sold. But you ought to write us how many French 
and German editions of the Statutes etc. you are in want of. 
Besides what you want immediately, you will perhaps find useful 
to have a certain stock in reserve. 
2) With regard to the money sent us for the refugees, the 
General Council wants an express written declaration that the 
General Council alone is responsible for its distribution amongst 
the French refugees, and that the so-called 'Society of French 
refugees at London'378 has no right of control over the Council. 
This is necessary, because, although the mass of the above-
named society are honest people, the committee at their head are 
ruffians, so that a great part—and the most meritorious part of 
the refugees—does not want to have anything to do with the 
'Society' but to be relieved directly by the Council. We, therefore, 
give a weekly sum for distribution to the Society, and distribute 
another sum directly. 
It is the above said ruffians who have spread the most atrocious 
calumnies against the General Council without whose aid (and 
many of its members have not only given their time, but paid out 
of their own purse) the French refugees would have 'crevé de 
faim'*. 
I come now to the question of MacDonnell.379 
Before admitting him, the Council instituted a most searching 
inquiry as to his integrity, he, like all other Irish politicians, being 
much calumniated by his own country-men. 
The Council—after most incontrovertible evidence on his 
private character—chose him because the mass of the Irish workmen 
in England have more confidence in him than in any other person. 
He is a man quite superior to religious prejudices and as to his 
general views, it is absurd to say that he has any 'bourgeois' 
predilections. He is a proletarian, by his circumstances of life and 
by his ideas. 
If any accusation is to be brought forward against him, let it be 
done in exact terms, and not by vague insinuation. My opinion is 
that the Irishmen, removed for long time by imprisonment, are 
not competent judges. The best proof is—their relations with The 
Irishman whose editor, Pigott, is a mere speculator, and whose 
manager, Murphy, is a ruffian. That paper—despite the exertions 
of the General Council for the Irish cause—has always intrigued 
against us. MacDonnel was constantly attacked in that paper by an 
a starved to death

173. Engels to Lavrov. 29 November 1871 275 
Irishman (O'Donnell) connected with Campbell (an officer of the 
London Police) and an habitual drunkard who for a glass of gin 
will tell the first constable all the secrets he may have to dispose of. 
After the nomination of MacDonnell, Murphy attacked and 
calumniated the International (not only MacDonnell) in The 
Irishman, and, at the same time, secretly, asked us to nominate him 
secretary for Ireland. 
As to O'Donovan Rossa, I wonder that you quote him still as an 
authority after what you have written me about him. If any man 
was obliged, personally, to the International and the French 
Communards, it was he, and you have seen what thanks we have 
received at his hands. 
Let the Irish members of the New York Committee not forget 
that to be useful to them, we want above all influence on the Irish in 
England, and that for that purpose there exists, as far as we have 
been able to ascertain, no better man than MacDonnell. 
Yours fraternally, 
Karl Marx

My dear Sidorov,"

EaKyHHHi>'s,a  whose intrigues have been causing us no end of 
labour. Things are approaching a crisis and open warfare will 
shortly break out in the press. A clean split is in the offing. In 
short the matter will be decided before long. I shall not attempt to 
give you the details—it would take too long and they are too 
boring. What with all this tomfoolery to contend with, it need 
hardly be said that neither Johnson 0 nor I have had any time for 
work. 
Thank you for your further disbursements on my behalf in the 
matter of the Gazette des Tribuneaux. 
As to Bpo6A.c we have been informed by Po3Ba40BCKHH,d who 
left his first position, but found another one a few days later.e We 
have done all we could but, considering the man's obstinate 
character and ferocious pride, we have had to be very tactful. 
However we think we have succeeded to the point where at least 
he will not lack for necessities. You see, he refuses all medical help 
and it will be even more difficult to overcome this prejudice. 
Johnson is suffering from a slight attack of bronchitis and from 
one or two furunculi that are more troublesome than serious. 
Yesterday he attended the Council for the first time in a month. 
Apart from that he is tolerably well. The abominable weather we 
have been having here has given everyone colds. 
As to the intrigues over here, they dwindle in importance day by 
day. The few honest men, who allowed themselves to be carried 
away, have withdrawn and left the field open for the out and out 
riff-raff about whom there is no need to bother one's head.f It is 
worse in Switzerland, since MaAOHi>,g etc., have fallen into the trap 
over there, some through spinelessness, others through vanity. So 
much the worse for them—the world can't stop turning because 
of their blunders!

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 381 
IN SAN SEBASTIAN 
London, 9 December 1871 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
My dear Lafargue, 
Herewith a line or two on matters in Spain. There must have 
been internal struggles within the Spanish International, struggles 
that were finally decided in our favour. That, in my view, explains 
their continued silence and the resolution finally taken to break it. 
I had written to Mora on the 25th,45 on the 28th Mesa wrote to 
you382 and on the 29th Mora wrote me a letter saying they knew 
nothing about the calumnies and intrigues against the General 
Council I had mentioned to him, etc. However, the first of the two 
issues of La Federation that subsequently reached us carried the 
resolutions passed at the Conference,3  and the second an article on 
resolution No. IX reprinted from the Emancipaciôn, and with this 
we have every reason to be satisfied. 383 Mesa's letter is even more 
explicit. In Spain, then, we have won our case. I replied to Mora 
immediately and trust that everything will go well from now on. 
Come to that, the others had done their work well and, as usual, 
a K. Marx and F. Engels, 'Resolutions of the Conference of Delegates of the

had had recourse to some pretty vile methods. La Revolution 
sociale of 23 November published an article which had appeared 
in the Barcelona  Federaci&n  of 19 November to the effect that the 
emissary of the Swiss dissidents, etc., had arrived down there and 
that the Barcelona sections, having satisfied themselves of the 
revolutionary character of the dissidents' principles, etc., had 
accepted the offer of alliance made by these people. We have 
looked through the relevant issue of La Federation but cannot find 
the article. The issue of 3 December provides the explanation: it 
says that the article did not reflect the opinion of the sections or 
even of one section, but only that of one solitary editor of the paper, 
who had slipped it in behind the backs of the editorial committee! 
The victory won in Spain has much reduced the field of conflict. 
There remain only the French branch, which is not recognised 
here (15 members),338 the Geneva branch, the Jurassians, who are 
avowed adversaries, and the Italians, whose attitude is doubtful. 
But I have been working hard at Italy and we have now begun to 
shift the battleground; from private intrigue and correspondence 
we are moving into the public arena. Mazzini has given us an 
excellent opportunity, for in an article in his paper he has made 
the International responsible for Bakunin's words and deeds. So 
here was a chance to attack Mazzini and disavow Bakunin at one 
and the same time. I did so forthwith and sent the.article to all 
our Italian journals. 384 Some at least will publish it, but others are, 
I fear, too much hand-in-glove with Bakunin to do so. But with 
this article I have advised all of them of the adherence of the 
Spaniards to the Conference and of the progress of the 
International in Spain reported by Mesa. That will have an effect; 
they will see that the others have been telling them nothing but 
lies about Spain. In fact their policy was to win Spain over by 
telling her that Italy was unanimously on their side and vice versa. 
We may still have a few unpleasantnesses in Italy, but the decision 
of the Spaniards to come over to our side will decide the 
matter—UPON  THE  WHOLE—all  along the line. As to the  CANTANKEROUS 
Jurassians, we shall go for them in the very near future. 385 
I shall be much relieved when all this business has been settled 
once and for all. You wouldn't believe how much work, 
correspondence, etc., all this has caused us. For weeks past Moor, 
Serraillier and I have been unable to turn to anything else. And I, 
poor devil, have had to write long letters, one after the other, in 
Italian and Spanish, two languages I scarcely know! 
In France we are doing famously. Twenty-six journals have 
offered to publish our documents.

It is devilish cold here and you should be glad to be spending 
the winter in a warm climate. Otherwise we are keeping well, 
likewise the Marx family. Compared with their condition last 
winter, Moor's health, as also Jenny's,3 has greatly improved. Moor 
is no longer coughing so much; he has had a small abscess below 
the shoulder but the carbunculosis has cleared up and not 
returned. His liver will never revert to a normal condition at his 
age, but is working a good deal better than before, and Moor, and 
this is the main thing, is leading a more sensible existence. Jenny, 
after the repeated attacks of pleurisy she has been through, will 
probably suffer permanently from mild emphysema, but she is 
beginning to understand that she must cosset herself a little and 
not try to harden  herself,  in good time, as she used to say, to the 
cold and the bad weather. She is singing again and her voice is 
stronger and clearer than ever before.

Dear Liebknecht, 
About Schneider, the necessary steps will be taken at the local 
German Workers' Society135 next Monday.e Unfortunately too 
many of Schweitzer's followers have been allowed in, and if we did 
not have Frankel, the whole Society would have fallen into their 
hands of late. (The issues of the Social-Demokrat have just this 
moment arrived.386) How Frankel can  object,  as you demand, to his

old letter being reprinted, is not clear to me.38  He certainly 
regrets the first half of the letter; but as for the second  half,  with 
its criticism of your erstwhile bourgeois-democratic inclinations, it 
says no more than what we too wrote to you at the time.—At all 
events, the other author in the Neuer Social-Demokrat must be 
Weber. 
Against Schneider: 1. It goes without saying that the Con­
ference3  delegates were elected. To answer his other stupid 
questions would be absurd. 2. The 15-strong French contingent 
consists of 1 Commune member, Chalain; a number of drunkards; 
the same B. Landeck who declared in the course of the 
International trial in Paris that he had indeed belonged to the 
International, but would never do so again; 3 people who do not 
belong to the International at all (but only to this newly formed 
French Section in London, which has never been recognised 8)— 
and the whole fuss stems from the fact that since their rules 
contravene the Rules, no one has been willing to grant them 
recognition as the local French Section. Theisz and Avrial, the 
only decent people in the Section, have not signed this proclama­
tion, and are now trying to make overtures to us once more! In 
contrast, in the General Council there are now 8 Commune 
members (Serraillier, Frankel, Vaillant, Cournet, Ranvier, Arnaud, 
Johannard, Longuet), and we have a French Section 50 men 
strong here, which includes the most decent of the refugees in its 
numbers. 359 Rouillier is not a Commune member but a loud­
mouthed, drink-sodden cobbler. And these 15 men are described 
by the Neuer Social-Demokrat as 'the well-known French leaders'! 
What the Neuer Social-Demokrat says about the English Federal 
Council and Dilke has been taken from an intentionally distorted 
report in the bourgeois press (The Daily News, etc.) and is false. 388 
The Neuer Social-Demokrat's report from Denmark proves that 
they have absolutely no contact with people there. im However, it 
would be a good idea for you to write to H. Brix, the editor of the 
Socialisten in Copenhagen, or to his deputy, L. Pio, offering them 
correspondents' reports from Germany if they are willing in 
return to send you reports in German or English from Denmark. 
They do understand English. And anyway, you can learn enough 
Danish in a fortnight to understand the Socialisten; the Tauchnitz 
dictionary will suffice. The language has no grammar whatever.

Even if Vermersch, its editor, was not a mouchard,* his way of

inheritance, and so it died. 
Boruttau. The letter returned herewith390 shows even more 
clearly than the previous one that the ass really is entangled right 
up to his eyes in Bakunin's web. When he objects to our disavowal 
of the Alliance, or calls for compulsory atheism for all members of 
the International, is that Bakuninism or not? And when he 
expresses his partial approval of people's complaints on matters of 
which he knows nothing—every word he writes about the 
Conference is false—is that Bakuninism or not? And you would 
like to play him off against them? He may be 'honest', but when it 
comes to those honest dolts with their vast, silent expectations, I 
would much rather have their enmity than their friendship. The 
muddled blockhead will not receive a single line from us here.b 
The events in Geneva391  will either have opened his eyes, or else 
pushed him entirely into the ranks of the Bakuninists, where he 
belongs. Why don't you get him to send you the Révolution sociale, 
especially Nos. 5, 6 and 7? I presume that you read the Egalité; 
that is absolutely essential to keep yourself au courant 
You cannot understand why all the Geneva Communards 
should be against us. This problem, which has no interest at all for 
me, you can easily solve for yourself by thinking back to the 
behaviour of the various refugee associations of '49 and '50 where 
groupings were often determined by the sheer chance of being 
thrown together. All the Geneva Communards are confined to 
3 men: Malon, Lefrançais and Ostyn; the rest are people without 
any name at all. 
When you say that the non-representation of Germany at the 
Conference was the fault of Marx's mystery-mongering, we have 
to reply that this is not the case. Marx merely wrote to say that the 
police should learn nothing of it. Is it not possible for you to 
inform your own committee or other local groups about the 
Conference, without its coming to the ears of the police? That 
would be a fine piece of 'organisation'! We did indeed want to 
hold the Conference privatim, i.e. unbeknown to the continental 
police, but that does not mean that if you and Bebel could not 
attend, you should not have taken steps to ensure that others 
might come! Marx emphatically rejects this allegation.

unobtrusive action and propaganda-making without forcing one­
self on the general public, in contrast to French loud-mouths à 
la Pyat who called for a daily dose of murder announcements and 
against whom measures have been taken. 393 
In Spain we are in the clear, we have gained a resounding 
victory. The relevant Conference resolution has been recognised 
(you can find the Emancipation article on it in the Egalité 38 ) and 
even the business of abstaining from elections, on which they still 
insist for the moment, is about to crumble. Incidentally, this 
abstentionist ploy is just confined to the few Bakuninists and the 
remnants of the Proudhonists (we are rid of the majority) and has 
suffered a severe defeat this time. The matter is settled as far as/ 
Spain is concerned. 
It was about the English company swindle that I wrote to you.a I 
know nothing of German ones. Have you any material on this? 
Without that nothing can be done.394 
Your view that the German Internationalists do not need to pay 
dues,  and that, in general, it is a matter of complete indifference 
whether the International has few members in Germany or many, 
is the exact opposite of ours. If you have not asked for the 
contributions of 1 silver groschen per person per annum, or if you 
have used them up yourselves, you will have to come up with your 
own justification. How you can imagine that the other nations 
would bear your share of the costs, so that you might come 
amongst them 'in the Spirit', like Jesus Christ, while saving your 
flesh and your money,—is something I quite fail to comprehend. 
At all events, this Platonic relationship has got to stop and the 
German workers must either be in the International or out of it. 
The French find themselves subjected to pressures of a completely 
different order, and we are better organised there than ever. If you 
personally treat the matter as being of no importance, we shall 
have to turn to others, but we shall clear the business up one way 
or the other, on that you may rely. 
The French and English versions of the Rules take up less than 
1 sheet of print,b309 so that special supplement will probably not be 
necessary—should this not be the case, let us know how much the 
costs of typesetting, on the one hand, and the cost of the special 
supplement, on the other, come to, and we shall see what we can 
do.

MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
IN SAN SEBASTIAN 
[London,] 18 December 1871 
My dear Laura, 
In the first instance my best thanks for the offer of Toole.b395 I 
accept it under two express conditions, 
1) that if the enterprise fails, I have to pay the sum advanced 
with the usual interest upon it, 
2) that Toole does not advance more than the 2,000 frs. The 
expression of the Editor that this is only wanted for the beginning 
seems to me ominous. At all events Toole must stipulate that his 
obligations refer only to this 'beginning'. 
I prefer in every respect a cheap popular edition. 
It is a fortunate combination that a second German edition has 
become necessary just now. I am fully occupied (and can therefore 
write only a few lines) in arranging it, and the French translator 
will of course have to translate the amended German edition.396  (I 
shall forward him the old one with the changes inserted.)

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 381 
IN MADRID 
London, 30 December 1871 
My dear Friend, 
Yesterday evening, when I was on the point of writing a pretty 
tart letter to the Spanish Council regarding the translation and 
publication of the Bakuninists' manifesto,397 a letter arrived from 
you which gave me a great deal of pleasure. Although I am sorry 
that circumstances should have necessitated your going to Madrid, 
it is most fortunate that you should be there at the moment, for 
the coyness and silence of the Spanish Council are really such as to 
invite a somewhat unpleasant interpretation. Though I wrote to 
Mora 24 days ago,c I have had no reply, or rather, for all reply, 
the publication of the hostile manifesto; if it were not for your 
letters, what could we make of this? 
I am sending you herewith the resolutions of the 30 sections in 
Geneva in case they have not come your way. Likewise the 
Romance Committee's reply to the Bakuninists and / can only hope 
that the 'Emancipacion' will provide its readers also with a translation of 
that excellent piece.*98  In the same issue of L'Egalité you will find 
several other articles relating to this debate and to the meeting of 
the 30 sections. For the time being the Genevans' reply will 
suffice; needless to say, the General Council must at once take the 
matter in hand and will reply in a circular embracing all phases of 
the dispute from its inception 385; as you can imagine, it will be 
lengthy and will take us some time. Meanwhile, what the 
Spaniards must be made to realise is [the following]: 
a Charles Etienne Lafargue - b Laura Lafargue's nickname - c  F. Engels, 'To the 
Federal Council of the Spanish Region in Madrid'.

1) It is plainly apparent from the Sonvilliers circular what these 
gentry are after. The attack on the Conference3 was no more than 
a pretext. What is now being attacked are the Basle resolutions399 
which, for the Association, have the force of law and which have to 
be obeyed by the General Council. This is an act of open rebellion 
and it is fortunate that these people should have shown their 
hand. But 
2) who were the authors of those Basle resolutions? The 
General Council in London? Certainly not. They were put forward 
by the Belgian delegates (amongst them Robinl the Bakuninist) 
and they were most warmly supported by whom?—Bakunin, 
Guillaume, Schwitzguébel, etc., the very men, that is, who are 
attacking them today as having, by their authoritarian character, 
demoralised the General Council. Not that this has prevented 
Guillaume and Schwitzguébel from signing the self-same circular. 
We have witnesses over here and, unless Sentinon and Farga 
Pellicer have been blinded by the spirit of sectarianism, they must 
surely remember this (if they were at the meeting, which I do not 
know).  But then things were different. The Bakuninists believed 
that they were certain of a majority and that the General Council 
would be transferred to Geneva. It turned out otherwise, and 
resolutions which, had they been passed by a General Council of 
their choosing, would have been as revolutionary as might be, 
became all at once authoritarian and bourgeois! 
3) The convening of the Conference was absolutely in order. 
The Jurassians, represented on the Council by Robin, who himself 
requested that the dispute be brought before that Conference, must 
have been notified of it by him since he was their regular 
correspondent. Jung, the secretary for Switzerland, could not 
continue to correspond officially with a committee which, flying in 
the face of a resolution passed by the General Council, continued 
to flaunt the title of Committee of the Romance Federation.9 The 
said resolution of the General Council1" was taken by virtue of the 
power delegated to it by the Administrative Resolution of Basle 
No. VIII (new edition of the Rules, etc., Administrative Reg­
ulations0 II, Art. 7). All the other sections were officially notified, 
and through the usual channels. 
Our friends in Spain will now realise the way in which these 
gentry misuse the word 'authoritarian'. Whenever the Bakuninists

Federal Committee of Romance Switzerland'. - c K. Marx, General Rules and

take a dislike to something, they say: 'It's authoritarian' and believe 
that by so doing they damn it for ever and aye. If, instead of 
being bourgeois, journalists and so forth, they were working men, 
or if they had only devoted some study to economic questions and 
modern industrial conditions, they would know that no communal 
action is possible without submission on the part of some to an 
external will, that is to say an authority. Whether it be the will of a 
majority of voters, of a managing committee or of one man alone, 
it is invariably a will imposed on dissidents; but without that single, 
controlling will, no co-operation is possible. Just try and get one of 
Barcelona's big factories to function without control, that is to say, 
without an authority! Or to run a railway without knowing for 
certain that every engineer, stoker, etc., is at his post exactly when 
he ought to be! I should very much like to know whether the good 
Bakunin would entrust his portly frame to a railway carriage if 
that railway were administered on the principle that no one need 
be at his post unless he chose to submit to the authority of the 
regulations, regulations far more authoritarian in any conceivable 
state of society than those of the Congress of Basle! All these 
grandiloquent ultra-radical and revolutionary catchphrases serve 
only to conceal an abysmal paucity of ideas and an abysmal 
ignorance of the conditions under which the daily life of society 
takes place. Just try abolishing 'all authority, even by consent', 
among sailors on board a ship! 
You are right, we must find some way of achieving a wider 
continental circulation for the reports of the General Council's 
meetings. I am still searching for such a way. For some time I 
have been sending The Eastern Post to Lorenzo, he having assured 
me they had someone who spoke English. Now I am sending you 
the latest issue of that journal and enclosing cuttings from earlier 
issues (care of Lorenzo). You might be able to do something with 
them for the Emancipacion. I really do not have the time to 
translate all these things  myself,  being obliged to conduct a vast 
correspondence with Italy. But I shall see what can be done—if 
there was someone in Barcelona who spoke English, might I not 
send the paper there? 
I have not seen Moor today, he is hard at work on his second 
German edition,3 but I will give him your letter this evening. We 
are very well. Jennyb is keeping well and Moor passably so. I make

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 2 January 1872 a 
Dear Liebknecht, 
First of all, Happy New Year, and then the proofs b en­
closed. 
Marx or Tussy will have written to you about the Stieberian 
escapade in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. c It was so transparent 
that no correspondence was needed to convince you of the 
deception; the cost of a telegram would have been money thrown 
away. You did right to denounce the thing as a forgery at once. 
Compare the names, most of which are false, with the correct ones 
under the Conference resolutions and you will have direct proof 
of the forgery. 400 
Marx still has your letter,401 so I cannot answer it point by point. 
At all events, you have to find a form that will make it possible 
for you to be represented at the next congress, and if no one can 
come, you could have yourselves represented by the old guard 
here.  Since in all probability the Bakuninists and Proudhonists will 
leave no stone unturned, the credentials will be closely scrutinised 
and being delegated, for instance, by Bebel and yourself personally, 
as was the case with the conference credentials sent to me, 
would not make a good impression. The Spaniards are in as bad a 
position as you but have not let themselves be side-tracked. 
Incidentally, the decision of the court in Brunswick does not set a 
precedent. 83 A downright disgrace like that, where even the laws 
of the Federal Diet402 can be dragged in, could only happen in a 
a The original mistakenly has  '1871'.  - b K. Marx, General Rules and Administrative 
Regulations of  the International Working Men's Association (German edition). - c See this 
volume, p. 571.

decadent small state. Bebel ought to protest against it in the 
Reichstag; the men of Progress236 would either have to 
support him or stand compromised before the whole of Germany. 
If I can find the time I shall send a (legal) critique of this 
pettifogging judgment to the Volksstaat.40i 
In Spain, according to a report from Lafargue (who is or was in 
Madrid), things are going well—the Bakuninists have overshot the 
mark with the violence of their manner. The Spaniards are 
workers and want unity and organisation above all else. You will 
have received the last circular of the congress in Sonvillier,374 in 
which they attack the Basle administrative resolutions as the source 
of all evil.399 That is really the last straw and we shall now take 
action. 
In the meantime, Hins, Steens and Co., in Belgium, have played 
us a fine trick (see the resolution of the Brussels Congress in 
L'Internationale 404). De Paepe shamefully let them make a fool of 
him; he wrote that all was well. However, up to now this 
opposition has kept itself within the bounds of legality and will 
likewise be dealt with when the time is ripe. Apart from De Paepe, 
the Belgians were never anything much. 
A society in Macerata, in the Romagna, has nominated as its 
3 honorary presidents: Garibaldi, Marx and Mazzini. This confu­
sion will show you very clearly the state of public opinion among 
the Italian workers. Only Bakunin's name is needed and the mess 
is complete. 
Cuttings from The Eastern Post (2 meetings)3 to follow tomor­
row; I do not have the last issue anymore and shall only get a copy 
at today's meeting. 
Best wishes to yours and to Bebel.

MARX TO MALTMAN BARRY

[Draftl 
[London,] 7 January 1872 
Dear Sir, 
I regret that you found neither me nor Mr Engels at home. You 
seem to proceed in your letters from the idea that we form a 
distinct party in the Council. If we opposed Mr Hales in what we 
considered wrong, we did only our duty d and would, under the 
same circumstances, have followed the same line of conduct

letter) - b F. Engels, 'The Congress of Sonvillier and the International'. - c K. Marx,

towards any other member of the Council.405 This, however, has 
nothing to do with party. We know of no parties in the Council. 
There are among the friends of Mr Hales very worthy men who 
have worked for a long time in our cause. 
If Mr Mottershead has 'consented to stand for the secretary­
ship',  we at all events did not invite him to do so. His position as 
paid secretary of the 'Labour Representation League'406  makes the 
thing almost impossible. Mr Engels told you expressly after last 
Tuesday's meeting 3 that his mind was not yet made up as [to] who 
was the proper person to vote for, and for the present we see 
difficulties on all sides. Hence we have resolved to leave our 
continental friends to their own discretion. 
In our opinion the important thing is, to settle the position and 
composition of the Federal Council. As to the secretaryship, it is 
mainly a personal matter which need not and, perhaps, cannot be 
settled in a hurry. At all events this will depend upon cir­
cumstances. 
Yours truly, 
K. M.

122 Regent's Park Road 
My dear Terzaghi, 
I received your letter of 4 December last year, and if I have not 
replied sooner, it was because I wanted to give you a precise 
a meeting of the General Council on 2 January 

=====第326页=====
292 181. Engels to Terzaghi. After 6 January 1872 
answer about the matter which interests you most of all, namely 
the fund for the Proletario. I am now in a position to provide it. 
We have very little money, and the millions of the International 
exist solely in the terrified imagination of the bourgeoisie and of 
the police, who cannot understand how an association like ours 
has been able to achieve such an important position without 
having money amounting to millions at its disposal. If they had 
only seen the accounts submitted at the last Conference3! But 
never mind; let them go on believing it, it will do us no harm. It 
had already been decided, on receipt of your letter, to take out a 
number of shares in the Proletario, in the name of the General 
Council represented by me, but then the news reached us of the 
split which you had caused408 and it was considered doubtful that 
the newspaper could go on being produced after it. Then there 
were the holidays, which meant that the meeting of the 26th did 
not take place, etc., etc. At last I can tell you that if you wish to 
continue the newspaper, and if there are solid grounds for hoping 
that this can be done, I am authorised to send you five pounds, 
i.e. roughly a hundred and sixty Italian lire, in return for which 
you can send me the corresponding amount of shares in my name. 
Write to me, then, by return of courier so that if, as I hope, the 
newspaper is to reappear, I can send you the money without 
delay. 
Tell me at the same time whether the addresses given in your 
last letter (C. C[eretti] Mirandola, E. Pfescatori] Bologna) will be 
enough to write to them, with no other indication of street or 
number, because I would not like my letters to be written for any 
Mordecaian409 to read. 
You will probably have been sent a circular by the congress of 
the Jura Federation in Switzerland attacking the General Council 
and demanding the immediate convocation of a Congress.374  The 
General Council will reply to these attacks, but in the meantime a 
reply has appeared in the Egalité in Geneva, 410 which I sent you 
three days ago together with two English newspapers containing 
summaries of the meetings of the General Council.b These citizens, 
who first looked for an argument with us using the pretext of the 
Conference, now attack us because we are carrying out the 
resolutions of the Basle Congress, resolutions which have the force 
of law for us and which we are obliged to carry out.399 They do not

want the authority of the General Council, not even if it were to be 
voluntarily consented to by all I would really like to know how 
without this authority (as they call it) the Tolains, the Durands and 
the Nechayevs could have been dealt with according to their 
deserts and how, with that fine-sounding phrase about the 
autonomy of the sections, they expect to prevent the formation of 
sections of Mordecaians and traitors. Besides, what did these same 
men do at the Basle Congress? With Bakunin they were the most 
ardent advocates of these resolutions proposed not by the General 
Council, but by the delegates from Belgium! 
If, however, you want to have an idea of what they have done 
and can do for the International, read the official report of the 
Federal Committee to the congress of the Jura Federation in the 
Revolution  sociale,  Geneva, No. 5, 23 November 1871, and you will 
see to what a state of dissolution and impotence they have reduced 
in one year a federation which was well established before. 411 
It seems to me that the term 'authority' is much abused. I know 
of nothing more authoritarian than a revolution, and when one 
fights with bombs and rifle bullets against one's enemies, this is an 
authoritarian act. If there had been a little more authority and 
centralisation in the Paris Commune, it would have triumphed 
over the bourgeois. After the victory we can organise ourselves as 
we like, but for the struggle it seems to me necessary to collect all 
our forces into a single band and direct them on the same point 
of attack. And when people tell me that this cannot be done 
without authority and centralisation, and that these are two things 
to be condemned outright, it seems to me that those who talk like 
this either do not know what a revolution is, or are revolutionaries 
in name only.a 
Write to me, therefore, about the matter without delay. 
Greetings and fraternity. 
Yours, 
F. Engels

London, 14[-15] January 1872 
256 High Holborn 
14 January 1872, to Terzaghi, Turin 
My dear Terzaghi, 
If I have not replied sooner to your letter of 4 December last 
year, it was because I wanted to give you a precise answer about 
the matter which interests you most of all, namely the money for 
the Proletario. 
You know that the millions of the International do not exist 
except in the terrified imagination of the bourgeoisie and of the 
governments, which cannot understand how an association like 
ours has been able to win such a great position without having 
millions at its disposal. If they had only seen the accounts 
submitted at the last Conference! 
We would have voted 150 frs for you in spite of our penury, but 
the Gazzettino Rosa arrived with the news, etc.412 This changed 
everything. If you had simply decided to send people to the future 
Congress, fine. But" what you had in mind was a Congress called 
for in a circular full of lies and false accusations against the 
General Council! And if you had only waited for the General 
Council's reply to this circular! S85  The Council could not but see in 
your resolution the proof that you had taken the side of the 
accusers, and without having waited for the Council's defence,— 
and the authorisation to send you the money in question was 
withdrawn from me. In the meantime you have received the 
Égalité with the answer of the Romance Committee, which 
represents ten times as many Swiss workers as the Jurassians. But 
the writers' malevolent intention is already apparent from the Jura 
circular. 1" First they look for an argument with us using the pretext 
of the Conference, and now they attack us because we are carrying 
out the resolutions of the Basle Congress, resolutions which we are 
obliged to carry out. They do not want the authority of the 
General Council, not even if it were to be voluntarily consented to by all 
I would really like to know how without this authority (as they call 
it) the Tolains, the Durands and the Nechayevs could have been

dealt with according to their deserts and how, with that 
fine-sounding phrase about the autonomy of the sections, as it is 
explained in the circular, they expect to prevent the intrusion of 
Mordecaians and traitors. Certainly, no one disputes the autonomy 
of the sections, but one cannot have a federation unless some 
powers are ceded to the federal committees and, in the last 
instance, to the General Council. 
But do you know who the authors and advocates of these 
authoritarian resolutions were? The delegates of the General 
Council? Not at all. These authoritarian measures were put 
forward by the Belgian delegates, and the Schwitzguébels, the 
Guillaumes, the Bakunins were their most ardent advocates That's the 
truth of the matter. 
It seems to me that the phrases 'authority' and centralisation are 
much abused. I know of nothing more authoritarian than a 
revolution, and when one imposes one's will on others with bombs 
and rifle bullets, as in every revolution,2 it seems to me one 
performs an authoritarian act. It was the lack of centralisation and 
authority that cost the life of the Paris Commune. After the 
victory make what you like of authority, etc., but for the struggle 
we need to gather all our forces into a single band and 
concentrate them on the same point of attack. And when people 
speak to me about authority and centralisation as if they were two 
things to be condemned in all possible circumstances, it seems to 
me that those who talk like this either do not know what a 
revolution is, or are revolutionaries in name only. 
If you want to know what the authors of the circular have done 
in practice for the International, read their own official report on 
the state of the Jura Federation to the Congress (Révolution sociale, 
Geneva, 23 November 1871) and you will see to what a state of 
dissolution and impotence they have reduced a federation which 
was well established a year before. And these are people who want 
to reform the International! b

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 18 January 1872 a 
Dear Liebknecht, 
The facts about the Belgians are these: De Paepe is the only one 
who is worth anything, but he is not very active. Steens is a 
jackass, a schemer and perhaps worse, and Hins is a Proudhonist 
who by that very fact, but even more because of his Russian wife, 
has leanings towards Bakunin. The others are puppets. On the 
other hand, the Belgian workers show no inclination to spark off a 
rebellion in the International. Hence the bad grace evident in the 
formulation of the resolution. 404 Fortunately, Mr Hins has been 
the victim of his own super-smartness, for the workers' papers, 
which have not been able to look behind the scenes, interpret the 
resolution literally and so read it as a declaration in our favour. E.g. 
the Tagwacht and the Emancipation in Madrid, 413 etc. 
Conference resolutionsb have no necessary binding force, since 
a conference is, in  itself,  an illegal mechanism, justified only by 
the gravity of the situation. Hence recognition is always desi­
rable. 
It would be good if you were to follow the lead of the Tagwacht 
and interpret the Belgian resolution as indicated above, adding 
that the resolution about revising the Rules amounts to a rejection 
of the Bakuninist call for an immediate congress. This is implicit 
because the revision would first have to be debated at their 
congress in June and only after that could it be brought before the 
regular congress of the International, which could not be held 
before the regular time scheduled in September. You could 
further remark that if the Belgians imagined that the General 
Council was nothing more than a correspondence bureau, they 
must have forgotten the Basle resolutions, 399 which are of an 
entirely different nature and which at all events remain in force 
until they are revoked by a regular International congress. 
Up to now we intend to convene the congress at the regular

time.  It is still early to decide on the place, but it almost certainly 
will not be Switzerland, or Germany for that matter.414 
I have received one copy of the issue of the Volksstaat with my 
article, 3 and of the next issue nothing at all Marx received the 
next, but not the one with my article! No doubt a mix-up in 
despatching them. Send me half a dozen copies of No. 3 and one of 
No. 4 by return. I need several for correspondents in Italy who can 
read German, etc. 
Warmest thanks from Marx for your discretion in sending the 
Neuer Social-Demokrat which, without preparation and before any 
counter-action had been initiated, would only have upset his wife 
unnecessarily. The Workers' Society b will reply and send its 
answer to the Volksstaat; there will be also a reply to Schneider's 
article. 415 In the meantime, I enclose an item which is unlikely to 
give the gentlemen any pleasure.416 Apropos the Workers' Society, 
there have been some funny goings-on there, too.386 Schneider 
and that asinine old scoundrel, Scherzer, thought they had got a 
majority, and together with Weber, who acted as intermediary, 
they made common cause with the dissident French and then 
proposed that the Society should resign from the International. Our 
people had become lax, had squandered their advantage and 
admitted far too much  riff-raff.  But this time things had gone too 
far. They were called out in force and the proposal was defeated 
by 27 votes to 20. A motion to expel the 20 was then tabled. The 
disorder made a vote impossible. Whereupon our people im­
mediately salvaged all the Society's property, moved to another 
pub and expelled the 20. The rebels are now out in the cold and 
don't know what to do, but they had the impertinence to send 
Scherzer as their delegate to the General Council on Tuesdayc! 
Naturally, he was not admitted. 
The alliance of the ultra-federalist French with the ultra-
centralist Germans is likewise no bad thing.417  Moreover, these 
French are already completely divided. When Vésinier was elected 
secretary, Theisz, Avrial et Co. resigned (for the second time). The 
remnant has split into two bodies, one of which is led by the nose 
by Vésinier, the other by Vermersch (of the Père Duchêne, and 
here the editor of the Qui Vive! and at present of the 
Vermersch Journal). Personally and politically, the two are equally 
disreputable and at least 3 others are more than suspected of 
being spies. The French police have so overshot the mark with

to send them off to you. 
3. You should have given us the names or addresses of the 
Italian Freethinkers at once. Everyone we have contact with in Italy 
is a Freethinker. I assume you are referring to Stefanoni in 
Florence; he is an industrialist, a Bakuninist and—the founder of 
a rival international Freethinking, socialist society.421 
There is no urgency about Marx's second anti-Proudhon 
edition.b It is much more important for Capital to appear in 
French,395 and that will not be long in coming now. Negotiations 
are pending. It would be better not to say anything about the 
second edition of Capital?96  since the remaining copies of the first 
edition have still to be disposed of and it would be better for this 
bomb to strike the Roschers, Fauchers & Co. unawares. 
Marx has said nothing to me about printing the essay on 
Proudhon from the Social-Demokrat.c If I do not write anything to 
the contrary within a day or so, go ahead and print it.

balloon goes up, we have to extricate them from the mess! 
Goegg was here a few days ago. He really has improved greatly,

The news from Spain is good as far as it concerns the Federal 
Council. There is still a lot of intrigue going on in Barcelona and 
there is a strong Bakuninist influence in the Federation, but since 
in Spain the matter will be discussed by the Congress (in April)423 
and since workers are in the majority there rather than lawyers 
and doctors, etc., I surmise that all will be well. Lafargue is 
fortunately still in Madrid; the information about the Neuer 
Social-Demokrat comes from him. b Mesa, the editor of the 
Emancipacion, is completely on our side. 
In Italy we have Cuno in Milan, a Swiss engineer who knows 
Bebel and yourself and who up to now has blocked any 
Bakuninist resolutions there—apart from that, there are either 
Bakuninists or people who hang back. It is very difficult terrain 
and gives me a fiendish amount of work.

My dear Friend, 
You will already have received the books425 listed in the

your account accordingly.3 
On the other hand I have credited you with your remittance of 
£2 8s., which I have not yet cashed. 
Hodgson's work is quite unknown to me, nor have I seen it 
advertised anywhere. However, I shall endeavour to find out 
something about it. 
Our accounts should more or less balance now. I shall be writing 
to you about the Gazette des Tribuneaux, a journal of which I do 
not think we shall have any further need; the subscription expires 
at the end of January. 
You will have received The Eastern Post journals which I 
addressed to you, as also the other printed matter which I have 
enclosed with them from time to time. 
As for the International, things are going well. B.'sb intrigues 
will not amount to anything much. That man forgets that the 
working masses cannot be led as could a little bunch of doctrinaire 
sectarians. We have had, by the bye, some most valuable 
intelligence regarding his machinations in Russia—from the 
original source, at that. They are unutterably despicable. 
Ever your obedient servant,

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 426 
IN MADRID 
London, 19 January 1872 
My dear Toole,a 
We were delighted to get your letter of the 7th. As for Morago, 
you may be sure that Bakunin is at the bottom of it. As private 
correspondents, these men are assiduous beyond  belief;  and if he 
[were] a member of the Alliance, they would certainly have 
bombarded him with letters and blandishments. At any rate, the fact 
that they have resolved to place all these questions before a Spanish 
Congress423 is a victory for ourselves, since: 
1) it is a negative, albeit indirect, reply to the demand that a 
Congress of the International be immediately convened; 
2) we have always found that, as soon as the workers 
themselves, as a body, consider these questions, their natural 
common sense and their innate feeling of solidarity invariably 
enable them speedily to smell out such personal machinations. For 
working men, the International represents a great acquisition 
which they have no intention at all of relinquishing; for the 
aforesaid doctrinaire intriguers, it represents no more than an 
arena for petty squabbles of a personal and sectarian kind. 
In our reply we shall endeavour to make the maximum use of 
your observations; however, we cannot limit ourselves to what 
might best suit the Spaniards. The sorely assailed Swiss want just 
the opposite. However, I hope that we shall be able to write in 
such a way as to satisfy all our friends on the main points. 
There have been requests from several quarters for a new 
impression of the Poverty of  Philosophy,  for which a new introduc­
tion would, of course, be required, and I hope that Moor will 
attend to this as soon as his work on the second edition of 
Capital396  is completed; if, in the meantime, Mesa were to do the 
Spanish translation, he would probably get the text of the 
introduction in good time. But I cannot promise anything; you 
can imagine the amount of unexpected work that constantly 
devolves on Moor. He has entered into an agreement with 
Lachâtre 395; the contract contained one or two quite inadmissible

clauses. No doubt Jenny or Tussy will write, either to you or to 
Laura, and enlarge on the matter. 
Now for the news. 
1) Over here the French section of  1871,338  a section which had 
never been accepted as such because of its refusal to delete utterly 
incredible things from its rules, has completely disintegrated—at 
the very moment when it was bringing out a long metaphysical 
declaration against the General Council, signed by 35 citizens.3 
The election of Vésinier as secretary has caused Theisz, Avrial & 
Co. to resign (for the second time!). The Vésinier clique next 
demanded the expulsion of Vermersch, a worthy rival to Vésinier, 
both as a private individual and as a man of politics. There 
followed another split, thus creating three rumps. This is group 
autonomy at its most extreme. 
On the other hand we have over here a French section of 60 
members,359 an Italian section and a Polish one, aside from the old 
German section.427  The calumnies in the Berlin Neuer Social-
Demokrat were the work of some of Schweitzer's hoodlums who had 
wormed their way into that section; they have just been 
expelled. b—The British Federal Council330  is now functioning and 
its propaganda is proving very successful; we are especially 
anxious to build up support outside the old semi-bourgeois 
political societies and the old  TRADES  UNIONS, which are incapable of 
seeing beyond their trades. In Manchester, Dupont has been very 
useful to us. The republican clubs of Dilke & Co. adhere to the 
International in all the larger cities, and the best elements of 
almost all those clubs belong to us, so that one fine day this 
bourgeois republican movement will escape from its bourgeois 
leaders and fall into our hands. 
I was greatly pleased by the article on the Neuer Social-Demokrat 
in the Emancipation^ I at once translated and sent it to the 
Volksstaat, Liebknecht's newspaper in Leipzig. 416 
In France Serraillier is being amazingly active. Needless to say, 
the results he has obtained are not for publication, but they are 
very good. Everywhere the sections are reforming under different 
names. One fact disclosed by this correspondence is that, in almost 
every case, the Bakuninists' correspondents are informers. In one 
town in the Midi, their member was the superintendent of police.*1

informer. As you may know, he mislaid the minutes of two 
meetings; well, all those mentioned in the said minutes have been 
taken to court, and the same intentions were harboured in regard 
to yourself.  Marchand has never been able to explain what became 
of those minutes and, though proscribed in Geneva, he was able to 
return to Bordeaux without being harassed. 
In Switzerland, not only has the Romance Committee, which 
represents at least ten times more Internationalists than the 
Jurassians, come out in favour of the General Council,3  but also 
the Tagwacht of Zurich, organ of the Internationalists of German 
Switzerland (see No. 1 of 6 January). 428 The question it puts to 
those who speak of the authoritarian power wielded by the 
General Council is as follows: 
'A dictatorship always presupposes the possession by the dictator of the material 
power that would enable him to enforce his dictatorial orders. Now, all these 
journalists would greatly oblige us if they would kindly let us know where the 
General Council keeps its arsenal of bayonets and mitrailleuses.26 Suppose, for 
example, that the Zurich section should not be in agreement with this or that 
decision of the General Council (something which has not hitherto occurred), to 
what means could the General Council have recourse in order to compel the Zurich 
section to bow to that decision? But the General Council has not even the right 
definitively to exclude any one section from the Association—at the very most it 
can suspend its functions until the next Congress, which alone can give a final 
ruling... The most divergent views, not only in regard to the future organisation of 
society, but also in regard to the steps to be taken here and now, are represented in 
the great international association. That association, at its general congresses, does 
of course debate questions of this kind, but in no article of its Rules does it lay 
down a system, an obligatory norm for the sections. There is nothing obligatory 
save the fundamental principle: The emancipation of the workers by the workers 
themselves... Thus, in the International we find represented the most opposing 
political views, from the strict centralism of the Austrian workers to the anarchic 
federalism of the Spanish confederates. These last proclaim abstention from 
elections; the German confederates make full use of their votes in every election. 
In certain countries the Internationalists support other more or less progressive 
parties, elsewhere they remain  aloof,  as a distinct party, no matter what the 
circumstances. Nowhere, however, are there monarchists amongst the Inter­
nationalists. The same thing applies to questions of social economy. Communists 
and individualists work side by side, and it may be said that all forms of socialism 
are represented in the International...b However, the International has always 
shown itself capable of closing its ranks against the outside enemy, ... it has 
succeeded in maintaining its unity in the face of the Franco-Prussian War and, 
from that war, it has emerged bigger and stronger, whereas other societies have 
been crushed by the war. To a man, the International sided with the Paris 
Commune... And does the fact that this or that group holds a different view on 
questions of detail entitle the bourgeois press to talk of splits in the International?...

represented in the International'.

You have only to read the circular from the Jura sections, protesting against this 
and that, but ending with the cry: "Long live the International Working Men's 
Association!" Is that a split? No, gentlemen, despite your efforts, the International 
will not be subject to splits, it will settle its own internal affairs and reveal itself 
more united and with its ranks more serried than ever ... the more you calumniate 
us, the more you talk of splits in our ranks, the more you attack us—the more 
shall we serry our ranks and the louder will the cry resound: Long live the 
International Working Men's Association!' 
If you can make use of this for the Emancipation, so much the 
better. 
In Germany the Volksstaat has come out with considerable force 
against the Jurassians and in favour of the General Council. 3 
Furthermore, on 7 January the Saxon Congress, with 120 dele­
gates representing 60 sections, held a private meeting (being 
forbidden by law to debate the matter publicly) at which they 
unanimously condemned the Jura circular and passed a vote of 
confidence in the General Council.418 
The Austrians and Hungarians are also unanimous in their 
support of the General Council, though prevented by persecution 
from giving public proof of same; they can hardly ever meet, and 
any meeting in the name of the International is at once prohibited 
or broken up by the police. 
In Italy no organisation so far exists. So autonomous are the 
groups that they will not or cannot unite. This is a reaction to the 
extreme and bourgeois centralism of Mazzini, who aspired to 
control everything  himself,  and very stupidly at that. By slow 
degrees enlightenment will dawn, but they will have to be allowed 
to learn from experience.

good news of her and also of the little boy.c Mrs Marx, who is with 
me at the moment, and the whole of the Marx family, SEND THEIR

Dear Cuno, 
I have just received your letter via Becker3 and see from it that 
the damned Mordecaians409 have intercepted my lengthy letter to 
you of 16 December.45 This is all the more annoying as it 
contained all the necessary information about the Bakuninist 
intrigues, and would have put you in possession of the relevant 
facts a whole month earlier. Moreover, as you are a foreigner, and 
so liable to deportation, I had requested you not to be too 
prominent in public agitation, so that you might stay where you 
are and retain your position, one which is now, unfortunately, 
quite ruined.

[Membership] cards have been abolished by the Conference 
resolution in favour of stamps and have now been replaced by the 
latter.420 The cards had been subject to much abuse over a long 
period, since everywhere a large number of blank cards had fallen 
into the hands of the police, who had made use of them for their 
own purposes. In a few days I shall send you the 100 stamps as a 
receipt for the 10 frs I have none in the house at present.— 
Nothing is known here of the old Captain with the wooden leg; he 
is not in touch with the General Council.430 
I would gladly send you the Rules309 if only I had them. They 
have been printed in French and English; a German version is due 
out any day, the Italian translation is lying in my desk ready for 
printing, but 1. we have no money to have them printed on our 
own account, and 2. in view of the general rebellion against the 
Conference and the General Council instigated by Bakunin among 
the Italians, it is highly questionable whether they would in fact 
recognise an edition revised by the General Council in accordance 
with the Conference resolutions. Before this is resolved it would in 
my view be pointless to print. In the meantime, various editions of 
the Rules have come out in Italian there, e.g. in Girgentia (put out 
by the Eguaglianza), likewise in Ravenna (by the now defunct 
Romagnolo—Lodovico Nabruzzi in Ravenna could give you infor­
mation about it), and also La Plebe of Lodi, Corso Palestro, has 
advertised some at 10c. It is true that all of these are badly and in 
part incorrectly translated and only contain the earliest Adminis­
trative Regulations, but for the time being they will have to do. 
Becker tells me that he will write to you about the Bakuninist 
intrigues, but I do not want to rely on that, so here, in  brief,  are 
the essentials. Bakunin, who up to 1868 had intrigued against the 
International, joined it after he had suffered a fiasco at the Berne 
Peace Congress481 and at once began to conspire within it against 
the General Council. Bakunin has a singular theory, a potpourri 
of Proudhonism and communism, the chief point of which is first 
of all, that he does not regard capital, and hence the class 
antagonism between capitalists and wage workers which has arisen 
through the development of society, as the main evil to be 
abolished, but instead the state. While the great mass of the 
Social-Democratic workers hold our view that state power is 
nothing more than the organisation with which the ruling 
classes—landowners and capitalists—have provided themselves in 
order to protect their social privileges, Bakunin maintains that the 
a Modern name: Agrigento. 

=====第341页=====
186. Engels to Cuno. 24 January 1872 307 
state has created capital, that the capitalist has his capital only by 
the grace of the state. And since the state is the chief evil, the state 
above all must be abolished; then capital will go to hell of  itself. 
We, on the contrary, say: Abolish capital, the appropriation of all 
the means of production by the few, and the state will fall of  itself. 
The difference is an essential one: the abolition of the state is 
nonsense without a social revolution beforehand; the abolition of 
capital is the social revolution and involves a change in the whole 
mode of production. However, since for Bakunin the state is the 
main evil, nothing must be done that can keep the state alive, i.e. 
any state, republic, monarchy, or whatever it may be. Hence, 
complete abstention from all politics. To commit a political action, 
especially to take part in an election, would be a betrayal of 
principle. The thing to do is to conduct propaganda, revile the 
state,  organise, and when all the workers are won over, that is, the 
majority, to depose the authorities, abolish the state, and replace it 
by the organisation of the International. This great act, with which 
the millennium begins, is called social liquidation. 
All this sounds extremely radical and is so simple that it can be 
learned by heart in five minutes, and that is why this Bakuninist 
theory has also rapidly found favour in Italy and Spain among the 
young lawyers, doctors, and other doctrinaires. But the mass of 
the workers will never allow themselves to be persuaded that the 
public affairs of their country are not also their own affairs; they 
are by nature political and whoever tries to convince them that 
they should leave politics alone will in the end be left in the lurch 
by them. To preach that the workers should abstain from politics 
under all circumstances means driving them into the arms of the 
priests or the bourgeois republicans. 
Now as, according to Bakunin, the International was not formed 
for political struggle but in order that it might at once replace the 
old machinery of state when social liquidation occurs, it follows 
that it must come as near as possible to the Bakuninist ideal of 
future society. In this society there will above all be no authority, 
for authority=state=evil in the absolute. (How these people 
propose to operate a factory, run a railway, or steer a ship without 
one will that decides in the last resort, without unified direction, 
they do not, of course, tell us.) The authority of the majority over 
the minority also ceases. Every individual, every community, is 
autonomous, but how a society of even two people is possible 
unless each gives up some of his autonomy, Bakunin again keeps 
to himself. 
So the International must be organised according to this pattern 

=====第342页=====
308 186. Engels to Cuno. 24 January 1872 
as well. Each section is autonomous, and in each section each 
individual. To hell with the Basle resolutions, 399 which conferred 
upon the General Council a pernicious authority demoralising 
even to  itself!  Even if this authority is voluntarily conferred, it 
must cease—precisely because it is authority. 
Here you have in brief the main points of the swindle. But who 
were the authors of the Basle resolutions? The same Mr Bakunin 
and Co.! 
When these gentlemen saw at the Basle Congress that their plan 
for transferring the General Council to Geneva, i.e. getting it in 
their hands, stood no chance of success, they adopted another 
course. They founded the Alliance de la démocratie sociale, an 
international society within the large International under the 
pretext which you now encounter in the Bakuninist Italian press, 
for example in the Proletario and the Gazzettino Rosa: the ardent 
Latin races require a more striking programme than the chilly, 
deliberate Northerners. This little plan failed owing to the 
resistance of the General Council, which naturally could not 
tolerate the existence of any separate international organisation 
within the International. Since then, the same plan has appeared 
in all manner of forms in connection with the efforts of Bakunin 
and his adherents to substitute Bakunin's programme for the 
programme of the International. On the other hand, the 
reactionaries—beginning with Jules Favre and Bismarck and 
ending with Mazzini—have always come down hard upon the 
empty and vainglorious Bakuninist phrase-mongering when they 
have been at pains to attack the International. Hence the necessity 
of my declaration of 5 December against Mazzini and Bakunin, 
which was likewise printed in the Gazzettino Rosa." 
The core of the Bakunin conspiracy consists of a few dozen 
people in the Jura, who have scarcely 200 workers behind them; 
its vanguard in Italy consists of young lawyers, doctors, and 
journalists, who now come forward everywhere as the representa­
tives of the Italian workers, with a few of the same breed in 
Barcelona and Madrid, and a few individuals here and there—in 
Lyons and Brussels. There are almost no workers among them; 
they have only one specimen here,b Robin.—The Conference 
(convened out of necessity, because a Congress had become 
impossible)2M provided them with a pretext; and since most of the 
French refugees in Switzerland sided with them—they (the

Proudhonists) had much in common with them, while personal 
motives also played a part—they launched the campaign. To be 
sure,  a dissatisfied minority and unrecognised geniuses are to be 
found everywhere within the International—and they counted on 
them, not without reason. At the present time their fighting forces 
are: 
1. Bakunin himself—the Napoleon of this campaign. 
2. The 200 Jurassians and 40-50 members of the French section 
(refugees in Geneva). 
3. In Brussels, Hins, editor of the Liberie, who does not support 
them openly, however. 
4. Here, the remnants of the Section française de 187l, 33i never 
recognised by us, which has already split into 3 mutually hostile 
parts;  then about 20 Lassalleans of the type of Mr von Schweitzer, 
expelled from the German section (for proposing resignation en 
masse from the International), 3 who, as defenders of extreme 
centralisation and strict organisation, fit marvellously into an 
alliance with the anarchists and autonomists. 
5. In Spain, a few personal friends and adherents of Bakunin, 
who have greatly influenced, at least theoretically, the workers, 
particularly in Barcelona. But, on the other hand, the Spaniards 
attach great importance to organisation, and its absence among the 
others is conspicuous to them. How much success Bakunin may 
expect here will be revealed only at the Spanish Congress in 
April,423 but as the workers will predominate at this congress, I 
have no fears about it. 
6. Lastly, in Italy, as far as I know, the Turin, Bologna, and 
Girgenti sections have voted for convening a Congress before it is 
due. 
The Bakuninist press asserts that 20 Italian sections have 
affiliated with them; I have no knowledge of them. In any event, 
the leadership is in the hands of Bakunin's friends and adherents 
almost everywhere, and they are raising a terrific hubbub. But on 
closer examination it will most likely be found that they haven't 
much of a following, since in the final analysis the overwhelming 
mass of Italian workers are still Mazzinists and will remain so as 
long as the International is identified there with abstention from 
politics. 
At any rate the situation in Italy is such that, for the present, 
the International there is dominated by Bakuninist intrigues. Nor 
does the General Council think of complaining about this; the

Italians have the right to make fools of themselves as much as they 
please, and the General Council will oppose this only in peaceable 
debates. They likewise have the right to express themselves in 
favour of a Congress in the Jurassian spirit, although it is 
extremely peculiar, to be sure, that sections that have just joined 
and can have no knowledge of anything should immediately take a 
definite stand on a question of this sort without even hearing both 
sides!  I have already given the Turin people my opinion of this 
quite frankly," and I shall do the same with other sections taking a 
similar stand. For every such statement of affiliation represents an 
indirect approval of the false accusations and lies against the 
General Council contained in the circular374; the General Council, 
incidentally, will soon issue its own circularb on this question. If 
you can prevent a similar declaration by the Milanese until this 
latter appears, you will be acting in complete accordance with our 
desires. 
The joke is that these same Turinese who have declared their 
support for the Jurassians and who therefore reproach us here 
with authoritarianism, are now suddenly demanding that the 
General Council should act in an authoritarian manner quite 
without precedent for it and take steps against their rival, the 
Federazione Operaia of Turin, and outlaw Beghelli of the 
Ficcanaso who is not even a member of the International, etc.c 
And all this before we have even had a chance to listen to what 
the Federazione Operaia might have to say on it! 
Last Mondayd  I sent you the Révolution Sociale with the Jura 
circular, e an issue of the Genevan Égalité (unfortunately I no 
longer have a single copy of the one containing the reply of the 
Genevan Comité Fédéral, 1391 which represents 20 times as many 
workers as the Jurassians), and a Volksstaat which will show you 
how people in Germany regard the matter. 8 The Saxon provincial 
assembly—120 delegates from 60 places—has declared itself 
unanimously in favour of the General Council.418—The Belgian

statements supporting us come in every day. Here in England, of 
course, all these intrigues fall upon barren soil. And the General 
Council, of course, will not call an extraordinary Congress for the 
benefit of a few intriguing and vainglorious individuals. As long as 
these gentlemen stay within legal bounds, the General Council will 
gladly allow them freedom of action, and this coalition of the most 
motley elements will soon fall apart of  itself.  But as soon as they 
undertake anything contrary to the Rules or Congress resolutions, 
the General Council will do its duty. 
If one bears in mind what a time these people choose to embark 
on their conspiracy—precisely when the International is being 
hounded everywhere—it is impossible not to think that the 
gentlemen of the international Mordecai gang are involved in the 
affair. And this is actually the case. In Béziers the Genevan 
Bakuninists have as their correspondent the Commissaire central de 
police*] Two of the chief Bakuninists, Albert Richard from Lyons 
and Blanc, b were here and told a worker, Scholl from Lyons, with 
whom they got in touch, that the only way to overthrow Thiers 
was to put Bonaparte back on the throne, and that was why they 
were travelling about at the Bonapartists' expense to carry on propa­
ganda among the émigrés on behalf of a Bonapartist  restoration !  That 
is what these gentlemen call abstention from politics! In Berlin the 
Neuer Social-Demokrat, in Bismarck's pocket, is singing the same 
tune.  For the time being I shall leave as a moot point the extent to 
which the Russian police are involved in this affair, though 
Bakunin was embroiled up to his eyes in the Nechayev business 
(he denies this, to be sure, but we have authentic Russian reports 
here,  and since Marx and I understand Russian, he cannot bluff 
us). 280 Nechayev is either a Russian agent-provocateur or, at any 
rate,  has acted like one; moreover, there are all sorts of suspicious 
characters among Bakunin's Russian friends. 
I am very sorry to hear that you have lost your job. I had 
expressly written to you saying that you should avoid anything 
that might have these consequences and that your presence in 
Milan was of much greater importance for the International than 
the minute effect that one can have by agitating in public; much 
could be done underground, etc. If I can be of any assistance with 
translations, etc., I shall do so with the greatest pleasure; just let 
me know from which languages and into which language you can 
translate and in what way I can help.

I also ask you to take care with all persons connected with 
Bakunin. It is a characteristic of all sects that they stick together 
closely and carry on intrigues. Every one of your confidences—you 
may rest assured of this—will be conveyed to Bakunin at once. 
One of his main principles is the affirmation that keeping a 
promise and other such things are nothing but bourgeois 
prejudices, which a true revolutionary should always disregard in 
the interests of the cause. In Russia he speaks of this openly, in 
Western Europe it is a secret doctrine.

ENGELS TO CARLO TERZAGHI 
IN TURIN 
[Draft]  [London, 29 January 1872] 
My dear Terzaghi, 
I wrote to you on the 15th of this month3 and I then received 
your letter dated the 15th inst.432 I communicated the contents of 
a See this volume, pp. 294-95.

187. Engels to Terzaghi. 29 January 1872 313 
your letter to the General Council, where the great activity of the 
Turin workers was recognised with pleasure. 
So far the Workers' Federation of Turin has not approached the 
General Council. If it did, the Council, after listening to both parties, 
would have to deliberate whether this federation could be 
provisionally admitted or not. I cannot promise you in advance 
that it will under no circumstances be admitted. For one thing, I 
am not the Council; then there is the Council's position, as follows. 
It is true that the Basle Congress conferred upon the General 
Council the power to refuse admission, until the next Congress, to 
any new section399; but this power has never been put into practice 
except in cases of well-proven necessity, and only after hearing the 
defence of the section in question. How can we possibly commit the 
General Council in advance, before it has heard the other party? 
You can rest assured that in any case the Council will look after 
the interests of the International. 
As for Mr Beghelli, we cannot vote for the public declaration 
you request. Beghelli does not belong to the International and he 
is outside the Council's jurisdiction, and even if this were not the 
case I do not think he is sufficiently important to be distinguished 
in this manner from other journalists hostile to the International. 
But I must tell you: we did not expect requests of this sort from 
you. You have supported the calling of a special congress374 whose 
sole aim is to accuse the General Council of authoritarianism, and 
to abolish the powers given to the General Council by the Basle 
Congress. And no sooner do you vote this support than you ask 
the General Council to perform acts ten times more authoritarian 
than any it has ever performed: you ask it to make use of these 
same powers which you have already condemned and refuse 
admission to a new section without even listening to what it has to 
say in its defence. What would your Jura friends say if we were to 
make ourselves guilty of such authoritarianism? You have certainly 
taken your decision on the basis of the Jura circular and you have, 
albeit indirectly, approved the lies and slanders it contains, without 
waiting for the reply of the General Council—you, a brand-new 
section, necessarily ignorant of the whole3 matter. You had a right 
to do this, you are an autonomous section insofar as this auto­
nomy is not limited by the laws of the International. But the Gene­
ral Council is responsible for its actions and cannot allow itself 
such liberty. 
Perhaps you will now see for yourselves that such authoritarian

powers were conferred upon the General Council not without 
reason, that they may have some use and that, instead of 
inaugurating your career as Internationalists by indirectly con­
demning a General Council quite unknown to you, and with 
decisions which only tend to sow dissension at a time when 
universal government persecutions should be pushing all true 
Internationalists into the closest union—that instead of all this you 
would have done better to suspend your judgment until you are

Dear Citizen, 
I have delayed my reply to your letter for 3 reasons. 
Firstly, overwork, since in addition to all the confusion which a 
few vain mediocrities under the control of government agents 
have stirred up in the International—my time is taken up with a 
second German edition of my book on capital,396 with a French 
edition,395 for which I have to prepare a plan after the second 
German edition, and, finally, with a Russian edition, for which I 
had to supply a number of alterations to the text.a

edition of the Rules and Administrative Regulations* is in the press 
and will soon be available for despatch from the Volksstaat at 1

Thirdly, we are busy drawing up a circular15 to be printed for 
private circulation which will give a clear account of the intrigues 
of Bakunin and his comrades, etc. As soon as it is finished and in 
print, you shall receive a copy. For the moment, I would only say 
that as regards the French, everyone worth keeping is sticking by 
us. The small separate section that was formed here has now split 
into 3 sections which are devouring each other.338

My dear Jung, 
The letters we want for the project of the circular15 are: 
1) During the sitting of the Conference0 you received a letter 
from one of the Bakuninists, I think from Joukowski, in which 
the formation of a new section of propaganda359  was announced and 
the sanction of the General Council demanded. I knew from 
Outine that you had already sent a preliminary answer, and that 
that new section was nothing but a second edition of the 'Alliance 
de la démocratie socialiste'. 
This is the first letter we want.

Council to acknowledge a 'French Section', founded under his 
auspices, at Geneva.434

Old Crémieux has been in London where he put up at the 
Golden Cross Hotel with a gentleman whom he caused to be 
entered in the hotel register as his son, but who is in reality Mr 
Truchy, a former captain on the General  Staff,  a Bonapartist in 
search of a fortune, and editor of the Liberté (Girardin's), to which 
he was appointed by Badinguet a and for which he writes military 
articles under the nam de plume of Mousselerès. 
These gentry were in London to settle some business with the 
man at Chislehurst.b  The result of the transactions was old man 
Crémieux's nomination as one of the members of the Regency of 
the Empire (in the event of Badinguet's death).

Re the Misere de la philosophie, steps will be taken soon. Marx has 
signed the contract for the French translation of Capital and it will 
soon start to appear in instalments. (Between ourselves for the time 
being). 436 As soon as some have come out, it will be the turn of the 
Misère de la philosophie. 
The Manifesto will follow, in German 189 and probably in French 
and English (having appeared in an English and a French 
periodical in New York ). 
You see that things are in full swing here. But it all makes for a 
lot of work. 
The Lassalleans here have been thrown out, as you know." If 
they go on kicking up a fuss in the Neuer Social-Demokrat, send us 
the paper when you have finished with it—it doesn't get sent to 
the Workers' Educational Society 135 anymore. The Lassallean 
gentlemen here had the impertinence to go on behaving as if they 
were 'The Society' and sent Scherzer as their delegate to the 
General Council, where he was turned back without further ado. 
You will have received the 800-odd STAMPS from Marx. You stick 
them on the top of the back of the title leaf of the Rules, of which, 
I hope, we shall soon receive the 3,000 copies, together with the 
bill? Cf. the relevant Conference resolution, which is clear 
enough. 420

Alliance, and on the General Council for its tyrannical ways, etc. 
3. After an interval, this is followed in No. 1 of 4 January 1872 
by a lengthy abusive article about the General Council, in which all 
the slanders of Schneider and Weber from the Neuer Social-
Demokrat 386 appear in translation and are accompanied by equally 
outrageous commentaries, e. g. on the Communist trial. S8 
4. This is followed in No. 3 of 18 January by a letter from 
Wilhelm Liebknecht of 28 December, in which the latter promises 
help to Stefanoni and offers to publish his contributions and to 
lend his support, without seeing it, to the programme of this 
honest society at the Saxon provincial assembly. 4 
5. This is followed in No. 4 of 25 January by another abusive 
article about the General Council in which the slanderous 
allegations about Marx by Messrs Schenck and Winand are once more 
translated from the Neuer. 415 
You can see in what fine company you have involved yourself 
with your letter-writing. Stefanoni, behind whom none other than 
Bakunin (who supplied him with all this material) is concealed, has 
just used you as a tool He has used Feuerbach in the same way, 
having published one of his letters too. Büchner, of course, is also 
conspiring with Stefanoni against us. This is what happens when 
you take up with people you do not know, when a simple enquiry, 
or even the mere mention of a name, would have sufficed for us 
to give you the necessary information and to prevent you from 
compromising yourself in this way. As things stand you have no 
option but to write Stefanoni a brief rude letter, sending him the 
relevant numbers of the Volksstaat However, since Stefanoni will 
take good care not to print your letter, you must send me a copy 
so that I can translate it and see that it appears in the Italian 
press,"  for even the Bakuninist papers are at loggerheads with 
him. However, if you wish us to continue to be able to come out 
with you and on your behalf abroad, the first precondition is that 
you do not continue to make things difficult for us by writing such 
letters to unknown people. 
The people in Spain have their hands full with their struggle 
against the government, and are much too busy to quarrel with us 
anymore.

London, 16 February 1872 
Au citoyen" J. Ph. Becker 
My dear old Comrade-in-arms, 
It gave me great pleasure to receive a letter from you once 
again after so many years. 
The business about Lessner's 10 frs has been settled.442 
Can you make any suggestions about how we might assist Cuno 
in remaining where he is, i.e. in Milan? I cannot see any way from 
here and we would certainly be glad to do all we can to keep the 
brave fellow at such an important post. These damned Italians 
make more work for me than the entire rest of the International 
put together makes for the General Council. And it is all the more 
infuriating as in all probability little will come of it as long as the 
Italian workers are content to allow a few doctrinaire journalists 
and lawyers to call the tune on their  behalf. 
Marx sent the 100 stamps à 1 silver groschen in a registered 
letter to the address indicated in Cologne, but we have not yet had 
a reply. 
Your young friend Wegmann is presumably the same person as 
the one about whom my cousin, Mrs Beust, wrote to me in 
Manchester a few years ago. I tried a great deal then to find him a 
position, even though convinced of the impossibility of doing so, 
and my efforts were indeed unsuccessful, a fact on which I 
reported to Anna Beust in detail. 45 I shall now write once more to 
Manchester on his  behalf,  but would be grateful if Wegmann

could let me know in what field he is qualified to take up a 
position. Unfortunately, I cannot really hold out any prospects of 
success. The place is crawling with young German and Swiss 
engineers who snap up any position that arises in no time at all. I 
really tried everything I knew to find something for an Alsatian 
refugee, but without success, even though the man was on the spot 
and had very good references. He finally discovered something by 
pure chance after a long period of giving lessons. 
Things are going well in Spain. The forcible measures taken 
against the International by the government have really cured 
people of abstention from politics, and Marx's son-in-law, La-
fargue, who is in Madrid, is also doing his utmost to drive the 
Bakuninist quirks out of their heads. I have no worries about 
Spain. The people we are dealing with there are workers, and 
Bakunin's few doctors and journalists in Barcelona have to mind 
their ps and qs. The Spanish Federal Council is completely on our 
side.  People in various sections have expressed very sensible views, 
and the Federal Council has released a circular (or was about to 
do so a little while ago), containing its entire correspondence with 
the General Council and then putting the question whether the 
General Council had attempted to treat them, the Spaniards, in a 
dictatorial fashion. In the meantime, the situation has changed so 
much that it looks as if open conflict is imminent in Spain, and 
this has completely cut the ground from under the feet of the 
Jurassians and their adherents. They really do have other things 
on their hands now in Spain than to make such a to-do about 
trivialities. 
Outine's letter and the Suisse radicale have arrived. We shall 
publicise the case 444 without delay.3 
Your enquiry about the letters really did slip my mind. I shall 
write to Frankel at once to find out whether he received the two 
letters, and if not I shall keep on searching. If anything has gone 
astray I shall let you know immediately. 
Marx sends greetings to you all and I do likewise.

bears is that of our Association, whether 'Intern. Democr. Assoc' 
or 'Int. Assoc, among Working Men'. As however you mention the 
Basle Congress and the Jura circular,374 it is probable that it has 
reached the correct address. 
As for its contents, I must tell you that the Pisa section, as a 
section of the International Association of Working Men, is 
absolutely unknown to us. Resolution 4 of the Basle Congress says 
that any section or society wishing to become part of the 
International is obliged to give immediate notification thereof to 
the General Council, which (Resolution 5) has the right to admit 
or refuse the affiliation of any new society or group, except for an 
appeal to Congress,445 and which admits genuine workers' and 
internationalist societies and sections as soon as it has obtained 
proof that their Rules contain nothing contrary to the General 
Rules (Resolution 14 of the Geneva Congress).446 
I am sorry that these Congress resolutions weigh so heavily 
upon the sense of autonomy of the self-styled Pisa section, which 
despite being only recently formed and not yet admitted, naturally 
knows the 'temperament of the Association' much better than 
those who have belonged to it since its inception and who drafted 
its Rules. But although you are of the opinion that this 
temperament 'excludes any principle of authority', the General 
Council must unfortunately recognise the authority of the laws of the 
International, which oblige it to carry out the resolutions of 
Congresses (including that of Basle), and not to admit sections 
whose autonomy does not permit them to recognise the authority 
of the laws that are common to the Association as a whole. 
As for the demand for an extraordinary Congress, I cannot 
submit it to the General Council unless your section is regularly 
admitted. Meanwhile I can tell you that you have the distinction of

MARX TO FERDINAND JOZEWICZ448 
IN BERLIN 
[London,] 24 February 1872 
Citizen Secretary, 
I can only write a few words today. Because of the conspiracy of 
the 'international police' with certain faux frères 2 within thev 
International, the General Council has heaped so many tasks upon 
me that I have even been compelled to put aside my theoretical 
work. So to business: 
1. A resolution of the General Council, based on the four-
month-long delay in printing the stamps (itself due to unforeseen 
obstacles in London), has set back the date by which unsold stamps 
should be returned from 1 March to 1 July. (Be kind enough to 
inform Liebknecht of this since I have no time to write to him at 
present.) 
2. As far as double payment for the stamps is concerned, you 
have only to state in your report on 1 July that such-and-such a 
proportion of the money being forwarded stems from that source. 
3. As far as the 'corresponding secretary' is concerned, the 
General Council leaves it to the Berlin section to arrange the 
matter as it thinks fit. 
4. The Berlin section falls into the category of countries where 
'legal obstacles' exist to regular organisation and in such countries 
the sections have absolute freedom to constitute themselves in a 
manner appropriate to the law of the land, without thereby 
forfeiting any right possessed by the other sections.449 
5. The next Congress will be held in September 1872. The 
General Council has not yet decided on a location for the 
gathering.450 The Social-Democratic Party would be well-advised to 
let us know without delay when they intend to hold their 
Congress. 
6. The periodic reports of the General Council have been 
replaced by its weekly reports in The Eastern  Post,  the first despatch 
of which you will receive today. 
6.b The Volksstaat is one of the organs in question. 
7. The General Council thanks the Berlin section for having 
already appointed a statistical commission.451

Hamburgers (i.e. the Committee of the Social-Democratic Party)452 
stand towards the General Council. Up to now we have not had a 
word from them. 
9. The General Council requests the Berlin section to declare its 
approval of the resolutions of the last Conference of delegates of 
the International (in London).264

MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
IN MADRID 
[London,] 28 February 1872 
My dear child, 
You may judge of the overwork—I am being bothered with 
ever since December last—from my negligence in replying to your 
own and Paul's letters. Still my heart was always with you. In fact, 
the health of poor little Schnappya occupies my thoughts more 
than everything, else, and I feel even a little angry at Paul's last 
epistle, full of interesting details as to the 'movement', but a mere 
blank in regard to that dear little sufferer.454 
In consequence of uninterrupted reading and writing, an 
inflammation of my right eye has set in since a few days, so that it 
forsakes service for the moment and obliges me to limit even this 
letter to the most necessary matter-of-fact communications. 
In the first instance, Keller is not the translator of my book.b  147 
When, at last, I had found out his whereabouts, I wrote at once.17 
In his reply, he told me that he had till then only translated about 
200 pages, and that, moreover, he could not proceed with the 
work before the month of May, being bound by contract to finish 
the translation of a medical work. This would not do for me. I 
have found in Roy, the translator of Feuerbach, a man perfectly 
suitable to my purpose. Since the end of December, he has 
received from me the corrected manuscript of the Second German 
edition 396 up to pagina 280. To-day I have written him to send at 
once to Paris what manuscript may be ready. 17 
As to the biography, I have not yet made up my mind as to 
whether it be at all opportune to publish it in connection with this 
work.455 
As to the preface for Proudhon,456  j'y penserait 
The printings Paul wants I shall send to-morrow45  and should 
have done so before, if I had found the time to look after some 
statistical facts in 'the 18. Brumaire' which, I apprehend, are not 
quite correct. 
To Liebknecht I shall write. 458

As to Lara, making him—a man who is a perfect stranger to 
our party—a contributor to our party prints, is quite out of the 
question.459 At the same time, you ought not to neglect all relations 
with his family. Under certain circumstances they might prove 
useful. 
I regret that you have written to Woodhull et C°. They are 
humbugs that compromise us. Let Paul write to Charles A. Dana, 
editor of The Sun (New York) and offer him Spanish correspon­
dence, and ask him at the same time (such things must be settled 
beforehand with the Yankees) as to the money terms. I enclose a 
few lines to Dana. 17 If he should not accept, I shall find another 
paper at New York. (The Herald or something else). 
The New Social Demokrat is the continuation of Schweitzer's 
paper 3 under another editorship. He observed still a certain 
decorum. It is now a mere police paper, Bismarck's paper for the 
Lassalleans, as he has his feudal, his liberal, his all sort of colour 
papers. 
Apropos. Misled by one of your letters I had put in the contract 
with Lachâtre 436 'somme de ... sera remise à Paris ... quinze jours après 
demande'}'  I shall write him to-morrow, that I prefer the payment 
on 1st July. In case of need, I can find the money, but I must be 
informed beforehand. 
And now, my dear child, adio, with thousand kisses for little 
Schnappy and  yourself,  and my greetings to Paul. 
Yours most devotedly

ENGELS TO LOUIS PIO 461 
IN COPENHAGEN 
[London,] 7 March 1872 
Dear Mr Pio, 
I was very pleased to receive your letter of 24 February and 
would have written to you sooner, even before receiving it, had I 
had a reliable address in Köbenhavn and had I not heard from 
Outine that you were away. The truth is that it had not escaped 
our notice that Mottershead has not attended to his duties as 

=====第364页=====

Secretary for Denmark as he should. He has neglected a number 
of tasks that he should have carried out, as the accompanying 
letter to the Danish Federal Council makes clear. In order to 
remove Mottershead from the Secretariat, it would be a good idea 
for the Danish Federal Council to write to the General Council 
(c/o John Hales, GENERAL SECRETARY, 33 Rathbone Place, W. Lon­
don),  enquiring why the correspondence was being carried on so 
negligently. The fact of the matter was that we intentionally did 
not want to have a German Secretary for Denmark; our 
Frenchmen do not write English for the most part and we did not 
know how well correspondence in French would suit you—so our 
only alternative was to choose an Englishman, since you had 
written to us in English. And among such people who did not 
hold other offices, Mottershead seemed the most suitable. How­
ever, we see that he will not do and we have to find ways in which 
to activate the correspondence, so that things do not just stagnate. 
Cohen, the previous Secretary, no longer takes an interest beyond 
his immediate comrades, the cigar-workers, and moreover, he was 
arraigned by the Belgians at the Conference of September 1871 
for his behaviour in Belgium at the time of a visitation from the 
General Council. Since then he has not appeared. 
For the time being, I shall correspond privately with you, if you 
agree, until official relations are re-established. I shall also send 
you a copy of The Eastern Post every week as it carries an official 
report on the meetings of the General Council. I have already sent 
you a copy of the issue of 24 February.3 You will, of course, write 
to me in Danish. I understand your language perfectly, since I 
have made a thorough study of Scandinavian literature, and my 
only regret is that I cannot reply to you in Danish since I have 
never had the opportunity to practise it. Perhaps that will come 
later! Apart from  myself,  Marx understands Danish, but I doubt if 
anyone else does on the General Council. 
I shall do my best to send you a report for publication in the 
Socialisten from time to time, and you should indeed receive one 
today or tomorrow,b if at all possible. I am unfortunately so 
preoccupied at the moment with my secretarial duties for Italy 
and Spain and with other tasks that I have hardly any time. Until 
I can find correspondents in Spain and Italy for you, I shall keep 
you supplied with news and newspapers from both countries. The 
best solution would be for you to exchange the Socialisten for

papers from there—although there is the problem of cost, since 
their papers are weeklies and yours appears daily. 
You will have heard in Geneva and Leipzig of the attempt made 
by some dissidents, led by Bakunin, to convene an extraordinary 
Congress in order to arraign the General Council.374 The crux of 
the business concerns the International's stance on politics. These 
gentlemen call for a complete abstention from all political activity, and 
especially from all elections, whereas, right from the start, the 
International has written on its banner the conquest of political 
power by the working class as a means to social emancipation,3 and 
the General Council has defended this position. Resolution IX of 
the Conferenceb sparked off the dispute,325 but since the 
Conference resolutions have no binding force on issues of 
principle until they are endorsed by the federations, it is vital to 
have a decision of the Danish Federal Council endorsing this one. 
I shall say nothing on the substance of the matter, as this would 
be insulting to a nation so highly developed politically as the 
Danes. 
By the way, recognition of the Conference resolutions has 
already come in from the majority, that is to say from Zurich, 
from Romance Switzerland, from Germany, England, Holland and 
America. In Spain the congress due to meet in April will 
decide423; in Italy they are all still at sixes and sevens; the Belgians 
have made no comment up to now; in France the individual 
sections have all given their approval—a federation there is out of 
the question. 
Incidentally, the attempts of the Jura people to force through 
an extraordinary Congress failed spectacularly, and have been 
abandoned by them in an autographed circular (of 3 March).463  In 
favour of their proposal were: one section in Spain (Palma, 
Majorca), one in Italy (Turin, which has now reversed its decision), 
and a number of supposed sections which in fact have neither 
applied for membership of the International, nor paid any 
subscriptions (Pisa, Bologna, etc.); in London a supposed Section 
française de 1871, which however has never been admitted because 
its local Rules are incompatible with the General Rules, and which 
has since split into four parts 338—and that was all. In the 
meantime, the General Council has produced a reply to these 
a K. Marx, 'Inaugural Address of the Working Men's International Associa­
tion'. - b  K. Marx and F. Engels, 'Resolutions of the Conference of Delegates of the 
International Working Men's Association Assembled at London from 17th to 23rd

intrigues,3  which is now in the press and which I shall send you as 
soon as it is ready. 
I am sending you today through the post: 
1 copy of the Emancipation from Madrid, 
1 English and 1 French copy of the Conference resolutions; 
1 English and 1 German copy of the new edition of the Rules.b 
For the time being I shall send you the Emancipation along with 
The Eastern Post every week, and shall write to Madrid and Italy 
that they should send papers to you. If, when the Socialisten 
reappears, you can send me 4-6 copies of any interesting issues 
from time to time, I shall distribute them until you have made 
firm arrangements of your own. 
Since I know that Mottershead has neither proposed that the 
Danish Federal Council should recognise the Conference resolu­
tions,  nor taken any action to implement the decision about the 
adhesive membership stamps, I am taking it upon myself to put 
these matters before the Danish Federal Council through you. As 
for the stamps (Conference Resolution IV,  1-5), 420 they were not 
ready until much later than expected and so the settlement date 
has been postponed by a decision of the General Council from 
1 March (IV, 4) to 1 July. I am sending you 500 stamps for the 
present. They cost £2.1/10 and I would be obliged if you could let 
me know whether you need any more and how many. This 
information should best go to Mottershead (33 Rathbone Place) or 
to Hales. 
We are keenly awaiting the results of your Rigsdag elections464— 
we think it of very great importance that workers from the 
International should sit in all the parliaments and that Bebel, who 
up to now has alone had this honour, should receive some 
support, no matter where. We believe that you in Denmark have 
good prospects of getting people in and hope that you are 
successful. 
Salut et fraternité.

to imagine that  the  General Council just conjures  up everything 
out of a hat,  whereas  the  contrary  is the  case: without  the  private 
contributions  of its  members  and  their personal friends, absolutely 
nothing could  be done.  I notice  the  same comments  in letters from 
Speyer, Boite  and yourself,  as I do in  correspondence from other 
countries. Every country believes that  our  entire time  can be 
devoted  to it  alone.  If we  wanted  to grumble about every single 
detail,  we  could,  e.g.,  complain that your REPORTS  to us  appear 
simultaneously  in the  Volksstaat. 
Since  I was  commissioned  by the  General Council  at long last  to 
report  on the  SPLIT  in America422  (the  matter  had had to be 
postponed from  one  meeting  to the  next  on account  of the  chaos 
within  the  International  in  Europe)—I have carefully gone 
through  all the  correspondence from  New  York together with 
everything that appeared  in the  papers  and  have discovered that 
we were  by no  means duly informed  in time about  the  elements 
that brought about  the  breach.  A portion  of the  resolutions  I have 
proposed3  has  already been accepted,  the  rest will  be passed next 
Tuesday0  and the  final judgment will then  be sent  off to New 
York. 
You will receive  1,000  copies  of the  German Rules. Hales will

Eccarius says that  the  things were sent  to Gregory467  (his  private 
correspondent) because  you had  written  to him  that  you  were 
resigning from office  but had not  named  a new  correspondent. 
The complaint about  the  French having their  'own'  correspon­
dent is quite unjust,468 since  the  Germans also  had one of  their 
own and Eccarius, the  SECRETARY  for the  UNITED STATES,  can certainly 
deal with correspondence  in German  and  English,  but not in 
French. Moreover,  the  complaint  was  politically ill-advised, since  it 
seemed  to justify  the  view  of the  French members  of the  COUNCIL 
that Section  I aspired  to dictatorial authority over  the  other 
sections.354  It arrived here  at the  same time  as the  complaint from 
the COUNTER-COMMITTEE that Section  I was  represented  on the old 
committee  in numbers exceeding those stipulated  by the  Rules. 
The cost  of the  Rules  was  higher  for the  COUNTER-COMMITTEE 
because import duties  had to be  paid  (at  least, that  is what they 
maintain).

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 381 
IN MADRID 
London, 11 March 1872 
My dear Lafargue, 
If you wish to entrust me with your affairs, I shall be glad to 
look after them; all you have to do is write and ask your agent to 
send me your share certificates and bonds by registered letter 
addressed to me at 122 Regent's Park Road. These I would keep 
along with my own. As to the coupons, dividends and interest, I 
shan't be able to tell you anything until I have examined the 
documents, but that can be arranged without difficulty. In the case 
of ready cash I believe you would do better to have it remitted to 
Madrid by bill of exchange and deposit it with a banker down 
there; I feel sure there must be some to whom you can entrust it. 
If, however, you would rather have it sent to me, I would ask you 
to give formal instructions that this should be in the form of a bill 
of exchange (or mandate) on London made out to my order—again 
by registered letter. In either case the bill of exchange should be 
short-dated. Or again, you could split the amount and instruct your 
agent to send part to Madrid and the remainder to me. Whichever 
you wish. It is always much better to send a bill of exchange than 
banknotes. You will lose equally one way or the other, but 
probably less with a bill of exchange. Besides, in the event of theft 
a banknote is lost for good, whereas a bill of exchange" is difficult 
for a thief to cash and in such a case one can prevent payment. 
There is always a certain risk, even with registered letters, when 
they pass from one country to the other, but I know of no other 
means of ensuring that your share certificates, etc., reach me. 
Besides, we have recently had a great deal of experience with 
registered letters, since those that are unregistered do not always 
arrive, while registered letters have hitherto arrived without 
exception.b 
I have sent you a number of papers from here, for instance on 
February 14th four cuttings from The Eastern Post, the Volksstaat, 
the Tagwacht of Zurich, and the Socialiste of New York;

good deal more practical than they appear in their papers, and I 
perfectly understand the reason why. I am quite certain for 
instance that when they demand, that on the morrow of important 
events the land and the instruments of labour should be at once 
handed over to those who ought to hold them, they know 
perfectly well this to be impracticable, but must make the demand 
for consistency's sake. We must make a full allowance for their 
position. The Bakunist rubbish cannot be cleared away in one day, 
it is quite enough that the process of clearing it out has at last 
begun in good earnest. 
From the Jurassian last circular you will have seen what a 
complete fiasco that ludicrous campaign has ended in.463 However, 
the circular of the General Council in replyb is being printed and 
you may as well prepare our friends there for the fact that these 
men will be very roughly handled by us, and that all the facts we 
know about them—they are scandalous enough—will be laid 
before the Association. We must now make an end of this sect. 
Mohr's and my time has been wasted entirely by them for months 
past and this cannot go on. Only yesterday I had to send to Naples 
a complete pamphlet of twelve closely written pages in refutation 
of their absurdities.45  They are all Bakunists in Naples, and there 
is only one amongst them, Cafiero, who at least is de bonne volonté, 0 
with him I correspond. About other matters I write to your wife.d 
Mrs Engels e sends her compliments to both of you. 
Yours truly,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 381 
IN MADRID 
London, 11 March 1872 
Dear Laura, 
I should like to compliment you on Paul's articles in the 
Emancipation, which have given us all great pleasure, sending as 
they do a breath of fresh air into the desert of abstract 
declamation that prevails amongst the Spaniards.3  Given all the 
tribulations and journeyings which have been inflicted on you over 
the past eighteen months and which, needless to say, I have 
followed with interest and at times with anxiety, it must be very 
gratifying for you to know that Paul's presence in Madrid, 
precisely at the decisive moment, has been of incalculable value 
both to us and to the whole Association. Had Bakunin & Co. won 
the day in Spain—and without Paul they would probably have 
done so—a split would have occurred and with it a public 
rumpus. But now this attempted rebellion has come to an 
ignominious end and we can proclaim a victoire sur toute la lignée 
In those articles in the Emancipation where, for the first time, the 
Spaniards were treated to some genuine learning, you yourself 
played an important part, indeed the really learned part, which 
means that I, as Secretary for Spain, owe you especial thanks. 
I see from the Naples Campana that Paul has also extended his 
activities in that direction. So much the better. Naples harbours 
the worst Bakuninists in the whole of Italy. Cafiero is a good chap, 
a born intermediary and, as such, naturally weak. If he doesn't 
improve soon, I shall give him up too. In Italy the journalists, 
lawyers and doctors have thrust themselves so much to the fore 
that up till now we have been unable to get in direct touch with 
the workers. That is beginning to change and we are discovering 
that the workers, as everywhere else, are quite different from their 
spokesmen. It is ludicrous—these people cry 'we want complete 
autonomy, we don't want leaders' and at the same time, more than 
a This presumably refers to: [P. Lafargue,] 'El apölogo de San Simon', 'El 
reinado de la burguesia', 'Las panaceas de la burguesia', 'Organizaciön del trabajo', 
La Emancipation, Nos. 29, 32-38; 1, 21, 28 January, 4, 11, 18, 25 February, 
3 March 1872. - b victory all along the line

in any other country, they allow a handful of doctrinaire 
bourgeois to lead them by the nose. The Spaniards are much 
better in this respect, for on the whole they have progressed a 
good deal further than the aforesaid Italians. 
There have been great rejoicings at your home since the 
Longuet affair and if, at the time of your engagement, one or two 
people may have cracked bad jokes about  CASTING  SHEEFS  EYES,  you 
have now been fully avenged, for Jenny is doing her very best 
along similar lines. This business has, by the way, been of 
enormous benefit to her; she is happy and cheerful and also 
physically much better, while Longuet is a very kindly companion. 
Tussy is also very pleased about the affair and really gives the 
impression that she  SHOULD  NOT MIND TO  FOLLOW  SUIT.  Day after 
tomorrow Longuet will give a guest performance at your house 
where he will cook sole à la normande, his national dish. We too 
have been invited and I shall be curious to see what my wife a 
makes of the taste. His last offering— boeuf à la  mode —WAS  NO GREAT 
SUCCESS. 
The Fondevilles have ruined themselves utterly over here, 
morally speaking; they are out and out tricksters. 
My best thanks for that amusing Spanish poem.469 It has caused 
us a great deal of merriment. 
I'm glad that Schnappyb is improving and hope soon to hear 
that he is perfectly well again. The poor little chap has already 
had a great deal to contend with. 
So now good-bye, think kind thoughts of me and rest assured 
that, wherever you may go, my heartfelt interest will go with you. 
My wife, though still unknown to you, sends her best wishes. 
Ever your old

ENGELS TO LOUIS PIO 
IN COPENHAGEN 
[London, mid-March 1872] 
Dear Mr Pio, 
I think I cannot give you anything better for my first 
correspondence than the preceding translation of two excellent 
articles from the Pensamento Social.3 I have not the slightest idea 
who may be the author, but they show an insight into the 
economical and historical conditions of the development of 
modern society which I am astonished to find in a paper coming 
from so remote a corner of the world. 
By the bye, the article on organisation of agricultural production 
by Association from Socialisten which I got inserted in the 
published report of the Meetings of the General Council, has gone 
the round of the Spanish, Italian and American press, and I now 
find it reproduced in the Pensamento Social470; it has created great 
sensation and will not be without its fruit. Altogether, with regard 
to the all-important question of enlisting the small peasantry and 
Husmaendenab  in the proletarian movement, the Danes, owing to 
their local circumstances and to their great political intelligence, 
are now in advance of all other nations. I have told Liebknecht 
and others this, but unfortunately they are too lazy to learn 
Danish. 
Mottershead0 has not attended the last three meetings of the 
General Council, but he intends, so he has told us, to resign from 
his office as Secretary for Denmark; he says he is too busy to carry 
out his duties as Secretary. 
In the meantime, I beg you to be so kind as to correspond with 
me, and I take upon myself all responsibility for any repercussions 
which might affect you vis-à-vis the General Council because of it. 
We intend to transfer the secretaryship for Denmark to a 
Frenchman, a member of the Commune de Paris. 6

IN HOBOKEN 
[London,] 15 March 1872 
33 Rathbone Place, W. C. 
(new address of the General Council)3 
Dear Citizen, 
I enclose the Resolutions of the General Council (in English and 
Frenchb). The other Council422  will receive them from Le Moussu. 
Eccarius, at the end of the sitting of 12 March, told rhe privately 
that he would not send the Resolutions to New York and that, at 
next sitting, he would tender his resignation as Secretary for the 
United States. As this affair cannot be settled by the General 
Council before Tuesday next,c  the Resolutions sent by me and Le 
Moussu, are not signed by a Secretary, the which, considering the 
form chosen, was not necessary. They will be printed in next 
week's Eastern Post. 
During the discussion Eccarius spoke in a spirit most hostile to 
your Council. He spoke and voted against Resolution III, 2.471 He 
was moreover offended because, in order to save time, I had not 
submitted the Resolutions to the subcommittee435 of which he 
forms part, but laid them at once before the General Council. As 
the latter fully approved this proceeding, after my statement of 
a Marx added this on the letterhead of the General Council. - b K. Marx,

the reasons which had induced me to act as I have done, Eccarius 
ought to have dropped his personal spleen. 
For the private information of your Council I add that M. and 
Madame Huleck—he is an imbecile and she is 'une intrigante de bas 
état' 3—had for a moment slipped into the General Council at a 
time when most of us were absent, but that, soon after, this worthy 
couple was forced to withdraw consequent upon their intrigues 
with the soi-disant Branche Française* the which was excluded from 
the International and denounced by us, in the Marseillaise and the 
Réveil, on the eve of the plebiscite, 104 as 'une section policière'." 50 
Moreover, these two persons, after their arrival at New York, 
cooperated in the foundation of a Society hostile to the 
International and were in constant connection with les beaux restes 
de la branche française 6 at London. The same facts have been 
communicated by Le Moussu to the other Council. 
Section 10 (French) has written an excellent letter to the General 
Council on the American split.472

If there  are not  enough copies available,  may I ask you to  send

for the  Latin countries  of Europe  as a  counter  to the  nonsense 
purveyed  by  Bakunin,  as  well  as the  ubiquitous Proudhonist 
rubbish. 
As soon  as we  have time, Marx  and I, we  shall prepare  a new 
edition  of the  Manifesto with  an  introduction,189  etc., but at the

the owners  are  sure  to be  most unwilling  to lose  the 10  guineas 
rent,  and  since  we  shall  sue for  DAMAGES  and  shall  get  them  too, it is 
obvious that they  are  being compensated  by the  government. 
Meanwhile  we  shall chance  it and  just  go along quietly  and if we 
find the  door locked, which  is probable,  but not  certain,  we  shall

MARX TO MAURICE LACHATRE 474 
IN SAN SEBASTIAN 
London, 18 March 1872 
To Citizen Maurice La Châtre 
Dear Citizen, 
I applaud your idea of publishing the translation of Das Kapital 
in periodic instalments. In this form the work will be more 
accessible to the working class and for me that consideration 
outweighs any other. 
That is the bright side of your medal, but here is the reverse. 
The method of analysis I have used, a method not previously 
applied to economic subjects, makes for somewhat arduous 
reading in the early chapters, and it is to be feared that the 
French public, ever impatient to arrive at conclusions and eager to 
know how the general principles relate to the immediate questions 
that excite them, may become discouraged because they will not 
have been able to carry straight on. 
That is a disadvantage about which I can do nothing other than 
constantly caution and forewarn those readers concerned with the 
truth. There is no royal road to learning and the only people with 
any chance of scaling its sunlit peaks are those who have no fear 
of weariness when ascending the precipitous paths that lead up to 
them. 
I remain, dear Citizen, 
Yours very sincerely,

ENGELS TO CESARE BERT 475 
IN TURIN 
[Draft] 
London, 21 March 1872 
Citizen Carlo Bert, 
I have received your address from Citizen Et. Péchard, who was 
passing through Turin at the end of February, and also the 
information that you are now the secretary of our section 
Emancipation of the Proletarian, instead of C. Terzaghi, who was 
expelled for embezzlement, etc. It will therefore now be my pleasant 
duty to correspond with you. 
I have just received a long letter from Terzaghia saying that he 
resigned as secretary and member of the Emancipation of the 
Proletarian because this society is made up in part of government 
agents and Mazzinians, and that this society wanted to pass a vote 
of no confidence in him because he was preaching war on capital 
Naturally, we here are much more inclined to believe what you 
and the other members of your Council told Péchard than what I 
hear from Terzaghi, who has always played all sorts of tricks on 
us. But in order to be able to act confidently and decisively and to 
fulfil our responsibility at the next Congress, we should like you to 
send us an official letter from your Council, setting out the 
charges against Terzaghi and letting us know the resolutions 
passed by your society concerning him. In no way can we have two 
rival, warring sections in the same town. Fortunately, the 
Administrative Regulations (Resolutions of the Basle Congress) 
give the General Council the right to admit or reject any new 
section. 476 You yourself see how necessary it is for our organisation 
to possess a right which Terzaghi's Jurassian friends wanted you to 
believe was authoritarian and unjustifiable. 
Please reply as quickly as possible. A fraternal handshake. 
Yours

212 
MARX TO PAUL LAFARGUE477 
IN MADRID 
London, 21 March 1872 
My dear Toole,a 
Enclosed herewith an extract from our missive against the 
dissidents'3 concerning the functions of the General Council. 
All the General Council can do when applying the General 
Rules and the resolutions of Congresses to given cases is to take 
decisions as a tribunal. But their implementation in each country 
depends entirely on the International  itself.  Thus from the 
moment at which the Council ceases to function as the instrument of 
the general interests of the International, it becomes wholly invalid 
and powerless. On the other hand, the General Council itself is 
one of the Association's vital forces, being essential for the latter's 
unity and for preventing the Association from being taken over by 
hostile elements. The moral influence that the present Council 
(NOTWITHSTANDING  ALL  ITS SHORTCOMINGS)  has been able to acquire vis-à-vis 
the common enemy, has wounded the vanity of those who saw the 
International as nothing save an instrument for their personal 
ambition. 
Above all it should not be forgotten that our Association is the 
militant organisation of the proletariat and in no way a society 
created to bring amateur doctrinaires to the forefront. To destroy 
our organisation just now would be to abdicate. Bourgeois and 
governments combined could ask for nothing more. Read the 
report of the Rural Sacasec on the Dufaure plan.478 What does he 
most admire and fear about the Association? 'Its organisation.' 
We have made marvellous progress since the London Confer­
ence. 254 New federations have been set up in Denmark, New 
Zealand and Portugal, great expansion in the United States, in 
France (where, by their own admission, Malon & Co. do not 
possess one single section), in Germany, in Hungary, in England 
(since the formation of the British Federal Council). The Irish 
sections are of very recent formation. In Italy the only serious

sections, in Milan and Turin, are ours; the others are led by 
lawyers, journalists and other bourgeois doctrinaires. (Apropos, one 
of Bakunin's personal grounds for complaint against me is that he 
has lost all influence in Russia where the revolutionary youth tread 
the same path as myself.) 
The Resolutions of the London Conference3 have already been 
recognised by France, America, England, Ireland, Denmark, 
Holland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland (minus the 
Jurassians), the genuine working men's sections in Italy and, 
finally, the Russians and Poles. Those who fail to recognise them 
will do nothing to alter this fact, but will be forced to part 
company with the vast majority of the International. 
I am overburdened with work, so much so that I haven't even 
found time to write to my SWEET Kakadoub and DEAR Schnappy0 (of 
whom I should like to have further news). Indeed, the Interna­
tional impinges too greatly on my time and, were it not my 
conviction that my presence on the Council is still necessary at this 
period of strife, I should have withdrawn long since. 
The English government prevented our celebration of 
18 March, the resolutions concerning which, adopted at a meeting 
of English working men and French refugees, are enclosed 
herewith.473 
La Châtre is an abominable charlatan. He wastes my time over 
the most absurd matters (e.g. his letter replying to my autograph, 0 
in which regard I was compelled to propose certain alterations to 
him). 
Roy (6, Rue [de] Condillac, Bordeaux) is a marvellous trans­
lator. 479 He has already sent me the manuscript of the first chapter

in Paris).396

[Appendix] 48° 
Extract 
The Council's Right of Co-option 
'The body of the General Council is constantly changing, though 
some of the founding members remain, as in the Belgian, 
Romance, etc., Federal Councils. 
'The General Council must fulfil three essential conditions, if it 
is to carry out its mandate. In the first place, it must have a 
numerically adequate membership to carry on its diverse func­
tions;  secondly, a membership of working men belonging to the 
different nationalities represented in the International Association; 
and, lastly, workers must be the predominant element therein. 
Since the exigencies of the worker's job incessantly cause changes 
in the membership of the General Council, how can it fulfil all 
these indispensable conditions without the right of co-option?' 
[Note: More than 3/4 of the members of the General Council in 
London are wage labourers.] 
Functions of the General Council 
'Contrary to the rules of all bourgeois societies, the Internation­
al's General Rules touch only lighdy on its administrative 
organisation. They leave its development to practice, and its 
régularisation to future Congresses. Nevertheless, inasmuch as 
only the unity and joint action of the sections of the various 
countries could give them a genuinely international character, the 
Rules pay more attention to the General Council than to the other 
bodies of the organisation. 
'Article 5 of the original Rules' (Article 6 of the revised Rules3) 
'states: 
' "The General Council shall form an international agency 
between the different national and local groups" ' 
(There follow examples of its activities: information, statistics to 
be compiled, etc., and also this important passage, falsified by the 
Jurassians: 
'when immediate practical steps should be  needed,  as, for instance, in 
case of international1" quarrels, the action of all the societies be 
simultaneous and uniform'.) 
a K. Marx, General Rules and Administrative Regulations of the International 
Working Men's Association. - b In the original: 'national'. 

=====第383页=====
212. Marx to Paul Lafargue. 21 March 1872 349 
The same article states : 
'Whenever it seems opportune, the General Council shall take 
the initiative of  proposals  to be laid before the different national or 
local societies.' 
The General Rules charge the General Council with working out 
certain matters to be submitted to the Congress, etc. (see articles 4 
and 6 of the revised edition). 'In the original Rules so little 
distinction is made between the spontaneous action of various 
groups and unity of action of the Association as a whole, that 
Article 6' (Article 7 of the revised Rules) 'states:' (see this article). 
'The first administrative resolution of the Geneva Congress' 
(1866) '(Article I) says: 
' "The General Council is commissioned to carry the resolutions of the Congress 
into effect" 
'This resolution legalised the position that the General Council 
has held ever since its origin: that of the Association's executive 
delegation. 
'The Geneva Congress at the same time charged the General 
Council with publishing "the official and obligatory text of the 
Rules".'  (See the revised Rules, Appendix I, pp. 16, 17.) 
'The same Congress resolved (Administrative Resolutions of 
Geneva, Article 14): 
' "Every section has the right to draw up its own rules and regulations adapted 
to local conditions and to the laws of its own country, but they must not contain 
anything contrary to the General Rules and Regulations." 
'Who is to establish whether' the required conformity actually 
exists? 'Evidently, if there would be no authority charged with this 
function, the resolution would be null and void. Not only could 
police or hostile sections be formed, but also the intrusion of 
declassed sectarians and bourgeois philanthropists into the Associ­
ation could warp its character and, by force of numbers at 
Congresses, crush the workers. Since their origin, the national and 
local federations have exercised in their respective countries the 
right to admit or reject new sections, according to whether or not 
their Rules conformed to the General Rules.' As to the General 
Council, the exercise of this function 'is provided for in Article 6 
of the General Rules' (end of Article 7, revised Rules), 'which 
allows local independent societies (i.e. societies formed outside the 
federal body) the right to establish direct contacts with the General 
Council.' Since the foundation of the International such local 
independent societies have only been recognised after being 
admitted by the General Council.

=====第384页=====
350 212. Marx to Paul Lafargue. 21 March 1872 
The same 'Article 6 of the Rules' (Article 7 of the revised Rules) 
'deals with legal obstacles to the formation of national federations 
in certain countries where', by force of circumstances, 'the General 
Council is asked to function as a Federal Council (see Le Congrès de 
Lausanne, Procès-verbaux, p. 13, 1867). 
'Since the fall of the Commune, these legal obstacles have been 
multiplying in the various countries, making action by the General 
Council therein, designed to keep doubtful elements out of the 
Association, more necessary than ever. Thus, for instance, the 
French committees recently demanded the General Council's 
intervention to rid themselves of informers, and in another great 
country' [between you and me: Austria] 'members of the 
International requested it not to recognise any section which has 
not been formed by its direct mandatory or by themselves.' They 
are seeking, in this way, to rid 'themselves of agents-provocateurs, 
whose burning zeal manifested itself in the rapid formation of 
sections of unparalleled radicalism.' 
[Note: Needless to say, in countries like Poland and Russia 
members of the International can only maintain links with the 
General Council, which must act with the utmost discretion there.] 
'Like all the International's groups, the General Council is 
required to carry on propaganda. This it has accomplished 
through its' publications, through its correspondence with indi­
viduals in countries where the Association has not yet been 
established, and through 'its agents, who laid the basis for the first 
organisations of the International in North America, in Germany 
and in many French towns' [ditto in Australia, in New Zealand]. 
'Another function of the General Council is to aid strikers and 
organise their support by the entire International. See General 
Council reports to the various Congresses. The following fact, inter 
alia, indicates the importance of its intervention in the strike 
movement. The Resistance Society of the English Foundrymen is 
in itself an international "Trades Union" with branches in other 
countries, notably in the United States. Nonetheless, during a 
strike of American foundrymen, the latter found it necessary to 
invoke the intercession of the General Council to prevent English 
foundrymen being brought into America.' 
[Note: The only real international Trades Union in Europe is that 
of the cigar-men (cigar-makers). However, they stay entirely 
outside the proletarian movement and only have recourse to the 
General Council to further the interests of their trade.] 
'The growth of the International obliged the General Council 
and all Federal Councils to assume the role of arbiter.'

212.  Marx to Paul Lafargue. 21 March 1872 351 
Without the General Council having asked for it, 'the Brussels 
Congress' (1868) 'resolved that: 
' "The Federal Councils shall transmit to the General Council every three 
months a report on the administration and financial state of their respective 
branches" ' (see Procès-verbaux du troisième Congrès etc.) '(Administrative Resolution 
No. 3). 
'Lastly, the Basle Congress occupied itself solely with regulating 
the administrative relations engendered by the Association's 
continuing development'  itself.  'If it extended unduly the limits of 
the General Council's powers, whose fault was it if not that of 
Bakunin, Schwitzguébel, Fritz Robert, Guillaume and other 
delegates of the Alliance' of Socialist Democracy, 'who were so 
anxious to achieve just that?' [Note: At the Basle Congress these 
gentlemen imagined that the Council would be transferred to 
Geneva.] 
'Here are two resolutions of the Basle Congress: 
' "No. IV. Each new section or society which is formed and wishes to be part of 
the International, must immediately announce its adhesion to the General 
Council", 
'and "No. V. The General Council has the right to admit or reject the 
affiliation of any new society or group, subject to appeal at the next Congress."' 
It is these resolutions that 'authorise the General Council to 
intervene in the internal affairs of the federations.' However, these 
articles have never been applied except in the case of sections placed 
outside federal associations or sections formed in countries where the 
International does not yet exist In these cases intervention by the 
Council is absolutely essential. On the other hand, the General 
Council has never 'intervened in the' internal 'affairs of new sections 
desirous of affiliating themselves with' already 'existing groups or 
federations.' 
'The resolutions cited above' only 'refer to sections in the  process  of 
formation. The resolutions given below refer to sections already 
recognised : 
' "VI. The General Council has equally the right to suspend' (see the following 
Note) 'until the next Congress any section of the International." 
' "VII. When conflicts arise between the societies or branches of a national 
group, or between groups of different nationalities, the General Council shall have 
the right to decide the conflict, subject to appeal at the next Congress which will 
decide definitely." 
'These two articles are necessary for extreme cases, although up 
to the present the General Council has never had recourse to 
them. It has never suspended any section and, in cases of conflict, 
has only acted as arbiter at the request of the two' sections.

[Note: From the enclosed resolutions on the split in America 3 
you will see that the Council has suspended one section composed 
almost exclusively of bourgeois. In the United States the intrusion 
of bourgeois seeking to turn the International into their instru­
ment is very dangerous. This proves the necessity of Resolution 
VI of the Basle Congress.] 
Apart from the various functions devolving upon the General 
Council as a result of the historical development of the Interna­
tional, there is yet another one, imposed on it by the enemies of 
our Association. By making the Council the object of their attacks, 
all the parties and sects hostile to the proletarian movement have 
'placed it in the vanguard of the International Working Men's 
Association'.

ENGELS TO CARLO TERZAGHI 
IN TURIN 
[Draft] 
London, 21 [March] 1872 
Dear Citizen, 
I wrote to you on the 13th of this month45  and later received 
your letter of the 10th. Péchard was told in Turin 481 that you had 
been expelled from the Emancipation of the Proletarian society for 
various reasons: that you refused to hand over a certain sum 
belonging to the Society as well as the 200 stamps which I sent 
you, etc., etc. 
When such accusations are made, it is absolutely essential that 
the General Council should know whether or not they are true, 
before it can declare itself for one side or the other. I should be 
grateful, therefore, if you would tell me what is going on, because

it is certain that such matters cannot be passed over in silence. 
As for the contribution of 150 frs,a this money did not belong to 
the General Council but to a private Committee formed to collect 
funds with which to support the friendly press and other 
international causes, and since your sudden and enthusiastic 
declaration in favour of the Jura was such as to lead the 
Committee to believe that you had taken sides in a cause whose 
very foundations were necessarily unknown to you, the money was 
immediately spent on another purpose, and there are no more 
funds available at present. 
I have not received II Proletario, which you promised to send me 
regularly, for the last 6 weeks. 
We have changed the address of the Council meetings. I cannot 
at present give you another personal address, but I believe the one 
you have, C. R.,b 122 Regent's Park Road, is still better than that 
of the General Council. 
I think Savio is no longer in London but has gone to work in 
the provinces.482

To Citizen Gennaro Bovio, Trani4SS 
Esteemed Citizen, 
I have received, and am returning with thanks, the various 
documents which you were so kind as to send me through esteemed 
Citizen Enrico Bignami. 
The General Council of the International, as an administrative 
committee with clearly defined functions, has not been able to 
become acquainted with these documents and discuss them 
officially. I did, however, consider it my duty to submit them to 
those of its members who understand Italian, and they have all 
read them with great pleasure. 
We are happy to acknowledge that, at the same time as an 
international league of workers was being formed here in London, 
you, in far-off Apulia, had the same idea and bravely promoted it 
at the Naples Congress.484 We are grateful to you for informing us 
of this: it is fresh proof that the alliance of workers of the civilised 
world was already recognised in 1864 as a historical necessity, even 
in countries with which we were unable to establish contacts at that 
time,  not knowing whom to address.' And we sincerely regret that

the Italian workers' societies, not having taken up your idea in 
1864,  have greatly delayed the development of the proletarian 
movement in Italy. 
It gave us great pleasure to read your articles in the Liberia 
defending the Paris Commune against V. Hugo and others3; we 
willingly believe that they were the first articles to be written with 
this purpose in Italian. We published here at the same time the 
manifesto of the General Council on The Civil War in France, of 
which I have taken the liberty of sending you, on 23 March, a 
copy in English and one in German, since I do not have the 
French translation and the Italian one (in the Eguaglianza of 
Girgentib) has not yet been completed. You will see from this 
pamphlet that our ideas coincide on this matter too, and that we 
have not failed in our duty either.

that time, an Italian working-class movement based on the social conditions of their 
country, fewer workers' societies in Italy today would be advocating sectarian 
doctrines which, moreover, are not Italian but French or Russian. I further believe 
that in the working-class movement true national ideas, i.e. ideas corresponding to 
the economic realities, both in industry and in agriculture, to the realities that are 
dominant in the country in question, are, at the same time, true international ideas.

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 150 
IN DÜSSELDORF 
London, 22[-23] April 1872 
Dear Cuno, 
This morning I received your letter,3 which I had awaited with 
anxiety. Gandolfi wrote me some time agob  saying it was believed 
that the Italian government had handed you over to the 
Prussians.—I found out about your arrest, etc., from the papers, 
which indicated that you were being deported for 'lack of visible 
means of support'. A police statement to that effect appeared in a 
Milan newspaper. This affair is not without significance. It is the 
first exploit of the international police conspiracy organised by 
Prussia, Austria, and Italy, and if you haven't been transported by 
the police from the Bavarian frontier to Düsseldorf, you owe this 
solely to the stupidity of the Bavarians. Tomorrow evening I shall 
report the matter to the General Council, after which the whole 
story will be included in the official report, which will be printed 
in The Eastern Post and sent out to every part in the world. c In the 
meantime, write an article about this in your own name and send 
it to the Volksstaat, the Geneva Égalité, and the Gazzettino Rosa. We 
shall take care of here, America, and Spain, as well as of France, 
over here. 485 The rascals will finally have to realise that they 
cannot keep on doing this with impunity and that the Inter­
national's arms are longer than those of the King of Italy.d As 
soon as the story is printed I shall send you a copy, together with 
all the newspapers I can collect for you—they won't be too 
numerous. 
The advice Liebknecht gave you—to write to Bismarck—is very 
good, but for altogether different reasons. First, instead of 
assisting you to obtain redress, Bismarck will be very glad it 
happened and will merely be irritated that the Bavarians released 
you, instead of realising that this gave them a splendid opportuni­
ty for having a member of the International transported all over 
Germany by the police. But you should write to Bismarck simply 
a Cuno's letter of 17 April 1872 - b on 14 March - c  F. Engels, 'On the Police 
Persecution of the Member of the International Theodore Cuno'. - d Victor

in order to be able to send his reply—which will be nothing but a 
lame excuse, of course—at a later date to Bebel, who will use it to 
raise a row in the Reichstag. But it is out of the question, of course, 
that Bismarck will do as much as lift a finger to punish Italy for 
having fulfilled his orders so well. 
You must not be surprised that you have received so little 
support from the party comrades. From one of your previous 
letters I had already realised that you laboured under youthful 
illusions concerning the aid people receive when in need. 
Unfortunately, my answer to this letter was confiscated by the 
Mordecaians 09 and never reached you. I should add that, 
although our German workers have far outstripped all the others 
as concerns theory, in practice they have by no means shaken off 
their artisan-type mentality, and owing to the dreadfully petty-
bourgeois character of life in Germany, they are tremendously 
narrow-minded, especially in money matters. That is why I wasn't 
at all surprised at what you experienced in this respect. If I had 
money, I should send you some, but we here are really on the 
rocks just now. We have more than a hundred helpless refugees 
of the Paris Commune, literally helpless, for no people ever feel as 
helpless abroad as do the French; and what they didn't eat up, we 
sent to a fine chapa in Cork, Ireland, who founded the 
International there and was rewarded by being excommunicated 
by the priests and the bourgeoisie and completely ruined. We are 
in a tight spot at the moment. If we get some money from 
somewhere or other, I shall see to it that you are not forgot­
ten. 
Let me know in what branches of your profession you have had 
practical experience and in general what you can do. I shall look 
around immediately to see if anything can be found for you here. 
England is overrun by foreign engineers, it is true, but perhaps 
something can still be done. I have some very good contacts. 
During your imprisonment all sorts of things have happened. In 
Turin Terzaghi was sacked from the Emancipazione del Proletario 
for embezzlement and suspicious dealings with the Questore.h He 
still managed to publish 2-3 issues of the Proletario in which he 
attacks them as canaglia, borghesi, vigliacchi,c etc.—just as he earlier 
attacked the Federazione Operaia—but the paper now appears to be 
dead, just like almost all the little new papers in Italy—Martello, 
Campana, etc. I wrote to Terzaghi,d asking him about these

accusations, and he sent me a copy of the Proletario full of abuse, 
saying that I could see from that what a lot of scoundrels they 
were! I had had my suspicions about the man for months. Regis 
(who visited you under the name of Péchard, and who is in 
Geneva at present) found out that he was constandy going to 
Locarno to see Bakunin, and it is a good thing that he now stands 
exposed as a plain rascal. 
In Bologna the Fascio Operaio486 of the Romagna has held a 
congress in the course of which they threw off their masks and 
emerged as outright Bakuninists.487 The Romagnese are joining 
the International, but won't hear a word about the need to 
recognise the Rules, etc. They have not yet written to us, although 
the congress took place on 18 March; we shall give them a jolly 
reception!—The Ravenna section has written to us announcing 
that they intend to join but salva la propria autonomic.3 I have 
simply asked them whether they accept our Rules or not.488 
I have just been looking at a heap of papers that has been sent 
to me and see that Pezza and Testini have also been arrested in 
Milan (around 30 March). 
The circular of the General Council on Bakunin and Co.b is in 
the press and will probably be ready by the end of next week. I 
shall send you a copy without delay. It sets forth everything quite 
blundy, and it will produce a terrific row. 
I believe I'll be able to send you newspapers tomorrow— 
Gazzettino Rosa and some other Italian items, in general, anything 
I can lay my hands upon. 
A congress of the Spanish members of the International was 
held in Saragossa on 8-11 April, at which our people won a victory 
over the Bakuninists. 489 It now turns out that the Alliance de la 
démocratie socialiste 10 continued to exist in Spain within the 
International as a  secret society  under the leadership of Bakunin—a 
secret society aimed, not against the government, but against the 
mass of the workers! I have every reason to suspect that the same 
thing is going on in Italy. What information do you have on this 
subject? 
If anything comes of the job in Spain that Becker 0 had in mind 
for you, let me know at once so that I can give you letters of 
introduction to our people there. That job will probably be in 
Catalonia, the only industrial province of Spain, and you will be 
able to do very useful work, since the mass of workers there are 
a reserving their autonomy - b  K. Marx and F. Engels, Fictitious Splits in the

admittedly good but leave their newspaper (La Federation in 
Barcelona) and the key positions in the hands of the Bakuninists. 
There is only one newspaper appearing in Turin now— 
L'Anticristo,  something of the order of a weekly Gazzettino Rosa. 
Then there are La Plebe in Lodi, II Fascio Operaio in Bologna, and 
L'Eguaglianza in Girgenti3—all the other Italian newspapers are 
dead. Experience in other countries made it obvious to me long 
ago that this was bound to happen. It is not enough to have a few 
people at the top; the masses in Italy are still too backward to be 
able to support so many newspapers. Prolonged and dogged work, 
with more theoretical content than the Bakuninists possess, is 
required to free the masses from the influence of the Mazzinist 
nonsense. 
Many thanks for the Milan address. Would it not be a good idea 
for you to write first and ask the man b to send you a report on the 
present position of the International in Milan? You could then 
send it to me and I would reply to him. The present 
corresponding secretary is Mauro Gandolfi, i.e. one of Bakunin's 
supporters. 
Write to me very soon—especially on what you are able to do in 
your profession, so that I can take the necessary steps. 
Cordially yours, 
F. E. 
The address you have been using to write to me (that of your 
Düsseldorf letter) is by far the best.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 23 April 1872 
Dear Liebknecht, 
We all send you our congratulations on your performance in 
court.274 After the trial of the Brunswickers335 it was essential for 
someone to stand up to that gang and you have fairly done so. 
The only thing you might have left unsaid was the statement 
about the 1,000 members of the International.490 
Here in England jurymen are locked up overnight or kept 
prisoner under guard in an hotel, to make sure that they do not 
come into contact with anyone. They are taken for walks under 
escort and are also escorted to church on Sundays, if they wish to 
go. An exception is only made in cases like the Tichborne trial,491 
where this was not possible because of the inordinate duration of 
the proceedings (105 days), but even then the jurymen are 
harassed in all sorts of ways. 
Marx will reply to the Concordia492 as soon as he has compared 
The Times of 1864.a 
Your letter appeared in The Eastern Posth; whether it also 
appeared in The Morning Post is not to be discovered, since the 
paper is unobtainable here. The fact is that reading rooms where 
such things would be preserved, have simply  ceased  to exist. We send 
The Eastern Post regularly to the ends of the earth so that the 
letter will be publicised far more widely—and among the right 
people—than through other papers. 
We can scarcely doubt that the sentence must be quashed. Such 
breaches of the law have been unheard of since the Demagogue 
trials. 116 Nor can it be to the advantage of the national-liberal 
bourgeoisie to establish such precedents, and I doubt very much 
whether Bismarck, who is hiding behind the small states with the 
intention of discrediting them, would be willing to risk that sort of 
thing in Prussia. 
I have seen very little about the trial in the English press—I 
have so many foreign papers to read that I can only read The

Daily News and you must realise that since the introduction of the 
PENNY PRESS 493 it is not possible to find papers anywhere to read 
without buying them. The article from The Daily News* is 
enclosed; you can make good use of it. 
I have.passed the bill for the Rules'5 on to Marx; we shall send 
the money at the first opportunity. 
I have not been able to get hold of a photograph of Blanqui up 
to now. The French have one but will not part with it, and there is 
none to be found here. 
Enclosed the receipt for the 6 reichsthalers for the refugees. 
It is just not possible for us to conjure up an introduction to the 
Manifesto out of a hat for you.494 We shall have to study the 
socialist literature of the last 24 years, if we are to bring 
Section III up to date. This must be postponed for a subsequent 
edition, but we intend to send you a small 'Preface"" for the 
separate edition, and that will suffice for the moment. 
What Scheu d has to say about the Belgians is partly correct; the 
fellows have never been worth much and are now worth less than 
ever. We have sent someone over there who will let us have a 
detailed report shortly. At all events Scheu's deductions are wide 
of the mark—the mass of the people will never go so far with 
Messrs Hins (who through his Russian wife has a certain 
connection with Bakunin) and Steens (whose vanity is great 
enough to seduce him into foolish adventures). Particularly since 
we are making very good progress elsewhere in the world. Our 
people have defeated the Bakuninists at the Spanish Congress in 
Saragossa. 489 
As for Cuno, he has behaved extremely well in Milan and what 
he tells me in his letters about his fate is completely true and has 
been confirmed by the Italian press.e But it seems quite 
undeniable to me that, on his journeyings, having been shown the 
door for the sake of the International through no fault of his own 
and having landed in Bavaria, helpless and penniless, he has since 
been treated very uncouthly indeed by the people he has 
encountered in various places. He may have had rather 
dewy-eyed ideas about the help he might look forward to, but 
your money would be better spent if it were reserved for people 
such as him, instead of its being squandered on tramps and rogues

read out at the trial (and which have unfortunately not appeared

Cuno was not one of the full-fledged men of the 'Party' and so 
had no business getting into trouble! If I had money I would

Dear Eccarius, 
You seem to have lost your wits and as I regard this as a passing 
phase, at least for the present, perhaps you will allow me to 
address you for the time being as neither SIR, nor Herr nor 
Domine, and also to write to you in German instead of English. 
If you haven't lost your memory along with your command of 
the German language—and if you have, the MINUTES of the 
General Council can jog it—you will recollect that all the quarrels 
I have had with the English since the founding of the Internation­
al up to the last conference3 have been due simply and solely to 
the fact that I always took your side. Firstly, on the subject of The 
Commonwealth, against Odger, Cremer, Howell, etc.; secondly, 
against Fox, with whom I had been on very friendly terms497; and 
lastly, against Hales during the period when you were General 
Secretary. 
If conflicts occurred later on, it would be important to establish 
who was responsible for them. I have only attacked you twice. 
Firstly, on account of the premature publication of the Confer­
ence resolutions, in which, as you are well aware, you exceeded 
your  brief.498 
Secondly, because of the last skirmish with America where you 
caused great MISCHIEF. (I am leaving out of account here the fact 
that your actions brought such abuse from the AMERICAN PAPERS, 
aided and abetted by Karl Heinzen et Co., down on my head; I 
am just as impervious to this abuse as I had previously been to 
praise, both public and private, from the same source.) 
You appear to imagine, however, that when you make BLUNDERS 
others must pay you compliments in return, instead of telling you 
the truth as one would to anyone else. I shall give you back 
Gregory's stuff tomorrow evening.499 Today I have to go through 
the French and German proofsb simultaneously, so have no time 
to look through the American papers.

As for my 'INDICTMENT', I shall simply confine myself to proving 
that 1. you were absolutely in the wrong to write to New York in 
the way that you wrote, at such a decisive moment, even supposing 
that your GRIEVANCES were justified, and 2. that your complaint 
about the suppression of papers vis-à-vis the General Council is 
absolutely without foundation. Voilà tout* 
Finally, let me give you some good advice. You must not think 
that old personal and party friends are or will be less well disposed 
towards you just because they see it as their duty to oppose your 
FREAKS. On the other hand, you should not imagine that the small 
clique of Englishmen who make use of you for certain purposes 
are your friends. I could prove the contrary if I wished. 
And so salut Since it is my birthday the day after tomorrow I 
have absolutely no desire to celebrate it in the unpleasant 
conviction that I have lost one of my oldest friends and 
like-minded comrades. 
Salut fraternel, 
Karl Marx

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 7 May 1872 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I see now where your mistrust of Cuno stems from: you thought 
he was an agent of Becker'sb who had come on a mission to lead 
the German International back into the arms of its mother-section 
in Geneva.c This was quite unnecessary. When Cuno was in 
Chemnitz,d he could have been enrolled as a member there and 
then,  if you had not treated the International so platonically. In 
a That's all. - b  Johann Philipp Becker - c See this volume, pp. 370-72. - d Modern 
name: Karl-Marx-Stadt.

Milan, since he did not have our address, he turned to the only 
one known to him, that of Becker, and Becker, having admitted 
him, directed him to us. So just because Becker had once 
experienced the desire to annex Germany for  himself,  and 
because he may still intrigue a little here and there, you have to 
suspect every honest fellow who has had to turn to Becker because 
you were unwilling to act! I shall not believe your allegations about 
his boastfulness until I see  proof;  I have far less confidence in 
your correspondents in Nuremberg and elsewhere than I have in 
Cuno,  who has never tried to pull the wool over our eyes, but has 
always reported more truthfully than most other people. Cuno's 
father is a Prussian official in Düsseldorf who simply threw him 
out; now he is stuck without a penny to his name. His possessions 
and those of his father are two different things altogether. 
Enclosed an article by Lafargue from the Emancipation; you will 
have someone or other who knows enough Spanish to translate 
it.600 Lafargue is doing a terrific amount of work in Spain and very 
skilfully too. The report from the Liberie on the congress in 
Saragossa was also by him. Incidentally, do not forget to publish the 
second report, the one in the previous issue of the 'Liberté', in which he 
unmasks the secret intrigues of the Bakuninists and describes the 
spectacular victory gained over them by our supporters there. 501 
This was the decisive defeat for that pig-headed Bakunin. The 
Emancipation is now the best paper we have. These Bakuninists 
are jackasses. The Spaniards have a very good organisation, one 
which has stood the test with flying colours precisely in the last 6 
months, and now these fools come along and imagine that they 
can seduce people with their phrases about autonomy and get 
them to dissolve their organisation to all intents and purposes. 
You ought to make more use of The Eastern Post; the 
information we make available there is truly of greater interest 
than the dogmatic legalistic waffle of Mr Acollas about the best of 
all possible constitutions.502 
I still believe that the conviction will be quashed. In the first 
place, too many formal errors have been made, and secondly, the 
trial has already caused far too much of a rumpus.274 Bismarck 
must surely perceive that he has gone too far and that quashing 
the sentence will be more advantageous for him than confirming 
it.

unfortunately your letter arrived in Italy at the very moment when 
all our papers I had sent it to folded up simultaneously. As for 
Büchner, you only need glance at his last would-be socialist 
production to see the envy and hatred the little cripple feels for 
Marx, whom he plunders and distorts without ever mentioning 
him by name. 3 And I stick to my belief that it is he who has filled 
Stefanoni's head with all that junk. That he is on good terms with 
you is something he shares with Malon and many others who 
cherish a mortal hatred for us. 
I am sending you today's Daily News with a delightful account 
of the behaviour of the German professors and students in Alsace 
and the reception given them by the Alsatians. A description of 
the German student is enclosed.b Both reports are by Major 
Forbes, the same man who was with the Saxons before Paris and 
was, at the time, beside himself with admiration for the German 
officers and soldiers, i.e. if anything he is prejudiced in favour of 
the Germans. You should make use of these descriptions of the 
representatives of 'German culture'; they are striking proof as to 
how threadbare that 'culture' of the bourgeoisie has become, and 
how ludicrous its official spokesmen.503 
As soon as I have time I shall write you an article on the 
housing shortage and against the absurd Proudhonist stories that 
have appeared in a series of articles on the subject in the 
Volksstaat 504 
Our reply to the Jurassiansc is still in the press. The devil take 
all these co-operative printers. 
There is nothing to tell you about the Congress. Where it will 
take place can only be decided at the last moment.450 That it will 
take place, you know already. 
The arrest of our people in Denmark will be of enormous 
advantage to us and will not do much harm to the victims.505 
Denmark is not Saxony. Unfortunately, I do not know who has 
been arrested and so am forced to interrupt the correspondence. 
The Emancipation now regularly publishes extracts from the 
Volksstaat. Laura is looking after it, so make sure that the paper is 
sent there regularly.

rack and ruin; the two decent people we have there do not have

sufficient energy to intervene. The workers in the provinces are 
much superior, but Brussels is the rottenest soil of all and as long 
as the centre is there it is unlikely that anything decent can 
develop. Hins has gone off to Verviers and since then the Liberté 
is much more accessible, so that is a positive gain. 
Give our best wishes to your wifea  and Bebel. You will have 
heard that Jenny Marx is engaged to Longuet. The first 
instalments of the 2nd edition of Capital 145 are due in the next few 
days and so is the French edition.436 We have already seen the

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 150 
IN SERAING 
[London,] 7[-8] May 1872 
Dear Cuno, 
It is very good that you are writing to Bismarck about your 
case—this should be done, if only to induce him to compromise 
himself and thus afford Bebel an occasion to address the 
Reichstag.b—By now you will have received The Eastern Post with 
the report on the General Council meeting at which I talked about 
your casec; I sent that issue off on the 2nd inst. You have 
probably also received the newspapers sent you on 24 and 
27 April. I also reported on the arson plot, but this is very badly

stated in the report, which I am sending you tomorrow, as is 
usually the case when I don't write these things  myself. 506 
I have written off to a friend in Manchester4 on your  behalf,  a 
cotton-spinner who will certainly do his best for you. Unfortunate­
ly, he only spends 2 days a week in Manchester now as, for the 
next 4 weeks or so, he has to spend the rest of his time in his 
father's factory in the country. He will therefore not be able to do 
very much for you until he has returned for good. And as 
misfortune would have it, another friend, a  CONSULTING  ENGINEER  who 
has a lot of connections, happens to have just left for a two-month 
trip to Germany. So if I have nothing positive to tell you at the 
moment, you must put it down to these circumstances. 
The secret society of the Bakuninists in Spain is a fully 
established fact; you will be able to read the details in the report 
(the second one) on the Saragossa Congress in the Brussels Liberté, 
which you will probably find in the Volksstaat in the next few 
days. 501 Luckily enough, the best of the people in it soon realised 
that the interests of this secret enterprise and the interests of the 
International were not at all identical, and as the International was 
dearer to them than everything else, they immediately shifted 
their stand and remained in the secret society solely in order to 
check on it and to paralyse its activity. One of thema was here as a 
delegate to the Conference11 and saw for himself that everything 
they had told him down there about the intrigues, dictatorship, 
etc., of the General Council was empty twaddle. A short time later 
one of our best men—half Frenchman, half Spaniard0 —came to 
Madrid, and this settled the matter. The Spaniards have an 
excellent organisation, of which they are rightly proud, and, as it 
happens, it has shown itself in the best light during the past 6 
months. And now along come these jackasses from Bakunin's 
Alliance to the Saragossa Congress 423 and demand that they 
should kill off the entire organisation and render it impotent 
simply for the sake of the 'autonomy of the sections'! All the 
criticism the Jura camels made of the General Council, all the 
demands which they put to the General Council—the cancellation 
of all the powers transferred to it, the demotion of the General 
Council to the level of a mere correspondence bureau—all this 
was applied in Spain to the Spanish Federal Council. Of course, 
the Spanish workers simply laughed these doctrinaires out of court 
and in one voice bid them to be silent. This is the severest blow

Bakunin has received up to now—he was undoubtedly counting 
on Spain—and there cannot fail to be repercussions in Italy. 
I do not doubt for an instant that the same secret society exists 
in Italy, though, perhaps, not in as rigid a form as in formalistic 
Spain. The best proof of this for me is the almost military 
precision with which the very same slogan, issued from above, was 
simultaneously proclaimed in every corner of the country. (Note 
that these are the very same persons who always preach the 
principle dal basso  all' alto" to the people, and to the International!) 
It is only too easy to understand that you were not initiated, for 
even among the Bakuninists only the leaders are admitted to this 
esoteric society. Meanwhile, some individual symptoms of improve­
ment can be observed in Italy. The Ferrarese have acquiesced; 
they have recognised the Rules and Administrative Regulations 
and have sent their own Rules here for our approval, b something 
which explicitly goes against the Bakuninist slogan.507 The damned 
difficulty in Italy is simply getting into direct contact with the 
workers. These damned Bakuninist doctrinaire lawyers, doctors, 
etc., have penetrated everywhere and behave as if they were the 
hereditary representatives of the workers. Wherever we have been 
able to break through this line of skirmishers and get in touch 
with the masses themselves, everything is all right and soon 
mended, but it is almost impossible to do this anywhere due to a 
lack of addresses. That is why it would have been of great value 
for you to have remained in Milan and to have been able to visit 
various cities from time to time—if not now, then at any rate later 
on. With one or two able comrades at the key points we should 
have managed to deal with all this rabble in 6 months or so. 
As for the Spanish police, all I can tell you is that apparently 
they are frightfully stupid and that there is no unity at all among 
them. For instance, one of our best men in Madrid0 was ordered 
to be deported by the Minister of the Interior,d but the Governor 
of Madrid said quod non,e and he remained there undisturbed. 
8 May. After writing this much I have now received your letter 
from Seraing. I cannot understand the business with the Prussian 
police.508 The police could not do anything at all to you unless you 
had given them an excuse for legal proceedings, something you 
will doubtless have taken good care not to do. Could your Papa 
have staged such a comedy in order to rid himself of an 
inconvenient son?

At all events, I enclose 50 francs in banknotes, serial numbers 
below. I have no addresses in Seraing, but shall write at once to 
César De Paepe, Hôpital St Jean, Brussels (he is a member of the 
Belgian Federal Council) and ask him to send you some. I shall 
also write to Alfred Herman, 57 Mont St Martin, Liège (though 
whether he is still in Liège I do not know). If you do not hear 
soon from De Paepe, write to him, mentioning my name. If you 
go to Liège, look Herman up. I enclose a few lines to him, 45 he 
will be able to give you everything—it is better than my writing to 
him through the post, he may no longer be there—you are quite 
close to Liège after all. An unrequested letter opened by the post 
might betray you. 
As for Becker,3 I shall clear up the somewhat comic mystery in 
my next letter. Until then, 
Sincerely yours, 
F. E. 
The letter to Herman should only be given to him personally. He 
also lives with reactionary parents and brothers and sisters. 
8 May, evening. As I had to go into town to get the enclosed 
Banque de France fifty-franc note (dated 11 October 1871, 
No. 2 648 626, in the upper left corner—626, in the upper right 
corner—Z 106), and it was too late to send this letter off by 
registered mail, which had to be done because of the money, I still 
have time to tell you the story about Becker, which is another 
instance of what petty intrigues go to make up world history. For 
a long time old man Becker has retained his own ideas of 
organisation, dating from the epoch before 1848: little groups, 
whose leaders keep in touch in a more or less organised way to 
give the whole movement a common thrust, a little conspiratorial 
activity on occasion, and the like; and then another idea, likewise 
dating from that period, is that the central executive organ of the 
German organisation must be located outside Germany. When the 
International was founded, and Becker took over the organisation 
of the Germans in Switzerland and other countries, he established 
a section in Geneva, which was gradually converted into the 
'Mother Section of the Group of German-Language Sections' by 
organising new sections in Switzerland, Germany, etc. It then 
began to claim the top leadership, not only of the Germans living 
in Switzerland, America, France, etc., but also of the Germans in 
a Johann Philipp Becker 

=====第405页=====
220.  Engels to Cuno. 7-8 May 1872 371 
Germany and Austria. This was all the old method of revolution­
ary agitation employed up to '48, and as long as it was based 
upon the voluntary subordination of the sections, there could be 
no objection to it. But there was one thing the good soul Becker* 
forgot: that the entire organisation of the International was too 
big for such methods and purposes. Becker and his friends, 
however, accomplished something and always remained direct and 
avowed sections of the International. 
In the meantime the labour movement in Germany was 
growing, freeing itself from the fetters of Lassalleanism, and, 
under the leadership of Bebel and Liebknecht, it came out for the 
International in principle. The movement became too powerful 
and acquired too much independent significance for it to be able 
to acknowledge the leadership of the Geneva Mother Section; the 
German workers held their own congresses and elected their own 
executive organs. The relationship of the German workers' party 
to the International never was made clear, however. This 
relationship remained a purely platonic one; there was no actual 
membership for individuals (with some exceptions), while the 
formation of sections was forbidden by law. As a result, the 
following situation developed in Germany: They claimed the rights 
of membership, while they brushed aside its obligations, and only 
after the London Conference did we insist that henceforth they 
would have to comply with their obligations as well. 
Now you will understand that there not only had to arise a 
certain rivalry between the leaders in Germany, on the one hand, 
and the Geneva Mother Section, on the other, but that individual 
conflicts also became unavoidable, especially over the payment of 
dues.  The extent to which the General Council has been 
authoritarian in this affair, as in every other, you can see from the 
fact that it has been completely uninterested in the matter and has 
left both sides entirely to themselves. Each is right in some 
respects and wrong in others. From the very start Becker has 
attached great importance to the International, but has wanted to 
cast it in the long-obsolete mould. Liebknecht, etc., are in the right 
insofar as the German workers want to rule themselves, and not 
be controlled by an obscure council in Geneva; but in the last 
analysis they have sought to subordinate the International to their 
own, specifically German, aims and to make it serve them. The 
General Council would intervene solely at the request of both sides 
or in the event of a serious conflict. 
Liebknecht evidently took you to be an agent of Becker's, 
travelling on behalf of the Geneva Mother Section, and this

explains all the mistrust with which it seems he received you. He is 
also a man of '48 and attaches more importance to such trifles 
than they deserve. You may be glad that you did not live through 
this period—I have in mind not the first revolutionary wave from 
February to the June battle509 (that was splendid), but the 
democratic bourgeois intrigues, beginning with June 1848, and the 
ensuing emigration of  1849-51.  At the present time the movement 
is infinitely greater. 
This,  I trust, will explain the reception you got in Leipzig. No 
special importance should be attached to such trifles—they are all 
things that are overcome by themselves in time. When you meet the 
Belgian members of the International, you will, perhaps, again 
be disappointed. Above all, don't entertain too great illusions 
about these people. They are very good elements, but the cause 
has, by and large, run along in a worn-out rut, and phrases are 
more important to them than the cause  itself.  The big words 
autonomie and autoritarisme can attract a large audience in 
Belgium as well. Eh bien, vous verrez pour vous-même*

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 
IN GENEVA 
London, 9 May 1872 
Dear Becker, 
Your suggestion of Geneva as a location for the Congress has 
much in its favour and has much support here, but naturally 
nothing can be decided at the moment since the position can alter 
from day to day.480 In the meantime, we must know, if we are to 
be able to make a final decision, what the situation is like there 
and whether it will be possible for you to be assured of a compact 
and reliable majority of the Swiss delegates. The Alliance people 10

will use all the old tricks at their disposal to gain the majority for 
themselves, just as in Basle; the Jurassians will make sure that 
imaginary sections secure representation. Apart from Turin, the 
Italians will send nothing but friends of Bakunin—even Milan 
where, since Cuno's expulsion, 3 they once again have the upper 
hand. The Spaniards will be divided, though it is not yet possible 
to say in what proportions. Germany will be weakly represented as 
usual, the same applies to England; for France there will only be a 
few refugees from there and perhaps some from here; the 
Belgians are highly unreliable so that very great efforts will have 
to be made to secure a respectable majority. For a slight majority is 
as bad as none at all, and the squabbling would just start up all 
over again. So let us know what the situation is with you and in 
German Switzerland, and speak quite frankly so that we do not 
miscalculate. 
Cuno has also had to flee from Düsseldorf with the police after 
him and he is now in Seraing near Liège. 
Wegmann is in Manchester, but since he delayed so long the 
situation has changed, business is worse and work is hard to come 
by. However, I shall see to it that he gets something soon. Best 
wishes from Marx. 
Yours very truly,

information from other sources and. as far as Hins is concerned, it

is agreeable to learn that his preference for the Neuer" not only 
makes itself felt in the Liberie but is also expressed directly. In 
this Hins, as a Bakuninist thanks to his wife, is quite consistent. 
It is good that all the scoundrels should meet up with each 
other. 
I passed on the relevant information to Eccarius, who replied: 
Tell Liebknecht that I shall discuss corresponding with him again 
once he has answered my letter of last July.—What Sorge writes to 
you 511 is at present the subject of charges levelled at Eccarius, who 
has lost much ground here thanks to his repeated indiscretions. 
It goes without saying that nothing can be decided at present 
about the location of the Congress.45 
I am delighted to hear that the Volksstaat is selling so well. 512 As 
soon as time permits I shall contribute articles more frequently, 
but you can have no idea how hard-pressed we are, because Marx, 
myself and 1 or 2 others have to do absolutely everything. 
We shall attend to the Preface for the Manifestoh at the first 
possible opportunity.494 Marx has a terrific amount of work to do 
on the French translation0; much has to be altered in the opening 
part.436 And then he has also to read the proofs of the 2nd 
German edition.396 
The article on the housing shortage0 will be done today or 
tomorrow. 
The Fédération Jurassienne publishes a swinish little paper: 
Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne, subscription obtainable from 
Adhémar Schwitzguébel, Sonvillier, Jura Bernois, 4 frs per 
annum, 2 frs a half-year. You should take it and hit them hard 
from time to time, it is Bakunin's Moniteur. In the last issue 
Lafargue, who is in Madrid under an assumed name, was directly 
denounced to the Spanish police. 513 
Enclosed is a cutting from The Eastern Postil4 —you will probably 
be sent the first edition, in which, thanks to Hales' indolence, the 
most important things are missing, as usual. If that is the case, 
drop me a couple of lines for the PUBLISHER SO that he can send you 
the second edition. Otherwise you will still be in the dark. What I 
said about the Saragossa Congress is accurate enough, but 
Lafargue forgot to tell us that at the same time a resolution had 
been passed recognising and adopting the resolutions of the 
Belgian Congress (of 25 December 1871). 404 So that the victory was

by no means as complete as he described it to  us. 489 I am awaiting 
further details about this last resolution. 
That the Alliance10 has survived as a secret society, in Spain at 
least, is proved and recognised. Our own people were in it, 
because they knew no better and thought they had to be. This is a 
very serious matter for Mr Bakunin. 
Don't forget to publish Lafargue's 2nd report on the Saragossa 
Congress from the Liberté. 501 It has put the Jurassians into a fury 
and their last issue contains a public attack on Lafargue,  myself, 
Marx and Serraillier. But they are as quiet as mice on the subject 
of the revelations about their secret  society.  This is the tell-tale point 
and so we must noise it abroad as much as possible. I am 
convinced that this secret organisation of the Alliance has branches 
in Switzerland and in Italy too. It will not be easy to obtain  proof, 
however.—The next issue.of Egalité will include a statement by 
Lafargue against the Jurassians. 3

on housing. Your Proudhonistb will be satisfied with it. 
I shall write to Wigand about my Condition of the Working-
Class.515 But there can be no question at all of my attending to it 
before the Congress is over; my hands are full until then. 
The Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher are unobtainable, except, 
perhaps, second-hand; that should be perfectly clear to you. The 
same goes for the Misere de la philosophie (although Vieweg in 
Paris,  Frank's successor, may still have a few). A collection of 
essays is an old plan of ours but it also needs time. Mr Knapp will 
find sufficient instruction in Capital; once he has digested that he 
will doubtless know whether he is on our side or not, and if he still 
does not know, not even Moses and all the Prophets will be able to 
do anything for him. The crux of the matter is to be found in 
Chapters II and III of Capital and he should know where he 
stands on that before calling for further nourishment.

What view does the 'Committee' in Hamburg452 take of the 
International? We must now try and clear up the situation there as 
quickly as possible so that Germany can be properly represented at 
the Congress.450 I must ask you straight out to tell us frankly how 
the International stands with you. 
1. Roughly how many stamps have been distributed to how 
many places, and which places are involved? The 208 counted by 
Fink51 are surely not all there are? 
2. Does the Social-Democratic Workers' Party intend to be 
represented at the Congress and  IF SO how does it propose to place 
itself en règle' with the General Council in advance so that its 
mandate cannot be queried at the Congress? This would mean 
a) that it would have to declare itself to be the German Federation 
of the International in reality and not merely figuratively and 
b) that as such it would pay its dues before the Congress. The 
matter is becoming serious and we have to know where we are, or 
else you will force us to act on our own initiative and to consider 
the Social-Democratic Workers' Party as an alien body for whom 
the International has no significance. We cannot allow the 
representation of the German workers at the Congress to be 
fumbled or forfeited for reasons unknown to us, but which cannot 
be other than petty. We should like to ask for a clear statement 
about this quickly. 
Receipt for Fink shortly.

Dear Sorge, 
Just a few lines in great haste. 
I am overwhelmed with work. 
Quite apart from all the International  BUSINESS—everything  is at 
sixes and sevens—every day I have to correct the German proofs of 
the second edition of Capital (which will appear in instalments) 145 
and the épreuves* of the French translation 436 in Paris, which I 
often have to re-write completely to make matters clear to the 
French. And in addition I also have the épreuves of the  ADDRESS  ON THE 
CIVIL  WAR*  which we are bringing out in French in Brussels. You will 
be receiving a constant flow of instalments in German and French 
from me. 
In Petersburg a splendid Russian translation0 has appeared.360 
The Russian socialist paper, Die Neue Zeit (its German title, the 
paper comes out in Russian), recently published a five-column-
long leader lavishing praise on the book, which, however, was only 
meant as an introduction to a series of articles. 0 For this, the paper 
duly received a warning from the police, who threatened to 
suppress it. 
I shall send Liebknecht my answer to the jackasses from the

does no harm to leave that factory-owning mob their illusions of 
victory for a while.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 519 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 27[-28] May 1872 
Dear Liebknecht, 
Mrs Marx has shown me Eccarius' letter to you 520 and the only 
possible construction it permits is the one you have put on it and 
which we have already arrived at from other evidence, namely that 
Eccarius is mad. How deeply we have intrigued against him you 
can infer most easily from the fact that I have never said a word 
to you about the whole clique. Now, however, it is essential to put 
you au fait 
We have absolutely no idea what Eccarius can have in mind 
when he talks about intrigues directed against him ever since 
1869 (!). I only know that up to September 1870, when I arrived 
here, 122 Marx, for the sake of their longstanding friendship, had 
always helped him out of the mess he had got into often enough 
with the English,497 and whenever Marx himself had a row with 
the English it was on Eccarius' account, since the latter had always 
treated the International as his literary property and had been 
guilty of the gravest indiscretions in his Congress reports in The 
Times and in his reports to American papers. In short, he had 
always exploited the situation for his own literary ends. All this 
a of the General Rules and Administrative Regulations of the International Working 
Men's Association

could be tolerated up to a certain point and we confined ourselves 
to rebuking him in private, but the offences were always repeated. 
All of a sudden Eccarius announced that he was resigning his 
office as General Secretary and would absolutely refuse to stand for 
re-election. We had therefore to choose a successor who, in the 
circumstances, could only be an Englishman. Hales and Motters-
head stood as candidates and Hales was elected. What Eccarius' 
intentions had been was something we only discovered later when 
he told Mottershead that he had simply gone on strike so as to 
receive 30/- a week instead of 15/-. He had thought he was 
indispensable, and when this plan went wrong he twisted the facts 
to make it appear that Marx had intrigued with Hales to get him 
thrown out, and I am firmly convinced that he himself believes 
this now, although no-one could have been more surprised by his 
abdication than us. 
Then came the Conference.3 Both the General Council and the 
Conference itself had resolved that the meetings should be held in 
private. An explicit resolution, of which you are aware, charged 
the General Council with the task of deciding which resolutions 
should be made public and which not. WELL, a few days after the 
Conference an article appeared in The Scotsman*" and The 
Manchester Guardian with a detailed report on a number of the 
Conference sessions together with the Conference resolutions. 
This report then went through the entire English and European 
press.  You can imagine the uproar this provoked. Everyone cried 
treason and called for an example to be made of the traitor. In all 
the International papers a chorus of abuse fell on the General 
Council for allowing such matters to appear in the bourgeois press 
while our own papers were starved of news. 
We knew at once who the traitor was. Reports had appeared 
only about those sessions where Eccarius had been present. On the 
others there was not a single word, except for a garbled account of 
some of the resolutions. Marx took the first opportunity when we 
had Eccarius on his own to accuse him to his face and to advise 
him in all friendliness TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT, to accept his 
punishment and to be more discreet in future. He [Eccarius] did 
in fact go to see Jung, the president of the ad-hoc investigating 
commission, and told him that he had indeed given the local OFFICE 
of the New York World an article about the Conference,498 but on 
the explicit condition that its content was not revealed to the 
English press. However, he was perfectly aware of the unprinci-
a the 1871 London Conference of the International - b [J. G. Eccarius,] 'The 
International Conference', The Scotsman, No. 8789, 2 October 1871.

pled character of these people and of their connections with the 
English provincial press and must also have known that he had no 
right to sell the Conference transactions to the American press. In 
the process he made all sorts of lame excuses, saying that the 
English article contained statements not in the American article, so 
that someone else must have talked, and that someone was Hales 
in all likelihood (whose behaviour in all this business had been 
perfectly  STRAIGHTFORWARD)  and that he was the real traitor. In order to 
spare Eccarius, Jung delayed making a decision, but finally Eccarius 
was reprimanded, and since then this man, who would be ready any 
day to sell the entire International for a mess of pottage, has been all 
injured innocence. 
Despite this we were foolish enough—and you can see from this 
how we have been intriguing against him—to propose and carry 
his nomination as American secretary.331 
Since Hales' nomination a war to the knife has broken out 
between Eccarius and Mottershead, on the one hand, and Hales, 
on the other. The English have split into 3 parties, one anti-Hales, 
one pro-Hales, and a number of more or less neutral people in 
the middle. Hales also committed a host of follies—he is terribly 
vain and  WANTS  TO STAND  FOR  HACKNEY3  NEXT ELECTION—but  the attacks on 
him by the others were so ludicrously absurd that he was almost 
always in the right. In order to put an end to the commotion, 
which came to occupy the General Council almost to the exclusion 
of everything else, we were forced to appoint a sort of Comité de 
salut public b to which all personal matters are referred. 521 It is 
scarcely necessary to add that we did not hesitate to give Hales a 
good dressing-down when he deserved it, and that was often 
enough, just as we did to Eccarius or anyone else. 
At all events, Hales still has the trust of the East End 
workers—our best people here—whereas Eccarius has associated 
with the most degenerate and suspect elements all of whom are 
hand in glove with the  GREAT  LIBERAL PARTY. 
When the  BRITISH  FEDERAL COUNCIL 330 was formed, Mottershead, 
Eccarius & Co. were not invited since they did not represent any 
working men's associations. The way in which this was done was 
irregular and was criticised in the General Council, but it was very 
necessary if a repetition of the same business were to be avoided. 
This means, according to Eccarius, that we had chosen the 
DAMNABLE SIDE.

As for America, the split took place immediately after the Con­
ference422; the sub-committee (the secretaries)435  were supposed 
to report on the matter and since it was Marx who had largely 
conducted the American correspondence up to then, he took over 
the mess and all the letters went to him. It goes without saying 
that Eccarius' position as secretary was virtually suspended until 
the General Council could reach a decision on the whole business. 
There was in fact no writing to be done. He seems to have 
regarded this as yet another insult. When it came to a decision, 
Eccarius took the part of Sorge's enemies. These consist of 1) a 
few Frenchmen who, like Malon & Co. in Geneva, want to be in 
command simply because they are Frenchmen and in part 
refugees of the Commune; 2) supporters of Schweitzer (Grosse & 
Co.);  3) the Yankee bourgeois friends of Mesdames Woodhull and 
Claflin, people who have got a bad name for themselves through 
their practice of  FREE  LOVE  and who print anything and everything— 
A UNIVERSAL GOVERNMENT, SPIRITISM (à la Home) and so forth— 
anything but our  stuff.  The latter have now declared in reply to 
the resolutions of the General Council 3 that the International will 
only make progress in America if we throw out as many 
'WAGE-SLAVES' as possible, since they were certain to be the first to 
sell themselves to the BOGUS REFORMERS  AND  TRADING POLITICIANS.522 
Sorge and Co. have also made a number of formal blunders, but 
if the International in America is not to degenerate into a 
bourgeois tricksters' society pure and simple, they must have our 
full support. The good Germans (almost all the Germans), the best 
Frenchmen and all the Irish are on their side. 
Our friend Eccarius, however, had foreseen that the organ of 
Section 12, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, might provide him with a 
new literary refuge and so we are ON THE DAMNABLE SIDE. 
In short, Eccarius has become thoroughly demoralised in his 
relations with the English agitators and TRADING POLITICIANS AND 
TRADES-UNIONS PAID  SECRETARIES,  all of whom either have been bought 
by the middle class or are begging them to make them an 
offer. His personal situation, which was truly wretched, though 
partly through his own fault, and finally his literary ambitions 
have been contributing factors. He has gone so far that I have 
abandoned all hope for him. I am very sorry for him, both as an 
old friend and collaborator as well as an intelligent person, but I 
cannot conjure the facts out of existence. Moreover, in his

cynicism he admits it all quite openly. But if he imagines that we 
conspired against him and wished to expel him from the General 
Council, he is somewhat exaggerating his own importance. The 
opposite is the case: we let him go his own way despite countless 
opportunities to throw the book at him and we have not done so. 
We have confronted him with the truth only where it was quite 
unavoidable. But it was simply out of the question for us to stand 
aside while he turned the International into his own milch cow, 
riding roughshod over all other considerations. 
Incidentally, Lochner, Lessner, Pfänder and Frankel are all 
completely in the picture about Eccarius, and if you write to any 
one of them, you will be unlikely to receive such a cool and 
dispassionate reply as from me. 
28 May. News has come from America today. The separatist 
Federal Council is now in process of complete dissolution. 
Madame Woodhull and her Yankee friends from Sections 9 and 
12 have held a meeting to push her candidature as President of the 
United States523 on the basis of a programme which contains 
everything under the sun except capital and labour, and have 
made complete fools of themselves into the bargain.2  It was all just 
too much. The Lassallean Section 6 has deposed its delegate, 
Grosse, accepted the resolutions of the General Council and has 
sent a delegate to Sorge's Federal Council. Ditto Section 2, the 
worst of the French sections, which has also parted company with 
the separatist Council. Another 6 sections are about to follow suit. 
More details in the next Eastern Post. h You can see what sort of 
people Eccarius cultivated over there; all his private correspon­
dents,  Maddock, West, Elliott, etc., were present and spoke at the 
Woodhull meeting. 
All these matters are between ourselves, the deliberations of the 
General Council are not my property and I am telling you of them 
here simply for your and Bebel's own private information. 
The Belgians have debated a revision of the Rules but have not 
reached any conclusions.0  Hins has tabled a draft proposing 
abolition of the General Council. 524 I would be quite contented 
with that personally; Marx and I will not re-enter it anyway and as 
matters stand at present we have scarcely any time to work and 
that is something that has to stop.

My dear Sir, 
My reply to you has been so delayed because I had kept on 
hoping that I would be able to send you, simultaneously with the 
letter, the first instalments of the 2nd German edition of 'Capital'145 
as well as the French translation456 (Paris). But the German and 
French booksellersc have dragged the business out for so long that 
I cannot postpone it any longer. 
First of all, my best thanks for the beautifully bound copy. The 
translation is masterly.360 I would be grateful if you could let me 
have a second, unbound, copy—for the British Museum.526 
I regret that absolute [lack of time] (IN  THE  MOST STRICTEST  SENSE  OF THE 
WORD) prevented me from making a start on the revision for the 
second edition before the end of December 1871. It would have 
been of great benefit for the Russian edition. 
Although the French edition—(the translation is by Mr Roy, the 
translator of Feuerbach) —has been prepared by a great expert in 
both languages, he has often translated too literally. I have 
therefore found myself compelled to re-write whole PASSAGES in 
French, to make them palatable to the French public. It will be all 
the easier later on to translate the book from French into English 
and the Romance languages.

and Co.a  for the Brussels L'Internationale. The same thing has been 
sent to the Liberté, 
1) because it needs publicity, 2) because Mr Steens has  suppressed 
the General Council's reply to the British Parliament which was 
sent to him.b 
I have read the report on the Belgian Congressc  in the 
L'Internationale. 524 How is it that the Flemish are not included 
among the delegates? Generally speaking, according to the 
information received here by the French from their compatriots, it 
would not seem that the International has made much headway in 
Belgium after the events of the Commune. 
For my part I should be ready to accept the Hins draft (with 
modifications of detail), not because I think it is good, but because 
it is always better to make certain experiments than to lull oneself 
with illusions. 
It is very characteristic of the Alliance's10 tactics: in Spain, where 
it is strongly organised although it has lost the support of the 
Spanish Federal Council, it attacked at the Barcelona Council all 
elements of organisation, the Federal Council, etc., as well as the 
General Council. In Belgium, where 'prejudices' have to be taken 
into account, it has been proposed that the General Council be 
abolished with its functions being transferred to the Federal 
Councils (this was opposed at Barcelona) and even enlarged. 
I can hardly wait for the next Congress. It will be the end of my 
slavery. After that I shall become a free man again; I shall accept 
no administrative functions any more, either for the General 
Council or for the British Federal Council. 
Yours as ever,

Dear Friend,

In yesterday's meeting of the General Council, at which almost 
all the members of the Commune were present, Hales read out 
Praitsching's letter. 530 
I followed this up by relating the aventures of the Contre 
COUNCIL, basing myself partly on your letter, b and partly on the 
issue of the World you sent me, and I emphasised how these facts 
confirmed the necessity of the  RESOLUTIONS  adopted at my sugges­
tion.531 Eccarius  WAS THUNDERSTRUCK. 
This was followed by a useful INCIDENT which I instantly 
exploited. 
Eccarius had received a letter from St Louis in which a German 
section which had formed there inquired which of the two FEDERAL 
COUNCILS to go by. I said, naturally, they should acknowledge the 
COUNCIL that agreed with us, the old one. Hales and Eccarius 
(although mortal enemies) spoke against this. I replied and the 
motion was carried in the very well-attended meeting with only 3 
votes against (Hales, Eccarius and Delahaye—who counts for 
nothing with the other members of the Commune). 
Le Moussu will inform you of this officially tomorrow, and you 
would then do well to make it known (naturally as something 
self-evident and not on instructions from London) that, on the 
occasion of this application from that German section, the General 
Council resolved that your COUNCIL is the only one with which it is 
en règle c and hence which is recognised.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 5[-6] June 1872 
Dear Liebknecht, 
My condolences on confirmation [of your sentence].532 So much 
is certain: in no other country are our party comrades subject to 
such persecution as in the glorious Empire of Bismarck-Stieber, 
scarcely excepting even Austria. However, if there is any certainty 
in anything, it is that this sentence will never be carried out to the 
end. In France and Spain, persecution of the International (apart 
from reprisals against the COMMUNARDS) exists up to now only on 
paper, and in Italy it rarely involves more than 3 months, the rest 
being commuted to a fine, which admittedly often works out at a 
rate of 3 frs per day. 
Marx had taken Wuttke's book3  himself and kept it despite 
much pestering. Finally, I myself forgot to keep reminding him of 
it. Now I have got it from him, I read it through in a day and 
then sent it on to Borkheim with the request to look around for a 
publisher. Your memory is playing tricks on you if you believe 
that you wrote to me earlier on, asking me to look into it. I know 
only that you asked me for my opinion and that I wrote to you 
saying it would be extremely difficult to find a publisher here who 
would pay, since Wuttke is completely unknown here. I would 
otherwise have added that neither Marx nor I have those sorts of 
contacts here, otherwise we would long since have discovered one 
for Capital 
I can now add only this: 
1. Because of its many technical expressions, the book is very 
difficult to translate, almost impossible for anyone who is not in 
daily contact with English people. 
2. The book would have to be significantly adapted for lo­
cal consumption. All the waffle in the introduction and the exces­
sively long chapter on Chinese literature would have to go 
and the arcane style would have to be transformed into PLAIN 
ENGLISH. 
I think then that Borkheim is the right man to discover a 
a H. Wuttke, Geschichte der Schrift und des Schrifttums...

publisher, if this is at all possible. A businessman who seems totally 
unconnected with literature often has the best chance of succeed­
ing with these things. It was Strohn after all who put us in touch 
with Meissner in Hamburg. At all events, do not count too much 
on Borkheim succeeding and do not waste time translating until 
he comes up with someone. 
6 June. Wroblewski interrupted me yesterday and stayed the 
whole evening, so I can now answer your letter of the 4th as well, 
which I received this morning. I am sorry that you have to 
go inside so soon, but I hope you will not be in there for 
long. 
The proofs of the Manifesto together with a short preface3 will 
go off as soon as possible, tomorrow, I hope.1 
Best thanks for the information about individuals,533 but there is 
still no answer to my question about how your Party intends to put 
its relations with the General Council on a clear footing, without 
which it will be absolutely impossible for it to be represented at the 
Congress.15

Nothing can be done in the matter of the inheritance, if the 
people are reluctant to risk money. These things have to be looked 
at by lawyers, and they do nothing  ON SPECULATION.  Anyway, the best 
the heirs could hope for would be the satisfaction of knowing that 
they had been swindled. They cannot reckon on salvaging any 
money after all these years—it is 100:1 AGAINST.

...a have every confidence in the character of Mr Glaser whom 
you will, I have no doubt, always find straightforward in all his 
dealings. As to his means I cannot give you any definite 
information but as I have the confidence in him that he would not 
order more than he was justified in doing, I should not hesitate to 
give him a moderate credit say a couple of £100—or even more. 
I think if you were to limit your credit at the beginning 
to £200—and then extend it afterwards as the business goes on 
and you get better acquainted with him, you would be pretty 
safe. 
It is what I should do in your case.

the midst of the International, a secret society ' which seeks to 
control it; we have proof of this as regards Spain, and the 
situation in Italy must be the same. These men, who always have 
the words autonomy and free federation on their lips, treat the 
workers like a flock of sheep, only good for being steered by the 
leaders of this secret society, using it for purposes of which the 
mass is unaware. You had a good example in Terzaghi (an 
investigation is being demanded into the handing over of the 
letter).  Having rebelled against the whole organisation of the 
International, and knowing that it will have great difficulty in 
justifying itself at the Congress next September,450 the Jura 
Committee is now looking for letters and mandates from the 
General Council in order to fabricate false accusations against us. 
I, like all of us, willingly consent to all letters being read to the 
Congress, but we do not find it agreeable to learn that the same 
letters, written for this or that section, have been put at the 
disposal of these gentlemen. 
The circular3 makes things known. We urge you meanwhile to 
suspend all decisions and you will subsequently act as the interest 
of the International dictates. I hope you will find that it is not the 
General Council, but these men of the Jura, acting solely to 
further the personal ambitions of Bakunin, head of the secret 
society, who have sown discord.

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 150 
IN LIEGE 
London, 10 June 1872 
Dear Cuno, 
A few words in all haste. I have today sent by first post to 
Herman 2 copies (one of them for you) of the circular of the 
General Council on the Bakuninist intrigues, 3385 wrapped in a 
copy of the Kölnische Zeitung. You will find in it all the material 
you need from A to Z. 
We now possess accurate information on the Spanish secret 
society, La Aleanza—it will be quite a surprise to that gang at the 
Congress. The same society doubtless exists in Italy. If only Regis 
could get down there! But the poor devil is now peddling 
newspapers in Geneva, to earn a living as best he can. Cafiero in 
Naples and someone else in Turin whom I don't yet know turned 
letters of mine over to the Jurassians535; that doesn't matter to me 
in itself,  but the very fact of their perfidy is unpleasant. The 
Italians will still have to pass through a school of experience to 
realise that a peasant people as backward as they are merely makes 
itself ridiculous when it tries to prescribe to the workers of big 
industrial nations the road they should take for their emancipa­
tion. 
Incidentally, I no longer receive any Italian newspapers, so I 
cannot send you any. Cafiero, who always used to send them, has 
obviously got a bad conscience. 
You will have received the letter from Düsseldorf, which I sent 
536 
on to you. 
We know that affairs are in pretty bad shape in Belgium. The 
apathy of this neutral nation (sit venia verbo h) is the underlying 
reason for the fact that a plotter and a jackass can call the tune 
there. The International is falling apart in Belgium by the day, 
thanks to the inertia of the intelligent and reliable men among the 
leaders. Incidentally, the clique's leaders have done us a tremen­
dous service with their new draft Rules. The proposal for the 
abolition of the General Council 524 has put an end to the last 
vestiges of their influence (which was far from small, since this was

one of the oldest federations). The Spaniards call this downright 
treason.537  It's a pity that you're not going to Spain; you would like 
these people; après tout* they are the most gifted of all the Latins, 
and you could be very useful there. What they need is a dose of 
German theory, and they take it very well; besides, they are 
distinguished by a fanaticism and a class hatred of the bourgeois 
such as we northerners or the vacillating Italians cannot imagine. 
The true author of the Belgian draft for the Rules is, of course, 
Bakunin again. The draft is by Hins and he is a tool of Bakunin 
both by virtue of a spiritual affinity and because of his Russian 
wife. 
Liebknecht is going into the cachot 0 on the 15th of this month. 538 
As soon as my friends are back in Manchester, I shall again take 
a look around on your  behalf.  I can do nothing for the moment. 
For all your misfortunes, you nevertheless have the luck to have a 
profession which you can follow anywhere fairly easily, at least on 
the Continent, if needs be. Here, because of the different 
employment system, it is much more difficult. 
Your recent description0  of the impression Düsseldorf made 
upon you made me laugh heartily. Why, for us, the philistine 
Wuppertalers, Düsseldorf was always a little Paris, where the pious 
gentlemen of Barmen and Elberfeld kept their mistresses, went to 
the theatre, and had a right royal time. But the sky always looks 
grey where one's own reactionary family lives. Moreover, the 
process of industrial development, which has after all spread to 
Düsseldorf as well, is extremely depressing and deadly boring 
throughout Germany, so that I can well imagine that Wuppertal's 
dreariness and wretchedness have now conquered Düsseldorf as 
well. But one fine day we shall send them packing, and then we'll 
sing the old song again that they used to sing thirty years ago in 
Milan: 
We, we, always we, 
And if we go out on a spree, 
Who'll have to pay for it? We! 
But it will be the bourgeois that will have to pay for the spree.

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 
IN GENEVA 
London, 14 June 1872 
Dear old Friend, 
We are not entirely in agreement with your calculations about 
the Congress. The Jurassians with their well-known manoeuvres, 
for example, and the Italians would certainly send close to 30 
delegates on their own, if not 50. But unfortunately that is the 
least of our worries at the moment. What makes it impossible to 
hold the Congress in Switzerland this year is the unfortunate and 
quite unnecessary division between the German- and French-
speaking Swiss workers which occurred on the revision of the 
Constitution539—a rift that has given the Jurassians such a 
wonderful opportunity to rejoice and solemnly expatiate on the 
superiority of their policy of abstention.3  We here cannot help 
thinking that the two sides are equally to blame. The revised Swiss 
Constitution was at most no more than an extremely moderate 
bourgeois step forward. While, on the one hand, it forced the 
barbarians of the original cantons to bestir themselves a little, on 
the other hand, it could act as a brake to the most progressive 
cantons and in particular Geneva, which—as an industrial city 
which is also an autonomous republic—is in an exceptionally 
well-favoured position, since it would place them under the 
control of the overall Swiss peasant majority. So depending on the 
locality there was something to be said both for and against the 
revision; my personal sympathies were, if anything, for rather than 
against. But it is certain that the whole business was not worth the 
trouble of creating a dispute within the International and of giving 
the Jurassians the opportunity to crow: Look we savages are the 
better human beings, nous nous abstenons? while the others quarrel 
over trifles and so prove that all politics are of the devil.—We are 
very well aware how things work in a place like Geneva, which is, 
after all, still pretty small, and in Switzerland as a whole for that 
matter, where everyone knows everyone else personally and so 
every political movement assumes the form of gossip and intrigue.

So we do not take the whole thing too seriously and are convinced 
that proletarian sentiments will once more gain the upper hand in 
a short time and put everything back on an even keel. But as I 
said, it does unfortunately make it impossible to hold the Congress 
in Geneva, and so we are thinking now of Holland.450 
Utin, who is a fine fellow for all this (even though a Russian is, 
of course, neither a Frenchman nor a German), will be better off 
for being away from the local Genevan cliques. Incidentally, I have 
written as much to him in a letter,45  saying that we are by no 
means of his opinion on the subject of federalism as he has been 
preaching it in the Egalité. 540 But all these questions are secondary 
and our real battle-field lies quite elsewhere. I hope to hear soon 
that you two non-Swiss will have forgotten your local Swiss 
quarrels and have got together to drown your sorrows in Yvorne 
or Cortaillod. Think of the hue and cry there would have been 
throughout the Swiss Federal Assembly if you two had proposed 
to them the liberation of the workers by the workers themselves! 
Vaillant is well enough up to now and so is Frankel—who is 
even better than well since he is of a very amorous nature. I saw 
Jung yesterday and he seems to have recovered from the 
rheumatism that plagued him 18 months ago. Marx is also 
significantly improved on last winter, but is very busy with the 2nd 
German edition 396 and the French translation of Capital?36  which 
is coming out now. The Russian edition has appeared and is very 
good. As for the Russians in general, there is an enormous 
difference between those who came to Europe earlier on—noble, 
aristocratic Russians, among whom we must include Herzen and 
Bakunin and who are swindlers to the last man—and those who 
are coming now, all of whom are of the people. As far as talent and 
character are concerned, some of these are absolutely among the 
very best in our party. They have a stoicism, a strength of 
character and at the same time a grasp of theory which are truly 
admirable.

No newspapers received from him since 16 May, although The 
Eastern Post, etc., sent regularly. How come?a  Might it be too much 
of a coincidence that at the same time (10 May) the Bulletin 
jurassien boasts of having in its possession private letters from me 
to friends in Italy 'full of odious slanders', 5 etc., etc.? In any case, 
I have not written to anyone in Italy other than you, and it must 
be these letters of mine to you that Schwitzguébel's paper is 
referring to. You owe me an explanation of that matter and I 
expect you to give it to me. I am amazed that you did not supply 
it as soon as this was published. 
My letters have nothing to fear from publication, but it is a 
question of honour for you to inform me whether they were sent 
to my enemies with your consent or not. If it was done with your 
consent, I can only come to one conclusion: that you have allowed 
yourself to be persuaded to join the Bakuninist secret society, the 
Alliance10 which, preaching to the profane—behind the mask of 
autonomy, anarchy and anti-authoritarianism—the breaking up of 
the International's organisation, practises towards its initiates an 
absolute authoritarianism, with the aim of taking over the 
leadership of the Association. It is a society which treats the 
working masses as a flock of sheep, led by a few initiates whom 
they follow blindly, and which imitates, within the International, 
the role of the Jesuits in the Catholic Church. 
If my conjecture is correct, I must congratulate you on having 
permanently safeguarded your precious 'autonomy' by delivering 
it entirely into the hands of Pope Bakunin. But I cannot believe 
that you, an anarchist and anti-authoritarian of the first water, 
should have so far forsworn your dearest principles, still less that 
you could stoop to such depths towards  myself,  when I have

Dear Friend, 
I received what you sent on 7 June yesterday (together with the

You will in the meantime have received my second letter,3  ditto 
Le Moussu's letter, which definitively formulates the COUNCIL'S 
position  for the  UNITED STATES. 
The next Congress will be held on the first Monday in 
September 1872 in The Hague (Holland)450—the official notifica­
tion will be sent to New York next week. It simply will not do for 
you to fob us off with a memorandum. At this Congress the life 
or death of the International will be at stake. You yourself and at least 
one other, if not two, must attend. As for the sections which do not 
send delegates directly, they can send mandates (mandates for dele­
gates). 
The Germans for me, F. Engels, Lochner, Karl Pfänder, Lessner. 
The French for G. Ranvier, Auguste Serraillier, Le Moussu, 
Ed. Vaillant, F. Cournet, Ant Arnaud 
The Irish for MacDonnel, who is doing very well, or if they 
prefer, for one of the above-named Germans or French. 
Naturally, only 1 delegate for each section, however numerous, 
unless it has over 500.

You will already know of the beautiful Belgian project to revise 
the Rules.3  It stems from Hins, an ambitieux impuissant, 11 who, to­
gether with his Russian wife, takes orders from Bakounine. One 
of its finest features is the abolition of the GENERAL COUNCIL. 524 The 
whole plan has been deservedly hauled over the coals in La 
Emancipacion (Madrid), the organ of the Spanish Federal Coun­
cil.53  The same paper gave enthusiastic approval to our American 
resolutions.544 
From the enclosed copy of the Egalité you will see that the 
Congrès Romand has also rapped Hins over the knuckles. 545 
I am sending you by post 4 COPIES of the Circulaire of the GENERAL 
COUNCIL on Les prétendues scissions dans l'Internationale." Engels has 
despatched 200 to you per PARCEL COMPANY. 
As for my Capital, the first German instalment will be published 
next week,396 ditto the first French instalment in Paris.43  You will 
be getting copies of both regularly from me for you and some of 
your friends. Of the French edition (the title-page of which reads, 
by no means as a mere phrase, 'entièrement révisée par l'auteur', d for 
I have had the devil of a job with it), 10,000 COPIES have been 
printed and  8,000  sold already before publication of the first 
instalment. 
In Russia, books after printing is completed but before they are 
released to the public, must be submitted to the censorship 
authority, which must file suit in court if it does not want to pass 
them. 
They write me as follows from Russia regarding the Russian 
translation (a masterly one) of my book360: 
'In the censorship office two censors went over the work and laid their 
conclusions before the censorship committee. Even before the examination it was 
decided in principle not to hold this book up merely because of the author's name, 
but to make a close investigation of how far it really corresponds to its title. The 
following is a summary of the conclusion that was unanimously adopted by the 
censorship committee and submitted to the Main Administration for decision: 
' "Although the author, according to his convictions, is a thorough-going socialist 
and the whole book has a quite definite socialist character, nevertheless, in view or 
the fact that the presentation can by no means be called accessible to everyone and 
that, on the other hand, it possesses the form of a rigidly mathematical scientific 
demonstration, the Committee declares the prosecution of this book in court to be 
impossible."'546

[London,] 21 June 1872 
Dear Citizen, 
Many thanks for your letter.548 Everywhere the same thing is 
going on. Everywhere it is non-working men who hamper the 
advance of the International and who intrigue against the General 
Council precisely because it represents the general interest and 
stands in the way of their petty personal ambitions. 
According to the General Regulations, we have the right to ask 
the Belgian Federal Council for a copy of its printed regulations, 
and for information regarding the financial position of the 
sections and the number of members. We shall make these 
requests in such a manner as not to arouse suspicion. 

=====第435页=====
237. Marx to Suetendael. 21 June 1872 401 
As for the Paris correspondent, I now have his name.3 
According to the General Regulations, II, Art. 5b: 'The General 
Council has the right to admit or to refuse the affiliation of any new 
society or group, subject to appeal to the Congress. Nevertheless, 
where there exist Federal Councils or Committees, the General 
Council is bound to consult them before admitting or rejecting the 
affiliation of a new branch or society, without prejudice, however, to 
its right of provisional decision'. 
Thus,  the new section now forming in Brussels has only to write 
to the General Council (and it may use my address, the Belgian 
secretary being away) and state that it wishes to form 'an 
independent society', in direct relation with the General Council. It 
must explain (without holding anything back) the reasons why it 
wants to constitute itself independently of the Belgian Federal 
Council. Whereupon, the General Council must consult the Belgian 
Council, however, 'without prejudice to its right of decision'. 
The Federation of Working Men's Societies of which you speak 
would be well-advised, when nominally constituting several sec­
tions (say 3 or 4), to request the Council to admit them all at the 
same time. Their very number would make it easier for the 
General Council to act. For the fact that several societies in 
Brussels desired to constitute themselves independently of the 
Belgian Federal Council would of itself provide serious presump­
tive evidence against the latter. Once admitted by the General 
Council, the said societies will have the right to send delegates to 
the next Congress—either a common delegate or one delegate per 
society. The next Congress will take place at The Hague,45 on the 
first Monday of September 1872. I shall be sending an official 
communication to that effect to the Brussels Internationale in a few 
days'  time.c 
As for the Hins draft 524 (Hins and his wife are correspondents 
and agents of Bakunin), this has had a very bad reception in all the 
countries from which we have heard so far, France, Germany, 
England, etc. 
In L'Egalité (organ of the Romance Federal Council), which I

Council, has published two articles against the Hins draft. 537 
a Léon Adrien Massenet - b K. Marx, General Rules and Administrative Regulations of 
the International Working Men's Association. - c  See F. Engels, 'Announcement of the 
General Council on the Convocation and the Agenda of the Congress at The Hague', 
L'Internationale, No. 182, 7 July 1872. 

=====第436页=====
402 237. Marx to Suetendael. 21 June 1872 
The first article is in the issue of 8 June and is entitled 'The 
Belgian Draft of the General Rules'. 
It says, among other things: 
'If the draft stood the slightest chance of being accepted, this would of itself 
suffice to disorganise the International... The Congresses, which take place only 
once a year, cannot serve as a true link uniting the various federations. The 
immediate effect of the suppression of the General Council would be to disrupt the 
unity of the Association and the strength deriving therefrom... Consistency would 
further demand the suppression of the federal and local Councils, etc. ... The 
suppression of the General Council would spell death to the International.' 
The Volksfreund ('Friend of the People'), the organ of the 
International sections of Brunswick, gave the Hins draft a thorough 
trouncing. 3 Among other things it says that, if the working men of 
other countries were to imitate those of Belgium, the International 
would be transformed from a society organised for struggle into 
an incoherent mass of pietistic549 socialist conventicles. In its issue 
of 16 June it returns to the charge.b 
It refers to the police Conference (consisting of Prussian, 
Austrian, Hungarian, etc., functionaries) which is to be held in 
Berlin in August and is to discuss measures to be taken by 
governments against the International. One of the first measures 
adumbrated by these gentlemen is to confine the proletarian 
movement within the national boundaries of each country. The 
Volksfreund concludes its article by saying: Thus it is the despotic 
governments on the Continent which, in order to destroy the 
International, propose to break the ties which bind the various 
national proletarian movements to the centre in London. 
'Let our friends, the Belgians, ponder this: If we are reduced to the national 
level, as proposed by Bismarck's agents in Berlin,0 we shall be killed off in all the 
Continental countries, one after the other, by the reactionary forces. If, on the 
other hand, we retain our centre in London and thus remain Europeans, we shall 
be invulnerable. Our General Council and headquarters in London is not accessible 
to the blows struck by reaction: it would succumb in one situation only: if 
government agents were able to stir up successful rebellions against the common 
centre of the Association among the ranks of continental Internationalists.' 
Letters from the French sections express contempt for the Hins 
draft and say, for example, that according to this fine draft, 
France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary—in a word, 
all those countries where the International is prevented by the 
a B. Becker, 'Der Kongreß der belgischen Internationale', Braunschweiger 
Volksfreund, No. 129, 5 June 1872. - b 'Die anti-sozialistische Konferenz in Berlin', 
Braunschweiger Volksfreund, No. 139, 16 June 1872. - c Italics by Marx.

governments from forming official federations, will be virtually 
excluded from the International 1) because it is intended to 
deprive them of their right to vote at Congresses, and 2) because, 
circumstances being what they are, the different sections in those 
countries would, without the General Council, lose all unified 
organisation and all reciprocal ties. 
So, as you can see, the Hins draft will prove a fiasco. But there 
is one thing you must not forget! If the Federal Council sends 
deputies to the Hague Congress, insist that they be given precise 
written mandates signed by all the members of the Federal Council That 
is the only way to prevent the trickery to which the friends of the 
Alliance 10 never hesitate to stoop in furtherance of their own 
particular little plans. 
It goes without saying that you need fear no indiscretion, 
however slight, on my part. 
Fraternal greetings,

ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 2 July 1872 
Dear Hepner, 
When mandatesa are sent out it is absolutely essential to include 
one for Cuno, who is now in Belgium. He is of the greatest 
importance because of the Italian Bakuninists; these people will 
send nothing but lawyers and other doctrinaire bourgeois who 
play at being workers' representatives and who have done 
everything in their power to prevent the workers from corres-
a for delegates to the Hague Congress

ponding with us directly. It was precisely Cuno who was the first 
to break through this barrier and, had he remained there, the 
whole problem would have been solved by now. Moreover, Cuno 
is one of our very best people; Liebknecht's entire mistrust of him 
is groundless and is based on his belief that Cuno was an agent of 
J. Ph. Becker, working in the interests of the Geneva 'Mother 
Section', something that never crossed Cuno's mind. I had to 
explain the whole absurd story to him later on since he knew 
nothing about the Mother Section." When I know what a man 
has really accomplished, I do not let myself be misled by such 
matters. 
It goes without saying that the Congress deliberations will be 
conducted in all 3 languages—German, English and French — so 
that ignorance of the two last languages need deter no-one.450 
Returning herewith Boruttau's letter.550  The man is assuredly 
honest, but terribly muddle-headed and driven on by an urge to 
perform deeds out of all proportion to his talents. These qualities 
make him a highly suitable DUPE for the Bakuninists who surround 
him and exploit him. If you read the Bulletin de la Fédération 
jurassienne, you will see that precisely now, before the Congress, 
these gentlemen are doing all they can to obtain private letters and 
so forth from us and to discover what material damaging to them 
we have in our possession. 0 Apart from that the Boruttau letter is 
of no significance. It would not occur to us to do additional work 
for these gentlemen to our own detriment. If Boruttau is so 
unfamiliar with notorious facts which even Bakunin has never 
denied, it is not our responsibility'to look up the issue of Kolokol 
where he can find it all, i.e. if he knows Russian, for if he doesn't, 
even referring him to the right issue will not help him.c  So much 
is certain: we have the material. Moreover, as long as 3 years ago 
Borkheim published more on this matter in his Russische Briefe 43 
than six Boruttaus could ask for. You would be well advised to 
tread warily with Boruttau. The magniloquent phrases of the 
Bakuninists have completely beguiled this muddle-head and this 
over-intense sort of honesty often turns into treachery in practice.

publication. We do not know how the (legitimist) Courrier de France 
in Paris—which is publishing it—obtained possession of it. 
Likewise with the Radical, which may have taken it from the 
Courrier. A German translation in the Volksstaat (which you would 
have to produce over there) would only be desirable if the 
bourgeois press in Germany makes a scandal of the affair—but in 
that event it would be very desirable indeed In the meantime the 
Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne has publicly attacked it, 551 so an 
article in the Volksstaat could do no harm. I assume that 
Liebknecht has left you the copy we sent him. If not, I shall send 
you one in a letter—a postal wrapper is impossible since the police 
have stolen everything I sent to Germany in that way. 
Henri Perret, Temple Unique, Genève, has been instructed to 
send the ' Volksstaat ' 50 copies for distribution in Germany. If they 
have not yet arrived, please drop him a few lines. 
I shall write to Wigand552 
'Schulze-Bastiat''. Marx is buried up to his ears in work on the 
2nd German edition396 and the 1st French edition of Capital436 
But even apart from this he would never agree to write an 
appendix to correct the blunders in such a completely unscientific 
book as Lassalle's.3  He would have to correct almost the whole 
book. Entre nous if Marx ever does get around to correcting 
Lassalle there will be precious little of Lassalle left over. He has 
not done so up to now out of consideration for the many 
Lassalleans who have joined the Party, but one day it is sure to 
come. 
'The Housing Question'. Liebknecht spoke of his intention 
of publishing my article b on its own.504 If this is the case, please 
let me have the galley proofs since there are a number of disas­
trous printing errors in it. There is also the following to be consi­
dered: 
You write to me about Sax. Is it worthwhile writing a special 
article on a book0 which appeared in 1869? If so, I shall give the 
man a good hiding for you, and it would perhaps be a good idea 
to follow up the critique of the petit bourgeois solution to the 
housing problem with a critique of the grand bourgeois solution. 
In that event the two articles'1 could be published together on 
their own, which would provide a more exhaustive treatment of

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 150 
IN LIÈGE 
London, 5 July 1872 
Dear Cuno, 
I sent some English and Spanish newspapers to Herman for you 
yesterday. 
The Belgians make the same impression on everyone who comes 
in contact with them. The whole International there is just so 
much hot air and nothing more. This is chiefly the fault of the 
leaders, of whom only De Paepe is really capable, although 
indolent, while Hins is empty-headed, but cunning, scheming, 
ambitious and energetic. Through his Russian wife Hins is in 
direct contact with Bakunin and on the latter's instructions he has 
devised a salubrious project to abolish the General Council. 524 Hins 
is at present in Verviers. You would be doing us a service if you 
could keep an eye on him. 
There is also a German section in Verviers which is in 
correspondence with the Volksstaat. I wrote to their correspondent, 
P. Schlehbach, rue de Pont 2, (on 14 June) 45 and also sent a copy 
of the Scissions,11385 but have had no reply up to now. It would be a 
good idea if you could slip over there and establish contact with 
them. I have written to Hepnerb saying that they should send you a 
mandate from Germany for the Congress.450  To be on the safe side, 
however, it would be good if you could also get the German section in 
Verviers to give you a mandate from them in case they do not send 
someone of their own. Bakunin & Co. will make every effort to beat 
us at the Congress, and as these gentlemen have no scruples about 
methods, we must take precautionary measures. They will send 
delegates from a hundred different societies not belonging to the 
International at all, and will try to obtain a seat and a vote for 
these persons as delegates of the International in order to place 
the General Council in the minority with the aid of a coalition of 
the most heterogeneous elements. Schweitzer and Hasenclever 
have already concluded an avowed alliance with the scoundrels 
over here— Vésinier, Landeck, Smith, Schneider, etc.— while the 
latter, in turn, are corresponding with the Jurassians and the 
American rogues (see the Emancipation 554 I sent yesterday).

408 240. Engels to Cuno. 5 July 1872 
How have the Scissions been received there? I have sent 
Herman 5 copies in all, but they must be distributed. Is Herman 
doing that? And how is he doing in general? I heard that at the 
last Belgian Congress he spoke out very vigorously in favour of 
the General Council. 
It is questionable whether you can qualify for Belgian citizen­
ship.  American citizenship is only obtainable by prior registration 
and five years' residence in the country. 
The Congress will be held in any event. On the Continent there 
is never any guarantee against police interference; but then we will 
have to get aboard a steamer, go to England, and hold it there. It 
would be inexpedient to convene it in England from the very start, 
for although it would be quite safe from police interference here, 
it would nevertheless be subjected to attacks by our enemies. The 
General Council, they would say, is convening the Congress in 
England because only there does it possess an artificial majority. 
Bakunin has issued a furious, but very weak, abusive letter in 
reply to the Scissions.555 That fat elephant is beside himself with 
rage because he has finally been dragged from his Locarno lair 
out into the light, where neither scheming nor intrigues are of any 
more use. Now he declares that he is the victim of a conspiracy of 
all the European—Jewsl 
What will break the old scoundrel's neck is the continued 
existence of the 'Alliance'10—at least in Spain—as a secret society. 
Not only do we have proof of this, but the affair has now become 
quite public in Madrid, etc., so that there can be no denying it any 
more. This gentleman, who everywhere acted as the most 
devoted champion of the International, organised this quiet 
conspiracy to seize overall control and, with the assistance of his 
initiated Jesuit brothers, to lead the broad masses of workers by 
the nose like a blind herd! If this had been tolerated, I wouldn't 
have remained in the International for a day. To be Bakunin's 
sheep—that would have been the limit! The hardest blow of all 
for him is that we have uncovered this whole story and are 
threatening to expose him at the Congress. And now Lafargue 
(Marx's son-in-law, who has been in Madrid for 8 months) is 
accusing him, Bakunin, of having drawn up by his own hand and 
sent to Spain the secret instructions on how the International was 
to be run there!a

Dear Kugelmann, 
My best thanks for the gift of £15 for Jennychen. I have worked 
myself so much into the ground that today (in 2 hours) I am 
leaving London with Engels for 4 or 5 days, and going to the 
seaside (Ramsgate). 556 From the date of my return until 2 Sep­
tember (when the international Congress is to meet at The 
Hague 450) I shall have my hands more than full, but from then on 
I shall have more free time again. But this freedom will not begin 
until mid-September, because I myself shall go to The Hague. 
Perhaps we could see each other later (that is, you could see me, 
for I would not be safe in Germany). 
Adio.

To punish Meissner it would be good if 3101t were to write him on the 
pretext of wanting to know when the 'first' instalment will finally 
appear. You can then remark, quite en passant, that from my last 
letters it seemed to you that I was feeling very embittered towards 
Meissner and very dissatisfied with him; what is the reason for that? 
It is not my usual manner! The fellow has really annoyed me very

IN FLORENCE 
[Draft] 
[London, 18 July 1872] 
Citizen, 
In reply to your letter of 27 June, postmarked Florence 6 July, 
and which, not being correctly addressed, reached me not until 
the 16th of this month, I should advise you that we have no other 
flag than that of the world proletariat, the red flag. 
It would appear from the same letter that your society has 
constituted itself and considers itself as a section of the Interna­
tional; it is therefore my duty to inform you that the General 
Regulations currently in force require the completion of a number 
of formalities before new sections can be admitted.560 
Section II, Art. 4 states: 
Every new branch or society intending to join the International, 
is bound immediately to announce its adhesion to the General 
Council. The General Council has the right, etc. (Basle resolution). 
And in Section V, Art. 1: 
Every branch has the right to make particular rules and 
bye-laws, adapted to the local circumstances and the laws of its 
country; but these must in no respect contain anything contrary to 
the General Rules and Regulations (Geneva resolution).561 
And since, according to Section II, Art. 2, 'the General Council 
is bound to execute the resolutions of Congresses', to which it is 
responsible, this General Council cannot recognise as sections of 
the International any societies other than those which have 
conformed to these articles, agreed to abide by the General Rules 
and Regulations of the Association, and whose Rules it has 
recognised as being in conformity with the General Rules and 
Regulations. We are sure that you have omitted to do this only 
because you were unaware of these rules, of which an authentic 
Italian edition does not exist. I therefore enclose a copy in French 
with the relevant articles marked in red. 
As the Congress is approaching (2 September, in The Hague,450 
Holland) we would also draw your attention to Article 7 of 
Section I, which states: 'Only the delegates of such societies, 
sections or groups as form parts of the International, and shall 

=====第446页=====

have paid their contributions to the General Council (10 c. per 
member), will in future be allowed to take their seats and to vote 
at Congresses.' 
Greetings and brotherhood.

ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER 150 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 4 August 1872 
Dear Hepner, 
I was about to write a brief article for you on the latest 
Bakuninist affairs, when it developed that the General Council 
would have to make a statement on the matter  itself.  Thus the 

=====第449页=====
247. Engels to Hepner. 4 August 1872 415 
article has turned into an address,563 the German translation of 
which you will receive on Wednesday.3 
The latest Spanish documents may well serve as a supplement 
shortly.564  Bakunin retained the Alliance de la démocratie socialiste, 10 
which you know of from the  Scissions, b 385 as a secret society in 
order to obtain control of the International. But we learned of 
this, and now we have the  proof.  Thus, the charge will now be 
made publicly, as otherwise the elections to the Congress in Spain450 
would be run by the Alliance and their outcome would be in its 
favour. Bakunin will break his neck in this affair. 
You will have received the reply to the Concordia.'492 So that is 
what the armchair socialists amount to! I had not thought that they 
could be as stupid as that, I had thought that the paper must be 
edited by someone like Beta-Bettziech. 
The factum of Verdy was something I knew from the Kölnische 
Zeitung, but I did not know that the man was also a trickster. 665 
Very fine. That wretched Sonnemann, incidentally, regards every 
great historical event merely as an opportunity to change his lousy 
Frankfurt back into a free city of the Empire. And for this reason 
the Prussians must always serve as whipping-boy. According to our 
information, the preparations are being made on such a colossal 
scale that the Prussians can be defeated only if they are opposed 
by Austria, as well as France and Russia. But Austria will be on 
Prussia's side, unless some sudden change occurs, which is not to be 
expected in the circumstances. Moreover, we shall soon witness the 
diverting spectacle of William d issuing an appeal to the Poles and 
re-establishing some sort of Poland. And with this he, and the 
whole Prussian regime, will break their necks. The Prusso-German 
Empire is far from having reached its culminating point; this war 
(if it ends well, which is to be expected) will swiftly raise it to its 
climax, and then it will come tumbling down from the dizzy 
heights of Napoleonic glory. It is quite possible that this time the 
movement will start in Berlin; the contradictions are growing very 
acute there, and all that is required to bring things to a head is a 
change in the political situation. A Berlin revolution of that kind 
will certainly be pretty rough, but still it is better for it to come 
from within than after a Sedan, which only brings harm 
everywhere.566

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 
IN LIÈGE 
London, 4 August 1872 
Dear Cuno, 
The Belgian Federal Council could not have done us a greater 
favour than by taking action against the German section in 
Verviers.567 By doing that it shows how necessary it is to have a 
General Council in order to defend the autonomy of the sections 
against the Federal Councils. The Belgian Federal Council, how­
ever, cannot exclude the German section from the International, 
but only from the Belgian Federation: 
'Administrative Regulations Section IV: Federal Councils or Committees, 
Article 4. Any Federation may refuse to admit or may exclude from its midst 
societies or branches. It is, however, not empowered to deprive them of their International 
character.'a 
Thus as an independent section, the German section in Verviers 
has, under Art. 7 of the General Rules (end of the Article), the 
a See present edition, Vol. 23, p. 12. Engels quotes in French; the italics by 
him.

right to correspond directly with the General Council. Please draw 
their attention to this fact and urge them to write to us; up to now 
nothing has arrived here. 
Has Schlehbach in Verviers received my letter" and why does he 
not reply? 
I am sending you an issue of the Emancipaciôn and a circular in 
Spanish by Lafargue (Marx's son-in-law) b and would like you to 
study it carefully. You will see from it what was at stake for 
Bakunin: a secret society within the International to gain control 
of the latter. Fortunately, the plan has now come to light and just 
in time. This business will break Bakunin's neck. The General 
Council will issue an Address devoted to it on Tuesday,0 also 
indicting the Spanish Federal Council, which has 5 members of 
the Alliance sitting on it.563 
In all haste—I have to edit this Address and have a terrible 
amount of other work for the International in preparation for the 
Congress.450 
Yours, 
F. E.

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 
IN GENEVA 
London, 5 August 1872 
My dear old Friend, 
The fact that the Congress is to be held in The Hague450 is due, 
above all, to your unfortunate split3 on the question of revising 
the constitution.539 We could not foresee where that would lead 
and had no time to waste. However, there are also the following 
considerations to be borne in mind: 
1. We have not overestimated the strength of the Jurassians. On 
their own count, and this is confirmed by their membership dues, 
they number 294, including Section Longemalle with 62, and also 
74 newly joined graveurs and guillocheurs. h But we know their 
tactics. Of the 62 Longemallers every one would have managed to 
obtain an illicit mandate by some means or other; then there are 
the people from the Jura  itself,  say a dozen, and then some 20 
Italians and 6 Spaniards—which makes more than enough. In 
these circumstances some of the Belgians would have gone over to 
their side. 
2. As for the forged mandates, they would have around 30-40 
from America (from the Woodhull people), around a dozen from 
here (from the sections forming the UNIVERSAL FEDERALIST COUNCIL417 
which have never been affiliated to the International), around 
50-60 from the German Schweitzerians who joined the Federalist 
Council directly, and if they play their cards well, they would also 
receive a fair number from Spain. I shall deal with Italy in a 
moment. So there was every chance that when the mandates are 
scrutinised—and this time everything depends on that—the 
societies which wish to force their way into the International 
without ever having belonged to it would have been able to gain 
entry with a majority, particularly when you remember how 
tolerant the workers usually are in such matters and how things 
worked out at all previous Congresses. Moreover, it should not be 
forgotten that there will be enough sections on our side, too, 
whose dues are not in order and which will have to take an 
indulgent line in voting so as to ensure that they too may be 
See this volume, pp. 395-96. - b engravers and etchers 

=====第453页=====
249.  Engels to J. Ph. Becker. 5 August 1872 419 
treated indulgently. And if that were to happen we would have 
had no choice but to take our hats and leave the Internatio­
nal. 
3. You underestimate the power of the Alliance10 in Italy. In 
the whole of Italy we have only one section, Turin, of whose 
quality we are certain; and perhaps Ferrara. Milan has been, since 
Cuno's departure, completely in the hands of the Bakuninists, 
Naples always was and the Fascio Operaio in Emilia, the Romagna 
and Tuscany486 is wholly under Bakunin's influence. These people 
constitute an International of their own, they have never applied 
for membership, have never paid dues, but they act as if they 
belonged to the International. Directed by members of the secret 
Alliance, they are very numerous and at a rate of 1 delegate for 
50 members they could easily elect 40 delegates, 15-20 of whom 
would be sent from there and the rest would come from 
Longemalle, provided with blank mandates. 
4. The Belgians will not swamp The Hague, they are reluctant 
to pay. Moreover, the last Congress in Brussels has proved 
that when matters come to a head, they are not so bad at all. They 
have resolved that only sections that have been properly recog­
nised can be represented in The Hague, and that is the main 
thing. 
5. Finally, you should have read Schwitzguébel's hypocritical 
letter 3 complaining that the Congress is not to be held in 
Switzerland and already giving a gentle hint of a future protest.569 
If nothing else had shown me that we were pursuing the right 
tactics, this would. 
At all events, pack your things and come, you will see that all 
will be well. But only if we, too, turn out in force. The othersb  are 
fanatics, they have a number of wealthy bourgeois on a string who 
are willing to pay, and they have no expenses themselves the 
whole year through. If our friends were half as active as they, 
matters would never have deteriorated to such a point. From 
America Sorge and Dereure are coming, the others (the Woodhul-
lers) are sending 3, including a petticoat. All of us will come, 
of course. See to it that the Swiss spare no expense this time and 
that they are properly represented. Especially the Swiss Ger­
mans. 
Incidentally, we shall be launching a bombshell tomorrow 
evening which will cause no small panic among the Bakuninists. It

is a public statement about the continued existence of the Alliance 
de la démocratie socialiste as a secret society. 563 We have at long last 
received the necessary material and the proof of this from 
Spain 564 and are launching an attack without delay on the Spanish 
Federal Council, which has 5 members of the Alliance on it." The 
Emancipation in Madrid opened fire last Saturday weekb  and 
there should be quite a battle. Of course, you will receive a copy 
for the Egalité without delay. Those swine imagined that with 
their secret organisation they could direct the entire International 
from Locarno. 0 But this revelation will break their necks, and if 
Switzerland and Germany exert themselves just a little bit so that 
the Alliance people do not get a majority after all through the 
negligence of our friends, then the whole bubble will burst and we 
shall have peace and quiet at last.

him—the same man who was the manager in the Nechayev

instead of giving work, sent or had sent to Lubanin (I think)d who 
transacted for the publishere with him the affair, a most infamous 
and compromising letter.574  It would be of the highest utility 
for me, if this letter was sent me immediately. As this is a 
mere commercial affair and as in the use to be made of the

However, Mr Lachâtre forgot to let me have Mr Lahure's address, 
which is why I am writing you this note. 
Last week I despatched to Mr Dervaux, at the last address he

manuscript of Section II. He has not yet acknowledged receipt. 
On Monday lastb I sent him the final proof of instalment 6, 
which I had marked ready for press (after having made the few 
corrections indicated). 
I hope that everything has reached the publisher's. If you have 
received No. 6 and made the corrections, I authorise you, as 
requested by Mr Lachâtre, to print instalments 1 to 6 straightaway. 
Perhaps you would be good enough to reply by return of post.

ENGELS TO E. GLASER DE WILLEBRORD 575 
IN BRUSSELS 
[Excerpt from a letter] 
[London,] 19 August 1872 
As you will already know, victory is now ours. The Italians, 
self-styled Internationalists, have held a Conference at Rimini576 at 
which the representatives of 21 sections resolved that: The 
Conference, etc., etc. 
It would be advisable to publish this immediately, in the 
Internationale and the Liberté. Bakunin, whose style is detectable 
throughout the document, realising that the game was up, has 
beaten a retreat all along the line and, with his followers, is leaving 
the International. Bon voyage to Neuchâtel. 
But what is even more absurd is that, of the 21 sections which 
claim the right to convene an International Congress, only one, 
that of Naples, actually belongs to the International. The 
remaining 20, in order to safeguard their autonomy, have 
repeatedly abstained from taking any of the steps prescribed by 
our General Regulations as conditions of admission. Their 
principle is 'L'Italia farà da sè'a; they constitute an International 
outside the International. The three other sections which maintain 
relations with the General Council—Milan, Turin and Ferrara— 
did not send delegates to Rimini. 
Thus,  in addition to the Conseil fédéraliste universel* 11 constituted 
by societies which do not belong to the International and, for that 
very reason, claim to control it, we now have an anti-authoritarian 
Congress convened by societies outside the International and 
claiming to make laws for it. 
For the rest, this has happened just at the right moment to open 
the Spaniards' eyes; in that country we have succeeded in enticing 
the fox from his lair. We have forced the Alliancists themselves to 
publish the Rules of the 'eminently secret' Alliance.10 The present 
(Spanish) Federal Council, with 5 Alliancists out of 8 members, 
has been unmasked and publicly denounced as perfidious to the 
International. Everywhere the struggle has broken out between 
a 'Italy will cope on her own' (the device of the Italian independence fighters in 
1848-49).

Alliancists and Internationalists. The oldest  TRADE UNION  in the 
world, that  of machine-spinners  and  weavers  in Catalonia, 40,000 
strong, 5 has  come  out in  support  of us and  sent Mora,  who is one 
of us, to the  Congress450 because, according  to his  mandate,  he 
knows better than anyone else what  the  Alliance  is like."  The 
Rimini resolution will  put  paid  to the  Alliance  in Spain. 
The Danes  are  sending  two  delegates;  the  Germans  5 or 6 at 
least. Sorge  and Dereure  are on  their  way  from America;  the 
schismatics there want  to send three. 
Lafargue  is coming with  a mandate from  the  Portuguese. 
Another advantage  is that  the  Congress will henceforth  be free 
of public rumpuses. Everything will  go off  decorously  in front  of 
the bourgeois public. 
As for the  Neuchâtel Congress,  it will turn  out to be  nothing 
more than  a meeting  of the  Jura Federation,  in company with  a 
few Italian sections,  and  hence  an utter fiasco. 
At last  all is  going well,  but we  must  not  allow this  to lull us to 
sleep.  If the  Internationalists  do their duty,  the  Hague Congress 
will be a  great success;  it will establish  the  organisation  on a  sound 
basis  and  will once again enable  the  Association  to develop 
internally  in a  peaceful manner while confronting  its external 
enemies with renewed vigour.

permission. 
We learned today that the Jurassians will be coming to The 
Hague450 after all, but that they will withdraw after the first 
resolutions against the Alliance10  and will then hold their own 
congress in Neuchâtel. Bakunin seems to have been premature 
with his instructions to Italy; the Spaniards will have shown him 
that things cannot be dealt with in such a way and that they would 
have to go to The Hague, if only to protest. The situation is that 
the Spanish Federal Council has an Alliance-majority and has 
operated an electoral procedure which makes it probable that they 
will send 4 Alliance representatives. 579 In contrast, the union of 
the (40,000-strong) Catalan factory workers577 will send Mora, a 
supporter of ours.3 The Italians will take good care not to show up 
after their Rimini resolution.576

About April last a knot of men clubbed together, pretending to 
represent a few societies which nobody knows, and adopted the 
grandiloquent name of Universal Federalist Council of the 
I.W.M.A. and of the sections adhering to it.417 Not one of the 
societies they pretended to represent belonged to the Internation­
al. Not one of themselves belonged to it, on the contrary, two of 
them had been expelled from it. But this was the very reason why 
they claimed the right to supersede the then existing General 
Council and to [take the] direction of the International into their 
own hands. A circular of that General Council held them up to 
the ridicule of Europe and they were silent for a time. Now these

which nothing was decided, 2. motions that were not accepted, 
3. one or two motions on procedural matters which were 
adopted and, having been put into effect at the Congress, are 
now disposed of. All these will go into the minutes and are of no 
interest to you. 
It occurs to me that perhaps you do not have 
5. Lafargue's proposal for international TRADES UNIONS, so I have 
translated it from the Spanish and enclose it herewith. 
As soon as we have received the report you promised on the 
mandate debate (which, as you know, was not minuted, owing to 
the stupidity of the President, who failed to have secretaries 
nominated), the resolutions will be officially compiled and 
published.588 
Lucain took the Commission's papers with him to Brussels and 
is now sorting out the statements of the witnesses. As soon as we 
receive from him the papers, promised to us by the end of the 
month at the latest, all the evidence about Bakunin and the 
Alliance will be compiled and printed. We have now received some 
more very nice material, which could not be laid before the 
Commission because it arrived too late. 
Next, the minutes of the Congress for publication.589 
For the correspondence with Germany, Italy, etc., I enclose all 
the addresses known to me.

Hales raised hell in the Federal Council here, proposing a 
motion of censure against Marx because he had said that the 
English workers' leaders had been sold down the river—but a 
local English and an Irish section have already protested, saying 
that Marx is in the right. The whole crew—Hales, Mottershead, 
Eccarius, etc.—are furious that the General Council has been 
taken out of their hands. 590 
Guillaume has said in Brussels to Wilmart (who has passed it on 
to us in writing) that the Spaniards would re-establish the Alliance 
since it was now more necessary than ever. 
West is still stuck here—no money for the return journey. 
Give my warmest regards to Cuno and tell him to keep in touch 
with me wherever he might go. Best wishes,

The Dutch say that the main reason they voted with the 
minority was that they want to be reunited with Belgium and 
hence have to oblige the Belgians! 
Hepner has been arrested and threatened with 4 weeks gaol

the International on his own initiative! 
Resolution approved at the first public session: 
The Congress of the International Working Men's Association, assembled at 
The Hague, expresses in the name of the world proletariat its admiration for the 
heroic fighters for the emancipation of labour who fell victims of their devotion, 
and sends fraternal and sympathetic greetings to all those who are at present 
persecuted by bourgeois reaction in France, Germany, Denmark and the entire 
world.

I propose that all powers granted by the General Council, the councils, 
committees and sections in the countries where the International is banned should 
be cancelled and that the General Council alone should have the right to nominate 
representatives in those countries. 
(Proposed by A. Serraillier and 7 other French delegates and 
adopted on Saturday.) 
The Lafargue motion was passed unanimously on Saturday 
morning. However, I have only a Spanish version which will not 
correspond exactly to the official wording. 
On behalf of the Portuguese Federation and the New Madrid Federation I 
propose: 
That the new General Council be charged with the special mission of organising 
international trade associations  (TRADES UNIONS). 
For this purpose it will, within one month of the conclusion of this Congress, 
draw up a circular which shall be printed and forwarded to all working men's 
associations whose addresses are in its possession, whether they are affiliated to the 
International or not. 
In this circular the Council will invite the working men's associations to form an 
International union of their respective trades. 
Every working men's association shall be invited to fix itself the conditions 
under which it proposes to enter the International Union of its own trade. 
The General Council is charged with unifying all the conditions put forward by 
the associations which have endorsed this idea and to draw up a general plan to be 
submitted to the provisional acceptance of all the working men's associations 
wishing to enter International trades unions. 
The next Congress will then formally ratify the project. 
(Supported by 10 others and passed unanimously without 
debate.)

Art. 7a of the General Rules, adopted Saturday morning by 28 
to 13 (including abstentions), i.e. with more than a two-thirds 
majority.— 
In its struggle against the collective power of the propertied classes, the working 
class cannot act as a class except by constituting itself into a political party, distinct 
from, and opposed to, all old parties formed by the propertied classes.—This 
constitution of the working class into a political party is indispensable in order to 
insure the triumph of the social revolution, and of its ultimate end, the abolition of 
classes. The combination of forces which the working class has already effected by 
its economical struggles, ought, at the same time, to serve as a lever for its struggles 
against the political power of its exploiters. The lords of land and the lords of 
capital will always use their political privileges for the defence and perpetuation of 
their economical monopolies, and for the enslavement of labour. The conquest of 
political power has therefore become the great duty of the working class.

Dear Sorge, 
On vous taille de la besogne." Enclosed the French translation 
(because the wording can be done most literally in that language) 
of 2 articles from the Federation (Alerini's paper). b However, the 
Belgians are not really so terrifying. According to letters received 
subsequently they have already taken fright at their own boldness 
and do not know how to extricate themselves; in addition 
the disorganisation in the International in Belgium increases 
daily, which is very useful in view of the need to re-organise every­
thing. 
In contrast, you cannot simply ignore the resolutions of the 
Jurassians which, having been passed by a Federal Congress, 
amount to an open declaration of war.593  Le Conseil général est tenu

wrote off to Geneva at once for the latest Bulletin jurassien and 
shall send it to you as soon as it arrives. In addition, you could if 
you want write directly to the Comité Fédéral Jurassien (address: 
Adhémar Schwitzguébel, graveur, Sonvillier, Jura Bernois, Suisse) 
and ask for information. 
It is a very good thing that these gentlemen have openly 
declared war and thus given us a sufficient reason to show them 
the door. After this open declaration it is impossible for a majority 
of the federations to demand that the matter be brought before a 
Congress13  especially since at most 4 would vote in favour (they 
themselves, the Spaniards, Belgians and Dutch), while all the rest 
would be against. Swift, vigorous action against these eternal 
troublemakers is, in our view, very much in place as soon as you 
have the evidence in your hands, and will probably suffice to 
disperse the threatened Sonderbund. 595 
Yesterday I sent you Nos. 65, 66 and 67 of the Emancipation. 
The fact that Guillaume had told Wilmart in Brussels that 
the Spaniards would re-establish the Alliance since now, after 
the Hague Congress, it was more necessary than ever, was report­
ed by Wilmart himself in a letter to Lafargue (which I have read). 
I had intended to enclose the report on Spain, Portugal and 
Italy to the General Council0 but will not have it ready in time for 
the post. However, I do enclose my report to Section 6,596  which 
you can give to Bertrand. 
Here Hales has launched a colossal slander campaign against 
Marx and  myself,  but it is rebounding on him without our having 
to lift a finger.590 The pretext was Marx's statement about the 
corruptness of the English labour leaders. Some London sections 
and the whole of Manchester have protested most vigorously and 
Hales has lost his former majority in the  FEDERAL  COUNCIL, so that he 
will probably be thrown out entirely soon. 
That damned Lucain has still not sent us the papers about the 
Alliance that he took with him, so we are still unable to make a 
start/ The documents subsequently received from Switzerland give 
a full account of the Nechayev trial280 and include some Russian 
publications of Bakunin's. They are all highly interesting and will 
cause a fearful scandal. I have never seen such an infamous band 
of scoundrels in all my life.

You will, I am sure, excuse my long silence, which has been 
caused by an excessive amount of work. I have at last rid myself 
of the burdensome administrative business which devolved

tional and which, as the days went by, was becoming more

ress, 580 but after that I shall be able to dispose of my time more 
freely. 
The first series of Capital496 has been well done on the whole—I 
refer to those things incumbent upon the editor. However I was 
much shocked at the errata which it contains and which were not 
in the last proofs corrected by me. As an example I am sending 
you a bit from instalment II p. 16 which reads: 
'Ensuite nous avons vu que dès qu'il s'exprime dans la valeur, tous les 
caractères qui distinguaient le travail productif de valeurs d'usage 
disparaissent.'a 
In instalment II as published (p. 16) they have this totally 
meaningless sentence: 
'Ensuite nous avons vu que dès que le travail productif s'exprime dans 
la valeur, tous les caractères qui le distinguaient des valeurs d'usage 
disparaissent.' b 
There are other errors of this kind and I have sent a list of 
them to Mr Vernouillet, at the same time informing him that I 
shall pass nothing for press until I have in front of me the whole 
series of five instalments to be published. 
Mr Vernouillet has been good enough to send me Mr Maurice 
Block's pamphlet (extracted from the Journal des Économistes). 597 
Here we have a man of brains who doesn't even know what an 
'average' is, although he purports to have devoted his whole life to 
statistics! I wouldn't deny that there may have been a certain 
amount of ill-will on his part, but on the whole there is more 
stupidity in him than malice. 
The changes it was necessary to make in Mr Roy's translation 
have taken a great deal of time, but it gets better from the third 
section onwards. 
In Russia my book0 has proved an extraordinary success. As 
soon as I have a little more time, I shall send you some extracts 
from the Russian reviews.598 The Russian translation (in a fat 
volume) was published at the end of April ('72) and I have already 
been advised by Petersburg that a second edition will be appearing 
in 1873. 860 
At The Hague I found Laura very unwell and her health

characteristics that distinguished labour as a creator of use values disappear'; cf. the 
corresponding passage in Section 2, Chapter I of the authorised English edition of

labour finds expression in value, all the characteristics that distinguished it from use

Dear Lessner, 
Would you please give the enclosed letter3 to the Secretary of 
the FEDERAL COUNCIL tomorrow evening. If Hales then insists that it 
is necessary to write to Lisbon direct, without going through me, 
it would be best if you were to say no more than this: the matter 
should be dealt with speedily and so the best course to take would 
be to reply to me without delay; if Hales still wanted to discuss 
formalities and personalities, this would only show that he did not 
want any real work to be done, but merely wanted to waste the 
time of the FEDERAL COUNCIL and to sacrifice the interests of the 
Portuguese workers to his personal intrigues. If they demand that 
I should give them the Lisbon address, it would be best to say 
nothing for the time being; it will all work out.

ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 29 October 1872 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
Dear Cuno, 
Received your letter of the 8th and the minutes3; many thanks 
for both. 
The Bulletin jurassien, which you will have received, 0 and the 
Internationale of Brussels, which is going off today, will prove to 
you that we must really get down to it and that it is absolutely 
essential for Sorge at least to shake off his reservations and agree 
to an election 0 so that not just unity of action but above all action 
itself can be ensured. If we do not, without further ado, take 
energetic steps to suspend the Jurassians because of their Congress 
resolutions, which ride roughshod over the Rules and the Hague 
resolutions,593 and to expel the members of the anti-authoritarian 
Congress,599 in so far as they belong to the International at all, and 
to proclaim and justify such actions, then these people really will 
become altogether too cocksure. Time is still on our side: the 
Belgians are frightened by their own initial courage and are 
vacillating, in Spain the opposition to the Alliance people is 
growing stronger by the day, they are already calling for an 
extraordinary Spanish congress to examine the behaviour of the 
Federal Council and the delegates in The Hague—but all of this 
will go cold if the impertinent behaviour of the Jurassians is 
tolerated. And you can see from Hales' letter in the Internationale* 
that these men will do their utmost.600 Hales is the Jurassians' 
correspondent and distributes their Bulletin with its filthy articles 
here gratis to anyone who will take it and he sends it to all the 
sections. 
I must close now to catch the post. Marx and I are overloaded 
as never before with work on the Congress, preparing things for 
print, and with correspondence.588  Sorge will have received the

You must consider me an awfully cruel individual to think that I 
should be capable to poison, by malice  prepensée,  even with one drop 
of vinegar, the sweetness of your honeymoon. 603 If Mottershead or 
Guillaume said such a thing of me, I should not wonder, but you! 
Indeed I never thought that there was in one of the numbers that 
little entrefilet b about a certain great man' whom I better not 
name, and if I had seen it I should have kept the number back or 
used Russian censorship to tease you a bit. 
Your account of Oxford people only gives a sad confirmation to 
the sad fact that landladies are the same all the world over, indeed 
one does not know which are the worst, landladies or landlords. 
It's the difference of retail and wholesale which distinguishes the 
landlady of Stanhope House from the Marquis of Westminster,0 
the principle is the same.

Now the Lafargues are here601  and you no doubt now and then 
feel inclined to come over here, I hope you will recollect that there 
is always plenty of accommodation, both for you and for the 
Longuet of all Charlies, at our house, and he shall find a bed 
where he can stretch himself without laying crossways. And as I 
am on this subject, an idea strikes me. To-morrow night seven 
sharp we shall have the whole of your house, Lafargues and 
Ellen a and all, here for dinner, and would it not be a nice surprise 
if they found you here? I could not well write about this before, as 
the thing was only finally settled to-day, Mohr being so very 
uncertain on account of his hard work; but I know you're quite 
capable of making up your mind even to-morrow morning, and so 
I hope you will come. And as there are generally such things to be 
had as return tickets available for three or four days, you might 
stay a few days here, and perhaps Longuet finds time to come on 
Saturday to take you back on Sunday or Monday morning. If you 
leave by 2.30 train (if my old railway guide be still correct) you will 
be here in very good time, and indeed we might go across to 
Maitland Park b before dinner and see how they are getting on. I 
hope you will ruminate this suggestion to-morrow morning over 
breakfast and find it excellent. 
As to the purs, impurs and demipurs c604 I see very little of 
them, the purs are going to publish a pamphletd  containing 
all their grievances but it is still a mystery to me whether they 
will say much about us. At all events they are going to organise 
une société indépendente où toute tendence anti-révolutionnaire serait 
exclue.' 
Last Sundayf  Mohr delivered a lecture before the Knoten. 605 I 
brought a German chemical manufacturer, friend of Schorlem-
mer's g ('not unlike your brothers, but otherwise a typically 
easy-going son of the Palatinate', as Schorlemmer described him in 
his unsealed letter!) who permitted himself one or two objections 
but was pretty well rebuffed by Lessner and a few other working 
men. 
So I am counting on your innate energy to make a bold decision 
and come here tomorrow; that would be an enormous pleasure.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 2 November 1872 
122 Regent's Park Road 
Dear Sorge, 
Enclosed is my report on Spain.c 
I have just been asked to inform the General Council officially 
of the formation of the following two sections: 
1. Associazione degli opérai e degli agricoltori della Bassa 
Lombardia (Sezione di Lodi), Enrico Bignami, Via Cavour 19 
(secretary). 
2. Consociazione dei liberi Lavoratori Abruzzesi (Sezione di 
Aquila, in the province of the same name. Correspondence via 
Lodi for the moment). 
The announcement comes from Bignami, who also states that 
both have adopted Rules that conform to the General Rules. I shall 
ask for copies and send them to you.606 
Bignami is the only fellow in Italy to have taken our side, even 
though not very vigorously up to now. In his paper, La  Plebe,  he 
has printed not only my report on the Hague Congress0 but also 
a Lydia Burns - b Mary Ellen Burns - c  F. Engels, 'Report to the General Council of 
the I.W.M.A. upon the Situation in Spain, Portugal and Italy.' - d F. Engels, 'The 
Congress at The Hague (Letter to Enrico Bignami)'.

267. Engels to Sorge. 2 November 1872 445 
my much more outspoken private letter to him.a Since I have to 
send him news reports, the paper remains in our hands. In 
addition, he has had the General Rules reprinted with the Hague 
amendments and also my Congress report. He is surrounded by 
the autonomists and so still has to act circumspectly. 
I hear nothing from Turin any more. In Milan Cuno must 
find at least one contact for us so that we at least get reports. We 
hear from Ferrara via Lodi; the section was established by Big-
nami. 
Marx asks me to tell you that at the moment the minutes b are still 
absolutely necessary here. In view of the lies that Hales, 
Mottershead and Eccarius are spreading here, as well as those of 
the Jurassians, etc., on the Continent, it may turn out any day that 
we need to reply in the form of extracts from these minutes. For 
you, on the other hand, they can easily be dispensed with for the 
time being. We are making a copy of the parts with the 
administrative resolutions together with their motivation and shall 
send it to you. 
To be on the safe side I am again giving you the addresses for 
Spain, Italy and Portugal. If you have accepted the post, I think it 
is very sensible to have a single corresponding general secretary, 
who will only co-opt assistants for languages.60 
Best regards to you all.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 16 November 1872 
Dear Sorge, 
Your letter of the 25th crossed with mine of 2 November. Marx 
will have written to you since then. 
I gave a copy of the Address 610 to Serraillier in French and first 
of all to MacDonnel in English for the Irish. I next copied one out 
myself for The International Herald and lastly sent one to the 
FEDERAL COUNCIL. The fact is that I was 'very uncertain whether the 
FEDERAL COUNCIL might not suppress it or, alternatively, that they 
might not print it word for word with various mistakes in the 
English and strong Germanisms, so as to expose it to ridicule. I 
have,  of course, changed the latter since the Address was, as it 
stood,  quite unprintable either in English or French. We have 
always had such things corrected by some educated NATIVE. You 
will have to do the same as in official documents it is often not 
possible to make even grammatical alterations, and it is always 
fatal. For Hales and the Jurassians, etc., any mistake of that sort is 
in any case a source of amusement. 
Up to now the Belgians have not printed anything. 
You will have to send the Address to Australia yourselves; you 
will have had a visit from Harcourt in the meantime; I do not 
have any addresses in Australia.611 
Jones and Le Moussu have been warned. I shall see Serraillier

tomorrow and shall tell him to send you a report which, on 
account of Dereure, will have to dispense with both names and 
addresses—the latter he can send you privatim. More on Dereure 
below. 
The stamps420  cost about £1— Le Moussu did the design gratis. 
To print the Rules in English 3 cost around £12. 
I have already told you of the formation of two new Italian 
sections.15 The official letter now enclosed. 
I am sending you today: 
1 Emancipation and the manifesto of the Nueva Federation 
Madrilena612 
1 Egalité 
1 International Herald—report of the FEDERAL COUNCIL0 
7 Résolutions du Congrès de la Haye. 
The following matters to report in addition: 
1. Blanquists. They have issued a pamphlet: Internationale et 
révolution of which several copies per NEXT STEAMER. They 
announce their resignation from the International on the grounds 
that with the transfer of the General Council to New York it has 
committed suicide. They will found their own association and are 
already intriguing actively in France. It is therefore absolutely 
essential, firstly, that Dereure should not get hold of any addresses 
in France, and secondly, that he should say where he stands. Of 
course, this second point is only urgent if you consider it desirable. 
Serraillier will reply to this concoction in the Liberté and the 
Egalité. Ranvier has told Lafargue that the first draft was so full of 
personalities that he declared he would never put his name to it. 
He had never seen the second, published, version and his name 
appeared under it without his authorisation. He has quarrelled 
with them: they have had the audacity to put him on trial because 
he continues to belong to a refugee club called the Cercle d'Etudes 
Sociales 613 without permission, and he refused to submit to a 
schoolmasterly examination in the court set up by the purs (which 
is the name the Blanquists give themselves). As you can see, they 
are playing at Commune révolutionnaire in the same old way. You 
will be amused by their little pamphlet in which Vaillant in all 
seriousness presents all our economic and political ideas as 
Blanquist discoveries. They have already started to cause trouble 
a K. Marx, General Rules and Administrative Regulations of the Internatio­
nal Working Men's Association. - b See this volume, pp. 444-45. - c Presumably 
J. Hales' article 'Federal Council', The International  Herald,  No. 33, 16 November

in various places in France, apart from Paris where that tall man, 
Walter, is their agent. Although they are not a threat, they must 
not be given the means to stir up even more trouble, which is why 
Dereure must not have any addresses and why we must keep an 
eye on him. 
2. Spain. Matters are going splendidly here. The FEDERAL COUNCIL 
has had a long thing printed and circulated on the quiet.614 It 
contains 
a) a report on the Congress by the 4 Spaniards which is full of 
lies, 3 
b) the resolutions of the anti-authoritarians of Saint-Imier,599 
c) a motion from the Barcelona Federation to convoke a 
Spanish Congress on 25 December which would decide between 
the resolutions of The Hague and Saint-Imier, 
d) a request to all local federations to give their views on this by 
10 November. 
The Nueva Federation Madrilena replied to this with the 
manifesto being sent to you today. It objects to the submission of 
the Hague resolutions to any International assembly except for the 
purposes of consideration and implementation. (We have already 
sent the materials necessary to counter the lies of the 4 Spaniards to 
Madrid.) 
However, in order that the Spaniards should realise who actually 
rules them, the Jura Committee has already sent the Saint-Imier 
resolutions direct to all local federations in Spain with the request 
for their views on them; they have completely by-passed the 
Spanish FEDERAL COUNCIL. 
In the meantime, things have been happening in Spain. The 
federations of Gracia (industrial suburb of Barcelona) with 
500 members, of Toledo (200 members) and those of Badalona 
and Denia near Barcelona, have come out in our favour and 
against the Spanish Congress. In Valencia a large part of the local 
federation is on our side, as well as part of the one in Cadiz, which 
has already broken away from the old federation there. The sale 
of the Emancipation, which had been moribund and kept alive by 
money we had sent from here, is greatly on the increase once 
more (150 copies in Cadiz, Valencia and Gracia alone). In Gracia 
there was a large general assembly on 4 November. 615 The 
Barcelonese, with Alerini at their head, put their proposal forward, 
but as Mora (who is there) writes: 
a 'El Congreso de la Haya', La Federation, No. 162, 21 September 1872. 

=====第483页=====
268. Engels to Sorge. 16 November 1872 449 
'Despite all his shouting and gesticulating with his arms and his stick, Alerini 
was unable to convince these atheists that the Society of Jesusa had been acting 
well. So it was resolved to approve all the Hague resolutions and to censure the 
attitude of the Spanish delegates.'616 
Things are going well; if the worst comes to the worst we shall 
keep a very respectable minority in Spain which will part company 
with the rest and be of greater value than all the vague nonsense 
hitherto. However, it is quite possible that we shall smash the 
whole thing to pieces and throw the Alliance out. For all of this we 
have Mesa to thank, who has had to bear the brunt all on his own. 
Mora is feeble and at one point vacillated for a moment. Read the 
article 'Los medios de la Alianza', in Emancipation No. 71, to see 
how the Spanish FEDERAL COUNCIL attempted to win over Mora by 
INTIMIDATION.6'7 
3. London  FEDERAL  COUNCIL. Thanks to the slackness of the better 
people among the English, Hales and Mottershead have succeeded 
in gaining complete control of the FEDERAL COUNCIL. A mass of 
delegates from imaginary sections have momentarily provided 
Hales with a majority; he is secretary and treasurer all in one, and 
you can see from the report in today's International  Herald 618 that 
he is doing as he pleases. The only thing we can do is to hold the 
better elements together until those crooks clash with each other, 
which will happen soon enough. GIVE THEM  ROPE  ENOUGH  AND  THEY WILL 
HANG THEMSELVES. YOU will now be receiving The International Herald 
regularly so that you can see for yourselves how Hales is giving 
himself airs and acting as if he were the GENERAL COUNCIL. As soon 
as an opportunity presents itself—a breach of the Rules or 
something of the sort—and, as an intimate and correspondent of 
the Jurassians, Hales will provoke one soon enough, our people 
will split off and form a federation of their own, perhaps one 
together with the Irish. Unfortunately MacDonnel is leaving for 
America, but even so we have a very good successor to him in De 
Morgan, one, moreover, who travels all over England as a LECTURER. 
He is completely in the picture about the situation. 
In order to ensure here the desired publicity for your 
proclamations, etc., it would be good if the General Council could 
officially put me in charge of these matters for England. The 
FEDERAL COUNCIL undoubtedly suppresses as much as it can, and 
although Riley of The International Herald is an honest fellow and 
has left the FEDERAL COUNCIL in DISGUST, he is weak and somewhat 
dependent on the FEDERAL COUNCIL for the sale of his paper. So if I 
a i.e. the Alliance of Socialist Democracy 

=====第484页=====
450 268.  Engels to Sorge. 16 November 1872 
can show him a resolution to that effect he will be covered and will 
do everything. 
I leave it to you to decide whether you wish to send me plenary 
powers for Italy.619 In view of the struggle there, in which our 
people are in a tiny minority, swift intervention would be very 
desirable. I do indeed maintain my private correspondence with 
them and also write for the Plebe, but without plenary powers I 
cannot exert any influence on the sections, which, like the one in 
Turin, appear to be going to seed entirely and do not 
communicate at all, something which happens all too often in 
Italy. 
Marx is on a visit to Longuet and his wife in Oxford for a few 
days 620 so as to go through a part of the French translation of 
Capital^6  with Longuet. He will probably not be back before 
Monday." 
In my opinion you should in any case delegate plenary powers 
for France to Serraillier.621  This sort of correspondence can­
not possibly be conducted from over there; only, you should 
require him to send you monthly reports. You will not find anyone 
better; Dupont is too negligent unless he is spurred on daily 
and we frequently do not see him here for a fortnight at a 
time. 
As to the Jurassians, it is our view that the best way to proceed 
is simply to declare that they had disqualified themselves from 
membership of the International by the resolutions of their 
congress in Saint-Imier,*93  which contravene such-and-such articles 
of the Rules and Administrative Regulations, and then simply to 
notify the other federations of this fact. Incidentally, things are 
going badly for them. In Biel, where they no longer had a single 
member (see  Scissions* 3), a new section has been formed but it has 
affiliated itself to Geneva, and their model section in Moutier (see 
Scissions) has repudiated the resolutions of Saint-Imier. As you 
see, the Hague resolutions 580 are already bearing fruit every­
where. 
As for Germany, it would be good if Marx were to have plenary 
powers—just in case of emergencies with the Schweitzerians. 
All these are matters that you must consider. 
I am up to my eyes in work here. The fact that Mesa has started 
to translate the Manifesto has forced me to send him a revised 
version of the French translation from the Socialiste. 6ii The version

you brought with you in manuscript turned out to be very useful 
in this, as it is much better, although still based on Woodhull's 
English.609  I am taking the opportunity this -provides to put the 
French translation in order altogether. In addition I have articles 
to do for Volksstaat, Emancipation and Plebe; and as soon as 
Lafargue, who is now here, has found somewhere to live, we shall 
make a start on the Alliance business. 623 Lucain still has a lot of 
papers in Brussels and now writes that he will send them at the end

My dear friend, 
The letter sent over to me has been duly received and has done 
its work.574 
If I have not written earlier, and if, even at this moment, I do 
not send but these few lines, it is because I want you to send me 
another—if possible—strictly commercial address under which I may 
write to you. 
In consequence of the extradition of Nechayev624 and the 
intrigues of his master Bakunin, I feel very anxious on your behalf 
and that of some other friends. Those men are able of every 
infamy. 
I cannot enough express ray gratitude for the interest taken in 
my work and labours by you and other Russian friends. 
Yours most sincerely

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 7 December 3 1872 
Dear Sorge, 
Today I am sending you the Emancipation 76, The International 
Herald 36 and the Blanquist pamphlet, b which is quite unobtainable 
here and which I was only able to acquire this morning in a 
roundabout way. Serraillier has written off in answer to the Liberie 
in Brussels and the Egalité in Geneva, but those jackasses from 
the Égalité say it is too personal and refuse to print it! 
On 3.12. I sent you the Emancipation 74/75, the Plebe 117 and 
The International Herald 33-35. 
MacDonnel sailed for New York on Wednesday, I gave him a 
few lines for you.45 If the Fenians there625 should still mistrust 
him, you would be doing a service if you could reassure them; he 
helped us here very ably and quite selflessly. 
1. Holland. Van der Hout arrived here the day before yester­
day; the Dutch bourgeois will give him no more work, so he wants 
to look for some here. He says that the Jurassians had invited the 
Dutch Federation to a new separatist congress. 595 Whereupon they 
held a Dutch congress626 at which they resolved: 1. to stand by the 
General Council, 2. to send a delegate to the separatist congress, 
but only to report, not to vote, 3. not to recognise any congress 
but the legitimate one of September 1873 and only to put their 
complaints, etc., to it. So this amounts to the divorce of the Dutch 
and the separatists. 
2. Spain. You will have seen from the Emancipation that all is 
going well there. Apart from those known to you, Lérida, the new 
federation of Cadiz, a large proportion of the Valencians and Pont 
de Vilumara have come out against the Federal Council. After the 
Spanish Federal Council directly contravened both the General 
and the special Spanish Rules by convening a congress in Cordoba 
on 25 December" to choose between the resolutions of The Hague 
and Saint-Imier, the New Madrid Federation announced that the 
Federal Council had forfeited its mandate, and is calling for the 
a In the original: 'September'. - b  Internationale et révolution 

=====第488页=====
454 271. Engels to Sorge. 7 December 1872 
election of a new provisional Federal Council.62 This decisive step 
will soon clarify the position. In the meantime, a section of our 
people in Spain, above all the Catalan factory workers, think that 
the issue should be fought out at the congress in Cordoba, and so 
will not join in for the present. The Alliance people are hurrying 
matters along so as to have a majority in Cordoba and they will 
most probably succeed in their aim, after which the Catalans will 
formally come over to us. 
3. France. Despite the intrigues of the Jurassians and the 
Blanquists things are going well in the South, where there will be a 
congress in the next few days which will endorse the Hague 
resolutions and will probably issue an address to the General 
Council.628 However, they demand that there should be someone 
here with plenary powers who can also delegate temporary powers 
for France. There is a whole pile of money to be raised which can 
only be collected by a fully authorised agent on the spot. 
Larroque, our best man in Bordeaux, is now asking Serraillier and 
myself to grant him such authority to collect monies there, and I 
think I am justified in doing so by virtue of the money-raising 
powers conferred on me, until such a time as this is confirmed or 
cancelled by the General Council. Since it is vital that there should be 
somebody at the congress I have just referred to who does have 
some sort of authority emanating from the General Council, I am 
taking it upon myself to issue it to him,a  and if you disapprove you 
should inform me at once so that it can be withdrawn without 
delay.—Lyons is the only place where the Jurassians have some 
support, thanks to the indolence of the Genevans, but otherwise 
they have only individuals on their side. You will have seen that 
the Bulletin jurassien has taken the side of that policeman, 
Bousquet, and has declared him to be a man of honour. 629 
4. England. The opposition to Hales is growing. Murray, Milner 
and Dupont have come onto the FEDERAL COUNCIL and will be joined 
by others. Riley has declared that he no longer wishes to have The 
International Herald as the official organ of this FEDERAL COUNCIL 
and, as you will see, the relevant part of the title has disappeared. 
However, it will probably be a while before the swindle finally 
collapses. The Hague resolutions' 3 will appear in the next 
International  Herald,  as will also some reports by us on the course 
of events in the International.630 
We do not even have a complete set of the minutes.0 Hales still

has some. It would be a very good thing therefore if you could 
authorise Marx to take possession of all the papers belonging to 
the International and/or the old General Council, and particularly 
the minutes.651 
A letter of authority for Serraillier for France is absolutely 
indispensable,6  ' unless you want everything to fall apart once 
more. Serraillier is continuing to conduct his correspondence 
energetically and we are finding the money for him to do so, but 
he is nothing but a private individual as long as he has not received 
proper authorisation; and for all their autonomy, the French do 
want to be directed by someone who has been duly authorised by 
the General Council. We have nobody else but Serraillier for the 
job here; Dupont is much too unreliable for such an extensive 
correspondence and is too busy with his patent.

MARX TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 165 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
[London,] 12 December 1872 
Dear Friend, 
From the enclosed you can see the results of the Hague 
Congress.632 I read out the letter to Lyubavin 574  to the Commission 
d'enquête 0 on the Alliance 584 in the strictest confidence and without 
divulging the name of the addressee. Nevertheless, the secret was 
a Lydia Burns - b of enquiry 

=====第490页=====

not kept, firstly because the Commission included Splingard, the 
Belgian lawyer, among its numbers, and he was in reality no more 
than an agent of the Alliancists; secondly, because Zhukovsky, 
Guillaume et Co. had already earlier—as a preventive measure— 
recounted the story all over the place in their own way and with 
apologist interpretations. This was how it came about that, in its 
report to the Congress, 3 the Commission was compelled to pass on 
the facts relative to Bakunin that were contained in the letter to 
Lyubavin (of course, I had not revealed his name, but Bakunin's 
friends had already been informed on that score by Geneva). The 
question that presents itself now is whether the Commission 
appointed by the Congress to publish the minutes (of which I am 
a member) may make public use of that letter or not? That is for 
Lyubavin to decide. However, I may note that—ever since the 
Congress—the facts have been going the rounds of the European 
press,  and this was none of our doing. I found the whole business 
all the more distasteful since I had reckoned on the strictest 
discretion and solemnly demanded it. 
As a consequence of the expulsion of Bakunin and Guillaume, 
the Alliance, which had control of the Association in Spain and 
Italy, has unleashed a campaign of vilification, etc., against us 
everywhere. It is joining forces with all the disreputable elements 
and attempting to force a split into two camps. However, its 
ultimate defeat is assured. Indeed, the Alliance is only helping us 
to purge the Association of the unsavoury or feeble-minded 
elements who have pushed their way in here and there. 
It is a fact that Bakunin's friends in Zurich have tried to murder 
poor Outine. Outine himself is in a very critical state of health at 
the moment. This scurvy deed has already been reported in a 
number of papers belonging to the Association (including the 
Emancipaciôn in Madrid 13) and will figure in detail in our official 
Compte rendu of the Hague Congress. 633 The same scurvy gang has 
made two similar attempts on the lives of their opponents in 
Spain. Its misdeeds will soon be exposed to the view of the world 
at large. 
The fate of our dear  'MUTUAL  FRIEND'  C has been of the very greatest 
interest to my entire family. I have a plan to obtain help for him 
from Constantinople—through diplomatic channels.63 It may 
work.

I am eagerly looking forward to the promised review (in 
manuscript),635 as indeed to anything printed you have in this LINE. 
One of my friends wants to write something on the way my bookb 
was received in Russia. 
The publication of the French translation436 has been inter­
rupted by unpleasant ACCIDENTS, but will be resumed in a few days. 
An Italian translation is in preparation.636 
Lastly, a request: My son-in-law, Dr Lafargue M.D. (a refugee), 
would—if possible—be happy to contribute to some Russian 
Review,  etc.  ; he could supply articles either on the natural sciences 
or on the state of affairs in Spain and Portugal (as well as 
France). 637 However, his circumstances would not permit him to 
do this gratis and he could only submit articles in French. 
I should very much like to see a copy of the book by  Prof. 
Sieber (Kiev) on Ricardo's, etc., doctrines of value and capital,0 
which also contains a discussion of my book. 
Yours very sincerely, 
A. Williams d 
In Volume II of Capital I shall, in the section on landed 
property, deal in great detail with the Russian form.638 
One last point. I would like to publish something on Cher-
nyshevsky's life and personality, etc., so as to create some interest 
in him in the West. 9 But I need information for it.

IN HOBOKEN 
London, 14 December 1872 
Dear Sorge, 
I confirm my letter of the 7th inst.a  and am sending today 1 
copy of the Emancipaciôn with the article on Bakunin 640 
containing information you too will not have had, and The 
International Herald with the Congress resolutions.0 That jackass 
Riley has left out the voting figures. 
In Lodi, No. 118 of the Plebe, which contained your Address, 
has been confiscated and Bignami, the editor, has been arrested.641 
It looks as though the Leipzig high treason trial274  may be about 
to repeat itself there. We shall, of course, make as much capital as 
possible from the affair; it will appear at once in the Volksstaat and 
the Emancipaciôn 642 as proof of whom the governments regard as 
the greater threat: the General Council and its adherents or the 
Alliancists. It is the best thing that could have happened to us in 
Italy. 
You should have some brief reports on the meetings of 
the General Council printed in the Oestliche Post and in the Ame­
rican press, and send the relevant issues to the Volksstaat, Ega­
lité and The International  Herald,  as well as one or two copies 
here,  so that we can use them for Spain and Italy as well as 
for the French sections; the Danes and Dutch would also print 
them. 
The letter of authority for Serraillier becomes more urgent 
every day.621 The Jurassians on one side and the Blanquists on the 
other, are burrowing away all over France and are making  progress 
while Serraillier is already starting not to receive replies from 
various quarters anymore because he can only write as a private 
individual. If you continue to delay out of consideration for 
Dereure, who has been more than suspect since the resignation of 
the Blanquists,604 or for any other reason, we shall lose the greater

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 137 
IN HOBOKEN 
[London,] 21 December 1872 
Dear Sorge, 
Just a few words in great haste. 
The ostensible majority on the British Federal Council (consist­
ing to a very large extent of SHAM SECTIONS numbering a few 
individuals and founded by that scoundrel Hales merely for the 
purpose of sending delegates) has SECEDED from the minority 
(which alone represents the large English sections in London, as 
well as in Manchester, Birkenhead, etc.). 643 The fellows secretly 
put together a circular to the Federation3 (will be sent to you), 
(dated the 10th of this month), in which they summon the sections 
to a congress in London to make common cause with the 
Jurassians, with whom Hales has kept up contact ever since The 
Hague. 
Our people—who now constitute the only legal Federal 
Council—at once sent out printed postcards to all the sections, 
advising them to delay any decision until they had received their 
counter-manifesto, to consult about which they all assembled in my 
house yesterday (to draw up the main points). You will get it 
a 'To the Branches, Sections and Members of the British Federation of the 
International Working Men's Association'.

without delay.3 It will be printed at the beginning of next week. 
They will also adopt a formal resolution to recognise the Hague 
Congress580 and the General Council. 
At the same time Engels, at the request of one of the 
Manchester sections, has prepared for them a reply b to the 
circular of the scoundrels (who include among their number that 
vain idiot Jung, who has been unable to stomach the removal of 
the General Council from London and who has for a long time 
now been Hales' TOOL). They will receive it in their meeting today 
and will print it without delay. 
My view is that you should confine yourselves to the role of 
observers as much as possible for the time being, and leave the 
battle to the sections on the spot. In the meantime of course 
circulars like the one to Spain that I found in the Emancipaciân c 
i 644 
are very good. 
Apropos. On my advice The International Herald and its 
proprietor, Riley (a member of the Federal Council), have gone 
independent.630  We shall probably agree a contract whereby we 
shall publish our own international supplement to it once a week. 
I am sending you a copy today in which Engels and I open a 
polemic against Hales et Co. d 
As for Poland, your letter cannot be sent there. The old General 
Council was only able to obtain Poland's accession on the condition 
(essential, given the situation in the country) that it dealt exclusively 
with Wroblewski, who lets us know what he thinks would be 
appropriate or necessary. 
In this situation you have no choice. You must grant Wröblewski 
the same unlimited authority as we did, or else renounce Poland's 
membership. 645 
Because of the French translation,436 which makes me more 
work than if I had to do it without the translator, I am so 
overworked that I have not been able to write to you, as I have 
wanted for such a long time. 
Cuno has promised to provide details of the meeting of the 
Committee of Enquiry in The Hague.584 Tell him that if he does 
not do so immediately, we cannot wait for him any longer and that 
his personal honour is at stake in the matter.

When Hales sends his reply, the best thing will be to 
communicate it at once to me so that his letter and our reply may 
appear together in the same number.647 At the same time, you 
would then do well, to state in an editorial remark that after the

ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER 649 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 30 December 1872 
Dear Hepner, 
[...] and provides a direct refutation of Sybel,a in such a way, 
moreover, as presupposes independent and quite accurate thought 
of his own. Both Marx and I were delighted with the article,*1 even 
though it contains minor inexactitudes here and there. Of course, 
I was not in a position to know what Schramm is like otherwise, 
but he certainly knows his economics. 
4. In contrast, of the two articles on the 'Revival of the Reform 
Movement',0 the first is good, while the second is in direct conflict 
with the facts. The many wretched little congresses, which are 
taken seriously in this article only because they are taken seriously 
by The Bee-Hive, which has sold out to the bourgeoisie, have no 
other purpose than as preparations for the impending parliamen­
tary elections. All the reform leagues listed in the article are of 
absolutely no importance and, moreover, consist, for the most 
part, of the very same people. And what people? With a few 
exceptions, they consist of the labour leaders whom Marx branded 
as corrupt at The Hague!590 It is impossible to judge the 
movement here from over there, taking The Bee-Hive and 
Reynolds's as your guides. The fact that a few  TRADES  UNIONISTS  attend 
such congresses does not mean that the  TRADES  UNIONS are thinking 
of becoming political, which they (at least most of them, including 
the biggest ones) couldn't do at all without totally revising their 
rules.  [...In]  reality the movement here is lousier than ever, as is 
only to be expected with such industrial prosperity. 
[...] Whenever we send [articles] or pamphlets to Spain, [Italy] 
or elsewhere, we regularly receive in return a number of copies of 
them, without our asking for them, and a further quantity is put at 
our disposal, as is indeed right and proper. The only administra­
tion that makes an exception here is that of the Volksstaat. I had to

buy a copy of my Peasant War3  myself.  As for my Housing Question, 
I see Part I announced daily in the Volksstaat, but do not have even 
a single complete copy here to enable me to reply to Miilberger, b 
since Frankel had managed to mislay the copy of the Volksstaat 
which contained the concluding section, and the offprint sent to 
me had the last page missing! If Marx had not finally succeeded in 
finding his copy of the issue in question, I would have been quite 
unable to reply. I would put a lot of this down to sheer 
carelessness, e.g. the fact that a bill was sent to me for the copies 
of the Manifesto 0; but in the long run it is going too far, and if a 
stop is not put to this truly shoddy treatment of us soon, the 
Volksstaat will have no reason to be surprised if one fine day Marx 
and I simply go on strike. It just will not do for us to have to beg 
for free copies or buy from the bookseller our own things which 
we have let you have for nothing. People in other countries 
immediately send us copies of all pamphlets, etc., because they

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 4 January  1873 a 
Dear Sorge, 
1. Have received your letters of 3 and 6 December. Cannot 
understand why the papers, etc., should not have reached you. I 
wrote to you on 7 and 14 Decemberb  about the arrests in Lodi 
and sent: on 14 December Emancipaciôn and International  Herald; 
on 22 December Emancipaciôn and International  Herald;  on the 
23rd Emancipaciôn and Egalité (Cluseret against the Blanquists, 
which was good, though it was bad that his name appeared at the 
end 650) and on the 24th, 3 copies of the circular of the Manchester 
FOREIGN SECTION.0651  There follow today: Emancipaciôn and a further 
copy of the circular as well as the circular of the minority within the 
British Federal Council. d 
2. So the majority of the British Federal Council has seceded — 
under the leadership of Hales, Mottershead, Roach and—Jung.643 
They have issued a circular' and come out against the Hague 
Congress, etc. Up to now we have only a single copy, but as soon 
as we obtain another you shall have it. So it was not the BRITISH 
FEDERAL COUNCIL but this HOLE  AND  CORNER MEETING of the majority that 
called for an English congress on 5 January.652  However, organis­
ing a coup d'état among the English workers is not such a simple 
matter. The minority continued to assemble in its old meeting-
place at 7 Red Lion Court, it constituted itself the BRITISH FEDERAL 
COUNCIL and advised all sections not to make up their minds until 
a 1872 in the original. - b See this volume, pp. 453-55, 458-59. - c  F. Engels, 'The

they had heard from it. Immediately after this, as early as 
23 December, the circular of the Manchester FOREIGN SECTION, 
which I had drafted, was despatched, and this was followed on 
31 December by that of the minority of the FEDERAL COUNCIL. In the 
meantime, the West End SECTION here had declared its opposition 
to the majority, Nottingham followed suit, even before the circular 
of the minority had reached it, ditto Middlesborough, which 
immediately removed Jung from office and requested the minority to 
propose a new delegate for them, ditto the Manchester DISTRICT 
COUNCIL. All declared themselves to be in favour of the Hague 
resolutions, and according to private information of Riley's, we can 
be sure of all the provincial sections, with the exception of 
Liverpool. So that would put paid to this coup d'état. I am 
particularly pleased by the prompt justice meted out to Mr Jung. 
It serves him right for following in the wake of Hales and allowing 
himself to be used as the tool of his mortal enemy Guillaume. He 
is now as dead as a doornail. 
2.a Belgium. The Belgian Congress s'est bien moqué du Conseil 
Général? They have declared that they want nothing to do with 
you and that the Hague resolutions are null and void. 653 Shall see 
whether I cannot send you more precise information on Tues­
day'; I do not have the paper with me here. 
3. The Spanish Congress6 will come to the same decision since 
our people did not send any delegates. Unfortunately, Mesa writes 
to me that many of our supporters are involved in the 
insurrection,654 and are in prison or in the mountains with the 
guerillas, which is especially disastrous just at this moment. 
4. So you now have 1. the Jurassians, 2. the Belgians, 3. the old 
Spanish Federation and 4. the present minority sections here who 
have gone into rebellion. We are now unanimously of the opinion 
here that there is no case for suspension here, but that the 
General Council should simply state that such-and-such federa­
tions and sections have declared the properly valid rules of the 
Association to be null and void, that they thereby place themselves 
outside the International and have ceased to belong to it. This will 
rule out any talk of a conference, which would still be a possibility 
in the event of a suspension. 
It is obvious that you can only proceed to such measures when 
you have the official documents in your hands. We shall procure 
them for you.

5. In Portugal all is in perfect order; Lafargue received a letter 
yesterday saying that I could expect to receive a longer one. 
6. Still no word from Denmark. I suspect that the Schweit-
zerians have used their Schleswig supporters there to kick up a 
stink. But there is no opening there for the Alliance. 10 
7. France. You will have received Serraillier's report. There have 
been numerous arrests in the South—37 people, 27 have been 
released again, some of our people are still imprisoned. In 
Toulouse, incidentally, a conference of our people was in progress 
at the very time of the arrests.628 
8. Italy. The families of the 3 arrested men and of the 6 who 
fled in Lodi641 are in the gravest need, and Bignami is 
bombarding me with letters asking for help, since the section has 
naturally been outlawed by the other Italian sections (of the 
Alliance). We have sent some money and have used our influence 
in Spain and Germany. The fact is, however, that not much can be 
obtained from there; people there have enough such expenses of 
their own. But something should be done in America. It is of the 
greatest importance that Lodi should be supported from outside, it 
is our strongest base in Italy, and the only reliable one, now that 
nothing more has been heard from Turin. As soon as these people 
can see that the International is something more than words, it 
will mean a serious blow for the Alliance, which uses all its money 
for printing, etc., and never helps people out. Lodi is much more 
important, and more can be done with less money there than with 
the Geneva jewellers' strike,655 on which Outine once again, as 
usual, makes the existence of the International there depend. In 
this respect, the Genevans resemble the Belgians: they never do 
anything and always demand everything. What we here and you 
there can do for the jewellers is a drop in the ocean and will not 
advance their cause—the days of the great Genevan strike656  are 
past and will never come back; until the internal affairs of the 
International have been put in order, we shall not have the means 
to carry out any strike. On the other hand, a colossal success can 
be obtained in Italy with half the effort or even less. Just picture 
the fury of the Alliancists when they suddenly read in the Plebe: 
Soscrizione per le famiglie, etc., etc. Ricevuto dal Consiglio Generale dell' 
Internationale, Nuovo Jork*—so-and-so-many lire, and the General 
Council suddenly provides the Italians with proofs of its existence 
in this form! So do what you can. The people have been put in 
a Subscription for the families, etc., etc. Received from the General Council of the 
International in New York

gaol because of your circular3  and so you owe it to them. You 
ought to be able to raise some $30-50, but however much or little 
it is, send them something and soon, if you like with assurances 
of possible further remittances. If we lose Lodi and the Plebe, we 
shall no longer have a pied-à-terre in Italy, of that you may be 
sure. 
9. We receive here at best 1 copy of most of the papers of the 
International and the Alliance, etc., and even then only with 
difficulty. However, we shall see to it that we procure them for 
you regularly. 
10. Your proclamations are very much  TO THE  POINT,657 but as long 
as you correspond in French with people like the Jurassians and 
the Belgians, and in English with Hales, you will risk having them 
print your things with all the linguistic errors and Germanisms, 
which would certainly not be pleasant. You must surely have some 
people whose mother-tongue is French or English and who would 
be in a position to look through these things. Our Frenchmen 
here would have raised hell if we had put their names to Marx's 
or my French. None of us can be so secure in a foreign language 
that he can produce a text for publication without having it 
knocked into shape by a native. Apropos, Mesa says that in your 
Address to the Spanish Congress you had in a sense acknowledged 
their right to sit in judgment on the Hague resolutions and had 
thereby compromised yourselves—since I have not seen the 
document (it will not come until the next Emancipacian) I do not 
know what truth there is in this. 
11. Serraillier does not know this Argaing either to whom you 
have sent a letter of authority.658 If he was recommended by 
Walter, then something is rotten. Walter is an agent of the 
Blanquists, and is involved in intrigues in Toulouse, Bordeaux, 
etc. The Blanquists, by the way, have slipped up badly with their 
manifesto; one by one they are all trying to worm their way back 
into the International. Moreover, Ranvier has dissociated himself 
from the whole business.604 
12. In Portugal they have a right of coalition, but not the right 
of association. So the International is not officially constituted 
there, but, since everything is shipshape, an authorised representa­
tive is not needed for the moment, and could only give rise to 
jealousy and dissension.— It would also be best to leave the Danes 
to themselves until we find out what is WRONG there.

MARX TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 165 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
[London,] 18 January 1873 
Dear Friend, 
I have received, together with your letter, Sieber,a Golovachev,b 
and 5 VOLUMES OF CKpeöimKi [Skrebitsky]. c I find it almost 
embarrassing for you to be put to such expense on my account. 
My warmest thanks! 
The operas also arrived duly and gave my daughter great 
pleasure. 62 She believed, however, that they had been sent by a 
Russian lady she knows, and now asks me to convey her thanks to 
the unknown giver. 
The 3uaHie [Znaniye]d had approached me directly earlier 
on with a request for contributions,663 but I have no time for 
such things. As for Lafargue, he will send a trial piece through 
637 
you. 
As to Chernyshevsky, it entirely depends on you whether I 
confine myself wholly to his scientific work, or touch on his other 
activities as well.639 In the second volume of my booke he will, of 
course, only appear as an economist. I am familiar with a major 
part of his writings. 
*As to the mutual friend/ you may be sure that if I take 
steps634—and I am still waiting for some informations [sic] on that 
point from Constantinople—they will be of such a nature as not to 
compromise him or anybody else. 
As to Lfyubavin] I should prefer suppressing that whole part of 
the enquiry to be published rather than expose him to the least 
danger. On the other hand, boldness is perhaps the best policy. 
According to something which B[akunin] has published in 
Switzerland, not in his name, but in that of some of his Slavonian

soon as circumstances will permit them to do so. The indiscretion of 
their accomplices at The Hague was intentional and, I suppose, 
was meant as a sort of intimidation. 
On the other hand, I cannot judge of the possible consequences 
of the publication, and, therefore, should wish our friend to 
communicate [to] me through you his resolution, after having 
again quietly reconsidered the case.*

in revising the translation is incredible. I would probably have 
had less trouble if I had done the whole thing myself from the 
start. And moreover, such patched-up jobs are always an amateur 
job. 
The last numbers of the Paris Économiste of last year contain a 
review of my book 3 by Blockb which demonstrates once again how 
completely bankrupt the theoretical representatives of the MIDDLE 
CLASS  are. 
With best wishes for the New Year, 
Yours very sincerely,

ENGELS TO EUGEN OSWALD 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 29 January 1873 
122 Regent's Park Road 
Dear Oswald, 
My wife3 and I thank you cordially for your kind invitation, but 
we are unfortunately not yet in a position to say whether we shall 
be able to take it up. My wife has again been plagued by all sorts 
of illnesses ever since Christmas; she is suffering from the 
after-effects of pleurisy, and so it is very doubtful whether she will 
be able to go out in the evening—it would be the first time for 2 
weeks. For my part, I have promised the German Workers' 
Society13s that I would, if required, put in an appearance at the 
meeting on Saturday evening and give a talk, and I shall be 
unlikely to hear before Friday whether it is due to take place this 
Saturday or the following one. 
When your children came yesterday afternoon I was just 
working with Marx on something that absolutely had to go off by 
the first post and so could not get away for a moment. My wife 
believes that Pumps0 delivered  'A SAUCY  MESSAGE'  instead of my words: 
TELL THEM TO GIVE OUR COMPLIMENTS TO MR AND MRS OSWALD, AND THAT WE ARE 
MUCH OBLIGED [tO them], BUT THAT I CANNOT JUST NOW TELL WHETHER WE CAN 
COME. If this is the case, you now know what happened. 
Our best regards to Mrs Oswald and to your sister. 
Sincerely yours, 
F. Engels

London, 1 February 1873 
1 Maitland Park Road, 
Haverstock Hill, N. W. 
My dear Fanton, 
I have decided to write to you about a matter concerning our 
friend Dupont. Since you left, he has been working steadily and 
conscientiously. He was lucky enough to find an honest and skilful 
German workman who has the necessary set of tools worth nearly 
£500 St., thereby enabling Dupont to set up a small workshop 
with him where they not only make instruments based on 
Dupont's invention, but also manufacture improved versions of 
old instruments. I have seen them at work. 
Unfortunately they have come to the end of their resources. 
Yesterday I obtained a loan of £8 St. for Dupont, but cannot be of 
greater help to him, since my disbursements for the French 
refugees 3 (more than £150 St.) have left me flat broke. This is a 
critical moment for their enterprise. 
I hope you won't abandon our friend. If you come to his 
assistance, I shall see to it that funds are made available to him 
only as and when they are needed for the work, which would go 
ahead under my supervision. 
With warm regards from all the family, 
Yours ever,

MARX TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 137 
IN GENEVA 
[London,] 11 February 1873 
Dear Becker, 
The second FASCICLE of the French translation3 has just been 
published.436 You will have received it, if it has not been 
intercepted, before the arrival of these lines. 
The German instalments to you and to others have obviously 
been intercepted. In a few weeks the whole first volume will 
appear396 and I shall have it sent to you through a bookseller. I 
would be grateful if you could acknowledge receipt. 
I can do absolutely nothing for Kostecki. 1. I am myself  IN HIGH 
PRESSURE, I have run myself significantly into debt on behalf of 
Messieurs les réfugiés français,' who, in consequence, do nothing but 
heap abuse on my head; 2. Mr Kostecki was by no means sent off 
because of me, far from it. He could not maintain himself in 
London and told me that he would go to Galicia and wanted help 
from the International; I told him that its coffers were empty, but 
added that something could possibly be done for him once he had 
arrived in Geneva. 3. All this took place long before the Hague 
Congress. Kostecki had taken his leave of me, but I met him long 
afterwards in the street in London and then heard nothing 
further. Since then everything has changed. Our ties with Galicia, 
where many Poles have gone from here since then, are active and 
in good order, and this is true also of other parts of Poland. So no 
new emissary is required. Moreover, Wroblewski thinks nothing of 
Kostecki, who is in general held in little regard by our Polish 
people. 
I shall be writing to you in the next few days about relations 
within the International.15

MARX TO FRIEDRICH BOLTE 666 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 12 February 1873 
Dear Friend, 
Up to now the first 8 instalments of the German edition of 
Capital have appeared.145 Since the last part will come out in two 
or three weeks as well, I shall send the whole thing off at once (i.e. 
from instalment 5) to you and other friends in New York. As for 
an English edition, this is no doubt assured now, as a result of the 
French version.436 Nevertheless, I look forward to it with some 
concern. The revision of the French translation is causing me 
more work than if I had done the whole translation  myself.  So if I 
am unable to find a completely competent English translator I 
would have to take the thing into my own hands, and the French 
edition has already prevented me—and, until I am through with 
it, will continue to prevent me—from working on the final version 
of the second volume. 
Engels and I will, as far as our time permits, contribute to both 
the German and the Federal paper. 667 
The secessionists in England—Mottershead, Huber, Roach, 
Alonzo, Jung, Eccarius & Co.— have in recent weeks repeated the 
farce of the London  UNIVERSAL  FEDERALIST  COUNCIL417 in the form of a 
so-called Congress of the British Federation.668  The gentlemen 
consisted only of themselves; two of them, Jung and Pape, had 
already been unseated by their sections, Middlesborough and 
Nottingham, and so did not even nominally represent anything. If 
you add all these HOLE-AND-CORNER SECTIONS together, which these 
people have invented, they will certainly not come to 50. With the 
exception of a small notice which Eccarius as a wage-slave of The 
Times managed to smuggle into that paper," the congress passed 
unnoticed, but will be exploited by the secessionists on the 
Continent. Jung's speech at the congress surpasses everything in 
its stupidity and infamy. It is a gossipy tissue of lies, distortions 
and idiocy. The vain fellow seems to have suffered a softening of 
the brain. That is the way things are and one just has to get used 
a [J. G. Eccarius,] 'An English International Congress', The Times, No. 27598,

to it; the movement wears people out and as soon as they feel 
themselves to be on the outside, they lapse into meanness and try 
and persuade themselves that it is someone else's fault that they 
have become scoundrels. 
In my opinion the General Council in New York has made a 
great mistake by suspending the Jura Federation.669 These people 
have already left the International by their declaration that the 
International's Congress and Rules do not exist for them; they 
have formed the centre of a conspiracy to set up a Counter-
International; following their congress at Saint-Imier5" similar 
congresses have taken place in Cordoba,627 Brussels653 and 
London, and lastly the Alliancists in Italy will hold a similar 
congress.6 ° 
Everyone and every group has the right to withdraw from the 
International, and when that happens the General Council has only 
to record their departure officially; it is not in any way its function 
to suspend them. Suspension is provided for where groups (sections 
or federations) merely dispute the authority of the General 
Council, or infringe one or another of its Rules or Regulations. 
However, the Rules have no article concerning groups which 
reject the organisation in its entirety—for the simple reason that, 
according to the Rules, it is self-evident that such groups no longer 
belong to the International. 
This is by no means a pure formality. 
The secessionists have resolved at their various congresses to 
convene a general secessionist congress to constitute their new 
organisation, which would be independent of the International. 
Such a congress is to take place in the spring or summer.671 
At the same time these gentlemen would like to keep a door 
open in case of failure. This emerges from the bulky circular of 
the Spanish Alliancists.614 If their congress is a failure, they reserve 
the right to attend the Geneva Congress,672 a plan which the 
Italian Alliancist Gambuzzi ... was naive enough to reveal to me 
back during his stay in London. 
So if the New York General Council does not alter its 
procedure, what will be the consequences? 
The Council will follow up its suspension of the Jura by 
suspending also the secessionist federations in Spain, Italy, 
Belgium and England. Result: all the riff-raff will turn up again in 
Geneva and paralyse all serious work there, just as they did in The 
Hague, and they will once again compromise the whole work of 
the Congress for the greater good of the bourgeoisie. The great 
achievement of the Hague Congress580 was to induce the rot-

476 283. Marx to Boite. 12 February 1873 
ten elements to exclude themselves, i.e. to leave. The procedure 
of the General Council now threatens to invalidate that achieve­
ment. 
These people do no harm when they openly oppose the 
International, the latter only benefits by it; but as hostile elements 
within the International they spell the ruin of the movement in 
all the countries where they have managed to obtain a foot­
hold. 
The work they and their emissaries cause for us in Europe can 
scarcely be imagined in New York. 
In order to strengthen the International in those countries 
where the struggle is chiefly being carried on, what is needed 
above all is vigorous action from the General Council. 
Now that the mistake has been made with the Jura, it would 
perhaps be best simply to ignore the others entirely for the time 
being (unless our own federations demand the opposite), and then 
to bide our time until the general secessionist congress, when we 
can announce that all its CONSTITUENCIES have withdrawn from the 
International, that they have excluded themselves from it and from 
now on are to be treated as alien and even hostile associa­
tions.  Eccarius very naively stated at the London hole-and-cor­
ner congress that they must make politics with the bourgeoisie. His 
soul has been longing to sell itself for some considerable time 
now. 
The news of the great misfortune that has befallen Sorge 3 has 
affected us very deeply. My very best regards to him.

284 
ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 673 
IN HUBERTUSBURG 
London, 12 February 1873 
Dear Liebknecht, 
Before I can give you a definite answer to the many questions in 
your letter, I must first know exactly what you mean by saying 
that 'the Volksstaat cannot become involved in International 
polemics at the present time'. 674 If the Volksstaat proclaims itself 
neutral in the International's war against the secessionists, if it 
refuses to explain these events clearly to the German workers, if, 
in a word, the Lassallean revolt is to be concluded by your shaking 
hands over and beyond the International and by your sacrificing 
the International and Yorck to the Hasselmanns, then our attitude 
to the Volksstaat will change fundamentally. So I must ask you to 
speak out frankly at once. 
About my book,a  negotiations are pending with Wigand and I 
would have to free myself from him before deciding on any 
alternative. But on the general issue of letting you have the rights 
to practically all our earlier writings gratis at the very moment 
when we are in a position to make money from them, I would ask 
you to bear in mind that we too need money, firstly in order to 
live, and secondly in order to meet the daily mounting costs of 
agitation, propaganda material, etc. The essays by Marx and 
myself will certainly be collected and printed, but at the moment 
we have no time to take care of it ourselves. I am even less in a 
position to distil the essence of Owen's works for you. In the first 
place I do not have the time and in the second, I lack the 
material—my collection of Owen's writings went astray in 1848-49, 
and these things are no longer obtainable.—At all events the 
Misere de la philosophie is being reprinted in Paris; as to the 
German translation, Marx is negotiating with Meissner about a 
complete edition of earlier writings and so can hardly just take out 
one of the largest works without further ado. And anyway, you 
have plenty of time before you get from the Utopia h to us; better 
look after the intermediate links first.

Furthermore, I cannot conceal from you the fact that our 
treatment at the hands of the 'Party' does absolutely nothing to 
encourage us to entrust even more of our writings to it. I have not 
been sent even a single copy of my Peasant War; I had to purchase 
the copies I needed for  myself.  I am not even consulted about the 
publication of the articles on the housing shortage,3 whether they 
should come out separately or together.504 When I asked for free 
copies of the Manifesto* for us and for the Workers' Society 
here 135—in recognition of their having reprinted it three times at 
their own expense—we were sent 100 copies together with the bill I 
have written to Hepner about thatc and now request once and for 
all that this boorish treatment should cease. 
I shall try and unearth a copy of the Utopia (in English), but it 
may be difficult as all the old popular editions were bought up 
long since. 
I must close here and regret that I am prevented by the need to 
catch the post from enclosing a few lines to your wife.d  Please be 
kind enough to make my excuses. Does your family still live at 11 
Braustrasse? We have only that address and the Volksstaat.

Looked at from this point of view, the biography of the man 
would become the history of the party of which Marx indisputably 
is the highest personification, and would be of great interest to 
French democracy. It is this consideration that would persuade me 
to lay aside my work so as to devote myself to a task that would 
take time and call for research, if it was to be worthy of its subject. 
But I cannot agree to set to work until I have received a further 
letter from you informing me of the conditions which, no doubt 
by an oversight, you omitted to mention in your letter of 14 
February.3

Would you be so kind as to hand the enclosed letter to 
Liebknecht 45 on your next visit to the Castle? 538 Up to now I have 
sent most letters for him to the office of the Volksstaat, because I 
did not know whether you still lived at 11 Braustrasse. Your 
enforced grass-widowhood must be increasingly burdensome to 
you as time passes. You really have a lot to put up with! At all 
events, however, you are still able to visit Liebknecht regularly, 
and if you do not think it too impertinent of me I would ask you 
to tell me how he is physically, what the treatment is like, whether 
he is limited to the resources of the Castle for food and drink, or 
whether he can supplement this from outside, and in general 
everything pertaining to his situation and Bebel's—he himself

writes very little about such matters, indeed recently he has 
stopped commenting on them altogether, and you will appreciate 
that all this interests us very much. Not only for the prisoners' own 
sake—our interest is also a little egoistic, since this is something 
that might happen to us too, one day, and we would like to know 
what we might have to expect. What is the position with regard to 
books? Can he have everything he needs—at least as far as 
scholarly and literary works are concerned—or is the censorship 
strict? I know of course that the pigeon-post, or THE UNDERGROUND 
RAILWAY as they say in America, is easily organised. 
I hope that you are in good spirits and that you and the 
children are in good health. IT IS  A LONG  LANE  THAT  HAS  NO TURNING, as 
the English proverb has it, and the TURNING cannot be very far away 
any more. And you may be sure that, however things turn out, 
you have friends here in London who take the warmest interest in 
Liebknecht's and your fate. 
If any of the children should remember me, which I very much 
doubt, since I did not live in London at the time,676 please give 
them my very kindest regards. 
With sincere good wishes, 
Yours truly,

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 20 March 1873 
122 Regent's Park Road 
Dear Sorge, 
First of all let me convey to you our heartfelt sympathies on the 
great family misfortune that has befallen you.b We have all had to 
endure similar losses and know how deeply they scar a person's 
whole life. It takes a long time and a hard struggle to overcome 
them, but we know that you have the strength to do so. 
Your last or rather your penultimate letter is in Marx's hands. 
He intended to drop you a few lines, but I doubt whether he has 
done so and cannot ask him today since he and Tussy have gone 
off to Brighton for a few days. As far as the minutes of the 
former General Council are concerned, they can be of no use to 
you, since you have already been notified of all the resolutions of 
general interest, and the others have lost all their validity. For us, 
on the other hand, they are absolutely vital in our struggle against 
the secessionists, if we are to be able to answer their lies and 
slanders. I think that the interests of the International are more 
important than the need to comply with a formality.—That the 
other secretaries0  have failed to send in reports is indeed 
irregular. The one from Serraillier was in the letter that went 
astray. Wrôblewski is unable to send one since everything in 
Poland is secret and we never used to ask for details from him 
a Mary Ellen Burns - b the death of Sorge's daughter - c the corresponding 
secretaries of the former General Council in London 

=====第516页=====

earlier either. How matters stand in Austria and Germany is 
something you know as much about as we do, since you 
correspond with people there directly and we do not have any 
further details about the position of the sections either. No report 
can be demanded from the secretaries who have resigned—Jung 
for Switzerland and Cournet for Denmark. So who else is left to 
report? We have not heard a word from Denmark, I am afraid 
that the Lassallean intrigues may have taken root there. 
In France everyone seems to have been caught. Heddeghem has 
been the traitor, as proved by the trial in Caen, where the 
prosecutor actually named him as the informer. Dentraygues in 
Toulouse (Swarm), with his accustomed pedantry, kept a mass of 
useless lists which have told the police all they needed to know. 
His trial is now in progress,677 we expect the reports any day. 
Larroque fortunately managed to escape to San Sebastian via 
London, from where he is attempting to renew contacts with 
Bordeaux. His address (to be kept secret) is: 
Sefior Latraque 
21, Calle de la Aduana, San Sebastian, SPAIN. 
No inner envelope is necessary. 
Cuno was out of luck with his resolution from Section 29. He 
sent it to the Alliancist Spanish Federal Council, adding that 
Capestro=Cuno! So why the comedy of names?678 The Federacion 
of Barcelona duly printed the stuff and concluded—not without 
some apparent reason—that Cuno too had repented and realised 
that the old General Council was in the wrong.3 That comes from 
mediating. 
Ad vocemb Lodi. When your letter of 12 February arrived, they 
had all been released and Bignami was reinstated as editor. So I 
took it upon myself not to send the $20, since money was no 
longer needed, particularly as the General Council needs its 
money  itself.  May I ask you for instructions by return of post 
about whether to send it or whether you wish to dispose of it 
otherwise/ 
As far as payments for the General Council are concerned, I 
have not yet received a penny. You will see from the Administra­
tive Regulations, III, Art. 4, that subscriptions do not fall due until 
1 March; the almost universal practice was for them not to be paid 
in until shortly before or at the Congress. Until then we lived

mainly from individual contributions and from credit. As to the 
former, I shall try to exact payments, but it will be difficult unless 
we wish to use up all the resources for the next Congress in 
advance and leave the course of the Congress itself to chance. 
Send 80-100 English-language trade-union plans at once.679 The 
40 that have been sent, like most of the letters, have not yet 
arrived—a search is being made—and 40 is not enough for here 
anyway; we could distribute 30-40 in Manchester alone, since the 
TRADES UNIONS here are mainly local and not centralised. For the 
moment you could send everything for the BRITISH FEDERAL COUNCIL 
either to me, or to S. Vickery, the secretary, at 3 Oak Villas, 
Friern Park, Finchley, N. London. Or to F. Lessner, 12 Fitzroy 
Street, Fitzroy Square, W. London. The present headquarters of 
the FEDERAL COUNCIL is itself only provisional. I could also use some 
copies of the French version for Italy, Holland and Belgium; I 
send them out individually or 2-3 at a time to strike committees 
wherever a strike breaks out. 
I cannot obtain any addresses in Holland or Belgium at the 
moment. Liebers is no longer in The Hague, but in Germany; van 
der Hout, who is an idler, by the way, is a  COAL  MINER near Essen. 
The resolution of 26 January3 is very  good. 680 All that is needed 
now to settle the matter is for you to pass a resolution after the 
conclusion of the Jurassian, Italian and other congresses which are 
due to be held in March in which the resolution of 26 January is 
applied to the secessionists in Spain, Belgium, England and the 
Jura by name. Italy could only be referred to in so far as 
recognised sections—Naples, Milan, Ferrara, Turin, Lodi, Aquila— 
might be affected by it—the others have never belonged to the 
International. 
The Address to the Spaniards681 will also have a very good 
effect. On the one hand, it is thoroughly correct from a theoretical 
point of view and, on the other, it avoids everything which might 
provide the Alliancists with a pretext to make an anarchis­
tic song-and-dance about it, and thirdly, it is  brief.  In general, 
all your Addresses have been received very well by the work­
ers. 
I have sent the resolution of 26 January to the BRITISH FEDERAL 
COUNCIL, where it will be presented this evening. 
The demands of the General Council (of 15 December) about 
the admission of sections will beyond doubt never be fulfilled in 
this manner. The General Council must admit every section that

fulfils the conditions of the Rules and Administrative Regulations. 
It cannot lay down any new conditions, so No. 1 lapses in part 
(the General Council is entitled to require the statistics of numbers 
and branches of work, but not names), and No. 4 lapses entirely 
since Section III of the Administrative Regulations provides 
otherwise for the mode of payment. The best thing would be just 
to drop this quietly—-we here have never obtained more than is 
prescribed in  Nos.  2 and 3, and even then only with difficulty, and 
where people acted reliably in good faith we were never strict 
about formalities. For doubtful cases, of course, it is good to have 
such a resolution behind one. 
It will be just as impossible for Wroblewski to stick to his 
instructions. The authorised representative for Poland must be

anything at all there, and a detailed monthly report from him is 
quite out of the question.— Quant à moi,* I can only report about 
Italy that there is nothing to report apart from the fact that the 
Lodi section has not yet reconstituted itself and the one in Turin 
has probably come apart at the seams. 
It really was an unfortunate idea to pass the  STAMPS  on to me.682 
Last year we did not receive them before March or April, now it 
will be even later. Le Moussu, like all Frenchmen, is bone-idle in 
business affairs, unless matters are really pressing, and even a 
good kick is of no avail. Formerly, Jung saw to the printing and 
that task too now falls to Le Moussu, who does not know any 
English. 
I have sent you The International Herald and the Emancipation, 
the former up to No. 50 (goes off today), the latter up to No. 88; 
I hope they have arrived safely. 
I had almost forgotten to thank you for the wine that arrived at

Marx, but have only tried a few bottles  myself.  The SWEET Catawba 
pleased the ladies very well. The red is not bad and the white I 
have tried so far is an interesting drink somewhere between hock 
and  DRY  SHERRY. The few bottles I still have in my cellar are being 
saved up for great occasions. The wine is pleasant to drink but 
lacks the individual character of the original European wines. I am

ENGELS TO MAURICE LACHÂTRE 683 
IN SAN SEBASTIAN 
[Draft] 
[London, after 21 March 1873] 
Citizen, 
In your letter of 16 March you appear to be under the 
impression that I am 'presenting you with a book on the 
communist party', whereas it was you who, by requesting me to 
write a serious biography of Karl Marx," asked for a history of that 
party. Marx has led an essentially active life and thus to recount 
his life would be to write the history of the philosophic and 
revolutionary movement, both German and international, since 
'42, in order to trace therein his personal participation and the 
influence of his writings. If you merely want a reporter's biography, 
that has already been done. L'Illustration has published one b and 
if you care to send me a copy I shall make the necessary 
corrections.684 
Since the study I had in mind was intended to be a serious 
work, I should have thought I would be doing you an injury by 
supposing that you who, in this business matter, have assumed the 
role of capitalist, would have wished to evade the prime social 
rule,  operative even in our bourgeois society, that the capitalist 
pays the workman in proportion to his labour. However, since you 
say you are increasing your Capital for the sole purpose of placing 
it at the service of the Community, I shall consent to donate my 
labour on condition that you set aside a sum for the foundation of 
a weekly international organ, of which the socialist party has a 
pressing need, and of which Marx would be editor.

MARX TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
London, 22 March 1873 
My dear Sir, 
You would much oblige me in giving me some information on the 
views of Tschitscherin, relating to the historical development of 
communal property in Russia; and on his polemics on that subject 
with Bjeljajew.685 The way in which that form of property was 
founded (historically) in Russia, is of course a secondary question, 
and has nothing whatever to do with the value of that institution. 
Still, the German reactionists like Professor A. Wagner in Berlin, 
etc., use that weapon put in their hands by Tschitscherin.686 At the 
same time all historical analogy speaks against Tschitscherin. How 
should it have come to happen that in Russia the same institution 
had been simply introduced as a fiscal measure, as a concomitant 
incident of serfdom, while everywhere else it was of spontaneous 
growth and marked a necessary phase of development of free 
peoples? 
Yours most truly, 
A. Williams3

I forgot to add when talking of the $20 not sent to Lodi that 
during their period of difficulties, those people had received the 
following:

from the Committee of the Social-
Democratic Workers' Party, 20 thalers 75 "

Dear Becker, 
If I do not manage to write to you in detail, you must put the 
blame on my overwork. I shall have no spare time available until

printed.436 As for the 2nd German edition," I was glad to send off

instructed Meissner to send you the whole-volume edition post-free, 
which is due out in about a week. 396 You would oblige me by 
letting me know when it comes. 
Engels asks you to forward the enclosed letter to Goegg 45 as 
soon as possible. It is to do with some information about the 
Alliance (we are at present engaged in assembling documentary 
evidence with which to demolish thema). Might I also ask you to 
send us, if at all possible, the first programme of the public Alliance in 
Geneva? in which your name appeared among others. 
We thought that the Égalité of Geneva must have folded up as 
we had not seen a copy since Outine's departure from Geneva. At 
his request I had induced some French friends to become 
correspondents for it, but our belief in its demise put a stop to 
everything. So if Perret wishes for reports from here, he must 
make sure that Engels (122 Regent's Park Road) and myself each 
receive a copy. We shall pay for it if he so desires. 
The General Council will likely decide on Geneva as the venue 
for the next Congress.672 You must even now start working to 
ensure a large attendance. This is all the more indispensable as the 
Alliancist band of rogues is planning to turn up en masse. Of 
course, they must not be allowed in. The Hague Congress580 must 
have brought us at least the one advantage that the rabble will be 
removed from our midst. But for that it is essential for us to have 
completely reliable local representatives at our disposal. 
With best wishes from the whole family.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 3 May 1873 
Dear Sorge, 
Have received your letter of the 9th and that of the General 
Council of the 11th. 
1. Serraillier. What Dereure says is utter nonsense.688  The priest 
story amounts only to this: Pottier, a delegate of the Commune in 
the 2nd arrondissement, to which Serraillier was assigned, hired out 
the churches to the priests (le dit délégué loue la boutique nommé 
Eglise, etc. etc. au nommé ... pour y exercer le métier de cure 3 was the 
formula) and Pottier collected all the money and used it for 
Commune and arrondissement business and credited it to the 
Commune. Serraillier never had a sou of it in his hands. Le 
Moussu, who rises to the word 'priest' like a hungry fish to the 
bait, actually intended to have Pottier and Serraillier arrested for 
this, because, as he expressed it, ceci était un commerce immoral} 1 
When it comes to bad jokes I am not sure who has produced the 
best one, Le Moussu or Pottier and Serraillier. But to base serious 
accusations on such childish grounds is worse than childish. 
However, the Frenchmen of today are children. What the 
demonstration of the 22 is supposed to be, I do not know; I 
suppose it was the attempted resignation of the minority. The row 
between majority and minority in the Commune is still going on 
and for everyone with a Blanquist taint it is still an offence even 
today, and a capital offence moreover, to have belonged to the 
minority. All this is ancient history for us here; we have heard 
every conceivable variation on that tune until we are sick of it and 
would not give a brass farthing for the entire story. 
2. Arbeiter-Zeitung —it must indeed be said that the uncouthness 
of its style could not be surpassed. However, that is American— 
the entire German-American press writes like that. For the present 
neither Marx nor myself have a single spare moment to write 
regular reports; I am up to my eyes in work for the Congress 
a the aforenamed delegate lets the premises, known as the church, etc., etc., to 
the person named ... for the purpose of carrying out the trade of priest - b it was 
unethical commerce

which is to be tabled in French3 and Marx is immersed in his 
French translation.436 
3. The Viennese. We know no more than has appeared 
publicly, since neither Oberwinder nor Scheu has written to us 
direct. 689 However, we have our suspicions about Scheu. 1. He is 
in touch with Vaillant and 2. there are signs that like his friend 
and predecessor, Neumayr, who has since gone mad, he is in 
contact with Bakunin. The echo of the latter's resounding phrases 
can be detected in Scheu's articles and speeches, and you will 
remember how his brother b disappeared from The Hague580 as 
soon as the business with Bakunin came to a head. Up to now no 
serious allegations against Oberwinder have been made, at least in 
public. His collaboration on bourgeois papers took place with the 
foreknowledge and approval of the party and directly served party 
purposes. If The Times were put at my disposal tomorrow and I 
could write what I wanted and receive payment for it, I would 
accept without hesitation. Nobody objected to Eccarius doing this 
until he reversed the situation and exploited the International in 
his own financial interests and no longer wrote in its interests but 
in his own and those of The Times. And since in Austria feudalism 
has only partly been overcome, the masses are still incredibly 
stupid and conditions are still about the same as those in Germany 
before 1848, we naturally do not take it amiss that Oberwinder 
does not immediately demand the moon with the maximum of 
radical hullaballoo, but instead pursues the policies we advocated 
at the end of the Communist Manifesto as being appropriate for 
Germany at the time. Here and there he may exhibit an excess of 
petty-bourgeois caution, but in the first place even that has not 
been proved and in the second, it is no cause for such a 
tremendous hue and cry. Moreover, Oberwinder is no Austrian 
and so could be deported at any time. But, as I have said, we do 
not know the details and so reserve our judgment. 
4. Admission requirements.0 —Even assuming that formally you 
are in the right to make all these demands on the individual 
sections (which is, however, very much open to doubt), up to now 
no Federal Council has ever imposed these bureaucratically precise 
conditions, and had it imposed them, they would never have been 
fulfilled. What a great mistake it was to make such requirements 
even in France is demonstrated by the article in No. 49 of the 
Neuer Social-Demokrat, 690 which I am sending you today. I

informed Hepnera straightaway and, having made precise en­
quiries yesterday about Dentraygues and Heddeghem, I have 
despatched the necessary statement to the Volksstaat* 
5. WE  EXPECT MORE NEWS ABOUT FRANCE BEFORE TAKING  ANY  STEPS.  I do not 
see that there are any steps you could possibly take. All our 
sections have been uncovered. Heddeghem was a spy as early as 
The Hague. Dentraygues is not, but for personal reasons and 
from weakness, he denounced some individuals who had previous­
ly beaten him up. A member who wanted to obtain some money 
for the party had given his watch to Dentraygues, asking him to 
pawn it. Dentraygues' wife did so and later refused to redeem it or 
even to hand over the pawn-TicKET. This caused a scandal. A few 
people—mainly bourgeois—got together, gave Dentraygues a 
thrashing and then denounced him to the public prosecutor, at 
whose urgings they confessed that the money had been intended for the 
use of the International! ! ! This was the real beginning of the whole 
business—but since Heddeghem had already informed the police 
in Paris of all this, it could come as a surprise only to the Toulouse 
police at most. These then are the fellows that Dentraygues 
denounced, and there was no one else. How the police found out 
about other things you will see from the VolksstaaU At all events, 
at the present time the organisation in France is in pieces and will 
take some time to recover since all communications have broken 
down. Larroque is in Spain, in San Sebastian. His address: 
Monsieur Latraque, Calle de la Aduana, No. 21—he is living 
there under that name. For goodness' sake do not send any new 
letters of authority to France. Larroque has been given 3 years in 
contumaciam! 1 
6. STAMPS.682 —I hardly ever see Le Moussu, I have got Marx to 
give him a good kick, but still no answer. It is impossible to do any 
business with these Frenchmen without wasting whole weeks at a 
time chasing after them, and I cannot do that. 
7. Venue for the Congress.672—I hope you have only asked the 
Swiss for their advice as we did with the Dutch last year. In 
Switzerland there is only one possible place and that is Geneva. 
There we have the mass of workers behind us, and also a hall 
belonging to the International, the Temple Unique, from which we 
can simply throw the gentlemen from the Alliance10  out when 
they present themselves. Apart from Geneva, only Zurich would 
be possible; but there we have hardly more than the few German 
workers and not even all of these (vide the Felleisen) and your 
a F. Engels,  'On the Articles  in the  Neuer Social-Demokrat (From  a Letter  to 
A. Hepner)'.  - b F. Engels,  'The  International  and the  Neuer'.  - c in his  absence

293. Engels to Sorge. 3 May 1873 493 
enquiry might even result in the proposal from various sides that 
the Congress should be held at the centrally situated town of 
Olten—the chief railway junction in Switzerland, in which case we 
should really be in the soup. The Alliancists are doing everything 
in their power to turn up at the Congress in force, whereas on our 
side everyone is going to sleep. No French delegates can come 
since the collapse. The Germans, although they have their own 
quarrel with the Lassalleans, were very disheartened by the Hague 
Congress, where they expected nothing but fraternity and 
harmony in contrast to their own squabbles, and have become 
apathetic. Moreover, the party authorities of the Social-Democratic 
Workers' Party consist at the moment of nothing but dyed-in-the-
wool Lassalleans (Yorck & Co.) who are insisting that both the 
Party and its paper should be forced into the straitjacket of a 
Lassalleanism of the most superficial sort. The struggle continues; 
the Lassalleans wish to take advantage of the time in which 
Liebknecht and Bebel are in gaol 274 so as to get their own way. 
Little Hepner is putting up vigorous resistance, but he has been as 
good as forced off the board of the Volksstaat and anyway has 
been deported from Leipzig. 691 The victory of these fellows would 
be synonymous with the loss of the Party for us—for the moment 
at least. I have written Liebknecht a very determined letter to this 
effect 49 and am still awaiting a reply.—From Denmark nothing 
has been seen or heard. My long-held suspicion that the 
Lassalleans of the Neuer Social-Demokrat have thrown everything 
into confusion there through their supporters in North Schleswig 
and have induced people to withdraw from the International, 3 is 
daily confirmed by the Neuer Social-Demokrat, which is much better 
informed about events in Copenhagen than the Volksstaat. —From 
England only a few delegates can come and it is very doubtful 
whether the Spaniards will send one, so it is to be expected that 
the Congress will be very poorly attended and that the Bakuninists 
will have more people there than us. The Genevans themselves are 
doing nothing, the Égalité seems to be defunct, so that even there 
no great support appears likely—merely the consciousness that 
there we shall be sitting in our own house and among people who 
know Bakunin and his gang and can throw them out if need be. 
So Geneva is the only place possible, and to secure a victory for us, 
the only necessary condition remaining—though it is an absolutely 
indispensable one—is that, in accordance with the resolution of 
26 January, 680 the General Council should now announce the 
following resignations: 
a See this volume, p. 466. 

=====第528页=====
494 293. Engels to Sorge. 3 May 1873 
1. The Belgian Federation, which has declared that it has 
nothing to do with the General Council and which has repudiated 
the Hague resolutions. 
2. That part of the Spanish Federation which was represented 
in Cordoba627 and which contravened the Rules by declaring the 
payment of dues to the General Council to be optional, and which 
has also repudiated the Hague resolutions. 
3. The English sections and individuals represented at the 
would-be London congress of 26 January, who have likewise 
repudiated the Hague resolutions.852 
4. The Jura Federation which, at the congress they are due to 
hold shortly,692 will undoubtedly give us adequate grounds to 
extend the resolution on suspension. 
Lastly, it could be announced that the so-called Italian Federa­
tion which was represented at the so-called congress of Bologna670 
(instead of Mirandola), is not a member of the International at all 
since it has never satisfied even a single one of the conditions laid 
down by the Rules.693 
Once this resolution has been published and the General 
Council has set up a committee in Geneva to make preparations 
for the Congress and to scrutinise the mandates in advance, a 
committee consisting e.g. of Becker, 3 Perret, Duval and Utin, if he 
is there, the mass surge forward of the Bakuninists will have been 
forestalled. As soon as the General Council has issued instructions 
to the committees that these people cannot be given recognition as 
delegates until they have been granted admission by the majority 
of the genuine and acknowledged delegates of the International, 
all will be well. Even if they were in the majority, they would be 
innocuous; they could go elsewhere and hold their own congress, 
but without having brought their majority to bear vis-à-vis 
ourselves. And that is all we can ask for. 
Cordial regards from Marx too.

Dear Moor, 
I wrote to Gumpert the day before yesterday45 and gave him my 
opinion on your case, together with a brief account of what had 
happened (of course, I kept quiet about everything to do with the 
situation at home, merely saying that you had had a lot of 
vexation in various matters), just so that I should have done my

from his eldest stepson saying that Gumpert wouldn't be back for 
8-10 days and that he had sent my letter on to him. 
Kept busy by Lafargue until 4.30a; it got too late for me to send 
off a registered letter, so I shall send it on Monday with money so 
that you can use the time for excursions if you feel like it. 
I also have the £50 here; should I give it to your wife? 
We shall be finished with Russia in a few days, except for a tiny

Dear FRED, 
I am quickly writing these few lines in reply in Schorlemmer's 
room. I am just on the point of going for a walk with him since 
Moorea is with his Dulcinea and only intends to reappear at ABOUT 
6 O'CLOCK. 
It was damnably cold here with an easterly wind until today, so 
that I have caught a cold in optima forma. 
The same day, or rather evening, as I arrived, the first person I 
encountered was, as usual, the inevitable Borchardt.

BRAVE Dakyns, I learn from Moore, will have nothing more to do

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] Monday, 26 May [1873] 
Dear Moor, 
Enclosed £10 in 2 bills: C76, 48 876 & 77, London, 6 February 
1873.—  I shall go round to your wife with the money this 
afternoon. 
I did a stupid thing on Saturday.3 Your wife was here and in 
something of a flurry I gave her your letterb —she stared at the 
closing passage for some time but said nothing. Nor could she in 
fact make anything very much from your belief that Mr Lissagaray 
will have pour le moment to make bonne mine à mauvais jeu. c If she 
asks me, I shall say that all I know is that you had expressed 
doubts as to whether one could simply rely on Lissagaray's sticking 
to his promise and that you had therefore already talked here 
about writing to Tussy in an attempt to influence her. 
So Mr Thiers has been truly out-parliamented and shown to the 
door by MacMahon, the greatest jackass in France. The reaction 
really is a slippery slope down which one cannot stop oneself 
sliding, once one has embarked on it. If MacMahon is anything at 
all, then he is a Bonapartist, and it is delightful to see that, just as 
in 1848 when the two old monarchist parties were forced to place 
Louis Bonaparte at the head, so now they have to rally behind his 
governor. In my opinion, this makes the restoration of the 
Empire the only possible monarchist combination for the moment. 
The quarrels of the Orleanists and Legitimists will disgust 
MacMahon; the Rouhers, etc., will ensnare him and, when he is ripe 
for it, the point where they can instruct him how to lead the troops, 
etc., to a Bonapartist coup. Then everything will depend on the 
troops, and MacMahon, whatever else he may be, will certainly do 
everything in his power—and en connaissance de cause d—to train 
them to this end. En attendant,' Thiers is now becoming more 
popular than ever and Gambetta is receding into the background, 
so that when things start up once more, the line of people who 
will have, to make complete asses of themselves all over again will 
stretch all the way from Thiers to Félix Pyat.

precisely the military worthies happen to be.

ENGELS TO MARX 697 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 30 May 1873 
Dear Moor, 
This morning in bed the following dialectical points about the 
natural sciences came into my head: 
The object of science: matter in motion, bodies. Bodies cannot 
be separated from motion, their forms and kinds can only be 
apprehended in motion; nothing can be said about bodies 
divorced from motion, divorced from all relation to other bodies. 
Only in motion does the body reveal what it is. Hence natural 
science obtains knowledge about bodies by examining them in 
their relationship to each other, in motion. Cognition of the 
various forms of motion is cognition of bodies. The investigation 
of these various forms of motion is therefore the chief object of 
the natural sciences.b 
1. The simplest form of motion is change of place (within time, 
to do old Hegel a favour)—mechanical motion. 
a) There is no such thing as the motion of a single body, but 
relatively speaking one can talk of a falling body in such terms. 
Motion towards a centre common to many bodies. However, as 
soon as a single body moves in a direction other than towards the 
centre, the laws of falling still apply, it is true, but they are 
modifiedc

C. S.' - c Marginal note by Carl Schorlemmer: 'Quite right.'

b) into the laws of trajectories and lead directly to the 
interaction of several bodies—planetary, etc., motion, astronomy, 
equilibrium—temporarily or apparently to motion  itself.  The real 
result of this kind of motion, however, is ultimately always the 
contact of the moving bodies; they fall into one another. 
c) Mechanics of contact—bodies in contact. Ordinary 
mechanics, levers, inclined planes, etc. But this does not exhaust the 
effects of contact. Contact is manifested directly in two forms: 
friction and impact. It is a characteristic of both that, at certain 
degrees of intensity and under certain conditions, they give rise to 
new effects, no longer of a merely mechanical nature: heat, light, 
electricity, magnetism. 
2. Physics proper, the science of these forms of motion, estab­
lishes the fact, after investigating each form of motion separately, 
that they merge into one another under certain conditions, and 
ultimately discovers that given a certain degree of intensity, which 
varies for different moving bodies, they all produce effects that 
transcend physics; changes in the internal structure of bodies— 
chemical effects. 
3. Chemistry. In the case of the preceding forms of motion it was 
more or less immaterial whether the bodies under investigation 
were animate or inanimate. In fact inanimate objects revealed the 
nature of the phenomena involved in their greatest purity. 
Chemistry, on the other hand, can only discover the chemical 
nature of the most important bodies by using substances deriving 
from the life process. Its principal task is increasingly that of 
producing these substances synthetically. It forms the transition to 
the science of organisms, but the dialectical point of transition can 
only be constructed when chemistry has effected the real transition 
or is on the point of doing so.a 
4. Organism—for the present I shall not indulge in any 
dialectical speculations on the subject.b 
Since you are at the very centre of the natural sciences there, 
you will be in the best position to judge whether there is anything 
in it or not.

MARX TO ENGELS 3' 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 31 May 1873 
25 Dover Street 
DEAR FRED, 
Have just received your letter which edified me greatly. 
However, I shall venture no judgment until I have had time to 
reflect on the matter and consult the 'authorities'.3 
I have been telling Moore about a problem with which I have 
been racking my brains for some time now. However, he thinks it 
is insoluble, at least pro tempore, because of the many factors 
involved, factors which for the most part have yet to be 
discovered. The problem is this: you know about those graphs in 
which the movements of prices, discount rates, etc., etc., over the 
year, etc., are shown in rising and falling zigzags. I have variously 
attempted to analyse crises by calculating these  UPS AND DOWNS  as 
irregular curves and I believed (and still believe it would be 
possible if the material were sufficiently studied) that I might be 
able to determine mathematically the principal laws governing 
crises.  As I said, Moore thinks it cannot be done at present and I 
have resolved to give it up FOR THE TIME BEING. 
The French catastrophe 96 was welcome in so far as it involved 
disgrace for Thiers and his lickspittles; but unwelcome since, if it 
had gone the other way, I might have hoped to see various 
individuals removed from London soon. Moreover, I regard any 
violent catastrophe now as UNTIMELY both from the viewpoint of the 
interests of France and from our own. 
Nevertheless, I am by no means convinced that the événement* 
3 Carl Schorlemmer and Samuel Moore - b event

will result in a restoration. The RURALS 478 had undoubtedly 
reckoned with some sort of revolt in Paris, Lyons and Marseilles, 
and especially in Paris. In that event they would have come down 
hard, some of the radical Left would have been arrested, etc., in 
short it would have led to a situation which d'une manière ou d'une 
autre 3 would have had to end in a restoration, and quickly at that. 
Bonaparte  himself,  in his attempt to carry out his coup d'état, i.e. 
to bring it to a conclusion, found himself paralysed the very first 
day by the merely passive resistance of the Parisians, and he knew 
full well that if that were to last another 6-8 days the coup would 
be lost and lost irretrievably. Hence the signal to go ahead with 
gruesome murders in the boulevards, etc., sans provocation aucune^ 
to improvise a terreur. 0 Mr Morny in particular, the real MANAGER, 
has since spoken very candidly about this planned operation, 
whose author he had been. 
For that, however, the Rurals lacked the PLUCK; and they could 
only have had it if they had had one pretender instead of three. 
Their hope was rather the opposite one: that events would force 
them to stop acting like Buridan's ass.698 
Now that they find themselves, in contrast, in a purely 
parliamentary situation, the row is flaring up again in their own 
ranks.  Each hopes to gain the support of as much of the nearest 
faction, SAY, FOR INSTANCE, THE LEFT CENTRE, as would be necessary to 
enable him to dispense with his rivals. However, as far as 
MacMahon is concerned, in my judgment, the worthy fellow will 
never take any action on his own initiative. There is also another 
factor that must hasten the dissolution of this amalgam. The only 
thing that formally binds them together is God, i.e. Catholicism. 
The more impetuous and 'honest' people on the Right will 
absolutely insist that the Ministry should show its colours to the 
Poped and Spain,699 and it seems to me that, quite apart from any 
inner reluctance to do so, the need to consider Mr Bismarck's 
feelings must prevent any step in that direction. However, the 
Jesuit fathers who have actually directed the entire strategy of the 
Rurals up to now, including, i.a., that old bag, MacMahon's wife,e 
will not let themselves be fobbed off so simply. In such a situation 
the National Assembly might easily witness just such a swift 
changement de décoration 1 as took place recently. After all, it was 
a in one way or another - b without any provocation - c  This refers to the actions of 
the instigators of the Bonapartist coup d'état in France on 2 December 1851. -

only the SHIFTING of 9 votes that made the homme nécessaire 3 
impossible, a thing which, incidentally, disproves Hegel's view that 
necessity entails possibility.15 
The day before yesterday I went to see Dronke in Southport. 
He has become exceedingly fat, which does not suit him. While 
there I saw par accident Strauss' book Der neue und der alte Glaube, 
loaned to him by a German philistine. I leafed through it, and it 
really is proof of the great weakness of the Volksstaat that no one 
there has put this damned priest and Bismarck-worshipper (who 
gives himself such airs vis-à-vis socialism) in his proper place. 
This afternoon I am going to Buxton with Moore, so that I shall 
be out of the way until Monday.0 As soon as I have seen Gumpert, 
I shall return. Just lazing-around and idling has done me a world 
of good. 
Enclosed a letter from Tussy. In the letter the child received 
from me17  I said to her that her last letter had greatly reassured 
me, etc.; her reproach that I was unjust towards Lissagaray was 
unfounded. I asked nothing of him but that he should provide 
proof instead of words that he was better than his reputation and 
that there was some good reason to rely on him. You can see from 
the reply how the homme fort d proceeds. The damned nuisance is 
that I must be very circumspect and indulgent because of the 
child. I shall not answer until I have consulted you on my return. 
Keep the letter by you. 
Schorlemmer has just arrived. He cannot accompany Moore and 
me because Roscoe is unwell and this is the period for preparing 
for exams. 
Schorlemmer read you letter" and says that he is essentially in 
agreement with you but reserves his judgment on points of detail.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 14 June 1873 
Dear Sorge, 
Work on the Alliance' has interrupted my correspondence. In 
addition the newspapers have only just started to arrive regularly 
again now that we have ordered them, and so it is only now that I 
can report properly again. 
First, to deal with the points raised in your letters. 
The ones from the General Councilb are answered in the 
enclosure. 
14 May.—The business about the shortage of funds is as old as 
the International  itself.  The Americans were the only ones to pay, 
and if it hadn't been for you, we would have been unlikely to 
receive even that.—Postponing the Congress672 is absolutely out of 
the question; it would mean abandoning the field to the other side 
and anyway is not at all necessary, as you will see. 
23 May.—The people in Geneva I am supposed to be giving a 
kick do not even answer us. Even old Becker0  does not reply to 
Marx. Outine is we know not where. We ourselves do not receive 
the Bulletin jurassien, and only see extracts quoted in the Liberté 
and the Internationale. 
27 May.—The statement on France700—very good!—has gone 
off in English to the BRITISH FEDERAL COUNCIL and will go off today 
in French to the Plebe, the Spanish Federal Council and Portugal. 
BY THE  BYE the Portuguese are complaining that they are not 
receiving anything at all from you and yet they are very, very 
important for us!—Serraillier has absolutely nothing to write 
about, since he does not have a single address in France any more; 
everyone has been caught. However, he will send in a little report 
on the trials677  for your own report to the Congress—there were 
trials everywhere where there were sections, in Béziers, Lisieux, etc., 
etc.—Correspondence for the Arbeiter-Zeitung} Who is to do it? 
Marx and I are so overworked that Marx has been limited by his 
doctor to 4 hours work a day because of blood-congestion in the

Working Men's Association. - b F. Engels, 'To the General Council of the Inter­

head, so that I have to deal with everything together with Lafargue. 
Frankel works in his  SHOP  until 9 p.m. The others cannot 
write.—The Hamburgers452  are numbskulls. I shall write and tell 
Liebknecht. —For Holland the German version of the statement 
will be adequate.—The Arbeiter-Zeitung should make more use of 
the Volksstaat. 
And now for some news, and this time it is no message of 
ill-tidings. 
1. The British Congress, held in Manchester on 1 and 2 June, 
was a success.701 26 delegates.—Report from the Tory paper going 
off by BOOK-POST herewith; ditto 1 issue of the Brussels Inter­
nationale. The Federal Council to remain in London, although the 
locals wanted it transferred to Nottingham. The Eastern Post, 
hitherto the organ of Jung and Hales, has written a satirical article 
on the Congress which nevertheless acknowledges it as the real 
representative of the English International, and since then I 
observe that they have stopped publishing reports on BOGUS 
meetings in Hales' house; they seem to have shut up shop. Up to 
now they had always alternated these reports with reports from all 
of their 2 sections: Stratford and Limehouse, and Limehouse and 
Stratford; but this no longer seems to work.—Mottershead turned 
up in Hyde Park on Whit Mondaya  for the TRADES UNION MEETING, 
completely drunk as usual.— I have not received The International 
Herald for the past 2 weeks, so that too seems to have folded up. 
It's no misfortune since there are the other publications of the 
English press. The new French section here (Dupont and 
Serraillier) have some chance of starting up a French paper here, 
though French assurances cannot be relied on very much. 
2. The Jurassians have carried out their decisive retreat.692  You 
will see from the Internationale that they have resolved to propose 
to their colleagues in the Alliance: not to send representatives to 
any congress 'que le prétendu Conseil general pourrait être tenté de 
convoquer'* but to hold a separate congress at a place in Switzerland 
to be determined by their federations. 
Translated that means: we cannot put in an appearance in 
Geneva, otherwise we shall be thrown out on our ears. So they will 
meet in some corner of the Jura; after the Olten Congress (see 
below) they cannot show their faces anywhere else in Switzer­
land.—Other reasons are: 1. Bakunin's old reluctance to appear in 
debates personally, 2. Guillaume's and his own expulsion, which 
would raise the crucial issue from the very outset in a purely 
a 9 June - b which the so-called General Council might be tempted to convene 

=====第543页=====
302.  Engels to Sorge. 14 June 1873 509 
personal form, added to which there is also the fact of Bakunin's 
escroquerie, 3574 which would immediately finish him off, and 3. the 
certainty that in reality they are in as bad a way as we are and that 
internal squabbles have exhausted and irritated their people too. 
At their great Jura congress only nine sections were represented! 
In Italy, for all their bluster, they cannot put a single newspaper 
on its feet, and in Spain, in the movement as it stands, their stock 
is=0.  More, they have had to renege on their own policy of 
abstention at once, and sent 8 members (10 according to them) 
into the Cortes. 
3. In Rome a committee 'of the International' has been dis­
banded. It was called Società del Silenzio, clandestine society, oath 
of absolute obedience, the sacramental formula at the end of 
letters—the one proclaimed by Bakunin last year: Salute e 
liquidazione sociale, anarchia e collectivismo h—in short, the secret 
Alliance ,0 with its whole bag of tricks. It comes just at the right 
time. 
4. Serraillier has had an exchange in the Liberté with the 
Blanquists about the French trials 702 in which the latter took a very 
impudent line, but were duly boxed around the ears for it. What 
really finished them off was that after the letters of authority of 
those with mandates had been annulled at The Hague and the 
General Council was alone empowered to issue new ones,0 Cournet 
and Ranvier issued a new letter of authority to Heddeghem in 
their names—and while still at The Hague! 
5. Swiss workers' congress at Olten70 —70 delegates, 5 Juras-
sians,  proposed decentralisation, defeated with all votes against 
their 5—they withdrew at once. But you will have known this long 
since from the Tagwachtd 
I hope that your arm and voice are now recovered and that 
your prospects for the Congress have also improved. Even if the 
Congress is not very brilliant, it is nevertheless necessary and with 
some effort will turn out well. Don't forget that according to the 
Rules you must convoke it and prepare a programme 2 months in 
advance, i.e. by 1 July. 
Alliance as good as finished—in French; a mammoth task in 
this tricky language—shall hit out and surprise even you.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 704 
IN HUBERTUSBURG 
London, 20 June 1873 
Dear Bebel, 
I am answering your letter first because Liebknecht's is still with 
Marx, who cannot locate it just now. 
It was not Hepner but Yorck's letter to him, signed by the 
Committee, which made us here fear that your imprisonment274 
would be used by the Party authorities, which unfortunately are 
entirely Lassallean, to transform the Volksstaat into an 'honest' 
Neuer Social-Demokrat. Yorck plainly confessed to such an inten­
tion, and as the Committee claimed to have the right to appoint 
and remove the editors, the danger was certainly big enough. 
Hepner's impending deportation ' was another argument in 
favour of these plans. Under these circumstances it was absolutely 
necessary for us to know where we stood; hence this correspon­
dence. 70^ 
You must not forget that Hepner, to say nothing of Seiffert and 
Bios,  etc., do not enjoy anything like the same position vis-à-vis 
Yorck as you and Liebknecht do as founders of the Party, and that 
if you simply ignore such impertinences, this is something that can 
hardly be expected of them. The Party authorities, after all, have a 
certain formal measure of control over the Party paper, which 
they refrained from exercising when you were there, but which 
they have undeniably tried to impose this time, with damaging 

=====第545页=====
303. Engels to Bebel. 20 June 1873 511 
effects on the Party. We thought it our duty, therefore, to do what 
we could to counteract this. 
Hepner may have been involved in tactical infringements on 
points of detail, chiefly after receiving the Committee's letter, but 
we definitely think he is in the right on the substantial issue. Nor 
can I accuse him of weakness, for if the Committee clearly gives 
him to understand that he should resign from the editorial board, 
adding that otherwise he will have to work under Bios, I do not 
see what other resistance he could offer. He could certainly not 
barricade himself in the editor's office against the Committee. 
After such a categorical letter from a superior authority I can even 
find it in me to excuse Hepner's comments in the Volksstaat which 
you cited and which had when I first read them, earlier on, made 
an unpleasant impression on me. 
This much is certain: since Hepner's arrest and absence from 
Leipzig, the Volksstaat has deteriorated greatly, and instead of 
quarrelling with him the Committee would have done better to 
give him every possible support. The Committee went so far as to 
demand changes in the editorial policy of the Volksstaat, they 
insisted that the scholarly articles should be omitted and replaced 
by leading articles in the style of the Neuer" and threatened direct 
compulsion. I do not know Bios at all, but if the same Committee 
simultaneously nominates him, it must be assumed that they have 
chosen someone after their own heart. 
With regard to the attitude of the Party towards Lassalleanism, 
you, of course, can judge better than us what tactics should be 
adopted, especially in individual cases. But there is also this to be 
considered. When, as in your case, one is to a certain extent in the 
position of a competitor to the General Association of German 
Workers,706 one can easily become too considerate of one's rival 
and get into the habit of always thinking of him first. But both the 
General Association of German Workers and the Social-
Democratic Workers' Party together still form only a very small 
minority of the German working class. Our view, which we have 
found confirmed by long practice, is that the correct tactics in 
propaganda are not to entice away a few individuals and 
memberships here and there from one's opponent, but to work on 
the great mass, which is as yet uninvolved. The force of a single 
individual whom one has oneself reared from the raw is worth 
more than ten Lassallean defectors, who always bring the germ of 
their false tendencies into the Party with them. And if one could 
a Neuer Social-Demokrat 
18'

only get the masses without the local leaders it would still be all 
right. But one always has to take along a whole crowd of these 
leaders into the bargain, who are bound by their earlier public 
utterances, if not by their views hitherto, and now must prove 
above all things that they have not deserted their principles but 
that, on the contrary, the Social-Democratic Workers' Party 
preaches true Lassalleanism. This was the unfortunate thing at 
Eisenach,707 which could not be avoided at that time, perhaps, but 
there is no doubt at all that these elements have done harm to the 
Party and I am not sure that the Party would not be at least as 
strong today without that accession. In any case, however, I should 
regard it as a misfortune if these elements were to receive 
reinforcements. 
One must not allow oneself to be misled by the cry for 'unity'. 
Those who have this word most often on their lips are the ones 
who sow the most discord, just as at present the Jura Bakuninists 
in Switzerland, who have provoked all the splits, shout for nothing 
so much as for unity. These unity fanatics are either people of 
limited intelligence who want to stir everything into one nondes­
cript mush, which, the moment it is left to settle, throws up the 
differences again but in much sharper contrast, because they will 
then be all in one pot (in Germany we have a fine example of this 
in the people who preach reconciliation of the workers and the 
petty bourgeoisie)—or else they are people who unconsciously 
(like Mülberger, for instance) or consciously want to adulterate the 
movement. For this reason the biggest sectarians and the biggest 
brawlers and rogues shout loudest for unity at certain times. 
Nobody in our lifetime has given us more trouble and been more 
treacherous than the shouters for unity. 
Naturally every party leadership wants to see successes, and this 
is perfectly good. But there are circumstances in which one must 
have the courage to sacrifice momentary success for more 
important things. Especially for a party like ours, whose ultimate 
success is so absolutely certain and which has developed so 
enormously in our own lifetimes and before our own eyes, 
momentary success is by no means always and absolutely 
necessary. Take the International for instance. After the Com­
mune it had a colossal success. The bourgeois, struck all of a heap, 
ascribed omnipotence to it. The great mass of the members 
believed things would stay like that for all eternity. We knew very 
well that the bubble must burst. All the riff-raff attached 
themselves to it. The sectarians within it became arrogant and 
misused the International in the hope that the most stupid and

meanest actions would be permitted them. We did not allow that. 
Knowing well that the bubble must burst some time, our concern 
was not to delay the catastrophe but to take care that the 
International emerged from it pure and unadulterated. The 
bubble burst at The Hague580  and you know that the majority of 
the Congress members went home sick with disappointment. And 
yet nearly all these disappointed people, who imagined they would 
find the ideal of universal brotherhood and reconciliation in the 
International, had far more bitter quarrels at home than those 
which broke out at The Hague. Now the sectarian quarrel-
mongers are preaching reconciliation and decrying us as being 
quarrelsome and dictators. And if we had come out in a 
conciliatory way at The Hague, if we had hushed up the breaking 
out of the split—what would have been the result? The sectarians, 
especially the Bakuninists, would have got another year in which 
to perpetrate in the name of the International even far greater 
stupidities and infamies; the workers of the most developed 
countries would have turned away in disgust; the bubble would 
not have burst but, pierced by pinpricks, would have slowly 
collapsed, and the next Congress, which would have been bound 
to bring the crisis anyhow, would have turned into a row among 
the lowest kind of people, because principles would already have 
been sacrificed at The Hague. Then the International would 
indeed have gone to pieces—gone to pieces through 'unity'! 
Instead of this we have now got rid of the rotten elements with 
honour to ourselves—the members of the Commune who were 
present at the last and decisive session say that no session of the 
Commune left such an excruciating impression upon them as this 
session of the tribunal which passed judgment on the traitors to 
the European proletariat. For ten months we let them expend all 
their energies on lies, slander and intrigue—and where are they? 
They, the alleged representatives of the great majority of the 
International, now themselves announce that they do not dare to 
come to the next Congress. (More details in an article which is 
being sent off to the Volksstaat with this letter. 3) And if we had to 
do it again we would not, taking it all together, act any 
differently—tactical mistakes are always made, of course. 
In any case, I think the capable elements among the Lassalleans 
will fall to you of themselves in the course of time and it would, 
therefore, be unwise to break off the fruit before it is ripe, as the 
unity crowd wants to.

Incidentally, old man Hegel said long ago: A party proves itself 
victorious by splitting and being able to stand the split." The 
movement of the proletariat necessarily passes through different 
stages of development; at every stage part of the people get stuck 
and do not participate in the further advance; and this in itself is 
sufficient to explain why the 'solidarity of the proletariat', in fact, 
everywhere takes the form of different party groupings, which 
carry on life-and-death feuds with one another, as the Christian 
sects in the Roman Empire did amidst the worst persecutions. 
You must also not forget that, if the Neuer, for example, has 
more subscribers than the Volksstaat, this is due to the fact that 
each sect is necessarily fanatic and through this fanaticism obtains, 
particularly in regions where it is new (as, for instance, the 
General Association of German Workers in Schleswig-Holstein), 
much greater momentary successes than the Party, which simply 
represents the real movement, without any sectarian oddities. On 
the other hand, fanaticism does not last long. 
I have to close my letter so as to catch the post. Let me only add 
hurriedly: Marx cannot tackle Lassalle 708 until the French trans­
lation b is finished (approx. end of July),436 after which he will 
absolutely need a rest as he is very overworked. 
That you have been serving your jail sentence stoically and are 
studying is very admirable. We shall all be glad to see you here 
next year. 
Cordial greetings to Liebknecht. 
Sincerely yours,

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 
IN HANOVER 
London, 1 July 1873 
Dear Kugelmann, 
The entire story about Marx's illness stems from that idiot 
Barry, who got it into the newspapers710 and who will be given a 
good telling-off for it when he shows his face again. 
The actual situation is as follows: From time to time but to an 
increasing extent over a period of years now, Marx has suffered 
from insomnia, which he has always tried to explain away with all 
sorts of unconvincing reasons, e.g. a persistent cough in the 
throat, but which remained even when the cough had been cured. 
The real slog with the French translation of Capital436 (he more or 
less has to rewrite the whole thing from the beginning), the 
urgings of the publisher2 and unpleasantness connected both with 
this and other things exacerbated the situation. However, he could 
not be brought to stop overworking himself until finally he began 
a Maurice Lachâtre 

=====第550页=====
516 305. Engels to Kugelmann. 1 July 1873 
to experience a conspicuous pressure at the top of the head and 
the insomnia increased to an unbearable point where even very 
powerful doses of chloral had no effect. I knew about these 
symptoms from Lupusa who had also worked himself sick, was 
then neglected by his doctor and was finally treated for what was 
falsely diagnosed as meningitis. So I told Marx straightaway that 
he had the same thing as Lupus and that he must stop working. 
He first tried to shrug it off with bad jokes, but soon discovered 
that the more he forced himself the less work he could do. So I 
finally prevailed on him to go to Manchester and consult 
Gumpert.694  The latter just happened to be in Celle on a visit to 
his cousin Captain Wachs, so that Marx had about 12 days in 
Manchester to recover before Gumpert returned. I had written to 
Gumpert, 45 giving my opinion, and had also told him that Marx 
usually recovered very quickly. Gumpert thought my diagnosis was 
completely correct and put Marx under a strict regime: not more 
than 2 hours work in the morning and 2 in the evening, insisted 
on breakfast and exercise after breakfast, light wines with 
soda-water, plenty of movement, open bowels, a prescription I 
have not seen, a very powerful dose of chloral if the insomnia 
persisted, etc. Marx returned from Manchester much improved 
and even if he cannot quite keep it up, which is more than can be 
expected, he is nevertheless much better than previously, even on 
bad days. My intention is to take him right away from his work 
routine soon for a while, something which Gumpert incidentally 
also recommends as a definitive antidote, and if he can only get 
2-3 weeks rest and fresh air, he will be in a better state to take a 
few knocks. At all events he now sleeps 4-5 hours a night without 
chloral and 1-1 V2 hours after luncheon, and that is more than he 
has done for almost a year—in The Hague, for example, he hardly 
slept at all. Moreover, he knows that this time it is serious and 
sticks to the stipulations with an almost pedantic strictness, and, 
since any deterioration is immediately apparent, I can always 
preach rest and convalescence in good time.711 
Otherwise, things are more or less all right—Jennyb is looking 
forward to giving birth (but do not let her see that I have told 
you)—Laf argue and I have finished the pamphlet on Bakunin 
and the Alliance commissioned by the Congress, and as soon as it 
has been approved by the Commission,1" it will go into print; it is 
a Wilhelm Wolff - b Jenny Longuet - c The Commission appointed to prepare for 
publication the minutes and resolutions of the Hague Congress. Apart from Marx and 
Engels, it included Eugène Dupont, Léo Frankel, Auguste Serraillier and Benjamin 
Le Moussu.

sure to cause a terrible row.623  Lafargue and Dupont have started 
up a workshop to make brass instruments so as to exploit a patent 
taken out by Dupont; Serraillier will act as their salesman. 
Johannard has gone to Liverpool, Vichard pretends to be engaged 
in business transactions, Mottershead goes on drinking, Hales and 
Jung have failed spectacularly in their efforts to play at secession 
here,  Eccarius has disappeared without trace now that Parliament 
is not to be dissolved. I have sent other news items to the

Dear Citizen, 
After a lengthy interval, I have just sent off some of the 
manuscript (Part VI) and some proofsb to Mr Lahure. 
As you will know, the most dangerous thing about an illness is a 
relapse, but I am now in a condition to set to work seriously once 
more on Mr Roy's manuscript436—of which a great deal has now 
accumulated. 
However, the disruption caused by my illness cannot be to 
blame for the delay in the publication of fascicle IV and for the 
non-publication of fascicle V. 
At a time when I was very unwell I passed sheet 27 for press,

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 26 July 1873 
Dear Sorge, 
I telegraphed yesterday, cost £1,16: 
ENGELS TO SORGE, BOX 101, HOBOKEN, NEW YORK. 
Serraillier YES™2 
Therefore, send Serraillier instructions and the material at once 
so that he has enough time to prepare himself and doesn't have to 
appear without having read the papers. Ditto the money. 
Neither Marx nor I could have taken on the task without setting 
off the old hue and cry again: they are up to their old tricks, it is 
Marx who is behind it all, as usual, and he is just using the 
New-Yorkers as a front! It was only with difficulty that I could 
persuade Serraillier to take it on; he has found a position at last 
that can feed him decently and first had to cover himself there; 
hence the 3 days' delay. 
Have sent an invitation to the Congress to Bignami, who is at 
liberty once more.641 Have also informed Serraillier, but as I have 
already mentioned,3 he no longer has any correspondents in 
France. 
Am sending off to you by today's post 2 parcels d 16 copies of 
Congress resolutions.13 You could have had them long since had 
a See this volume, p. 507. - b  K. Marx and F. Engels, 'Resolutions of the 
General Congress Held at The Hague from the 2nd to the 7th September, 1872'.

you asked. But since you had no French sections, I thought that 
those I had sent for the use of the General Council would 
suffice.—8 or 10 have been sent off to Buenos Aires.713 
Have still not received any money. 
The issue of The International Herald with the English transla­
tion of the Congress resolutions is no longer to be obtained. 
Moreover, Riley has seceded and gone over to the republican 
camp,  and the reports of the FEDERAL COUNCIL are appearing once 
again in The Eastern Post, to the great annoyance of Jung and 
Hales,  whose organ this was up to the time of the Manchester 
Congress701; the Congress, however, finished them off. For this 
reason I have not ordered The International Herald for Meyer.3 
The statement about the French mandates has gone off to Italy, 
Portugal and Spain.700 
Marx and I would welcome mandates from there. We shall 
presumably have to go, for various reasons, although we would, of 
course, prefer to stay here. 
Marx will send on the instalments of Capital,145 if he has not 
done so already. Four instalments of the French translation are 
out already,436 the publisherb is afraid, and not without reason, 
that under the present clerical regime it may be confiscated, hence 
the slow appearance. 
Admission for TRADES UNIONS varied. Some paid Id per member, 
others a lump sum; yet others only enrolled the CENTRAL COUNCIL 
directly and they too paid a lump sum. In conformity with the 
relevant article in the Rules, affiliation was approved by simple 
resolution and a certificate was issued to them.— For lsh. they 
could receive a printed illustrated version of it to hang on the wall. 
The Demokratische Taschenbuch and the Geheimnisse von Europa 
might be obtainable if further details about the time and place of 
publication were available; the book-lexica do not stretch to such 
things and it is hardly worthwhile searching through 20 half-year 
issues of Hinrich's Bibliography c in order to discover finally that 
they are not there (which is all too likely to be the case with books 
of this sort). 
I still have the Geneva money in my pocket, thanks to the 
impossible instructions you have lumbered me with. How am I to 
discover an address to send money to for the widows and orphans 
of the Commune? This part of the money really must be retained 
here for your further instructions, since we simply cannot carry 
a Hermann Meyer - b  Maurice Lachâtre - c Halbjahrskatalog der im deutschen Buch­
handel erschienenen Bücher, Zeitschriften und Landkarten.

out your orders. I would suggest transferring it to Serraillier with 
a request to devote it to the purpose specified, if at all  possible,  but 
otherwise using it for any refugees of the Commune in general. 
Or else transferring it to the International, which can certainly put 
it to good use.—The refugees here who have still not been fixed 
up are a pretty worthless lot. I shall send £10 to Geneva and hold 
the rest here, pending further instructions from you.714 
Oberwinder.3 We are entirely of your opinion as far as we can 
judge from the published documents.715  Oberwinder has always 
been a TRIMMER who may have made too much of the backwardness 
of Austrian conditions in order to have an excuse to act as 
mediator. Andreas Scheu, on the other hand, is a muddle-headed 
fellow at best, who wants to stand out as a man who 'goes as far as 
possible' and whose ambition quite certainly outstrips his abilities. 
We have long suspected him of being in contact with the 
Bakuninists, and now, in his programme (  Volksstaat  No. 59), he 
has used the phrase taken directly from Bakunin that all other 
parties constitute a single reactionary mass vis-à-vis the proletariat. 716 
We shall reserve our judgment until we learn more. Very suspect 
too is the fact that Heinrich Scheu, who was present at The 
Hague, has been here for 4 weeks and only looked up Marx after 
Mrs Marx had met him in the street. Up to now we have taken 
care not to discuss the matter with him, otherwise he behaves quite 
decently and heaps abuse on Bakunin and the Blanquists, but it is 
peculiar all the same. 
Würtz was described to me by Pihl as a vain, importunate fellow 
who imagines he is indispensable and whose indiscretion in 
pushing himself forward has done them considerable harm. THE 
LONG  AND  THE SHORT OF IT  is that, thanks to the Lassalleans in Flensburg 
and others in North Schleswig, the Danes lean more towards the 
General Association of German Workers 706 and have got them­
selves into a mess as a result. Hence their silence. The devil take 
the socialists of all these peasant countries, they, are always fooled 
by fine phrases. 
Look at our Bakuninists in Spain, for example. On Bakunin's 
orders they abolished the state in Alcoy (the so-called atrocities 
were, of course, reactionary inventions), and set up a Comité de 
salut public h (which includes Severino Albarracin, a member of the 
Bakuninist Federal Council of Valencia and of the Correspon­
dence Commission that has now been established in Cordoba 627). 
So what happens? At the suggestion of some deputies anxious to

mediate, peace is concluded; on the one hand, an amnesty, on the 
other, all resistance is abandoned and the troops move in amidst 
the jubilation of the bourgeois!717 In Barcelona they are neither 
strong nor courageous enough to attempt anything of the sort, but 
wherever they are, they strengthen 'anarchy', general confusion, 
and—they smooth the way for the Carlists.718 
The report on the Alliance3  is in print—I read the first proofs 
yesterday. It is supposed to be ready in a week but I very much 
doubt that it will. It will be some 160 pages long, I shall advance 
circa £40 for the printing costs. Edition of 1,000—price: 2 
francs=l/9d sterling. I shall send you the first copies to come off 
the press. But since the thing simply has to be sold so as to recover 
our costs, please let me know right away how many copies can be 
ordered for you over there; we shall then have a few more sent. 
Could you also look around for a reliable bookseller who would 
distribute it over there. Because of the additional expenses you 
will probably have to fix the price at about 60-75 cents in your 
CURRENCY— c'est votre affaire b—at any rate, we here have to receive 
l/9d per copy, with the exception of those sold through the 
bookseller since his discount will have to be subtracted, otherwise 
we shall not recover our costs. The book will hit the autonomists 
like a bombshell, and if anyone at all can be broken, it will finish 
off Bakunin. Lafargue and I wrote it together; only the conclusion 
is by Marx and  myself.  We shall send it to the entire press. You 
yourself will be surprised at the infamies revealed in it; even the 
people from the Commission0 were quite astonished. 
The FEDERAL COUNCIL here proceeds on its somnolent way. Apart 
from the printed reports I see and hear little of them. At all 
events, Jung, Hales, Mottershead and Co. are finished as far as 
their pseudo-International is concerned. 
Get some Copenhagen addresses for me through Würtz right 
away, so that I can send there a few copies of the Alliance report. 
Have not heard another word from Pihl, so that I do not know if 
his address is still valid. 
Apart from that things are jogging along here. My wifed  is in 
Ramsgate and Mrs Marx was due to go there today too. Jenny

since he knows as much about business as my dog. All this 
between ourselves. You have no idea how sensitive these people 
are about private communications, moreover their sensitivity is in 
direct proportion to their own tendency to gossip. 
Finally, it would still be best if one of you were to come. How

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN RAMSGATE  723 
[London,] 29 August 1873 
Dear FRED, 
Serraillier was here this evening. He was full of complaints and 
very much in two minds about his going to Geneva.724 Quite apart 
from personal reasons, he says he had only agreed in the first 
place because he thought we were going. In addition, however, he 
has now read the mandate, which had been promised him two 
weeks before the Congress, so he says. He finds that it contains 
things, such as increasing the POWERS of the COUNCIL, that he could 
not defend either personally or in the name of the FEDERAL 
COUNCIL.' 
But none of that is the essential point. The FEDERAL COUNCIL has 
received a letter from Perret which makes it clear 
1. that the Fédération Romande wishes to annul the plenary 
powers granted to the GENERAL COUNCIL by the Hague Congress ; 
a instalment - b edition in serial parts - c  K. Marx and F. Engels, The Alliance of 
Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association. - d Bakunin -
e Marx's pseudonym - ' the British Federal Council 

=====第558页=====
524 309.  Marx  to Engels.  29 August  1873 
2. that not a single member of the Romance gang in Geneva 
will accept a mandate from an English section, apart from Duval, 
and even he will only do so on the condition stated under 1; 
3. that, as Perret writes, none of the oafs there is prepared to 
spend as much as a week at the Congress, which would be 
essential if the mandate is to go through. 
Under these circumstances I am definitely of the opinion that it 
would be better for Serraillier not to go. The scandal rebounds 
back on us, not him, if he goes—under these circumstances, which 
could not have been foreseen. In my view he should send a letter 
enclosing the American papers725 and go on to say that ill health 
prevents him from taking up the mandates he has received from 
New York, London, etc. Finally, he should say that the letters he 
has received in London from the main continental countries have 
convinced him that in the light of circumstances currently 
prevailing in France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, etc., 
no bona fide congress is possible. 
Telegraph YES right away, if you agree; No, if opposed. I did 
not wish to commit myself to anything definite without consulting 
you first. 
In view of the circumstances in Switzerland, which have been 
carefully concealed from us up to the last moment, I think it would 
be absolutely crazy to send Serraillier. Our complete abstention, 
which even at this stage both can and will make an impression on 
the governments and the bourgeoisie—despite the hullabaloo the 
papers will create to start with— va au diable, 3 if Serraillier turns 
up under these circumstances. 
Salut 
Your

Sorge also writes (perhaps you know already) that the Dutch 
have informed them that they will also attend the Jura Con­
gress, 671 and he insists that the Dutch should not be admitted to 
our (!) Congress, a point which Serraillier, as their mandated 
representative, is expressly asked to support.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Ramsgate, 30 August 1873 
Dear Moor, 
If Serraillier won't go, we cannot force him  to. 724 However, / 
cannot absolve him of his promise, since I have telegraphed his 
acceptance," and in any event he must himself come to terms with 
the General Council. 
Against the reasons you give, it must be urged that it is 
important for us to have a reporter; without Serraillier we shall 
not receive any account of what takes place, especially in the 
closed sessions. 
What is absolutely essential, however, and our duty to the General 
Council, is that the two reports enclosed725 which are utterly 
useless in Geneva in English, should be translated into French in 
time and sent off to Geneva. In the circumstances you must make 
sure that this is done. If 3-4 people each do a part at the same 
time,  it can be ready in 1-2 days, and even if it doesn't come out 
just as one would have wished, the rush excuses everything. 
In the circumstances, the sorrier our Congress672  turns out to be 
the better, of course, and to that extent it is better if Seiraillier 
doesn't go. But I am in the awkward position of having given 
assurances that he would attend, assurances that I cannot reverse 
unilaterally. 
Why on earth doesn't even one of those Geneva jackasses write 
in good time! What a dirty trick, and brought about by the very 
people who made all the fuss to start with! The others will 
undoubtedly have the laugh on them and insist that they should 
indeed eat humble pie and recognise their Congress671 and their 
new Rules. And Duval, who was in such a fury in The Hague,580 
has also joined in the hue and cry—it really is the last straw. 
Well, it will all be very jolly. Regards to all.

Your telegram45 received; Serraillier arrived later on with 
Perret's letter to Days in his pocket.727 I couldn't keep it for you 
because Days, who is secretary of the local FEDERAL COUNCIL, needs 
to report on it on Tuesday.3  However, Serraillier has promised to 
make a copie of it for you. The letter is classical; the 'ILLIMITED' 
POWERS or rather 'pouvoirs illimités' which the La Haye Congress 580 
granted to the GENERAL COUNCIL, must be withdrawn from it. On 
this point the Genevois —and ditto Mr Perret —are agreed; for 
then there is some hope that des sections  jurassiennes will go over to 
them. For years now this same Perret has been writing that these 
SECTIONS would go over to them if only the GENERAL COUNCIL would 
proceed more energetically against the Jurassians! And of course 
everything is always looked at from the most bigoted and most 
parochial Swiss point of view. Furthermore, Frankel tells me that 
the same riff-raff are discontented with the resolutions passed at 
Olden, or whatever the place is called where the local Swiss 
congress met! 70s In the circumstances there can be absolutely no 
question of going to Geneva672 on account of people like that, 
people who even refuse to accept mandates from English sections.b 
I think you would do well to send a counter-order to Hepner 
without delay; he will still receive the avisc in time. 
Yesterday,  A FEW HOURS  before I wrote to you, je l'ai échappé belle? 
and can still feel the effects in all my bones. I drank a spoonful of 
raspberry vinegar and some of it stuck in my wind-pipe. I had a 
terrible choking-fit, my face went quite black, etc. Another second 
or so and I would have departed this life. The first thing that 
occurred to me post festum e was whether it might not be possible to 
bring about such ACCIDENTS artificially. It would be the most decent 
and least suspicious method, and moreover a highly expeditious 
one, of doing away with  oneself.  It would be a great service to the 
English if one could recommend the experiment publicly.

Aproposl Lafargue and Le Moussu have definitely split up. 719 It 
took place—the separation, that is—when Le Moussu declared his 
willingness to do so since reluctance was in evidence on the other 
side.  Le Moussu is now counting on you. I think the separation is 
a good thing and had become a necessity for both sides, since a lot

The Genevans are complete philistines. So everything is to be 
overturned on the possibility that des sections jurassiennes will 
return to the fold! I am convinced that they are already up to 
their tricks with the others and absolutely dying to compromise— 
had we gone there, we might well have found everything settled in 
advance. The confidential report of the General Council can 
hardly be entrusted to such a congress 672 in extenso.  Incidentally, 
the others are also making a rather poor beginning with only 30 
members! 671 
I had given my agreement to Le Moussu on 2 matters 
unconnected with each other 3: 
1. to advance him the £23 for his patent, whatever the 
situation; 
2. if Lafargue were to leave him in the lurch, or back out of his 
own accord, or if there were to be a separation in any other form 
that would not prejudice my relations with Lafargue—then I 
would enter into negotiations with him and Mooreb  on the same 
basis as they had established with Lafargue previously. It seems to 
follow from your letter that the terms of the separation were such 
that Lafargue cannot reproach me with anything if I take his place 
and go into partnership with Le Moussu. If this is right—and your 
opinion on this will be entirely sufficient for me—then Moore and Le 
Moussu can come and visit me in the evening, when I have to be 
in because of Andrews, and we can talk the matter over. But if he 
has to have the money for the patent immediately, he must let me 
know at once, since I would have to go to London right away to 
see to it. 
My congratulations on your NARROW ESCAPE.0 Unfortunately, such 
fits cannot be produced to order with any certainty. The raspberry 
vinegar, and even more solid bodies, might have got into your 
wind-pipe a hundred times over without provoking the same 
symptoms. 
Have written to Hepner.730 
Would you inform Le Moussu of what I said above, if you 
believe that I can do it with a good conscience vis-à-vis Lafargue? 
It should be made clear, incidentally, that my offer only refers to 
Lafargue's position in 'Moore & Le Moussu'. The other affair— 
the big printing works—should be abandoned for the time being, if 
only for commercial reasons. We shall have enough on our hands, 
for the moment at least, with exploiting the patent  itself.  I shall 
explain all this when I come.

ENGELS TO JOHN DE MORGAN 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] [London, around 18 September 1873] 
Dear Citizen! 
On Monday2 I found the letter from you which Miss Carroll 
had left at my house.732 That day and Tuesday I was so much 
engaged on French refugee and International business that I 
could not attend even to the most pressing portion of my own 
affairs, nor find time to reply to the numerous letters found here 
on my return to town. Otherwise I should at once have written to 
you that I could not take the chair for her next Sunday. 
On Tuesday as I was just on the point of going out on business 
which admitted of no delay and must be settled before 1 o'clock 
that day, Miss Carroll called again. It was half past twelve and I 
had above a mile to walk to the place. If a dozen of my oldest 
friends had arrived from the other end of the world, I could not 
have seen them at that moment where I had not five minutes to 
spare. I must have treated them as I treated Miss Carroll. 
On telling her as politely as I could my momentous situation, 
she merely asked me categorically whether yes or no, I would take 
the chair for her; I regretted I could not, as I had an engagement 
for that evening, and again expressed my sorrow for having to 
leave her so abruptly; upon which she at once interrupted me, 
leaving me not even the time to ask her when and where I could 
have another interview with her, by saying that she was quite used 
to that sort of thing on the part of the London Internationals, and 
walked out of the house. 
I felt sorry for her, attributing her behaviour to the exaggerated 
touchiness often brought on by misfortune. Unfortunately, the 
would-be insulting letter she wrote to me since, leaves me no room 
to doubts as to what is hidden behind all this virtuous indigna­
tion. 
As to taking the chair on Sunday I was compelled to decline the 
honour.

1) because, as stated, I had a previous engagement; 
2) because, contrary to your expectation, I do not recollect 
having heard Miss Carroll's name once before, nor could I get any 
further information from one or two others I asked.3 And I 
cannot be expected to take the chair for parties of whom I know 
nothing or next to nothing. 
3) I never took the chair at a public meeting of Englishmen and 
do not intend doing so. When I once took the chair for you, that 
was at the meeting of a German private society of which I was a 
member. 
At all events this little incident15 will not have been without its 
use, if you will see from it the impropriety of proposing people 
for chairmen using their names without having previously 
obtained their consent. 
Yours fraternally

But NEVER MIND.—We needn't fall out over this; however, you

nothing and I do not think that he was greatly interested.

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 187 
IN HOBOKEN 
[London,] 27 September 1873 
Dear Sorge, 
My wife has written you a number of letters about my state of 
health. There was a serious possibility of my succumbing to 
apoplexy and I am still suffering greatly from headaches, so that 
I must severely restrict my working time. This is the sole reason 
for my long silence. As far as I can recollect, I have only written 
one letter to New York, and that was to Bolte* since it seemed to 
me from your letter that I might usefully intervene to smooth the 
troubled waters and clarify matters. 
The fiasco of the Geneva Congress672 was unavoidable. From 
the moment it became known here that no delegates would be 
coming from America, it was clear that matters were going awry. 
The attempt had been made in Europe to represent you as mere 
figureheads. If you had not put in an appearance and instead we 
had turned up, this would have been interpreted as confirmation 
of the rumour anxiously put about by our adversaries. It also 
would have passed as proof that your American Federation existed 
only on paper. 
Furthermore, the British Federation was unable to scrape 
enough money together for a single delegate; the Portuguese, the 
Spaniards and Italians notified us that in the circumstances they 
could not send any delegates directly. The news from Germany, 
Austria and Hungary was just as bad and participation by the 
French was out of the question. 
It was a foregone conclusion therefore that, under the 
circumstances, the great majority at the Congress would have 
consisted of Swiss—moreover, of local Genevans. From Geneva 
itself we had heard nothing; Outine was no longer there, old 
Beckerb  persisted in an obstinate silence and Mr Perret wrote once 
or twice to create a false impression. 
At the very last moment a letter arrived for the British Federal 
Council from the Romance Committee in Geneva727 couched in 
sentimentally conciliatory terms. In it the Genevans firstly refuse 
a See this volume, pp. 474-76. - b  Johann Philipp Becker

to accept English mandates and then enclose a leaflet (signed by 
Perret, Duval, etc.) directly attacking the Hague Congress and the 
former General Council in London. In some respects the fellows 
even go further than the Jurassians, e.g. they call for the 
expulsion of the so-called brain-workers. (The nicest thing about the 
whole business is that this piece of nonsense was written by that 
miserable MILITARY ADVENTURER Cluseret (who in Geneva describes 
himself as the founder of the 'International' in America). The 
gentleman wanted to have the General Council in Geneva in order 
to run a secret dictatorship from there.) 
This letter, together with its enclosure, arrived just in time to 
keep Serraillier from setting off for Geneva,724 and to induce him 
to protest against the activities of the fellows there (as did the 
British Federal Council) and to inform them in advance that their 
congress would be treated as nothing more than a local Genevan 
event. It was very good that no one turned up there whose 
presence might have cast doubt on such a view of the congress. 
Notwithstanding this state of affairs the Genevans failed in their 
bid to gain control of the General Council, but they have, as you 
will be aware, managed to nullify all the work done since the first 
Geneva Congress738 and even to carry through numerous meas­
ures running counter to the resolutions adopted there. 
As I view European conditions, it is quite useful to let the 
formal organisation of the International recede into the back­
ground for the time being, but, if possible, not to relinquish 
control of the central point in New York so that no idiots like 
Perret or ADVENTURERS like Cluseret may seize the leadership and 
discredit the whole business. Events and the inevitable develop­
ment and intertwining of things will of themselves see to it that 
the International rises again in an improved form. For the present 
it suffices not to let the connection with the most capable in the 
various countries slip altogether out of our hands and for the rest 
not to give a jot for the Geneva local decisions, to simply ignore 
them. The only good decision adopted there, to postpone the 
Congress for 2 years, facilitates this mode of action. Furthermore 
it upsets the calculations of the Continental governments, the 
spectre of the International refusing, just now, to be of service to 
them in the impending reactionary crusade; indeed, the bourgeois 
everywhere consider the spectre dead and buried. 
Apropos. It is absolutely essential that the account book with the 
records of how the monies were managed for the refugees of the 
Commune is sent back to us. We simply cannot do without it if we 
are to justify ourselves against slanderous insinuations. It was

something completely unconnected with the general function of 
the General Council and in my view it should never have left our 
hands. 
I hope that the American PANIC does not get too much out of hand 
and so have too great a repercussion on England and hence on 
Europe. General periodic crises are always preceded by such partial 
ones.  If they are too violent they only preempt the general crisis and 
take the sting out of it.

After long hesitation and after receiving lukewarm reports from 
some places and no news at all from others, Marx and I had come 
to the conclusion that the Congress672  would become essentially a 
local Swiss affair and that since no one would be able to come over 
directly from America, we would do best to stay away too. (An 
additional factor was that no mandates arrived for either Marx or 
myself,  apart from the alternative one from America.) As soon as 
this had definitively been agreed, I went off to the seaside at 
Ramsgate 723 to join my family, a break I needed urgently in view 
of my constant insomnia and nervous irritability. While I was 
there, Marx wrote to me about the sudden revelations about the 
treachery of the Genevans a which made it necessary to decide that 
neither should Serraillier attend the Congress.724 This was pretty 
clear to me from Marx's letter and I agreed to it on condition that 
Serraillier should inform you at once.b A few days later I went to 
London for 24 hours in order to pay the Alliance" printerd and to 
organise the distribution. I had a look at the relevant documents 
and became convinced that it would have been the greatest folly 
for Serraillier to have gone there as your representative. Our 
absence and his, together with that of every German with one 
exception^ stamped the Congress as a merely local assembly which 
still looked respectable enough when compared to the Alliance,671 
but which could lay no claim to any moral authority vis-à-vis the 
International. Furthermore, the general world situation was such 
that any congress was bound to end badly, as we can see from the 
fact that by now both the congress of the Alliance and that of the 
International have completely been forgotten. WELL, I urged Marx 
to let you know at once and went off again, and until I received 
your present letter, I assumed that this had been done. For his 
part, Marx had thought that Serraillier would have given you the 
first news when he sent back the money and that he could 
therefore wait until he was in a position to give you information 
about the results of the Congress, etc. 
Instead of that, Serraillier gave the money to Lafargue for safe 
keeping, as we discovered only last week, and I shall get it from 
Lafargue in the next few days and take care of the matter. I am 
very busy looking through the—extremely bad—German transla­
tion of the Alliance pamphlet, which has been sent to me— Bracke 
is bringing it out in Brunswick. 735 What I have of your version has

been very helpful in correcting the other one. Of course, the 
matter is urgent and I have to work through it as the manuscript 
has to go back this week. 
Marx and his youngest daughter3 went to Harrogate in 
Yorkshire yesterday; both of them are to spend some time there 
convalescing.736 He needed it badly; the severe symptoms he had 
felt in the spring had vanished, but chronic brain pressure 
set in, which made him unable to work and unwilling to write, and 
which, if allowed to go unchecked for too long, might have serious 
consequences. During the next few days he will go and see our 
friend Gumpert in Manchester, the only doctor in whom he has 
complete confidence and who also looked after him in the spring. 
His condition is another reason why you have had to wait so long 
for a reply. 
Bakunin's answer to the pamphlet has been to send the Journal 
de Genève and the Jurassians a statement announcing his political 
demise 737: I withdraw— dorénavant je ne troublerai plus personne et je 
ne demande que ce qu'on me laisse tranquille à mon tour^ He is gravely 
mistaken in this. Apart from that, not the slightest attempt to 
reply to anything. 
Outine has been here for 4 weeks or so and has told us still 
more wonderful stories about Bakunin. The fellow has really put 
his catechism738 into practice; for years now he and his Alliance10 
have lived exclusively from blackmail, relying on the fact that 
nothing could be put into print about this without compromising 
other people who have to be taken into account. You have no idea 
what a low-down gang they are. That aside, their pseudo-
International is as quiet as a mouse; the pamphlet has exposed 
their frauds and Messrs Guillaume & Co. will have to let the dust 
settle first. In Spain they have put an end to themselves, see my 
article in the Volksstaat. c 
The real International is equally silent. I have still not had an 
answer from Mesa, to whom I wrote in September.45 In Portugal 
they are all being persecuted and have to watch their step. In Italy 
a section has been formed in Melegnano,739 a fact I herewith bring 
to the attention of the General Council; for the address see below. 
The Plebe is still coming out, but very irregularly and with a 
strong emphasis on mediation. That is all I have to report. The 
federation here, having been badly shaken by Jung, Hales & Co., is 
a Eleanor - b henceforth I shall interfere with no one and in return ask only that 
others should leave me in peace too. - c  F. Engels, 'The Bakuninists at Work'.

ENGELS TO MARX 81 
IN HARROGATE736 
[London,] 29 November 1873 
Dear Moor, 
Lopatin left for Paris again yesterday evening. He intends to 
come here in a month or two, at which time Lavrov too will move 
in with his printing shop, unless he changes his mind on account 
of the expense, a matter to which I particularly drew Lopatin's 
attention. 
It is unlikely that Lopatin and Outine will ever be very firm 
friends, their temperaments are not really compatible and the 
shadow of their first cool encounter in Geneva still weighs down 
on them. Moreover, Lopatin remains a great Russian patriot and 
still treats the pyccKoe 4Uoa as something special, having 
nothing to do with the West, and is hardly grateful to Outine for 
having initiated us into its mysteries. In addition, Lopatin has just 
passed through Lavrov's hands and coming fresh, as he does, 
from the solitude of Siberia,740 may well be fair game for the 
latter's befuddled dreams of reconciliation. 
On the other hand, he is fed up to the back teeth with the 
a (Russ.) Russian cause 

=====第574页=====
540 320. Engels to Marx. 29 November 1873 
whole Russian emigration nonsense and wants to have nothing 
further to do with it whereas Outine, despite and because of his 
hostility to the gang, is still up to his ears in all their gossip and 
thinks every last fart a matter of importance. He is absolutely 
furious because Lopatin wants to have Chernyshevsky's manuscript 
that you know about3  printed not by Trusov but by Lavrov, parce 
que cela leur donne du prestige b\ 
So in my view it is of no great significance whether Lopatin 
takes Elpidin, for example, not for a sophisticated rogue, but for a 
simple ass. Even though it was precisely the indiscreet remarks of 
this same Elpidin to a certain Fedetzki or Feletzki, and the latter's 
inability to hold his tongue, that put the Russian government 
wise to Lopatin's presence in Irkutsk and so brought about his 
arrest. 
When Lopatin arrived at Irkutsk, Chernyshevsky was 'quite close 
by', i.e. 700-800 English miles further on near Nerchinsk, but was 
straightaway removed to Srednevilyuisk, to the north of Yakutsk, 
65° latitude, where, apart from the indigenous Tungus, the only 
company he has are the non-commissioned officer and the 
2 soldiers who guard him. 
Having escaped in July, Lopatin remained in hiding in Irkutsk 
for a month, ending up in the house of the very man who had 
been ordered to discover his hiding place. He then travelled on his 
own telega" to Tomsk, disguised as a peasant and doing the 
driving  himself;  from there he went by steamer, from Tobolsk by 
post-horse and finally by train to St Petersburg, still dressed as a 
peasant. There he stayed in hiding for another month, after which

this chapter has been rendered into elegant French, I still felt 
regret at what had been lost from the beautiful chapter. Its vigour 
and vitality and life have gone to the devil. The chance for an 
ordinary writer to express himself with a certain elegance has been 
purchased by castrating the language. It is becoming increasingly 
impossible to think originally in the strait-jacket of modern 
a N. G. Chernyshevsky, 'ÜHCbMa 6e3i> a^peca' (Letters Without an Address). -

French. Everything striking or vital is removed if only by the need, 
which has become essential almost everywhere, to bow to the 
dictates of a pedantic formal logic and change round the 
sentences. I would think it a great mistake to take the French 
version as a model for the English translation. In English the 
power of expression in the original does not need to be toned 
down; whatever has inevitably to be sacrificed in the genuinely 
dialectical passages can be made up in others by the greater 
energy and brevity of the English language. 
Apropos, how does Mr Kokosky set about excusing his bad 
translation735 ? By claiming that I write in that 'Liebknecht/ Marxian 
style'  that is so hard to capture! What a compliment! 
Tussy's letter arrived yesterday evening. Shall answer it tomorrow, 
so that you don't receive everything on one day. 
What does Gumpert have to say?

IN LONDON 
[Harrogate,] 30 November 1873 
DEAR FRED, 
On Thursday3 I went to see Gumpert whom I found very bald 
and aged. The poor fellow suffers terribly from haemorrhoidal 
convolution he has had for ages and for which he at long 
last intends to have an operation, something which, as he admits 
himself,  always involves a certain degree of danger. I dined at his 
home (apart from him I could not, of course, see anyone in the

few hours I had in Manchester) together with his four self-made 
children and their GOVERNESS. 
Gumpert examined me BODILY and found a certain elongation of 
the liver which according to him I cannot get rid of completely 
until I go to Carlsbad.3  I have to take the same water as Tussy 
(they call it Kissingen water here, on account of its resemblance to 
the real things), but none of the mineral baths. Apart from that 
my regime and Tussy's are somewhat different. She may only walk 
in great moderation—a point on which Gumpert is wholly in 
agreement with Tussy's local doctor, Dr Myrtle (a very sweet-
smelling name, the man is a Scot and boasts himself a Jacobite 745 to 
this very day; he should get to know COLONEL Stuart chez Don 
Carlos); I, on the other hand, am supposed to go on vigorous 
marches. Gumpert's advice to do very little was scarcely necessary, 
since up to now I have actually done nothing, not even written 
letters. I had imagined that two weeks here would suffice, but 
Gumpert insisted on three. And in fact Tussy will not be able to 
take a much stronger mineral bath than she has been taking so far 
until the middle of next week. 
Apropos. Gumpert has not received the Alliance pamphletb that I 
sent him; in general, there have been many complaints in 
Manchester about the failure of the post to deliver PAPERS and 
PRINTS.  So send him one by return; ditto a copy of your articles on 
Spainc  printed in the Volksstaat, if you have received them yet. 
Gumpert says that all these things interest him greatly, and that 
we must help to keep him au courant by sending him things from 
London, as otherwise he will completely go to seed among the 
Manchester philistines. 
I am very sorry that the good Lopatin has missed me; but how 
lucky he has been in his misfortune.740 When he moves to London 
we shall protect him against Lavrov's  SOFT-SAWDER.d 
There was a storm here yesterday (although on the whole the 
air is extremely invigorating) and I caught a bad cold which has 
kept me indoors today, in accordance with the maxim: Principiis 
obsta.' 
Our lune-de-miell  couple, about whom Tussy has already told 
you, were so horribly bored in the first 3 days—they are called 
Briggs incidentally—that the young husband prescribed a friend, 
a Czech name: Karlovy Vary. - b K. Marx and F. Engels, The Alliance of Socialist

a devil with a limp, who arrived yesterday. Since then they seem 
LIVELIER, to judge by the noise they are making. Tussy and I took 
refuge in chess yesterday evening. Apart from that I have been 
reading Sainte-Beuve's book on Chateaubriand,* an author I have 
always disliked. If the man has become so famous in France it 
must be because he is in every respect the most classical 
incarnation of French vanité, a vanité not decked out in the 
light-hearted and frivolous garb of the 18th century, but strutting 
about in a romantic disguise and newly minted idioms; the 
spurious profundity, Byzantine exaggeration, the coquettishness 
with regard to the feelings, the flamboyant schillerising, WORD-
PAINTING,  theatrical,  SUBLIME—in  a word it is hotchpotch of lies never 
before achieved in either form or content. 
It is very kind of Mr Kokosky to have invented a 
Liebknecht/Marxian style.b But it seems to refer to Liebknecht's 
French style, with which we are unacquainted. His German style is, 
after all, just as uncouth as that of Mr Kokosky and must please 
and appeal to him for that very reason. 
Now that you are taking a look at the French translation of 
Capital,436 I would be grateful if you could persevere with it. 
I think you will find that some passages are superior to the Ger­
man.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN HARROGATE 
[London,] 5 December 1873 
Dear Moor, 
I would have written to you yesterday as agreed, but I had the 
pleasure of a visit from your esteemed  associé,  Mr Le Moussu, from 3 
to 6 p.m., who honoured me with a list of his complaints. Have no 
fear, I do not intend to take my revenge by repeating the entire 
rigmarole. 719 I have urged them both to keep the peace (Moorea  a 
week ago, Le Moussu yesterday) and pointed out that they were 
now married and would simply have to get along with each other. 
They are two of the oddest fellows one could hope to find, each 
with a boundless idea of himself and his achievements, but each in 
his own speciality, and since their specialities are different, each 
criticises the other to perfection. I gave Moore £5 last week and 
another £5 to Le Moussu yesterday, reminding him of his duty to 
take no more than half for  himself.  He found this somewhat 
disagreeable, but since Moore did not come but sent him instead, it 
was my duty to do so after all that had taken place. Le Moussu 
then said that £10 were still owing on the patent and that would 
exhaust the £160. I can give them another £5 next week, if you 
authorise me to do so, in the event that no money comes in; but I 
shall categorically demand that Moore should get Longuet to cash 
it, since there have been enough remittances from October which, 
when cashed, should keep the machine going. If you could write a 
brief note to Moore along the same lines, it would be of help. And 
if they pester you with letters, just write and say that they simply 
must get along together until your return. That would do very 
nicely since all the GRIEVANCES are by no means as pressing as they 
make out. 
Have sent the Alliance reportb to Gumpert. What does he say 
about your head? I hope you have got rid of your cold. 
I am now in a position to pay the £100 due at Christmas. 
Should I give it all to your wife, or just part and the rest to you on 
your return? And also, since you are staying 3 weeks, you will 
need more money for there; IF  SO. SAY HOW MUCH, RECKONING LIBERALLY.

I had commissioned Aston over a fortnight ago to sell some 
SHARES but there are NO BUYERS for this special sort. If I manage to 
get rid of them (and I shall be seeing him tomorrow), your debts 
can be settled without delay, otherwise we shall have to wait until 
the beginning of February, when I have prospects of further 
money. 
For your amusement I am sending you a pamphlet on banks," 
belonging to Utin. It is by Geffcken, a Strasbourg professor. What 
clever-clever people they are! And they only quote members of 
their own lousy gang, authorities like Augspurg (who has ever 
heard of the Jew?) and the great Wagner of whom it is said: 
'It the Tosafoth Yom Tobh no longer valid? 
What is valid? Murder! Murder!'744 
Utin has left a whole pile of such pamphlets here, it's fantastic 
stuff,  SERVES HIM RIGHT if he relies on his bookseller to make the 
choice. Judging them just by the titles,3/4 of them are only fit for 
the W.C., and significantly, not a single one of them has had its 
pages cut. 
More soon on the French translation.436 Up to now I find that 
what you have revised is indeed better than the German, but 
neither French nor German has anything to do with that. Best of 
all is the note on Mill,745  quant au style. b 
Enclosed an excerpt on the way in which mechanical energy is 
transformed into heat in the human body. Busch is one of the 
leading contemporary surgeons. The phenomenon described here 
also explains the claim made by both sides at the start of the war c 
that—in violation of military convention—the enemy was using 
dumdum bullets. Busch's cool account certainly puts one in mind 
of the old warning: do not play with firearms. A nice business 
when your own brain smashes open your skull.746

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN LONDON 
[Harrogate,] 7 December 1873 
Dear Engels, 
Of the £60 you gave me, ABOUT £23 remained for my journey 
(having made payments as follows: £10 to Moore" et Co.; 
instalments: £5 to BEERMAN, £5 to GROCER, £5 to Withers, £2.l7sh. 
interest to the pawnbrokers, £4 dress, boots, etc., for Tussy, £5 
left for my wife). With £10 more I shall have LARGELY enough, but 
will need £12 if I return via Manchester, as I promised Gumpert, 
and stay there for 2 days. 
Be so good as to give my wife only £20 of the £100, and keep 
the £80 for me in reserve, as I have to make major payments on 3 
and 16 January and would not like to expose her to the 
temptation of paying off less urgent debts. 
The £5 will just have to be shoved down the throat of the Co.719 
I shall write to Moore today about collecting the remittances. 
My COLD, which was damned SEVERE, has not yet gone completely, 
and I am still downing the medicine which Gumpert prescribed 
me from Manchester as soon as he heard of it. I hope it will be 
cured in 1-2 days. But you can see from the fact that I have not 
felt so well for years, despite this irksome, dizzy-making incident, 
what an extraordinarily beneficial effect the air here and the 
peaceful life have had on me (I have done absolutely no work 
whatsoever). 
I caught the  COLD  through following too literally Gumpert's 
advice to take vigorous exercise after drinking the waters. It 
should have been clear from the state of the sky that a storm was 
to be expected. 
The cure is doing Tussychen a world of good. Likewise the 
regimen which prescribes bed by 11 o'clock at the latest. 
The table of contents of De Paepe's planned magnum opus 747 
features, as the main section of Book 2, données  physiologiques 11: 
'Analysis of Labour Power and Physiological Conditions of Its Existence.' 1. Karl 
Marx's theory of labour power, necessary labour and surplus labour.—The great 
economic and social significance of this theory; 2. Physiological analysis of what 
a George Moore - b physiological data 

=====第581页=====
323. Marx to Engels. 7 December 1873 547 
Marx calls labour power or the power of the labourer.—This force comprises three 
principal elements: the power of the nerves, the power of the muscles, the power 
of the senses." 
You see how he thus takes the opportunity to enter medical 
territory. The section ends: 
14. How the foregoing physiological data enable us to determine, as precisely as 
possible, the value of labour power as the basis of all exchange value and the 
foundation of all economic science. 
The last sounds like a misunderstanding. Then comes the 
theory of population under the heading: 'Data furnished by the 
study of the functions of reproduction.' I see from the table of 
contents that because of the delays in publishing the French 
translation of Capital,456 he is unfamiliar with what has been done 
there and hence has been unable to appropriate it in any way. 
The recalcitrance of the Cuban SLAVEHOLDERS is a GODSEND; it would 
be highly undesirable for the matter to drift on so indecisively. 
Moreover, any unpleasant complication that overtakes Castelar et 
Co. is to be welcomed. 748 
Have you read the Pope'sb Encyclical in which, very transparent­
ly, our handsome Williamc is compared to the Roman Emperors 
who persecuted the Apostles and followers of Christ?749 
The Left in the French Assembly will probably find itself 
subjected to special regulations. The scoundrels are reluctant to walk 
out en masse, for that would mean the end of the security which is 
the citizen's prime duty, as well as the official position of 
importance and the parliamentary remuneration, etc. 
Gumpert wants to know when you are next going to show 
yourself in Manchester? I have reassured him by saying that you 
would in all likelihood come up on business in the spring.

That good-for-nothing Roderich Benedix has left a bad odour 
behind in the shape of a thick tome against 'Shakespearomania'.b 
In it he has proved to a nicety that Shakespeare can't hold a 
candle to our great poets, not even to those of modern times. 
Shakespeare is apparently to be hurled down from his pedestal so 
that fat-arsed Benedix can be hoisted into his place. However, the 
first act of the Merry Wives0 alone contains more life and reality 
than all German literature, and Launced  with his dog Crab is 
alone worth more than all the German comedies put together. By 
way of contrast, the ponderous posterior R. Benedix will indulge 
in considerations as serious as they are cheap over the casual 
manner in which Shakespeare often makes short work of his 
dénouements and thereby cuts short the tedious twaddle that in 
reality is nevertheless unavoidable. Habeat sibi. e

The halves of the notes have arrived, for which BEST THANKS. I

send off the still missing 25 copies of the Alliance* to New York. 
While you had fog up there, there was real spring weather 
down here, and air of a purity such as we are not accustomed to 
having in England. 
Roderich Benedix comes as no surprise to me.c If he and those 
like him understood their Shakespeare, where would they get the 
courage to display their own 'wares' to the public? 
Things are going badly for Bazaine.751  The Orléans have no 
cheaper way to exhibit their own patriotism than by such an act of 
brutality against a Bonapartist general. The Due d'Aumale is a

IN PENZANCE 
[London,] 23 December 1873 
1 Maitland Park Road, N.W. 
My dear and honoured friend, 
I felt very anxious about your protracted silence, Mr Leblanc 
being unable to inform me of your whereabouts and your doings. 
I am sorry to see from your letter that my apprehensions were not 
quite unfounded, but the mild climate of Penzance and your 
robust constitution will, I hope fervently so, soon rid you of the 
cough which, by the by, sways it now all over the country. It is, in 
the current phrase, quite a seasonable nuisance. 
My youngest daughter3 and myself have for three weeks stayed 
at Harrogate736 whither our medical adviserb had sent us. The 
quiet life, breezy air, mineral waters and pleasant walks of the 
place have gone far to restore the health of the two patients. 
When we arrived, the season had already gone, so that we 
occupied our hotel 'in single blessedness',0 being only disturbed 
and somewhat amused during the last days of our sojourn by the 
dropping in of a Church of England parson, a worldly wise old 
man, with no smack of cant about him, of fluent and trivial talk, 
with conventional varnish of manners and caring indeed for 
nothing save his belly. He was the true model of a modern 
Christian, using that word itself only with respect to the dishes our 
hotel-keeper provided and saying for instance: this is no Christian 
mutton chop, if that same chop happened to lack some virtue or 
other. The man had overrun most countries of Europe and was in 
himself a recording office of all the merits and demerits of its 
several hotels, always hunting in vain for that paragon of 
mankind—a perfect man—cook. At the same time he never tired 
of bitter sarcasms against the overstrained pretentions and the 
extravagant living of the miners of the black country,"1 being 
himself an incumbent at Durham. This man gave me and Eleanor 
constant occasion to think and speak of you, because a more 
striking contrast could hardly be fancied—you, so to say an

anticipation of what the men of the new society will be, and he, 
the parson, a stereotyped mould of what the men of the old 
society have contrived to become. 
I send you to-day three further parts of the Capital3 which, on 
the whole, are less abstract than the preceding ones. If they 
contribute to enliven your hours of seclusion, I shall feel most 
happy. In general, I must say that my views commence to spread 
amongst the workmen of the Continent and that there the upper 
classes and the official representatives of political economy make 
much noise about them and feel rather annoyed at them. 
In poor Spain things might still right themselves if French 
reaction gets not the upper hand. With all their shortcomings 
there is mettle in the Spaniards. The downbreak of the Spanish 
working class rising—which was unripe and senseless75—will 
prove useful if its leaders have been taught by dearly bought 
experience to emancipate themselves from highflown but hollow 
French phraseology and to apply themselves to the study of the 
real conditions of the movement. We have some excellent men at 
Madrid and Valencia. At Lisbon we have a nucleus of really 
superior workers. 
In the United States our propaganda has been much accelerated 
by the crisis. It has acted as our recruiting officer. 
In Germany we are pretty sure to send at the coming elections 
at least a dozen intelligent and energetic workmen to parlia­
ment.754 The sudden and mighty industrial development in that 
country is our best agent. Bismarck and the middle class intend 
striking a blow at the proletarian press, the 'respectable' press 
confessing its inability to cope with it, but the old kingb is rapidly 
sinking and his successor0 cannot dare inaugurate his regime by 
unpopular measures. 
In Russia, what with the social disorganisation consequent upon 
the emancipation of the serfs755 and the awful growth of financial 
disease, what with the popular discontent at the loss of the Russian 
prestige through the Prussian achievements and the hesitations of 
a weak home-policy making half-concessions to-day to compensate 
them by ultra-reactionary measures to-morrow, the elements of a 
general convulsion are accumulating. 
Thus,  my dear friend, the world is moving with all that. What 
are the feeble efforts of upper class France at a moment where the

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, 10 August 1870] 
Dear Mr Engels, 
Moor and Jenny sailed off for Ramsgate yesterday morning, 53 in 
order to see whether there is anywhere for us to put up our tents. 
I greatly fear that the rent will be enormous. I have been to see 
the house-agent, MR Smith, several times already in order to spur 
him into action.24 He claims to have taken all the necessary steps 
and to have written to the owner in Manchester. No reply has 
been forthcoming from that fine gentleman, who seems to be in 
no hurry at all about the business. Smith thinks, however, that you 
are not running a risk of any kind and that there is time enough 
to settle the matter for you. He promised to write to me again, but 
since I have not heard anything further so far, I shall go and see 
him again tomorrow and not mince words. 
Lafargue has just sent a number of French papers and I enclose 
a copy of Le Soir for you here. It may contain something 
useful for your military articles. 3 You cannot imagine what a 
sensation these have been making here! They really have made 
everything wonderfully clear and vivid, and I cannot but think of 
you as the jeuneb Moltke. 
The nauseating vituperation in the Figaro, etc., really passes 
beyond all  belief.  They want to devour the vandals, bones and all, 
for having had the impudence to concentrate their forces and dare 
to set foot in the sol sacré de la patrie. 0 They all deserve to be 
thrashed by the Prussians; for all the French, even the tiny

number  of better ones, have  an element  of chauvinism  in some 
remote corner  of their hearts. This will have  to be  knocked  out of 
them. Even here  in our  house, where there  was  also  a bit of 
chauvinism, there  is now  just indignation about these gentry with 
their CIVILIS-A-A-ATION  and  their ideas which they were kind enough 
to try and  import into Germany, which  is no sol  sacré. 
From  the  stamps  on the  papers which Laura  has  sent,  I see to 
my horror that they  are  still in Levallois-Perret  and  hence close  to 
the fortifications.3  We  have long since warned them  to leave Paris 
and take little Schnäpschen b to Bordeaux.  But  they won't listen, 
and I hope they won't have  to pay for it. I  shall close  now so as to 
catch  the  post  and at the  same time  to rush  for the  Pall Mall  to 
see whether there  are not any  NOTES  ON  THE  WAR by 'Z' in it. 
Yesterday they printed your article 0 as the  FIRST LEADER,  SO as to 
make even more capital  out of it  politically. 
The  PEACE LEAGUE  6 donated £20 to the International yesterday 
to distribute  the  Address 0 in Germany  and  France.  I don't know 
whether Moor will  be happy about Wilhelmchen's e translation. 
The French translation  of the  braves Beiges1  is quite wretched;  in

arrived from  the  braves suisses.

ELEANOR MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[Ramsgate,] 12 August 1870 
36 Hardres Street 
My dear Engels, 
You will see from the address that we are once more at 
Ramsgate. 53 I suppose you know that last Tuesday 3 Mohr and 
Jenny went to look for houses.—Mama and I left London 
yesterday, and after a very pleasant journey arrived here safe and 
sound. I say a pleasant journey, though I dont think Mama thought 
so. The sea was very rough, the waves washing over the ship and 
wetting everybody.—All the passengers with the exception of one 
lady,  myself,  and several gentlemen, were sea-sick. This lady and I 
climbed up just by the side of the Captain's deck, and there we sat 
down. It was great fun. This morning I turned out before six 
o'clock in the morning and walked about till nine. I intend to go 
to the sands now and take a good bath.—Yesterday Papa had a 
letter from Kugelmann. —He writes about that book to which 
Rossa's likeness is to be prefixed. 74 He thanks very much for what 
you wrote,b but says he has not got the likeness.— Now Jane sent it 
shortly after your preface was sent—so I suppose they didn't get 
it. Would you mind sending them your copy—you know that one 
that was given with The Irishman.—We shall be much obliged to 
you if you will.—Now I must finish, for I'm in a hurry to go out 
again, so with best love to all 
Believe me to be 
Your affectionate 
Tussy

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
Ramsgate [around 18 August 1870] 
36 Hardres Street 
Dear Mr Engels, 
I am enclosing a letter from Lafargue which will certainly be of 
interest to you. It is the first time in ages that we have heard from 
them and so we now know that they do not intend to take part in 
the siège. That is one consolation at least. All the news from Paris 
is really frightful. If the grrrande nation had attacked at the right 
time,  they would have been spared the régime of Eugénie 3 and 
Palikao now. Isn't it scandalous that they simply continue to keep 
Rochefort in jail, the only intelligent politician among the whole of 
the jeune France b? The fact is that they deserve the Prussian rod 
even more than one might have supposed. 
I really am furious about the business with the house24 and 
just do not know how you can get around the marquis. Perhaps a 
letter to MR Smith would be of more use than my personal 
intervention. He constantly shifts all the responsibility for the 
delay away from himself and onto the shoulders of the sub-agent. 
The whole affair is in a complete muddle. 
Yesterday evening there was heavy rain here so that Moor could 
not go out for his evening walk. This morning the sun is shining 
splendidly again. I am convinced that the marvellous sea air here 
would help him to recover completely if only he didn't have this 
wretched rheumatism that keeps him from walking and sleeping. 
Last night, though, he had a much better time of it, and after 
lunch he again went to 'BYE-BYES' for a while, as we call the siestas. 
The girls are constantly by, in, near or on the sea and have red 
cheeks and even redder noses, but otherwise are very well and 
cheerful. Only both are suffering greatly on account of the 
DOWNBREAK of their favourite nations. Jenny is totally 'FRENCH' and 
Tussy 'IRISH'. And Pigott really has behaved like a madman. 
'E. M.' is not Tussy. However, today she intends to send the ass an 
excerpt from the Liberté in which the French explicitly reject all 
assistance and enthusiasm on the part of the Irish, since they

their torchlight processions and demonstrations.

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, around 13 September 1870] 
Dear Mr Engels, 
Warmest thanks for your kind long and interesting letter.45 
To come back to the subject of our house,24 I am sorry that you 
were put to the trouble of writing once again. The position with 
the wallpapering is as follows: Smith and the other agent said they 
were prepared to paper the room if you desired it; they both 
thought, however, that the red wallpaper, once it had been 
cleaned, mended and generally renovated, would be preferable to 
any other cheaper one, that it was 3 times as expensive as the one 
in the FRONT  ROOM  and that it was a genuine DINING  ROOM  paper. So I 
went back with Lenchenb to have another look at it, as I did not 
trust my own judgment entirely, and Lenchen was definitely of 
'Smith's' opinion and still claims that she prefers it to any other. I 
remained undecided and since I did not really know what to do, I 
waited for your letter. It might perhaps be best if you could look 
at it for yourself and made up your own mind. It will only take a 
day if you want to have a new one. Please let me know what you 
would like to have. Apart from that, the house seemed in good 
REPAIR from top to bottom, and neither of us could find anything

amiss.  Two broken windows were just being replaced and also a 
new robinet* (I can't just think of the German word) on the stone 
sink in the washhouse. Apart from that everything seemed to be in 
good order and I think that the man will replace anything still 
missing without delay. He appeared very willing in every respect. 
At any rate, you must stay with us for a few nights and use our 
house as a base from which to make your ARRANGEMENTS. We shall be 
able to find room for everyone. For our house is a veritable palace 
and much too large and dear for us in my view. 
Serraillier has written a very interesting letter from Paris which 
confirms everything we already knew long since about those 
amiable phrasemongers.b 
Serraillier says you can almost get torn in pieces if you tell the 
truth, and even the better and the best ones are living on their 
memories of 1792. He is absolutely delighted about Rochefort, 
whom he has now seen for the second time, and he has enrolled 
in the home-guard unit du cher Gustave. 0 It might be better not to 
tell Dupont for the moment that Serraillier is helping to defend le 
sol sacré? He might after all start to suffer from le coeur gros" and 
want to be off. Et à quoi bon? 1 With his quick temper Dupont 
would make a fine impression. We have had no news from the 
Lafargues. I am overjoyed that he is SAFE. 
Jenny is feeling better, but is greatly affected by the fate of the 
grrande nation, with which both girlsg are completely infatuated. 
Time will change all that. Indeed, we have all experienced that 
enthusiasm. 
Best regards to your dear wifeh from

JENNY MARX TO PETER IMANDT 100 
IN DUNDEE 
[London, around 13 June 1871] 
1 Maitland Park Road 
My dear Mr Imandt, 
I have just received your letter and make all haste to let you 
know that Moor is 'ALL RIGHT'. The rumours are just a lot of police 
fabrications which Stieber has invented in league with those 
French scoundrels.756 You will be receiving COPIES of the Address of 
the International3 today. Perhaps you can arrange for something 
from it to appear in the press. The girlsb have been with Laura 
for the past 6 weeks.212 They were in Bordeaux at first. But then 
things got too hot for Lafargue. They made their escape from 
there and are now close to the Spanish border;  SAFE,  I hope. 
Your brother also wrote briefly yesterday about Moor's arrest. 
Please tell him what you know. I have my hands full today. 
You cannot imagine, dear Mr Imandt, what we have been 
through, all the misery and anger, during the last few weeks. It 
took more than 20 years to develop such brave, able, heroic men, 
and now almost all of them are lost. There is still hope for some, 
but the best have been murdered. Varlin, Jaclard, Rigault, 
Tridon.757  And above all the true heroes, who fought on without 
leaders for 8 days in Villette, Belleville and St Antoine 0: workers, 
both men and women!! d The despicable loudmouths like Félix Pyat 
will probably save their skins. Others are still in hiding, but I am 
afraid that the bloodhounds will hunt them down. 
With best regards. 
Yours,

JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) 
TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 
IN HANOVER 
[London,] 3 October 1871 
My dear Doctor, 
My best thanks for the portraits you have been kind enough to 
send us. They are excellent copies. I quite agree with you as to 
illustrated paper; but as unfortunately we only had two votes 
between us and as there were many votes against us, I assure you 
I had to fight many a hard battle, and at length only succeeded in 
effecting a compromise—that is to say, both copies have been sent 
to the artist who is going to publish the portrait, and he is to 
decide between them, or to make use of both.768 
I am happy to say it has been possible to persuade Mohr to give 
up work for five days, and to go to the seaside.316 To-day he will 
have to return, as there is a sitting of the International3: mama 
who is with him, writes, that the few days' rest have done him 
much good. And he was sadly in want of rest! To me it is a marvel 
how he has been able to bear all the toil and trouble of these last 
months. 
The work has been, and still is, fearful. Take this day for an 
example. Early this morning there came a letter from an Italian 
section of the International—stating, that the Association is 
making wonderful progress in Italy (I suppose you have seen 
Garibaldi's letter on the Internationalb ), and asking for advice and 
assistance. Then arrived letters from different parts of France, 
and finally a crazy epistle from a Swede, who it seems has run 
mad. 'He calls upon' le grand maître 'to light torches upon the 
mountains in Sweden' etc. Close upon the postman's rap follows a 
ring. An arrival from France—Russia—or Hong Kong! The 
number of refugees here is daily increasing. These poor people 
are in the most heartrending misery—they have not learnt the art 
of Badinguet, c d'Orléans, Gambetta and Co. of providing for the 
a a meeting of the General Council - b  Garibaldi's letter to Arthur Arnold published 
in Der Volksstaat, Nos. 80 and 81, 4 and 7 October 1871. - c Nickname of Louis 
Bonaparte (Napoleon III), who, in 1846, fled from prison in Ham in the clothes of a 
mason by the name of Badinguet.

rainy day—they have come over here without clothes on their 
backs or a farthing in their hands. The winter here will be terrible. 
Your fears with regard to the importation from France of 
mouchards" are but too well founded. Happily, the Council has 
taken its precautions. To give you a proof of the success of those 
precautionary measures, I need only tell you that the International 
held a conference from the I7[th] to the 23-rd, 254 and not a single 
paper knew of it. On the 24-th a banquet wound up the 
proceedings. Mohr was made to preside on the occasion (much 
against his will, as you may imagine), and he had the honour of 
having on his right hand the heroic Polish general Wrôblewski. On 
the other side sat the brother of Dombrowski. b A great many 
members of the Commune were present. From Switzerland, 
Outine and Perret had arrived as delegates, from Belgium, De 
Paepe and five others, from Spain, Lorenzo—a most earnest 
devoted man— Liebknecht and Bebel could not come for want of 
cash. The Conference has transacted very much business. Among 
other questions of course the eternal Swiss squabble cropped up. 
A special Committee 36' was selected to examine the difference. 
The resolutions it has arrived at, will, it is to be hoped, put an end 
to the underhand machinations of the clique Bakounine-
Guillaume-Robin.—The following are some of the resolutions on 
the Swiss affair— 
'Considering 
'That the Alliance de la démocratie socialiste has declared itself dissolved; 
'That in its sitting of the 18th September the Conference has decided that all 
existing organisations of the International Association shall henceforth be obliged to 
designate and constitute themselves simply and exclusively as branches, sections, 
federations, etc., of the International Association with the names of their respective 
localities attached; 
'That the existing branches and societies shall therefore no longer be allowed to 
designate themselves by sectarian names such as Mutualists, Positivists, Collectivists, 
Communists, etc.; 
'That no branch or society already admitted shall any longer be permitted to 
form a separatist body under the name of "section of propaganda", alliance, etc., 
pretending to accomplish special missions distinct from the purpose common to the 
mass of militant proletariat united within the Association, etc.; 
'That henceforth the General Council of the International Association will in 
this sense have to interpret the resolution of the Basle Congress "The General 
Council has the right either to accept or to refuse the affiliation of any new society 
or group pending appeal to the next Congress", etc., etc.'c

to-day. Will you therefore ask her to excuse me, and tell her that 
every word of the report (in the German paper) concerning our 
arrest is untrue. Instead of our having proclaimed our names at 
Luchon, every letter was sent to us to the name of Williams or 
Lafargue. We lived in utter retirement, seeing no one but the 
doctor, of whom alas, we had need during the whole of our stay. 
The stay was sad indeed, for Laura's youngest child was ill during 
the whole time, and after fearful sufferings, died, towards the end 
of July—on the 26-th.—A few days after the child's death, just as 
the Lafargues were able to go out a little, M. de Kératry 
commenced his guerre à outrance 3 against us. Laura who had joined 
her husband at Bosost (in Spain) suffered much—her eldest child b 
fell ill, so ill that she thought it would die—it was suffering from 
dysentery, so prevalent in that part of Spain—and she could not 
move away, as the Spanish and French police were waiting to 
arrest her. The child is a little better now. Paul, meanwhile, had 
escaped by unknown paths into the centre of Spain. Tussy and I 
had been caught on our return from Bosost, arrested, kept close 
prisoners for several days in our house and then taken to the 
gendarmerie-barracks. The letter found on me I had written to 
O'Donovan Rossa. It was an answer to his shamefull condemnation 
in The Irishman of the Communal movement. I expressed my 
surprise that he, of all men, should believe the infamous calumnies 
against the Communists, invented by the wretched police organs 
Le Figaro, Paris-Journal etc. I claimed his sympathy (he is a power 
at New York at this moment) and that of his fellow-countrymen, 
for the heroic champions of a better society—for, I said, 
Irishmen, less than all others, can be interested in the continuation 
of the present state of things, etc. 
With best love to Trautchen and Fränzchen c 
Believe me, dear Doctor, 
Very sincerely yours,

JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) TO LUDWIG AND 
GERTRUD KUGELMANN 
IN HANOVER 
London, 21-22 December 1871 
My dear friends, 
First of all let me thank you for your kind letter, my dear 
Doctor, and ask you to pardon me for hot answering it before this. 
If you knew how much I have had to do of late you would forgive 
me. For the last three weeks I have been running from one 
suburb of London to the other (which is no small undertaking in 
this immense city), and then I have often written letters until one 
o'clock in the morning. The object of these journeys and letters is 

=====第600页=====
566 8. Jenny Marx (daughter) to the Kugelmanns. 21-22 December 1871 
to obtain funds for the support of the refugees.251  Hitherto, alas, 
we have been unsuccessful in our endeavours. The infamous 
calumnies of the shameless newspapermongers have so much 
prejudiced the English against the Communeux, that they are 
generally looked upon with unmitigated horror. Employers will 
have nothing to do with them. The men who had succeeded in 
obtaining engagements under borrowed names, are dismissed so 
soon as it is found out who they are. Poor M. and Mad. Serraillier 
for instance had obtained engagements as French teachers. A few 
days ago, however, they were informed that the services of an 
ex-member of the Commune and of his wife would no longer be 
required. But I can speak of these things from personal 
experience. The Monros, for instance, have broken off all 
connection with me, because they have made the terrible discovery 
that I am the daughter of the pétroleur  chief, 3 who defended the 
iniquitous Communal movement. 
As the refugees cannot find employment, you can imagine to 
what straits they are reduced. Their sufferings are beyond 
description—they are literally starving in the streets of this great 
city—the city, that has carried the chacun pour soib principle to its 
greatest perfection. It is not to be wondered at that Englishmen, 
who consider starvation cases to be part and parcel of their own 
glorious constitution, who look upon the liberty to starve as a 
privilege to be proud of, are not much impressed by the nameless 
misery of foreigners for whom they have no sympathies whatever. 
For more than five months the International has now supported, 
that is to say, has held between life and death the great mass of 
exiles.  But its resources are now exhausted. In this extremity we 
have had the enclosed private circular printed. I have drawn it up, 
and you will see carefully avoided any word or allusion that might 
shock the philistines. 
You can imagine, my dear friends, how much all these 
difficulties and troubles worry poor Mohr. Not only that he has to 
fight with all the Governments of the ruling classes—into the 
bargain, he has hand to hand combats with the 'fat, fair and forty' 
landladies, who attack him, because this or that Communeux hasn't 
paid his rent. Just as he has lost himself in the abstrakten  Gedanken, 11 
in rushes Mrs Smith or Mrs Brown. If only the Figaro knew 
this—what a feuilleton would be offered to his readers'

greatest difficulty to find time to arrange the first chapter of his

book" for the second edition.396 By hook and crook he now hopes 
to be enabled to send it to his publisherb before the end of the 
next week. He has much simplified parts of it. But, I am happy to 
say that in spite of such an ocean of cares, Papa's health is pretty 
good, better than it has generally been at this time of the year. 
Some weeks ago he had an abscess under the arm, but it was not a 
bad one and was soon cured. His cough also has almost left 
him—he only coughs in the morning—(formerly you will 
remember he sometimes coughed during the whole night). 
The successors of the defunct Alliancists10 have not given the 
General Council one moment's peace. During several months they 
succeeded in carrying their intrigues into every country. They 
went to work with such wild energy that for some time things 
looked bad for the future of the International. Spain, Italy, 
Belgium apparently sided with the Bakounine abstentionists, and 
were against the resolution on the necessity of the International 
taking part in politics.' Here in England the clique of abstention­
ists intrigued with Bradlaugh, Odger and their followers, they did 
not even scruple to make use of the mouchardsd and agents 
provocateurs of Thiers and Badinguet.e  Their organs, the Qui 
Vive! in London, and the Révolution Sociale in Geneva, outdid 
each other in calumniating 'ces autoritaires', ces 'dictateurs', ces 
'Bismarckiens' du Conseil Général Mr Bradlaugh has resorted to the 
most miserable misrepresentation to calumniate  ' le grand chef de ce 
conseil'. i2A For weeks he secretly insinuated at private assemblies, at 
length he has openly proclaimed at a public meeting that Karl 
Marx was and is, a Bonapartist. His assertions are based upon the 
passage in the Civil War in which it is shown that the Empire 'was 
the only form of government possible'—here Bradlaugh stops omitting 
the concluding words 'at a time when the bourgeoisie had already 
lost, and the working class had not yet acquired, the faculty of 
ruling the nation'. 
However the success of these intrigants was only apparent, in 
reality they have everywhere been unsuccessful. All their deep laid 
plots and maneuvres have availed them nothing.

General Council, has passed a resolution to the effect that the 
separatist factions cannot henceforth be considered to form parts 
of the International, their acts having clearly shown that their 
object is to disorganise the Association. That these sections, who 
under another name, are only a fraction of the old Alliance 
faction, by continuing to sow dissension, are opposed to the 
interests of the federation.398  This resolution was voted unani­
mously in an assembly of 500 members. The Bakounists who had 
come all the way from Neufchâtel to be present would have been 
seriously ill-used, had it not been for the men whom they style 
'des Bismarckiens' , 'des autoritaires' —Outine, Perret etc. who rescued 
them and begged the assembly to allow them to speak. (Outine of 
course was well aware that the best means of killing them 
altogether was to allow them to make their speeches.) 
From Belgium, the news according to De Paepe is equally good. 
On Sunday, a congress is to be held at Brussels. 404 
The Spanish Federal Council has likewise adopted all the 
resolutions of the delegates of the Conference, and has exposed 
the bad faith of the separatist faction. 
In America the latter party, represented by Section  12,332  is 
powerless. All they can do is to disturb the meetings of the other 
sections. 
The London French branch338  has ceased to exist—Vermersch 
(Le Père Duchêne) has acted as its undertaker. 
I am afraid I have already taken up far too much of your 
time—yet I must add a few words in reply to your letter, my dear 
Doctor. 
Papa's opinion is that in the event of a war between Russia and 
Prussia, Austria will be the scapegoat, and that the wolves will 
make it up by helping each other to a slice of the lamb. 
I was sorry to hear you did not receive the Illustrated 
paper758—firstly, because it is difficult to get hold of copies of it, 
then I am sorry to think you have been fancying all this time that 
I forgot to send you the paper. Believe me, my dear 'Trautchen'a 
und 'Wenzel',b  you were the very first persons it was sent to. I sent 
it you even before Laura had a copy. The portrait has likewise 
appeared in an Italian paper, in The Illustrated London News, c and 
will shortly be published in the Spanish Illustracion. You see it is

etc.—the artist has sacrificed everything that was characteristic. A 
friend of ours says that if he had by chance seen it in a 
shop-window he would have said ' Voilà un bel homme qui  ressemble  à 
M. Marx'.* I will send you another Paris Illustration, so soon as I 
can get a copy from Paris—here in London the paper is not to be 
had. 
As regards Bergeret's book,b I have not sent it. It is not worth 
while reading. With one exception, all the books on the Commune 
that have hitherto appeared, are mere trash. That one exception 
to the general rule, is Lissagaray's workc—which you will receive 
together with this letter. 
To return to the vexed question of the erratic letter that 
travelled all the way to Russia before reaching you, I must remark 
you are mistaken in supposing that I was realy vexed when I made 
a joke about German 'Bildung'.* —Far be it from me, a French 
barbarian, to venture to criticize the cultivated German nation, cette 
grrrrrrande nationl But, as it seems you are determined to take up 
an imaginary gauntlet (imaginary it is, I assure you, for I have 
both of my gloves in my pocket), I must request you not to use 
unfair arms against me. If you will look at the enclosed address, 
you will see that I have never written Hanover with an accent over 
the ô. On the envelope I wrote 'Hannover'—when I write in 
English I only put one n, which is the correct spelling in 
English.—But let us shake hands (how I wish we could really do

grown-up young lady by the time I see her again (this summer I 
trust), 
Believe me, my dear friends, 
Ever affectionately yours, 
Jenny Marx 
December 22... We have just received your letters. I do not know 
how to thank you for all your kindness. You spoil us too much... 
The box has not arrived as yet, in unpacking it we shall follow 
your instructions to the letter.—With regard to your kind 
invitation, my dear Trautchen, accept my best thanks for it. I am 
afraid, however, it will be impossible for me to leave home this 
winter. I am able to make myself of some use here at this 
moment—besides which, I have already been away from home for 
four months this year,28' and that seemed to be an eternity to me. 
I feel as if I had just only come back from that long banishment. 
You must promise to come and see us next year, my dear 
Trautchen! 
By the bye I forgot to give you my opinion as to O'Donovan 
Rossaa—I am sorry to say that I believe there is much truth in the 
reports given of him. He has not answered the letter I wrote 
him—but has not.again attacked the Communists and that is all I 
wanted. 
The Irish in London are entering the ranks of the International. 
Irish Sections are being formed in various parts of the East-End... 
But you will think this tape-worm epistle is never coming to an 
end and perhaps it wouldn't, if my pen didn't positively refuse to 
mark. So with love to all 
Believe me, 
Your sincere friend 
Jenny Marx 
The box has just arrived. I really do not know which of the 
presents most to admire. I shall spare the locket for the very first 
grand occasion and shall at once get a frame for Shakespeare's 
portrait. It is one of the finest I have ever seen. Mohr is very 
much pleased with his book-shelves. Tussy and mama are not at 
home!

[London,] 29 December 1871 
1 Maitland Park Road 
My dear old Library,3 
I suppose you'll be astonished at receiving a letter from me, but 
Papa is so busy that he has ordered his secretary to answer for 
him. Before speaking to you then of anything else I must give you 
his message. Mohr says he has been so busy that he could not 
answer your questions before—and that as regards Biedermann, 
you had only to compare your translation in the Volksstaat of 
resolution No. IX 'Political Action of the Working Class' with what 
he says to see that his was nothing but a police edition of them. 400 
Moreover no second Conference has been held.— 
Now that business is attended to let us return to ourselves. 
No doubt you think that after all these years I have forgotten 
you. I can assure [you] I have done nothing of the kin'd. I 
remember both you and Alice"5 perfectly—at least I remember 
Alice as she was, now of course she must be quite changed. You I 
should know anywhere though I'm sure you'd never recognize me. 
People that saw me only two or three years ago hardly know me 
again. I should so like to see Alice, and you too. We quite 
expected to see you at the Conference, and I was much 
disappointed when you didn't come.326 
I suppose you have heard of Jenny's and my adventures in 
France, about our being arrested, and cross-examined by M. le 
Préfet Kératry and M. le Procureur général Delpech. —Jenny and 
I on returning from Bosost, a small village in Spain (whither we 
had accompanied Laura and her little boy c who went [there] to 
stay a few days with Lafargue who had gone there to prevent 
being arrested), were arrested on the French frontier, and 
conducted by 24 gendarmes right across the Pyrenees from Fos to 
Luchôn, where we were staying. Arrived there we were driven to 
the door of M. de Kératry's house, kept waiting in front of it in an 
open carriage with two gendarmes opposite us for three quarters

of an hour, and then taken to our own house. It was Sunday night 
and everybody out in the street. At our house we found the police 
who had in the morning searched the house from top to bottom, 
and had treated our poor landlady and our servant who were 
alone in the house very badly. Kératry had already cross-examined 
them, and we were informed that he would presently arrive to do 
the same for us. At last he came, for he wouldn't leave the park 
till the band stopped playing. Our room was already full of 
gendarmes, mouchards,* and agents of every description when the 
Préfet Kératry arrived accompanied by Delpech, procureur  général,  a 
juge de paix, b a juge d'instruction? the procureur de la  république," 1 etc. 
I was sent with the Commissaire de Toulouse and a gendarme into 
a side room and Jenny's examination began, it being then about 
10 o'clock. They examined her over two hours but to no use for 
they heard nothing from her. Then came my turn. Kératry told 
me most shameful lies. He got one or two answers from me by 
pointing to Jenny's declaration, and telling me she had said such 
and such a thing. Fearing to contradict her I said: 'Yes, it is so.' It 
was a dirty trick, wasn't it? However he heard precious little with 
all that. The next day when they came again we refused to take 
the oath. Two days after Keratry came and said he should in the 
evening send orders for our liberation (we were guarded by 
police). Instead of that we were taken off to a 'gendarmerie', and 
there we passed the night. The next day we were, however, let off, 
though we could not really move a step without being watched, 
besides we couldn't get back our English passport. At last we got 
everything, and arrived at last in London. Laura went through 
much the same adventures at Bosost, though not quite so bad as 
we, for she was in Spain. It appears that Kératry after the first 
evening did everything he could to get us free but Thiers wished 
us to be imprisoned. What was very amusing were the blunders 
Kératry and the police made—for instance they looked in the 
mattresses for bombs, and thought that the lamp in which we had 
warmed the milk for the poor little baby who died,' was full of 
'pétrole'l And all that because Lafargue is Mohr's son-in-law, for 
Lafargue had done nothing at all. 
There are a great many members of the Commune here, and 
the poor refugees suffer frightfully—they have none of them any 
money, and you can't think how difficult it is for them to get 
work. I wish they'd taken some of the millions they're accused of 
having stolen.

My dear Doctor, 
I am afraid your plan with regard to the refugees cannot be 
carried out. On the slightest pretext they would be delivered up 
into the hands of the Versailles hangmen. Why, even here in 
England the ministry have been working underhand to introduce 
a bill for their extradition. If it does not come to that it is simply 
owing to the fact, that so soon as the intention of the Government 
had been discovered, it was at once made known to the English 
people, who now being forewarned will be forearmed, and will not 
stand tamely by to see their country degraded by such an act. I do 
not know whether I have told you that it was Papa who first 
obtained information of the plans of the Government by means of 
an acquaintance of his connected with the Home Ministry,3 and 
that he at once made them known in the General Council, after 
which the news was published in The Eastern Post761 And yet, with 
such proofs of the absolute necessity for the political and

diplomatic action of the General Council staring them in the face, 
the miserable band of intrigants, who style themselves Internation­
als, continue to work as indefatigably as ever to undermine the 
Council. In the Belgian Congress404  you will have seen that they 
have already reaped the first fruits of their intrigues. They have 
passed a resolution, the object of which is to transform the 
General Council into a bureau de renseignement? De Paepe, who had 
written to the Council some time before the Belgian Congress, and 
with the contents of whose letter I acquainted you, had been 
altogether mistaken in his appreciation of the state of affairs! 
In London, Bradlaugh is doing all the dirty work, together with 
his understrapper Le Lubez. They do not shrink from employing 
the vilest means to obtain their ends. Mr Bradlaugh's latest 
expedient consisted in spreading the report that Karl Marx is a 
police agent. But instead of entering into the details of that affair, 
I will send you the numbers of The Eastern Post, containing the 
correspondence on that subject. 424 
Papa has already sent off more than half his bookb  to 
Meissner. 396 In the first chapter he has made great alterations, and 
what is more important, he himself is satisfied (which does not 
happen often) with these alterations. The work he has done these 
last few weeks is immense, and it is really a wonder that his health 
(it continues to be good) has not given way under it. 
Entre nous, my dear friend, I must say that I think Meissner has 
been behaving very badly to Papa—that instead of forcing him to 
do all this work at the last moment, he ought to have informed 
him of the forthcoming publication of a second edition at least 
four months ago and thus have given him time. 
Unfortunately Papa is obliged at this moment likewise to 
prepare the first chapter for the French translator436 who is at 
once to set to work, Lafargue having come across a first-rate 
French publisher,0  who is very anxious to publish Das Kapital. The 
translator is not Keller, who was prevented from resuming his 
translation, because he is engaged on another work. Charles 
Longuet, one of the ex-members of the Commune, has found 
another translator for it— Leroy I believe his name is d—who has 
translated several works of Feuerbach e with much skill. He is said 
to have succeeded in rendering in the fixed formal French 
language much of the movement of German thought—no easy 
task. The book is to come out in livraisons 1—thirty I believe.

him.—He has so very little time that I am convinced you will for 
once not mind his not writing himself.—He says I am to tell you

second edition of Papa's book" is about to appear in Germany, 
and this has given him much to do, for many changes have been 
made. A French edition436 is also about to appear, and you can 
understand what work it is to prepare for all this.— He is up the 
greater part of the night writing, and all day he does not leave his 
room—I am much afraid that this will compromise his health.—It 
is to be hoped that he will soon have finished with these difficult 
editions. As to Roberti, Papa says I am to tell you that he has 
seen the essay in the Revue Positive, but never received the 
book.762—Thus it would be impossible for him to write anything in 
refutation of the said book—and the essay does not give sufficient 
matter for attack.—Papa thinks you would do well to retard the 
Russian edition in no way, but to continue as quickly as 
possible.860 —I am in great hopes that when once a French edition 
of Das Kapital has appeared, an English one will soon follow 763— 
the English ape everything the French do, only when a thing 
comes from Paris does it meet with success here.—For instance, 
the biography and portrait which appeared of Papa in the 
Illustration have been copied by no end of papers—not only 
here but in Spain, Italy, Germany, America, etc.—doubtless you 
also have seen it in Russia. 
We are all beginning to feel very anxious about our 'mutual 
friend'.b—The interest we all take in him makes us fear 
greatly.740—Alas that he should ever have left England! — It is 
several months since we heard anything, and the last news was not 
reassuring.—

accept his best compliments,

Sir, 
I have just learnt that your paper has not only published 
repeated attacks on the International Working Men's Association, 
but that it has also (in Nos. 1 & 4 of this year a) translated and 
endorsed the filthy slanders of the police about the London 
General Council and Marx in particular, which appeared in the 
Berlin Neuer Social-Demokrat. b 
Since the publication of my previous letter to you, in the Libero 
Pensiero No. 3, c was suited and perhaps designed to give the 
impression that I approve of this conduct, I hereby formally 
request you to inform your readers that I must repudiate any 
connection with men who aid and abet the European police in 
their persecution of the International and thus—whether con­
sciously or unconsciously—play into the hands of Messrs Bismarck 
and Bonaparte. 
I may tell you furthermore that the regional congress in 
Chemnitz, to which I referred in the letter published by you, has 
unanimously come out in favour of the London General Coun­
cil.418  In conclusion I would add that a copy of this letter is being 
sent to my friend and teacher, Karl Marx, for him to make 
whatever use of it he wishes.

TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 76° 
IN HANOVER 
London, 3 May 1872 
My dear friend, 
Knowing how deep an interest you take in everything that 
concerns Papa, I hasten to tell you that he has just received the 
first proof-sheets of the livraisons* to be published in French. 436 
Unfortunately much time has been lost because M. Lachâtre, the 
publisher, insisted upon printing in the first livraison a portrait of 
the author of Das Kapital. Perhaps we ought to excuse Lachâtre 
for attaching so much importance to the publication of the 
portrait if we take into consideration the fact that the Russian 
government has allowed Das Kapital to be printed, but has put its 
veto upon the issue of the author's likeness! 146 However that may 
be, the fact is that it is owing to the likeness which had to be first 
taken, then engraved, that a great delay has been occasioned. 
The translation of the first part of the book is not so good as we 
had every reason to hope it would be from the fame of the 
translator, M. Roy, who has with great success translated Feuer-
bach. Papa is obliged to make numberless corrections, he has to 
re-write not only whole sentences but entire pages. This labour, 
added to the correcting of the proof-sheets11 from Germany396  and 
to the overwhelming International business is too much even for 
Papa, though you know his Arbeitskraft 0 is extraordinary. I hope 
therefore you will pardon him for not writing oftener to you. It is 
absolutely impossible for him to do so. I greatly fear he will soon 
fall ill again—as so much work will be unendurable when the hot 
weather sets in. At the present moment his health is not bad. 
I suppose you have seen from the German papers that the 
International has been fiercely attacked in the House of Com­
mons? Enclosed is the answer issued by the General Council0 and 
which (with the exception of The Eastern Post) not one London 
paper has had the common fairness to insert.765

Though the British Government has been obliged to declare its 
inability to comply with the wishes of M. Thiers openly to 
interfere with the International, it secretly does all the dirty work 
demanded of it. Mr Gladstone furnishes M. Thiers with the 
correspondence of the General Council to the Continent. Last 
week, for instance, Outine from Geneva wrote to inform us that a 
letter Papa had written to him on International affairs 17 had 
evidently been opened, and that, strange to say, at the post-office 
in London the words via Ostende had been changed for via Calais, 
which of course enabled the Versaillists to make themselves 
acquainted with the contents of the letter. And this letter had been 
registered! 
We have had very sad news from Spain. Our poor little 
Schnaps 3 is very very ill. He has never recovered from the terrible 
attack of cholera he had last August. He is getting weaker and 
weaker.

indignation and which I might not be calm and dispassionate 
enough to recount to you  myself.  For my part, I am happy to seize 
the opportunity to thank you for the confidence you have so 
genuinely retained in your old and undoubtedly sorely tried 
friend, and to tell you of the intense sympathy and concern with 
which I have thought of you and your dear wifea in these difficult, 
troubled times. I have often longed to tell you how much I 
admired the fortitude, tact and skill which you have displayed in 
these trying circumstances. And to be quite frank, my thoughts 
have lingered even more with your wife than with you. In all these 
struggles we women have the harder part to bear, because it is the 
lesser one. A man draws strength from his struggle with the world 
outside, and is invigorated by the sight of the enemy, be their 
number legion. We remain sitting at home, darning socks. That 
does nothing to dispel our fears and the gnawing day-to-day petty 
worries slowly but surely sap our spirit. I can say this from over 30 
years'  experience, and can certainly claim that I am not one to lose 
heart easily. Now I have grown too old to hope for much and the 
recent terrible eventsb have completely shattered my peace of 
mind. I fear that we ourselves, we old ones will not live to 
experience much good any more and my only hope is that our 
children will have an easier time of it. You cannot imagine what 
we have had to endure here in London since the fall of the 
Commune. All the nameless misery, the suffering without end! 
And on top of that, the almost unbearable work on behalf of the 
International. As long as Moor had all the work and just 
managed, thanks to his diplomacy and tactical skill, to keep the 
various unruly elements together in the face of the world and the 
cohorts of enemies, as long as he succeeded in sparing the 
Association RIDICULE, inspired the trembling crew with fear and 
terror, attended no Congress and never claimed the limelight, had 
all the labour and none of the credit—as long as that was the case, 
the rabble remained silent. But now that his enemies have dragged 
him into the light of day, have put his name in the forefront of 
attention, the whole pack have joined forces, and police and 
democrats alike all bay the same refrain about his 'despotic nature, 
his craving for authority and his ambition'! How much better it 
would have been, and how much happier he would be, if he had 
just gone on working quietly and developed the theory of struggle 
for those in the fight. But he has no peace by day or by night.

And what deprivation, what gêne 3 in our private lives! And at the 
very time when our girls need our help. 
So you have heard of Jenny's engagement. Longuet is a very 
gifted man and he is good, honest and decent, and the harmony 
of opinions and convictions between the young couple is certainly a 
guarantee of their future happiness. On the other hand, I cannot 
contemplate their union without great uneasiness and would really 
have preferred it if Jenny's choice had fallen (FOR  A CHANGE) on an 
Englishman or a German, instead of a Frenchman, who of course 
possesses all the charming qualities of his nation, but is not free of 
their foibles and inadequacies. At present, he is tutoring in 
Oxford, in the hope of making better contacts. But you know 
yourself how precarious private tutoring can be, and I cannot help 
being afraid that, as a political woman, Jenny will be exposed to all 
the anxieties and torments inseparable from it. All of this entre 
nous. I know that you will keep it to  yourself.  It was an 
immeasurable relief to be able to open my heart to an old loyal 
friend and reveal my silent worries. I feel easier after these words 
and hope that you will not be angry with me for 'striking such a 
sad note' instead of writing cheerful letters to you and your dear 
wife.  We heard from Laura yesterday. Her little boy, b who is now 3'/2 
years old and the only survivor of her three children, had been ly­
ing sick with cholera for 9 months and was so emaciated 
that his poor parents had given him up for lost. Laura, in a 
strange land,c whose language she did not know, had spent the 
whole 9 months at his bedside! I need say no more. The child is 
now somewhat better and if he recovers still further and is able to 
travel, the Lafargues intend to come here in August. Tussy is well 
and in good cheer and a politician FROM TOP TO BOTTOM! Lenchend  is

My dear friends, 
If you knew how often I have sat down to write to you, and how 
often I have been interrupted before I had written half a dozen 
lines,  I am sure you would forgive me for not having answered 
your last letter before this. 
You, my dear Doctor, will be glad to hear that Mohr is entirely 
of your opinion with regard to his activity in the International. He 
is convinced that so long as he remains in the General Council, it 
will be impossible for him to write the second volume of Das 
Kapital, at which he has been unable to work during the last year. 
Consequently, he has made up his mind to give up his post as 
secretary immediately after the next Congress. Until that time 
however, he will have to work terribly hard in the Council and out 
of it, in order to prepare for the great battle that will be fought 
out at the Congress, which is to take place in Holland. 580 
You will have some idea of this work when I tell you that 
besides writing manifestoes, reading or answering mountains of 
letters, Mohr is obliged to attend not only the usual weekly sittings 
at Rathbone Place, but additional ones at our house and that of 
Engels, 767 the last of which lasted from four in the afternoon until 
one o'clock in the morning. So much for International business. 
The remaining time (and there is not much of it) is given up to 
the correction of the proof-sheets a from Meissner, and the 
revision of the French translation, 436 which unfortunately is so very 
imperfect, that Mohr has been obliged to re-write the greater part 
of the first chapter. The first livraison^ consisting only of the 
portrait of the author, after the enclosed photograph by Mayall— 
an autograph letter 1 and answer from the publisher Lachâtre, 
will shortly appear, in about a week.—Of the Russian transla­
tion, which is excellent, a thousand copies have already been 
a of the second German edition of Volume I of  Capital  - b instalment - c See this 
volume, p. 347.

The French translation of the Civil War is producing a very 
good effect upon the refugees, equally satisfying all parties— 
Blanquists, Proudhoniens, and Communists. It is a great pity it did 
not appear earlier,245 as it would undoubtedly have done much 
towards smoothing down the animosity against the General 
Council.— 
And now, my dearest Trautchen,a  let me also give you some 
news.  In all probability the marriage so often announced by the 
presse policière de Paris will take place somewhere about the middle 
of July—the 18th or 19th. Last week the Gaulois married me for 
the 20th time. It selected the notorious Landeck as my husband. b 
When I am married in good earnest I suppose those idiotic 
scribblers will let me alone. 
I cannot send you M. Longuet's photograph, my dear friends, 
as I only have a very horrible one, that is being exposed in the 
shop windows, a caricature made to please the bourgeoisie, and to 
satisfy them that physically as well as morally the Communeux are 
the monsters for which they took them. So soon as I have a better 
likeness I will send it [to] you. What do you think of the enclosed 
one of Papa? We all greatly admire it and think it superior to the 
one he had taken at Hanover.— 
With best love from all at home to yourselves and Käuzchen c 
Believe me as ever 
your affectionate friend

will have seen from the above address I am again in my dear old 
home with my parents. My husband and I have left Oxford after a 
fruitless stay of six weeks, during which time not a single pupil 
was forthcoming. The learned Dundrearies who had taken lessons 
during the summer term were no doubt so much shocked at 
seeing Mr Longuet's name among the names of the delegates to 
the International Congress M0 that they resolved to have nothing to 
do with their former teacher. Of course this was a great 
disappointment to me at first, knowing how difficult it is to find 
employment where there is so much competition—this country is 
overflowing with all sorts of French professors, French exiled 
journalists, doctors, lawyers, tinkers and tailors having indiscrimi­
nately taken to that line. Gradually I have however become 
reconciled to our Oxford misadventures. I am so very much 
happier in London than in orthodox snubbish Oxford. London 
contains Modena Villas and in the front room first floor of 
Modena Villas I can always find my dear Mohr. I cannot express 
you how lonely I feel when separated from him—and he tells me 
that he also missed me very much, and that during my absence he 
buried himself altogether in his den. If only my husband and I 
could find something to do in London, I shall bless the ill luck 
that has driven us from the grand seat of sham science. 
The Lafargues are also staying at Hampstead, where they intend 
settling down for a few years. Mama wishes me to tell you that 
Laura is looking much better now than while staying at the 
Hague—she is much more cheerful, and we trust, will gradually 
altogether recover from the terrible shock caused by the death of 
her dear little boy.a All the other members of our family are well. 
I trust, my dear friends, you will be able to give me equally good 
news of yourselves. Do write me soon. You know I take a deep 
interest in all that concerns you. If you, my dear Trautchen, 
would only condescend to let me have one letter for every half 
dozen you write your friend Mrs Tenge I should be satisfied. You 
see I am not very exacting and not at all jealous! 
The French translation of Das Kapital is slowly progressing. 436 
The next livraison 11 will be excellent. Papa has re-written it 
altogether. The translator, who is a very dull dog, had made a sad 
mess of it. Unfortunately this sort of correction gives Mohr as 
much, if not more work, than if he had written the whole thing 
himself.  He works every night till two or three o'clock in the 
morning. Have you read the articles on the first livraison that have

just appeared in the Liberté of Brussels? 3 It was left for these 
Belgian wiseacres to discover that Marx and Proudhon have 
together resolved the 'constitution de la valeur'. Voilà ce que c'est que 
l'esprit belge —du faro tout pur, b unadulterated. However dull these 
Belgians be, they are not too dull to carry on their miserable 
intrigues against the International. They work as hard as ever with 
their brothers of the Jura and have of late also joined hands with 
the model British workmen Hales and the drunken Mottershead. 
Their party has been further strengthened by the addition of 
Jung—whose shameful defection is the result of his grotesque 
vanity. The miserable wretch could not bear the idea of 
transferring the Council to New York, which robs him of all his 
importance. For weeks he fumed and fretted in silence, and now 
at length has openly entered the service of the Great Hales. All 
these petty intriguers however will soon have played out their 
small games, and certainly it will be a good thing for the 
Association to have got rid of such workers as the illustrious Jung, 
Hales etc. It is after all no misfortune these men have come out in 
their true colours.— 
My paper is full—so I have just only time to repeat to you our 
best wishes for yourselves and dear Fränzchen. 0

know me well enough to have attributed my silence to everything 
but want of friendship. And indeed everything but that has been 
the cause of it. Ever since Christmas I have been altogether 
absorbed by the delightful battle known as the struggle for life. 
Were I to enumerate all the races I have run from the north to 
the south, from the east to the west of London—and run in 
vain—to pick up pupils for French, German, singing and 
elocution, I should sadly tire you. The result of all this has been 
the acquisition of a vast amount of experience, a thorough insight 
into the shameless impossible tricks of advertisers, agents, princi­
pals of schools etc. Though like Shakespeare's Rosalind I would 
rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me 
sada—yet in this case I do not regret my hard earned experi­
ence—for I hope some day to make known to the public the 
machinations of these ghouls of middlemen and thus to save 
others from the snares into which I have fallen. My husbandb has 
not been more successful than myself in this land of liberty and 
free competition. Of course if we had chosen to settle down 
somewhere in the provinces, to vegetate in some corner out of the 
world, we might have found employment long ago—but though 
married, my heart is as it ever was chained to the spot where my 
Papa is, and elsewhere life would not be life to me. If all fails 
however I suppose I must leave him... But sufficient for the day is 
the evil thereof0—I will not think of it beforehand. 
I have yet to thank you for your last letters, my dear friends. To 
you, my dear Doctor, I need not write a line in answer to your 
opinion of the representatives of the Jura at the Congress.580  Time 
has taken the trouble to do that for me, and to do' it far more 
effectually than I could have done. Those miserable intriguers 
whose sole object is to sow dissension in the Association and to 
reap the benefit  thereof,  have been all along treated far too 
generously by their opponents.—Have you seen the last produc­
tion of that infamous lump of vanity, Jung, in the Liberté d? The 
lies he tells of my husband he has concocted together with a 
quondam revolutionist who has now settled down as flunkey in an 
English gentleman's family, and is content to figure as 'calves'. A 
companion worthy of the illustrious Jung!

of Papa's going to America.—

NOTES 
1 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx and 
Friedrich Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary and 
Notes,  Martin Lawrence Ltd., London [1934].—3, 30, 38, 61, 127 
2 This refers to the letter which Ludwig Kugelmann wrote to Marx on the eve of 
France declaring war on Prussia (18 July 1870). He expressed his conviction 
that any further aggravation of Franco-Prussian relations would lead to war and 
criticised the proclamation adopted at a meeting of Brunswick workers held on 
16 July 1870. He considered it to be a mistake to demand categorically of the 
French workers that they overthrow the Empire in order to avert war. The 
meeting was called by the leaders of the German Social-Democratic Workers' 
Party (the Eisenachers) in protest against war preparations by the ruling classes 
and to express solidarity with the manifesto issued by the Paris members of the 
International (see Le Réveil, 12 July 1870). Despite certain shortcomings the 
proclamation as a whole was internationalist in spirit. It is quoted by Marx in 
the 'First Address of the General Council of the International Working Men's 
Association on the Franco-Prussian War' (see present edition, Vol. 22).—3 
3 This refers to the Franco-Prussian War of  1870-71.—  3 
4 The issue of Le Réveil with the article in question has not been found.—3 
5 In July and August 1870, the town of Blois was the scene of a major political 
trial. Seventy-two people, among them such prominent Blanquists as Charles 
Victor Jaclard, Edme Marie Gustave Tridon, Gustave Paul Flourens, Théophile 
Charles Gilles Ferré, as well as Félix Pyat, were charged with conspiring to 
assassinate Napoleon III and stage a coup d'état. The Supreme Court sentenced 
most of the accused to penal servitude and to terms varying from 5 to 20 years 
in prison and exile.— 3 
6 The Fenians were Irish revolutionaries who named themselves after the 
'Féne' —the name of the ancient inhabitants of Ireland. Their first organisa­
tions appeared in the 1850s in the USA among the Irish immigrants and later 
in Ireland  itself.  The secret Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, as the organisa­
tion was known in the early 1860s, aimed at establishing an independent Irish 
republic by means of an armed uprising. The Fenians, who expressed the 

=====第626页=====
592 Notes 
interests of the Irish peasantry, came chiefly from the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and intelligentsia and believed in conspiratorial tactics. The British Government 
attempted to suppress the Fenian movement with drastic police action.—3 
7 A reference to the psychological law formulated, in the mid-19th century, by Ernst 
Weber and Gustav Fechner. It establishes the correlation between the intensity of a 
sensation and the intensity of the stimuli that cause it.—4 
8 Marx is alluding to Léo Frankel's article 'Ein belauschtes Zwiegespräch' in the 
Volkswille, No. 10, 2 April 1870, in which Frankel evolved a 'formula' that, he 
thought, explained the essence of value. See also Marx's letter to Engels of 
14 April 1870 (present edition, Vol. 43).—4 
9 At a congress of the Romance Federation held in La Chaux-de-Fonds between 
4 and 6 April 1870, there occurred a split between the Bakuninists and the 
General Council supporters. The Bakuninist delegates, having usurped the 
name of the Romance Congress, elected their own Federal Committee and 
transferred its seat to La Chaux-de-Fonds. The General Council supporters 
continued their work under the leadership of the Romance Federal Committee 
residing in Geneva. On 28 June the General Council passed a resolution, 
submitted by Marx, which recognised the Geneva Committee as the Federal 
Committee of Romance Switzerland (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 136); the 
resolution was sent to both Federal Committees by Jung and published in La 
Solidarité, No. 16, on 23 July 1870, and in Le Mirabeau, No. 53, on 24 July 
1870.—5,  26, 179, 285, 316 
10 The International Alliance of Socialist Democracy (L'Alliance internationale de la 
démocratie socialiste) —an international anarchist organisation founded by 
Mikhail Bakunin and his followers in Geneva in October 1868. The programme 
of the Alliance called for the immediate abolition of all states, the equalisation 
of classes, and the abolition of the right of inheritance. The leaders of the Al­
liance sought admission to the International as an autonomous international 
organisation within the International Working Men's Association. Their claims 
were rejected by the General Council (see the resolution written by Marx and 
approved by the General Council on 22 December 1868: 'The International 
Working Men's Association and the International Alliance of Socialist Democra­
cy', present edition, Vol. 21); and only after the leaders of the Alliance had 
expressed their readiness to dissolve it were its sections admitted to the 
International, on the common terms, in 1869. Having publicly declared the 
dissolution of the Alliance, the Bakuninist leaders actually preserved it as a 
secret, conspiratorial organisation and sought to use it to boost their influence 
in the International as a counter to the General Council. 
The struggle of the revolutionary proletarian wing of the International 
against the Bakuninist sectarians gained momentum after the Paris Commune, 
and became especially sharp after the London Conference of 1871. By a 
decision of the Hague Congress of the International (1872), at which the 
existence of the secret Bakuninist Alliance and its divisive activities were 
exposed, its chief leaders, Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume, were expelled 
from the International Working Men's Association.—5, 26, 163, 181, 233, 255,

struggle against Napoleonic rule. In the 1870s, it consisted of men under forty 
years of age who had seen active service and had been in the first-line reserve.

Notes 593 
During the Franco-Prussian War of  1870-71,  the Landwehr was used in military 
actions on a par with the regular troops.—  7, 12, 20, 117 
12 Between the end of July 1870 and February 1871, Engels wrote a series of 59 
articles published in The Pall Mall Gazette under the title Notes on the War (see 
present edition, Vol. 22). In these articles, written in the form of military 
surveys, Engels analysed the events of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 
from the angle of historical materialism. With the exception of the first three 
articles, signed 'Z', they were published unsigned.— 7, 17, 22, 35, 56, 58, 62 
13 In 1866 The Manchester Guardian published five articles by Engels on the 
Austro-Prussian war under the title Notes on the War in Germany (see present 
edition, Vol. 20).—7 
14 The reference is to the report on a meeting organised by members of the 
German colony in Manchester at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. One 
of the aims of the meeting was to set up a relief fund for the wounded and the 
families of the war dead. The report was published in The Manchester Guardian, 
No. 7466, on 22 July 1870 under the heading 'Meeting of Germans in 
Manchester'.— 8 
15 In his letter of 18 July 1870, Eugen Oswald, a German refugee, asked Marx to 
sign an Address on the Franco-Prussian War drawn up by a group of French 
and German democratic refugees. The Address was published as a leaflet on 
31 July 1870; the editions that followed were signed by Marx, Engels, 
Liebknecht, Bebel and other members of the International. Marx and his 
associates agreed to sign it on conditions outlined by Marx in his letter to 
Oswald of 3 August 1870 (see this volume, p. 34). 
Oswald enclosed with his letter an excerpt from Louis Blanc's letter in which he 
called for the Address on the Franco-Prussian War to be signed by as many people 
as possible.—9, 11, 31, 35, 36, 37, 64 
16 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Marx and 
Engels, Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 
1955.—10, 24, 195 
17 This letter by Marx has not been found.—10, 15, 26, 33, 65, 70, 106, 176, 192,

19 'Lord,  in Thee is all my trust'  ('Jesus  meine Zuversicht') —a song by Christoph 
Runge, a German poet and publisher, dedicated to Luise Henriette von 
Brandenburg, the wife of the Elector. It was first published in Runge's 
Geistliche Lieder und Psalmen, which appeared in Berlin in 1650.—10, 13 
20 The draft of a secret treaty between France and Prussia, drawn up in 1866, was 
published in the German press after 20 July 1870. On 25 July it was published 
in The Times. The draft treaty envisaged the annexation of Belgium and 
Luxembourg by France in return for which France undertook to observe 
neutrality in Prussia's war against Austria in 1866. By publishing the draft 
Bismarck sought to turn public opinion in England and Belgium against 
France.—11,  19

594 Notes 
21 On 23 January 1860 Britain and France signed a commercial treaty under 
which France renounced its excessively high protective tariffs. Article 2 of the 
treaty contained a special proviso which obliged France to lower the duties on 
imported British coal to 15 centimes per 100 kg. France in return was granted the 
right to export most of her goods to Britain duty-free.—11, 19 
22 In the German original the term Haupt- und Staatsaktionen (principal and 
spectacular actions) is used; this has several meanings. In the 17th and the first 
half of the 18th century it denoted plays performed by German touring 
companies. The term can also denote major political events.— 11 
23 This refers to the letter of 24 July 1870 written by the members of the 
Committee of the Russian Section of the International and signed by Nikolai 
Utin, Victor Bartenev and Anton Trusov. They wrote about the Section's 
struggle against Mikhail Bakunin and his attacks on members of the Russian 
Section as well as the Romance Federation. The authors also referred to their 
intention to publish a pamphlet against Bakunin (their plan was not carried 
out).  The Committee members warned the General Council that Sergei 
Nechayev and Vladimir Serebrennikov had left for London and that the latter 
had obtained a recommendation to Dupont. Marx replied to their letter in his 
letter to Johann Philipp Becker of 2 August 1870 (see this volume, 
pp. 26-27).—11,  19, 22, 26 
24 Marx means renting a house for Engels who intended to move from 
Manchester to London for good in September 1870 after retiring from the firm 
of Ermen & Engels. Jenny Marx took an active part in looking for a suitable 
house.—12, 15, 19, 49, 52, 555, 558, 559 
25 This letter was written in English. It was first published in full (in English) in 
Annali Milan, 1958, an. 1.—12 
26 Mitrailleuse—a multi-barrelled, rapid-fire gun mounted on a heavy carriage. The 
mitrailleuse used in the French army in 1870-71 had 25 barrels that fired in 
succession by means of a special mechanism. It could fire up to 175 shots a 
minute with carbine cartridges. However, the experience of the Franco-Prussian 
War showed the mitrailleuse to be unsuited to battlefield conditions due to 
construction inadequacies.—12, 35 
27 On this see also Engels' 'Notes on the War.—I' in The Pall Mall  Gazette,  No. 1703, 
29 July 1870 (present edition, Vol. 22).—13 
28 Marx sent to Paul and Laura Lafargue a clipping from Der Volksstaat, No. 59, 
23 July 1870, with a report from Berlin which quoted the declaration made by 
Bebel and Liebknecht in the Reichstag on 21 July 1870. He may also have 
enclosed the 'Politische Uebersicht' column from the same issue, dealing with 
the attitude of the German working class to the Franco-Prussian War. On 
Bebel's and Liebknecht's declaration in the Reichstag see Note 31.—14 
29 Paul and Laura Lafargue lived in a suburb of Paris known as Levallois-Perret, 
on place de la Reine-Hortense, in the immediate vicinity of military 
fortifications.—14, 35 
30 The 'First Address of the General Council of the International Working Men's 
Association on the Franco-Prussian War' (see present edition, Vol. 22) was 
published in Der Volksstaat, No. 63, 7 August 1870, under the heading 'Manifest 
des Generalraths der Internationalen Arbeiterassoziation', with the note to which 
Marx is referring in his letter.— 16

Notes 595 
31 On 21 July 1870, during the vote on war credits in the North German 
Reichstag, Bebel and Liebknecht abstained, declaring that to vote for credits 
would signify giving a vote of confidence in the Prussian Government, which 
was waging a dynastic war; to vote against the credits, on the other hand, might 
be regarded as an approval of Bonaparte's treacherous policy. On 26 July 1870, 
Marx read their declaration in the General Council of the International.which 
unreservedly approved their action. The declaration was translated into English 
by Marx and published in The Bee-Hive Newspaper on 6 August 1870 in the 
report on the General Council meeting.—16, 51 
32 Engels' forecast proved correct. On 6 August 1870 one of the major battles of 
the early period of the war took place at Forbach (in Lorraine, not far from 
Saarbrücken), in which the Prussian troops defeated the French 2nd Corps 
under General Frossard. In historical literature this battle is also called the 
Battle of Spicheren. Engels refers to it as such in several of his letters.—18, 
35, 54 
33 Engels attached these calculations to his article 'Notes on the War.—III', which 
he enclosed with his letter to Marx. As from 31 July Engels forwarded his 
articles directly to The Pall Mall Gazette.—20 
34 The Zouaves (after the name of an Algerian tribe)—a type of French light 
infantry first formed in 1830 as colonial troops in Algeria. Three Zouave 
regiments of the MacMahon Corps took part in the war of 1870-71.—21 
35 The Turcos or Algerian riflemen—French light infantry formed in the early 
1840s from native inhabitants of Algeria (the officers and some of the NCOs 
were French).—21 
36 The Garde mobile (Mobile National Guard)—special armed forces introduced 
in France in 1848. From 1868 onwards it was made up of men who had 
reached call-up age but were not enlisted for active service or in the reserve; it 
was assigned to frontier defence, and to rear and garrison service. In 1870 it was 
called up for active service for the first time and formed the core of the French 
armed forces after the fall of the Empire. The Garde mobile was abolished in 
1872.—21

38 The agenda for the next Congress of the International, to be opened in Mainz 
on 5 September 1870, was drawn up by Marx and approved by the 
General Council on 12 July 1870 (see present edition, Vol. 21). The text 
adopted by the Council was issued in English as a leaflet entitled The Fifth 
Annual Congress of the International Working Men's Association and appeared in a 
number of English, French and German papers. 
On 14 July 1870 Marx sent to Hermann Jung the French text of the agenda 
for translation into German (see present edition, Vol. 43, pp. 537-38). The 
corrected German translation was published in Der Volksstaat, No. 65, on 
13 August 1870.—25 
39 Marx is referring to an attempt by the Bakuninists to gain a false majority at 
the Congress of the Romance Federation held in La Chaux-de-Fonds between 4 
and 6 April 1870 (see Note 9), by sending delegates from minor and often 
non-existent sections, with a view to usurping the leadership of the Romance 
Federation of the International.—25 
40 On 17 May 1870 the General Council decided to convene the Fifth Congress of

the International in Mainz. On 2 August 1870 the General Council resolved to 
defer the Congress owing to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War and ask 
the sections of the International for approval of its decision. The Committee of 
the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party, the German sections in 
Switzerland, and the Belgian and Romance Federations of the International 
supported the General Council's proposal. On 23 August 1870 the Council 
officially decided to defer the Congress.—25, 33 
41 The Pan-Slavic Congress met in Prague on 2 June 1848. It was attended by 
representatives of the Slavic countries forming part of the Habsburg Empire. 
The Right, liberal moderate wing, sought to solve the national problem through 
autonomy of the Slavic countries within the framework of the Habsburg 
monarchy. The Left, radical wing, wanted to act in alliance with the 
revolutionary-democratic movement in Germany and Hungary. Mikhail Baku-
nin affiliated with the Left. Radical delegates took an active part in the popular 
uprising in Prague (12-17 June 1848), directed against the arbitrary rule of the 
Austrian authorities, and were subjected to cruel reprisals.—26 
42 From 3 to 9 May 1849, Dresden, the capital of Saxony, was the scene of an 
armed uprising caused by the refusal of the Saxon King to recognise the 
Imperial Constitution. The insurgents captured a considerable part of the city, 
the workers being the most active among the barricade fighters. The Russian 
revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin, the German working-class leader Stephan Born, 
and the composer Richard Wagner were active participants in the uprising.—27 
43 Marx is referring to the articles by Sigismund Borkheim, 'Russische Briefe. 
VIII-X. Michael Bakunin, XI. Ein russischer penny-a-liner', which were published 
anonymously in Die Zukunft between July and November 1869. Analysing 
Bakunin's articles which had appeared in Russian, Borkheim criticised the 
author mainly for his Pan-Slavist ideas and the idealisation of the Russian 
peasant commune.—27, 404 
44 In their letter of 24 July 1870 (see Note 23) the members of the Committee of 
the Russian Section asked Marx to pass on their thanks to Borkheim for his 
article against Sergei Nechayev published in Der Volksstaat, and expressed their 
willingness to support him in the polemics. 
The dispute had arisen when Borkheim published his article 'Der Brief 
Njetschajeffs' (Der Volksstaat, No. 22, 16 March 1870). Borkheim warmly 
welcomed the development of the revolutionary movement in Russia, but at the 
same time exposed various false rumours which Nechayev had spread about his 
arrest, exile to Siberia, escape, etc.—27 
45 This letter by Engels has not been found.—29, 43, 125, 156, 159, 185, 277, 305,

46 Bas (Lower) Empire is the name sometimes given to the Byzantine Empire and 
also to the late Roman Empire. In a more general sense, the name is applied to 
any state going through a period of decline and disintegration. Here the 
Second Empire in France is meant.—30, 39, 41 
47 Speaking in the House of Commons on 1 August 1870, Disraeli dwelt upon the 
idea of rapprochement between Britain and Russia. He pointed out that they were 
the only powers to have abided by the provisions of the Vienna Treaty of 1815 
which guaranteed Prussia the right to Saxony. 
Speaking in this connection on the Polish question, Marx had in mind the 
violation of the terms of the Vienna Treaty concerning the Constitution of the

Polish lands. Thus in 1832, following the suppression of the Polish uprising, the 
tsarist government, with the connivance of the Western powers, abrogated the 
Constitution in that part of Poland which was annexed to Russia in 1815 as an 
autonomous region. The same thing happened with regard to the guarantees of 
the autonomous rights of the Cracow Republic,whose territory was seized by 
Austria in 1846 after the suppression of the Cracow insurrection.—33 
48 On 23 July 1870 La Solidarité published the General Council's resolution on 
the Federal Committee of Romance Switzerland (see Note 9) signed by 
Hermann Jung, the Council's Corresponding Secretary for Switzerland. The 
editors of La Solidarité added their comments on the resolution, denying the right 
of the General Council to decide on this issue.—33, 36 
49 The first open clash between the adherents of scientific socialism and the 
Bakuninists over abolishing the right of inheritance came at the Basle Congress 
(September 1869). Since none of the proposals produced an absolute majority 
the Basle Congress did not adopt any resolution on this question.— 33 
50 This refers to the French Branch in London, founded in the autumn of 1865. 
Besides proletarian members (Eugène Dupont, Hermann Jung, Paul Lafargue 
and others), the Branch also included petty-bourgeois refugees (Victor Le 
Lubez and later Félix Pyat). In 1868, after the General Council had adopted a 
resolution proposed by Marx (7 July 1868) condemning Pyat's provocative calls 
for terrorist acts against Napoleon III (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 7), a 
split occurred in the Branch, and its proletarian members resigned. But Pyat's 
group, having lost virtually all ties with the International, continued to call itself 
the French Branch in London. It also repeatedly gave support to anti-
proletarian elements opposing Marx's line in the General Council. On 10 May 
1870 the General Council officially dissociated itself from this group (see 
present edition, Vol. 21, p. 131).—33, 64, 141, 342 
51 Marx wrote this letter on a form from Borkheim' s office bearing its address: 9 
Billiter Square, E.C.—36 
52 The original version of the General Council's resolution, written by Marx on 
22 December 1868, 'The International Working Men's Association and the 
International Alliance of Socialist Democracy', made the point that is was 
necessary to publish this resolution in all countries where sections of the 
International existed. This point was omitted from the final text (see present 
edition, Vol. 21, p. 36).—37 
53 Marx and his family were on vacation in Ramsgate from 9 to 31 August 
1870.—38,  56, 60, 64, 82, 555, 557 
54 Boustrapa—a nickname of Louis Bonaparte, composed of the first syllables of 
the names of cities where he staged putsches: Boulogne (6 August 1840), 
Strasbourg (30 October 1836) and Paris (coup d'état of 2 December 1851, 
which led to the establishment of a Bonapartist dictatorship in France).—38, 51 
55 The North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) —a federative state 
formed in 1867 under the domination of Prussia, after her victory in the 
Austro-Prussian war of 1866. It replaced the defunct German Confederation. 
The North German Confederation included 19 German states and three free 
cities,  which were formally recognised as autonomous. Bavaria, Baden, 
Württemberg and Hesse-Darmstadt joined it in 1870. The establishment of the 
North German Confederation was a major step towards German national unity.

The Confederation ceased to exist in January 1871, when the German 
Empire was formed.—38, 91 
56 The Peace Society—a pacifist organisation founded by the Quakers in London in 
1816.  The Society, which was actively supported by the Free Traders, donated 
£20 for the dissemination of the 'First Address of the General Council of the 
International Working Men's Association on the Franco-Prussian War'. Johann 
Philipp Becker used this money in Switzerland to have 30,000 copies of the 
Address printed in German and French. 
At a meeting of the General Council on 2 August 1870, John Weston, who 
acted as chairman, announced that John Stuart Mill had commended the 
Address.—40, 51, 77, 82, 100, 556 
57 Engels worked on The History of Ireland in the latter months of 1869 and 
during the first half of 1870. However, this work remained unfinished. Engels 
wrote the first chapter ('Natural Conditions') and part of the second chapter 
('Old Ireland'), which are contained in Volume 21 of the present edition; the 
preparatory materials for the book will be found in part in Volume 21 and also 
in: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Ireland and the Irish Question, Progress 
Publishers, Moscow, 1978.—40, 329 
58 The defeats of the French army at Forbach (Spicheren) and Werth led to 
spontaneous anti-government demonstrations in Paris, Lyons, Marseilles and 
other cities on 7-9 August 1870. These revolutionary actions almost coincided 
with the anniversary of the popular insurrection in Paris (10 August 1792) 
which had led to the overthrow of the monarchy in France and the foundation 
of the First Republic. 
On 10 August 1870 The Pall Mall Gazette published a report on the events 
in Paris entitled 'Affairs in Paris. Prospects of Revolution'.—41 
59 Engels alludes to Henri de Rochefort, editor of La Marseillaise, a Left 
Republican paper. From February 1870, he had been serving a six-month term 
in the Sainte-Pelagie prison for an article published in the newspaper on 
12 January 1870, after the assassination of the journalist Victor Noir by Prince 
Pierre Bonaparte. La Marseillaise was suppressed from 18 May to 20 July 1870 
for its articles directed against the ruling circles of the Second Empire, and on 
9 September it ceased publication altogether.—41 
60 The Schiller Institute, founded in Manchester in November 1859 to coincide 
with the celebrations of Schiller's centenary, was conceived as a cultural and 
social centre for the city's German colony. In 1864 Engels became a member of 
its Directorate and later President of the Institute, devoting much time to it and 
exercising considerable influence over its activities. 
In September 1868 while Engels was away from Manchester, the Directorate 
invited Karl Vogt, who had connections with Bonapartist circles, to give a 
lecture at the Institute. This caused Engels to resign his positions (see present 
edition, Vol. 21, p. 18). In April 1870 Engels was again elected a member of 
the Directorate, but he no longer took an active part in its work.—43 
61 A reference to the letters written by the members of the Brunswick Committee 
of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party and to other documents which 
Marx was receiving from Germany in connection with the disagreements that had 
arisen between the Brunswick Committee and the editorial board of Der Volksstaat, 
the central organ of the Party, over the attitude to the Franco-Prussian War and 
the tactics to be pursued by the working class. 

=====第633页=====
Notes 599 
At the beginning of the war the editorial board of Der Volksstaat, taking an 
internationalist position on the whole, rather ignored the task of national 
unification. Some members of the Brunswick Committee, on the other 
hand, underestimated the expansionist tendencies of the Prussian ruling circles, 
which had become obvious even in the initial stages of the war when it was 
largely defensive on the German side. When disagreements sharpened, the 
members of the Committee requested Marx to give his opinion on the subject. 
Marx and Engels elaborated the tactical line of the German proletariat and 
the Social-Democratic Workers' Party and expounded it in their 'Letter to the 
Committee of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party' (see present edition, 
Vol. 22).—43,  45 
62 Marx wrote this letter to Jung after he had received resolutions from the 
Central Committee of the German-speaking sections in Switzerland which 
endorsed the General Council's proposal to defer the regular congress of the 
International due on 5 September 1870. 
A copy, handwritten by Marx, of the resolution of the Committee of the 
Social-Democratic Workers' Party was enclosed with the letter.—44 
63 By a decision of the Vienna Congress of 1815, the northern regions of Savoy 
(Chablais, Faucigny and Geneves), which formed part of the Sardinian 
Kingdom, were declared a neutral zone. After Savoy and Nice had been 
annexed by France in 1859, Switzerland laid claim to these neutral regions.—45

65 Engels is referring to workers employed in the large-scale replanning and 
reconstruction of Paris, a project headed by Georges Eugène Haussmann, the 
Prefect of the Seine Department, in the 1850s and 1860s. The purpose of the 
reconstruction was not only to improve the aristocratic areas and widen streets 
to make it easier for the troops to manoeuvre and the artillery to fire in the 
event of a popular uprising; it was also planned to reinforce Bonapartist 
influence among the section of the proletariat that received temporary 
employment as a result of this project.—46 
66 This refers to the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the formation of the North 
German Confederation (see Note 55).—47, 57 
67 In his letter of 7 August 1870 Kugelmann informed Marx of the national 
enthusiasm that the war had given rise to in Germany.—47 
68 The Confederation of the Rhine (Rheinbund) —an association of the states of 
Western and Southern Germany founded in 1806 under the protectorate of 
Napoleon. Initially it embraced 16 states. Five more joined later. All virtually 
became vassals of Napoleonic France. The Confederation collapsed in 1813 
after the military defeats suffered by Napoleon in Germany.—47 
69 In his letter to Marx of 13 August 1870 Liebknecht quoted the Elberfelder 
Zeitung as saying that Engels was in a state of 'patriotic euphoria'.—48 
70 The chassepot—a breech-loading rifle named after its inventor, was adopted by 
the French army in 1866. It was much superior to Dreyse's needle gun used by 
the Prussian army.—48

71 Engels is referring to the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei) which 
was set up in 1865 and consisted of democratic elements of the petty 
bourgeoisie and partly of the bourgeoisie, chiefly from South German states. As 
distinct from the National Liberals, the German People's Party opposed the 
establishment of Prussian supremacy in Germany and advocated a so-called 
Greater Germany embracing both Prussia and Austria. While pursuing an 
anti-Prussian policy and advancing general democratic slogans, the People's 
Party at the same time voiced the particularist aspirations of some German 
states.—48 
72 Engels wrote this letter in reply to Mrs Marx's letter of 10 August 1870 (see 
this volume, pp. 555-56).—49 
73 The Pall Mall Gazette of 9 August 1870 carried the article 'England's Position' 
which was written in the form of a letter and signed with the pseudonym 'Von 
Thunder-ten-Tronckh' (Thunder-ten-Tronckh is a castle in Westphalia).—50 
74 Engels means the portrait of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, a Fenian leader, 
which Ludwig Kugelmann asked to be sent for a collection of Irish folk songs 
entitled Erins Harfe being prepared for publication by Joseph Risse. At the 
request of Marx's eldest daughter Jenny, Engels wrote short notes for the 
Preface (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 140). However, neither Rossa's portrait 
nor Engels' notes appeared in the collection, which was published in Hanover in 
1870.—50, 54, 557 
75 The letter to the Brunswick Committee of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party 
in reply to a request from the members of the Committee that Marx express his 
viewpoint on the war and the attitude the Party should take to it (see Note 61) 
was prepared jointly by Marx and Engels, during Marx's stay in Manchester 
from 22 to 30 August 1870, and sent to Germany signed by Marx (see present 
edition, Vol. 22).—50 
76 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx and 
Friedrich Engels, Writings on the Paris Commune, Monthly Review Press, New 
York-London, 1971.—52, 76 
77 Engels calls Alsace and Lorraine a ' German-speaking Venetia', by analogy with the 
Italian province of Venetia, which was part of the Habsburg Empire in 1799-1805 
and 1814-1866 and a stronghold of the Italian national liberation movement 
against Austrian oppression.—53 
78 After the Batde of Gravelotte, which took place on 18 August 1870 (in historical 
literature it is also known as the Battle of Saint Privat), the Army of the Rhine 
under Bazaine was surrounded in Metz and surrendered in late October 
1870.—53 
79 This refers to the defeats which the French army suffered at the Battle of 
Colombey-Nouilly (known also as the Batde of Borny) on 14 August 1870, the 
Batde of Vionville-Mars-la-Tour on 16 August, and the Batde of Gravelotte-Saint 
Privat on 18 August.—53

85 Marx wrote this letter in reply to several letters from Sorge, written between 
4 May and 4 August 1870. A correspondence developed, linking Marx, and also 
Engels, with Sorge in close friendship for many years.—56 
86 In his letters Sorge informed Marx that Robert William Hume, the General 
Council's correspondent in the USA, used his powers for self-advertisement. In 
the 'membership cards' of the International, which he issued without the 
knowledge of the General Council, Hume distorted the aims and tasks of the 
International Working Men's Association. 
Marx informed the General Council about Sorge's letter on 6 September 
1870.  Eccarius, the Corresponding Secretary for the United States, was 
instructed to demand from Hume that he abide strictly by the Rules of the 
International Working Men's Association.—57, 60 
87 At the beginning of 1870, Gustave Paul Cluseret was empowered by the 
General Council to establish contacts with the French sections in the USA. 
However, passing himself off as an organiser of the International, Cluseret 
ignored the already existing sections in the USA and went beyond his  brief. 
Several sections, including Section No. 1 (see Note 354), protested at Cluseret's 
behaviour and contacted the General Council, Johann Philipp Becker and 
Eugene Varlin with an inquiry about the powers granted to Cluseret. Marx 
replied to the inquiry in his letter to Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt of 9 April 
1870 (see present edition, Vol. 43).—57 
88 Marx is referring to the groundless assertion made by August Vogt, a member 
of German Section No. 1, that Victor Schily, who fought in the 1848-49 
revolution in Germany and belonged to the International, was a spy.—57, 60, 
102 
89 In August 1870 Cincinnati was the scene of the Fifth Congress of the National 
Labor Union, which embraced a number of trade union organisations and 
workers' societies in the USA. The Congress adopted a resolution expressing 
adherence to the principles of the International Working Men's Association and 
the Union's intention to join. 
Sigfrid Meyer was elected delegate of the General Association of German 
Workers which, till the autumn of 1870, was part of the National Labor Union 
(it went under the name of Labor Union No. 5 of New York) and, at the same 
time,  from December 1869, had been a section of the International (Section 
No. 1). Meyer was not able to attend the Congress, and the General Association 
of German Workers was represented by Friedrich Adolph Sorge. —57, 60 
90 This refers to Edward Kellogg's A New Monetary System, which Marx, evidently, 
first read in translation. In February 1871 Sorge sent him the first edition 
which had appeared in New York. This copy of the book with Marx's notes and 
remarks is still in existence.—58

91 In his article 'Notes on the War.—XII' Engels not only forecast the possibility 
of MacMahon's Chalons Army being encircled by the Prussian troops, but also 
pointed quite accurately to the place where it was to happen. Engels' prediction 
came true. On 1 and 2 September 1870, at Sedan, the Prussian troops defeated 
the French army under MacMahon and forced it to capitulate. Over 80,000 
soldiers, officers and generals, Napoleon III among them, were taken prisoner. 
The Sedan catastrophe caused a revolution in Paris on 4 September 1870 which 
led to the collapse of the Second Empire and the proclamation of the republic in 
France. All power passed to the Provisional Government (known as the 
Government of National Defence) headed by the Orleanist Louis Jules 
Trochu.—58, 61 
92 The treaties of Tilsit—peace treaties signed on 7 and 9 July 1807 by Napoleonic 
France, and Russia and Prussia, members of the fourth anti-French coalition. 
In an attempt to split the defeated powers, Napoleon I made no territorial 
claims on Russia. However, Russia, like Prussia, had to abrogate its alliance with 
Britain and, to its disadvantage, join Napoleon's Continental System. The treaty 
of 9 July imposed harsh terms on Prussia, which ceded nearly half its territory 
to the German states dependent on France, was made to pay indemnities and 
had its army reduced.—59 
93 Marx may have had in mind rumours circulating in the press about Russia's 
pro-French orientation and the favourable reception given the French 
Ambassador, General Fleury, at the Russian court.—59 
94 Ferdinand Freiligrath wrote his poem 'An Wolfgang im Felde' on 12 August 
1870 and dedicated it to his son whom he had sent to the front as a 
volunteer.—59 
95 On 12 August 1870 the German philosopher David Friedrich Strauss wrote an 
open letter to Joseph Ernest Renan, the French historian, which was published in 
the supplement to the Allgemeine Zeitung. Strauss urged Renan to admit the justice 
of the rights for which Germany fought in the war and applaud her military 
successes.—59 
96 In his letter to Marx of 26 July 1870, Sigfrid Meyer expressed the opinion that 
Friedrich Sorge was incompetent to carry out his duties as the Corresponding 
Secretary for the General Association of German Workers in the USA.—60 
97 The Arcadians—an extreme right-wing group in the Corps législatif which 
received its name from Rue des Arcades where its members met.—61 
98 The French army under Marshal Bazaine surrendered at the fortress of Metz 
on 27 October 1870.—62, 68

added at the end of Engels' article 'Notes on the War.—XIII', see present 
edition, Vol. 22, Note 45.

Prussians in his 'Notes on the War.—XVII' (see present edition, Vol.

was the proclamation, 'Au peuple allemand, à la démocratie socialiste de la 
nation allemande', written on behalf of the French workers' societies and the 
French sections of the International Working Men's Association. It was 
published as a leaflet on 4 and 5 September 1870 and later in Der 
Volksstaat—6b, 66, 70, 79 
102 See notes 61 and 75.-65 
103 Comités de la défense (defence committees) were set up in a number of major 
French cities in the early stages of the Franco-Prussian War; their main 
function was to organise the supply of provisions for the army.—65, 89 
104 In May 1870 Napoleon Ill's government held a plebiscite in an attempt to 
strengthen the tottering regime of the Second Empire. The issues put to the 
vote were formulated in such a way that disapproval of the policy pursued by 
the Second Empire could not be expressed without opposing all democratic 
reforms at the same time. Despite this, 1.5 million votes were cast against the 
government, with 1.9 million abstentions.—67, 342 
105 A reference to the Danish War, the war waged by Prussia and Austria against 
Denmark in 1864; it was an important step on the way to Germany's unification 
under Prussian supremacy.—67 
106 At the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War members of the German colony 
in Manchester (Carl Schorlemmer, G. Beer, J. G. Wehner and others) organ­
ised a committee to assist the war victims. Engels joined the committee but in 
September 1870, when the war ceased to be defensive on the German side, he 
withdrew.—68 
107 Marx is referring to the Manifesto issued on 5 September 1870 by the 
Brunswick Committee of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (Manifest des 
Ausschusses der sozial-demokratischen Arbeiterpartei. An alle deutschen Arbeiter!). The 
Manifesto proclaimed the German working class's loyalty to the cause of 
internationalism and called on German workers to organise mass protest 
meetings against the Prussian government's plans for annexations. Excerpts 
from the letter which Marx and Engels wrote to the Committee of the 
Social-Democratic Workers' Party (see present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 260-62) 
were included in the Manifesto with a note that they had been written by 'one 
of our oldest and most meritorious comrades in London'.—69, 71, 79, 82 
108 The General Council of the International including Marx played a major part 
in organising the movement of British workers for recognition of the French 
Republic by the British government. From 5 September mass demonstrations 
were held in London, Birmingham, Newcastle and other English cities.—70,

people was published in Der Volksstaat, No. 73, on 11 September 1870 (see

111 Engels is referring to the bourgeois revolution in Spain which began in 
September 1868 when Queen Isabella was dethroned. In the course of the 
revolution Spain was declared a constitutional monarchy. It was not until 
February 1873 that a republic was proclaimed, but it survived less than a year.

In 1874 the big bourgeoisie and landowners brought about the restoration of the 
Bourbons.—71 
112 The Customs Parliament (Zollparlament) was the leading body of the Customs 
Union (Zollverein) reorganised after the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the 
signing of a treaty between Prussia and the South German states on 8 July 
1867,  which stipulated the establishment of such a body. The parliament 
consisted of members of the Reichstag of the North German Confederation 
(see Note 55) and specially elected deputies from the South German 
states—Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hesse. It was to deal exclusively with 
trade and customs policy.— 72 
113 The reference is to the heroic uprising of Paris workers on 23-26 June 
1848.—74, 99, 132 
114 This refers to the Déclaration réglant divers points de droit maritime (Declaration 
Regulating Various Items of Maritime Law), a supplement to the Paris Peace 
Treaty of 1856 which marked the end of the Crimean War of 1853-56. It was 
signed on 16 April 1856 by the representatives of Austria, France, Britain, 
Prussia, Russia, Sardinia and Turkey. The Declaration formulated the rules of 
war at sea, incorporating the principles of armed neutrality, which were 
proclaimed in 1780 by the government of Catherine II and envisaged the 
abolition of privateering, immunity of neutral cargo in enemy vessels and of 
enemy cargo in neutral vessels (with the exception of war contraband), and the 
recognition only of a real blockade. Lord Clarendon, British representative at the 
Paris Congress, signed the Declaration on behalf of his country.—74, 93 
115 On 9 September 1870 Wilhelm Bracke, Leonhard von Bonhorst, Spier, Kühn, 
Gralle, and Ehlers, members of the Brunswick Committee of the German 
Social-Democratic Workers' Party, as well as Sievers, a printer, were arrested 
for publishing the Manifesto on the war on 5 September (see Note 107). In 
November 1871 these members of the Brunswick Committee were brought to 
trial (see Note 335).—75, 77, 79, 82, 85, 96, 196 
n6 Demagogues in Germany were the participants in the students' opposition 
movement after the liberation of the country from Napoleonic rule. After the 
1830 Revolution in France the opposition movement of the so-called 
demagogues became more intense in Germany and gave rise to renewed police 
repression and arrests and increased emigration.—77, 85, 228, 360 
117 The meeting Marx is writing about was called by the Labour Representation 
League (see Note 406) and trade union leaders on 13 September 1870 in 
honour of the French Republic. The resolution moved by George Howell was 
limited to the expression of sympathies with the French people. To oppose this, 
Robert Applegarth, a General Council member, moved a resolution that urged 
the British Government to use all its influence to bring an end to the war 
between France and Germany and to protest against any dismemberment of 
France. The resolution also demanded that a peace treaty be concluded on 
conditions that ensured a lasting peace in Europe. After a prolonged and 
heated discussion Applegarth's resolution was adopted by a majority of 7 
votes. 
By instructions for Belgium, Marx probably meant his letter to César De 
Paepe of 14 September 1870 (see this volume, pp. 79-81). Instructions for 
Switzerland and the United States have not been found.—77, 82

119 Referring to General Vogel von Falkenstein's vandalism in 1866, Marx had in 
mind the following fact: on 16 July 1866, during the Austro-Prussian war, the 
forces under Vogel von Falkenstein occupied the free city of Frankfurt. On his 
orders several senators were arrested, newspapers suppressed, and a heavy 
military indemnity imposed on the city which, on failure to pay, was threatened 
with destruction. These threats by the Prussian command led to the suicide of 
Frankfurt's burgomaster.—79 
120 A reference to 'Manifeste aux Sections de l'Internationale' published in the 
Supplement to La Solidarité', No. 22, on 5 September 1870. It called upon the 
members of the International to take up arms to defend the French bourgeois 
republic proclaimed on 4 September 1870.— 80

122 This is the last letter in the sustained correspondence between Marx in London 
and Engels in Manchester. After retiring from the Ermen & Engels firm in 
Manchester, Engels moved to London on 20 September 1870 and settled not far 
from where Marx lived. After that they wrote to each other only occasionally, 
when one of them left London.—84, 380 
123 This refers to the Manifesto of the Marseilles section of the International 
Working Men's Association, 'Aux travailleurs allemands!', written in the first 
half of September 1870 and printed originally as a leaflet and then, on 
25 September, in L'Internationale, No. 89 and Bulletin de la Fédération ouvrière 
rouennaise, No. 3. Marx sharply criticised this Manifesto for its chauvinistic 
tendencies.—84 
124 Marx is referring to the article printed on 15 September 1870 in The Pall Mall 
Gazette, No. 1744 and dealing unfavourably with Spencer Beesly's pamphlet 
A Word for France: Addressed to the Workmen of London.—85 
125 Marx is speaking about Engels' move to London. See Note 122.— 87 
126 Oswald enclosed with his letter to Marx of 23 September a copy of the letter he 
had sent to Thiers, in which he proposed the establishment of a 'neutral zone' 
between France and Germany. Oswald asked Marx for his opinion on the 
matter.—87 
127 On 19 September 1870 The Times (under the heading 'Russia') published an 
excerpt from the Journal de Saint-Pétersbourg of 17 September 1870 stating that 
France's prestige would not suffer if, in concluding a peace treaty, she agreed to 
demolish her fortresses on the border with Germany.— 88 
128 The news of the defeat at Sedan caused an uprising in Lyons on 4 September 
1870.  On his arrival in Lyons on 15 September, Bakunin tried to assume 
leadership of the movement and carry out his anarchist programme. On 
28 September the anarchists attempted a coup d'état which was a complete 
failure.—88,  162

131 The Thirty Years' War (1618-48)—a European war, in which the Pope, the 
Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs and the Catholic German princes rallied 
under the banner of Catholicism and fought the Protestant countries: Bohemia, 
Denmark, Sweden, the Republic of the Netherlands and a number of 
Protestant German states. The rulers of Catholic France—rivals of the 
Habsburgs—supported the Protestant camp. Germany was the main battle 
arena and the object of plunder and territorial claims. The Treaty of 
Westphalia (1648) sealed the political dismemberment of Germany.—93 
132 Landsturm regulations (Verordnung über den Landsturm) —a law adopted in 
Prussia on 21 April 1813. It envisaged the organisation of detachments which 
were to employ the methods of guerrilla warfare in the rear and on the flanks 
of the Napoleonic army. Engels analysed the regulations in detail in Notes on the 
War, 'Prussian Francs-Tireurs' (present edition, Vol. 22, p. 201).—93

134 On 26 November 1870, when the North German Reichstag discussed the 
question of granting credits for the continuation of the war against France, 
Bebel and Liebknecht spoke against credits and for a speedy peace treaty with 
the French Republic without annexations. On 17 December, after the Reichstag 
session had drawn to a close, Bebel, Liebknecht and Hepner were arrested and 
charged with high treason.—95 
135 xhe German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 
1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the 
Just. The Society's leaders played a prominent part in founding the Communist 
League (1847). In 1847 and 1849-50, Marx and Engels took an active part in 
the Society's work, but on 17 September 1850 Marx, Engels and a number of 
their followers temporarily withdrew because the sectarian and adventurist 
faction led by August Willich and Karl Schapper had increased its influence in 
the Society. In the late 1850s Marx and Engels resumed their work in the 
Society. When the International was established the Society became its German 
Section in London and from late 1871 it was a section of the British 
Federation. The German Workers' Educational Society in London existed until 
1918,  when it was closed down by the British Government.—96, 178, 233, 279,

136 On 19 December 1870 The Times published Gladstone's letter, dated 
15 December, which announced an amnesty of the condemned Fenians (on the 
Fenians see Note 6). However, this amnesty was hedged round with numerous 
reservations, which caused Engels to compare it with the shabby amnesty of 
political prisoners announced in Prussia in January 1861 on the occasion of 
William Fs accession to the throne.—96

138 xhe Cologne Communist trial (4 October-12 November 1852) was organised and 
stage-managed by the Prussian Government. The defendants were members of 
the Communist League arrested in the spring of 1851 on charges of 
'treasonable plotting'. The forged documents and false evidence presented by 
the police authorities were not only designed to secure the conviction of the 
defendants but also to compromise their London comrades and the proletarian 
organisation as a whole. Seven of the defendants were sentenced to 
imprisonment in a fortress for terms ranging from three to six years. (See 
K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, present edition, 
Vol. 11.)—97, 130, 320 
139 At the General Council meeting of 17 January 1871 (see present edition, Vol. 
22, pp. 571-72), Marx strongly criticised George Odger, a trade union leader, 
who had praised the Government of National Defence and its Foreign Minister 
Jules Favre at a meeting in St James's Hall in London on 10 January.—98 
140 This refers to Administrative Resolution VI passed by the Basle Congress, 'The 
Procedure for Expelling Sections from the Association'. It conferred on the 
General Council the right to suspend individual sections of the International 
until the meeting of the next Congress.—99 
141 The reference is to the reactionary laws passed by the Constituent Assembly of 
the French Republic after the suppression of the June 1848 insurrection. The 
press laws of 11 July and 11 August envisaged severe punishment for the 
printing of articles against the government, the existing order and private 
property. The decree on clubs, adopted on 28 July 1848, placed them under 
the surveillance of the authorities.—99 
142 In April 1849 the French bourgeois government, in alliance with Austria and 
Naples, intervened against the Roman Republic for the purpose of suppressing 
it and restoring the Pope's secular power. Despite its heroic resistance the 
Roman Republic was overthrown and Rome occupied by French troops.—99 
143 Marx is referring to his work on the third book of Capital, which was, with the 
second book, to form Volume II of Capital (see also Note 219). 
Marx planned to make a special study of agrarian relations in the United 
States in connection with his examination of the origin of rent. 
The American Civil War (1861-65) was caused mainly by the struggle 
between two social systems—the capitalist system of wage labour in the North 
and the slave system in the South. Workers, farmers and the Black population 
played a decisive role in the defeat of the slave-owners of the South and the 
conclusion of the war in favour of the North.—100 
144 In early February 1871, at Marx's request, Harney sent a written inquiry to the 
General Land Office in Washington (see The Harney Papers. Ed. by F. G. Black 
and R. M. Black, Van Gorcum and Co., Assen, 1969, pp. 267-69).—100 
146 The second German edition of Volume I of Capital appeared between July 
1872 and April 1873 in nine separate instalments, and in June 1873 it was 
published as a book. While preparing this edition Marx partly revised the text 
and introduced some changes in its structure.—100, 362, 367, 377, 385, 409,

146 Volume I of Capital was translated into Russian by Hermann Lopatin, Nikolai 
Danielson and Nikolai Lyubavin. It was the first translation of his work into any 
foreign language. The book was published in full in the spring of 1872 except for 
the portrait of Marx, because the censor had forbidden its reproduction in the 
Russian edition.—100, 578 
147 The translation of Volume I of Capital into French, started by Charles Keller, 
was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War. The first French edition appeared 
in separate instalments between 1872 and 1875 in a translation by Joseph Roy. 
Roy's translation being too literal, Marx virtually retranslated the whole book, 
introducing changes as against the second German edition.— 100, 212, 258, 283, 
327 
148 Xhis may refer to Nahmer, a German émigré living in New York, who wrote to 
Marx on 20 September 1867 offering his services as a translator of Capital 
The English translation of Volume I of Capital, edited by Engels, was 
published in London in 1887; half of the printed copies were distributed in the 
USA. Later the London edition was reprinted in New York.—100

(see Note 108) gained fresh momentum in Britain at the end of December

151 The Central Committee of the International Working Men's Association for the United 
States was formed on 1 December 1870 by delegates from several sections of 
the International: German Section No. 1, French Section No. 2 and Czech 
Section No. 3, with powers for a  year.—101,  106, 217, 242, 244, 273 
152 Marx is referring to the article 'On the Condition of West-European Workers 
from the Social and Hygienic Points of View', written by P. I. Yakobi and 
V. A. Zaitsev and published in the journal Arkhiv sudebnoi meditsiny i 
obshchestvennoi gigiyeny (Archives of Forensic Medicine and Social Hygiene), 
Book 3 for 1870, under the initials 'P. Ya.'. The article was based mainly on the 
first volume of Marx's Capital A few copies of the journal appeared with this 
article and were sold out, then the censor stepped in and the article was 
banned. 
Marx received this information from Hermann Lopatin.—105

157 This refers to the Convention on the Armistice and Capitulation of Paris signed by 
Bismarck and Favre on 28 January 1871, after the Government of National 
Defence had ceased all resistance to the Prussian invaders and agreed to an 
ignominious surrender. In so doing, it sacrificed the national interests of France to 
the interests of the ruling classes, which needed all the available forces to suppress 
the revolutionary movement in the country. In signing the Convention Favre 
accepted the humiliating demands of the Prussians: payment of an indemnity of 
200 million francs within a fortnight, immediate surrender of most of the Paris 
forts,  handing over of the field guns and ammunition of the Paris army, and the 
disbanding of the francs-tireurs (see Note 130). The Convention provided for 
speedy elections to the National Assembly to decide on the question of a peace 
treaty.—109, 112, 197 
158 This refers to the delegation of the Government of National Defence sent to 
Tours in mid-September 1870 to organise resistance to the German invasion in 
the provinces and to carry on external relations. From the beginning of 
October till the end of the war the delegation was headed by Gambetta. In 
early December 1870, it moved to Bordeaux.—109, 113 
159 On the surrender at Sedan see Note 91.—109, 113 
160 Marx is referring to a decree issued by Gambetta on 31 January 1871 which 
deprived all persons who had held high official posts during the Second 
Empire of the right to stand for election. On 3 February Bismarck sent a 
protest to Gambetta referring him to the clause on 'freedom of elections'. The 
government in Paris also issued a decree on electoral procedure which led to a 
serious conflict between Gambetta and the other members of the government, 
after which Gambetta resigned.—110, 113 
161 The indemnity which Bismarck demanded from France and which she 
undertook to pay under the treaty was  5,000  million francs. The report on the 
armistice published in The Times on 2 February 1871 spoke of 10,000 million 
francs.—110, 113 
162 King William I of Prussia was proclaimed Emperor of Germany on 18 January 
1871.—110, 114 
163 This presumably refers to the arrest and deportation of Joseph Schneider, a 
Frankfurt worker nominated in Stuttgart as a candidate for the Reichstag 
elections. This was reported by Der Volksstaat, 1 February 1871.—113 
164 This letter is evidently an answer to Lavrov's inquiry concerning Hermann 
Lopatin's fate. From Lopatin's letter of 15 December 1870 Marx already knew 
that the latter was in Russia to make arrangements for Nikolai Chernyshevsky's 
escape from exile; however, probably for reasons of secrecy, he disclosed 
neither Lopatin's whereabouts nor the purpose of his trip.—115

the First International Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new

166 This is Marx's reply to letters he had received from Wilhelm Liebknecht's wife 
Natalie, dated 18 January, 22 and 27 February 1871. Natalie Liebknecht 
informed Marx that she could not send a receipt for monies received for the 
benefit of the families of the leaders of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party 
who had been arrested in Germany. Such a receipt, she wrote, might have been

used as additional evidence against Liebknecht and Bebel who had been 
charged with high treason. One of the points on the indictment was the 
affiliation of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party to the International 
Working Men's Association since Prussian laws banned participation of German 
political parties and associations in any international organisation.—115 
167 In his article 'The International Working Men's Association' (The Fortnightly 
Review, p. 531) Beesly wrote that the members of the International 'are all 
Republicans, and all determined opponents of war. In both these qualities they 
have drawn upon themselves the persecution of the despots of France and 
Prussia'.—116 
168 In a letter of 8 October 1865 Lothar Bucher invited Marx to become the 
London financial correspondent of the Königlich Preußischer Staats-Anzeiger, and 
also suggested that Marx change sides and back Bismarck's government. These 
attempts to bribe him met with vehement protests from Marx (see present 
edition, Vol. 42, p. 202). 
At the Battle of Sadowa (3 July 1866) in the Austro-Prussian war the 
Austrian army sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Prussian 
troops.—116 
169 Marx has in mind Papiers et Correspondance de la Famille Impériale, published in 
two volumes in Paris at the end of 1870 and the beginning of 1871. Volume I 
included despatches by Minister Emile Ollivier in which he ordered the arrest 
of members of the International. These measures by the Bonapartist 
government were connected with preparations for a plebiscite called for 8 May 
1870 (see Note 104). 
. On the eve of the plebiscite, members of the Paris Federation of the 
International were arrested and charged with conspiring to assassinate 
Napoleon III. Persecution of members of the International began simultane­
ously in Lyons, Rouen, Marseilles and other cities. The third trial of members of 
the Paris Federation was held from 22 June to 5 July 1870; the detainees were 
sentenced for being members of the International.—-116 
170 On 29 November 1850 Olmiitz (Olomouc) was the scene of a meeting between 
the Prime Ministers of Prussia and Austria, Baron von Manteuffel and Prince 
von Schwarzenberg. Under pressure from Nicholas I, Emperor of Russia, 
Prussia renounced her plans for suppressing the uprising in the Electorate of 
Hesse and complied with Austrian demands. 
On the initiative of Nicholas I negotiations between the Austrian Chancellor 
Prince von Schwarzenberg and the Prussian Prime Minister Count von 
Brandenburg had taken place in Warsaw in October 1850. The point at issue 
was the conflict between Austria and Prussia over supremacy in Germany. 
During this meeting Nicholas I intimated that he was firmly on Austria's 
side.—120 
171 The French newspaper Paris-Journal, in issue No. 71, 14 March 1871, carried 
an article, 'Le Grand Chef de l'Internationale', alleging that it had in its 
possession a letter from Marx to Auguste Serraillier testifying to strife between 
the French and German members of the International; on 19 March this 
forged letter attributed to Marx was published in the newspaper. The 
slanderous statement was reprinted in bourgeois newspapers of various 
countries, including The Times The attempts by the Paris-Journal to split the 
French and German members of the International were exposed by Marx at 
the General Council meeting of 21 March 1871 and also in a letter Engels 
wrote at his request to The Times (for the Times version of this letter see

present edition, Vol. 22, p. 285). In addition, at Marx's request Serraillier wrote 
a letter on 16 March 1871 exposing the slander of the Paris-Journal (a clipping 
from the Courrier de l'Europe with the text of Serraillier's letter was enclosed by 
Marx with his letter to Paul Lafargue). 
At its meeting of 21 March 1871 the General Council exposed another 
provocative invention of the French reactionary press—the alleged expulsion of 
persons of German nationality from the Paris sections of the International.— 
121, 124, 130 
172 In the first half of March 1871, the French bourgeois papers, notably the 
Paris-Journal and the Gaulois, actively campaigned for the foundation of a 
so-called Anti-German League.—122 
173 The Jockey Club—an aristocratic club founded in Paris in 1833.—122 
174 A meeting of Germans belonging to the propertied classes was held in Zurich 
in March 1871 to celebrate Germany's victory in the Franco-Prussian War. The 
meeting was the scene of a clash between a group of French officers interned 
in Switzerland and the Germans. The reactionary press tried to put the blame 
on the International. The Swiss section of the International exposed the 
slander in a special statement.—122 
175 On 22 March 1871 the royalists attempted to stage a counter-revolutionary 
putsch in Paris under the pretext of a peaceful demonstration. Its aim was the 
restoration of the bourgeois regime overthrown by the proletarian revolution of 
18 March 1871. One of the main organisers of the putsch was Henri de Pêne, 
editor of the Paris-Journal (see K. Marx, The Civil War in France, present 
edition, Vol. 22, pp. 324-26).—124, 128 
176 'Hauptchef (principal leader)—the description given by Wilhelm Stieber, 
organiser of the 1852 Cologne Communist trial (see Note 138), to Julien Cherval, 
an agent provocateur, in an attempt to ascribe to him a leading role in the 
Communist League (see K. Marx, Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in 
Cologne, present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 407-19).—124 
177 Marx and Engels learned about the strike of the cigar-workers in Antwerp 
from a letter written by Philippe Coenen, an organiser of the International's 
sections in Belgium and the Netherlands, on 29 March 1871. They immediately 
took steps to organise international aid for the strikers. At the General Council 
meeting of 4 April 1871 Engels spoke about the strike and proposed that the 
Council send letters and delegations to the British trade unions to organise 
support. 
In response to the General Council's appeal, money to the Antwerp 
cigar-workers was sent by a number of British trades unions and by the 
workers of Brussels, where the cigar-workers walked out in solidarity. 
The support by the General Council of the Antwerp cigar-workers 
defending their trade union enabled them to hold out till September 1871 and 
to push through their demands.—125, 127, 145, 190 
178 Wilhelm Liebknecht, August Bebel and Adolf Hepner, arrested on 17 De­
cember 1870 on a charge of high treason (see Note 134), were released from 
detention on 28 March 1871. Their trial took place in March 1872 (see Note 
274).—127 
179 Engels is referring to a message of greetings to the Paris Commune members 
which was adopted on 26 March 1871 at a meeting of the General Association 
of German Workers in Elberfeld. The message was despatched direcdy to Paris,

while a second copy, for safety's sake, was sent to the General Council, and 
later Eccarius forwarded it to Commune member Léo Frankel. —127 
180 On 4 October 1871 Der Volksstaat, No. 80, carried an item unmasking Blind as 
a chauvinist and phrasemonger who, by self-praise, tried to make a reputation 
for himself as a public figure.—129 
181 On 15 April 1871 Der Volksstaat, No. 31, carried a note reprinted from the Petit 
Journal of 5 April, which Marx sent to Liebknecht. It read: 'May we ask Mr 
Stieber, Chief of the German Police, in what kind of wagons he sent to Prussia the 
clocks, vases and statues from the apartment he occupied on the Königs-
Boulevard? '—129 
182 Liebknecht used the information sent by Marx for the report published in Der 
Volksstaat, No. 31, 15 April 1871, unmasking Karl Vogt as a paid Bonapartist 
agent.—130 
183 This refers to preparations for a trial of the Brunswick Committee members 
who were arrested on 9 September 1870 (see Note 115). The charge of 'causing 
a breach of the peace' was 'based', i.a., on the fact that they were members of the 
International Working Men's Association. The trial took place in November 1871 
(see Note 335).—130, 288 
184 After the victorious uprising of the Paris proletariat on 18 March 1871, power 
was in the hands of the Central Committee of the National Guard, which 
surrendered it to the Commune on 28 March following the elections of 
26 March 1871.—132

186 The reference is to Ferdinand Freiligrath's poem 'An Joseph Weydemeyer', 
an attack on Gottfried Kinkel, written in January 1852 (Marx has, erroneous­
ly, '1851') specially for Die Revolution, a journal published in the USA by 
Weydemeyer. Since its publication in America was delayed, Freiligrath 
published this poem in the literary newspaper Morgenblatt für gebildete Leser 
(No.  10, 7 March 1852) printed in Stuttgart and Tübingen. In America the 
poem was published in May 1852.—135 
187 In his letter to Marx written around 10 April 1871, Liebknecht asked his 
consent to reprint articles from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische 
Revue, and requested Marx to send a complete run of the journal. 
The magazine published several reviews by Marx and Engels, three 
international reviews written jointly by them, as- well as Marx's The Class 
Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 and Louis Napoleon and  Fould,  and Engels' The 
Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution, The English Ten Hours' Bill and 
The Peasant War in Germany (see present edition, Vol. 10).—135 
188 xhis refers to Section 2 ('The So-Called Primitive Accumulation') of the last, 
sixth Chapter of the first German edition of Volume I of Capital When 
preparing the second German edition of this volume, which appeared in 
1872-73,  Marx made this section into a separate Chapter. In the authorised 
English edition Engels changed the composition of the volume making this 
Chapter into Part VIII (see present edition, Vol. 35).—135

Dr. Kugelmann, Co-operative Publishing Society of Foreign Workers in the 
USSR, Moscow-Leningrad, 1934, and in: K. Marx, The Civil War in France, 
Kerr, Chicago, 1934.—136 
191 On 13 June 1849 the petty-bourgeois Party of the Mountain organised a 
peaceful demonstration in Paris to protest against the infringements of the 
Constitution of the French Republic by the President and the majority of the 
Legislative Assembly. The demonstration was easily dispersed by government 
troops. It confirmed the bankruptcy of petty-bourgeois democracy in 
France.— 136 
192 The International Democratic Association included petty-bourgeois French and 
German emigres in London and also English bourgeois Republicans. 
In April 1871 members of the Association founded the Universal 
Republican League. Its leaders invited the General Council of the International to 
join, but their proposal was rejected unanimously at the General Council meeting 
on 25 April 1871. 
With his letter Engels enclosed a newspaper clipping with the League's 
programme.—137 
193 The Poor Law of 1834—An Act for the Amendment and Better Administration 
of the Laws Relating to the Poor in England and Wales—provided for only one 
form of relief for the able-bodied poor: workhouses with a prison-like 
regime.—138 
194 Its revolutionary publications brought Der Volksstaat frequent harassment from 
the Prussian government. In April alone several issues were impounded 'for 
insulting state authorities and the Emperor of Germany'.—138, 158 
195 These are notes for a reply to Francisco Mora (the letter itself has not been 
found) Engels made on an official message sent by the Spanish Federal Council to 
the General Council on 11 April 1871 in connection with the spinners' strike in 
Barcelona. The document is marked by Engels: 'Received 18 April.'—139 
196 A reference to the appeal The Civil War in  France,  on which Marx was working at 
the time. It was first published in London on 13 June 1871, in English, as a 
pamphlet of 35 pages in 1,000 copies.—140, 141 
197 Marx is speaking of the campaign started by the General Council of the 
International to explain to British workers the historical significance of the 
revolution in France. The Council organised a number of mass meetings in 
London, Manchester and other cities in defence of the Paris Commune.—140 
198 This letter was first published in English in full in: Karl Marx and Frederick 
Engels, On the Paris Commune, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1971.—141 
199 Marx drafted this letter after the General Council, at its meeting of 25 April 
1871,  had entrusted him with answering the slanderous inventions of the 
French petty-bourgeois democrat Félix Pyat, who had attacked General Council 
member Auguste Serraillier in connection with the elections to the Paris 
Commune.—141 
200 This refers to Tridon's letter to the editors of La Cigale, who published it in 
No. 29, 19 July 1868 under the heading 'La commune révolutionnaire de

Paris'.  Tridon, who was a Blanquist, condemned the provocative speech made by 
Pyat at a meeting held in Cleveland Hall, London, on 29 June 1868, to 
celebrate the anniversary of the June 1848 uprising. At this meeting Pyat read 
out an appeal, which he had allegedly received from the 'Paris Revolutionary 
Commune', a secret society, and moved a resolution proclaiming the 
assassination of Napoleon III to be the sacred duty of every Frenchman. 
The same issue of La Cigale carried a resolution of the General Council 
disavowing Pyat's behaviour (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 7).—141 
201 This refers to Karl Vogt's Politische Briefe an Friedrich Kolb, a pamphlet 
published in the autumn of 1870, in which the author tried to camouflage his 
one-time ties with the Bonapartists. This pamphlet was criticised by Engels in 
his article 'Once Again "Herr Vogt'" (see present edition, Vol. 22).—144 
202 On 3 May 1871 Liebknecht wrote to Marx that after the publication in Der 
Volksstaat of an item about Vogt receiving subsidies from funds belonging to 
the Bonaparte family (see Note 182), he was reproached for unnecessarily 
returning to the 'Vogt affair'. Liebknecht stressed the need to publish more 
material on this question. In connection with this, Engels sent to Der Volksstaat 
his article 'Once Again "Herr Vogt"' (see present edition, Vol. 22). 
On the People's Party see Note 71.—145 
203 Bebel was released from detention on 28 March 1871 and on 3 April he spoke 
in the German Reichstag during the debate on the proposition made by the 
representatives of several bourgeois parties to include articles 'on basic rights' 
(freedom of the press, association, speech, etc.) in the German Constitution. Bebel 
asserted that in the German Empire all these rights were purely abstract 
and that all possible measures, including the use of revolutionary force, had to 
be taken for their genuine implementation.—145 
204 This refers to the choice of candidates for the post of Secretary of the General 
Council following Eccarius' resignation as secretary on 9 May 1871. The 
committee of the General Council with Jung as chairman proposed Hales and 
Mottershead. During the discussion in the General Council questions were 
raised concerning the expulsion of Hales from the Elastic Web-Weavers' Society 
in 1867. When it was explained that the decision on expulsion had later been 
revoked, Hales was elected Secretary of the General Council on 16 May 
1871.—147 
205 An allusion to the fact that at that time the salary of the General Council's 
Secretary was 15s. per week. From mid-May 1871 it was reduced to 10s. per 
week.—147 
206 On the night of 8 May 1871 the Paris Communards abandoned Fort Issy after 
ten days of bombardment by the Versailles troops that besieged Paris.—148 
207 Marx drafted this letter in reply to Léo Frankel's letter written around 25 April 
1871,  in which he informed Marx about his election to the Executive of the 
Commune and requested advice concerning its work. 
This letter was published in English for the first time in part in: Karl Marx 
and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary

209 -r^e finai peace treaty between France and the German Empire was signed in 
Frankfurt am Main on 10 May 1871. (The date given by Marx is a slip of the 
pen.) According to the terms of the preliminary peace treaty signed on 
26 February 1871 at Versailles, France ceded Alsace and East Lorraine to 
Germany and paid 5 thousand million francs indemnity; until the indemnity 
was paid part of French territory continued to be occupied by the German 
troops. Under the treaty of 10 May France was to pay indemnities on more 
onerous terms and the occupation of French territory by the German troops 
was prolonged in exchange for help rendered by Bismarck to the Versailles 
Government in suppressing the Commune.—149 
210 According to newspaper reports, out of the domestic loan that the government 
of the Third Republic had decided to float, Thiers and his ministers, Finance 
Minister Pouyer-Quertier among them, were to receive over 300 million francs 
by way of 'commission'. The law on the loan was passed on 20 June 1871, after 
the suppression of the Commune.—149

212 Towards the end of April 1871 Marx's daughters Jenny and Eleanor set out for 
Bordeaux to visit Laura and Paul Lafargue; in June all of them moved to 
Bagnères-de-Luchon. Early in August, fearful of persecution, Lafargue left for 
Spain and Laura followed him. Jenny and Eleanor were arrested in Luchon 
and later expelled from France. On this see K. Marx, 'Letter to the Editor of 
The Sun, Charles Dana' and Jenny Marx's Letter to the Editor of Woodhull & 
Claflin's Weekly (present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 396-99, 622).—150, 153, 177,

29 April; Nos. 501-504, 20 and 27 May,3and 10 June 1871. Clippings of some of 
the articles with Marx's notes have been preserved in his archive.—150 
214 Comtism or positivism—a trend in philosophy, sociology and historiography that 
arose in the 1830s, its leading proponent being Auguste Comte, the French 
sociologist. The positivists extended methods of natural science to the study of 
society. They saw the historical process in terms of slow evolutionary changes and 
denied the role of revolutions.—150 
215 In November 1864, The Bee-Hive became the official organ of the 
International Working Men's Association, but, being closely linked with trade 
union leaders and bourgeois radicals, it remained a narrow trade unionist 
newspaper (see Marx's letter to Sigfrid Meyer of 4 July 1868, present edition, 
Vol. 43). Its editors delayed the publication of the International's documents 
and tampered with reports of the General Council meetings. The question of 
severing all links with the Bee-Hive editors was discussed in the General 
Council on 26 April 1870; Marx took part in the discussion (see present

edition, Vol. 21, p. 444) and was asked to draft a resolution to this effect which 
he presented to the General Council at its meeting on 17 May 1870.—150 
216 At the same time as the official peace treaty between the German Empire and 
France was signed in Frankfurt am Main on 10 May 1871 (see Note 209), 
Bismarck and Favre made a secret verbal agreement on joint action against 
the Commune (negotiations had begun on 6 May 1871). The agreement 
allowed the Versailles troops to pass through the German lines, and the 
stopping of food supplies to Paris; the German High Command, moreover, was 
to present the Commune with an ultimatum demanding the dismantling of the 
fortifications protecting Paris. The Versailles troops invaded Paris on 21 May 
1871. 
Evidently Marx has in mind his letter to Léo Frankel and Louis Eugène 
Varlin of 13 May 1871. See this volume, pp. 148-49.—151 
217 This refers to the Communist League, the first German and international 
communist organisation of the proletariat, formed under the leadership of 
Marx and Engels in London early in June 1847 as a result of the reorganisation 
of the League of the Just. The programme and organisational principles of the 
Communist League were drawn up with the participation of Marx and Engels. 
The Communist League's members took an active part in the bourgeois-
democratic revolution in Germany in 1848-49. In 1849 and 1850, after the 
defeat of the revolution, it was reorganised and continued its activities. Owing 
to police persecution and arrests of League members, in May 1851 the activities 
of the Communist League as an organisation practically ceased in Germany. On 
17 November 1852, on a motion by Marx, the League announced its 
dissolution.—151 
218 In his letter of 11 (23) May 1871, Nikolai Danielson informed Marx that 
Hermann Lopatin could not complete the translation of Capital into Russian and 
had asked Danielson to finish the work. Knowing from Lopatin that Marx 
intended to revise the first chapter of the first German edition of Capital, 
Volume I, for the Russian edition, Danielson asked Marx to send him the new 
version of the chapter. Being very busy at the time, Marx was unable to revise the 
chapter for the first Russian edition. In preparing the second German edition of 
Volume I of Capital Marx substantially revised the chapter and turned it into 
Part I, 'Commodities and Money' (see present edition, Vol. 35). 
On the Russian edition of Capital see Note 146.—152, 238, 263, 265 
2,9 In his letter to Marx, dated 11 (23) May 1871, Danielson wrote: '"Our mutual 
friend" [Lopatin], speaking in friendly company to people interested in the 
continuation of your work, said that your publisher, owing to commercial 
considerations, does not wish to print Volume II, which you have ready in 
manuscript, before Volume I has been sold out.' However, Volume II, which 
included the 2nd and 3rd books of Capital, was not actually ready for publication. 
After Marx's death Engels prepared the relevant manuscripts for the press and 
published them as Volumes II and III of Capital—152 
220 A reference to Lopatin's trip to Siberia to arrange Chernyshevsky's escape from 
exile. In February 1871 Lopatin was arrested and imprisoned in Irkutsk. He 
attempted to escape on 3 June but was caught immediately. 
Apparently Marx did not know yet of Lopatin's arrest and did not 
understand Danielson's allusion to the matter in his letter of 11 (23) May 1871. 
However, aware of the danger Lopatin was facing he tried to warn him through 
Danielson.—152

Notes 617 
221 Danielson regularly supplied Marx with Russian literature chiefly on economic 
problems. Among the printed matter which Danielson sent Marx in May 1871 
was Chernyshevsky's work On Landed  Property,  published in Sovremennik, Nos. 9 
and 11 for 1857.—152 
222 Marx gave his advice in the form of medical prescriptions, knowing full well 
that his correspondence with Lafargue was under close surveillance. According 
to records in the French police archives, some of the letters sent by Paul Lafargue 
to Marx were intercepted.—153 
223 Engels' contract with his partner Gottfried Ermen expired on 30 June 1869, so 
he resigned from the firm Ermen & Engels. —156 
224 Jules Favre's Circular of 6 June 1871 to the diplomatic representatives of France 
urged the European governments to join forces in combating the International 
Working Men's Association. The Standing Committee of the General Council, at 
its meeting on 11 June 1871, discussed the text of the 'Statement by the General 
Council on Jules Favre's Circular' (see present edition, Vol. 22), drafted by Marx 
and Engels. The Statement was adopted by the General Council on 13 June and 
published in many papers, including The Eastern  Post,  No. 142, 17 June 1871, a 
copy of which was appended to the letter.—158 
225 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx and 
Frederick Engels, On the Paris Commune, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 
1971.—159, 228 
226 Yhe German translation of Marx's The Civil War in France was made by Engels 
and published in Der Volksstaat (Nos.  52-61,  28 June and 1, 5, 8, 12, 16, 19, 
22, 26 and 29 July 1871), and, in abridged form, in Der Vorbote in 
August-October 1871; it also came out as a pamphlet in Leipzig.—159, 161, 
166, 215 
227 No sooner had The Civil War in France been published than numerous hostile 
comments appeared in the bourgeois press, for example, in The Evening Standard, 
No. 14623, 14 June 1871 (leader); The Spectator, No. 2242, 17 June 1871, 'The 
English Communists on Paris'; The Pall Mall Gazette, No. 1979, 17 June 1871, 
'The International Working Men's Association'(leader); The Standard, No. 14627, 
19 June 1871 (leader); The Times, No. 27093, 19 June 1871 (leader); The Times, 
No. 27095, 21 June 1871 (leader).—159 
228 Following his expulsion from Prussia in 1865, Liebknecht became a Hessian 
subject but settled in Saxony. On 24 May 1871 Liebknecht wrote to Engels 
about his intention to give up Hessian citizenship and apply for Saxonian 
citizenship because he was in danger of being expelled from Saxony too. 
In the same letter Liebknecht asked Engels to recommend him as a 
correspondent for The Pall Mall Gazette; he also suggested that the Reynolds's 
Weekly Newspaper be used to publish the International's documents.—159, 166 
229 Apparently an allusion to the National Liberals—the party formed by members of 
the German, mostly Prussian, big bourgeoisie in the autumn of 1866 after a split in 
the Party of Progress (see Note 236). The policy of the National Liberals reflected 
the German liberal bourgeoisie's capitulation to Bismarck. After the unification 
of Germany in 1871 it became increasingly subservient to the government.—

230 Bebel spoke in the Reichstag on 25 May 1871 during the debate on the 
annexation of Alsace and Lorraine to the German Empire. He passionately 
defended the Paris Communards and ended by saying that'the battlecry of the 
Paris proletariat—"War on the palaces, peace to the huts, death to privation 
and idleness"—will become the battlecry of the entire European pro­
letariat'.—160 
231 Engels' letters to Carlo Cafiero of  l[-3],  16 and 28 July 1871, written in 
English, were confiscated by the police when Cafiero was arrested in August 
1871.  They were translated into Italian by a police translator. These copies 
were discovered in 1946 by the Italian historian Aldo Romano among the 
documents of the prefecture at the State Archives in Naples. Engels' original 
letters have not been traced. 
In the texts published in this volume, obvious distortions and errors by the 
translator and copyist have been corrected. 
The letter of l[-3] July 1871 was published in English for the first time in 
part in: Marx, Engels, Lenin, Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism, Progress 
Publishers, Moscow, 1972.—161, 170, 180 
232 Engels' intention to establish correspondence with L. Castellazzo, whose address 
he knew from Carlo Cafiero, did not materialise. In his letter of 28 June 1871, 
Cafiero informed Engels that Castellazzo and the Florentine Société Democratica 
Internazionale were being harassed by the police.—162 
233 A reference to Jules Favre's Circular of 6 June 1871 addressed to the 
diplomatic representatives of France (see Note 224). In his Circular Favre 
made use of police forgeries and documents of the Alliance.—164 
234 At the General Council meeting of 4 July 1871, Paolo Tibaldi, a Paris Commune 
fighter, exposed Luigi Wolff as a paid agent of the French police. The statement 
was published in The Eastern Post, No. 145, 8 July 1871.—164, 173 
235 Engels made a tour of Lombardy in the summer of 1841.—165 
236 xhe Party of  Progress  was formed by members of the Prussian liberal bourgeoisie in 
June 1861. It advocated the unification of Germany under Prussian supremacy, 
the convocation of an all-German parliament, and the establishment of a liberal 
ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. In 1866, after a split in the Party 
of Progress, its Right wing, the National Liberals (see Note 229), formed a 
separate party. Following the unification of Germany in 1871, the Left wing 
declared themselves the party of opposition, but this opposition remained only on 
paper.—166, 289

Organ des gesamten Osterlandes, was founded in the summer of 1870 in

in the campaign of slander against the International started by the bourgeois 
press when this Address was published. At its meetings on 20 and 27 June 
1871 the General Council unanimously condemned Odger and Lucraft and 
accepted their resignations.—167, 186, 215, 233

Men's Association. In this connection Marx and Engels officially broke off 
relations with the paper and on 4 July informed the General Council of their 
decision.—167 
240 Marx wrote this in reply to the letter the lawyer Léon Bigot had sent to the 
Secretary of the General Council of the International Working Men's 
Association. When a group of Communards were court-martialled in Paris (see 
Note 268) Bigot defended the accused Adolphe Alphonse Assi, a member of 
the Central Committee of the National Guard and the Paris Commune. In his 
letter, written with Assi's consent, Bigot asked the International's leaders what 
they thought of the slanderous accusation 'of spreading false rumours' about 
Assi which the bourgeois papers had levelled against Marx. 
The letter is printed from the rough copy Marx made in a notebook where, 
under the heading 'Affaire Assi', a collection of material is to be found relating to 
the above-mentioned affair.—167 
241 Marx wrote this letter in reply to A. O. Rutson, private secretary to' Bruce, 
British Home Secretary. Rutson had asked Marx to send him copies of all official 
documents issued by the General Council of the International Working Men's 
Association.—169 
242 On 17 May 1870 the General Council resolved to convene the Fifth Congress of 
the International in Mainz. However, the Congress was unable to meet owing 
to the Franco-Prussian War that broke out in July 1870 (see Note 40).—169, 237, 
260 
243 This refers to the 'Address to Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States 
of America' (see present edition, Vol. 20) written by Marx on the occasion of 
Lincoln's re-election as President. The Address was forwarded to Lincoln 
through Adams, the American envoy to London. 
On 28 January 1865, Adams, on behalf of Lincoln, handed over the reply 
to the Address of the Central (General) Council. It was published in The Times on 
6 February 1865.—169 
244 In his letter of 28 June 1871 Cafiero informed Engels that a Russian lady, one 
of his 'socialist republican' friends, had started to translate The Civil War in 
France into Russian. Nothing is known of the fate of this translation.—170 
245 The Civil War in France was published in French for the first time in 
L'Internationale in Brussels in July-September 1871 and in L'Égalité in Geneva 
in August-October 1871. It appeared between separate covers in Brussels 
in June 1872. In Spain Marx's work was published in La Emancipaciôn in 
July-September 1871. The publication of the Italian edition, started in 
L'Èguaglianza (Girgenti) in November-December 1871, was not completed. The 
Dutch edition appeared in De Toekomst in June-July 1871. On the German 
translation of The Civil War in France see Note 226.—170, 400, 583

the Florentine Società Democratica Internationale he should write to Francesco 
Piccini, a shoemaker.—170

249 An allusion to the documents of the International Working Men's Association 
published by the General Council which Danielson asked Marx to send to him 
via Berlin for reasons of secrecy, giving the following address: Berlin poste 
restante. Herrn Kirschbaum —174 
250 xhe letter has been preserved in the form of a resume in Marx's notebook of 
excerpts. It was written in reply to Charles Caron's letter to Hermann Jung of 
15 July 1871, in which Caron informed Jung that the New Orleans Club 
International et Républicain wanted to affiliate to the International Working 
Men's Association. The Club was admitted into the International as Section 
No. 15.—176 
231 In June 1871 the General Council began to raise funds and distribute them 
among the Commune refugees; it also found jobs for them. In July the 
General Council formed a special Relief Committee which included Marx, 
Engels, Jung and other members of the Council. On 5 September 1871 Marx 
and Engels, being busy with the preparations for the London Conference of 1871, 
resigned from the Committee. Marx nevertheless continued to take an active part 
in organising assistance to the Commune refugees.—176, 202, 326, 566 
252 A reference to the second German edition of Engels' work, The Peasant War in 
Germany, put out by the Volksstaat Publishers in 1870.—178 
253 Engels has in mind Borkheim's work, Zur Erinnerung für die deutschen 
Mordspatrioten. 1806-1807, which was published in Lier Volksstaat in July-
September 1871 and was to appear as a pamphlet some time later; A. Bebel's 
pamphlets Unsere Ziele (second edition) and Die Reden  Bebel's,  which were issued 
in August 1871 by the Volksstaat Publishers; and J. Dietzgen's Die Religion der 
Sozial-Demokratie, which was published between August 1870 and August 1871 
in Der Volksstaat, and in 1871 appeared as a pamphlet.—178 
254 An allusion to the preliminary conference held in London on 25-29 September 
1865 instead of the congress of the International Working Men's Association 
planned for Brussels. 
In line with a resolution of the Basle Congress (1869), the next congress of 
the International Working Men's Association was to be held in Paris. However, 
the persecution of the International's sections by the police in France compelled 
the General Council to move the next congress to Mainz (see Note 40). The 
outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War made the congress impossible; nor was it 
possible to hold it in the atmosphere of severe reprisals against the members of 
the International during the civil war in France, especially after the suppression 
of the Paris Commune. In these circumstances, the majority of national 
federations agreed that the congress be postponed and the General Council be 
empowered to fix the date of its convocation. At the same time the urgent tasks 
to be undertaken in the struggle against the Bakuninists and other sectarian 
elements, as well as other pressing problems, demanded the adoption of 
collective decisions. At its meeting on 25 July 1871 the General Council, at 
Engels' suggestion, resolved to convene a private conference of the Internation­
al in London on the third Sunday of September. The majority of the 
federations agreed to the proposal. 
The London Conference was held from 17 to 23 September 1871. 
Twenty-two voting, and ten non-voting, delegates took part in its work. The 
countries unable to send delegates were represented by the corresponding 
secretaries. Marx represented Germany, Engels —Italy. In all, nine sessions 
were held. The most important decision of the Conference was formula-

ted in Resolution IX, 'Political Action of the Working Class', which declared the 
need to found, in each country, an independent proletarian party whose ultimate 
goal was the conquest of political power by the working class.—178, 187, 308, 326, 
346, 563 
255 At the meeting of the General Council on 25 July 1871 the Bakuninist Robin, 
Guillaume's associate, raised the question about relations between the Bakuninist 
Alliance (see Note 10) and the International in connection with a speech made in 
Geneva by Utin, representative of the Russian Section of the International 
Working Men's Association, declaring that the Alliance had never been 
admitted into the International. 
In its resolutions of 22 December 1868 and 9 March 1869 (see present 
edition, Vol. 21, pp. 34-36, 45-46), the General Council did refuse to admit the 
Alliance as an international organisation; should the Alliance dissolve  itself, 
however, its separate groups were to be allowed to affiliate to the International 
Association as sections. Following the Alliance's declaration that it had dissolved 
itself,  the General Council admitted into the International the Geneva Section, 
which called itself the Alliance of Socialist Democracy. During the discussion of 
this question at its meeting of 25 July 1871, the General Council confirmed 
that the Geneva Section of the Alliance had been admitted into the 
International. However, at Marx's and Engels' suggestion the General Council 
resolved to examine at the forthcoming conference the question of whether the 
leaders of the Alliance complied with the terms on which its sections had been 
admitted into the International; any violation of those terms placed the 
organisations of the Alliance outside the International Working Men's 
Association.— 179 
256 Caporusso embezzled the 300 lire which had been collected by members of the 
Naples Section to assist their imprisoned comrades.—180 
257 The League of Peace and Freedom was a pacifist organisation set up in 1867 with 
the active participation of Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Garibaldi and other 
democrats. In 1867-68 Mikhail Bakunin was also among the members of the 
League. 
Marx's tactics vis-à-vis the League of Peace and Freedom were approved by 
the Brussels Congress of the International in 1868, which opposed official 
affiliation to the League but was in favour of joint action by the working 
class and all the progressive anti-war forces.—182 
258 The report on the General Council meeting of 25 July was published in The 
Eastern Post, No. 148, 29 July 1871.—185 
259 On Engels' advice, Cafiero published the subsequent part of the letter (up to 
the words: 'At last Tuesday's meeting the Council...') in Libero Pensiero on 
31 August 1871 and in several other Italian papers (see F. Engels, 'Mazzini's 
Statement Against the International Working Men's Association', present 
edition, Vol. 22).—185 
260 This refers to the withdrawal of the Italian Mazzinists from the Central 
(General) Council in April 1865 following the discussion of the conflict in the 
Paris Section of the International (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 82-83).—185 
261 This refers to Jung's letter to the editor of the bourgeois-democratic newspaper 
L'Echo de Verviers, in reply to the libellous attacks made on the International's 
leaders by the petty-bourgeois journalist Pierre Vésinier in the paper. Jung's

letter, dated 15 February 1866, had been edited by Marx (see present edition, 
Vol. 20, pp. 392-400).—186 
262 In Volume 2 of his Histoire de la révolution de 1848, Louis Blanc maintained that 
the Bonapartists had taken an active part in the events of June 1848 (see 
Note 113), which, he alleged, had been provoked by them.—-186 
263 Engels is quoting Resolution VIII on organisational questions adopted by the 
Basle Congress of the International (1869). By decision of the London Conference 
of 1871 this Resolution was incorporated into the new edition of the 
Administrative Regulations (I. The General Congress, Art. 7) (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, p. 8).—187 
264 Marx is referring to the planned publication of the proceedings of the third 
court martial, which was to try a group of Paris Communards (see Note 268). 
Owing to financial difficulties the proceedings were not published.—188, 
195 
265 This refers to the London Conference of the International Working Men's 
Association held between 17 and 23 September 1871 (see Note  254).—191, 
217, 220, 221, 259 
266 Engels has in mind the enquiry concerning Lopatin's fate which Marx made in 
his letter to Danielson dated 22 July 1871. In his reply to Marx on 31 July 
(12 August) Danielson wrote: 'The news about "our mutual friend" is correct. 
His position is extremely dangerous and may become chronic' (see Note 220).— 
192 
26' Engels sent to Lavrov two issues of The Eastern Post, namely No. 148 of 29 July 
1871,  which carried the report on the General Council meeting of 25 July with 
Engels' speech on Mazzini's attitude towards the International and No. 149 of 
5 August with the report on the General Council meeting of 1 August 
containing Marx's speech against Odger (see present edition, Vol. 22, 
pp. 607-08 and 610-11).—192 
268 This refers to the trial of 15 members of the Paris Commune and 2 members 
of the Central Committee of the National Guard which began on 7 August 
1871 in the Third Court Martial. Following the suppression of the Paris 
Commune there were altogether 26 courts martial in France. Judicial proceed­
ings continued until 1877. The number of people shot, sentenced to exile with 
hard labour or confined to prison amounted to 70,000.—193, 207, 209 
269 Paris was besieged by the Prussians in September 1870-January 1871 and by 
the Versailles Government troops in April-May 1871.—193 
270 Marx wrote this letter to Theodor Koll, treasurer of the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London (see Note 135), in connection with the slander 
campaign which the Lassallean elements in the Society were conducting against 
him. They alleged that Marx had embezzled money collected by the Society for the 
striking tailors in Pest. Early in August 1871 Marx temporarily withdrew from the 
Society. In December 1871 the Lassalleans were expelled.—194, 202 
271 On 1 May 1871 the tailors of 28 factories in Pest, Austria-Hungary, staged a 
strike, which later spread to other factories. The workers demanded hourly rates 
instead of piece rates, shorter working hours and a 20 per cent rise in wages. The 
strike was crushed by troops.—194

272 A reference to the bill of indictment against a group of the Paris Communards 
tried by the Third Court Martial (see Note 268). It was drawn up by public 
prosecutor Captain Gaveau (not long before that he had been a patient in a 
mental hospital, which he re-entered three months later and where he died). 
The bill of indictment was a collection of the most absurd slanderous 
inventions.—195 
273 In his letter to Bebel and Liebknecht of 4 December 1870 Lefaivre thanked 
them in the name of the French Republic for their speeches in the North 
German Reichstag on 26 November 1870 (see Note 134). The letter of thanks 
was published in the Börsenzeitung and reprinted in the Norddeutsche Allgemeine 
Zeitung. Der Volksstaat published it in No. 101, 17 December 1870.—196 
274 Following the arrest of Bebel, Liebknecht and Hepner (17 December 1870), 
Bismarck's government started preparations for a trial of the leaders of the 
Social-Democratic Workers' Party, who were charged with 'high treason' (see 
Note 134). The trial was held in Leipzig between 11 and 26 March 1872. 
Though the charges brought against them had not been proved, Bebel and 
Liebknecht were condemned to two-year imprisonment in a fortress (with the 
deduction of the two months they had spent in prison before the trial); Hepner 
was acquitted. Following the trial in Leipzig, early in July 1872 Bebel was again 
brought before the court 'for insulting His Majesty', which he had allegedly 
done when addressing workers in Leipzig. Bebel was sentenced to additional 
9 months in prison and deprived of his seat in the Reichstag.—196, 360, 365, 
458,  493, 510 
275 The Russian revolutionary Yelizaveta Dmitrieva (Tomanovskaya) took an active 
part in the Paris Commune and helped Marx and the General Council in 
maintaining contacts with the French members of the International during the 
Commune and after its suppression. Marx's letter to Dmitrieva has not 
survived.—198 
276 In August 1871, at the trial of a group of Communards, François Jourde, 
delegate of the Finance Commission of the Commune, was accused, among 
other things, of having set fire to the Ministry of Finance building.This charge 
was based on evidence fabricated by the police.—199 
277 On 9 August 1871 Der Volksstaat published a statement by Amand Goegg 
addressed to the editors of the Schwäbischer Merkur, in which he declared 
himself an advocate of individualism. On 12 August Der Volksstaat published 
Bernhard Becker's letter headed 'Zur Geschichte des Preußischen Re­
gierungssozialismus' referring to the time of his expulsion from the General 
Association of German Workers (1865).—199, 215 
278 Between 16 and 29 August 1871 Marx stayed at Brighton where, on his 
doctor's advice, he received treatment for overstrain.—  200,  201, 204, 206, 209 
279 On 19 August 1871 the newspaper Public Opinion (apparently Engels had a co­
py of this issue already on 18 August) published, under the title 'A German View 
of the International', an account of the leader 'Die Internationale' from the 
National-Zeitung, No. 351, 30 July 1871. On August 26 the Editor of Public 
Opinion published Marx's protest against the libels contained in the account (see 
present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 393-94) as well as an apology, as demanded by 
Marx.—200, 201, 204

280 In 1869 Nechayev established contacts with Bakunin and began setting up 
a secret organisation called Narodnaya Rasprava (The People's Judgment) in a 
number of Russian cities. Having received from Bakunin the credentials of the 
'Alliance révolutionnaire européenne', Nechayev passed himself off as a 
representative of the International. When members of Nechayev's organisation 
were arrested and put on trial in St Petersburg in the summer of 1871, the 
adventurist methods he had used—blackmail, intimidation, deception, etc.—were 
brought out into the open. The bourgeois press used the Nechayev case to 
discredit the International. 
On 22 September 1871 the London Conference charged the General 
Council to declare publicly that the International Working Men's Association 
had nothing to do with Nechayev's activities. On October 16 the General 
Council adopted an appropriate resolution drafted by Marx (see present 
edition, Vol. 23, p.  23).—201,  311, 436 
281 Early in August 1871 Lafargue had to flee to Spain in order to escape 
persecution by the Versailles Government. On 11 August he was arrested in 
Huesca on the orders of the Thiers government, but released 10 days 
later.—202, 204, 570 
282 The Appeal to members of the American sections of the International to 
raise money for the Paris Commune refugees was written by Marx and sent 
to Sorge, as can be seen from Marx's letter to Sorge of 5 September 
(see this volume, p. 211). The text of the Appeal has not been found.—203, 
204, 208, 211 
283 The text of Marx's telegram is not known.— 204 
284 xhis letter was published in English for the first time in: K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, International Publishers, New York, 
1953.—204, 236, 241 
285 A strike by dressers started on 11 June 1871 at clothing factories in St Gallen 
(Switzerland). Eight hundred strikers who had resolved at their meeting to 
join the International were sacked. The support of the Swiss sections of the 
International enabled the strikers to hold out until September, secure 
reinstatement for the sacked workers, and win a reduction of the working day 
by one hour.— 205 
288 On 3 August 1871 The New-York Herald published a report from its London 
correspondent about his meeting with Marx on 20 July 1871. The author 
distorted the content of their talk. Le Gaulois published excerpts from this 
report and Marx sent its editor a copy of the relevant statement which he had 
sent to The New-York  Herald.  Marx's statement was published in Le Gaulois, 
No. 1145, 27 August 1871 (see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 395); it did not 
appear in the Herald.—205 
287 This letter was published in English, in full, for the first time in: The Letters of 
Karl Marx, selected and translated with explanatory notes and an introduc­
tion by Saul K. Padover, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 
1979.—206 
288 The letter from the Russian revolutionary A. Davydov of 21 August 1871 
was prompted by a request Engels had made to him on 15 August for 
assistance to Paris Commune refugees. A cheque for £4 was enclosed with 
Davydov's reply. The text of Engels' letter to Davydov is not extant. 
Marx wrote 'Davyson' instead of Davydov.— 206

289 Of this letter only an excerpt cited in the article 'Pecuniary Position of the 
International' has been preserved. The article was published in The  World, 
No. 3687, 21 September 1871.—208 
290 Marx drafted this letter on the back of a letter from M. D. Conway, an 
American radical writer staying in Britain at the time. Conway enquired about 
the possibility of attending the General Council's forthcoming meetings. 
This letter was published in English for the first time in: K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, International Publishers, New York, 
1953.—209 
291 The reference is to the report of the International Working Men's Association's 
Central Committee for North America on the situation in the country and the 
activities of the International's organisations; it was sent to the London 
Conference of 1871.—211 
292 In his letter of 30 August 1871 Collet asked Marx where he could get 
Volume I of Capital, or excerpts from it in English, French or Italian, for the 
purpose of comparing them with the addresses issued by the International, 
which, as he put it, alarmed him.— 211 
293 Engels wrote a review of Volume I of Capital for The Fortnightly Review in 
May-June 1868, but it was rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, 
Vol. 20).—212 
294 Taking advantage of Engels' short holiday in Ramsgate (somewhere between 3 
and 9 September 1871) Marx asked him to talk with the British democrat Thomas 
Allsop about assistance to the Paris Commune refugees.—213 
295 In his letter to Marx of 7 September 1871 Allsop proposed that they meet on 
12 September to discuss the question of assistance to the Paris Commune 
refugees; he also asked Marx to make a list of those who were in particular 
need.—213 
296 The reference is to the London newspaper reports on the court proceedings 
instituted by Favre against Laluyé in March 1871. Favre charged Laluyé, a 
former Commander-in-Chief of the Paris National Guard, with slander. 
The newspapers, which reported the case, notably The Times, kept changing 
their stance, supporting now Favre now Laluye'.— 213 
297 On 2 September 1871 The Evening Standard reproduced a slanderous article 
about Marx previously published by the London Public Opinion (see Note 279). 
Marx sent a letter to The Evening Standard enclosing a copy of his statement to 
the Public Opinion for publication. The statement was not published on the 
pretext that it had not been found in the envelope.— 213 
298 This is a draft of Engels' answer to an enquiry from this firm about 
MacDonnel who had applied to it for a loan to start a printshop.—214 
299 Liebknecht offered Engels a mandate to attend the International's 1871 
London Conference (see Note 265). Engels was to represent the Saxonian 
members of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party. See also this volume, 
p. 232.—215, 288 
300 Liebknecht and his wife decided to name their son, born on 13 August 1871, 
Karl Friedrich Paul, in honour of Marx, Engels and Paul  Stumf,  Liebknecht's 
associate. This was the reason why Liebknecht enquired about Marx's and Engels' 
full names.—215

301 The London Trades Council was elected at a conference of trade union 
delegates in 1860. The Council headed the London trade unions, numbering 
many thousand members, and was fairly influential among the British workers. 
On 14 January 1867 the London Council resolved to co-operate with the 
International Association 'for the furtherance of all questions affecting the 
interests of labour; at the same time continuing the London Trades Council as 
a distinct and independent body as before'.— 215 
302 Referring to Engels' doubts about the wisdom of inviting Bernhard Becker to 
contribute to Der Volksstaat (see this volume, p. 199), Liebknecht wrote on 
8 September 1871 that the editorial board 'needed men of ability', but that they 
intended to keep him 'on a string'.—  216,  233 
303 xhe reference is to B. Becker, Enthüllungen über das  tragische  Lebensende Ferdinand 
Lassalle's, Schleiz, 1868. Engels gave his assessment of this work in the article 'On 
the Dissolution of the Lassallean Workers' Association (Postscript)' (see present 
edition, Vol. 21, p. 24).—216 
304 On 9 September 1871 Der Volksstaat, No. 73, published an announcement, 'Zur 
Notiz', informing the readers that the paper, 'by agreement with the General 
Council, ... would be publishing an authentic history of the Paris Commune'.— 
216 
305 In the summer of 1871, Bismarck and the Chancellor of Austria-Hungary 
Beust took coordinated steps to curb the working-class movement. The 
German and Austrian emperors specially discussed joint measures against the 
International at their meetings in Bad Gastein in August, and in Salzburg in 
September 1871. 
The Italian government joined the general crusade against the International 
by breaking up the Naples Section in August 1871, and persecuting members 
of the International, Theodor Cuno among others (see present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 151-52).—216 
306 Verona was the venue of the last congress of the Holy Alliance, held in 
October-December 1822. The congress adopted a resolution on the French 
intervention in Spain, which led to the restoration of the absolutist regime there 
in 1823. 
In Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary), the conference of German states' ministers in 
August 1819 resolved to introduce precensorship in all German states, establish 
strict surveillance over the universities, prohibit student societies and set up a 
central committee of inquiry for prosecuting persons suspected of opposition. 
In the 1820s the Austrian authorities instituted reprisals against the carbonari, 
members of secret political societies advocating unification, independence and 
liberal constitutional reforms for Italy.— 216 
307 Engels was on another holiday in Ramsgate (see Note 294) around 13-15 
September 1871.—216, 229 
308 This is Marx's reply to Sorge's letter of 8 August 1871. Sorge had informed Marx 
of the growing conflict in the International's Central Committee for North 
America with bourgeois reformists who were seeking to establish their influence 
over the organisations of the International. 
This letter was first published in English in: K. Marx and F. Engels, Letters 
to Americans. 1848-1895, International Publishers, New York,  1953.—  217

309 -j-jje London Conference adopted a decision to put out a new authentic edition 
of the International's Rules and Administrative Regulations in English, French 
and German (see present edition, Vol.  23, pp. 3-20). This edition appeared in 
English as a pamphlet published in London in November 1871. The French 
edition appeared in December 1871. The official German edition appeared in 
Der Volksstaat on 10 February 1872, and as a separate publication in Leipzig in 
1872.—217, 221, 236, 270, 282, 305 
310 The International's Central Committee for North America proposed that all 
sections submit to the Committee lists of their members with addresses and 
occupations. Washington's Section No. 23 responded by declaring that it 
preferred to maintain direct contact with the International's General Council 
residing in London rather than with the Central Committee.—  217,  236, 257 
3,1 On receiving a false report of Marx's death, the conference of the 
Cosmopolitan Society adopted a resolution saying that Marx was 'one of the 
most devoted, most fearless and most selfless defenders of all oppressed classes 
and peoples'. 
The Cosmopolitan Society was one of the many democratic organisations 
formed in the United States in the early 1870s. It consisted of petty-bourgeois 
elements and workers, and also included members of the International's sections. 
The society disbanded in early 1872.—220 
312 The reference is to Danielson's letter to Eleanor Marx of 31 August 
(12 September) 1871 in which he asked whether Russian newspaper reports 
about Marx's serious illness were true.— 220 
313 When the Swiss conflict (see Note 9) was discussed at the 1871 London 
Conference, Utin, Perret and Serraillier exposed the splitting activities of the 
Bakuninists Robin and Bastelica.— 220 
314 Jenny Marx's letter to the American newspaper Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly 
about the police persecution she and her sister Eleanor had been subjected to in 
France in the summer of 1871 (see Note 212) was sent by Marx and published on 
21 October 1871 together with his covering letter (see present edition, Vol. 22, 
p. 432).—220 
315 This letter is printed according to a handwritten copy now in the Berlin 
police archives. 
It was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx, On the First 
International. Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new translations by 
Saul K. Padover. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1973.—221 
316 Lavrov's letter of 29 September and this one by Engels refer to a consignment 
of books for Lavrov (see this volume, p. 218) and also discuss in a coded form 
the organisation of assistance to the French refugees.—222, 562 
317 Marx, his wife Jenny and Engels went on holiday to Ramsgate from 
28 September to 3 October 1871.—222, 562 
318 This probably refers to certain French refugees and the Society of Commune 
Refugees (see this volume, p. 274).—223 
319 In his letter of 8 October 1871 Perret asked Marx to send urgently the London 
Conference resolution relating to the split in Romance Switzerland (see present 
edition, Vol. 22, pp. 419-22).—223

820 A reference to the £42 collected by German Section No. 1 in the USA by 
subscription for the Paris Commune refugees. The money was later sent to the 
General Council to be distributed among the refugees. A deputation from the 
Society of Commune Refugees in London (see Note 378) attended the meeting 
of the General Council on 29 August 1871 to demand an account of how the 
émigré fund was being distributed. A resolution proposed by Engels was 
adopted, recognising the donors as the only persons with the right to monitor 
the actions of the General Council in this respect. At the Council's meeting of 
16 October 1871 Marx insisted that the money should be distributed by the 
General Council to those Commune refugees who were hardest hit.— 224 
321 Marx's letter to Hales was written on a General Council form together with the 
text of the resolution on Nechayev (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 23). British 
newspapers did not publish the Nechayev resolution.— 225 
322 In response to Marx's enquiry, Utin wrote on 28 October 1871 that the 
Bakuninists were attempting to set up in Zurich a Slav section consisting of 
Bulgarian and Serbian students and to counterpose it to the Russian Section of the 
International. The group, which took the name of 'Slavenski Zaves', affiliated to 
the Alliance of Socialist Democracy. After the General Council refused to 
recognise it as a section of the International in the spring of 1872, it became 
part of the Jura Federation. The group ceased to exist in the summer of 
1873.—227 
323 The reference is to the 1871 London Conference resolutions (see present 
edition, Vol. 22, pp. 423-31). The General Council asked Marx to prepare 
them for publication in English, French and German.— 227, 231, 257 
324 The Tugendbund ('Union of Virtue') was one of the patriotic societies founded 
in Prussia in 1808 following the defeat by Napoleonic France. It united 
representatives of the liberal nobility and the bourgeois intelligentsia. The 
society advocated moderate liberal reforms and sought to rally support for the 
idea of an anti-Napoleonic liberation war.—228 
325 At the sitting of the London Conference on 20 September 1871 Vaillant tabled 
a draft resolution stressing the need for political action by the working class. In 
the course of the discussion of this resolution and Serraillier's and Frankel's 
addenda to it Marx and Engels made speeches which provided the basis for 
the resolution 'Political Action of the Working Class' (IX). To draw up the 
resolution a special commission of the General Council was set up which 
included Engels, Martin and Le Moussu. The resolution was then discussed at 
the General Council's meeting of 16 October. Marx was asked to prepare it for 
the press.—231, 331 
326 On 12 September 1871 Liebknecht sent Engels a mandate to attend the 
London Conference as a representative of the Saxonian members of the 
Social-Democratic Workers' Party.— 232, 571 
327 On 27 October 1871 The Times published an unsigned article 'The 
International Working Men's Association'. It described the origins of the 
International since 1848. Its closing lines stated that the Association's aim 
remained as it was at its foundation, 'the complete emancipation of the working 
class'.—233 
328 The reference is to a number of sections organised by Bakuninists in the Swiss 
Jura. Relying on these sections, the Bakuninists managed to obtain a formal 
majority at the Romance Federation Congress held in La Chaux-de-Fonds on

4-6 April 1870. The Bakuninists attempted to seize leadership of the whole 
federation, which caused a split (see Note 9). 
This conflict was discussed at the 1871 London Conference, and was 
resolved in favour of the genuine Romance Federal Committee. It was 
suggested that the Bakuninist Council should call itself the Council of the Jura 
Federation (see K. Marx, 'Resolution of the London Conference relating to the 
Split in Romance Switzerland', present edition, Vol. 22,pp. 419-22).— 234

330 The 1871 London Conference, on Marx's initiative, instructed the General 
Council to establish a Federal Council for England. The General Council itself 
had acted as such from the International's foundation to the autumn of 1871. 
In October 1871 a provisional London Federal Council was formed from 
representatives of the International's London Section and some of the trade 
unions. From the outset it was dominated by a group of reformists headed by 
John Hales, Secretary of the General Council. They attempted to set the 
Federal Council against the General Council. Following the Hague Congress of 
1872 the left wing of the Federal Council, supported by Marx and Engels, 
constituted itself the British Federal Council.—234, 302, 382 
331 Eccarius was appointed the General Council's Corresponding Secretary for the 
USA (French sections excluded) at the Council's meeting of 2 October 
1871.—236, 382 
332 Section No. 12 joined the American sections of the International in July 1871. 
Its leaders, the feminists Victoria Woodhull and Tennessee Claflin, began 
campaigning for bourgeois reforms on behalf of the International. On 
27 September 1871, without the knowledge of the New York Central 
Committee, Section No. 12 demanded that the General Council recognise it as 
the leading body of the International in the USA. Simultaneously it 
campaigned in the press against the sections which upheld the proletarian 
character of the International. 
In its resolution of 5 November 1871 the General Council rejected the 
claims of Section No. 12 and confirmed the powers of the New York Central 
Committee. Nevertheless Section No. 12 continued to act in the same vein, 
which led to a split between the proletarian and petty-bourgeois sections. In 
March 1872 the General Council expelled Section No. 12 from the International, 
and in September 1872 this decision was confirmed by the Hague Congress.—

the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party took place in the Brunswick 
district court in November 1871. (On their arrest see Note 115.) The main 
point of the indictment was their membership of the International. The court 
found Bracke and Bonhorst guilty of 'infringing public order' and sentenced 
them to 16 months in prison. In February 1872, however, the court of appeal 
quashed the sentence as groundless and cut the term of imprisonment from 16 
to 3 months, also deducting the period of preliminary detention; this virtually 
amounted to an acquittal.—237, 242, 360 
336 A short excerpt from this letter was published in English for the first time in: 
Marx, Engels, On Literature and Art, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1976; part 
of this letter appeared in: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Letters on 'Capital', 
New Park Publications, London, 1983.—238 
337 Marx gives the pages and numbers of footnotes according to the first German 
edition of Volume I of Capital which came out in 1867. Marx inserted all 
the amendments and printing corrections enumerated in the appendix, 
together with some minor editorial changes, in the second German edition of 
Volume I which appeared in 1872-73. They were also included in all 
subsequent editions. (Volume 35 of the present edition reproduces the text 
according to the 1887 English edition of Capital, edited by Engels.) Throughout 
this letter the page numbers in brackets refer to the corresponding pages 
of the paperback English edition of Capital, Volume I, Lawrence & Wishart, 
London, 1967, from which the passages cited have been taken (where 
relevant).—238 
338 The French Section of 1871 was formed in London in September of that year by 
French refugees. The leaders of the Section established close contacts with 
Bakuninists in Switzerland. The Rules of the French Section of 1871, published 
in Qui Vivel, its official newspaper, were submitted to the General Council at 
its extraordinary meeting on 16 October 1871 and referred to a special 
commission (see Note 341). At the General Council meeting of 17 October 
Marx tabled a resolution on behalf of the commission (present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 24-27), recommending that the Section bring several paragraphs of its 
Rules into line with the Rules of the International. In its letter of 31 October 
signed by Augustin Avrial, the Section rejected the General Council resolution. 
This reply was discussed in the commission and at the General Council meeting 
of 7 November 1871. Auguste Serraillier, Corresponding Secretary for France, 
submitted a resolution written by Marx, which was adopted unanimously by the 
Council (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 37-42). In December 1871 the French 
Section of 1871 split up into a number of groups. In some of his letters Marx 
called this section French Section No. 2 to distinguish it from the French Section 
in London, established in 1865 (see Note  50).—241,  256, 267, 278, 280, 302, 309, 
315, 331, 568 
339 fhe reference is to a group of French refugees, participants in the Paris 
Commune, who allied themselves with the Bakuninists in Switzerland (Aristide 
Claris, Benoît Malon, Jules Guesde, André Léo, and others). On 6 September 
1871 they set up a section of propaganda and revolutionary socialist action 
together with members of the Geneva Section of the Alliance de la démocratie 
socialiste (Nikolai Zhukovsky, Charles Perron) which had dissolved on the eve 
of the London Conference. The General Council, proceeding from the London 
Conference decisions prohibiting the admission of sectarian groups, refused to 
admit the section. This was confirmed by the Hague Congress in September 
1872.—241,  268, 315

S40 At the morning sitting on 22 September 1871 the London Conference 
discussed the Belgian delegates' proposal, tabled by De Paepe, to limit the 
number of representatives from each nationality in the General Council. Marx 
opposed De Paepe. The Conference confirmed as members of the General 
Council all the previously admitted Communards.—241 
341 After the 1871 London Conference, the Rules of the International's local 
organisations were subject to approval by the General Council. They were 
first discussed by the Council's committee which had been appointed on 
6 October 1871 to prepare a new edition of the General Rules and 
Administrative Regulations, and included Marx, Jung and Serraillier.— 
242 
342 On 1 November 1871 Kugelmann sent Marx the indictment handed down by the 
Brunswick court (see Note 335). Marx compares it to the Vienna court judgment 
of 26 July 1870 which charged the Austrian Social-Democrats Heinrich 
Oberwinder, J. Most and Andreas Scheu with high treason. They were sentenced 
to several years' imprisonment with a strict regime and one day a month without 
food.—243 
343 xhe reference is to the followers of James O'Brien. On a number of questions, 
such as nationalisation of the land and the Irish question, they supported Marx 
in the International. Some other points of their programme were of a Utopian 
character, viz: 'a just and direct exchange' of the products of labour at their 
cost-price through the establishment of public warehouses and the introduction 
of symbolic labour money.—  244,  252 
344 Prior to the establishment in December 1870 of the International's Central 
Committee for North America, the General Council maintained contact with 
the International's sections in the USA through its local permanent correspon­
dents,  who received their plenary powers from the General Council. The 
General Council approved the appointment of Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt 
on 29 September and 13 October 1868, and Marx sent their credentials to the 
USA on 28 October 1868 (see present edition, Vol. 43, pp. 148-49).—244 
345 This letter marks the beginning of Engels' correspondence with Theodor Cuno, 
a member of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party, who organised a 
section of the International in Milan. On 1 November 1871,soon after he had 
arrived in Milan and begun working as an engineer at the large Elvetica plant, 
Cuno wrote to Engels, the General Council's Corresponding Secretary for Italy, 
requesting assistance in making contact with members of the International in 
Milan and Italy at large. 
Part of the letter was published in English for the first time in: K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895. A Selection, International Publishers, 
New York, 1953.—245 
346 Engels established contact with the Gazzettino Rosa through Cafiero in July-August 
1871;  in the next few months the newspaper published several General Council 
documents.—245 
347 The reference is to Giuseppe Garibaldi's letter to Giuseppe Petroni, editor of 
La Roma del Popolo, of 21 October 1871. In it, Garibaldi declared his 
disagreement with Mazzini's attacks on the Paris Commune and the Interna­
tional. This letter was published in many Italian newspapers. On 7 November 
1871 Engels reported the content of the letter to the General Council. Engels

translated it and included it almost in full in the report of the Council's 
sitting. The report was published in The Eastern Post on 11 November 
1871.—245 
348 Marx sent Jung a letter from Mainier, Secretary of the Eastern Paris Section, 
who requested the General Council on 15 November 1871 to support the Paris 
jewellers, who intended to go on strike for a shorter working day. Marx's letter to 
Mainier has not been found. Its content is known from Mainier's reply of 
27 November, in which he thanked Marx for his promise of assistance and 
informed him that no strike had taken place.—246 
349 The reference is to the collection of funds for the Paris Commune refugees; in 
this connection the General Council appealed, in particular, to the British 
Radicals, notably to Charles Dilke, M.P.— 249 
350 The reference is to the nomination of Frederick Cournet, an active 
Communard, to the General Council. He was coopted at the meeting of 
21 November 1871.—249 
351 In his letter of 19 November 1871 Adolphe Hubert informed Marx of the 
forthcoming changes in the editorial board of Qui Vive!. He suggested that 
French members of the International and Paris Commune refugees close to 
Marx be brought onto the board.—  250,  281 
352 This letter was published in English for the first time in part in: The 
International Socialist Review, Chicago, 1911; and in full in: K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Letters to Americans. 1848-1895, International Publishers, New York, 
1953.—251 
353 The reference is to the Report for October 1871 of the North American 
Central Committee of the International to the General Council, signed by 
Sorge and dated 5 November  1871.—  251 
354 A reference to German Section No. 1 in New York, which was the oldest section 
of the International in the USA, and originated from a Communist Club 
set up in 1857 by German revolutionary émigrés. The nucleus of this 
club consisted of former members of the Communist League and Marx's 
associates. Its members played a leading role in the New York General 
Association of German Workers, which propagated Marxism. In December 
1869 the General Association of German Workers affiliated to the International 
and took the name of Section No. 1. The Section engaged in an active struggle 
against bourgeois reformers.—  251,  334 
355 Mutualists—this is what the Right-wing Proudhonists called themselves in the 
1860s when they were members of the French sections of the International. 
These sections advocated a scheme for working people's emancipation 
through organised mutual assistance, i.e., the formation of cooperatives, mutual 
aid societies, etc.— 255 
356 The reference is to the resolutions of the 1871 London Conference: 'Designation 
of National Councils, etc' (Resolution II, Points 1, 2, 3), 'Political Action of the 
Working Class' (Resolution IX), 'The Alliance of Socialist Democracy' (Resol­
ution XVI) and 'Split in the French-speaking part of Switzerland' (Resolution 
XVII) (see present edition, Vol. 22).—255, 270 
337 Marx is referring to André Léo's speech at the 1871 Peace Congress in 
Lausanne. Léo called Ferré and Rigault sinister figures of the Commune.—

358 On 16 November 1871 No. 39 of Qui Vive! carried a letter written, on behalf of 
the General Council by Serraillier, Corresponding Secretary for France, dated 
11 November. Addressed to Vermersch, Editor of Qui Vive!, the letter stated that 
the General Council accepted no responsibility for the publication in the said 
newspaper of the London Conference resolutions, taken from some unofficial 
source. Serraillier drew attention, in particular, to the distortion of Point 2, 
Resolution XIII, which said that 'German working men have done their duty 
during the Franco-German war' (see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 428). 
In reply to Serraillier's letter, fifteen members of the French Section of 
1871 published a 'Protestation' in No. 42 of Qui Vive!, 19-20 November 
1871.—256 
359 The reference is to the French-Language Section in London, formed in November 
1871 by the proletarian elements from among the Paris Commune refugees. 
On 18 November 1871 the Section adopted its Rules, which were approved by 
the General Council in February 1872. The French-Language Section in 
London included Marguerittes, Le Moussu, De Wolf  fers, etc., and supported 
the General Council in its campaign against the petty-bourgeois stand adopted 
by some of the French refugees (Vermersch, etc.).— 256, 269, 280, 302 
360 The Russian edition of Volume I of Capital was published at the end of 
March 1872; the edition of 3,000 copies was rather large for that time. It was 
sold very quickly, contrary to the Tsarist censors' expectations; they considered 
Capital to be a work 'difficult to understand', and that was the reason they 
allowed its publication (see also Note 146).—256, 283, 362, 377, 385, 396, 399, 
438,  576, 582 
361 The case of Gustave Durand, who tricked his way into the International as a 
leader of the French Section of 1871 and then was discovered to be a police 
agent, was considered at the special meeting of the General Council on 
7 October 1871. Durand's correspondence with police officers was brought 
before the Council. The resolution on Durand's expulsion was drawn up and 
submitted to the General Council meeting by Engels (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, p. 21).—257, 267 
S62 The reference is to the letter to Serraillier of 13 November 1871 written on 
behalf of the International's sections in Béziers and Pézenas. The authors 
denounced Bousquet as a police agent and demanded his expulsion from the 
International.—257, 270 
363 Engels meant 'Relazione sulla Sezione Napoletana dell'Associazione Inter-
nazionale dei Lavoratori'. This document, written in November 1871 by 
Carmelo Palladino, described the state of the workers' movement in Naples 
and the background and activities of the International's Naples Section. Some 
material from 'Relazione' was used by Marx and Engels in their work The 
Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association (see 
present edition, Vol. 23).—259 
364 On 20 August 1871 the Naples Section was broken up by the police.—260 
365 On the London Conference of 1865, see Note 254. 
Engels probably has in mind the fact that the 1866 Geneva Congress of the 
International approved the agenda proposed by the London Conference of 
1865 and worked out by the Central (General) Council.—260

367 xhe reference is to a commission set up by the London Conference to consider 
the Swiss conflict (see Note 9). It included Marx, Vaillant, Verrycken, 
MacDonnel and Eccarius; Engels also took part in the commission's work. The 
meeting mentioned by Marx was held on 18 September 1871. Marx reported 
on the commission's findings at the sitting of 21 September 1871, which 
unanimously adopted the resolution tabled by him (see present edition, 
Vol. 22, pp. 419-22). 
The question of Robin's expulsion from the General Council for his attempt 
to disrupt the work of the commission was considered at several Council meetings. 
On 17 October 1871 Robin was expelled.—266, 563 
368 An allusion to the custom of the ancient Parthians of shooting at an enemy 
from horseback with the horse turned away as if in flight. Hence the 
expression 'a Parthian shot', which means a parting shot or, in modern 
parlance, the last word in an argument.—266 
369 Marx had in mind an episode from Book Four of Rabelais' Gargantua and 
Pantagruel in which Panurge, having quarrelled with a sheep trader travelling 
on the same ship, bought a ram called Robin (the traditional name for a 
ram in France) from the trader and threw it overboard, and the whole flock 
followed.—267 
370 Revenons à nos moutons (let's return to our sheep)—an expression from a 
medieval French farce which means 'let us return to our starting point, the 
subject of our conversation'.—267

Qui Vive!, No. 42, 19-20 November 1871 (see Note 358).—268 
372 xhe reference is to Raul Rigault's article 'Les agents secrets', published in La 
Patrie en danger, No. 62, 11 November 1870. It said that Chouteau had been 
used by a police provocateur for the purpose of setting up a secret workers' 
society.—268 
373 Marx is referring to Sicard's letter to Vermersch of 22 November published in 
Qui Vive!, No. 46, 24 November 1871.—269 
374 The Congress of the Bakuninist Jura Federation held in Sonvillier on 12 
November 1871 adopted the Sonvillier circular, 'Circulaire à toutes les 
fédérations de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs'. It was directed 
against the General Council and the 1871 London Conference, and countered 
the Conference decisions with anarchist phrases about the sections' political 
indifferentism and complete autonomy. The Bakuninists proposed that all the 
federations demand the immediate convocation of a congress to revise the 
General Rules and to condemn the General Council's actions. 
The International's sections in Germany, Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, 
the USA, and also the Section in Milan, came out against the circular. Engels 
gave the Bakuninists a vigorous rebuff in his article 'The Congress of Sonvillier 
and the International' (present edition, Vol. 23).—270, 289, 292, 299, 310, 318,

376 Marx's letters to Balaszewicz-Potocki of 25 and 29 November 1871 were found in 
the archives of the Third Department (political police in Tsarist Russia). Juliusz 
Balaszewicz was an agent of the Russian secret police in London, where he posed 
as Count A. Potocki, a Polish emigre. 
These letters were written in reply to Balaszewicz's letters offering his 
assistance in distributing the documents of the International among Poles and 
Russians. 
Marx's letters were written on letterheads of the General Council of the 
International Working Men's Association.—272, 273 
377 The letter was written on a letterhead of the General Council of the International 
Working Men's Association.—273 
378 The Society of Commune Refugees, formed in London in July 1871, attempted to 
gain control over the distribution of funds the General Council was collecting 
for the refugees. At the beginning of 1872 the society was transformed into a 
mutual aid society.—274 
379 Answering the letter from Sorge of 12 November 1871 which said that the 
Irish members of the Central Committee of the International for North 
America in New York were against electing MacDonnel Corresponding 
Secretary of the General Council for Ireland, Marx deemed it necessary to give 
a detailed explanation of the matter. 
MacDonnel had been elected Secretary on 1 August 1871. His activities 
resulted in the establishment of Irish sections of the International in a number of 
English towns in 1871-1872.—274

382 Mesa's letter to Lafargue of 28 November 1871 was forwarded by Lafargue to 
Marx on 3 December. Mesa wrote that the Spanish Federal Council regarded 
abstention from voting at elections as the only possible way for the proletariat 
to separate from the bourgeoisie and to form its own, independent party.—277 
383 A reference to the article 'La politica de la Internacional', published in La 
Emancipation, No. 24, 27 November 1871. In the article the editorial board 
approved the London Conference resolution 'Political Action of the Working 
Class',  but said that the policy of abstaining from political struggle was, for a 
time,  a necessary measure in Spain. The article was reproduced in La 
Federation on 3 December 1871 (No. 120), and, slighdy abridged, in L'Egalité, 
No. 24, 24 December 1871.—277, 282 
384 A reference to the 'Declaration Sent by the General Council to the Editors of 
Italian Newspapers Concerning Mazzini's Articles about the International'

set forth its principal propositions at the meeting of the General Council on 
5 March 1872. 
The circular was issued as a pamphlet in French at the end of May 1872; it 
was signed by all members of the General Council and sent to all federations of 
the International.—278, 284, 294, 393, 404, 407, 412, 415 
386 After the 1871 London Conference the Lassalleans in the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London began campaigning against the General Council. 
They acted jointly with the Bakuninists and the petty-bourgeois refugees 
from the French Section of 1871. Joseph Schneider's article 'An die 
Socialdemokraten Deutschlands' was published in No. 67 of the Neuer 
Social-Demokrat, 3 December 1871. In it he calumniated Marx, Bebel and the 
International, citing, in particular, the 'Protestation' of 15 members of the French 
Section of 1871 (see Note 358). 
The Neuer Social-Demokrat, Nos. 68 and 69, 6 and 8 December 1871, 
published contributions by 'a socialist living in London' which contained attacks 
on the International. They could have been written by E. J. Weber. 
In December 1871 the Lassalleans were expelled from the Society, and it 
declared its solidarity with the General Council and the decisions of the 
London Conference.—279, 297, 320 
387 A reference to 'Ein offenes Wort an Herrn W. Liebknecht' by Frankel, 
published in the Social-Demokrat, No. 105, 5 September 1869; in the first part 
of the letter Frankel expressed support for Schweitzer, and in the second 
part, he criticised Liebknecht's speech at a workers' meeting in Vienna on 25 
July 1869. The letter was reproduced in the Neuer Social-Demokrat, Nos. 66 and 
67, 1 and 3 December 1871. In his letter of 8 December 1871, Liebknecht 
asked Engels to persuade Frankel to protest publicly against the reprinting 
of the letter.—280 
388 On 10 December 1871 the Neuer Social-Demokrat, No. 70, carried an item 
which refuted the information published in the 'Politische Uebersicht' column of 
Der Volksstaat on 29 November 1871. Der Volksstaat had denied the assertion of 
the bourgeois press that Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, M.P., Radical, was an 
honorary member of the London Section of the International.—280 
389 The Neuer Social-Demokrat, No. 69, 8 December 1871 carried a report from 
Copenhagen in the Lassallean spirit. Liebknecht, therefore, asked Engels in his 
letter of 8 December to help him find a correspondent in Denmark for Der 
Volksstaat.— 280 
390 A reference to Karl Boruttau's letter which Liebknecht forwarded to Marx 
together with his own letter of 8 December  1871.—  281 
391 On 2 December 1871 the general meeting of the Geneva Federation of the 
International heard a report by Perret, its delegate to the London Conference, 
about the work of the Conference and the decisions it had adopted (see also 
Note  398).—281,  310 
392 In his letter of 8 December 1871 Liebknecht wrote; 'In last year's circular on 
Bakunin there is a reference to the subterranée ... of the I.W.M.A. You can 
prepare an explanation of this expression for our trial.' He had in mind the 
passage in the circular 'The General Council to the Federal Council of 
Romance Switzerland' where Marx pointed out that the General Council may 
achieve success with the English workers not through 'showman's chatter', but 
by 'serious and unostentatious work' (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 87).—282

395 Laura Lafargue, in her letter to Marx of 12 December 1871, and Paul 
Lafargue, in his letter to Engels of the same date, reported on the results of 
their preliminary negotiations with Maurice Lachâtre, a French publisher, 
concerning the publication of the French translation of Volume I of Capital (see 
also Note 147). Laura wrote that Lachâtre had stated that not more than 4,000 
francs would be needed to start work on the publication, of which the author had 
to pay one  half.  Lafargue had accepted these conditions and offered to pay the 
sum himself.—283, 298, 301, 314 
396 In his letter to Marx of 28 November 1871 Meissner wrote that almost the 
whole of the first German edition of Volume I of Capital, issued in 1867, 
had been sold out. He suggested that Marx should start preparing the second 
German edition (see Note 145).—283,298, 301, 314,327, 343,347, 374, 379, 396,

397 A reference to the 'Circulaire à toutes les fédérations de l'Association 
Internationale des Travailleurs' adopted at Sonvillier on 12 November 1871 
(see Note 374). It was printed in La Emancipation, the organ of the Spanish 
Federal Council, on 25 December 1871.—284 
398 The resolutions of Thirty Sections in Geneva were adopted at the meeting of the 
Geneva Sections of the International on 2 December 1871. They rejected the 
Bakuninist Sonvillier circular and expressed solidarity with and support for the 
General Council's activities and the London Conference resolutions. The 
resolutions of the thirty sections were published in L'Égalité, Nos. 23 and 
24, 7 and 24 December 1871. In addition, Engels sent to Lafargue the 'Réponse 
du Comité fédéral romand à la Circulaire des 16 signataires, membres du 
Congrès de Sonvilliers', published in L'Egalité, No. 24, 24 December 1871, 
which condemned the Bakuninists' splitting activities. All these documents were 
published by Lafargue in La Emancipation, Nos. 29 and 30, 1 and 7 January 
1872.—284, 568 
399 A reference to the 1869 Basle Congress Administrative Resolutions, 
which extended the rights of the General Council; Resolution V gave the 
Council the right to refuse admission to new sections; Resolution VI gave it the 
right to suspend individual sections until the next congress. These resolutions 
were incorporated into the International's Administrative Regulations after the 
1871 London Conference.—285, 289, 292, 296, 308, 313 
400 On 23 December 1871 the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 300, and on 28 
December, the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 302, printed a report on the 
1871 London Conference, including the texts of its resolutions. At Marx's 
request Eleanor Marx informed Liebknecht on 29 December (see this volume, 
p. 571) that the report was a falsification. On 30 December Der Volksstaat, 
No. 104, printed a statement in its 'Politische Uebersicht' column pointing out 
that the above-mentioned resolutions were falsified. 
Engels referred to it as the 'Stieberian escapade' after Wilhelm. Stieber, the

402 The Federal Diet (Bundestag), the central body of the German Confederation, 
was founded in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna. It consisted of representatives 
of the German states and met in Frankfurt am Main under the chairmanship 
of the Austrian delegate. Having neither an army nor financial means at its 
disposal the Diet did not have any real power; it ceased to exist in 1866.—288 
40S j)er  Volksstaat did not carry Engels' article on the subject.—289 
404 In its discussion of the Sonvillier circular (see Note 374), the congress of the 
Belgian Federation of the International Working Men's Association held on 24-25 
December 1871 in Brussels declined to back the demand of the Jura 
Federation that a General Congress of the International be convened without 
delay, yet at the same time instructed the Belgian Federal Council to draw up 
new draft Rules for the Association. Those behind the project were motivated 
by the desire to deprive the General Council of its powers. A short report on 
the congress was published in L'Internationale, No. 155, 31 December 1871, and 
also in Der Volksstaat, No. 5, 17 January 1872.—289, 296, 310, 374, 568, 574 
405 In his letters to Marx and Engels of 2, 9 and 29 December 1871 and 1 and 
4 January 1872, Maltman Barry proposed that a new secretary of the General 
Council be elected, since John Hales had been elected secretary of the British 
Federal Council (see Note 330).—291 
406 The Labour Representation League was founded in November 1869. It embraced 
trade union leaders who sought to have working-class candidates elected to the 
House of Commons by making a deal with the Liberals. The League ceased to 
exist around 1880.—291 
407 In a letter to Engels dated 4 December 1871 Carlo Terzaghi applied for 
financial assistance for II Proletario Italiano newspaper, of which he was 
publisher. Engels drafted a reply after 6 January 1872. However, before the 
letter was despatched Engels read in the Gazzettino Rosa of Terzaghi's support 
for the demand of the Bakuninist Jura Federation that a General Congress be 
convened without delay. Thus, on 14[-15] January Engels wrote another letter 
with only the first two paragraphs of the old draft left more or less intact. The 
remainder was written partly between the deleted lines of the first draft and 
partly on a clean sheet. Engels wrote in German across Terzaghi's letter: 
'Answered on 6 January 1872-14 January.' 
The second version of the letter was published in English for the first time 
in: Marx and Engels, Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing 
House, Moscow,  1955.—  291 
408 In December 1871 in the Turin Workers' Federation (Federazione operaia), set 
up in late September of that year, a split occurred between the supporters of the 
International (including the Bakuninists) and the Mazzinians. The Mazzinians' 
opponents left the Federation to form a society called the Emancipation of the 
Proletarian (La Emancipazione del Proletario), which declared itself a section of 
the International. It consisted of workers from the railway workshops, the 
machine-building works and the arsenal. The Bakuninist Carlo Terzaghi was 
elected secretary. Later he was dismissed from the position and exposed as a 
police agent.—292

411 A reference to the report of the Bakuninist committee to the Sonvillier 
congress of 5 October 1871. The committee, after the split in the Romance 
Federation in April 1870, continued illegitimately to call itself the Romance 
Federal Committee. The report cited facts about the anarchist sections 
supporting the Bakuninists (mostly in highland Jura).—293 
412 A reference to the statement carried by the Gazzettino Rosa, No. 360, 
28 December 1871, as part of the 'Movimento operajo' review that the

Terzaghi's influence, to support the Sonvillier circular of the Jura Federa­
tion.—294

Belgian Federation (see Note 404) by Die Tagwacht, No. 1, 6 January 1872 (in the 
'Belgien' column), and by La Emancipation, No. 30, 7 January 1872.—296 
414 On 5 January 1872 Liebknecht wrote to Engels asking when the next Congress 
of the International was to take place, and suggested Germany or a country 
bordering on it as its venue.—297 
415 On 7 January 1872 the Neuer Social-Demokrat, No. 3, printed a letter written by 
a number of Lassalleans. It was signed by Heinrich Schenck and Christian 
Winand, who had been expelled from the German Workers' Educational 
Society in London (see Note 135), and contained libellous attacks on Marx and 
the General Council. 
On 27 January 1872 Der Volksstaat, No. 8, carried a reply signed by 
A. Caulaincourt, secretary of the German Workers' Educational Society, under 
the heading 'Die Gegner der Internationalen Arbeiterassoziation'. Der Volks­
staat, No. 14 (17 February 1872), printed an article headed 'Wer ist Joseph 
Schneider?' criticising the Lassallean views expounded by Schneider in his 
article 'An die Socialdemokraten Deutschlands'. Directed against the Interna­
tional (see Note 386), it had appeared in the Neuer Social-Demokrat, No. 67, 
3 December 1871.—297, 320 
416 A reference to the editorial statement in the 'Sucesos de la semana' column 
published by La Emancipation, No. 31, 14 January 1872, which described the 
Neuer Social-Demokrat as a newspaper which had sold out to Bismarck. This 
piece was translated by Engels and published by Der Volksstaat, No. 10, 
3 February 1872.—297, 302 
417 In April 1872 the Universal Federalist Council was formed in London, 
comprising what was left of the French Section of 1871 (see Note 338), some of 
the Lassalleans expelled from the German Workers' Educational Society in 
London, and representatives of the bourgeois Universal Republican League 
and the Land and Labour League. The Council proclaimed itself a 'true' 
leading body of the International in a pamphlet called Conseil fédéraliste 
universel de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs et des Sociétés républicaines 
socialistes adhérentes. This prompted Marx to write the 'Declaration of the

General Council Concerning the Universal Federalist Council'. In September 
1872 the Universal Federalist Council convened a congress in London which 
claimed to be a congress of the International Working Men's Association. Its 
subsequent activities amounted to in-fighting between the various cliques which 
laid claim to leadership of the workers' movement.—297, 418, 424, 428, 
474 
418 The Congress of Saxonian Social-Democrats was held in Chemnitz on 
6-7 January 1872. It was attended by 120 delegates, among them Bebel and 
Liebknecht, representing nearly 60 local organisations. In closed session the 
congress considered its attitude to the Sonvillier circular (see Note 374) and the 
battle against the anarchists in the International. Having rejected the circular 
and approved the resolutions of the London Conference, the congress gave its 
unanimous support to the General Council.—298, 304, 310, 577 
419 Membership of the International could be either collective or individual. In 
countries where its activities were officially banned (Germany, for instance), the 
General Council issued membership cards to each new recruit individually. 
The Congress of Saxonian Social-Democrats (see Note 418) passed a 
resolution in favour of recruiting individual applicants to the International.— 
298, 318 
420 Resolution IV of the 1871 London Conference introduced penny stamps for 
the payment of membership dues. 'These stamps are to be affixed to a special 
sheet of the livret or to the Rules which every member is held to possess' (see 
present edition, Vol. 22, p. 424). Consequently, the General Council ceased to 
issue membership cards.—298, 306, 314, 315, 319, 332, 447 
421 Luigi Stefanoni, a bourgeois democrat and member of the Bakuninist Alliance 
of Socialist Democracy, presented himself in November 1871 as the initiator of 
the Universal Society of Rationalists (Società Universale dei Razionalisti) allegedly 
intended to put into practice the principles of the International but free of 'its 
negative features'. Stefanoni advanced as a social panacea the Utopian idea of 
buying land from the landlords and establishing agricultural colonies. The 
draft programme of the Society was printed by II Libero Pensiero, No. 18, 
2 November 1871. Later, Stefanoni published a number of slanderous articles 
directed against the General Council and Marx and Engels personally. Marx's 
and Engels' writings (e.g. Engels' letter to the editors of the Gazzettino Rosa, 
Marx's article 'Stefanoni and the International Again', present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 74-75, 160-63), which exposed Stefanoni's real ambitions, contributed to 
the failure of Stefanoni's attempts to subject the workers' movement in Italy to 
bourgeois influence.—298, 319 
422 A reference to the split in the Central Committee of the International Working 
Men's Association for North America, which occurred in December 1871. 
After the London Conference of 1871 strife flared up within the 
Committee between the proletarian and the bourgeois-reformist elements. As a 
result of the split two committees were formed, the Provisional Federal Council 
(Committee No. I), which comprised representatives of the 14 sections 
adhering to the proletarian stand (Friedrich Adolph Sorge, Friedrich Boite, etc.), 
and the separatist council (Committee No. II), headed by Victoria Woodhull 
and other bourgeois reformists belonging to Section No. 12. At its meetings of 
5 and 12 March the General Council voiced its support for the proletarian wing 
of the North American Federation; Section No. 12 was suspended from the 
International pending the next Congress. On 28 May 1872 the General Council

declared the Provisional Federal Council the sole leading body of the North 
American sections. The congress of the North American Federation held in 
July 1872 elected the standing Federal Council which included all members of 
the provisional body (see Engels' 'The International in America' and Marx's 
'American Split', present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 177-83, 636-43).—298, 334, 341, 
381 
423 The second congress of the Spanish Federation of the International was held in 
Saragossa on 4-11 April 1872, attended by 45 delegates representing 31 local 
federations. The congress voted down the demand of Swiss Bakuninists that a 
General Congress be convened without delay, but, under the influence of the 
anarchists, decided to support the revision of the General Rules proposed by 
the Belgian Federation with a view to granting greater autonomy to the local 
sections. Opposing the Bakuninists, the congress ruled the expulsion of the 
editors of La Emancipation from the Federation to be illegal and restored their 
rights.  However, when it came to electing the new Federal Council the 
Bakuninists managed to fill it mostly with members of the Alliance.—299, 301, 
309, 331, 368 
424 The bourgeois radical Charles Bradlaugh made slanderous attacks on Marx in 
a public lecture delivered on 11 December 1871 and in a letter to The Eastern 
Post printed in its second edition on 16 December. At the General Council 
meeting of 19 December Marx pointed to the close link between Bradlaugh's 
behaviour and the harassment of the International by the ruling circles and the 
bourgeois press. 
Replying to the slanderous letters printed in January 1872 by The National 
Reformer, which was edited by Bradlaugh, Marx sent several statements exposing 
them to The Eastern Post (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp.  62-63,  71, 
72-73).—299, 567, 574 
425 In a letter to Engels of 21 December 1871 Pyotr Lavrov asked for two works by 
Alexander Bain, The Senses and the Intellect and The Emotions and the Will, and 
for The Principles of  Psychology  by Herbert Spencer. He also requested Engels to 
look for Sh. H. Hodgson's A New System of  Philosophy  (the title is inaccurate; the 
reference is either to Hodgson's Philosophy of Reflection, published in 1870, or to 
another of his philosophical works).—300 
426 This is a reply to Lafargue's letter of 7 January 1872, in which he wrote that 
the Spanish Federal Council had rejected the Bakuninists' proposal on the 
convocation of an extraordinary Congress but supported the decision of the 
Belgian Federation to consider the revision of the General Rules at the next 
Congress. Knowing that Marx and Engels were working on the Fictitious Splits 
in the International, the General Council's reply to the Sonvillier circular, 
Lafargue warned them against being too personal. In conclusion he wrote that 
he had made arrangements with José Mesa to have Marx's The  Poverty  of Philosophy 
translated into Spanish (see Note 456). 
The letter was published in English for the first time in: Frederick Engels, 
Paul and Laura Lafargue, Correspondence, Vol. I: 1868-1886, Foreign Lan­
guages Publishing House, Moscow, 1959.—301

429 This is Engels' reply to several letters from Theodor Cuno, including that of 
11 January 1872 in which Cuno wrote that he had lost his job as an engineer 
since the owner of the factory made his continued employment conditional on 
his withdrawal from the International. He also wrote that he was threatened 
with deportation from Italy if, as the police had warned him, he did not 
'modify' the nature of his public speeches. 
This letter was published in English for the first time in: Marx and Engels, 
Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1955.— 
305 
430 In a letter of 27 December 1871 Cuno asked Engels for information con­
cerning a 'retired captain with the wooden leg'. The latter, according to one of 
Cuno's friends, had a membership card issued by the General Council and was 
corresponding with London; Cuno suspected him of being a police agent.— 306 
431 The second congress of the League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 257), 
which was held in Berne on 21-25 September 1868, rejected by a majority vote 
the resolution proposed by Bakunin which called for 'economic and social 
equalisation of classes and individuals', 'abolition of the state', and 'abolition of the 
right of inheritance'. Bakunin and his followers withdrew from the League and, in 
the same year, formed an International Alliance of Socialist Democracy (see 
Note 10).—306 
432 In a letter of 14 January 1872, Carlo Terzaghi informed Engels about the 
split in the Workers' Federation (Federazione operaia) and the founding of a 
society called the Emancipation of the Proletarian (see Note 408). He appealed 
to the General Council not to recognise the Workers' Federation as a section of 
the International Working Men's Association. He also asked the General 
Council officially to disavow the statements made by Giuseppe Beghelli, one of 
the leaders of the Workers' Federation.—312 
433 A copy of this letter, written by Marx in reply to Jozewicz's letter of 
6-7 December 1871, was discovered in the Prussian Secret State Archives 
among the documents of Berlin's Police Presidium.—314 
434 At the General Council meeting of 24 October 1871 Hermann Jung read out 
Benoît Malon's letter of 20 October to the Council, in which the latter repeated 
his request that the Section of Propaganda and Revolutionary Socialist Action 
be admitted to the International. Having obtained the opinion of the Romance 
Federal Committee, which strongly opposed recognition of this section, the 
General Council confirmed its earlier decision to refuse admittance.—315 
435 The Sub-Committee (Standing Committee), or Executive Committee, grew out of 
the commission set up at the time of the International's inauguration in 1864 to 
draw up its rules and programme. It comprised corresponding secretaries for 
various countries, the General Council Secretary, and its treasurer. The 
Standing Committee, which had not been envisaged in the Rules of the 
International Working Men's Association, functioned as a working executive 
body. In the summer of 1872 the General Council decided to entrust all 
organisational matters to the Sub-Committee (which in June 1872 was renamed 
the Executive Committee). 
As Corresponding Secretary of the General Council for Switzerland, Jung 
received a large number of letters dealing with the campaign waged by the

Romance Federation against the divisive Bakuninist sections; the letters were 
referred to the Sub-Committee for consideration.—316, 341, 383 
436 The surviving manuscript copy of the letter does not bear the name of the 
addressee. However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject 
indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house 
in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste 
Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agree­
ment on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of Capital. The 
agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice 
Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edi­
tion was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments 
at a time. 
The French authorised edition of Volume I of Capital was published 
between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by 
Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. 
The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was 
convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French 
readers.—316, 319, 328, 343, 362, 367, 374, 377, 379, 385, 396, 399, 405, 409,

437 This is a reply to the request from the firm Asher & Co. (contained in a letter 
of 12 February 1872) to send them a copy of the English edition of the 
Inaugural Address of the Working Men's International Association. 
This letter was published in English for the first time in Unbekanntes von 
Friedrich Engels und Karl Marx. Part I: 1840-1874. Ed. by Bert Andreasjacques 
Grandjonc, Hans Pelger. Papers of the Karl-Marx-Haus, Trier, 1986.—318 
438 In a letter to Engels of 16 January 1872, Liebknecht enquired about the 
amount of tax revenues for the benefit of the poor received in various parishes 
of London. He needed the figures for a criticism of the unequal distribution of 
poor-tax proceeds in the different parts of the German Empire.— 318 
439 At the General Council meeting of 6 February 1872 Marx called attention to 
the fact that Albert Richard and Gaspard Blanc had become Bonapartist agents 
and had shortly before published a pamphlet L'Empire et la France nouvelle. 
Appel du peuple et de la jeunesse à la  conscience  française (Brussels, 1872), in which 
they appealed to the working people of France to assist them in trying to 
restore the Empire. The report on this meeting was carried by The Eastern Post,

440 The Manifesto of the Communist Party was published in English on 30 December 
1871 in the American Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, No. 7. Chapter IV, except for 
the last four paragraphs, was omitted. 
The first and second chapters of the Manifesto were published in French in 
the weekly Le Socialiste, the organ of the French sections of the International in 
the USA, in January-March 1872 under the heading 'Manifeste de Karl Marx' 
(Nos.  16-17, 19-24 and 26 of 20 and 27 January, 10, 17 and 24 February, and 2, 9, 
16 and 30 March 1872).—319, 343, 378 
441 Having advanced a plan to set up the Universal Society of Rationalists, Luigi 
Stefanoni tried to enlist support from a number of prominent members of the 
republican and working-class movements. With this in mind, he wrote to 
Liebknecht on 18 December 1871. The latter, having no real knowledge of 
Stefanoni's plans, sent him a letter of commendation. On receiving the letter

from Engels and acting on his advice, Liebknecht wrote to Stefanoni 
on 29 February expressing unreserved solidarity with the General Council (see 
this volume, p. 577).—320 
442 On 20 January 1872 Becker wrote to Engels that he was forwarding to 
Friedrich Lessner the dues for the International's Milan section which he had 
received from Theodor Cuno. Becker further asked for 100 stamps to be sent 
to Cologne for the admission of new members to the Cologne section of the 
Association.—321 
443 In January 1872 Engels learned from Paul Lafargue that the Spanish Federal 
Council was planning to publish its correspondence with the General Council in 
order to expose the slanders spread by the Jura Federation about the Council's 
'dictatorial practices'. The plan was not carried through.— 322 
444 A reference to the search of Nikolai Utin's (Outine's) flat on 26-28 January 
1872 by the Geneva police who had invented his alleged participation in 
forging Russian banknotes. Utin's papers, including some documents of the 
International he was keeping, were confiscated, and only the intervention of a 
progressive-minded lawyer prevented the Swiss authorities from handing them 
over to the Russian government.—322 
445 A reference to the Administrative Resolutions passed by the Basle Congress of 
1869 (see Note 399).—323 
446 A reference to Article 14 of the Administrative Regulations adopted by the 
Geneva Congress of the International (1866), which states that the rules and 
bye-laws of individual sections must not contain anything contrary to the General 
Rules and Regulations of the International. This article corresponds to Article 12 
of the English edition of the Regulations (see present edition, Vol. 20, 
p. 446).—323 
447 A draft of this letter was written by Engels across Burrs' letter to him of 
19 February 1872. The former letter, as well as Engels' draft letters to 
J. Molesworth (written after 5 June) and to Th. Smart & Co. (3 July), are replies 
to enquiries by the relevant companies regarding E. Glaser de Willebrord's 
solvency and his reliability as a potential partner (see this volume, pp. 391 and 
406).—324 
448 When this letter was first published in Die Gesellschaft magazine (from the 
manuscript copy kept in the Prussian Secret State Archives), it was erroneously 
believed to be addressed to Fritz Milke. It is in fact a reply to Jozewicz's letter 
of 10 February 1872. 
This letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx, On the 
First International Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new 
translations by Saul K. Padover. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York,

449 The reference is to Resolution X of the 1871 London Conference, 'General 
Resolution as to the Countries Where the Regular Organisation of the 
International Is Interfered with by the Governments' (see present edition, 
Vol. 22, pp. 427-28).—325 
450 On 11 June 1872, on Marx's suggestion, the General Council resolved to 
convene a regular Congress in Holland on 2 September 1872 and decided on 
the principal item on the agenda, the consolidation of the International's 
organisation (revision of the General Rules and Administrative Regulations).

At its next meeting on 18 June the Council decided on The Hague as the 
venue for the Congress and appointed a special commission (Engels, Edouard 
Vaillant, Joseph MacDonnel) to prepare an official announcement of the 
forthcoming Congress. The announcement was written by Engels and 
despatched to The International  Herald,  which published it on 29 June 1872 (see 
present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 170-73).—325, 366, 372, 374, 376, 392, 396, 398,

452 The Dresden Congress of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party held 
between 12 and 15 August 1871 decided on Hamburg as the Party Committee 
headquarters.—326, 376, 508 
453 A reference to the regular meeting of the General Council due to be held on 
27 February 1872; Council members were unable to get to the meeting because 
of a public procession on that day to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of 
Wales.—326 
464 Marx is apparently referring to Lafargue's letter to him written between 17 and 
24 February 1872.—327 
456 Maurice Lachâtre, the publisher of Volume I of Capital in French, intended to 
include a biography of Marx. Passing on Lachâtre's wish in a letter of 
12 December 1871, Laura Lafargue also wrote that Paul Lafargue would 
undertake to write the biography. Lachâtre subsequently approached Engels 
with this proposal (see this volume, pp. 478-79).—327 
456 On 7 January 1872 Laf argue wrote to Engels that since Proudhonist ideas held 
considerable sway with Spanish workers he had arranged with José Mesa to 
have Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy translated into Spanish, and passed on 
Mesa's request that a special foreword be written for the Spanish edition. 
However, the translation was not completed, and the foreword was not written. 
Several excerpts translated into Spanish were carried by La Emancipaciôn. —327 
457 In a letter written around 14 February 1872, Lafargue asked Marx to send him 
several copies of the Inaugural Address, General Rules, The Eighteenth Brumaire of 
Louis Bonaparte, and The Civil War in France, and also of Joseph Dietzgen's 
works.—327 
458 A reference to Lafargue's repeated requests for assistance in establishing 
ongoing contacts between La Emancipaciôn and Der Volksstaat edited by 
Wilhelm Liebknecht. We do not know whether Marx wrote to Liebknecht as he 
had promised Lafargue.—327 
459 In his letters to Marx written in February 1872 Lafargue proposed to get 
Lopez de Lara, a Spanish businessman residing in London, to finance 
publication of the International's official documents.—328 
460 This excerpt is part of Engels' non-extant reply to Borkheim's letter of 
24 February 1872. Borkheim wrote about Friedrich Adolph Sorge's request to 
recommend him books on the history of Ireland written from the materialist 
standpoint. Replying to Sorge on 15 March Borkheim quoted Engels' letter.

462 On 22 September 1871 the ninth session of the London Conference heard the 
case of James Cohen. The Belgian delegates voiced their indignation at Cohen 
who,  sent to Belgium by the General Council in the summer of 1871 to 
organise aid to the striking machine-builders in Newcastle, acted not as a 
Council delegate but as a trade union representative. On returning to England 
Cohen tried to take credit for everything accomplished by the Belgian sections 
of the International. At Engels' suggestion the Conference passed a vote of 
censure on Cohen.—330 
463 Probably a reference to the letter sent by the Committee of the Jura Federation 
to the Belgian Federal Council on 7 February 1872, which reported on the 
decision of the Committee to renounce its demand for an immediate Congress 
of the International.—331, 335, 337 
464 A reference to the parliamentary elections to be held on 24 September 1872. 
Louis Pio and Paul  Geleff,  leaders of the Danish Federal Council, were 
nominated workers' candidates in Copenhagen. At the time of the elections 
they were in prison, having been arrested on 4 May, and failed to win the 
required number of votes.— 332 
465 A reference to one of the groups formed following the collapse of the French 
Section of 1871 (see Note 338). The General Council refused to admit this 
group to the International, since its Rules were at odds with the principles 
behind the General Rules.—333 
466 xhe letter was written on a letterhead of the General Council bearing its 
previous address, 256 High Holborn, London, W.C. Marx crossed it out and 
wrote in the new address, 33 Rathbone Place, W.C.—333 
467 At the General Council meeting of 20 February 1872 Johann Georg Eccarius 
reported that he had sent copies of the General Rules and Administrative 
Regulations to the address of J. W. Gregory, a member of the International in 
New York. Following Gregory's death in January 1872 the International's 
documents fell into the hands of petty-bourgeois elements in sections Nos. 12 
and 9.-334 
468 xhe Provisional Federal Council of the International Working Men's Associa­
tion for North America protested against the appointment by the General 
Council of a special secretary for the French sections in the USA. In a letter to 
Marx of 8 March 1872 Sorge wrote that the protest originated from the Irish 
members of the International.—334 
469 A reference to the poem 'jLeed y estremeceos!' enclosed by Lafargue with his 
letter to Engels of 11 February 1872.—339 
470 A reference to Engels' account of the report of the Danish Federal Council and 
of Pio's article 'Om vore Landboforhold' (Socialisten, No. 17, 4 November 
1871),  made at the General Council meeting of 5 December 1871. The account 
was included in the report on the General Council meeting carried by The 
Eastern Post, No. 167, 9 December 1871. The translations of these items which 
Engels sent to Spain and Portugal were published in La Emancipation, No. 31, 
14 January 1872, and O Pensamento Social, Nos. 1 and 2, February and March 
1872.—340

Notes 647 
471 During discussion of the split in the Central Committee of the International 
Working Men's Association for North America (see Note 422) at the General 
Council, Johann Georg Eccarius spoke out against Article 2 of Resolution III, 
specifically against the part reading: 'For these reasons the General Council 
recommends that in future there be admitted no new American section of 
which two-thirds at least do not consist of wage-labourers'.— 341 
472 On 1 February 1872 New York Section No. 10 sent the General Council a copy 
of its letter to the separatist Federal Committee in which it censured attempts 
by bourgeois reformists to use the International to promote their own 
ends.—342 
473 The General Council meeting of 20 February 1872 approved Hermann Jung's 
proposal to mark the anniversaries of the Paris Commune with mass rallies in 
London. Still, the public meeting, for which  5,000  French and British 
democrats had gathered, did not take place, since at the last moment the owner 
of the hall where it was to be held refused admission. The meeting then elected 
150 delegates who made their way to Frances Street, where the Cercle d'Études 
Sociales was housed (see Note 613), and marked 18 March, the first anniversary 
of the Paris Commune, with a ceremony. At the suggestion of Commune 
members Albert Theisz and Zéphirin Camélinat and General Council member 
George Milner, the delegates adopted three short resolutions written by Marx 
(see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 128).—343, 347, 362 
474 -pne facsimile of this letter was published as the preface to the French edition 
of Capital (see Note 436). In English it appeared for the first time in: Karl Marx, 
Capital, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1954.—344 
475 This letter was written on the basis of the information received from Vitale 
Regis.  In the second half of February 1872, on the instructions of the General 
Council, Regis (under the pseudonym of Etienne Pechard) spent ten days in 
Milan and Turin, where, acting on Engels' instructions, he was to acquaint 
himself with the actual state of affairs in the International's sections. 
Regis described his trip in a letter to Engels of 1 March; he wrote about 
Carlo Terzaghi's expulsion from the Turin section of the International—the 
Emancipation of the Proletarian society — and his suspicions of Terzaghi's 
contacts with the police. This information prompted Engels to demand that 
Terzaghi explain his behaviour (see this volume, p. 352). 
The original is mistakenly addressed to Carlo Bert and not Cesare Bert. 
Engels wrote across the letter: 'London, 21 March 1872. To C. Bert, 
Turin.'—345 
476 A reference to Article 5 of Section II of the Administrative Regulations 
published on the decision of the 1871 London Conference; this article 
corresponds to Administrative Resolution V passed by the 1869 Basle Congress 
(see Note 399).—345

478 A reference to the report delivered by Jean François Sacase at the French 
National Assembly on 5 February 1872 on behalf of the commission 
considering Jules Dufaure's bill, under which membership of the International 
was punishable by imprisonment. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 
14 March 1872. 

=====第682页=====
648 Notes 
Using the epithet 'Rural' with reference to Sacase, Marx implies his 
membership of the 'Assembly of Rurals', a derogatory name given to the 
National Assembly convened on 12 February 1871 in Bordeaux; it comprised 
mostly reactionary monarchists, provincial landowners, civil servants, rentiers 
and tradesmen elected in rural constituencies.—346, 505 
479 On Marx's final assessment of Joseph Roy's translation, as well as on Marx's 
participation in preparing the French edition of Volume I of Capital, see 
'Afterword to the French Edition' (present edition, Vol. 35), Note 436, and 
pp. 385, 515, 578 of this volume.—347 
480 Mar x sent Lafargue excerpts from a private circular entitled Fictitious Splits in 
the International and written by Engels and himself between mid-January and 
early March 1872, but not yet published at the time this letter was posted (see 
present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 79-123). The extracts enclosed with the letter 
correspond in content to the relevant section in Part IV of the Fictitious Splits. 
However, these extracts, apart from certain omissions and changes as compared 
to the published version, contain a number of remarks by Marx (he enclosed some 
of them in square brackets) that were not included in the pamphlet. In the present 
edition, the passages that are taken verbatim from the published version are 
enclosed in inverted commas. 
Besides, since the circular refers to the articles of the original Rules, published 
in English in 1867 (see present edition, Vol. 20, Appendices), Marx adds in 
brackets the corresponding articles of the official version of the General Rules 
published in late 1871 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 3-20).—348 
481 On Vitale Regis' (Etienne Pechard's) trip to Milan and Turin, see Note  475.—

482 In a letter of 10 March 1872 Terzaghi asked Engels to remember him to Pietro 
Savio, an Italian refugee Communard.—353 
483 A draft of the letter has also survived which, with the exception of the deleted 
passage (reproduced as a footnote) and several phrases crossed out by Engels, 
coincides with the text published here.—354 
484 A reference to the Eleventh Congress of Italian pro-Mazzini Workers' 
Associations held in Naples on 25-27 October 1864. At the congress, Gennaro 
Bovio, representative of the Workers' Association of Trani, suggested that 
international workers' congresses be regularly convened, and that common 
Rules be worked out for them.—354 
485 A piece Engels wrote on the persecution of Cuno was carried by The Eastern 
Post, No. 187, 27 April, and by the Gazzettino Rosa, No. 127, 7 May 1872 (see 
present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 151-52). Acting on Engels' advice, on 3 May Cuno 
wrote a letter to Der Volksstaat, which was published in No. 38 of 11 May 1872; 
a report on Cuno also appeared on 7 May in L'Égalité, Nos. 9 and 10.—356 
486 Yhe Fascio Operaio (Workers' Union) was founded on 27 November 1871 in 
Bologna with Erminio Pescatori as its leader. The Union did not directly 
declare that it was joining the International, but its manifesto, which was 
approved on 4 December, did proclaim the principle of international solidarity 
of the working people. The Union acted as a governing centre for similar 
organisations formed at the turn of 1871-72 in a number of towns in the 
Emilia-Romagna (Imola, Forli, Lugo, Rimini, etc.). It did not maintain regular 
contacts with the International.—  358,  391, 419

Notes 649 
487 The congress in Bologna was the first congress of anarchist groups from 
Mirandola, Genoa and Mantua, as well as representatives of the International's 
section in Naples and of the Romagna's workers' unions (Fascii opérai), held 
on 17-19 March 1872. A number of congress resolutions bore the imprint of 
Bakuninism; in particular, the congress opposed participation in the elections 
and declared that it regarded the General Council and the Jura Federal 
Committee as mere correspondence bureaus.—358 
488 A reference to one of the democratic societies in Ravenna, which, through the 
offices of Lodovico Nabruzzi, Sesto Montanari and Resta Luca, who were on II 
Romagnolo editorial board, requested Engels in late October 1871 to help them 
organise a section of the International. Engels replied to Nabruzzi in early 
November (the letter has not been found). On November 25 the latter wrote to 
Engels about considerable successes in spreading the ideas of the International. 
However, that is where the correspondence ended. On 3 December 1871 
L'Internationale, No. 151, in its 'Bulletin de l'intérieur' column, carried a notice 
about the establishment of a section in Ravenna. Bakunin had managed to win 
Nabruzzi over to his side.—358 
489 "phis assessment of the outcome of the Saragossa congress (see Note 423) was 
based on the information Engels received from Paul Lafargue. Following the 
receipt of more accurate information on the congress, specifically, on its 
decision to support the Belgian Federation's demand that the General Rules be 
revised, Engels changed his opinion. He wrote to Wilhelm Liebknecht about 
this on 22 May 1872 (see this volume, pp. 375-76).—358, 361, 375 
490 On 14 March 1872 at the trial in Leipzig, replying to the question of defence 
counsel Freytag II from Plauen about the strength of the International 
in Germany, August Bebel quoted the figure of 1,000 members.— 360 
491 In his letters to Engels of 28 and 30 March 1872, Liebknecht wrote about 
violations of legal procedure at the Leipzig trial (the pressure placed on the 
jury by the prosecuting counsel, who constandy mixed with the jury and 
visited inns with them, etc.), and asked him about the corresponding English 
procedure. 
Engels mentions the Tichborne trial in London against adventurer Arthur 
Orton who, posing as Roger Charles Tichborne, tried to obtain a legacy by 
means of forgery and fabricated evidence; the trial began on 11 May 1871 and 
lasted until April 1872.—360 
492 Responding to the slanderous article, 'Wie Karl Marx citirt', written by the 
German bourgeois economist Lujo Brentano and published in the Concordia 
magazine, No. 10, 7 March 1872, Marx wrote a letter to Der Volksstaat on 
23 May, which the newspaper carried on 1 June 1872 (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, pp. 164-67). Following the publication of Marx's reply in Der 
Volksstaat, Concordia, No. 27, 4 July 1872, featured another anonymous article 
(also written by Brentano), 'Wie Karl Marx sich vertheidigt'. Marx's reply to the 
second article was published in Der Volksstaat, No. 63, 7 August 1872 (see 
present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 190-97).—360, 376, 410, 415 
493 xhe penny press became widespread in England after the abolition, in 1855, 
of the stamp tax which greatly increased the price of newspapers.—361

board of Der Volksstaat intended to publish the Manifesto of  the Communist Party

as a separate pamphlet and requested the preface to this edition as promised. 
Marx and Engels wrote the preface to the new edition on 24 June 1872 (see 
present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 174-75).—361, 374 
495 Probably a reference to Police Terrorism in  Ireland,  a leaflet issued by the 
General Council of the International around 9 April 1872, and either to 
Propaganda Fund for Ireland (April 21st, 1872), a leaflet by the General Council 
Corresponding Secretary for Ireland Joseph Patrick MacDonnel, or to his To 
the Irish Sections of the International and the Working Classes in General (March 
26th,  1872).—362 
496 This is a reply to Eccarius' letter of 2 May 1872, which he had written 
following the General Council's discussion of his behaviour in dealing with the 
split in the Central Committee of the International Working Men's Association 
for North America. 
After the General Council meetings of 5 and 12 March 1872 had approved 
the relevant resolutions proposed by Marx, John Hales (Council Secretary) and 
Eccarius (Corresponding Secretary for the USA) took up a conciliatory position 
towards the American bourgeois reformist elements. Eccarius opposed the 
expulsion of Section No. 12 and spoke out against Article 2 of Resolution III 
(see Note 471), accusing Friedrich Adolph Sorge and Section No. 1 (see 
Note 354), which he headed, of divisive activities. He refused to send the 
above-mentioned resolutions to the USA, stating in a number of letters (e.g. to 
petty-bourgeois activist John Elliott) that he strongly disapproved of them. 
On 23 April 1872 the General Council meeting instructed Marx to prepare 
a detailed report on Eccarius' stand. 
Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx, 
On the First International Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new 
translations by Saul K. Padover. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 
1973.—363,  379 
497 In early February 1866 on Marx's insistence and contrary to the wishes of trade 
union leaders, Eccarius was appointed editor-in-chief of The Commonwealth, the 
official organ of the International Working Men's Association. 
In September-October 1867, the General Council discussed the clash 
between Peter Fox and Eccarius. Fox had accused Eccarius of insulting some of 
the delegates to the Lausanne Congress in his reports published in The Times on 
6, 9, 10 and 11 September.—363, 380 
498 A reference to Eccarius' article on the 1871 London Conference in the 
American newspaper The  World,  which quoted some of its resolutions 
despite the Conference's decision not to make them public without 
special instructions from the General Council. Following investigation of this 
fact by the commission appointed by the Council on 10 October (with 
Hermann Jung as chairman, George Milner and George Harris), Eccarius was 
reprimanded at the General Council meeting of 30 January 1872.—  363,  381 
499 In a letter to Eccarius of 30 November 1871 J. W. Gregory, a member of the 
International in the USA and supporter of the bourgeois reformists, accused 
Section No. 1 (see Note 354) of divisive activities.—363 
500 Engels is referring to Paul Lafargue's report 'Apertura del secundo congreso 
obrero de la region espafiola' on the Saragossa Congress of the Spanish 
Federation (see Note 423) carried by La Emancipaciôn, No. 44, 13 April 
1872.—365

501 This is a reference to Lafargue's reports on the Saragossa Congress of the 
Spanish Federation which appeared in La Liberté, Brussels. The first report, 
dated 9 April, was printed in No. 17 of 28 April 1872, and also carried by Der 
Volksstaat, No. 36, 4 May 1872. 
The second report, 'Congrès de Saragosse', written on 12 April, contained 
revelations about the secret Alliance and was published in La Liberté, No. 18, 
5 May, and reprinted, in part, by Der Volksstaat, No. 41, 22 May 1872. On 
Lafargue's exaggeration of the successes scored by the General Council 
supporters at the Saragossa congress, see Note 489.—  365,  368, 375 
502 Der Volksstaat, Nos. 35 and 36, 1 and 4 May 1872, printed the first two 
instalments of the article by the French lawyer Emile Acollas translated as 'Die 
Republik und die Gegenrevolution' (first published in the Suisse Radicale, and 
later as a pamphlet).— 365 
503 Liebknecht used the materials received from Engels in the 'Politische 
Uebersicht' column of Der Volksstaat, No. 40, 18 May 1872.—366 
so4 Der Volksstaat, Nos.  10-13,  15 and 19 of 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21 February and 
6 March 1872, reprinted from the Austrian workers' newspaper Volkswille a series 
of anonymous articles under the heading 'Die Wohnungsfrage'. The author of the 
articles was a doctor of medicine, the Proudhonist Arthur Mülberger. On 22 May 
Engels sent Liebknecht his reply to Miilberger's articles, which formed Part I of 
his work The Housing Question (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 315-37).— 366, 
405,  478 
505 A reference to the arrest of members of the Danish Federal Council of the 
International, including Louis Pio, editor of the Socialisten, Harald Brix and 
Paul  Geleff,  which took place in the night from 4 to 5 May 1872. They were 
charged with the propagation of socialist ideas 'threatening public order'. In 
March 1873 the Danish court sentenced the local leaders of the International to 
various terms of imprisonment.— 366 
506 Engels reported on the Italian government's attempt to place the blame for the 
fire at the Milan Agricultural Academy on members of the International at the 
General Council meeting of 30 April 1872. Cuno had informed him of the fact on 
25 April 1872. Engels' speech was included in the report on the meeting carried 
by The Eastern Post, No. 188, 4 May 1872.—368 
507 On 3 March 1872 a letter was despatched to Engels informing him about the 
establishment of the Society of Ferrarese Workers and its intention to declare 
itself a section of the International. After its Rules were revised to conform 
with the General Rules of the Association, the General Council on 7 May 1872 
admitted the Society of Ferrarese Workers to the International.— 369 
508 Cuno wrote to Engels on 6 May 1872 that he had been forced to flee from 
Germany to Belgium, having learnt that he was wanted by the Prussian 
police.— 369 
509 The reference is to the uprising of the Paris proletariat of 23-26 June 1848 (see 
Note 113).—372 
510 A reference to the letter written by Pierre Schlebach to Liebknecht on behalf of

the organisational structure of the Lassallean General Association of German 
Workers.—373 
511 In a letter to Liebknecht of 17 April 1872, Sorge wrote that Eccarius' behaviour 
was strengthening the positions of the bourgeois reformist elements in the 
North American Federation (see Note 496).—374 
812 On 8 May 1872 Liebknecht wrote to Engels: 'We now have  5,500  subscribers, an 
increase of 800 this quarter'.— 374 
513 A reference to the editorial in the Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne, No. 6, 
10 May 1872, a reply to Paul Lafargue's report 'Congrès de Saragosse' featured 
by La Liberté on 5 May (see Note 501). The editorial disclosed that Pablo Farga 
was Lafargue's pseudonym in Spain.— 374 
514 Engels apparently sent Liebknecht a report on the General Council meeting of 
7 May published in The Eastern Post, No. 189, 12 May 1872. 
The Eastern Post was a daily with a morning and an evening edition.—374 
515 On 15 May 1872 Liebknecht wrote to Engels: 'You will have to get a new 
edition of your Condition of the Working-Class etc. printed, since the old one is 
pretty well sold out.' The first edition of The Condition of the Working-Class in 
England was issued in early June 1845 by Otto Wigand's publishing house in 
Leipzig (see present edition, Vol. 4). In his letter, Liebknecht also mentioned the 
prospects of publishing Marx's and Engels' collected works.— 375 
516 Engels is referring to Resolution IX of the Saragossa Congress of the Spanish 
Federation. The resolution declared that the congress supported the decision of 
the congress of the Belgian Federation that the International's General Rules 
should be revised.—376 
517 Enclosed with Liebknecht's letter to Engels of 15 May 1872 was a receipt from 
Der Volksstaat's forwarding agent Wilhelm Fink testifying to the sale of 
208 copies of the General Rules of the International Working Men's 
Association, and the corresponding number of stamps pasted to them as 
membership fees.—376 
518 A reference to the letters from Johann Georg Eccarius and John Hales to the 
members of New York Section No. 12, which had been expelled from the 
International by the General Council, in which they stated their disagreement 
with this decision. Hales' letter was printed by Le Socialiste on 18 May 
1872.—378 
519 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in Marx and Engels 
on the United States, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1979.—380 
520 A reference to Johann Georg Eccarius' letter to Liebknecht of 20 May 1872 
dealing with the discussion in the General Council of the stand adopted by 
John Hales and himself on the split in the Central Committee of the 
International Working Men's Association for North America. See this volume, 
pp. 363 and 579-81.—380 
521 A reference to the Judicial Committee elected at the General Council meeting of 
13 February 1872, which consisted of Armand Arnaud, Gabriel Ranvier, 
Frederick Bradnick, George Milner, Karl Pfänder, Hermann Jung and Walery 
Wrôblewski, with the latter as chairman.— 382 
822 A reference to the appeal of the separatist Federal Council (Committee No. II) 
in New York, which was published in the Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, 
No. 25/103, 4 May 1872. A detailed analysis of this appeal was made by Engels

523 At the meeting held in Apollo Hall, New York, on 9-11 May 1872, the 
followers of Victoria Woodhull nominated her for the post of US President.— 
384 
524 The congress of the Belgian Federation held in Brussels on 19-20 May 1872 
considered the draft Rules which had been drawn up by the Belgian Federal 
Council on the instructions of the Federation's congress held on 24-
25 December 1871 (see Note 404). Under this draft, which was written by 
Eugène Hins, the powers of the General Council to all intents and purposes 
were to be annulled and the Council turned into a mere correspondence and 
statistical bureau. After heated debates the congress decided to submit the draft 
for discussion by the sections, and then for approval by the Federation's 
extraordinary congress scheduled for July 1872 (see Note 568).— 384, 387, 393,

Frederick Engels, Letters on 'Capital'. Translated by Andrew Drummond. New 
Park Publications, London, 1983.—385 
526 Between 1872 and 1875 Marx presented the British Museum Library with 
three editions of Volume I of Capital: the second German, the Russian and the 
French edition. 
On 9 August and 15 November 1873 Marx received letters from J. Winter 
Jones,  the principal librarian of the British Museum, expressing gratitude for 
the gift: 'I am directed by the Trustees of the British Museum to inform you 
that they have received the Present..., which you have been pleased to make to 
them; and I have to return you their best thanks for the same.'—385 
527 In a letter of 15 (27) March 1872 Danielson informed Marx that after eleven 
months in prison, Hermann Lopatin had been released on condition that he 
did not leave Irkutsk.— 386 
528 Marx's letter to V. O. Baranov has not been found. As can be inferred from 
Baranov's reply of 10 (22) June 1872, Marx had asked him for information 
about the progress of Bakunin's translation into Russian of Volume I of 
Capital (see Note 574).—386 
529 A reference to the so-called Nechayev trial (see Note 280, as well as present 
edition, Vol. 23, p. 23).—386, 422 
630 At the General Council meeting of 28 May 1872 John Hales read out a report 
on the work of the Provisional Federal Council (Committee No. I) of the North 
American sections for April 1872, which had been signed by the Council 
Secretary Charles Praitsching on 5 May. The report dealt with the unsuccessful 
attempts to reach an agreement with the separatist council on the basis of the 
General Council resolutions of 5 and 12 March 1872 (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, pp. 124-26).—388 
531 Under the resolution passed by the General Council on 28 May 1872 the 
Provisional Federal Council of the North American sections of the Internation­
al was recognised as the only lawful one.—388 
532 In late May 1872 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dresden confirmed the 
verdict reached by the Leipzig court in March 1872 at the trial of August Bebel 
and Wilhelm Liebknecht (see Note 274).—389

654 Notes 
533 A reference to the list of members of the German Social-Democratic Workers' 
Party who were to liaise with the General Council of the International during 
Bebel's and Liebknecht's imprisonment. The list was cited by Liebknecht in his 
letter to Engels of 4 June 1872.—390 
534 This draft of Engels' reply to Molesworth was added to the letter which he 
posted to Engels in Leicester on 5 June 1872. 
On the reasons which prompted Engels to write this letter, see Note 447.— 
391 
535 Engels is referring to a notice in the Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne, No. 6, 
10 May 1872, stating that the editorial board was in possession of Engels' letters 
written in the autumn of 1871 to 'his Italian friends'. These letters had been 
handed over by Carlo Cafiero to the newspaper's editor James Guillaume. — 
393, 397 
536 A reference to Engels' letter to Cuno of 22[-23] April 1872 (see this volume, 
pp. 356-59). It was addressed to Düsseldorf and arrived there on 25 April but 
apparendy missed Cuno and was forwarded to him in Seraing (Belgium).—393 
537 La Emancipaciân, Nos. 52 and 53, 8 and 15 June 1872, featured an article 
entitled 'El proyecto belga de Estatutos générales', which sharply criticised the 
draft Rules drawn up by the Belgian Federal Council.—394, 399, 401 
538 On 15 June 1872 Wilhelm Liebknecht began to serve in the Hubertusburg 
fortress the prison sentence to which he had been condemned at the Leipzig 
trial (see Note 274). He remained in prison until 15 April 1874.—394, 425, 
479 
539 On 12 May 1872 a plebiscite rejected the government draft bill under which 
the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, adopted on 12 September 1848, 
was to be revised. The draft bill, which provided for the introduction of a 
uniform army, school and legislation for the entire country, caused disagree­
ment within the International's sections in Switzerland, with the supporters of 
stronger central authority on one side, and those who advocated retention of 
the cantons' autonomous rights on the other.—395, 418 
540 Engels is referring to Nikolai Utin's article, 'Le fédéralisme ou la centralisation. 
Voulons-nous la souveraineté républicaine ou la dictature monarchique?', 
featured by L'Égalité, No. 9-10, 7 May 1872. Utin opposed the trends towards 
centralisation evident in the new draft Constitution of the Swiss Confedera­
tion.—396 
541 Probably a reference to the work by Johann Philipp Becker, Neue Stunden der 
Andacht (Geneva, 1875) on which he worked intermittently from 1857 to 1875. 
The work was permeated with the spirit of militant materialism and atheism, 
and was a biting political pamphlet.—396 
542 This letter was published in English for the first time in: Marx, Engels, Lenin, 
Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1972.—397 
543 Enclosed with Sorge's letter to Marx of 7 June 1872 was the report of the 
Provisional Federal Council for May of the same year.— 398 
544 La Emancipaciân, No. 43, 6 April 1872, carried the General Council's resolu­
tions of 5 and 12 March 1872 on the split in the Central Committee of the 
International Working Men's Association for North America. The editorial 
introduction noted the great importance of these resolutions to the campaign

against the attempts by bourgeois politicians to use the working-class movement 
to further their own ends.—399 
545 Marx is referring to Resolution IV, 'Contre la suppression du Conseil Général', 
adopted by the Fourth Congress of the International's Romance Federation, 
which was held in Vevey on 2-3 June 1872. It appeared in L'Égalité, No. 12, on 
13 June 1872. The Congress unreservedly supported the resolutions of the 
1871 London Conference and turned down the proposal of the Belgian 
Federal Council for a revision of the General Rules of the Association.— 399, 
401 
546 Marx quotes and partly renders in his own words Nikolai Danielson's letter of 
23 May (4 June) 1872. The information concerning the publication and 
circulation of Volume I of Capital is also taken from this letter.—399 
547 On 7 June 1872 Sorge wrote to Marx that Nicholson, the treasurer of the 
Provisional Federal Council of the North American sections, had stopped 
attending the Council's meetings and disappeared altogether.—400 
548 Marx's letter is a reply to Suetendael's letter of 20 June 1872. He thanked 
Marx for having sent him the General Council's circular on Fictitious Splits in 
the International, inquired about Eugène Hins' draft, and wrote about the 
dissent within the International's Brussels section.—400 
549 Pietists, adherents of a mystical Lutheran trend which originated in Germany in 
the 17th century and placed religious feeling above religious dogmas.—402 
550 Hepner wrote on 29 June 1872 that he was forwarding Engels Karl Boruttau's 
letter requesting the recommendation of material for the campaign against 
Bakunin.—404 
551 A reference to the special issue of the Bulletin de la Federation jurassienne, 
No. 10-11,  15 June 1872, which featured replies from a number of Bakuninists 
to the General Council's circular Fictitious Splits in the International (including 
those from James Guillaume, Benoît Malon, and Mikhail Bakunin), as well as the 
reply of the editorial board to Paul Lafargue's letter in which he had exposed the 
activities of the secret Alliance in Spain.—405 
552 On 29 June 1872 Hepner wrote to Engels requesting that he ask the Wigand 
publishing house in Leipzig to return the remaining copies of the first edition of 
Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England for transmission to Der 
Volksstaat publishers.— 405 
553 The draft of Engels' letter to Th. Smart & Co. was added to the firm's letter to 
Engels posted in Leicester on 3 July 1872. On the motives behind Engels' 
letter, see Note 447.—406 
554 The reference is to the article 'La burguesia y la Internacional en los 
Estados-Unidos' carried by La Emancipation, No. 54, 22 June 1872. The article 
exposed the attempt by bourgeois reformists to use the International's 
organisation in the USA to promote their own ends. It was based on the 
materials sent by Engels to Paul Lafargue.—-407 
555 Bakunin's letter 'Réponse du citoyen Bakounine. Aux compagnons rédacteurs 
du Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne' was printed by the Bulletin on 15 June

656 Notes 
657 In a separate edition of Part I of The Housing Question issued by Der Volksstaat 
publishers in 1872, Engels made the following note after the sentence 'It 
contains no part which is interest on capital, unless the house is encumbered 
with a mortgage debt': 'For the capitalist who buys a ready-built house, part of 
the rent price, which is not composed of ground rents and overhead expenses, 
may appear in the form of interest on capital. But this alters nothing because it 
does not matter whether the builder of the house lets it himself or sells it for 
that purpose to another capitalist.' 
In 1887, when preparing the second edition of his work, Engels amended 
this passage and omitted the note (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 334).—410 
858 On 8 May 1872 Paul Lindau, a bourgeois democrat who published Die 
Gegenwart magazine in Berlin, again asked Marx to contribute to the magazine; 
Lindau requested Marx to write an article about the International.—410 
559 This is Engels' reply to the letter from the Workers' Union (Fascio Operaio) 
in Florence of 27 June 1872 signed by Ugo Bartorelli. Engels made a note on the 
letter in German and Italian: 'Florence, 27 June 1872. Workers' Union. 
Answered 18 July. Reply enclosed'—411 
560 Engels goes on to quote Article 4 of Section II ('The General Council') of the 
Administrative Regulations. This article corresponds to Administrative Resol­
ution IV passed by the Basle Congress (1869) of the International.—411 
561 Article 1 of Section V ('Local Societies, Branches, and Groups') of the 
Administrative Regulations corresponds to Article 14 of the Regulations 
adopted by the Geneva Congress (1866) of the International (see present 
edition, Vol. 20, p. 446).—411 
562 The letter contains the text of Article 8 adopted at the General Council 
meeting of 23 July 1872 on the suggestion of Edouard Vaillant during the 
discussion of the new draft General Rules and Administrative Regulations (see 
Note 570). The Hague Congress incorporated it into the General Rules as 
Article 7a (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 243). 
Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx, 
On the First International Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new 
translations by Saul K. Padover. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 
1973.—413 
663 The reference is to the address entitled 'The General Council to All the 
Members of the International Working Men's Association' (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, pp. 205-10), drafted by Engels on the instructions of the Sub-
Committee (see Note 435). At the General Council meeting of 6 August 1872 
the draft provoked a lively discussion, with some of the Council's members op­
posing publication of the address pending an investigation into the Alliance's 
activities. The draft proposed by Engels was accepted by a majority vote. 
The document has survived in Engels' handwriting in English and in French. 
It did not appear in Der Volksstaat.—  415, 417, 420 
564 Following the exposure by Paul Lafargue in April-early May 1872 of the existence 
of the secret Alliance in Spain, Engels requested Lafargue, José Mesa, Francisco 
Mora and the other editors of La Emancipaciôn to let him have documentary proof 
of the Alliance's activities. By early August 1872 Engels received from Spain a 
copy of Bakunin's letter to Mora of 5 April 1872, the statutes of the Alliance in 
Spain, and other documents. These materials were used by Engels when drafting 
the above-mentioned address of the General Council.—  415,  420

Notes 657 
565 Enclosed with Hepner's letter to Engels of 22 July 1872 was a cutting from the 
Frankfurter Zeitung on the prospects of a military conflict between Germany on 
the one hand, and Russia and France on the other. It mentioned the 
appointment of Verdy du Vernois, Colonel of the General  Staff,  as head of the 
Headquarters of the First Army Corps stationed along the Russian border. The 
authors thought that the transfer had been occasioned by Colonel Verdy's 
involvement in the activities of leading financial quarters.— 415 
566 When discussing the possible consequences of a new European war inspired by 
the militarists, Engels surmised that in the course of such a conflict the German 
Empire could collapse in a manner similar to the Bonapartist Second Empire in 
France, which fell two days after the defeat at Sedan on 1-2 September 
1870.—415 
567 In discussing the draft Rules drawn up by the Belgian Federal Council (see 
Note 524), the members of the German section of the International in Verviers 
voiced their firm support of the General Council. In response, as Cuno wrote 
to Engels on 26 July 1872, the Bakuninist majority on the Belgian Federal 
Council tried to blacken the character of one of the section's members and 
demanded that he be expelled from the International. The section in question 
having refused to comply, it was expelled from the Belgian Federation by the 
Federal Council.—416 
568 The reference is to the extraordinary congress of the Belgian Federation held 
in Brussels on 14 July 1872. It discussed the new draft of the General Rules of 
the International drawn up by Eugene Hins, which provided for the annulment 
of the powers of the General Council, thus turning it into a mere correspondence 
and statistical bureau. The majority (9 delegates out of 13) voted for the retention 
of the General Council, with its powers somewhat curtailed.— 419 
569 The protest against the venue of the Congress was sent by Adhémar 
Schwitzguébel to the General Council on 15 July 1872 on behalf and on the 
instructions of the Jura Federation.— 419 
570 "The General Council, having included revision of the General Rules and 
Administrative Regulations in the agenda of the Hague Congress, began 
discussing the changes to be made in these documents on 25 June 1872. As a 
result, new draft Rules and Regulations were adopted (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, pp. 198-204), including, as Article 8, Resolution IX passed by the 1871 
London Conference, 'Political Action of the Working Class'; its text was 
re-edited (see this volume, p. 414). The draft also incorporated articles 
specifying more precisely and extending the functions of the General Council. 
The Hague Congress, which did not consider the draft Rules and 
Regulations in their entirety, incorporated the resolution 'Political Action of the 
Working Class' into the Rules as Article 7a; it also included in the Rules several 
administrative resolutions (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 243-53).—420 
571 This letter is a draft of Engels' complaint to the Judicial Committee of the 
General Council (see Note 521). Engels decided to appeal because at the 
Council meeting of 6 August 1872, during the discussion of his draft address 
(see Note 563), John Hales accused him of falsifying the information received 
from Spain. Engels' complaint was discussed at the Committee meeting in late 
August 1872; however, due to the Hague Congress and the subsequent transfer 
of the General Council to New York, the investigation of this matter was not 
completed.—421

658 Notes 
572 A reference to Danielson' s letter to Marx of 20-25 July (1-6 August) 
1872.—422 
573 Danielson sent Marx a copy of Nikolai Chernyshevsky's unpublished article 
'Letters Without an Address' written in 1862. Marx wanted to publish this work 
in Geneva with the help of Nikolai Utin. 'Letters Without an Address' was first 
published in 1874 in Zurich by Pyotr Lavrov. Marx showed great interest in the 
article and made a detailed synopsis.—422, 457 
574 A reference to the letter written by Sergei Nechayev to Nikolai Lyubavin in the 
spring of 1870 on Bakunin's instructions in the name of the non-existent 
Bureau of Foreign Agents of the Russian Revolutionary Society The People's 
Judgment In this letter, Lyubavin was threatened with reprisals if he did not 
release Bakunin from the commitments he had undertaken with regard to the 
translation of Volume I of Capital into Russian. (Under the agreement 
concluded through Lyubavin with the publisher Nikolai Polyakov, Bakunin was 
to receive 1,200 roubles for the translation, 300 roubles of which had been 
paid to him on account on 28 September 1869.) Nechayev's letter was 
forwarded to Marx by Lyubavin on 20 August 1872 and figured among the 
documents passed on by Marx and Engels to the committee appointed by the 
Hague Congress to inquire into the activities of the secret Alliance.—422, 452, 
455, 509, 523 
575 All that has survived of Engels' letter to Glaser de Willebrord is a long excerpt 
copied by Nikolai Zhukovsky from Glaser de Willebrord's letter to Désiré 
Brismée of 21 August 1872, in which he quoted the bulk of what Engels had 
written. The copy made by Zhukovsky was published by Nettlau in his 
lithographic biography of Bakunin (M. Nettlau, Michael Bakunin. Eine Bio­
graphie, Vol. Ill, Ch. 57, pp. 613-15) and, in an abridged form, by James 
Guillaume (J. Guillaume, L'Internationale. Documents et souvenirs (1864-1878), 
Vol. II, Société nouvelle de librairie et d'édition, Paris, 1907, pp. 318-19).—424 
576 The Rimini Conference (4-6 August 1872) was a conference of Italian anarchists 
which Bakunin helped prepare. A national Italian anarchist organisation was 
formed in Rimini which illegitimately assumed the name of the Italian 
Federation of the International. In a special resolution passed on 6 August the 
Conference declared that it was rupturing all solidarity with the General 
Council and urged the International's sections to send delegates to the 
separatist Bakuninist congress, scheduled for 2 September 1872 in Neuchâtel, 
rather than to the regular congress at The Hague. This divisive proposal was not 
backed by any of the sections of the International.—  424,  426 
577 A reference to the Union de las très clases de vapor (Union of the Three 
Categories of Factory Workers), one of the first trade unions in Catalonia, 
which embraced weavers, spinners and other workers employed in the textile 
industry. The Union was a collective member of the International.—425, 426 
578 In his letter to Engels of 18 August 1872 Liebknecht proposed that the former be 
nominated as a candidate in one of the Saxonian constituencies at the next 
elections to the Reichstag.— 426 
579 In a private circular of 7 July 1872 the Spanish Federal Council, which was 
dominated by the Bakuninists, suggested that all sections elect a delegation to 
the Hague Congress from a single list, and that a binding mandate be drawn 
up. As a result the Spanish Federation sent four Bakuninists as its delegates to

the Hague Congress (Tomas Morago Gonzalez, Nicola Marselau, Alonso 
Charles Alerini and Rafael Farga Pellicer).—426 
580 On 19 July 1872 at the meeting of the General Council Executive Committee 
(Sub-Committee; see Note 435), Engels was instructed to prepare the financial 
report for the Hague Congress covering the period since the London 
Conference in September 1871. The report was read out by Engels at the 
Hague Congress sitting of 7 September 1872, and unanimously approved. 
Marx and Engels arrived at The Hague to take part in the Congress on 
1 September 1872. On 8 September they travelled to Amsterdam, where they 
took part in the meeting marking the closure of the Congress. Engels returned 
to London on 12 September, and Marx around 17 September 1872. 
The Fifth Congress of the International Working Men's Association was 
held on 2-7 September 1872 in The Hague and attended by 65 delegates from 
15 national organisations. Its decision to include in the General Rules (as 
Article 7a) the major tenet on the conquest of political power by the proletariat, 
and its resolutions relating to Administrative Regulations signified a victory for 
Marxism. The Congress took stock of the struggle Marx, Engels and their 
followers had waged for years against petty-bourgeois sectarianism in the 
workers' movement, in whatever guise it appeared, most notably against 
Bakuninism; Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume, the anarchist leaders, 
were expelled from the International. The resolutions of the Hague Congress 
laid the groundwork for the future formation of independent political parties 
of the working class on a national level.—427, 430, 438, 450, 460, 475, 489, 491, 
513, 523, 525, 526, 582, 584, 586 
581 This letter has survived as a certified handwritten copy made from the original 
by John Burns, a leading figure in the British workers' movement, among 
whose papers it is kept at the British Museum Library. The copy of the letter is 
dated 15 September 1872, which may be incorrect. The letter is likely to have 
been written somewhat later, since it deals with the international Federalist 
Congress which took place in London on 16-19 September 1872. However, it is 
possible that having learned in advance about the convocation and agenda of 
the congress, Engels decided to give a description of its participants prior to its 
opening.—428 
582 On 16-19 September 1872 the New Hall of Science, 142 Old Street, City Road, 
E.C., London (the headquarters of a group of radicals headed by Charles 
Bradlaugh), hosted an international congress convened by petty-bourgeois 
federalists as a gesture against the Hague Congress of the International (see 
Note 580). Its agenda was published in the Federation, No. 4, 14 September 
1872.—428 
583 The society of French refugees refers to the French-Language Section in London 
(see Note 359). 
The above-mentioned (third) trial of members of the Paris Federation of 
the International took place in Paris between 22 June and 5 July 1870. Legal 
proceedings were instituted against 38 members of the International Working 
Men's Association. In the course of the trial, the attempts by the Bonapartist 
authorities to accuse them of involvement in a plot to assassinate Napoleon III 
collapsed. Nevertheless, the accused were given prison sentences and fined.—

within the International. On the proposal put by Marx and other delegates, the 
sitting of 5 September appointed a special committee to inquire into the secret 
activities of the Alliance. Its members were Theodor Cuno, Roch Splingard, 
Lucain (Frédéric Potel), Paul Vichard and Walter (L. Van Heddeghem). On 5 and 
6 September the Congress heard the evidence given by Marx, Wroblewski, 
Dupont, Serraillier, Guillaume, Zhukovsky, Morago Gonzalez, Marselau, 
Alerini, and Farga Pellicer. Engels submitted to the committee a report on the 
Alliance (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 228-38). 
Due to the torrent of incoming documents and a large volume of evidence, 
the committee could not complete the investigation but, on the basis of the 
material it had managed to examine, arrived at the conclusion that the Alliance 
was incompatible with the International, and on 7 September submitted a 
proposal to the Congress that Bakunin, Guillaume, Schwitzguébel, Malon, 
Marchand, and Bousquet be expelled from the International Working Men's 
Association. (The committee's report was later published in La Liberie, No. 42, 
20 October 1872.) The Congress adopted the proposal on the expulsion of 
Bakunin and Guillaume, and passed a decision to make public the documents 
on the Alliance the committee had at its disposal. The committee, however, was 
unable to carry through this decision. The documents were sent to Marx and 
Engels in London and formed the basis for the pamphlet The Alliance of 
Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association (see 
Note 623).—430, 455, 460 
The Declaration of the minority (Déclaration de la minorité), a statement read out 
at the Congress sitting of 7 September by Victor Dave and signed by 
13 anarchist delegates (four from Spain, five from Belgium, two from 
Switzerland and two from Holland), and also by the representative of New 
York Section No. 12 which the Congress had expelled from the International 
(see Note 332). 
The statement rejected Congress decisions aimed at strengthening discipline 
and promoting centralisation within the International, and declared the 
'autonomy' and 'independence' of the sections to be the basic principle. The 
minority declared that they would recognise the General Council only as a 
correspondence and statistical bureau. The statement by the anarchist minority 
was a step towards an open split in the International Working Men's 
Association.—430 
On 6 September 1872 Marx and Engels proposed, on behalf of a large group 
of the General Council members, that the Council be transferred to New York 
for 1872-73. The proposal was prompted by the fact that the situation in 
Europe was unfavourable for the Council's work, and the danger that if it 
remained in London it may pass into the hands of French Blanquist émigrés, 
prone to adventurist and conspiratorial tactics, or of English reformists. 
Following a lively discussion, the Congress accepted this proposal by a majority 
vote and elected 12 members of the International of different nationalities to 
the future Council in the USA, granting them the right to co-opt three more 
members.—430 
A reference to the resolution of the Hague Congress passed at its eighth sitting 
on 5 September 1872; it was not included into the official edition of the Hague 
Congress resolutions.—430 
The first sittings of the Hague Congress were devoted to discussing the 
delegates' mandates. The results of the discussion were incorporated into a

number of resolutions passed by the Congress, notably into resolutions of 
Section IV (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 246-48). 
The official version of the Hague Congress resolutions was written and 
edited by Marx and Engels, who were on the committee (together with Eugène 
Dupont, Léo Frankel, Auguste Serraillier and Benjamin Le Moussu) appointed 
to prepare the Congress minutes and resolutions for publication. The official 
edition appeared in November 1872 in French as a separate pamphlet; on 
14 December 1872, The International  Herald,  No. 37, carried the official English 
version.—430, 437, 441 
589 The minutes of the Hague Congress were not published in Marx's and Engels' 
lifetime.—430 
590 At the British Federal Council meeting of 12 September 1872, John Hales, the 
Council Chairman, who was supported by the reformist majority, managed to 
have Marx reprimanded for the speech he had made at the Hague Congress 
on 3 September in defence of the mandate of Maltman Barry, a member of the 
British Federation. In his speech, Marx accused those who called themselves 
the British workers' leaders of having more or less sold out to the bourgeoisie 
and the government. Many sections within the British Federation protested 
against this decision by the Federal Council.—431, 436, 462 
591 On 19 September 1872 a strike was launched at all Lisbon foundries, which was 
joined by carpenters, caulkers, and workers in other trades, who demanded 
shorter working hours. The strike was supported by the Portuguese Federation 
of the International. 
On 17-18 September the Lisbon Federal Council wrote a letter to the British 
Federal Council (c/o Engels), requesting it to act without delay to prevent strike 
breakers being brought to Portugal from Britain.—434, 439, 440 
592 This is a reply to van der Willigen's letter of 2 October 1872 in which the 
Dutch reporter asked Marx when and where the official account of the Hague 
Congress would be published. The original of Marx's letter is kept at 
Karl-Marx-Haus in Trier.—434 
593 On 15 September 1872 an extraordinary congress of the Jura Federation was 
held in Saint-Imier, Switzerland, with 16 delegates attending. The congress voted 
down the resolutions of the Hague Congress; a report on it was printed by the 
Bulletin de la Federation jurassienne, Nos. 17 and 18, 15 September-1 October 
1872. 
The Jura Federation congress was held immediately before an anarchist 
congress in Saint-Imier, which likewise opposed the decisions of the Hague 
Congress (see Note 599).—435, 441, 450 
594 This is a reference to Article 1 of the Administrative Regulations adopted in 
1866 by the Geneva Congress of the International (see present edition, Vol. 20, 
p. 444).—436 
595 Engels ironically applied the name Sonderbund (a separate union) to the 
emerging bloc of anarchists and their supporters who opposed the decisions of 
the Hague Congress. The original Sonderbund was a separatist association of 
reactionary Swiss Catholic cantons that existed in the 1840s.—436, 453 
596 On the decision of German Section No. 6 (New York), Engels represented it at 
the Hague Congress. The above-mentioned report he wrote has not been 
found.—436

597 The pamphlet Les théoriciens du socialisme en Allemagne. Extrait du Journal des 
Economistes, Paris, 1872, was a review by Maurice Block of Volume I of 
Capital. A copy with Marx's marginal notes is extant. Marx gave his opinion of 
the pamphlet in his letter to Nikolai Danielson of 18 January 1873 (see this 
volume, p. 470).—438 
598 Reviews of the Russian edition of Volume I of Capital were featured by 
Peterburgskiye Vedomosti, No. 97, 8 (20) April 1872; Novoye Vremya, No. 106, 
23 April (5 May) 1872; Birzheviye Vedomosti No. 147, 30 May 1872. Syn 
Otecheslva, Nos. 97 and 98, 28 and 29 April 1872, carried the article 'The 
Teachings of Modern Socialism and Communism'; Otechestvenniye Zapiski, No. 4, 
April 1872, printed the article 'Concerning the Russian Edition of Karl Marx's 
BookJ written by N. K. Mikhailovsky and published anonymously. Reviews of 
Capital also appeared in other Russian periodicals.— 438 
599 On 15-16 September an extraordinary congress of organisations comprising the 
Bakuninist Alliance was held in Saint-Imier, Switzerland. The congress decided 
not to recognise the resolutions of the Hague Congress and the powers of the 
General Council. It concluded the 'Pacte d'amitié de solidarité et de défense 
mutuelle' for the purpose of campaigning against the federations and sections 
of the International Working Men's Association which supported the decisions 
of the Fifth Congress at The Hague. The anarchist congress also adopted a 
special resolution rejecting political struggle on the part of the working class 
and denying the need to establish an independent proletarian political party. 
The congress issued an address to the sections of the International urging 
them to convene, six months later, an 'anti-authoritarian' congress.—  441,  448, 
475 
600 In his letter, John Hales proposed the establishment of direct contacts between 
the British and the Belgian federation and accused the old General Council of 
'authoritarianism'. This was in fact a declaration of support for the anarchists' 
campaign against the General Council.—441 
601 The Lafargues arrived in London from The Hague, where they had gone from 
Spain to attend the International's congress.—442, 443 
602 This is a reply to Jenny Marx-Longuet's letter of 27 October 1872. Thanking 
Engels for sending her two issues of La Emancipacion with a critical article 
about Proudhon, Jenny wrote that 'Proudhon's unworthy disciple and mutual 
friend of ours' had read it with a bitter smile, which was a hint at Charles 
Longuet. —442 
603 The wedding of Jenny Marx and the French socialist Charles Longuet took 
place on 10 October 1872. The newly weds settled in Oxford.—442 
604 A reference to the various groups of French refugees in London. 
The 'purs' are the Blanquists headed by Edouard Marie Vaillant. In 
November 1872 the Blanquists issued a pamphlet Internationale et révolution 
aimed against the decision of the Hague Congress to transfer the seat of the 
General Council to New York, in which they accused the leaders of the 
International of having renounced the idea of revolution. The pamphlet was 
signed by Armand Arnaud, Frederic Cournet, Edouard Margueritte, Constant 
Martin, Gabriel Ranvier and Edouard Vaillant, who simultaneously stated that 
they were withdrawing from the International. However, as Eugène Dupont

informed Marx on 6 November 1872, Ranvier was unaware that his name had 
been used. 
The 'impurs' are probably a group of French refugees headed by Pierre 
Vésinier and Bernard Landeck.— 443, 447, 458, 467 
605 Knoten (boors, louts, yokels), a label Marx and Engels often used in their letters 
to describe the members of the German Workers' Educational Society in 
London. The subject of Marx's lecture has not been established.—443 
606 Associazione degli opérai e degli agricoltori della Bassa Lombardia (Association of 
Workers and Agricultural Labourers of Lower Lombardy), the International's 
section in Lodi, and Consociazione dei liberi Lavoratori Abruzzesi (Society of Free 
Abruzzi Labourers), the International's section in L'Aquila, were both formed 
in October 1872 under the direct influence of Enrico Bignami. Bignami 
informed Engels of their formation and the adoption of appropriate Rules on 
28 October 1872. On 22 December 1872 the New York General Council 
admitted these sections to the International on Engels' application. In 
December 1872-January 1873 their activities were banned by the government.— 
444 
607 Engels is referring to the announcement, printed by La Plebe, No. 112, on 
26 October 1872, of the forthcoming publication as a separate pamphlet of the 
report on the Hague Congress (which was probably the above-mentioned article 
by Engels 'The Congress at The Hague') together with the General Rules 
containing the amendments introduced by the Congress. Bignami failed to 
publish the pamphlet.—445 
608 Friedrich Adolph Sorge was co-opted on to the New York General Council and 
elected its General Secretary on 11 October 1872. Writing to Marx about this on 
12 October, Sorge outlined his plan for reorganising the work at the 
Council. He suggested that all correspondence should be the responsibility of 
the General Secretary, at the same time he proposed that for a number of 
countries authorised representatives be appointed by the General Council, 
predominantly from among the corresponding secretaries of the old Council. 
The new structure was approved by the General Council.—445 
609 At Engels' request, Sorge brought with him to the Congress the handwritten 
text of a French translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, which 
had been prepared in the summer of 1872 by a Frenchman residing in the 
USA. The translator had used the English edition of the Manifesto in Woodhull 
& Claflin's Weekly (see Note 440).—446, 451 
610 The reference is to the 'Address of the General Council. To the federations, 
affiliated societies, sections and all members of the International Working 
Men's Association. New York, October 20 th 1872', the first official Address of 
the new General Council. It was published in The International  Herald,  No. 34, 
on 23 November 1872.—446 
611 In June 1872 the Democratic Association of Victoria was established in Australia 
and announced that it was joining the International Working Men's Associa­
tion.—446 
612 The Bakuninist Spanish Federal Council issued a private circular which 
announced the convocation of a congress in Cordoba earlier than scheduled 
and arbitrarily changed the agenda, demanding that a choice be made between 
the resolutions of the Hague Congress and those of the anarchist congress in 
Saint-Imier. In this connection, on 1 November 1872, the New Madrid

Federation issued an Address, 'La Nueva Federaciön madrilena â todas las 
federaciones, secciones é individuos de la Asociaciôn Internacional en Espafia', 
which was signed 'Victor Pages' and published in La Emancipation, No. 73, 
9 November 1872. The authors of the Address proposed the election of a new 
Federal Council which would act in conformity with the International's Rules 
and the resolutions of its General Congresses. 
The Nueva Federation madrilena (New Madrid Federation) was founded on 
8 July 1872 by the members of the Emancipation editorial board expelled from 
the Madrid Federation by its anarchist majority. An important part in the 
foundation and work of the Federation was performed by Paul Lafargue. On 
15 August 1872 the General Council recognised it as an equal member of the 
International (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 215). The New Madrid Federa­
tion resolutely opposed the anarchist influence in Spain and spread the ideas of 
scientific socialism.— 447 
618 The Cercle d'Études Sociales (Circle for Social Studies) was set up in London by 
refugee Communards in late 1871-early 1872 with the active participation by 
the French-speaking section formed in London in October 1871. International 
members Gabriel Ranvier, Hippolyte Lissagaray and Adolphe Hubert contri­
buted greatly to the work in the Cercle. On their suggestion, Marx was 
unanimously admitted to the Cercle on 3 February 1872 and took part in its 
work until the autumn of that year.—447 
614 A reference to the private 'Circular â todas las federaciones locales' issued in 
1872 in Valencia by the Bakuninist Spanish Federal Council. It called for an 
extraordinary congress of the Federation with a view to declaring its agreement 
with the decisions of the Bakuninist congress in Saint-Imier. The circular 
included the report of the four Spanish delegates to the Hague Congress, which 
had originally appeared in La Federation, No. 162, on 21 September 1872.— 
448, 474 
615 A general assembly of the Gratia Federation was held on 4-6 November 1872. 
Having heard the report on the Hague Congress delivered by Charles Alerini, 
one of the leaders of the Alliance, the assembly censured the attitude of the 
Spanish delegates at the Congress, rejected the anarchists' proposal to support 
the resolutions of the Saint-Imier congress and approved by a majority vote the 
resolutions of the Hague Congress. 
The meeting of the Valencia Federation was held on 9 November 1872. It 
voted down the Alliancists' proposal to include the demand that the Saint-Imier 
resolutions be approved in the binding mandate given to the delegate to an 
extraordinary congress in Cordoba (see Note 627).—448 
616 Engels learned about the success in the struggle against the Alliance in Spain 
from José Mesa. Presumably Mesa had enclosed with his letter the information 
received from Francisco Mora, who was in Barcelona at the time.—449 
617 The article, probably written by Mesa on the basis of materials sent over by 
Lafargue or Engels, gave an account of Sergei Nechayev's activities in Russia, 
and also of attempts by Spanish members of the Alliance to beat up Mora and 
Anselmo Lorenzo.—449 
618 The International  Herald,  No. 33, 16 November 1872 featured a report, signed 
by John Hales, on the meeting of the British Federal Council held on 7 
November.—449 
619 By the General Council decision of 5 January 1873, Engels was appointed

temporary representative of the Council for Italy and received the appropriate 
powers and instructions.—450 
620 Marx stayed with Jenny and Charles Longuet in Oxford between 15 and 
18 November 1872.—450 
621 By a decision of 22 December 1872, Auguste Serraillier, who in 1871 and 1872 
was Corresponding Secretary of the London Council for France, was appointed 
temporary representative of the General Council for France, and received his 
mandate and instructions.—450, 455, 458 
622 -phe Spanish translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx's and 
Engels' preface to the 1872 German edition was done by Mesa and printed by 
La Emancipation, Nos. 72-77, 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 November and 7 December 
1872.  Mesa translated from the French version published in Le Socialiste (see 
Note 440) and sent to him by Engels, who had partially revised and corrected 
it. Engels also used the manuscript brought by Friedrich Adolph Sorge to the 
Hague Congress (see Note 609).—450 
623 Since the committee appointed by the Hague Congress to inquire into the 
secret activities of the Alliance did not manage to examine the bulk of the 
documents submitted to it (see Note 584), Marx had the idea back at the time 
of the Congress of writing an exposure of the Bakuninist organisation. The 
Hague Congress decided to publish the documents pertaining to the Alliance 
(see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 249-50). The documents were passed on to 
the committee appointed to prepare the Congress minutes and resolutions for 
publication, which included Marx and Engels among its members. In April 1873 
they started work on The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International 
Working Men's Association, as the Congress had resolved. The bulk of the work 
involved in the collection of additional material, its comparison and analysis was 
carried out by Engels and Paul Lafargue. The concluding part of the pamphlet 
was written by Marx (see this volume, p. 521). The pamphlet appeared in 
French in late August-early September 1873 (see present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 454-580). In the summer of 1874 it was published in German in Brunswick 
in Samuel Kokosky's translation entitled Ein Complot gegen die Internationale 
Arbeiter-Association.—451, 517, 523 
624 Sergei Nechayev, who was living in Zurich at the time, was arrested on 
14 August 1872 by the Swiss authorities and in the autumn of the same year 
extradited to Russia as a criminal. Sentenced to 20 years' hard labour, 
Nechayev was kept at the Alexeyevsky Ravelin of the Peter and Paul Fortress in 
St Petersburg where he died ten years later.—452 
625 A reference to the Irish sections of the International Working Men's 
Association in the USA. Their members were mostly former Fenians (see 
Note 6).—453 
626 A reference to the congress of a number of the Dutch sections of the 
International held in Amsterdam on 24 November 1872. It was convened by 
the Dutch Federal Council as a response to the anarchist campaign against the 
resolutions of the Hague Congress.—453 
627 The congress in Cordoba, attended only by Spanish anarchists (48 delegates), 
took place on 25 December 1872-2 January 1873. The congress rejected the 
resolutions of the Hague Congress and the General Rules of the International 
Working Men's Association, disbanded the Federal Council and replaced it with

a federal commission with severely restricted powers. It also aligned itself with 
the resolutions of the international anarchist congress in Saint-Imier (see 
Note 599), which were hostile to the International. 
On the Address of the New Madrid Federation, see Note 612.—454, 465, 
475,  494, 520 
628 On 25 December 1872 a private conference of the International Working 
Men's Association's branches in Southern France was held in Toulouse and 
attended by delegates from Toulouse, Montpellier, Bordeaux, Béziers, Sète, 
Agen, Narbonne, Bayonne, Avignon, Castelnaudary, Lavardac, Perpignan, etc. 
The conference was to endorse the resolutions of the Hague Congress and put 
up a fight against the Bakuninists. These plans, however, were foiled by arrests 
of the International's members, which began at that time in Southern 
France.—454, 466 
629 Engels is referring to Jules Montels' letter protesting at the expulsion from the 
International's Béziers section of anarchist Abel Bousquet, a police officer. The 
letter was published in Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne, No. 20-21, 
10 November 1872.—454 
630 in conformity with the agreement signed by the publisher and proprietor of 
The International Herald William Riley and the British Federal Council, from 
11 May 1872 (No. 6) the paper functioned as the Council's official organ. It 
was at Marx's suggestion that Riley broke the agreement on 30 November 1872 
and refused to give the reformist majority of the British Council an 
opportunity to use the newspaper against the General Council. After the 
revolutionary wing of the British Federal Council formed a new Council in late 
December 1872 (see Note 643), the paper resumed its functions as the 
Council's mouthpiece. 
The Hague Congress resolutions were published in The International  Herald, 
No. 37, 14 December 1872. Reports on the International's activities on the 
Continent written by Engels were published between mid-January and 
mid-February 1873 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 409-13).—454, 460 
631 On 30 December 1872 the General Council in New York authorised Marx to 
collect all property whatsoever of the late General Council of the I.W.M.A. and 
'hold the same subject to the order of the General Council'.—455 
632 At Danielson's request Marx sent him the resolutions of the Hague Congress of 
1872 (see Note 588).—455 
633 -phe beating up of Nikolai Utin (Outine) by members of the Alliance's Slav 
Section, which was to prevent him from completing the report he was writing 
for the Hague Congress on Bakunin's splitting activities, is described by Marx 
and Engels in The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working 
Men's Association (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 485).—456 
634 Writing to Marx on 21 November (3 December) 1872, Danielson quoted a 
letter from Lopatin in which the latter reported that he had managed to escape 
from exile in Irkutsk but had been rearrested in Tomsk and returned to Irkutsk. 
It is possible that Marx intended to try and get him released through the British 
diplomat David Urquhart, with whom he maintained friendly relations.—456, 
469 
635 A reference to the manuscript of the article by the Russian bourgeois economist 
Yuli Zhukovsky, 'Karl Marx and His Book about Capital', which was

subsequently published in Vestnik Yevropy, Vol. V, September 1877, pp. 64-195. 
A critical review of this article by an ideologist of Russian Narodism (Populism) 
Nikolai Mikhailovsky, which appeared in the Otechestvenniye Zapiski magazine in 
October 1877 ('Karl Marx Before the Tribunal of Mr Zhukovsky'), prompted 
Marx to write a 'Letter to Otechestvenniye Zapiski' (see present edition, 
Vol. 24).—457 
636 Marx is referring to the intention of Napoléon La Cecilia, a Communard and 
member of the International, and Enrico Bignami, editor of La Ptebe, to 
translate and publish Capital in Italian. However, they did not succeed in 
carrying out this plan.—457 
637 In a letter of 15 (27) December 1872 Danielson outlined a basis for Lafargue's 
work for Russian magazines, including Znaniye, and asked him to send a trial 
article. Fruitful cooperation between the Russian magazines Ustoi, Otechestvenniye 
Zapiski and Seventy Vestnik and Lafargue began only in the 1880s.—457, 
469 
638 Marx intended to use the results of his research into agrarian relations in 
Russia in the section devoted to rent (in accordance with his plan, in the second 
book of Volume II of Capital). After Marx's death Engels published the first 
and second books of this volume as Volumes II and III of Capital.— 457 
639 Marx's intention to write Nikolai Chernyshevsky's biography or an essay about 
him remained unfulfilled since Danielson failed to obtain necessary informa­
tion.—457, 469 
640 Engels is referring to the article probably written by José Mesa, who drew on 
the materials he had been sent by Lafargue or Engels himself.—458 
641 On 21 November 1872 the Royal prosecutor in Lodi announced that issue 
No. 118 of La Plebe of 17 November 1872 had been sequestrated for 
publishing the General Council's Address of 20 October (see Note 610). 
Prosecutor Gerli simultaneously announced that proceedings had been insti­
tuted against Enrico Bignami, the paper's editor. In December 1872 Bignami 
and three of his friends were arrested and charged with high treason and 
propagating the ideas of the International Working Men's Association.—458, 
466,  518 
642 Bignami's arrest and the sequestration of issue No. 118 of La Plebe were 
reported in Der Volksstaat, No. 101, 18 December 1872. The paper probably 
used the information supplied by Engels. 
La Emancipation did not carry the report.—458 
643 After the Hague Congress the reformist wing of the British Federal Council 
refused to recognise the Congress resolutions. To counter the reformists' actions, 
the revolutionary wing of the Council (Samuel Vickery, William Riley, 
George Milner, Frederick Lessner, Eugène Dupont and others) vigorously 
supported Marx and Engels. In early December 1872 a split occurred; the 
wing of the Council that remained loyal to the Hague Congress resolutions was 
established as the British Federal Council in late December 1872. 
The British Federal Council existed until early 1874.—459, 464, 498

645 By a decision of 2 February 1872, Walery Wröblewski, who from October 1871 
and throughout 1872 had been Corresponding Secretary for Poland of the 
London General Council, was appointed representative for Poland by the New 
York General Council.—460

647 The reference is to the reply by John Hales to Marx's and Engels' letter of 
20 December 1872 to the editor of The International  Herald,  which exposed the 
divisive activities of the reformist wing of the British Federal Council. Hales' 
reply written on 30 December was published in The International  Herald, 
No. 40, 4 January 1873. 'Our reply' is a reference to the 'Address of the British 
Federal Council to the Sections, Branches, Affiliated Societies and Members' 
adopted at the Federal Council meeting of 23 December (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, pp. 309-14). It was written by Marx and distributed as a leaflet signed 
by ten Council members in response to the reformist circular of 10 De­
cember.—461 
648 A reference to the circular addressed by Hales to a number of London 
workers' societies on 21 December 1872, which contained slanderous attacks on 
the revolutionary wing of the British Federal Council. The circular was

650 A reference to Gustave Cluseret's article 'L'Internationale et la Dictature' 
spearheaded against the Blanquist pamphlet Internationale et révolution (see 
Note 604). The article was printed by LÉgalité, Nos. 22 and 23, 18 December 
1872.—464. 
651 The Manchester Foreign Section of the International Working Men's Association 
was formed in August 1872, mostly of emigrant workers. It resolutely opposed 
the reformist wing of the British Federal Council and supported Marx's and 
Engels' efforts to strengthen the British Federation and purge it of the 
elements that were disorganising its work. The circular mentioned by Engels 
was written by him at the request of the Manchester section in reply to the 
circular of 10 December 1872 drawn up by the reformist wing which had 
seceded from the British Federal Council. After the section had approved it, 
Engels' circular was published as a leaflet and sent to all members of the 
International in Great Britain (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 304-08).—464 
652 The congress, which was convened by the reformist wing of the British Federal 
Council, took place in London on 26 January 1873. Attended by 12 delegates 
only, it refused to recognise the resolutions of the Hague Congress. The 
Federal Council set up by the secessionists ceased to meet as early as the spring 
of 1873; the sections that had supported it either fell apart or rejoined the 
British Federation.—464, 485, 494 
65S On 25-26 December 1872 a regular congress of the Belgian Federation was

held in Brussels, with the anarchists in the majority. The congress refused to 
recognise the resolutions of the Hague Congress or to maintain contacts with 
the General Council in New York, and voiced support for the resolutions of the 
anarchist congress in Saint-Imier (see Note 599).—465, 475 
654 In a letter to Engels of 29 December 1872, José Mesa informed him of the 
putsch launched by extremist groups of republican federalists in Madrid 
towards the end of 1872. He wrote that the participation in the putsch of many 
of the Internationals, who had joined in at the anarchists' instigation, had 
serious repercussions for the organisation in Spain.—465 
655 -phe Strike that affected jewellers' workshops in Geneva began in late 
November 1872 and lasted late into April 1873. The strikers demanded a 
nine-hour working day. At the request of the Romance Federal Council, the 
General Council appealed to the International's sections and federations to 
extend support to the striking jewellers. The latter received 49,000 francs from 
different countries, which enabled them to hold on. The strike ended in victory 
for the workers.—466 
656 Engels is referring to the strike by 3,000 Geneva building workers in March 
and April 1868. The workers were demanding a reduction in the working day 
to ten hours, a pay rise, and payment by the hour instead of by the day. The 
victory of workers in Geneva was made possible by the solidarity campaign 
organised by the General Council and involving their British, French and 
German counterparts.—466 
657 A reference to the address of the General Council to the Jura Federation 
issued on 8 November 1872, warning it that if it refused to revoke the 
resolutions of its congress in Saint-Imier (see Note 593) it would be suspended 
from the International pending the next General Congress. Implied also is the 
General Council address to the forthcoming Belgian congress issued on 
1 December 1872, which urged the Belgian workers to consolidate the unity of 
the International Working Men's Association.—467 
658 In a letter of 6 December 1872 Sorge wrote to Engels that the General Council 
had decided to grant temporary powers for Paris to Walter (L. Van 
Heddeghem), and for Toulouse to Ferdinand Argaing.—467 
669 In a letter to Engels of 6 December 1872 Sorge wrote that against his advice, 
Theodor Cuno had turned down a job paying $75 a month, considering this to 
be too little. As a result, he had been forced to content himself with a job at a 
machine-building factory at less than half that wage.—468

21 January 1873, in which he acknowledged receipt of all materials posted by 
Engels to Der Volksstaat.— 468

662 A reference to the scores of Glinka's operas Life for the Tsar (Ivan Susanin) and 
Ruslan and Lyudmila sent, back in early 1871, by Danielson to Marx's eldest 
daughter Jenny at the request of Hermann Lopatin. The sender's name was 
not on the parcel, and became known to the Marx family only from Danielson's 
letter of 15 (27) December 1872.—469 
663 Marx is referring to the letter requesting written contributions which he

'A. Sleptsov' and sent at the end of 1870.—469 
664 A reference to Nikolai Lyubavin's letter about Sergei Nechayev's threats. 
Nechayev demanded that Bakunin be released from his obligation to translate 
Volume I of Capital (see Note 574).—469 
665 Marx is referring to the open letter sent to La Liberté by a group of Russian 
émigrés in Switzerland who were closely associated with Bakunin (Woldemar 
Holstein, Barthélémy Zaizev, Alexander Oelsnitz, Nikolai Ogarev, Vladimir 
Ozerov, Zemphiri Ralli, A. Ross, Valerian Smirnov). The letter, written on 
4 October 1872, protested against Bakunin's expulsion from the International. 
It was printed by La Liberté, No. 41, on 13 October 1872.—469 
666 This is Marx's reply to Bolte's letter of 22 January 1873. Having received 
information from Friedrich Adolph Sorge about his disagreements with 
some members of the General Council, notably Bolte, regarding the divisive 
activities of anarchists and British reformists, Marx outlines here the stand 
to be taken by the Council. Under Marx's influence, Bolte supported Sorge 
when the General Council resolution of 30 May 1873 was being worked out. 
It declared all organisations and individuals refusing to recognise the resolu­
tions of the Hague Congress to have placed themselves outside the Interna­
tional.

established in New York, and to the bulletin of the US Federal Council, which 
was to appear in English. The latter was never published.—474 
668 The  congress of the secessionist part of the British Federation (see Note 652), 
was attended by Bennet, Dunn, Eccarius, Foster, Grout, Hales, Jung, Mac Ara, 
Pape, Roberts, Seaman and Weston.—474 
669 A reference to the General Council resolution of 5 January 1873, which 
announced the suspension of the Jura Federation pending the next regular 
congress of the International, since this organisation had rejected the 
resolutions of the Hague Congress.—475 
670 On 15-17 March 1873 the Second Congress of the so-called Italian Federation 
of the International was held in Bologna and attracted representatives from 
153 anarchist sections. The congress decided to unconditionally support the 
resolutions of the conference in Rimini (see Note 576) and the Saint-Imier 
congress (see Note 599), and to reject the Hague Congress resolutions.—475,494 
671 A congress of anarchist and reformist organisations within the International, 
which had refused to abide by the resolutions of the Hague Congress, was held 
in Geneva on 1-6 September 1873. Its organiser was the Bakuninist Geneva 
Section of Propaganda and Revolutionary Socialist Action (see Note 339). 
Having declared rejection of all authority as the basic principle of the 
international anarchist association, the congress abolished the General Council, 
revoked the right of congresses to pass any definite decisions on issues of 
principle, and removed from the General Rules Article 7a on the political 
action by the working class.—475, 524, 525, 528, 537

672 A reference to the next regular congress of the International scheduled for 
September 1873. 
The 6th Congress of the International Working Men's Association was held 
in Geneva between 8 and 13 September 1873. Of the 31 delegates present at 
the Congress, 28 were representatives of the International's Swiss branches or 
its émigré sections in Switzerland. When considering the General Rules, the 
majority headed by Johann Philipp Becker endorsed the decisions of the 
Hague Congress of 1872 on extending the functions of the General Council 
(against opposition from Henri Perret and a number of other Swiss delegates). 
The Congress stressed the need for the working class to engage in political 
struggle. New York was left as the General Council's headquarters until the 
next Congress scheduled for 1875. The Geneva Congress of 1873 was the last 
congress of the International Working Men's Association.—475, 489, 492, 507, 
525, 526, 528, 534, 537 
673 This is Engels' reply to Liebknecht's letter of 8 February 1873 written from the 
Hubertusburg fortress where he had been imprisoned. The letter outlined a 
plan to publish a popular 'social and political library', which was to open with 
Thomas More's Utopia. It was also to comprise a number of Marx's and 
Engels' works. Liebknecht was making enquiries as to their reprinting. No such 
library, however, was established in the 1870s.—477 
674 On 8 February 1873 Liebknecht wrote to Engels that Der Volksstaat was as yet 
unable to devote much space to the polemics inside the International. On 
27 February 1873, replying to Engels' demand for an explanation of this, 
Liebknecht wrote that he had had in mind the paper's limited space and its 
difficult position following the arrest of its editors.— 477 
675 The draft of this letter, written in Lafargue's hand, was drawn up as a reply to 
Lachâtre's letter to Engels of 14 February 1873, probably soon after its receipt. 
In his letter, Lachâtre suggested that Engels write a short biography of Marx, 
which he intended to include in the French edition of Volume I of Capital, 
undertaken by his publishing house. This plan did not materialise.— 478 
676 Between May 1850 and July 1862 Liebknecht lived in exile in London, while 
Engels resided (from November 1850) in Manchester.—480 
677 Between 10 and 25 March 1873 a major trial of members of the International's 
French sections was held in Toulouse. Its organisers made wide use of the 
evidence received from Emile Dentraygues, a member of the Toulouse section, 
who gave information about the composition and activities of nearly all the 
International's sections in Southern France. Twenty-two out of the 
38 defendants were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment; Charles 
Larroque, a representative of the General Council who had managed to escape 
to Spain under an alias of Mortimer Latraque, was sentenced to three years' 
imprisonment in absentia. Apart from Toulouse, trials of the arrested members 
of the International were held in other towns of Southern France, including 
Cannes, Béziers, Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier, and Avignon.—482, 507 
678 Following the Hague Congress, Theodor Cuno emigrated to the USA; involved 
in the campaign against anarchism, he signed the Address to the New Madrid 
Federation, issued by the International's Section No. 29 on 10 January 1873, 
using an alias, F. Capestro.—482

trade unions (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 245-46), the General Council on 
26 January drafted rules for an international association, which Sorge sent to 
Engels on 12 February 1873. The draft rules were published in The 
International  Herald,  No. 49, 8 March 1873.—483 
680 Under the resolution issued by the New York General Council on 26 January 
1873,  all organisations and individuals who refused to comply with the 
decisions of the Hague Congress thereby placed themselves outside the 
International Working Men's Association. Later, on 30 May, the General 
Council passed a new resolution which listed the federations, sections and 
individuals who had placed themselves outside the International.—483, 488, 
493 
681 A reference to the General Council Address to the Spanish workers issued on 
23 February 1873, the day a republic was proclaimed in Spain. The General 
Council warned the Spanish workers against being carried away by bourgeois 
republican ideas and urged them to work for proletarian unity in order to build 
'a republic of labour and social democracy'.— 483 
682 On 22 December 1872 the General Council decided that the stamps pasted on 
the members' personal copies of the International's Rules as a sign that they 
had paid their dues (see Note 420) would be printed in London. The plates 
were to be made by Benjamin Le Moussu, a professional engraver. Engels was 
requested to supervise their production.— 484, 492 
683 The draft 0f this letter, written in Lafargue's hand, is a reply to Lachatre's 
letter of 16 March 1873 and has been dated on the basis of the postmark 
(21 March) stamped on the day of the latter's arrival in London.— 486 
684 The article 'Karl Marx', together with a portrait of the 'head of the 
International', was carried by the Paris weekly L'Illustration on 11 November 
1871.  It consisted of a biographical section, written by one of Marx's associates, 
and an introduction and conclusion by Eugène Vermersch, a petty-bourgeois 
journalist, who was largely hostile to Marxism. It is most probable that the 
biographical section was written by Engels. — 486 
685 -phe dispute between Boris Chicherin and Ivan Belyaev on the origins of the 
Russian commune was opened by Chicherin's article 'A Review of Historical 
Development of the Village Commune in Russia' published by Russky Vestnik, 
Vol. I, 1856, and a critical review of this article written by Belyaev and featured in 
Book One of Russkaya Beseda, 1856. Belyaev argued against Chicherin's 
idea that communal landownership, which still existed in Russia in the 19th 
century, had its roots in the taxation system of the Russian serf-owning state 
and was not a remnant of the ancient form of communal peasant pro­
perty.— 487 
686 In his work Die Abschaffung des privaten Grundeigenthums which was directed 
against the decision on collective landownership passed by the International's 
Basle Congress (1869), the German armchair-socialist Adolph Wagner used 
several of Chicherin's works to support his case.— 487 
687 The General Council Address to the Spanish workers (see Note 681) was 
published in La Emancipaciân, No. 89, 18 March 1873. In an accompanying 
note,  the editorial board approved of the Address.—488 
688 In a letter of 9 April 1873 Sorge informed Engels that when confirming 
Auguste Serraillier's appointment as representative of the General Council for 

=====第707页=====
Notes 673 
France, Simon Dereure, referring to Benjamin Le Moussu, had levelled a number 
of charges against Serraillier, e.g., that at the time of the Commune he 
had appropriated the money received from priests for the lease of churches. 
Dereure also accused Serraillier of participation in 'the demonstration of the 
22' mentioned by Engels below. 
The demonstration of the 22 probably refers to the protest of the Proudhnonist 
minority in the Paris Commune against the decree on the establishment of the 
Committee of Public Safety which had been passed by a majority vote at the 
Commune's meeting of 1 May 1871.—490 
689 In a letter of 9 April 1873 Sorge asked Engels for detailed information on the 
strife among the Viennese socialists. 
On 15 March 1873 Der Volksstaat, No. 22, printed a letter under the 
heading 'An die sozialdemokratische Partei Oesterreichs' by the socialist Andreas 
Scheu, who accused the editor of the Viennese Volkswille Heinrich Oberwinder of 
opportunism and nationalism. In the reply, carried by the Volkswille, No. 23, 
19 March 1873, Oberwinder reproached Scheu with having links with the 
anarchists.— 491 
690 A reference to the article 'Internationale Arbeiterassoziation' published in the 
Neuer Social-Demokrat, No. 49, 27 April 1873, in which the editors tried to place 
the responsibility for the arrests and trial of the International's members in 
France on Marx and the General Council (see Note 677).— 491 
691 In late 1872 Adolf Hepner was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment for 
'activities in support of the International' and participation in the Hague 
Congress, and expelled from Leipzig in the spring of 1873. He lived in a 
Leipzig suburb for a while, but was forced to move to Breslau (Wroclaw) on 
account of police persecution.—493, 510 
692 Engels probably means the congress of the Jura Federation held on 27-28 April 
1873 in Neuchâtel (a report on the congress appeared in the Bulletin de la 
Federation jurassienne, No. 9, 1 May 1873). The Federation reiterated its refusal 
to recognise the Hague Congress resolutions and proposed sending delegates to 
an international anarchist congress scheduled to open on 1 September 1873 
(see Note 671).—494, 508 
693 The first four points of Engels' recommendations were incorporated by the 
New York General Council into its resolution of 30 May 1873 (see Note 680). 
Engels' proposal on the so-called Italian Federation was also taken into account by 
the Council, which on 30 May drew up a statement complementing the 
above-mentioned resolution.—494 
694 Marx stayed in Manchester from 22 May to about 3 June 1873. The purpose 
of the trip was to consult Doctor Gumpert on a medical question.—495, 516 
695 A reference to Heller's letter to Marx of 14 May 1873.—496 
696 On 24 May 1873 the monarchist majority in the French National Assembly forced 
Thiers to resign, and Marshal MacMahon was elected President of the Third 
Republic. The reactionaries hoped that MacMahon's assumption of power would 
be a step towards the restoration of the monarchy.—499, 504 
697 In this letter, Engels sets forth his ideas for The Dialectics of Nature (see present 
edition, Vol. 25), which he began in 1873. The letter was sent to Manchester, 
where Marx was staying at the time. Engels requested Marx to have Carl 
Schorlemmer and Samuel Moore read it; the manuscript still contains

698 Tne  French medieval logician Jean Buridan (or Buridanus) is said to have 
illustrated the 'unfreedom' of the will by the dilemma of a hungry donkey 
standing exactly in the middle between two bundles of hay and, unable to 
decide which to eat, starving to death. 
Marx refers to the fact that both factions of the monarchist majority in the 
French National Assembly, the Legitimists (supporters of the Bourbon dynasty) 
and the Orleanists (supporters of the Orleans dynasty), failed to agree about a 
pretender to the French throne and nominated the Bonapartist MacMahon to 
the post of President of the Third Republic.—505 
699 French monarchist clerical circles, campaigning for the restoration of the 
monarchy, sought to turn the external political situation to their advantage. 
They demanded that France align herself with the Pope in the struggle against 
the anti-Catholic measures taken by Bismarck's government in Germany (the 
so-called Kulturkampf), and also that France support the Carlist movement in 
Spain (see Note 718).—505 
700 A reference to the General Council's statement on the credentials for France of 
23 May 1873, which countered attempts by the Bakuninists and the Lassalleans 
to place the blame for L. Van Heddeghem's and Emile Dentraygues' betrayal 
on the General Council. The English translation of the statement was the work 
of Engels, who also edited the French translation by Lafargue.—  507,  519 
701 The Second Congress of the International's British Federation was held in 
Manchester on 1-2 June 1873. The congress was attended by 26 delegates from 
23 sections. The congress heard the report of the British Federal Council and 
passed resolutions on the organisation of the British Federation, on propagan­
da, and on the need to set up an international Trades' Union. They voted that 
the Red Flag be declared the banner of the British Federation, and the land 
and all means of production be nationalised. Of particular importance was the 
resolution 'On Political Action, which stressed the need to establish an 
independent proletarian political party in Britain.—508, 519 
702 On 13 April and 8 June 1873 La Liberté carried two letters by Auguste 
Serraillier to the editorial board of 1 April and 27 May, which blamed the 
Blanquists Frederic Cournet and Gabriel Ranvier for the activities of Emile 
Dentraygues, who had betrayed a number of the International's members at 
the Toulouse trial (see Note 677). Serraillier wrote that Cournet and Ranvier 
had granted Dentraygues powers for France without the General Council's 
approval.—509 
703 The first general congress of Swiss trade, cooperative and other organisations 
was convened on the initiative of the International's sections and took place in 
Olten on 1-3 June 1873. It attracted 82 delegates representing about 10,000 
workers. The congress founded the Swiss Workers' Union which existed until 
1880.  The congress paved the way for the establishment, in 1888, of the 
Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland.—509, 526

705 On 11 April 1873 Adolf Hepner sent Engels the above-mentioned letter from 
the Committee of the Social-Democratic Party signed by Theodor Yorck. As is 
clear from Hepner's letter to Engels of 23 April 1873, the latter wrote on the 
subject to Wilhelm Liebknecht before that date. This letter of Engels' has not been 
found.—510 
706 The General Association of German Workers was founded on 23 May 1863 at a 
meeting of workers' societies in Leipzig. The establishment of this political 
organisation promoted the advance of the German workers' movement. 
However, Ferdinand Lassalle and his followers directed the activities of the 
Association along reformist lines. 
With the formation of the International, the sectarian and nationalistic line 
adopted by the Lassallean leadership became an obstacle to the involvement of 
the German workers in the international proletarian movement. Thanks to the 
persistent campaign by Marx, Engels and their followers against Lassalleanism, 
the foremost German workers had parted company with it by the early 1870s. 
At the Gotha Congress held in May 1875 the General Association of German 
Workers merged with the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party 
(Eisenachers).—511,  520 
707 On 7-9 August 1869 a general congress of Social-Democrats from Germany, 
Austria and Switzerland took place in Eisenach. 263 delegates representing over 
150,000 workers attended. The congress founded the German Social-
Democratic Workers' Party, which declared itself a branch of the International 
Working Men's Association. The congress approved a programme incorporat­
ing the main principles of the International's General Rules.—512 
708 In 1872-73 Liebknecht and Hepner repeatedly requested Marx to write a 
pamphlet or a series of articles for Der Volksstaat with a critique of Lassalle's 
ideas.—  514 
709 Engels is replying to Whitter's request of 24 June 1873 for a recommendation 
for John De Morgan, who wanted to reside in Whitter's house.—515 
710 Kugelmann wrote in a letter to Engels of 29 June 1873 that on 28 June 1873 
the Frankfurter Zeitung had carried a notice dated 'London, 26 June' about Karl 
Marx's dangerous illness.—515 
711 On the basis of Engels' letter Kugelmann sent a note to Der Volksstaat which 
appeared in No. 58, 13 July 1873, and read: 'Various newspapers have 
recently reported that Karl Marx was seriously ill. We are pleased to inform 
our readers that this is not the case. Marx has merely been ordered by his 
doctors to work no more than 4-6 hours a day.'—516 
712 The telegram was sent as a reply to Sorge's letter of 11 July 1873 requesting 
more speed in deciding who was to represent the General Council at the 
Geneva Congress, Engels or Serraillier (see Note 672). The General Council 
confirmed Auguste Serraillier as its delegate, and on 8 August sent him 
'Instructions for the delegate of the G.C. to the 6th, General Congress'. 
However, Serraillier did not attend (see Note 724).— 518 
713 Sorge wrote to Engels on 20 June 1873 that three new sections had been set up 
in Buenos Aires, the French, the Italian and the Spanish, numbering 130, 90

and 45 members respectively. He asked Engels to send them the resolutions of 
the Hague Congress. 
The first section of the International in Buenos Aires was set up on 
28 January 1872 and comprised the Paris Commune refugees. The International's 
organisation in Buenos Aires grew with the arrival of delegate to the Hague 
Congress, Raimond Wilmart, who corresponded with Marx and Engels. In 
1873,  a number of new sections were set up in Buenos Aires, consisting mostly of 
emigrants.— 519 
On 11 August 1873, replying to Engels' letter, the General Council instructed 
him to pass on the money collected in the USA for the widows and orphans of 
Communards to Auguste Serraillier. — 520 
Engels is replying to Sorge's questions prompted by the editorial 'Zur Spaltung 
der Arbeiterpartei in Oesterreich' in Der Volksstaat, No. 48, 14 June 1873, 
which sharply criticised Heinrich Oberwinder's opportunistic stand. The 
editorial board termed the actions of Oberwinder's group 'an open betrayal of 
the workers' cause'.— 520 
A reference to a report from Vienna published in Der Volksstaat, No. 59, 
16 July 1873, which quoted in full the resolution proposed by Andreas Scheu 
on 29 June 1873 at a workers' meeting in Wiener-Neustadt where the 
reorganisation of the Austrian Social-Democratic Workers' Party was discussed. 
Alongside consistently democratic demands and calls for the introduction of 
standard working hours and legal restrictions on women's and child labour, the 
resolution contained the statement that 'all other parties constituted a single 
reactionary mass vis-à-vis the proletariat'.— 520 
In Alcoy, a small but industrially important Spanish town, the workers' decision 
to declare a general strike on 7 July 1873 led to the armed uprising of 8 July, 
as a result of which power passed into the hands of the Bakuninists. The Public 
Welfare Committee they had set up (Engels refers to it as the Comité  de salut public 
after the central body of revolutionary government in France during the 
Jacobin dictatorship of 1793-94) displayed total passivity and on 12 July 
surrendered the town to government troops without putting up any resistance. 
These events were thoroughly analysed by Engels in The Bakuninists at Work 
(see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 590-95).—521 
The Carlists, a clerical absolutist group which in the first half of the 19th century 
supported Don Carlos, brother of King Ferdinand VII and pretender to the 
Spanish throne. In 1833-40, the Carlists unleashed a civil war known as the First 
Carlist War. After Don Carlos' death in 1855 they transferred their support to his 
grandson, Don Carlos Jr. In 1872 they stepped up their activities which 
culminated in another civil war in 1873 (the Second Carlist War). The war lasted 
until 1876.—521 
In 1873 Lafargue together with Benjamin Le Moussu and George Moore tried 
to open up in London an association dealing in the production of engravings. 
After Lafargue had resigned from the business in late summer 1873, he was 
replaced by Marx. The association fell apart in the spring of 1874.—  522,  527, 
529, 544, 546

721 Ironically referring to the Bakuninists as teetotallers, Marx was hinting at the 
fact that they preached total abstinence from politics on the part of the 
workers.— 523 
722 A reference to Danielson's letter to Marx of 10 (22) May 1873, which gave a 
detailed exposition of the dispute between Ivan Belyaev and Boris Chicherin 
(see Note 685) and supplied a list of sources on the subject. It also contained a 
review of Russian literature on communal landownership in Russia, a question 
that interested Marx.— 523 
723 In early August 1873 Engels went to Ramsgate to recuperate. He returned to 
London between 12 and 15 September.—  523,  537 
724 A reference to Auguste Serraillier's planned trip to the Geneva Congress of the 
International (see Note 672) as the General Council representative. As a 
member of the British Federal Council, he was also to hold credentials from 
the British sections. However, by the end of August, drawing on the reports 
from the International's local branches, Marx and Engels had already realised 
that under the conditions obtaining at the time the Congress had no chance of 
becoming a truly international forum. They were gravely concerned about the 
conciliatory tendencies being displayed by some of the International's activists 
in Romance Switzerland, and their readiness to go back on a number of the 
Hague Congress resolutions in order to work out a compromise with the 
anarchists. Marx and Engels thus considered it inexpedient to send a 
representative to the Congress and persuaded Serraillier not to go to 
Switzerland.—523, 525, 527, 535, 537 
725 A reference to the General Council documents sent by its Secretary Sorge to 
Engels in connection with the preparations for the International's congress. 
Among them were an Address and the annual official report of the General 
Council of the International Working Men's Association to the Geneva 
Congress, and the 'Annual Confidential Report of the General Council to the 
6th General Congress of the International Working Men's Association in 
Geneva Opening on 8 September  1873'.—  524,  525

Karl Marx. Selected and translated with Explanatory Notes and an Introduction

727 A reference to the letter written in late August 1873 by Henri Perret, Secretary 
of the Romance Federal Council in Switzerland, to Alfred Days, Secretary of 
the British Federal Council. It mirrored the conciliatory attitude taken by some

of the International's Swiss members vis-à-vis the Bakuninist sectarians and 
their willingness to make concessions, notably to revise the resolutions passed 
by the Hague Congress on the powers of the General Council.—  526,  534 
728 Marx alluded to Batrachomyomachia (The Batde of the Frogs and Mice), an 
ancient Greek anonymous mock-heroic poem- parodying Homer's  Iliad.—  527 
729 José Nobre-França, one of the organisers and leaders of the Portuguese 
sections of the International, sent a letter to Marx via Engels thanking him for 
the instalments of the French edition of Volume I of Capital. He noted the 
great importance of Marx's work in popularising the revolutionary theory 
among Portuguese workers and freeing them from the influence of 
Proudhonism.— 527 
730 In a letter which Adolf Hepner received on 4 September 1873, Engels 
described the circumstances in which the Geneva Congress of the International 
was being convened and advised him not to go to Switzerland. The letter has 
not been found, but its contents can be inferred from Hepner's reply of 
5 September 1873 in which he agrees with Engels' reasoning.—  528,  530 
731 A reference to the Address 'Compagnons, notre Association traverse...' signed 
by Henri Perret, C. Bernard, Theodore Duval and others, which was issued in 
August 1873 in Geneva in connection with the forthcoming congress of the 
International (see Note 672). It was directed against some of the Hague 
Congress resolutions on organisational issues.—  530,  535 
732 A reference to John De Morgan's letter to Engels of 15 September 1873 
introducing its bearer, reporter Ellen Carroll. De Morgan requested Engels to 
chair a meeting scheduled for 21 September, at which Miss Carroll was going 
to talk about the Paris Commune.— 531 
733 The Geneva Congress, the first congress of the International Working Men's 
Association, was held on 3-8 September 1866. There were 60 delegates from 
Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland. The Geneva Congress passed a 
number of important resolutions based on Marx's 'Instructions for the 
Delegates of the Provisional General Council. The Different Questions', 
approved the Rules and Regulations, and elected a General Council of the 
Association. The Congress signified the completion of the formative 
period of the International as a mass international proletarian organisation.— 
535 
784 Engels stayed in Germany (Engelskirchen) approximately from 28 October to 
20 November 1873.—536 
755 A reference to the German edition of the pamphlet which appeared in 
Brunswick in the summer of 1874 under the heading Ein Complot gegen die 
Internationale Arbeiter-Association (in Samuel Kokosky's translation). Engels was 
direcdy involved in editing the German translation.—  537,  541 
736 Marx, with his daughter Eleanor, stayed in Harrogate to recuperate from 
24 November to 15 December 1873. On 27 November Marx went to Manches­
ter for the day to consult Doctor Gumpert.—  538,  539, 550 
737 Bakunin announced his decision to withdraw from politics in an open letter 
carried by the Journal de Geneve on 25 September 1873 and in a letter 'Aux 
Compagnons de la Fédération jurassienne' published in the Supplément au 
Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne on 12 October  1873.—  538

738 A reference to the so-called Revolutionary Catechism, a copy of which was found 
in 1869 during the search at the home of Pyotr Uspensky, a member of Sergei 
Nechayev's organisation. The document was reproduced in the official reports on 
the Nechayev trial of 1871 (see K. Marx and F. Engels, The Alliance of Socialist 
Democracy and the International Working Men's Association, present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 527, 544-49).—538 
739 Engels was informed by Enrico Bignami on 22 July 1873 about the 
establishment of a section of the International in Melegnano, which took the 
name of Gustave Flourens. The section voiced its support for the General 
Council.—538 
740 On 10 June 1873 after two abortive attempts Hermann Lopatin managed to 
escape from prison in Irkutsk. That August Lopatin arrived in Paris.— 539,

741 On Lopatin's part in translating Volume I of Capital into Russian see 
Note 146. 
Chapters 2-5 of the first German edition of 1867 correspond to chapters 
IV-XXII of the first English edition, which was published in 1887 and edited 
by Engels (see present edition, Vol. 35).— 540

743 The- Jacobites—supporters of the Stuart King James II of England, who was 
dethroned by the coup d'état of 1688-89, and of his descendants. In 1715 and 
1745,  they made unsuccessful attempts to stage an uprising with a view to 
restoring the Stuart dynasty.— 542 
744 Heinrich Heine's satirical poem 'Disputation' (Romanzero) describes a medieval 
dispute between a Catholic Capuchin and a learned rabbi, who refers to the 
Hebrew scripture Tosafoth Yom Tobh. 'To hell with your book,' 
retorts the friar. Then follows the reply of the enraged rabbi quoted by 
Engels. — 545 
748 Engels is referring to Marx's criticism of John Stuart Mill's vulgar economic 
views on surplus value expounded in Mill's Principles of Political Economy with 
Some of their Applications to Social  Philosophy,  London, 1868. It is to be found in 
the French edition of Volume I of Capital (1875), in the third German edition 
of 1883 and in the English edition of 1887 edited by Engels (see present 
edition, Vol. 35).—545 
746 Wilhelm Busch began observing bullet wounds in late 1870 and published a 
number of works on the subject.— 545 
747 In November and December 1873 L'Internationale printed announcements of 
the publication, scheduled for 1874, of César De Paepe's work Considérations et 
recherches  sur le problème social au XIX siècle,  and gave the table of contents of this 
work. Below Marx quotes the table of contents of Volume 2 featured in 
L'Internationale, Nos. 254, 255 and 257, 23 and 30 November and 14 December 
1873.  De Paepe's work was not published.— 546 
748 In 1868-1878 the Cuban people waged a national liberation war against 
Spanish colonial rule. On 31 October 1873 the Spanish corvette Tornado 
attacked and captured the American steamer Virginius on the open sea. The

steamer was carrying military supplies and reinforcements for the insurgents in 
Cuba. On arrival in Santiago de Cuba, Captain Fry, several of the crew and 
passengers were put to death. The US government demanded that the culprits 
be punished, the vessel returned, and the surviving crew members and 
passengers released. The Spanish head of government Castelar agreed to meet 
some of the demands, but the authorities in Havana refused to act on his orders. 
The conflict was finally settled on 12 December 1873.—547 
749 A reference to the Pope's Encyclical of 21 November 1873 issued in 
connection with the measures introduced by Bismarck's government against the 
Catholic Church in Germany (the so-called Kulturkampf). — 547 
750 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Literature and Art. Selections from Their Writings. International 
Publishers, New York, 1947, and in full in: Marx and Engels, Selected 
Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow,  1955.—  548 
751 The French Marshal François Achille Bazaine, who during the Franco-Prussian 
War surrendered the Metz fortress to the Germans on 27 October 1870, was 
put on trial on the charge of high treason. The trial took place in Versailles 
between 6 October and 10 December 1873. Due d'Aumale chaired the tribunal 
of military officers. Bazaine was given a death sentence, which was commuted 
to one of twenty years' imprisonment. After eight months in prison Bazaine 
fled to Spain in August 1874.— 549 
782 Marx is replying to Allsop's letter of 21 December  1873.—  550 
753 A reference to the participation of Spanish workers in cantonal uprisings in 
Spain launched by the extremist wing of the bourgeois republican federalists 
and their Bakuninist allies in the summer of 1873. These events were the 
climax of the Spanish bourgeois revolution of 1868-74. The defeat of the 
insurgents, whose leaders proved totally incapable of directing popular 
revolutionary action, paved the way for the restoration of the monarchy. For 
details, see Engels' The Bakuninists at Work (present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 581-98).—551 
754 At the elections to the Imperial Diet held on 10 January 1874 the 
Social-Democrats won 9 seats; among those elected were August Bebel and 
Wilhelm Liebknecht.— 551 
755 A reference to the Peasant Reform of 1861 in Russia, which was introduced 
from above by the ruling classes under pressure from the acute crisis of 
serfdom and the growing threat of a popular revolution. The reform was a 
step towards turning Russia from a tsarist empire into a bourgeois monarchy, 
yet it failed to eliminate many of the survivals of the feudal system in the 
country's agriculture. The peasants were set free from personal bondage but 
lost a substantial part of their land. For the plots that were left to them, they 
had to continue doing conscript labour for the landowners until the 
redemption agreement had been concluded. The terms of the redemption 
turned the peasants into debtors of the state, which paid the landowners the 
entire redemption fee, and then collected a far greater redemption sum from 
the peasants over a period of several decades.— 551 
756 A number of European newspapers announced that Marx had been arrested in 
Holland. A statement to this effect appeared in The Pall Mall Gazette, No. 1970, 
7 June 1871, in the article 'The Interregnum'. Marx replied with a letter to the

editor of The Pall Mall Gazette exposing this falsehood (see present edition, 
Vol. 22, p. 360).—561 
757 The information concerning Charles Victor Jaclard and Edme Marie Gustave 
Tridon proved erroneous. Jaclard escaped from prison on 7 October 1871, and 
Tridon emigrated to Brussels, where he died on 31 August  1871.—  561 
758 Marx's portrait, made from a 1867 photograph taken by Fr. Wunder of 
Hanover and engraved on wood by J. Robert, appeared on the front page of 
the Paris L'Illustration, No. 1498, 11 November 1871. The same issue printed 
an anonymous biography of Marx (see Note 684).—  562,  568, 576 
759 The letter gives some idea of Marx's work to organise assistance to the refugee 
Communards.— 565 
760 part 0f  thj s letter was published in English for the first time in Labour Monthly, 
September 1957, and in full in Archiv für Sozialgeschichte, Friedrich-Ebert-
Stiftung Publishers, Vol. II, [Hanover] 1962.—573, 578 
761 Marx reported on the intention of the Gladstone government to subject 
refugee Communards to persecution at the General Council meeting of 
19 December 1871; his speech was published as part of the report on the 
Council meeting in The Eastern Post, No. 169, 23 December 1871.—573 
762 Probably a slip of the pen in Eleanor Marx's letter. The reference is apparently 
to La Philosophie positive, No. 3 for November-December 1868, which featured 
a short review of Volume I of Capital written by Yevgeny De-Roberti. 
Referring to De-Roberti's book, Eleanor Marx probably meant his Politiko-
economicheskiye etyudy (Essays on Politics and Economics), which appeared in 
St Petersburg in 1869.—576 
763 Volume I of Capital first appeared in English under Engels' editorship in 
1887.—576 
764 This letter was written by Liebknecht on 20 February 1872 at Engels' 
suggestion and on the basis of the information supplied by him (see this 
volume, pp. 319-20). Liebknecht sent the text to Engels, who translated it into 
Italian and forwarded it to Carlo Cafiero in Italy to be published in the press 
(a handwritten draft of the translation has survived which is identical to the 
version published in the Gazzettino Rosa). The Gazzettino Rosa dated the letter 
29 February 1872—577 
765 The declaration was written by Marx in connection with the slanderous speech 
made in the House of Commons by Alexander Baillie-Cochrane on 12 April 
1872.  It was published in The Eastern Post, No. 186, 20 April 1872.—578 
766 xhis letter was published in English for the first time in Archiv für 
Sozialgeschichte, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Publishers, Vol. II, [Hanover] 1962.— 
582, 583, 585 
767 A reference to the meetings of the General Council Executive Committee (see 
Note 435). The Committee meetings usually took place at Marx's or Engels' 
homes.— 582
