Preface 
Volume 40 of this edition contains the correspondence of Marx 
and Engels from 1856 to 1859. The latter half of the 1850s 
rounded off the period of political reaction that had set in in Europe 
after the Revolution of 1848-49. The first capitalist world 
economic crisis (1857-58) heralded a new rise of the democratic 
and working-class movements. 
During these years, Marx and Engels continued to develop their 
revolutionary teaching. They set out to arm the proletarian party, 
then in the process of formation, with the theory for the forthcoming 
battles. 'I hope to win a scientific victory for our party,' Marx 
wrote to his friend Joseph Weydemeyer on 1 February 1859 
concerning the main goal he had set himself in his economic 
research (this volume, p. 377). 
The letters in this volume reflect the further development of 
Marxist theory, of its three component parts—political economy, 
philosophy and the theory of the communist transformation of 
society—and the advance of Marxist thought in various other 
fields.  They give an idea of the progress Marx was making in his 
economic studies. In 1857, he began to collate and sum up the 
vast material on political economy he had accumulated over many 
years.  In 1857 and 1858, he wrote a series of economic 
manuscripts which form the first rough draft of Capital. In these 
manuscripts Marx worked out the theory of money in general terms 
and outlined his theory of surplus value, which Engels called Marx's 
second great discovery, the first being the materialist conception of 
history. These two discoveries turned socialism into a science. 
The letters show what titanic labours these manuscripts cost 
him. The economic crisis, and the certainty that it would be

followed by profound revolutionary upheavals, made him hasten 
the work in every way. 'I am working like mad all night and every 
night collating my economic studies so that I at least get the 
outlines clear before the déluge,' he wrote to Engels on 8 December 
1857 (p. 217). The correspondence shows that Marx made very 
great demands on himself as a scholar. Grudging in his judgments of 
his own achievements, he wrote to Engels with satisfaction 
on 16 January 1858: 'I had been overdoing very much my noctur­
nal labours.... I am, by the way, discovering some nice arguments. 
E.g. I have completely demolished the theory of profit' 
(p. 249). 
The Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58, also known as the 
Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie (they will be found, 
together with A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part 
One, 1859, in Vols. 29 and 30), testify that in his economic 
works too Marx was enriching other areas of social science, 
especially philosophy, and was also perfecting his method of 
research into social phenomena. Marx attached great importance 
to dialectics, reinterpreted in the materialist spirit on the basis 
of a critical understanding of Hegel's philosophy. Marx even 
had the intention, which he unfortunately never carried out, of 
writing a book on this subject. 'If ever the time comes when such 
work is again possible, I should very much like to write 2 or 
3 sheets making accessible to the common reader the rational 
aspect of the method which Hegel not only discovered but also 
mystified' (p. 249). 
As Marx built up his new economic theory, he was also 
developing the structure of his future economic work. The letters 
give us an idea of the scope and comprehensive nature of the 
work he planned, which was to cover the economic foundations 
and political superstructure of the capitalist system. His letters to 
Ferdinand Lassalle of 22 February and to Engels of 2 April 1858, 
and also the letter to Joseph Weydemeyer of 1 February 1859, 
show that Marx intended to publish the work in six books: 
1) On Capital, 2) On Landed Property, 3) On Wage Labour, 4) On 
the State, 5) International Trade, 6) World Market (p. 270). Even 
while the first book was being written, some changes had to be made 
in this plan. Marx was unable to fit in all the material, so he decided 
to divide it into two parts, the first on the commodity and money, 
the second specifically on capital (the production of surplus value, 
etc.). 
A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One, which 
came off the press on 11 June 1859, was a major event in the

history of economic thought. Although, because of its limited 
range, the book could not include Marx's fundamental work on 
the theory of surplus value, it did contain the scientific prerequis­
ites for it in the shape of a new theory of money and value. 
As can be seen from the letters, Marx considered it extremely 
important to popularise this work. The first successful attempt in 
this direction was undertaken by Engels, whose review is 
mentioned in the correspondence. 
Marx began work on the second part shortly after sending the 
manuscript of the first to the publishers (Marx to Engels, 21 
February 1859). However, he soon realised that he would need to 
do more research on a number of important aspects of surplus 
value and its transmuted forms (profit, interest and rent). The 
work dragged on and grew beyond the limits initially marked out 
for it. Furthermore, as the letters of 1859 show, Marx repeatedly 
had to break off in order to attend to urgent practical matters (the 
publication of the newspaper Das Volk, etc.). Subsequent letters 
give an idea of the further stages in his work. 
Marx kept Engels constantly informed of the progress and 
results of his economic research. Engels readily helped him with 
advice, gave freely of the knowledge and experience he had 
acquired in long commercial practice, and supplied Marx with 
valuable material. 
The correspondence published in this volume also gives some 
idea of Marx's and Engels' work in other fields of knowledge 
during this period, and of the variety and scope of their interests. 
They exchanged opinions on world history, the history of 
diplomacy, the history of various countries and peoples (among 
them Russia, Prussia and Poland), philology (especially in connec­
tion with Engels' study of the Slavonic languages), world literature, 
the natural sciences, and so on. 
Prominent in Engels' work of the 1850s and early 1860s were 
studies in military history and the theory of warfare, for he was 
aware of the importance to proletarian revolutionaries of master­
ing military knowledge for the expected new outburst of 
revolutionary struggle. On 15 November 1857, Engels wrote to 
Marx that, should another revolution break out in Europe 
following the economic crisis, this would at once give 'a more 
practical slant' to his military studies (pp. 203-04). 
Engels continued to publish reviews of current military events in 
periodicals, and also wrote a series of articles on the art of war 
and military history for The New American Cyclopaedia (see present 
edition, Vol. 18). The letters in this volume show that he did this

XX Preface 
in close cooperation with Marx. The two friends helped one 
another in finding sources and selecting material, and some of the 
articles for the Cyclopaedia were, in effect, written by them jointly. 
Besides doing all the articles on specifically military problems, 
Engels constantly helped Marx by handling the military questions 
in the articles that Marx wrote for the Cyclopaedia, especially in the 
biographical essays on military and political leaders (Barclay de 
Tolly, Bern, Blücher and others). Marx used some of Engels' 
letters (pp. 163-64, 166-68, 178-80) as preliminary drafts of 
articles. For his part, Marx looked up references for Engels in the 
British Museum Library and copied out extracts from various 
sources. 
Engels' articles for The New American Cyclopaedia, especially on 
general subjects, such as 'Army', 'Artillery', 'Cavalry', 'Fortification' 
and 'Infantry', were an important contribution to Marxist military 
science. Marx believed that in them Engels had given further 
proof of the universal relevance of the materialist conception of 
history. 'Your "Army" is capital,' he wrote to Engels on 25 
September 1857. 'More graphically than anything else the history 
of the army demonstrates the Tightness of our views as to the 
connection between the productive forces and social relations' 
(p. 186). He also praised Engels' other articles (see, for example, his 
letters to Engels of 10 June and 10 October 1859). 
Marx valued his friend's ability to discuss questions of military 
history in the context of the political tasks that faced the 
proletarian revolutionaries, and to substantiate revolutionary 
tactics militarily. A case in point is Engels' pamphlet Po and Rhine 
(1859),  in which military analysis serves to prove the need for a 
proletarian approach to the problem of Italy's unification, as well 
as to denounce the policies of the French Bonapartists and the 
Prussian and Austrian ruling circles. 'Have read it all; exceedingly 
clever; the political side is also splendidly done and that was 
damned difficult,' Marx wrote to Engels after he had gone over 
the pamphlet (p. 400). 
Observing the spectacular development of the natural sciences 
in the mid-19th century, Marx and Engels considered it essential 
to interpret the latest scientific achievements in the light of their 
revolutionary world outlook. They regarded progress in these 
fields as expanding the scientific basis of their theories. 
Engels' letter to Marx of 14 July 1858, containing an extensive 
programme for the study of the latest findings of science, shows 
that Engels had already conceived the idea of giving a philosophi­
cal generalisation, from a dialectical materialist position, of the 

=====第19页=====
Preface XXI 
development of physics, chemistry, biology and the other sciences, 
which he eventually realised in his Dialectics of Nature. 
Engels was one of the first to grasp the enormous significance of 
Darwin's theory of evolution. He read On the Origin of Species by 
Means of Natural Selection in 1859, when the book was published, 
and wrote to Marx as follows: 'Darwin ... whom I'm reading just 
now, is absolutely splendid. There was one aspect of teleology that 
had yet to be demolished, and that has now been done. Never 
before has so grandiose an attempt been made to demonstrate 
historical evolution in Nature, and certainly never to such good 
effect' (p. 551). 
In the years covered by this volume, political journalism 
remained for Marx and Engels their most important means of 
disseminating revolutionary ideas, and substantiating proletarian 
revolutionary tactics on crucial social and political problems. The 
correspondence reflects their intensive journalistic activities during 
this period. In many letters they discuss the contents of articles 
for the New-York Daily Tribune and other periodicals. Economic 
processes in the capitalist world were increasingly attracting their 
attention. Observing the rapid growth of capitalist production, 
Marx compared the 1850s with the dawn of the capitalist era, 
which was marked by abrupt changes in economic and social 
relations. 'There is no denying that bourgeois society has for the 
second time experienced its 16th century,' he wrote to Engels on 8 
October 1858 (p. 346). Marx and Engels also saw the reverse side 
of the rise of the capitalist economy: the deepening of its inherent 
contradictions and the inevitability of periodic economic crises. In 
many letters they pointed to the world-wide scale of the 1857 crisis 
and noted the gradual involvement of different countries in it, its 
spread to various spheres of the economy, and the grave effect it 
had on the position of the masses. Apart from the series of articles 
on the crisis published in the New-York Daily Tribune, Marx 
intended to write, jointly with Engels, a pamphlet on the subject 
(Marx to Engels, 18 December 1857). However, the plan did not 
materialise. 
Marx and Engels followed current events very closely, especially 
the social and political shifts caused by the 1857 crisis. Although it 
did not lead directly to revolutionary upheavals, its revolutionising 
effect on society was very considerable. 'Taken all in all, the crisis 
has been burrowing away like the good old mole it is,' Marx wrote to 
Engels on 22 February 1858 (p. 274).

XXII Preface 
Marx and Engels considered it highly important that the 1857 
crisis should have hit industry and finance in England, the most 
economically developed country in the capitalist world of that 
time.  In a letter to Engels dated 8 December 1857 Marx pointed 
out that despite all the attempts by bourgeois economists and 
political writers to represent England's economy as stable and 
invulnerable, catastrophe had descended on this citadel of 
capitalism (p. 215). The economic upheaval in England was 
aggravating its internal situation and intensifying the dissatisfac­
tion of the masses with the obsolete oligarchic system. As can be 
seen from the letters, Marx and Engels did not rule out the 
possibility that the economic crisis might give rise to violent 
political conflicts and demonstrations against the ruling class by 
broad social sections, especially the proletariat. As a result, 
England might be drawn into revolutionary events should they 
occur again in Continental Europe. As early as 31 March 1857, 
when the first symptoms of the economic difficulties appeared, 
Marx wrote to Engels: 'England is entering upon a sérieuse crisis ... 
and if the move is resumed on the Continent, John Bull will not 
maintain the stance of supercilious detachment he adopted in 
1848'  (p. 113). 
The economic crisis had an even greater effect on France. The 
entrepreneurial fever prevalent in the Second Empire, the 
unbridled Stock Exchange speculation, the corruption at all levels 
of the state machinery, and the predatory policy of the banks, 
such as the Crédit mobilier, resulted in the economic crisis being 
particularly destructive. Marx wrote to Engels on 18 December 
1857 about 'the general rottenness of the bankrupt State' (p. 225). 
Marx and Engels held that during the economic crisis Napoleon 
Ill's empire had taken yet another step towards its inevitable 
collapse, as was manifest, particularly, in the growing anti-
Bonapartist mood everywhere. In a letter to Marx on 17 March 
1858,  Engels pointed to the ferment among the Paris workers, 
who openly displayed their republican convictions and their 
sympathies for Orsini, the Italian patriot executed for an attempt 
to assassinate Louis Napoleon. Deportations and arrests, he wrote, 
had borne as little fruit as the workers' settlements and the 
national workshops. The government's police measures and 
attempts to pose as a patron of the working class were unable to 
arrest the growing movement against the Bonapartist dictatorship 
(p. 289). 
Developments in Germany, which were also considerably influ­
enced by the crisis, seemed to give an indication of the changes that 

=====第21页=====
Preface XXIII 
were in the offing. Marx and Engels were particularly interested in 
the position of Prussia. In their opinion, the virtual restoration of 
absolutism there after the Revolution of 1848-49, an absolutism only 
scantily veiled by pseudo-constitutional institutions, had been a 
consequence of the German bourgeoisie's cowardly half-measures. 
In the 1850s, too, the bourgeoisie, with its constitutional-monarchy 
illusions and its fear of the masses, continued to display a timid 
circumspection. 'The bourgeois and philistines have, at any rate, got 
even worse since 1848,' Engels wrote to Marx on 17 March 1858. 
'...Plainly your good, honest German has not yet emerged from the 
hibernation that followed the strenuous exertions of 1848' (p. 292). 
However, the rapid growth of industry and trade, which Marx and 
Engels noted in their letters more than once, was deepening the 
conflict between the demands of economic and social development 
and the semi-feudal political system and making the fragmentation 
of the country more and more intolerable. In Prussia and the other 
German states all this was sowing the seeds of further conflict 
between the forces of progress and reaction. 
In their letters of 1858 and subsequent years, Marx and Engels 
noted that Russia was becoming one of the hotbeds of revolutionary 
ferment in Europe. The crisis of the feudal serf system, aggravated 
by defeat in the 1853-56 Crimean War, and growing peasant unrest 
which drove the ruling circles to look for a solution in peasant 
reform, were seen by Marx and Engels as evidence that major 
revolutionary events were imminent in Russia. In a letter to Engels 
on 29 April 1858, Marx expressed the hope that should such events 
take place, the Tsarist autocracy's position would be undermined 
both within the country and internationally. 'The movement for the 
emancipation of the serfs in Russia strikes me as important in so far 
as it indicates the beginning of an internal development that might 
run counter to the country's traditional foreign policy' (p. 310). 
The ideologists of the working class were coming round to the idea 
that a revolutionary Russia was arising in opposition to the Tsarist 
autocracy—the revolutionary movement's worst enemy—and they 
welcomed it as a powerful force for social progress and as a major 
factor in the struggle for the revolutionary renewal of the whole of 
Europe. 
Events in the colonies were a further important topic of the 
correspondence. In the 1850s, Marx and Engels repeatedly 
denounced the capitalist colonial system in the press. Aware of the 
importance of working out a programme on the national and 
colonial question, and of the need to define the attitude of the 
working class to the national liberation movement of the oppressed

XXIV Preface 
peoples, Marx and Engels unmasked the policy of colonial 
expansion, to which more and more Asian and African countries 
were falling victim, and the savage rule of the capitalist 'mother 
countries' in the colonies. 
Engels' letter to Marx of 23 May 1856 in which, from personal 
knowledge, he describes the consequences of the English land­
lords'  and bourgeoisie's domination in Ireland is a powerful 
expression of his views. He wrote that the country had been 
utterly ruined by wars of conquest, by punitive police measures 
and by the ruthless exploitation of the working people. 
'...Through systematic oppression,' Engels wrote, the Irish 'have 
come to be a completely wretched nation...' (p. 50). The famine 
of 1845-47, the mass emigration which completely depopulated 
the country, and the landowners' transition to large-scale sheep-
breeding, accompanied by the expulsion of small tenant farmers 
(the 'clearances'), were an appalling tragedy for the Irish masses. 
Ireland had been reduced to an agrarian adjunct of capitalist 
England. Engels wrote that 'Ireland may be regarded as the 
earliest English colony and one which, by reason of her proximity, 
is still governed in exactly the same old way; here one cannot fail 
to notice that the English citizen's so-called freedom is based on 
the oppression of the colonies' (p. 49). 
Marx and Engels witnessed a series of new colonial wars 
unleashed by the ruling classes of West European countries: the 
Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57, the Anglo-Franco-Chinese war of 
1856-60, the Spanish-Moroccan war of 1859-60. In their letters 
they characterised these as wars of annexation and plunder. 
Engels called the British government's colonial actions 'military 
ventures' (p. 115). Marx gives similar descriptions (see his letters to 
Engels of 24 March and 22 May 1857). 
The correspondence gives an idea of the sympathy with which 
Marx and Engels followed the development of the mass struggle 
against foreign oppression in the colonies and dependent coun­
tries.  They showed particular interest in the great popular uprising 
of 1857-59 in India, which shook English rule there, and made 
references to it in many of their letters (Marx to Engels, 
6 and 14 July, 23 September, 20 October 1857 and 14 January 
1858;  Engels to Marx, 24 September and 29 October 1857). In the 
uprising, started by the sepoys in the Bengal army, Marx and 
Engels saw indications of a true national liberation struggle, 
a sign of mounting resistance to the colonialists by the oppressed 
peoples. Although the insurgents were defeated, Marx and 
Engels regarded their action as a portent of the future collapse

Preface XXV 
of colonialism under the blows of the anti-colonial move­
ment. 
The Indian uprising convinced Marx of the correctness of his 
earlier conclusion that the national liberation movement and the 
proletariat's struggle against the capitalist system were closely 
interlinked. The blows dealt to capitalism in the colonies were 
shaking its position at home and making it more difficult for 
capitalism to use colonial resources for strengthening its domina­
tion, and facilitating the triumph of the proletarian revolution. 'In 
view of the drain of men and bullion which she will cost the 
English, India is now our best ally,' Marx wrote to Engels on 16 
January 1858 (p. 249). 
As in the preceding years, Marx and Engels devoted much 
attention in their letters to a wide range of problems concerning 
the foreign policies pursued by the ruling classes of the European 
powers and the history of diplomacy. In assessing the international 
situation after the Crimean War of 1853-56, Marx and Engels 
found it fraught with new complications and wars. They saw the 
Bonapartist Second Empire as the main source of military danger. 
Its rulers combined adventurism and ambitions for conquest with 
blatant demagogy in the national question, their purpose being to 
exploit the national movements in the interests of Bonapartist 
France. The proletarian revolutionaries regarded the denunciation 
of this 'most repulsive combination of Bonapartism and drivel 
about nationalities' (Marx to Lassalle, 22 November 1859) as one 
of their main tasks (p. 537). 
This became particularly urgent in view of the war of France 
and Piedmont against Austria, which broke out in April 1859. The 
interference of Napoleon III in Italian affairs was motivated by 
the desire to avert a revolutionary explosion on the Apennine 
Peninsula, to strengthen the Second Empire's hegemony in 
Europe and, by external successes, to consolidate the shaky 
Bonapartist regime in France  itself.  The Piedmontese liberal-
monarchist circles were acting in alliance with the Bonapartists, 
with whose aid they were trying to unify Italy under the House of 
Savoy, which ruled Piedmont (see Marx's letter to Lassalle of 4 
February 1859). At the same time, the war against the Austrian 
monarchy, Italy's age-old oppressor, was welcomed by patriotic 
forces as a signal for the liberation struggle. Popular uprisings 
occurred in a number of Italian states. This drove Napoleon III to 
conclude a hasty peace with the Austrians, which Marx and Engels 
described as discreditable (see Engels' letter to Marx of 15 July 
1859).  As a result, Italy remained fragmented. 

=====第24页=====
XXVI Preface 
As can be seen from their letters, Marx and Engels considered it 
essential to show that French Bonapartism was as big a barrier to 
the national liberation and unification of Italy as the Austrian 
Empire, that the Bonapartist regime was a threat to all progressive 
forces in Europe, and that it was, in particular, an obstacle to a 
united Germany. 
During the Italian crisis, when even democrats in Europe had 
fallen for Bonapartist propaganda and 'the confusion presently 
reigning in men's minds has reached a curious peak' (p. 436), 
Marx and Engels worked out clear-cut tactics to turn what was on 
both sides a dynastic war of annexation into a revolutionary war of 
liberation by the Italian and German peoples. They elaborated 
their views on the war in a number of writings published at the 
time (see, for example, Engels' Po and Rhine and Marx's 'On 
Italian Unity' in Vol. 16 of the present edition). The main points 
were also elucidated in the letters included in this volume. 
Marx and Engels held that both Italy and Germany should be 
united 'from below', by revolutionary action on the part of the 
masses, and regarded the defeat of Bonapartism — the main 
opponent of a democratic solution to the Italian and German 
national problems—as the most urgent task. Hence the states in 
the German Confederation should not remain neutral; they 
should come out against Bonapartist France. According to Marx 
and Engels, this was in no way tantamount to supporting Austria. 
In their opinion, a war for the German people's national interests 
was bound to assume a revolutionary character and therefore 
contribute to the liberation of Italy, and rouse the revolutionary 
forces in other European countries, including France. Disclosing 
the essence of this tactic, Marx wrote to Engels on 6 May 1859 
that it was absolutely essential that the proletarian revolutionaries 
'do not identify' their cause 'with that of the present German 
governments' (p. 431). They should strive for a development of 
events that would lead to an all-European revolution, and it was 
particularly important that things should 'come to a head in Paris' 
(p. 430). The ideas on the 1859 Italian crisis contained in the 
letters of Marx and Engels hold an important place in the tactical 
arsenal of proletarian parties. 
This volume also throws light on the efforts of Marx and Engels 
to create a proletarian party. They were above all concerned with 
the ideological education of their followers and comrades-in-arms, 
the proletarian revolutionaries who had been members of the 

=====第25页=====
Preface XXVII 
Communist League and who were to form the nucleus of the 
future party. Without predetermining its organisational structure, 
for they believed that this must depend on the actual conditions in 
which the working-class movement developed, Marx and Engels 
were working both to rally the proletarian forces internationally 
and, wherever possible, to unite the working class on a national 
scale. They thought it vital to strengthen the ties among the 
working-class leaders of various countries and, as can be seen from 
their correspondence, did everything to this end. 
German workers and intellectuals wrote to Marx, seeking his 
advice on tactical matters. Thus, in the spring of 1856, he was 
approached from Germany by Johannes Miquel, a former member 
of the Communist League (Marx to Engels, 26 April and 7 May 
1856).  At the end of February that year, Gustav Levy visited Marx 
with a message from the workers of Düsseldorf, and Marx 
explained the need for meticulous organisation and propaganda, 
warning him of the danger of premature local uprisings in the 
midst of a general lull in the revolutionary movement (Marx to 
Engels, 5 March 1856). 
Information on the state of the working-class movement in the 
USA was supplied to Marx and Engels by Joseph Weydemeyer. 
The organisers of the Communist Club in New York also kept in 
touch with Marx (Marx to Engels, 13 August 1858 and 9 February 
1859,  and Engels to Marx, 18 July 1859). 
Marx and Engels pinned great hopes on the revolutionary wing 
of the English working-class movement, as represented by the Left 
Chartists led by Ernest Jones. Their activities opened up prospects 
for establishing a mass working-class party in England. It was with 
this in mind that Marx advised Jones to transfer the centre of 
agitation directly into the midst of the industrial proletariat. Jones 
'should begin by forming a party, for which purpose he must go to 
the manufacturing districts,' Marx wrote to Engels on 24 
November 1857 (p. 210). 
However, these hopes were not justified. By then, the Chartist 
movement was steadily losing support among the masses. Jones' 
ideological vacillations, especially his tendency to follow the lead of 
the radical bourgeoisie, were a disturbing symptom. Marx 
repeatedly warned the Chartist leader about his mistakes (Marx to 
Engels, 24 November and 22 December 1857 and 14 January 
1858).  At one point, Marx and Engels even temporarily broke with 
Jones. 
Jones'  political vacillations reflected the rise of a reformist trend 
within the English working-class movement. Marx and Engels saw 

=====第26页=====
XXVIII Preface 
it as the result of a privileged section forming in the English 
working class. On 7 October 1858, Engels wrote to Marx: '...The 
English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, 
so that the ultimate aim of this most bourgeois of all nations would 
appear to be the possession, alongside the bourgeoisie, of a 
bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat. In the case of a 
nation which exploits the entire world this is, of course, justified to 
some extent' (p. 344). This development of a labour aristocracy, a 
new phenomenon detected by Engels and, at the time, characteris­
tic only of England, was made possible by England's industrial and 
colonial monopoly, which enabled the English bourgeoisie to use 
part of its super-profits to buy off a section of the working class. 'In 
both respects,' Lenin wrote, referring to England's vast colonies and 
monopoly profit in the context of this passage in Engels' letter, 
'England at that time was an exception among capitalist countries, 
and Engels and Marx, analysing this exception, quite clearly and 
definitely indicated its connection with the (temporary) victory of 
opportunism in the English labour movement' (Collected Works, 
Vol. 23, p. 112). 
However, despite the decline of Chartism, Marx and Engels 
were convinced that the revolutionary trend in the English 
working-class movement would in some form be reborn and carry 
on Chartism's finest traditions. They therefore considered it 
essential to help to awaken the revolutionary energy of the British 
working class in every possible way. 
The new development in the working-class movement in the late 
1850s—the spread of strikes, the emergence of new professional 
and other organisations, and the workers' participation in political 
campaigns—stimulated Marx and Engels to step up their efforts 
to strengthen the nucleus of the future proletarian party. The 
situation demanded vigorous action, the intensified propagation of 
revolutionary theory and closer contact with the masses. Marx in 
particular resumed his participation in the London German 
Workers' Educational Society, in which sectarian and adventurist 
elements had prevailed for a period. By this time, however, Marx's 
comrades had regained their influence in the society. 
Marx was seeking new ways of popularising the principles of the 
proletarian party then being formed. He thought it possible also to 
use Europe's progressive bourgeois press to this end. 'Times have 
changed,' he wrote to Lassalle on 28 March 1859, 'and I now 
consider it essential that our party should secure positions 
wherever possible, even if only for a time, so that others should 
not gain possession of the terrain' (p. 409). The long negotiations

Preface XXIX 
Marx held with the editors of the Viennese liberal newspaper Die 
Presse on work as a correspondent reflect this attitude, as do the 
ideas he expressed on the terms under which a journalist 
committed to the cause of the proletariat could contribute to a 
bourgeois press organ (Marx to Engels, 16 April and 16 and 18 
May" 1859; to Lassalle, 22 February 1858, 28 March and 5 May 
1859,  and to Friedländer, 16 May 1859). Marx's main stipulation 
was the right to express his own views on political issues, without 
adapting to editorial policies. 
It was at this time that Marx endeavoured to start a proletarian 
paper. From the letters published in this volume it can be seen 
how much energy he spent on converting the newspaper Das Volk, 
which had been published by the German Workers' Educational 
Society and other German workers' organisations in London from 
May 1859, into a mouthpiece of the proletarian party (see, 
in particular, his letters to Engels of 18 May and 10 June 
1859). 
From the beginning of July, Marx was its de facto editor, 
handling all administrative and business matters, whose manage­
ment until then had left 'a great deal to be desired', as he had 
earlier written to Engels (p. 457). Under Marx's management, and 
thanks also to Engels' cooperation, the paper became a real 
communist propaganda organ, a medium for explaining the 
principles of the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution­
aries.  However, it proved impossible to regularise its finances, and, 
after the sixteenth issue on 10 August 1859, the paper ceased 
publication. 
The process of forming a working-class party inevitably involved 
the dissociation of the proletarian revolutionaries from the 
proponents of sectarian and reformist ideologies alien to them. 
Marx's and Engels' relationship with Ferdinand Lassalle, the father 
of a special brand of petty-bourgeois socialism and of an 
opportunist trend in the German working-class movement, pro­
vides a good illustration of this, and their correspondence with 
him is most revealing in this respect. 
Lassalle first met Marx and Engels in Germany during the 
Revolution of 1848-49 and kept in touch with them in the years 
that followed. In his letters to Marx he called himself the latter's 
pupil. For some time, Marx and Engels considered him a man 
close to their own circle, though they had been hearing about the 
dissatisfaction of workers in the Rhine Province with Lassalle's 
arrogance and overweening behaviour (Marx to Engels, 5 March 
and 10 April 1856). However, they valued his energy and his

XXX Preface 
talent as a propagandist and orator, and hoped that he would 
overcome these failings. 
Early in 1858, after reading Lassalle's two-volume work, Die 
Philosophie Herakleitos des Dunklen von Ephesos, Marx came to the 
conclusion that Lassalle's views were far removed from the 
revolutionary materialist world outlook. 'Heraclitus, the Dark 
Philosopher by Lassalle the Luminous One is, au fond,  a very silly 
concoction,' he wrote to Engels on 1 February, stressing that 
essentially Lassalle confined himself to restating some of the 
propositions of Hegel's idealistic philosophy, of which, moreover, 
he only had a superficial understanding (p. 259). In a letter to 
Lassalle, on 31 May 1858, Marx tried to explain the need for a 
critical mastery of Hegel's dialectics, for a review of its idealistic 
basis,  for divesting it of the 'mystical aura' given it by Hegel 
(p. 316). 
It soon turned out that Lassalle also had differences with Marx 
and Engels on politics and tactics. In March 1859, he sent them 
his historical drama, Franz von Sickingen, which dealt with the 
uprising of the Swabian and Rhenish knights against their feudal 
lords in 1522-23, on the eve of the great Peasant War (1525). In 
analysing the drama Marx and Engels formulated some cardinal 
propositions of Marxist aesthetics. The letters to Lassalle from 
Marx on 19 April and from Engels on 18 May 1859 disclosed the 
essence of realism as the most progressive method of portraying 
life in art. Discussing the faults and merits of Lassalle's work, 
Marx and Engels reproached him above all for his departure from 
realism, for using abstract rhetoric in place of a truthful and visual 
portrayal of the characters, thus turning them into 'mere 
mouthpieces for the spirit of the times' (p. 420). The main 
character, Sickingen, has none of the traits of a rebellious knight. 
He epitomises the insoluble and therefore tragic contradiction 
between the leaders and the masses, a contradiction which Lassalle 
held to be a feature of any revolution. Lassalle's drama, in Engels' 
words, was 'too abstract, not realistic enough' (p. 444). Marx and 
Engels also held that Lassalle's inability to give a true picture of 
the historical situation betrayed itself in the way he virtually 
ignored the social background of the events he depicted—the 
peasants and the plebs in the grip of revolutionary ferment. 
According to Marx and Engels, the characters in realistic works 
should be both individual and typical, and should reflect the 
nature of the class to which they belong. Moreover, realist authors 
should not express their ideas as reasoned arguments, but through 
full-blooded characters and lively action. In Marx's and Engels'

Preface XXXI 
view, Lassalle shared, in an exaggerated form, a weakness of the 
great poet and dramatist Schiller—his inclination to abstract 
didacticism. A realist writer, however, should, as Engels pointed 
out, try for 'the complete fusion of greater intellectual profundity, 
of a consciously historical content', typical of Schiller's dramas, 
'with Shakespearean vivacity and wealth of action', with Shakes­
peare's ability to portray true human passion and suffering, the 
complexity and contradictory aspects of human nature (p. 442). 
In their letters, Marx and Engels touch on the problem of the 
writer's political position, and on the connection of literature and 
art with life. Believing that a definite ideological and political 
orientation is inherent in any work of art, the founders of 
Marxism always deplored attempts to separate art and politics— 
the theory of 'art for art's sake'. It was at that time that they 
condemned the tendency of the poet Ferdinand Freiligrath to 
oppose literary interests to party obligations (Engels to Marx, 28 
November 1859, Marx to Engels, 10 December 1859). In the 
opinion of Marx and Engels, it was the organic combination of 
ideology and artistic mastery which made art and literature such a 
powerful lever of social progress. 
Marx and Engels regarded as quite legitimate Lassalle's en­
deavour to make his drama topical, to link it with the vital task of 
uniting Germany, but they held that its political tendency was 
profoundly wrong. It was obvious to them that Sickingen, the 
knight, was in effect a reactionary whose movement aimed at a 
return to the era of feudal injustice and club-law, and that Lassalle 
was aggrandising the historical predecessor of the German 
Junkers, representing him as the true champion of national 
unification. Marx pointed this out to Lassalle: 'Have not you 
yourself—like your Franz von Sickingen — succumbed, to some 
extent, to the diplomatic error of regarding the Lutheran-knightly 
opposition as superior to the plebeian-Münzerian?' (p. 420). 
The preference for chivalry and the burgher opposition Lassalle 
showed in his drama reflected his view of the part played by their 
historical successors—the Junkers and the bourgeoisie—in the 
cause of German unity. He underestimated the role of the masses 
in this process and had a nihilistic attitude to the peasants, whom 
he attributed to the reactionary mass. In contrast, Marx and 
Engels considered that only vigorous action by the working class 
and its ally, the peasantry, could give the struggle for national 
unity a truly democratic revolutionary character, and that the 
consolidation of this alliance would open up prospects for a 
transition to the socialist stage of revolution. 'The whole thing in

XXXII Preface 
Germany will depend on whether it is possible to back the 
Proletarian revolution by some second edition of the Peasants' 
War' (p. 41). 
Lassalle's position on the unification of Germany was laid wide 
open when in May 1859 he published the pamphlet Der italienische 
Krieg und die Aufgabe Preußens. By aligning himself with the 
Prussophile bourgeoisie and the Junkers, Lassalle was virtually 
urging Prussia to avail itself of Austria's defeat to carry out its 
plans for unification, plans which envisaged no changes in the 
political or social system. Meanwhile, Lassalle depicted Napoleon 
Ill's Italian policy as objectively progressive. 
These views were completely at odds with those of Marx and 
Engels. Characterising the essence of their political differences, 
Lenin wrote: 'Lassalle was adapting himself to the victory of 
Prussia and Bismarck, to the lack of sufficient strength in the 
democratic national movements of Italy and Germany. Thus 
Lassalle deviated towards a national-liberal labour policy, whereas 
Marx encouraged and developed an independent, consistently 
democratic policy hostile to national-liberal cowardice' (Collected 
Works, Vol. 21, p. 141). 
'Lassalle's pamphlet is an enormous blunder,' Marx wrote to 
Engels on 18 May 1859 (p. 435). In a letter of 10 June that year, 
he told Lassalle that the pamphlet 'in no way corresponds with my 
own view or that of my party friends in England' (p. 460). Marx 
was particularly angered by Lassalle's posing as the spokesman of 
the party. He regarded it as a breach of party discipline to make 
statements in the press on behalf of the party without ascertaining 
the views of other members (p. 435). 
Marx saw that Lassalle's position was very close to that of the 
liberal bourgeoisie, and also of pro-Bonaparte and Prussophile 
vulgar democrats such as Karl Vogt. Lassalle 'in point of fact was 
piping the same tune as Vogt', he wrote to Engels on 26 
November 1859 (p. 542). Marx considered that Lassalle attempted 
to obstruct the public denunciation of Vogt as a Bonapartist agent 
and a slanderer of the proletarian revolutionaries because Vogt 
and Lassalle held identical views. In his work Herr Vogt, published 
in 1860 (this edition, Vol. 17), he therefore not only dealt a 
crushing blow at the political concepts of Vogt but, without 
mentioning Lassalle by name, attacked his views too. 
Lassalle's literary and political activities were making his 
unreliability as a comrade-in-arms increasingly clear to Marx and 
Engels. Nevertheless, they had not yet finally lost hope of setting 
him on the right road, of stimulating him to act at least as a

fellow-traveller of the proletarian revolutionaries. Subsequent 
events, however, widened the rift and led to a final rupture. 
The letters in this volume contain valuable biographical material 
on the life of Marx and his family and of Engels in these years. 
The second half of the 1850s were hard years for Marx. As 
before, he was in serious financial difficulties and fighting for his 
very existence. 'I would not wish my worst enemy to have to wade 
through the quagmire in which I've been trapped for the past two 
months, fuming the while over the innumerable vexations that are 
ruining my intellect and destroying my capacity for work,' he 
wrote to Engels at a moment of extreme distress (p. 331). The 
moral and political atmosphere that surrounded the revolutionary 
refugees was also oppressive. After Orsini's assassination attempt, 
refugees in England were put under political surveillance and 
their letters were opened (see the letters of Marx to Engels of 2 
and 5 March and Engels' letter to Marx of 4 March 1858). They 
had to face repeated insinuations in the bourgeois press, 
slanderous allegations by their enemies among the vulgar demo­
crats (Kinkel, Heinzen, Vogt), the cowardly apostasy of their allies 
(Blind) and the withdrawal from politics of former friends 
(Dronke, Cluss and Freiligrath). 
Marx, however, bore all his trials with courage and remarkable 
fortitude. The letters in this volume are permeated with optimism 
and the expectation of new revolutionary events. 
The letters show vividly how the unique friendship between 
Marx and Engels strengthened with the years and how great was 
their mutual attachment. In Engels this manifested itself in his 
selfless willingness time and again to come to the aid of Marx and 
his family, to spend his energies on 'accursed commerce' (Engels 
to Marx, 17 November 1856) in order to be able to give Marx 
material support, and to take upon himself a considerable part of 
Marx's journalistic work so as to free him for economic research; 
while on Marx's part, it expressed itself in infinite gratitude, 
respect and trust. Whenever anything went amiss with Engels, 
Marx would be seriously alarmed. His friend's illness in the 
summer of 1857 caused him a great deal of worry. 'Nothing could 
please me more than to hear that your health is progressing,' he 
wrote to Engels on 21 September that year, having heard that 
there were signs of an improvement (p. 173). 
Marx and Engels treated their comrades-in-arms with touching 
attention and great sensitivity. They grieved over the losses

unavoidable under the harsh conditions of life in emigration, and 
especially over the death of the proletarian poet Georg Weerth 
(see,  in particular, the letter from Engels to Marx, written not 
before 27 September 1856, and the letters from Marx to Lassalle, 
21 December 1857 and 22 February 1858). On the death of 
Conrad Schramm, an eminent member of the working-class 
movement, Engels wrote in sorrow to Marx on 25 January 1858: 
'Our old guard is rapidly dwindling away during this long spell of 
peace' (p. 253). Marx and Engels showed unfailing concern for 
their old comrades in the Communist League, and kept up 
friendly relations with Wilhelm Wolff (Lupus), Friedrich Lessner, 
Georg Eccarius, Joseph Weydemeyer, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Peter 
Imandt and others. 
The outstanding quality of Marx's relationship with his wife is 
illustrated by his remarkable love letter to Jenny Marx (21 June 
1856) in Trier, where she had gone to visit her dying mother.

Volume 40 contains 317 letters by Marx and Engels, of which 
307 were written in German and 10 in English. The great majority 
of the letters are being published in English for the first time. 
Only 73 appeared in English before (53 of these in incomplete 
form).  These publications are indicated in the notes. The 11 
letters by Jenny Marx included in the Appendix are given in 
English translation for the first time. The two letters by Karl Marx 
to Collet Dobson Collet written in June 1857 and Jenny Marx's 
letter to Engels of 31 July 1857 have never been published in any 
language before. 
The dating of some of the letters was ascertained in the course 
of the preparation of this volume. Information on undiscovered 
letters mentioned in the text will be found in the notes. If a fact or 
event is referred to in several letters, the same note number is 
used each time. 
Obvious slips in the text are corrected without comment. The 
authors' contractions of proper and geographical names and 
individual words are given in full. Defects in the manuscripts, 
where the text is missing or illegible, are indicated by three dots in 
square brackets. If the text allows a reconstruction of the missing 
or illegible passages, this is also given in square brackets. Anything 
crossed out by the authors is reproduced in the footnotes only 
where the disparity in meaning is considerable. If a letter is a 
rough copy, an extract quoted elsewhere, etc., this is marked 
either in the text itself or in the notes.

Dear Frederic, 
Today  I emptied  the 6th and  last medicine-BOTTLE. Pretty well 
again  on the  whole, save  for  persistent  and  highly perfidious 
piles. 
I haven't touched  on Cobden's pamphlet2  in my  ARTICLES,  because  I 
have devoted many tedious columns exclusively  to the  HISTORY  of the 
DANUBIAN PROVINCES  and Sweden.3  I should  be very glad  if you  would 
take on  Cobden. 
I shall  add a  short piece  to your article3  as soon  as I  have seen 
the 2nd  edition  of The  Times.  Its  ANNOUNCEMENT  yesterday  AS TO THE 
'UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE-4  was a  sheer Stock Exchange swindle which 
brought  it in a  great deal  of money. As early  as 1772,  at the Congress 
of Focgani,5 Catherine  II had  already proposed  to the  Turks THE 
INDEPENDENCE  OF THE PRINCIPALITIES UNDER THE COMMON PROTECTION  OF THE PRINCIPAL 
POWERS  OF EUROPE'.  At the Library b I discovered a work of Herrmann's 
which appeared  in Germany  in 184l.c  He  got hold  of a  manuscript of 
Field Marshal Münnich's  on the  Crimean campaign under Anna 6 in 
one of the  German libraries  and  published  it with  a foreword.  I shall 
make excerpts from  it for you if you are  interested. 
You may,  perhaps, have seen  in the  Augsburger  the high praise 
Fallmerayer accords  to Murait  for his  history  of Byzantium from 
the 6th to the 16th  century, which  won a  Petersburg Academy

Have seen Bruno3  again on various occasions. Romanticism 
increasingly turns out to be a 'prerequisite' for the critical 
criticism. In economics expresses enthusiasm for the Physiocrats, 
whom he misconstrues, and believes in the specifically beneficial 
effects of landed property. Moreover he rates very high the 
economic fantasies of Adam Müller, the German romantic. 7 In 
military science his summits princepsb  is the 'genius' Bülow. I told 
him that these latest disclosures of his had fully enlightened me 
regarding his arduous work of ratiocination. As TO RUSSIA he says 
that the old state of affairs in the West must be swept away and 
that this could only be done from the East, since the Easterner 
alone feels real hatred—for the Westerner, that is—and Russia is 
the only close-knit power in the East, BESIDES being the only 
country in Europe where there is still 'cohesion'. As to our 
illusions about internal class struggles, he maintains that 1. the 
workers feel no 'hatred'; 2. if they did feel hatred, they would 
never have achieved anything by it; 3. they are a 'rabble' (who 
have no interest in the Synoptics 8) and ought to be curbed and 
directed solely by force and cunning; 4. with tliem one silver 
groschen rise in pay is enough to settle 'the whole caboodle'. In 
any case, no one who was not a 'descendant of the conquerors' 
could play an historical role, except in the field of theory. And 
there something had doubdess been done during the past 16 
years,  though only in Germany and, indeed, by Bruno alone. It 
was thanks to him that 'scientific' theology had ceased to exist in 
Germany, the only place where it had existed, and that 'Tholuck was 
writing no longer'. Voilà un résultat immense! 1 In other respects, a 
pleasant old gendeman. Proposes to stay a year in England. I 
believe he is planning to introduce into England the 'scientific 
theology' which has ceased to exist in Germany. He declares 
Humboldt to be a complete ass because he has fraudulently 
arrogated to himself abroad the fame due to Bruno. 
You should write to old Harvey about your ears. He is also 
treating Linad from afar and, having heard that she is merely a 
GOVERNESS  in spef has not even charged her a centime. Herewith Lina's 
first report, which you should return. 
I am sending you a scrawl of Urquhart'sf which they sent me 
before the paper came out.9 The 'revelations' about the HISTORY  OF 
CHARTISM [are] INDEED highly naive, since Urquhart turns out to be 
a Bruno Bauer - b great exemplar - c  That's tremendous result. -  <• Caroline

Bonaparte  is VERY  FAST  ON THE  DECLINE.  That Drouyn  de Lhuys  is 
missing from  the  official list  of senators  for this year  you  will have 
seen,  but not, I  imagine, that recently, apropos  a sensational  act of 
opposition,  he left his  card  on an  Orleanist (Rémusat,  if I'm not 
mistaken) with  a bold line drawn through  the  title: vice-président  du 
Sénat. Recently,  the  infantry were called  out  against  the  students 
escorting Monsieur Nisard home.  At the cry:  Vive la ligne! 3 the 
troops ordered arms  and had to be  speedily withdrawn lest 
fraternisation should become  a fait accompli.  The  recent conspiracy 
in the  south-west,  on account  of which 5,000 arrests (according  to 
a Bonapartist statement) were made,  had  wide ramifications  in the 
army;  the NCO  school  at La Flèche  was completely disbanded. 
Almost  all the  students were implicated  and had to be  returned  to 
their regiments;  IN FACT,  it is  said  to have been very difficult  to find 
reliable regiments  to which they could  be posted. When Bonaparte 
was at the  Odéon recently with  his spouse, b the university students 
who filled  the pit  sang  the  Sire  de Franc Boissy 13 throughout  the 
evening, carefully intoning some  of the  more embarrassing bits.  In 
Paris  the  workers  are  singing  a little ditty, having  the  refrain: 
Voilà  qu'il part, voilà qu'il part, 
Le petit marchand  de moutarde, 
Voilà  qu'il part pour  son  pays 
Avec  tous  ses  outils. c 
In order that there should  be no  doubt about  the  identity  of the 
petit marchand  de moutarde,  the police have banned  the  song. d 
All these impudent manifestations  of oppositional  and  positively 
anti-Bonapartist impulses,  and Mr.  Bonaparte's corresponding 
feebleness  are  proof that  a great change  is under  way. The 
measures' adopted during  the  coup d'état l4 will  no longer  do, and 
the courage  to apply them  is no  longer there.  You  will have seen 
that even  The  Times,  on two  successive days, first described 
Napoleon personally  as a  mere stopgap  so far as  France  was 
concerned—BECAUSE  NOT ONE  SINGLE  MAN WAS TO BE  FOUND  IN WHICH  THE 
NATION  COULD PLACE ITS  CONFIDENCE  AND  ESTEEM  — and then characterised 
his entire general staff  of  ministers,  etc., as  swindlers  and 
scoundrels."  In today's Guardian there  is another nice story about

that rascal Fiorentino, Bonapartist court feuilletonist and Knight 
of the Legion of Honour. Mr Espinasse, too, had to decamp from 
Paris;  he has been involved in scandals, concerning which I shall 
probably hear more in a day or two. Something is also afoot with 
de Morny; the fellow has more or less fallen out with his worthy 
brother 2 and is once more intriguing on his own account. 
This Bonaparte, for whom in the past everything, however 
stupid, craven and infamous, turned out so well, will now discover 
that henceforward everything will go badly for him. This he is 
already discovering in the war and peace question; everyone 
blamed him for the war, no one thanks him for the peaceful turn 
of events. Incidentally, the matter of the peace is far from being 
setded. The preliminaries to the preliminaries contain, au fond, h 
nothing but the Bessarabian clause, and that is offset by a total 
disregard for Kars. 15 All the rest consists of nothing but bogus 
concessions. Moreover Bonaparte no longer cares a rap about the 
conditions upon which he makes peace. For him it is now his 
bread and butter that is at stake, as once with old Dolleschall, c and 
I'm convinced that the Russians know this better than he does 
himself.  Never before have the French been so wholly indifferent 
to their gloire; since 1848 the fellows have been concerned with 
other things than the traditional gloire and parliamentary 
swindling. 
So it seems as though we have safely weathered the Aliens 
Bill16 —au train que les choses  vont en France? there will soon be no 
further need to worry one's head about the aspirations of 
Palmerston and Co. The Bonapartist house of cards will most 
likely collapse this summer just as did Louis Philippe's in the year 
of scandal 1847, and exactly when the gust of wind comes that 
completely demolishes the walls is a matter of mere chance. I now 
lead a very sober life, but on that day I shall get drunk in 
Manchester, probably for the last time. 
Don't be long in telling me something more about old Brunoe; 
the fellow's new romantic turn is too amusing. Kindest regards to

and consequent DULLNESS of spirits. On top of which Pieper has just 
been playing me some music of the future. 17 C'est  affrevx h and 
makes one afraid of the 'future', including its poetical music. 
At the Museumc  I have made a number of historical discoveries 
about the end of the 17th and the early decades of the 18th 
centuries concerning the struggle between Peter I and Charles 
XII and the decisive role played in that drama by England. At that 
time the foreign policy of the Tories and Whigs differed quite simply 
in that the former sold themselves to France, the latter to Russia. 
This venality was taken for granted and is discussed and declared 'a 
matter of course' by contemporary writers. From the start, William 
III harboured  MISGIVINGS  about Sa Majesté Czarienne, d as is proved by 
his offensive and defensive treaty with Charles XII. Under him the 
ministers acted contrary to his inclination. From George I onwards 
things were easy for the Whigs since the  ELECTORS  of Hanover were 
already pursuing a foolish dynastic policy and regarded Verden and 
Bremen as the focal points of European interest. That mainly 
England contributed to turning Russia into a BALTIC POWER  is, perhaps, 
less interesting than the fact that, as early as the beginning of the 
18th century, this policy was already being denounced, and the 
future growth of the MUSCOVITE EMPIRE predicted with remarkable 
accuracy. Despite the unexampled indulgence of the official British 
and the direct aid they accorded Peter, the latter was at the same time 
engaging in underhand dealings with the Pretender. 6 In this his 
personal physician (Erskine), a relation of the Comte de Mar, acted 
as go-between. The main sources for the whole of this mysterious 
story are: 
a) Truth is Truth, as it is  timed,  or Our Ministry's present Measures 
against the Muscovite vindicated by Plain and Obvious reasons, tending 
a more or less - b It's horrible - c the British Museum Library - d His Imperial 
Majesty (Peter I) - e James Edward Stuart

g) and h) are, of course, well known to all historians who, 
however, lack the key to the proper understanding of the same. 
Both publications turn more especially on Charles XII's plan, 
conceived as an act of vengeance upon England, to land a Swedish 
army on the English coast and proclaim the Pretender. 
Besides these pamphlets there are a number of other writings 
which occasionally refer to the Swedish-English-Russian business, 
or English pamphlets obviously inspired by the Swedish ambas­
sador Gyllenborg, as, for instance, Remarks on Mr Jackson's 
Memorial etc. 
You can see what kind of means the Whigs resorted to from 
their having put it about 
* 'that the King of Sweden was a Roman Catholic and that the Czar was a good 
Protestant' *. 
No one can fail to notice that, at the very time the English were 
making such a ridiculous hullaballoo about Austria setting up the 
Compagnie des Indes at Ostend, they formally placed their fleet at 
Peter's disposal and helped him found his ports in the Baltic. Yet 
from the complaints of the English BALTIC  MERCHANTS  of that time it 
transpires that Monsieur Peter was very far from gentle with 
them. England was, moreover, the first great European power to 
recognize his imperial title, etc. What the above-mentioned 
pamphlets prove above all is that she was acting neither under an 
illusion nor out of ignorance. 
The following anecdotes about Peter from the Memoirs of 
Frederick the Great's Sistera will amuse you. Peter and the Czarina 
were paying them a visit at Potsdam.

'La Czarine débuta par baiser la main à la reine a qu'il voulut embrasser, mais 
elle le repoussa. Elle lui présenta ensuite le duc et la duchesse de Mecklenbourgb 
qui les avaient accompagnés et 400 soi-disant dames qui étaient à sa suite. C'était 
pour la plupart, des servantes allemandes, qui faisaient les fonctions de dames, de 
femmes de chambre, de cuisinières et de blanchisseuses. Presque toutes ces 
créatures portaient chacune sur les bras un enfant richement vêtu; et lorsqu'on 
leur demandait, si c'étaient les leurs, elles répondaient en faisant des salamalecs à la 
Russienne: Le Czar  m'a  fait l'honneur  de me faire  cet enfant.  La reine ne voulut pas saluer 
ces créatures' etc. c 
In one of the rooms at Potsdam there stood a Priapus 
'dans une posture très indécente. Le Czar admira cette statue beaucoup et 
ordonna à la Czarine de la baiser. Elle voulut s'en défendre, il se fâcha et lui dit en 
allemand corrompu: Kop ob.... La Czarine eût si peur qu'elle fit tout ce qu'il voulut. 
Il demanda sans façon cette statue et plusieurs autres au roi d qui ne put les lui

I should like to put to some use the curious items I have 
discovered at the Museum. They are too retrospective for a 
newspaper. So I shall try 'Putnam'. But first you must let me know 
when the 'IMPROVEMENTS IN MODERN  WARFARE'  can be ready, since Putnam 
will, of course, insist on having the goods he ordered first19 before 
he considers any fresh offers. 
I was most interested in the French business and would ask you 
to send me the Examiner whenever it contains similar  stuff.  Here 
the Guardian may be seen at Wylde's. Writing for the papers is at 
present very onerous, since nothing is happening in England and 
the turn economic affairs are taking is still far from clear. Crucial 
in this respect just now are the stock market swindles, concerning 
which the necessary material is wanting.

German servants fulfilling the dudes of ladies-in-waiting, chamber-maids, cooks and 
laundresses. Practically every one of these creatures carried a richly clad child in her 
arms;  and, when asked if it was hers, would reply, making salaams Russian-fashion:

these creatures' etc. - d Frederick William I - e  'in a most indecent posture. The Czar 
greatly admired this statue and commanded the Czarina to kiss it. When she 
demurred, he grew angry and said in bad German: "Kop ob...."  ["Head  off".] The

asking for this statue and a number of others which the King was unable to refuse him'

ruses  he  adopts.  The  fellows  are  keen  on  "grasping"  out of 
avarice. 
But the  great event,  the  event which  has  caused  me to  send this 
second epistle following hard  on the  heels  of the  first,  is the  Seiler 
event.  You  will recall what  the  auspices  for  this Sebastian 
Sheetanchor 3 looked like when last  you  were here.  The old 
GREENGROCER proved RATHER adamant,  and  Seiler  himself,  with  the 
happy instinct characteristic  of the man,  soon discovered that  it 
would  be altogether foolish  to lay out  some £200  on amortising 
the past rather than greasing  the  wheels  of the  future.  So he 
takes  the  heroic decision  to advise  his  father-in-law  not to pay 
one single creditor,  but  rather look  on unconcernedly should  he 
be locked  up. His  intention, then,  was to  pass through  the  COURT 
OF INSOLVENCY  and,  thus purged, start  a new  career with  the old 
man's help. This seemed very practical  to the old man.  Seiler 
for his  part  was  tempted  by the  prospect—once initiated into 
the crapuleuse b company  of the  Queen's Bench21 —of keeping 
open board thanks  to  generous supplies from wife  and 
mother-in-law  and,  incidentally,  of  completing  his  immortal 
work  on Alexander II—consisting  of extracts from  the  Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung, upon which  he has  spread  an equivocal syrup. 
The matter  was  AT  ONCE  put in  hand. There began  a golden 
era of farniente"  and 'business errands' into town.  But  what  was 
particularly embarrassing  was  that, despite  the  WARRANTS taken 
out against him and despite the  OSTENTATIOUS EXHIBITION  of 
his worthy person  in the  streets  of London,  not a  single 
creditor took steps  to  have Sebastian arrested.  The old 
GREENGROCER, whose faith  in the  'personality'  of his  son-in-law  was in 
no way  reinforced  by the  latter's inviolability, told  him the  time 
had come  to vacate  the  house  and  withdraw with  his  wife  to a 
distant COTTAGE. During  the  actual removal some  of the  effects were 
confiscated  by  vigilant creditors, among them  7 pairs  of boots 
belonging  to Sebastian. Sebastian himself took care that there 
should  be no  secret about  the  COTTAGE either, since  a quiet  and 
secluded existence with  his  cabbage  of a  wife  had no  place 
whatsoever  in his  plans.  In short,  to such good effect  did he 
intrigue with  the  cabbage,  the  mother-in-law  and the  GREENGROCER, 
that it has  been decided  to despatch  him to the 'New  World'— 
New York,  OF COURSE—whither  his  spouse  is to  follow  him  once  he 
has secured  a 'position'.  The  matter  now  turns—he  is expected  to

leave this week—on the number of £s he is to take with him for 
his travelling expenses. He is asking for £60. The GREENGROCER 
reckons that half as much will suffice. Sebastian plans, once in 
America, to extract one 5 pound note after the other from his 
dear spouse, to pamper his belly, to publish his Kaspar Hauser and 
Alexander II, and, as a grass widower, never to forego the 
sweet melancholy of separation from his cabbage. It would be 
interesting if a creditor did catch him after all. At all events he has 
succeeded in leaving England too as a 'financial' fugitive, only 
in more respectable CIRCUMSTANCES than those attending his depar­
ture from Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. His plan was 
that Pieper should go with him as companion. Pieper had only 
pretended to fall in with this plan so as to get a share of the 
7 pairs of boots, but in the event he was forestalled by the 
BROKERS. 
Pieper was here one evening not long ago giving lessons to the 
children when the POSTMAN knocked at the door downstairs. A letter 
for Pieper in a female hand. Invitation to a rendezvous. Since he 
was unfamiliar with the hand and equally with the signature, he 
gave himself over to great expectations and passed the letter to my 
wife to read. From the signature she at once recognised our 
ex-nurse, the fat old Irish slattern, who cannot write herself and 
therefore had the letter written by a third hand. You can imagine 
how we teased Fridolin* with our laughter. But he kept his 
rendezvous with the cow. Such, then, are his ADVENTURES. O King 
Visvamitra, what an ox you are! b

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 29 February 1856 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Engels, 
For the whole of this week I've had a visitor in the person of 
G. Levy from Düsseldorf, sent over as their delegate by the workers 
there. He only left yesterday and took up all my spare time, so that 
despite the best of intentions I did not succeed in writing to you. 
Further on I shall give you an account of the news, some of it 
important, of which he was the CARRIER. 3 
Not one of the 3 books you asked for was available at Norgate 
and Williams. I have ordered the Lay of Igor22 but wanted to let you 
know about the other two first. 
Dobrowsky's 'Slavin', Hanka edition, is very far from fulfilling the 
expectations aroused by its title. The book falls into 2 parts as 
regards the contents, if not the arrangement, viz.: 
1. Short ESSAYS on Slavonic linguistic studies which, in view of 
more recent studies, could at most be of antiquarian interest (e.g. 
sample from the Wendish New Testament, Slavonic declension, on 
the Slavonic translation of the Old Testament, etc.). 
2. An attempt, wholly devoid of polemic bite, to reconstitute the 
character of the Slav peoples in integrum}' This is done by taking 
excerpts from sundry works, mostly German writings. Here is a list 
of these essays, which make up the bulk of the bookc: 
'Slawische Völker'. (From Herder's Ideen d etc.) 
'Sitten der Croaten'. (From von Engels' Geschichte von Dalma­
tien, Croatien, Slavonien. Halle 1798.) 
'Sitten und Gebräuche der Illyrier, der Morlaken etc' (From 
ditto.) 
'Charakter der Illyrier'. (From Taube's Beschreibung des König­
reichs Slavonien. Leipzig 1777.) 
'Die Tracht der Illyrier'. (From Hacquet's Beobachtungen auf einer 
Reise nach Semlin. c) 
a See this volume, pp. 23-25. - b as a whole - c Here Marx gives the titles of a 
number of chapters from Dobrowsky's book and some excerpts from it. -

'Prokops Schilderung der Slawen und Anten'. (From Stritter's 
'Geschichte der Slawen nach den Byzantinern' in Schlözer's 
Allgemeine Nordische Geschichte.) 
'Auszüge aus des Herrn Professor B. Hacquet's Abbildung und 
Beschreibung der Südwest- und östlichen Slawen'. 
'Volkstümliches der Russen'. (From Dupré de St. Maure, 
Observations sur les moeurs et les usages russes. Paris 1829. 3 vols.) 
'Charakter und Kultur der Slawen im Allgemeinen'. (From 
Schaffarik, Geschichte der slawischen Sprache, etc. Ofen a 1826.) 
That's about all. Appended is 'Der böhmische Cato' in Czech, 
'from an old manuscript described by the late Voigt in Acta 
litter aria'. 23 
Dobrowsky writes in a bumbling, good-natured, naive style, with 
the greatest cordiality towards his German colleagues, whether 
'late'  or still living. All that seemed of interest to me in the Slavin 
were a few passages in which he directly recognises the Germans 
as the fathers of Slavonic historical and linguistic studies. 
As regards linguistic studies, he cites among others 'Schlözer, 
Vorschlag zu einer allgemeinen vergleichenden slawischen Sprachlehre 
und Wörterbuch'. 24 Further, 'Schlözer, Vorschlag, das Russische 
vollkommen richtig und genau mit lateinischer Schrift auszudrücken'. In 
general 'Herr Hofrat Schlözer' would appear to be the patriarch 
of whom the others profess to be the disciples. 
'Schlözer's Nestor: A work indispensable to anyone wishing to acquaint himself 
with the critical approach to Slavonic history in general and the Russian annals in 
particular.' 
Of Voigt's Geschichte Preussens: 
'Was the first to acquaint the Bohemians with the monuments of Antiquity.'25 
Also cited: 
'Johann Leonhard Frischen's Programmen von der slawischen 
Literatur', 1727-1736, 
'which has elucidated the history of several Slavonic dialects'. 
'Slawischer Bücherdruck in Würtenberg im löten Jahrhundert. Ein 
literarischer Bericht von Chr. Friedr. Schnurrer,  Prof.  in Tübingen, 
1799'— 
'a very valuable book which contains the finest and most important contribu­
tions to the history of Wendish and Croat bibliography'. 
Others cited are: Schlözer, Allgemeine Nordische Geschichte. Joli.

Of all these works only the titles are given, with the exception of 
the opinions extracted above. Voilà le 'Slavin'!' 
As regards the 3rd work, the tide is: Dr. M. W. Heffter, Der 
Weltkampf der Deutschen und Slaven seit dem Ende des 5ten 
Jahrhunderts, 1847 (costs 7/-). Even in his preface the author admits 
that he only has a detailed and first-hand knowledge of Slavonic 
history in so far as it refers to the Prussian 'Fatherland'. More than 3/4 
of his book of 481 pages is devoted to the period between the end of 
the 5di century and 1147. Only here and there does the remainder 
go beyond the 13th, or at latest the 14th, century, and then quite 
cursorily. 
Having given you an opinion on these two works, I await your 
instructions whether or not to order them. Another book by 
Heffter has been published: Das Slawentum, Leipzig 1852 (45 
pages or so). Constitutes the 10th booklet in the Brockhaus series 
Unterhaltungen, Belehrungen etc? A popular compendium of 
Slavonic history. It was from this little book I learned that in 1849 
Nicholas issued a ukase by which 
'all his subjects were strictly forbidden to take part in Pan-Slavism'. 
At the Museum I discovered, and made extracts from, 5 
manuscript folio volumes on Russia (18th century only). They are 
part of the literary legacy of ARCHDEACON Coxe, known for his zeal 
as a collector.26  They contain many original (hitherto unpublished) 
letters from English ambassadors in Petersburg to the Cabinet 
here,  some of them VERY COMPROMISING INDEED. Amongst the papers 
dated 1768 there is a manuscript by one of the Embassy attachés 
on 'the character of the Russian nation'. d I shall send you 
some extracts from it. There is also interesting information 
on the Russian 'artels' by the Embassy chaplain, a cousin of 
Pitt's. e

Although anti-Russian, recent French writings are, with few 
exceptions, almost all tinged with Pan-Slavism. Thus Desprez," but 
more particularly Cyprien Robert who, in Paris in 1848, published 
the journal, La Pologne. Annales contemporaines des peuples de 
l'Europe orientale, etc. The same man has published, among other 
things, Les Slaves de la Turquie, édition de 1844, précédée d'une 
introduction, etc., 8°, Paris 1852. Further, Le Monde slave, son passé, 
son état présent et son avenir, Paris 1852. A Parisian author, b whose 
nom de guerre is Edmond, but who is said to be a Pole, is 
exceptional in having published an exceedingly venomous attack 
on Russian pretensions to socialism, and comments on their 
communes, etc. I haven't yet been able to trace this, but shall have 
a look at the Revue des deux Mondes which apparently contains 
extracts from it. 
I began this letter today with the intention of sending you 
masses of gossip. But, having strayed off in another direction and 
time being short, I shall leave that till tomorrow and confine 
myself for today to telling you that Heise, under the influence of 
strong liquor (so Imandt writes), is rapidly approaching his end 0; 
that Oswald—of tobacco and refugee fame—who doesn't speak a 
word of French, has been appointed Professor of the French 
Language at UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, London; that Ruge's friends are 
putting it around that he's suffering from 'dropsy' though it's 
probably nothing but water on the brain; that a number of 
German worthies (Faucher, Meyen, Franck, Tausenau, etc.) will 
be meeting tomorrow chez mine host Kerb, in order to achieve 
an entente cordiale as to the Fatherland's requirements, and that 
'Meyen' has expressed the 'hope' that he can persuade Bûcher to 
'take part' in this confabulation; finally, that Proudhon has become 
a director of the royal imperial French railways.

IN MANCHESTER 
[LondonJ 5 March 1856 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
DEAR  Frederic, 
Next week I shall take a closer look at the Heffter.3  If there's 
anything to it, I shall order it. Eichhoff's Histoire de la langue et de 
la littérature des Slaves, Paris 1839, is very poor indeed. Apart from 
the grammatical section, which I'm unable to assess (but I notice 
that the Lithuanians and Letts are said to be Slavs. Isn't that 
NONSENSE?), the rest is mostly plagiarisms from Schaffarik. b The 
fellow also gives samples of the Slavs' vernacular poetry in the 
original, together with a French translation. Indeed, it was 
amongst these that I found Igor's expedition.22  In essence, the 
poem is a call for unity on the part of the Russian princes just 
before the invasion by the Mongol hordes proper. The poem 
contains a curious passage, 'Voici les jolies filles des Gothes 
entonnent leurs chants au bord de la Mer noire'. c From this it 
would seem that the Getae or Goths celebrated the victory of the 
Turkish Polovtsians 27 over the Russians. The whole poem is 
epic-Christian, although heathen elements are still strongly in 
evidence. The Bohemian epic Zaboi (Samo?), in the anthology of 
Bohemian epic poetry in a German translation published by Hanka 
and Swoboda?8 is, on the other hand, fairly polemical and 
fanatically anti-German. Appears to be directed against a German 
capitano of Dagobert's who was beaten by the Bohemians. But it is 
a call for vengeance as much upon Christianity as upon the 
Germans, who are reproached in the most naively poetical terms 
with having, amongst other things, sought to compel the worthy 
Bohemians to be satisfied with only one wife. Other folk poetry I 
discovered (the Poles have none save for Adalbert's Prayer to the 
Mother of God29) are:

Jahrhunderts.... - b P. J. Schaffarik, Geschichte der slawischen Sprache und Literatur nach

There have even been duels between the two sides, and today the 
Neue Preussische Zeitung carries a LEADER' roundly declaring that 
there are 'depraved scoundrels' in its party just as there are very

Gironde'  2 and to  consider that 'peace  or no  peace,  for  Prussia 
there lies ahead  a time  of very great confusion,  at home  or abroad' 
and that  at this moment  a 'party split' means 'suicide'. Capital,  is it 
not? And  withal  no one in  Prussia cares  a rap  about  the  Chamber 
and its splits.  All the  more significant, then, this admission  of fear. 
Father  Leo  delivered  a lecture before  the  King a on Münzer (part 
of which  was  printed  in the  Neue Preussische h). One  might almost 
think  it was a  direct riposte  to your essay  in the  Revue  der Neuen 
Rheinischen Zeitung. 0 Essential,  of course, that  the  Reformation  be 
absolved  of the  responsibility  of having given birth  to the 
Revolution. Münzer  was a 'fanatic'  who  said: 'inteUigo  ut credam'. d 
Luther said: 'credo  ut intelligam'.e  The  Spenersche's* reply  was  that 
in his later years Luther repented,  etc., of the  abject role  he had 
played  in politics.  As you see, the  ferment  is at  work even  in 
official circles. 
Apropos  the  Reformation,  it was  Austria  who,  from  the  start, 
laid the  foundations  of the  Slav peril  at a  time when  all races save 
the Russian were inclined  to support  the  Reformation. With  the 
Reformation came  the  translation  of the  Bible into  all the  popular 
Slav dialects.  And  thereby  of course awakening national conscious­
ness.  On the  other hand, deep-rooted alliance with  the  German 
Protestant North.  Had  Austria  not  suppressed this movement, 
Protestantism would have provided  not  only  the  foundations  for 
the dominance  of the  German spirit,  but  also  and  equally, 
bulwarks against Greek-Orthodox Russia.  Not a  pitfall  but  Austria 
has driven  the  Germans into  it and, in  Germany  as in the  East,  she 
paved  the way for the  Russians.

yesterday, poor Evans made amende  honorable.*  That there was a 
betrayal at Kars would seem to be pretty clear from the written 
account of a certain Swan, b recently returned from the East—a 
betrayal which took place not during the last few days but earlier, 
in order to bring the situation about. 
Now for Seiler. Threatened with prosecution by the SHERIFF, he 
set off for America some 3 weeks ago by the Southampton STEAMER, 
fully intending on arrival in Halifax to telegraph the New-Yorker 
Staatszeitung (for which he once wrote) as follows: 'Sebastian Seiler, 
the famous author of Kaspar Hauser, has landed safely on the west 
coast of the Atlantic Ocean.' The great man left behind his 
Alexander II, 55 pages, mostly extracts from the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung, one copy of which was to be sent on 
immediately in his wake. For it is to appear on both sides of the 
Atlantic. This gossipy rubbish he surrounded with a great deal of 
humbug, having parts of it copied out by his wife, sister-in-law, 
etc., so that one and all they were astounded by POOR Sebastian's 
untiring industry. Negotiations with the London booksellers over 
this Alexander II served to give a veneer of erudition to his 
'business errands' to town where every day he carefully investi­
gated the quality of the LOBSTER and suchlike, not forgetting the 
French 'omelette'. Besides this Alexander, he has left other 
unpleasant surprises behind. You will remember that Liebknecht 
signed a bill for him, lured on by the foolish hope that. Seiler 
would deduct a few pounds in his favour from the amount 
discounted. The bill fell due but was not presented. Seiler made 
out that he had paid it. He had only renewed it. Two days after 
he left, Liebknecht got a letter from a lawyer in the City requiring 
him to pay the bill. Pieper, whom Seiler's green-bespectacled 
sister-in-law loves for the sake of his glassy eyes, was despatched to 
the GREENGROCER. Consternation in the FAMILY. For Sebastian had 
already received the money to pay the bill, but had poured it 
down his gullet. Love, however, overcomes all obstacles, and his 
wife is convinced that she can lay claim to love only once, and then 
only from Sebastian. Hence she is trying to arrange matters. But 
the GREENGROCER  is grave and glum, becoming daily more enlight­
ened as to the WHEREABOUTS OF HIS DEAR SON-IN-LAW. The thing is still 
pending. Meanwhile fresh bills, allegedly honoured, keep arriving 
every day.

1. Denunciation of Lassalle. And, having considered the matter 
very carefully, I think they are right. Since the countess 3 got her 
300,000 talers, 35 Lassalle has changed completely; deliberately 
repulsing the workers, a sybarite, coquetting with the Blues. b He is 
further accused of having constandy exploited the party for his 
filthy personal ends and wanting to make use of the workers 
themselves for personal crimes in the interests of the law-suit. The 
law-suit ended as follows: Count Hatzfeldt's head clerk, Stockum 
who,  as you know, was subsequently sentenced at the Assizes to 5 
years'  penal servitude, had quarrelled with the count. He gave 
Lassalle to understand that he had in his possession documents 
which could have the count put in chains for perjury, forgery, etc. 
Lassalle promises him 10,000 talers. On the other hand, Lassalle 
persuades Kösteritz, the Chief Public Prosecutor (who has been 
compelled to resign as a result of this affair), to let Count 
Hatzfeldt know that there's a bill of indictment hanging over his 
head. Hatzfeldt is making a bolt for Paris when Lassalle hands him 
the incriminating documents in return for his signing the settlement 
with the countess, and withdraws the bill of indictment. (Kösteritz, 
of course, was acting purely as his INSTRUMENT.) Hence it was not his 
legal acumen that brought the law-suit to a sudden close, but a 
quite vulgar intrigue. Lassalle did not pay Stockum the 10,000 
talers,  and the workers are right in saying that such a breach of 
faith would be excusable only if he had handed over the money to 
the party instead of fraudulendy keeping it for the countess. They 
report a host of personal dirty tricks which I cannot repeat 
because too many to remember. For instance, Lassalle gambled in 
foreign government paper with Scheuer of Düsseldorf, who 
advanced him the money for the purpose. They lost. Meanwhile 
Scheuer went bankrupt. Lassalle wins the law-suit. Scheuer 
demands the money he advanced Lassalle. The latter contemptu­
ously draws his attention to §6 of the Code, which forbids gam­
bling on foreign Exchanges. The workers say they turned a blind 
eye to everything done by Lassalle because of his plea that he was 
involved in the law-suit for reasons of honour. Now, having won, 
instead of getting the countess to pay him for his work and 
achieving independence, he is, they say, living shamefully under 
her thumb as homme entretenu, 0 WITHOUT  ANY  PRETEXT WHATEVER. He had 
always boasted about what he would do as soon as the law-suit had 
been won and now he was casting them aside, deliberately and 
defiantly, as redundant instruments of no further use. He had

attended one more (private) meeting on New Year's Day because a 
French colonel was present. To everyone's astonishment, he 
addressed 60 working-men exclusively on the subject of 'the 
struggle of civilisation against barbarism', the Western Powers 
versus Russia. Apparently he had planned to go to Berlin, play the 
grand gendeman there and open a salon. On his return, he 
promised the countess in Levy's presence to set up 'a court of 
literati' for her. Likewise in Levy's presence, he was constandy 
reiterating his 'dictatorial aspirations', etc., etc. (he seems to see 
himself quite differendy from the way we see him, regarding 
himself as able to subdue the world because of his ruthlessness in 
a private intrigue, as though a man of real worth would sacrifice 
10 years to such a bagatelle). An instance, by the by, of how 
dangerous he can be: in order to smuggle a labour party man into 
the police, ostensibly as a spy, he gave him one of my Utters witfi 
instructions to say he had stolen it from Lassalle to establish his 
credibility. The workers further say that, being the diplomat he is, 
he would not have behaved so brusquely towards them had it not 
been his direct intention to go over to the bourgeois party. At the 
same time, he believes his influence is such that if he climbed onto 
a table at a moment of insurrection and harangued the masses, 
etc., he could talk them round. According to Levy, he is so much 
hated that, whatever we might decide, the workers would massacre 
him should he be in Düsseldorf at the moment of action. They 
are, by the by, convinced that he would lose no time in placing 
himself at the disposal of the other side should he hear of 
anything suspicious. 
These are nothing but isolated points, deduced from what I 
heard, and only partially retained. The whole thing made a distinct 
impression on myself and Freiligrath, however prejudiced in 
Lassalle's favour and mistrustful of workers' tittle-tattle I may have 
been. I told Levy that it was, of course, impossible to reach any 
conclusion on the strength of a report from one side only; 
suspicion was in place whatever the circumstances; they should 
continue to keep an eye on the man but for the time being avoid 
any public row; we might perhaps find some opportunity of 
forcing Lassalle to make his position clear, etc., etc. 
Qu'en pensez-vous?3  I should like to have Lupus' opinion too.

information on how things stand with the workers in the Rhine 
Province. The Düsseldorf workers are still in contact with the

Cologne people, amongst whom there are no longer any 
'gentlemen'. But those chiefly concerned with propaganda are now 
the factory workers in Solingen, Iserlohn and district, Elberfeld and the 
ducal-Westphalia area. In the iron districts the fellows are all for 
force, and are held back only by the prospect of a French 
revolution and the fact that 'the Londoners think the time is not 
yet ripe'. 36 If the thing drags on much longer Levy believes that a 
rising will be difficult to prevent. But whatever the circumstances, 
an insurrection in Paris would be the signal. These people seem to 
be firmly convinced that we and our friends would instantly hasten to 
join them. They naturally feel the need for political and military 
leaders. Not that one can in any way blame the chaps for that. But 
I fear that, with their exceedingly artless plans, they would be 
smashed to smithereens before we had so much as a chance of 
leaving England. At all events, we owe it them to point out exactly 
what is and what isn't feasible from the military point of view. I 
have,  OF COURSE, declared that, circumstances permitting, we would 
range ourselves with the Rhenish workers; that any uprising, 
undertaken off their own bat, without prior initiatives in Paris or 
Vienna or Berlin, would be idiotic; that, should Paris give the 
signal, it would be advisable, whatever the circumstances, to risk 
all, since then even the ill-effects of a momentary defeat could 
themselves be no more than momentary; that I and my friends 
would seriously consider what direct action might be taken by the 
working population of the Rhine Province, and that in due course 
they should again send someone to London, but do nothing 
without prior agreement. 
The tanners of Elberfeld (or Barmen?) who were pretty 
reactionary in 1848 and '49, are now particularly eager for 
revolution. Levy assures me that the workers in the Wupper valley 
regard you, personally, as 'their' man. It would seem, by the way, 
that on the Rhine the belief in a revolution in France is fairly 
widespread, and even the philistines are saying: 'This time it will 
be different from 1848. This time there'll be people like 
Robespierre, etc., instead of the chatter-boxes of 1848.' On the 
Rhine at least, democracy's reputation has sunk very  LOW.

Dear Marx, 
Much obliged to you for your exhaustive letter ad Slavica? 
Eichhoff is already known to me as a philological quack who has 
actually out-quacked Klaproth (who did know something). I shall 
look into the business of the Goths in Igor 22 as soon as I have got 
the book. However, it has been established that a number of Goths 
remained in the Crimea until the 10th, and possibly the 11th, 
century; at least they figure as Goths in Byzantine [sources]. Could 
you let me know the title and price of Hanka and Swoboda's 
Bohemian anthology?28  It is sure to be highly uncritical, for they 
are both complete asses.—Polish folk songs were published 
somewhere or other during the 40s.—  I have found quotations 
from Götze, Wladimir, b etc., in Grimm's translation of Wuk's 
Serbische Grammatik with the comment 'unfortunately without the 
Russian text'. Kapper is a Prague Jew who published his 
Südslavische Wanderungen in the Bohemian constitutionalist paper c 
in 1848/49. He's a writer of belles lettres, but whether his 
translations are any good I couldn't say— j'en doute cependant. 6 All 
the Serbian wedding songs have been translated by the Jakob 
woman. e The political works you mention on the Hungarian and 
Turkish Serbs might be worth looking at if they are in the 
Museum/ 
The Neue Preussische Zeitung isn't available in Manchester, but I 
followed the Pfeil business in the Kölner and the Augsburger s and 
derived much joy from it. However the penitent LEADER in the 
N. Pr.h  was, of course, new to me; really too delightful, the sudden 
discovery that despite all the feudal gewgaws, nobility and 
bourgeoisie are today au fond'  one.

Protestantism has survived in Slovakia, and has greatly contributed 
to the inaction of the Slovaks against the Hungarians,3 while in 
Bohemia every serious national movement other than the pro­
letarian will in addition receive a strong admixture of Hussite 
historical memories which in turn will weaken the specifically 
national element. Pity about the Slovenian peasants who fought so

Lassalle. It would be a pity about the fellow because of his great 
ability, but these goings-on are really too bad. He was always a 
man one had to keep a devilish sharp eye on and as a real Jew 
from the Slav border was always to exploit anyone for his own 
private ends on party pretexts. And then his urge to push his way 
into polite society, de parvenir," 1 if only for appearance's sake, to 
disguise the greasy Breslau Jew with all kinds of pomade and 
paint was always repulsive. However all these were simply things 
which made it necessary to keep a sharp eye on him. But if he gets 
up to the kind of tricks that will actually result in his changing 
parties, I can't blame the Düsseldorf workers for the hatred they 
have conceived against him. I shall go and see Lupus this evening 
and put the matter to him. None of us ever trusted Lassalle but 
we did, of course, protect him against stupidities emanating from 
H. Bürgers. To my mind, everything should be allowed to 
proceed in the manner you prescribed for the Düsseldorfers. If he 
can be induced to commit a direct and  OVERT  ACT against the party, 
then we shall have him. But as yet there would seem to be none of 
that and in any case a row would be quite out of place.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] Tuesday [25 March 1856] 37 
Dear Engels, 
In one of my next letters I shall reply to your last. Today simply 
an inquiry, to which I should like, if possible, an answer by return. 
I did not send any article to the Tribune today because I hadn't 
finished reading the  BLUE  BOOK 39 on Kars 3—J only got hold of it 
late yesterday evening. I have to send off my articleb on Friday, at 
the same time as the one I am expecting from you. Well, ad remc: 
A large part of the BLUE BOOK is of a purely military nature; you 
will be able to see later whether anything can be done with it. But 
there's one point on which I want your critical OPINION, since it is 
also material to the political-diplomatic aspect of the matter and I 
have got to discuss it in this Friday's article. At the end of June the 
Turks proposed to send reinforcements to Redoute-Kaleh d in order 
to operate from there in the direction of Kutais,e  etc. The British 
government, on the other hand, wanted to send a relief force to 
Erzerum via Trebizond and, it seems, to abandon Kars as a place 
of little importance, regarding Erzerum as the centre of resistance. 
At all events this dispute meant that the moment propitious for 
action was irretrievably lost. So that you may be FULLY informed on 
the QUESTION I append here the crucial EXTRACTS. 
Stratford de Redcliffe to Clarendon. 28th June, 1855. 
*'The Turkish ministers, who had talked of sending 10,000 men from 
Batoum f to Erzeroum, now, in their embarrassment, incline to another plan. They 
propose to form an entrenched camp at Redoute-Kaleh, and to concentrate there 
the corps of General Vivian—completed by a draft of 10,000 men from the 
Bulgarian army—that of General Beatson, and the detachment from Batoum, 
reduced to 7,000 men. The total of these combined forces would be about 30,000 
of all arms. Stationary they might operate as a diversion in favour of the army at 
Kars or Erzeroum; advancing by Kutais or Georgia they might either attack the 
Russians in the rear or force them to retreat.'*

*'The meeting which I had previously announced, took place this morning at 
the Grand Vizier's3  house on the Bosphorus. In addition to his Highness, the 
Seraskier b and Fuad Effendi were present. I was accompanied by Brigadier-
General Mansfield.... It appears, that the Russians advancing from Gumri c with an 
amount of force varying from 20-30,000, had presented themselves before Kars; 
that a partial engagement of Cavalry had taken place, followed two days later by an 
attack, which had been repulsed, on the part of the enemy, and that the town was 
threatened with a siege.... It was clear, to all present, that whether the Russians 
besieged or turned Kars, the Turkish army required an effort to be made for its 
relief with all practicable despatch, and that of 3 possible modes of acting for that 
purpose, the only one likely to prove effective was an expedition by Kutais into 
Georgia. To send reinforcements by Trebizond would be at best a palliative. To 
establish an entrenched camp at Redoute-Kaleh, would, at this unhealthy season, be 
equivalent to consigning the troops to destruction. The real question was, whether 
a force numerically sufficient, and in all respects effective, could be collected in 
time at Kutais to make an excursion into Georgia and threaten the communications 
of the Russian army.... The Turkish ministers proposed that the expeditionary 
force should be composed of 12,000 men from Batoum and the neighbouring 
stations; of the troops made over to General Vivian, and estimated at 10,000 of all 
amis;  of General Beatson's Irregular Cavalry, of 10,000 men to be detracted from 
the army in Bulgaria as the complement of the Turkish contingent; of  5,000  more 
derived from the same source; of an Egyptian regiment of horse now here, and of 
another regiment expected from Tunis. To these the Seraskier proposed to add 
2,000 Albanians by way of riflemen. These several forces ... would present a total 
of 44,000 men, not perhaps to be reckoned with prudence at more than 36,000 
effectives.' *

* '...the proposed diversion at Redoute-Kaleh originated with the Porte.'* 
Clarendon to Stratford de Redcliffe. July 13th, 1855. 
*'...Her Majesty'sd government are of opinion, that the wiser course would be 
to send reinforcements to the rear of the Turkish army, instead of sending an 
expedition to the rear of the Russian army. The reinforcements might go to 
Trebizond, and be directed from thence upon Erzeroum. The distance from 
Trebizond to Erzeroum is less than that from Redoute-Kaleh to Tiflis,e  and the 
march is through a friendly instead of through a hostile country; and at Erzeroum 
the army would meet supporting friends instead of opposing enemies, and supplies 
instead of famine. If the army at Kars cannot maintain that position against the 
Russians, [...] it will be easier to defeat them by the whole force collected, than by 
divided portions of that force; and a defeat would be the more decisive, the further 
it took place within the Turkish frontier. Trebizond is a place where supplies of all 
kinds might be landed etc' *

operations,  and if the  Turkish army  of Kars  and Erzeroum cannot hold  out at the

be reinforced.'*

General Vivian  and  General Beatson's Horse,  Her  Majesty's government abide  by 
their opinion that they should  be directed through Trebizond  or Erzeroum.'* 
Lord Panmure to General Vivian, 14th July, 1855. 
*'...I place such full reliance  on your professional ability, that  I feel no anxiety 
lest you  should undertake  any  expedition  of a  nature  so wild  and  ill-digested  as 
that contemplated  by the  Porte....  A coup  de main  by means  of suddenly throwing 
an army  on the  coast  to threaten,  or even  to attack  an enemy's stronghold,  is one 
thing,  but a  deliberate expedition  to invade  an enemy's country,  and on his own 
territory  to make  war  upon  him, is  quite another.'* 
I must confess that Clarendon's strategy strikes me as curious in 
the extreme, as does also the fine distinction drawn by Lord 
Panmure Carnot favouring the Sevastopol 'coup de main' against the 
Turkish plan for a strategic move in Georgia. 
If possible, then, an answer to these points by return.

MARX TO ENGELS 20 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 10 April 1856 
DEAR  Frederic, 
It is high time I wrote again. I've been prevented from doing so 
by all kinds of domesticities. 
Enclosed 1 letter from Levy to me, from  Düsseldorf.  The 
Touroute mentioned in> the letter is a French ex-colonel. He called

yesterday while  I was out and so I  shall  not be  seeing  him for 
several days  as he has  gone  to  Liverpool.  He had a  longish 
conversation with  my  wife,  the  quintessence  of which  is contained 
in enclosure  2,sg  composed  by  Madame  herself.  The M.  mentioned 
in Levy's letter  is Miquel. 
In a few  days' time  you  will receive Igor,22 which  has now 
arrived; Russian-German; the  BLUE BOOK3 ; Destrilhes, Confidences 
sur la Turquie  and a  cutting from L'Homme, which  I have mislaid 
and hence cannot send today,  viz. a  letter from  a déporté  in 
Cayenne, Tassilier  by  name,  to M. le  Ministre  de la  Marine, b in 
which  the  frightful abominations  to which Boustrapa 40 subjects  the 
deportees  are  revealed.41  You  would have  had the  BLUE BOOK  long 
ago but  d'abordc  the  PRESSURE  of daily events  has  several times 
compelled  me to  suspend work  on my  articles'1  on this subject  and 
write about other themes,  so that  I was  unable  to do  without  the 
book. Then  the  friends whom  you  know arrived. They wanted  to 
have  the  NOVELTY  just  for one day, and had not yet  returned  it a 
week later. 
As TO  THESE KARS PAPERS,  The Times, in three fulminating  LEADERS, 6 
gave  a rehash  of the  section covering August  1854 to  ABOUT 
February 1855,  i.e. did not so  much  as touch  on the  really interesting 
and crucial period.  The  object  of this  is, of  course,  to shift  all 
RESPONSIBILITY  from  the  Ministry onto Redcliffe  and the  Turkish 
pashas  in Asia.  The  best  of it is  that  the  English government,  as 
you will  see  from Destrilhes, forcibly kept  at the  helm Redcliffe's 
rotten Turkish ministry, thus partly condoning  and  partly 
bringing about  the  abominations  of  which Williams complains. 
That, however,  is only  a minor matter.  By a  procedure similar  to 
the one  used  in Stieber's casef —namely,  by  producing proof  of 
FALSIFIED DATES  AND  FORGED PASSAGES—I  have, in my view, proved 
irrefutably that  the  responsibility  for  planning  the  fall of Kars  and 
for the  systematic execution  of  that plan,  lay  with  the  British 
GOVERNMENT,  which furthermore  had the  good fortune this time  to 
figure  in Bonaparte's eyes  as zealous  'in the  cause'.  I have  not,  OF 
COURSE,  gone into the military aspect proper, i.e. the  DEFENCE OF KARS; 
I have some  MISGIVINGS,  however, about  the  'stature'  of Williams.

Jones,  to whom I have shown my manuscript, intends IF 
POSSIBLE—i.e.  if he can get together enough money to take St. 
Martin's Hall 3—to LECTURE on the FALL OF KARS at the said venue 
before the debate on it in Parliament begins. 
* There is now going on a bitter controversy between the 
Chartists and the Urquhartites at Newcastle upon Tyne, London, 
Birmingham, and several other places.*42 As you will have heard, 
Jones,  with Finlen for shadow, has proclaimed himself dictator of 
Chartism and set up a new organisation which, INDEED, is in process 
of growing but has, on the other hand, evoked a great storm of 
indignation against him.43 
The 'speculation upon speculation'—not in ideas but in shares— 
which has invaded the Rhine Province and Berlin from France 
would appear to be proliferating as viciously there as on the other 
side of the Rhine. Jeremiads about this social MISCHIEF, this 
infatuation, are appearing in the Ministry's Preussische Correspon­
dent, in which the imminence of an 'inevitable' and general 
financial crisis is  SERIOUSLY  AND EMPHATICALLY  hinted at. 
You will know about Heine's death, but not about Ludwig 
Simon of Trier pissing—passing water, I mean—on his grave in 
the New York Neue Zeit run by Löwe, quondam lion b of the 
Parliament of the 'Cherman' Nation44 after its retreat to Stuckert.c 
This poet or minnesinger of the female Yid, Madame 
Hohenscheisse-esche or-linden of Frankfurt am Main, is naturally 
of the opinion that Heine was no poet; he had 'no sensibility', was 
full of 'malevolence' and calumniated not only Kobes I,d but even 
Berne'se lady friend, the great Berne's 'mouse', muse or moose— 
the Strauss woman.' 
Down here there is A SOCIETY  FOR THE  PROTECTION  OF SMALL  TRADESMEN. 
This  SOCIETY  publishes a weekly ragg  for the said protection. In that 
weekly our friend Seiler 'along with his wife' is pilloried as a 
'SWINDLER'. 
BUT greater things are afoot. Pieper, thanks to his genius, has 
again been living a freebooter's existence since January and, 
despite the not inconsiderable  SUBSIDIES  provided by me, has been 
daily on the qui vive vis-à-vis his LANDLADY. NOW it has suddenly 
occurred to him that all he requires to become a great man is a 
a a venue of public gatherings in London. The inaugural meeting of the International 
Working  Men's Association was held there in September 1864. - b Löwe von

litde capital. Seiler's  SISTER-IN-LAW,  die  GREENGROCER'S  2nd daughter, a 
tallow-candle  in green spectacles,  has  long been mortally  in love 
with the  said Pieper.  Her  entire person green like verdigris rather 
than veg., and  GREENS  to boot without  ANY  MEAT  or FLESH  WHATEVER. 
While declaring  her to be  ugly  as the  day,  Pieper  has  nevertheless 
discovered that  she is not  without intelligence,  of which  she  gives 
incontrovertible proof  by  regarding  our  Hanoverian lambkin  as a 
German Byron manqué.  So, the day  before yesterday, therefore, 
Pieper,  to whom this person clings,  not  simply like  a burr  but  like 
a CATERPILLAR,  resolved  to pour  out his  heart  to Seiler's father-in-
law. He did not  wish  to do so in  front  of his  'beloved'  for  fear  he 
might have  to kiss her,  which indeed  is HARD WORK  for an occidental 
unaccustomed  TO  FEED  UPON  TALLOW.  But in true Pieper- fashion, the 
declaration  of love  was  combined with—a touch  for a  loan. Pieper 
could  not  disburden  his  heart  to the  GREENGROCER  without inviting 
the GREENGROCER  to disburden his  POCKETS,  not to say his till. On the 
grounds, that  is, of his  needing  a litde capital,  SAY »MO POUNDS, TO 
CREATE  HIMSELF  A POSITION  as a  FASHIONABLE  tutor. Meanwhile he intends 
to let his  'beloved' enjoy  the  pleasures  of widowhood while still 
betrothed,  nor  will his  compassion ever permit  him to  marry  her. 
GREENS  or no  GREENS,  die whole business is most unsavoury, but 
Pieper imagines  he  will come  out of it as a  man  of honour,  i.e.  AT A 
CERTAIN  EPOCH  LOOMING IN THE FUTURE  repay down to the last farthing the 
advances  he  'hopes'  to obtain from  his  would-be father-in-law, 
generously leaving  him his  daughter into  the  bargain. Since that 
fateful  day he has  been back  to my  house only once,  for a  minute, 
while  I was out.  Called himself  a 'happy  man'.  Litde Jenny called 
him  'BENEDICK  THE  MARRIED MAN',*  but litde Laura said:  'BENEDICK WAS  A 
WIT, HE IS  BUT  -A' CLOWN-,  AND  -A CHEAP CLOWN-  TOO.'  The children are 
constandy reading Shakespeare. 
Liebknecht  has at  last achieved something,  to wit, a  litde 
Liebknecht. 
By 'His  Majesty's supreme  and  special command'  my  wife  has 
received  a passport from Berlin.  In May she  will travel  to Trier 
with the  whole  FAMILY  for 3-4  months. 
Salut. Regards  to Lupus.

ENGELS TO MARX 1 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 14 April 1856 
DEAR  Marx, 
I eagerly look forward to the BLUE BOOK.3 But since I shall not 
have time for the process of chronological comparison to which 
you suhjected it, you might give me a few hints some time as to 
the main snags; I shall have to confine myself solely to the MILITARY 
side,  which I shall go through carefully, comparing it with 
Sandwith's bookb  when possible. Up here we've heard absolutely 
nothing about Jones' coup d'état 43 and the consequent pother; I 
must certainly start getting The People's Paper again. 
Never before has the speculation shown such sparkling form in 
Germany. Mevissen is king of the Rhine Province, has bought the 
Indépendance jointly with Morny, and is setting up an international 
(HURRAH!) bank in Luxembourg (!). I have seen the jeremiad in the 
Preussische Correspondent. However, steps have been taken to 
ensure that neither Manteuffel nor von der Heydt suppresses the 
swindle; Crédits mobiliers 45 are being set up in Hanover, Leipzig 
et al. and what these fail to accomplish is sure to be made good by 
unofficial crookery. The final phase of the gamble is now 
beginning: Russia is importing capital and speculation and, given 
these distances, these hundreds of miles of railways, the gamble 
may well develop in such a way as to come to an early and sticky 
end. Once we hear of THE GRAND IRKUTSK TRUNK LINE WITH  BRANCHES  TO 
PEKIN, etc., etc., that will be the moment for us to pack up. This 
time the CRASH will be quite unprecedented; all the ingredients are 
there: intensity, universal scope, and the involvement of all 
propertied and ruling social elements. What I find funniest is your 
worthy Englishman's unshakable conviction, that, in view of the 
'sound' state of TRADE, nothing like that could possibly happen 
here.  It is clear enough that no one is speculating heavily in 
industrial production, it being common knowledge that a modest 
amount of investment in direct production could bring about 
saturation in all markets within a year, and this particularly so 
long as the colossal calls on capital for communications persist. But

of Kars - b H. Sandwith, A Narrative of the Siege of Kars....

as a result of speculation in communications, even industrial 
production is increasing out of all proportion, though more slowly 
than e.g. in 1833-36 or 1842-45. This year cotton prices are rising 
rapidly despite a hitherto unprecedented crop of 3,500,000 bales, 
which looks no larger this year than e.g. 2V2 million bales would 
have looked in 1850. Moreover, relative to England, the Continent 
is taking almost 3 times as much as 5 years ago, as is proved by the 
following table of exports from America between 1 September and 
1 April each year (in thousands of bales): 
Export to England 
over 7 months 
to France 
over 7 months 
to other European ports 
over 7 months 1856 1855 1854 1853 
1,131 963 840 1,100 
354 249 229 255 
346 167 179 204a 
45 1 
So the Continent which, in 1853, took  ——  = —- of the English 
70 5 
figure, took = — in 1856. And to this must be added what was 
0 113 8 
obtained by the Continent from England. As you can see, the 
growth of the industry on the Continent is out of all proportion to 
that in England, and the worthy British,  BEING  RATHER  ON THE DECLINE, 
have every reason not to OVERTRADE in their cotton industry; 1853 
and 1856, however, provide the best comparison, since in both 
years the crop was a very large one—3,300,000 and 3,500,000 
bales.  The substantial exports to France are purely fictitious, for a 
portion goes from Le Havre to Switzerland, Baden, Frankfurt and 
Antwerp. But it is in this enormous leap forward of industry on 
the Continent that the most viable embryo of English revolution 
lies. 
While I see the rag Protection for Trade from time to time, I 
didn't, alas, have a chance to admire amicumb Sebastian0 therein. 
The Pieperiad is becoming distinctly distasteful. This little tale 
has some very amusing aspects, but also some nasty twists, and the 
thread of vanity running through it creates a disagreeable 
impression. Only let the fellow out of your sight for the space of 2 
minutes and he'll go and do something idiotic on the assumption, 
shared by no one else, that he's a genius. I hope that he'll have to

Dear Steffen, 
Can you recommend a good map of Germany suitable for

better still,  1:80,000, 1:60,000,  etc. In addition a map, in rather

more detail (1:60,000 to  1:40,000  would, of course, do), of the 
Rhine Province and Westphalia—a good one, however, and not 
too dear; the Prussian General Staff maps are, I believe, fearfully 
expensive and as yet incomplete. Even 1:150-200,000 might do for 
the map of Germany, that is not so important as that it should be 
good and really suitable. Provided it enables one to distinguish the 
general features of a battlefield, e.g. at Jena or Austerlitz, 46 even 
without an auxiliary plan, I shall be satisfied. The one for the 
Rhine Province and Westphalia should, of course, show what is 
shown on the 1 inch to the mile (about  1:60,000)  English ORDNANCE 
MAP. 
Little that's new up here. Lupus has a great deal to do at the

meeting in honour of the French Revolution. The good fellow 
was, of course, hoping to see a repetition of the row caused by his 
'lettre à la reine'. 1 Was disappointed, however. From this you will 
also gather how subordinate is the attitude adopted by the French 
would-be revolutionaries here vis-à-vis 'Marianne'. 5. 2 cuttings 
from The People's Paper, my first 2 articles on the Kars PAPERS." Shall 
also send you third and final instalments. Since the original of 
Article I had gone astray, and time, not to mention Ernest Jones, 
was pressing, I had to do a hasty rehash of the Tribune article out 
of my head, so that sundry bits of nonsense have crept in which 
will certainly not elude your keen nose. BUT NEVER MIND THAT! I 
mention it simply to let you know why-1 didn't send you the thing 
straight away. 
The day before yesterday a little banquet took place to celebrate 
the anniversary of The People's Paper. On this occasion, the times 
seeming to require it, I accepted the invitation, the more so since 
(AS ANNOUNCED IN THE PAPER) I alone of the whole emigration was 
invited, and the first toast also fell to me, i.e. I was asked to 
propose one to the souveraineté du prolétariat dans tous les  pays. b So I 
made a short  SPEECH  in English, which, however, I shall not allow to 
appear in print. 48 The end I sought has been achieved. Mr 
Talandier—who had to pay 2/6d for his  TICKET—is  now convinced, 
like the rest of the French and other émigré crews, that we are the 
Chartists' only 'intimate' allies and that, though we may hold aloof 
from public demonstrations and leave it to the FRENCHMEN to flirt 
openly with Chartism, it is always in our power to resume the 
position already allotted to us by history. This had become all the 
more necessary because, at the above-mentioned meeting of 25 
February presided over by Pyat, the German lout Scherzer 
(OLD  BOY)  spoke and, in truly dreadful Straubingerian style, 49 
denounced the German 'scholars', the 'intellectual workers', for 
having left them (the louts) in the lurch, thus forcing them 
to make fools of themselves in the eyes of the other nationalities. 
You will remember Scherzer from Paris days. I have met friend 
Schapper again several times and have found him very much the 
repentant sinner. The retirement in which he has been living for 
the past 2 years would seem  RATHER  to have sharpened his wits than 
otherwise. As you will realise, there are all sorts of contingencies in 
a The first two articles from Marx's series The Fall of Kars published in The  People's 
Paper  on 5 and 12 April 1856 and based on Marx's article of the same title for the 
New-York  Daily Tribune mentioned further in the text. - b the sovereignty of the 
proletariat  in all countries (see K. Marx, 'Speech at the Anniversary of The  People's 
Paper.  Delivered in London, April 14,  1856').

which it might be advantageous to have the man to hand  AND,  STILL 
MORE, to have him out of the hands of Willich. Schapper is now 
furiously angry with the Windmill 50 louts. 
I shall forward your letter to Steffen. You ought to have kept 
Levy's letter" there. Do so in general witfi all letters I don't ask 
you to return. The less they go through the post THE  BETTER.  I fully 
agree with you about the Rhine Province. As for us, the worst of it 
is that, LOOMING IN THE FUTURE, I see something that looks like 'high 
treason'. Whether we are forced into the same kind of position as 
the Mainz Clubbists 51 in the old revolution will largely depend on 
the tournure* things take in Berlin. Ça sera dur. c We, who are so 
ENLIGHTENED about OUT good frères from across the Rhine! THE 
WHOLE  THING IN GERMANY will depend on whether it is possible  TO BACK 
THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION BY SOME SECOND EDITION OF THE PEASANTS - WAR. In 
which case the affair should go swimmingly. 
I have heard nothing whatever about Stieber II. Write and tell 
me what you know on this score. 
Now for the chronique scandaleuse? 
The Pieper comedy came to an end as abrupt as it was bitter. 
On the one hand, he got a letter in which the old GREENGROCER 
turned him down out of hand and forbade him the house. On the 
other, the green-bespectacled screech-owl—an indescribably hide­
ous piece of baggage—turned up at our house in search of 'her' 
Pieper. She proposed that they should elope together. With great 
tact he refused quite unequivocally. So the comedy is over. It is to 
be hoped that this bitter experience, the result of his irresistible-
ness,  will have some salutory effect upon Prince Charming. 
Enclosed a letter from Seiler. As soon as this Falstaff arrived in 
New York he caught Edgar e just as the latter was about to set out 
for Texas. Edgar has in the meantime come into some money 
from the inheritance. The nasty consequences of this meeting with 
Seiler will be apparent to you from the letter. 
A fine pair, Seiler and Conrad Schramm!

however, you know how a man feels when he's kept on the hop by 
piles.  And such a man am I. 
I am glad to hear that you and Lupus are entirely of my 
opinion with regard to Miquel's letter52—the attempt to digest this 
'wisdom' fairly 'turned my stomach'. 
Unless something goes wrong with the pecuniary arrangements 
I have made, my family will be leaving in 10 to 14 days at the

Cologne people are aware that the Düsseldorfers have completely 
broken with Lassalle who has fallen into general disrepute among 
them. 
Yesterday the following comical missive arrived from Sheffield: 
»Council Hall, Sheffield,

expression of their warm thanks for the great public service you have rendered by 
your admirable exposé of the Kars Papers published in 77»« People's PaperA I have

That is magnanimous, there being war to the death between The 
People's Paper and The Free Press, as between Chartism and 
Urquhartism generally.42 The great Ironside went one step further 
and decreed  THAT THE THANKS OF THE COUNTRV WERE DUE TO DR. M.e ETC. It 
would have been much better had the chaps sent me the money 
they made out by reprinting the Palmerston articles under the title

Dear Engels, 
The family went off yesterday.b I have been incapable of work 
this week, partly because of the TROUBLE in the house, partly 
because of a rheumaticky back such as I have never experienced 
before. 
Herewith Bazancourt^the 'Napoleonic' account of the Crimean 
business.0 Might not something be made of it for Putnam's}60 It's 
urgent that I obtain the services of this firm since the money and 
gear needed for the journey have compelled me to accept through 
Zitschke a sole bill for £30 on  myself,  payable in 3 months' time. A 
man from Putnam's has been to see Freiligrath, and they are 
willing to take articles. 
I have only read the excerpts from Bazancourt that were 
published in the French papers. To judge by them, it would 
appear to provide much amusing matter. The thing cannot, I 
a We shall see. - b See this volume, p. 33. - c  Bazancourt, L'expédition  de Crimée jvsqu'

think, be treated other than flippantly. If done, it should not be 
made too short, but solely with the idea of filling up space. 
Trübner, who looked like accepting my Swedish stuff two 
months ago but then gave no further sign of life, wrote yesterday 
and arranged an entrevue 3 on Tuesday to discuss the matter. That 
would provide 20 sheets of work. 61 
I am in a  SERIOUS  DILEMMA  as to whether or not I should now go on 
a TRIP. On the one hand I've got to slog away at making money. 
On the other the doctorb  has told me—and I believe he's 
right—that I should travel a bit and have a change of air, as my 
liver is again functioning irregularly. I AM NOT YET DECIDED what I 
should do. It's not as though staying here were especially 
economical, since I also have Pieper round my neck. But the main 
thing is my work. 
As TO Bazancourt, let me know whether you need the first part as 
well. If nothing can be made of the thing it would be better not to 
buy it. 
I am incapable of writing today, but must nevertheless ask you 
to clear up a philological doubt. In Henry IV, Shakespeare used 
the word 'hiren' for 'siren' and, according to a note made by that 
pedant, Johnson/ the form 'hiren' also occurs in other early 
English writers.d  The substitution of h for s is QUITE  in order, but 
might there not be some connection between 'hiren' and 'Hure', e 
and hence also 'siren'? Or with 'hoeren', auris,1 etc.? You can see 
TO WHICH  LOW  STATE  OF SPIRIT  I am  DEPRESSED  today from the great interest 
I show in this matter. 
I have received some very curious information about Ruge's 
tragedy, the Neue Welt, in which 'the tragedy of love turns into a 
farce'. Shall tell you about it in my next. 
Herzen is going to Switzerland. I await your COMMUNICATIONS on 
Ireland.

ENGELS TO MARX 62 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 23 May 1856 
Dear Marx, 
During our trip to IrelandM  we travelled from Dublin to Galway 
on the West Coast, then 20 miles north and inland, on to 
Limerick, down the Shannon to Tarbert, Tralee and Killarney, 
and back to Dublin. In all approx. 450-500 English miles within 
the country  itself,  so we have seen approx. /s of the entire 
country. With the exception of Dublin, which is to London what 
Düsseldorf is to Berlin, bears altogether the stamp of having been 
a small royal seat and is, moreover, built entirely in the English 
style,  the whole country and particularly the towns give one the 
impression of being in France or Northern Italy. Gendarmes, 
priests, lawyers, bureaucrats, lords of the manor in cheerful 
profusion and a total absence of any and every industry, so that 
one could barely conceive what all these parasitic plants live on, 
were there no counterpart in the wretchedness of the peasants. 
The 'iron hand' is visible in every nook and cranny; the 
government meddles in everything, not a trace of so-called 
SELF-GOVERNMENT.  Ireland may be regarded as the earliest English 
colony and one which, by reason of her proximity, is still governed 
in exacdy the same old way; here one cannot fail to notice that the 
English citizen's so-called freedom is based on the oppression of 
the colonies. In no other country have I seen so many gendarmes, 
and it is in the CONSTABULARY, which is armed with carbine, bayonet 
and handcuffs, that the bibulous expression of your Prussian 
gendarme reaches its ultimate state of perfection. 
Peculiar to the country are its ruins, the oldest 5th and 6th 
century, the most recent 19th, and every stage in between. The 
earliest, all churches; from 1100, churches and casdes; from 1800, 
farmhouses. Throughout die west, but particularly the Galway 
region, the countryside is strewn with these derelict farmhouses, 
most of which have only been abandoned since 1846. I had never 
imagined that famine could be so tangibly real.64 Whole villages 
are deserted; in between the splendid parks of the smaller 
LANDLORDS, virtually the only people still living there, lawyers mosdy. 

=====第84页=====
50 17. Engels to Marx. 23 May 1856 
Famine, emigration and CLEARANCES65 between them have brought 
this about. The fields are empty even of cattle; the countryside is a 
complete wilderness unwanted by anybody. In County Clare, south 
of Galway, things improve a bit, for there's some cattle at least 
and, towards Limerick, the hills are excellently cultivated, mostly 
by Scottish FARMERS, the ruins have been cleared away, and the 
country has a domesticated air. In the south-west, numerous 
mountains and bogs but also marvellously luxuriant woodland; 
further on, fine pastures again, especially in Tipperary and, 
approaching Dublin, increasing signs that the land is occupied by 
big farmers. 
The English wars of conquest from 1100a  to 1850 (au fond b they 
lasted as long as this, as did also martial law) utterly ruined the 
country. With regard to most of the ruins, it has been established 
that the destruction took place during these wars. Thus the very 
people have acquired their unusual character and, for all their 
fanatical Irish nationalism, the fellows no longer feel at home in 
their own country. IRELAND FOR THE SAXON! That is now becoming a 
reality. The Irishman knows that he cannot compete with the 
Englishman, who comes armed with resources in every respect 
superior to his own; emigration will continue until the predomi­
nantly, indeed almost exclusively, Celtic nature of the population 
has gone to pot. How often have the Irish set out to achieve 
something and each time been crushed, politically and industrially! 
In this artificial manner, through systematic oppression, they have 
come to be a completely wretched nation and now, as everyone 
knows, they have the job of providing England, America, 
Australia, etc., with whores, day labourers, maquereaux? pickpock­
ets, swindlers, beggars and other wretches. Even the aristocracy 
are infected by this wretchedness. The landowners, wholly 
bourgeoisified everywhere else, are here completely down-at-heel. 
Their country seats are surrounded by huge and lovely parks but 
all around there is desolation and where the money is supposed to 
come from heaven only knows. These fellows are too funny for 
words: of mixed blood, for the most part tall, strong, handsome 
types,  all with enormous moustaches under a vast Roman nose, 
they give themselves the bogus martial airs of a colonel en retraite, 6 
travel the country in search of every imaginable diversion and, on 
inquiry, prove to be as poor as church mice, up to their eyes

Dear Marx, 
Herewith the article,11 but you should read it over first. Today 
the office again prevented me from doing so  myself. 
Bazancourta will be of some use—Bonaparte's Bat-
rachomyomachia.67 But Vol. I absolutely essential. I shall send you 
6/- worth of stamps for it tomorrow, or rather, they are enclosed 
herewith. 
I would advise you to pack your bags at once, taking such 
papers as are absolutely necessary. Then you can work here as 
well as in Scotland, at least on certain subjects. We could do 
Bazancourt ±b together.60 Admittedly, you would have to do most 
of the work for, with business expanding rapidly, commerce is 
making such demands on me that there can be no thought of 
regular and sustained work. If you finished this thing here (1 
article would of course suffice), you could always either do 
parliamentary articles here, or else take a trip to Scotland and get 
down to some hard work here on your return. Until the 
Pan-Slavism is finished I should be reluctant to saddle myself with

Dear Frederic, 
I leave for Scodand at the end of this week, and shall come on 
to you from there after an interval of 6 days, but will of course 
give you prior notice. Should you write to me during this week, 
address the letters 'C. Marx,  CARE  OF P. Imandt, 29 Cowgate, 
Dundee'. There was a twofold reason for my decision to come to 
you via Scodand: 
1. Medical, because I know that the sea-voyage will put me to 
rights and it was only the day before yesterday that I got rid of my 
rheumatism. Moreover, there have been other unpleasantnesses, 
including excessive bleeding at stool. I have, of course, also 
consulted  my  SURGEON. 
2. Pieper. He will accompany me to Scotland and then return to 
London. Had I not agreed to this arrangement, the lad—he 
obtained the money for the trip from his former pupil, 
A. Rothschild—was fully determined to make his way to Paris on 
a false passport, allegedly with the intention of proceeding from 
there to Geneva on foot. You will realise what a strange and 
compromising end SUCH AN EXPEDITION LIKELY  WAS  TO ARRIVÉ AT.

My darling Sweetheart, 
I am writing to you again because I am alone and because it is 
irksome to converse with you all the time in my head without you 
knowing or hearing or being able to answer me. Bad as your 
portrait is, it serves its end well enough, and I now understand 
how it is that even the least flattering portraits of the mother of 
God, the 'Black Madonnas',70 could have their inveterate admir­
ers—  more admirers, indeed, than the good portraits. At any rate, 
none of these 'Black Madonna' portraits has ever been so much 
kissed and ogled and adored as your photograph which, while 
admittedly not black, has a crabbed expression and in no way 
reflects your dear, lovely, kissable,  dolce*  countenance. But I put

right what the sun's rays have wrongly depicted, discovering that 
my eyes, spoiled though they are by lamplight and tobacco smoke, 
can nevertheless paint not only in the dreaming but also in the 
waking state. There you are before me, large as life, and I lift you 
up in my arms and I kiss you all over from top to toe, and I fall 
on my knees before you and cry: 'Madame, I love you.'a And love 
you I do, with a love greater than was ever felt by the Moor of 
Venice.b Falsely and foully doth the false and foul world all 
characters construe. Who of my many calumniators and venom-
ous-tongued enemies has ever reproached me with being called 
upon to play the romantic lead in a second-rate theatre? And yet it 
is true. Had the scoundrels possessed the wit, they would have 
depicted 'the productive and social relations' on one side and, on 
the other, myself at your feet. Beneath it they would have written: 
LOOK TO THIS PICTURE  AND  TO THAT.C But stupid the scoundrels are and 
stupid they will remain, in seculum seculorum.d 
Temporary absence is good, for in a person's presence things 
look too much alike for them to be distinguished. At close quarters 
even towers appear dwarfed, whereas what is petty and common­
place, seen close at hand, assumes undue proportions. So, too, with 
the passions. Little habits which, by their very proximity, obtrude 
upon one, and thus assume the form of passions, vanish as soon as 
their immediate object is out of sight. Great passions which, by the 
proximity of their object, take on the form of little habits, wax 
large and resume their natural proportions under the magical 
effect of distance. So it is with my love. Mere spatial separation 
from you suffices to make me instantly aware that time has done 
for my love just what the sun and the rain do for plants—made it 
grow. My love for you, as soon as you are away from me, appears 
for what it is, a giant, and into it all the vigour of my mind and all 
the ardour of my heart are compressed. I feel myself once more a 
man because I feel intense passion, and the multifariousness in 
which we are involved by study and modern education, no less 
than the scepticism which inevitably leads us to cavil at every 
subjective and objective impression, is calculated to render each 
one of us petty and weak and fretful and vacillating. But love, not 
for Feuerbachian Man, not for Moleschottian metabolism, not for 
the proletariat, but love for a sweetheart and notably for  yourself, 
turns a man back into a man again.

You will smile, my dear heart, and wonder 'why diis rhetoric all 
of a sudden?' But if I could press your sweet white bosom to mine, 
I would be silent and say not a word. Since I cannot kiss with my 
lips I must kiss with my tongue and frame words. I could, indeed, 
even frame verse, German Books of Sorrow after the manner of 
Ovid's Libri Tristium. He, however, had merely been banished by 
the Emperor Augustus; I have been banished from you,a and that 
is something Ovid could not understand. 
There are, indeed, many women in the world, and a few of 
them are beautiful. But where else shall I find a face of which 
every lineament, every line even, reawakens the greatest and 
sweetest memories of my life? In your sweet countenance I can 
read even my infinite sorrows, my irreplaceable losses,b and when 
I kiss your sweet face I kiss away my sorrow. 'Buried in her arms, 
revived by her kisses'—in your arms, that is, and by your 
kisses—and let the Brahmins and Pythagoras keep their doctrine 
of re-birth, and Christianity its doctrine of resurrection. 
To conclude with  SOME  FACTS.  I have today sent Isaac Ironside the 
FIRST  PAPER OF THE SERIES 6I and have, in addition, made notes (i.e. on 
the text of the despatches) in my own hand and in my own 
English.c I must say I felt a bit anxious when Frederic,d  with that 
litde quizzical look he has, calmly read through the stuff before it 
was sent off. Mats pour la première fois 1 * he was quite astonished 
and exclaimed that this important work ought to be published in 
another form and, above all things, to be published in German.* I 
shall send the first issue to you and to old Schlosser, the historian, 
in Germany. 
Apropos. I see from the Augsburger* which refers direcdy to our 
circular letters'1 discussed at the communist trial in Cologne,71  that 
another circular letter, 'reputedly' from the same source, has been 
sent out from London. It is a forgery, a miserable gallimaufry of 
our things, put together by Mr Stieber who, not having been 
accorded due honour in Prussia of late, now seeks to set himself 
up as a great man in Hanover. Engels and I intend to publish a

I have duly considered your proposal, and, on the whole, accede

the reservations to make as to 'copy  used'.

amply supplied every week to that extent. 
It would be most convenient to me (if your arrangements admit 
of it) to receive a remittance say after every fresh weekly

As to your reprinting the papers in your serials, I have no

materials, later on, in any way I may see it fit to use them.

publication. 
In thanking you for the serials you were so kind to send me, I 
cannot but regret that you did not think fit to communicate to me 
the proof-sheets of the 'Story of the life of Lord Palmerston'.58 
Sentences, historical data, quotations from Palmerston's 
speeches—everything is so disfigured by errata that, in my 
opinion, the pamphlet, in its present form, is not only useless but 
positively mischievous. 
A few words on the plan of the whole publicationa will suffice. I 
do not adopt the usual manner of opening the whole theme by 
general considerations, but on the contrary commence with facts. 
In contradistinction to the usual manner of historical writers, I 
shall not commence this publication with general considerations, 
but with facts. The first chapter will be composed of despatches 
belonging to different epochs of that century, in order to show up 
the Russian spirit of English diplomacy during the 18th.c

Dear Frederic, 
A letter from my wife received today via Manchester brings 
news of her mother'sc death on July 23. This will hasten her

At the same time a letter from Miquel, who is thinking of 
coming over here in a week or 10 days' time. Highly inconvenient

As regards Sheffield, the matter stands as follows: 
In the last issue the fellows made some disgraceful cuts, 
whereupon Pieper wrote to Cyples: * 'I am directed by Dr Marx to 
inform you that he cannot congratulate you upon the emenda­
tions,  etc'  * 7 
Then the following letter arrived from Ironside3: 
* Free Press Office, Sheffield, 
July 19, 1856 
Dear Doctor, 
It could not be satisfactory either to us or to yourself to close your article in the 
abrupt way which you on the instant proposed. I am sorry that I was so 
unsuccessful in cutting down last week's contributions, and should have hesitated in 
doing so had it not unfortunately happened that there was really no other 
alternative. As to Mr Ironside's note, permit me to say that in another letter since 
received from him, he expresses regret that you should have construed his scrap as 
he did not intend it, and intimates a doubt that J have in some way offended you? 
I see no reason why our professional intercourse may not continue and be 
pleasant; and I venture to hope to receive the usual packet of copy for next week's 
issue. You will be so good as to excuse my tardiness in writing. I have been so busy.

Dear E., 
The £5 note most gratefully received but not as yet the letter 
you promised me. Herewith a letter from the crazy Mirbach, 
which I have received—via Berlin! 
No money from Sheffield yet. Today I got Pieper to send a 
dunning letter. Meanwhile there has been the following incident: 
Yesterday Urquhart's  bulldog—THE  CELEBRATED  Collet—appeared at 
my house. He had come, he said, at the behest of the Grand Coph-
ta79 himself.  Urquhart was *very sorry, regretted, indeed, very 
a black care

much that Mr Ironside had interfered at all with my articles etc., 
which he thought of extraordinary value etc.* Then he asked me to 
tell him how the matter had come about. * Mr Urquhart imagined 
that the principal cause of the quarrel was the suppression of 
some parts of the copy etc.* I then told him what had happened75 
and showed him the written corpora delicti? Next, he asked me 
* whether I was willing to enter upon any compromise, which 
question I flatly denied, telling him that I was no penny-a-liner 
and not to be treated like the London literary vagabonds.* It 
seemed he was only awaiting this statement in order to tell me 
with EXTRAORDINARY SOLEMNITY that Urquhart thought The Free Press 
'inadequate'. * Mr Ironside was placed on the horns of a dilemma 
because The Free Press was, indeed, but an extract from the 
Sheffield Free Press—a paper, by the bye, twice the dimensions of 
the F.  P.—  and what was suited to the wants of the readers of the 
Sh. F. P. was not all palatable to the readers of the F. P. and vice 
versa. Mr Urquhart had, therefore, resolved upon starting in 
about a month a diplomatic journal at London.* He hoped that I 
would let him have the whole of the Revelations80  and not bear 
him a GRUDGE. I returned a vague answer capable of being 
construed in the affirmative but leaving me free—if the conditions 
should prove too poor or the paper too crazy—to refuse. It 
will all depend on the nature of the paper. In London things are 
rather different from Sheffield, and, should Urquhart come out 
with his counter-revolutionary nonsense in such a way that 
collaboration with him would discredit me in the eyes of the 
revolutionaries here, I would be obliged, *of course, hard as it 
would be under the present miserable circumstances,* to decide 
against it. However, nous verrons}' At all events I have now received 
adequate satisfaction as regards my LITERARY POINT OF HONOUR, in as 
much as the chief has all but disowned his LIEUTENANT. This is a 
satisfactory dénouement, if only on account of Bûcher and the 
democratic  riff-raff. 
There will now be much wrangling within the Urquhartite camp 
itself.  It seemed to me that they evinced a bad TENDENCY to make a 
SCAPEGOAT of poor Cyples. E.g., Collet said he wasn't sure whether it 
was with Ironside's knowledge that Cyples had sent me the 
former's letter. To this I replied that Cyples seemed to be an 
honest fellow who had heard SECRET DIPLOMACY- SO greatly decried 
that he naturally assumed PUBLIC DIPLOMACY- to be the rule at the 
F. P. OFFICE.

Received a letter today from my wife. She seems greatly affected 
by the old lady'sa death. She will have to spend a week or 10 days 
in Trier in order to put up for auction what little in the way of 
effects her mother has left and to share the PROCEEDS with Edgar.b 
She has proposed the following scheme: After spending a few 
days more in the vicinity of Trier with a woman friend of hers, 
she will travel to Paris and thence direct to Jersey, having decided 
that we ought to spend September and October there. First, so 
that she herself can recuperate; secondly, because it's cheaper and 
pleasanter than London and, finally, so that the children should 
learn French, etc. She doesn't, of course, know anything about 
what has been taking place here. For the present I have written to 
say that it's a splendid scheme, although I cannot in fact see how it 
can be put into effect. Yesterday 1 again saw the New-York Tribune 
(WEEKLY). The whole paper is filled with nothing but the ELECTORAL 
DODGE and so it will be for months to come. We cannot hope 
seriously to tackle the N.-Y. T. until the presidential business is 
over.

jeremiad. 0 Watered-down twaddle, every other word a solecism, 
callow botchery, weak-kneed affectation, foppish naive pretension, 
a mess of Griinian Jew's ears in beggar's broth, one long 
platitude—nothing of the kind has ever before appeared in print. 
All that was needed to give the 'German Parliament'44  the final 
kick in the arse was this self-exposure on the part of one of its 
heroes. Needless to say, I did no more than leaf through it. I'd 
sooner swill soap-suds or hobnob with Zoroaster over mulled cow's 
piss than read through all that  stuff.  He and Co. are perpetually 
haunted by our ghost. L. Blanc, Blanqui, Marx and Engels are his 
Unholy Quadrinity which he never forgets. We two—the pro-
pounders of 'equal economic rights'—are said inter alia to have 
advocated 'Armed (!) appropriation of capital'. Even the jokes we 
cracked about Switzerland in the Revue 'fill him with indignation'.

ENGELS TO MARX

Manchester, 4 August 1856 
Dear Marx, 
The letter that didn't arrive must have melted in the heat. I 
don't know whether you down there too have suddenly been 
assailed by this tropical heat which has brought everything to a 
standstill, apart from the continuous sluicing and bathing of the 
outer man with water and the inner man with a variety of other 
fluids.  Yesterday I was totally incapable of anything and barely in 
a condition to go out. I haven't stopped sweating since Thursday, 
even in my bath; and the sordid work at the office is so exhausting 
that afterwards one feels utterly down. Moreover the nights are 
equally stifling. 
It's most satisfactory that the Urquhart business should have 
turned out as it did.3 There's no doubt that what most impresses 
the rabble is our resolute manner. I hope it will be possible for the 
piecesb  to appear in Urquhart's thing, nous verrons. 0 
I'm daily awaiting a letter from my mater summoning me to 
London. I am arranging matters in such a way as to be able to 
leave on Saturday, should the summons come. I shall be moving 
out of here on Saturday though I haven't yet taken new lodgings,

and still don't know whether I shall do so or spend a week 
knocking about, since I intend on my return to engage in all kinds 
of mad escapades. 
My brother-in-law" has been here—a good chap, communist out 
of principle, bourgeois out of interest, as he himself most naively 
puts it, but he always uses 'we' when referring to communist 
matters; tried to talk me into making tentative approaches to the 
Prussians about an amnesty, whereupon I, of course, gave a very 
determined answer and finally he, too, saw that 1. I couldn't do 
so, and 2. that the Prussians would tell me to shove it, etc.—The 
man seemed to have few illusions about my frame of mind and 
certainly had even fewer when he left. However, he was very 
surprised to find me so cheerful. 
I shall write to Mirbach as soon as it gets a little cooler; it's too 
much to expect just now. 24 degrees Reaumur is no joke when 
one has to traipse round in clothes proper to the Exchange. 
If the Jersey scheme can be carried out—it certainly has its 
good points and is not entirely impossible—make sure that while 
in Paris, your wife finds out exactly how things stand regarding 
route and communications, for otherwise she might get into 
serious difficulties. I believe that Saint-Malo is the only place in 
France to which steamers go from Jersey. Get one or two of the 
crapauds^ to tell you what the position is. After all, you know 
several who have been there. 
You can give the great Pieper my assurance that I read his great 
'filtered' article on Spain in The People's Paper b before the original 
appeared in the Tribune?  HANG  ITT C'est  beau. d By the way, the P. P.

they'll have to shell out in any case. Y

in the old hole. At last we found a place—a whole house which we 
have to FURNISH ourselves. It is 9 Grafton Terrace, Maitiand Park, 
Haverstock Hill, Hampstead Road. Rent £36. We are to move in 
on 29 September; this week we have to furnish it. We are in 
something of a quandary, as we have ABOUT £26 to pay out in 
town, and a great deal more for the new set-up. I.e. we are short 
of £10-£15—if only for the time being, since there is still a 
sizeable sum due to my wife from her brother 2 in Berlin as a 
result of the Trier legacy.84  Yesterday he wrote to say that he 
couldn't send the money because the Lower Silesian Railway 
Bonds in which the capital due to my wife is invested could be 
sold dans ce moment h only at a considerable loss. As M. le Ministre 
sadly remarks: 
'It is, to be sure, an unfavourable moment just now, since all genuine securities 
such as these have fallen sharply as a result of frenzied speculation in Crédit 
mobilier' 15 and limited liability companies.' 
If you can supply part of what is wanted, I think I can manage 
the remainder with the help of the pawnshop until the money 
arrives from Berlin. The worst of it is that there's no time to be 
lost. 
I was terribly affected by the news of Weerth's death,85 which I 
found hard to believe. Freiligrath, too, has already written to me 
about an obituary. But I must confess that I can't think of a likely 
paper in Germany. The only possibility might be an obituary in 
the Tribune until the times permit us to do something bigger and 
better. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION? 
Today I have been invited to dine with the Putnam's chapc who 
is over here again. I don't know whether I shall go. My poor 
spoken English might put me to shame. 
The Tribune has returned me the unpublished articles. These 
are,  ALL IN ALL, Pan-Slavismn and my articles on the DANUBIAN 
PRINCIPALITIES.3  Mr Dana says in his letter that, if I cannot place the 
things elsewhere, they will be legally responsible for any 'LOSS' 
incurred, since they failed to register their objections soon 
enough. In the opposite case, they expect to get PART of their 
EXPENSES  back. Nous verrons. 0

Pieper, whom I threw out on my wife's return, found his way 
back and settled in again 2 days later which, just now, is far from 
pleasant. When I move into our new home, I shall leave him 
behind, safely installed on my surety in the little hole you know in 
Dean Street. 
A Prussian amnesty is expected on 15 October. Otto's mother 
died leaving 2,000 talers; these were confiscated by the Prussian 
government to pay the 'costs of the Cologne trial'. l 
Strohn was here last Friday. The fellow has put on an enormous 
amount of weight, in consequence of which his spirits seem to 
have improved SOMEWHAT at the expense of his wits. Nor is his 
expression now so wry—benevolent, RATHER. 
I have heard all sorts of details concerning Heine, recounted to 
my wife in Paris by Reinhardt. Shall write about these at length 
some other time. For the present only that 
'Eight had barely struck, yet she 
Was quaffing wine with laughter free'3 
came true LITERALLY in his case. While his corpse was still in the 
mortuary—on the day of the funeral—the maquereauh  of Mathilde 
the mild, angelic child, did in fact appear on the doorstep and 
fetch her away. The worthy 'Meissner', who doled out such sloppy 
rubbish about Heine to the German public, c was paid in cash by 
'Mathilde' to sing the praises of this trollop who had tormented 
POOR Heine to death. 
But now for another story about Moses Hess. That lad's fame 
WAS DUE TO A GREAT PART—TO Sazonov. When Hess and the Moses 
womand  arrived in Paris, this Russian was in very sore straits, very 
down at heel, without money or credit and consequently very 
plebeian and revolutionary and receptive to ideas of world 
subversion. Sazonov heard that Moses was not without 'ducats'. He 
therefore took his stand behind Moses and in front of the Moses 
woman. The latter he bedded, the former he extolled  AS A GREAT 
LITERARY LUMEN, putting him in touch with the editorial boards of 
reviews and newspapers. Vladimire  OF COURSE,  had a finger in every 
pie and a foot in every door. Thus he extracted enough ducats 
from the tight-fisted Moses to enable him to 'shine' again and to 
put out decoys for further credit. And with these Sazonov enticed 
a rich old Jewess with whom he entered into kosher WEDLOCK. From 
then on, however, he became a man of fashion again and turned

MARX  TO ENGELS 20 
IN MANCHESTER 
London,  26 September  1856 
28 Dean Street, Soho 
Dear Frederick, 
FIRST,  I must  ACKNOWLEDGE  with  THANKS RECEIPT  of the money. I 
would have done  so  yesterday  had we not  been  in a  veritable 
HURLY-BURLY  with  our  removal.  It  remains doubtful, moreover, 
whether  we  shall  be out of  here before Monday since, even with 
your money  and  what  the  pawnshop  has  yielded,  we  still haven't 
QUITE  got the  requisite amount.  The  present crisis  on the  European 
stock exchanges  has  come  at an  awkward time  for us  personally. 
No news apart from what  you may  already know, namely that 
Stirner  has  died.  A  letter  has  also reached London,  or so 
a The  Grandeur  and  Decline  of the  House  of Moses  (an  ironical allusion  to Balzac's 
L'Histoire  de la grandeur  et de la  décadence  de Cézar Birotteau).-  b For  want  of means

Freiligrath tells me, from his 'ex-sweetheart' a in Australia, in which 
she says that she has married again but has at the same time 
turned religious and, by harping on the 'better life to come', has 
contrived to drive her novum hominemb into the 'madhouse'. This 
last is meant verbatim. 
Well, I went to souper with the Putnam's man. c Besides  myself, 
the only people present were Freiligrath and an old Yankee. The 
Putnam's man was a quiet, genial soul, the other Yankee a jaunty, 
witty chap. Putnam wants us if possible, after the Bazancourt,60 to 
revert to the 'SHIPS AGAINST WALLS' question, as being of special 
interest to Americans in connection with the recent war.'1 Then 
again, something on floating batteries and gunboats; light or heavy 
guns,  etc. All this seems to be with an eye to an American war, at 
a closer or more distant time, against England. Besides these 
militaribus I am then to write on Heine. In short, we can now 
engage in REGULAR INTERCOURSE with this very 'good' house. 
Considering the rent, the house I have taken is very nice and 
could hardly have been let so cheaply were not the immediate 
neighbourhood, roads, etc.,  SOMEWHAT  UNFINISHED.  When you come up 
to London you'll find a complete HOME. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE ASPECT OF THE MONEY MARKET? There is no 
doubt that the increases in the discount rate on the Continent are 
partly associated with the appreciation of silver against gold due to 
the Californian and Australian gold (the Belgian Bank is now 
giving only 19 frs. 40 c.—silver—for one napoléon d'or") and hence 
bullion dealers everywhere where gold and silver are the legal 
STANDARD are withdrawing the latter from the banks. But whatever 
the reason for the increases in the discount rate, these are at least 
precipitating the DOWNFALL of the vast speculative transactions and, 
more specifically, of the GRAND PAWNINGSHOP AT PARIS.' I don't believe 
that the great monetary crisis will outlast the winter of 1857. 
Those stupid asses, the BRITISHERS, imagine that this time all is SOUND 
over here, as opposed to the Continent. Apart from the intimate 
connection between the OLD LADY OF THREADNEEDLE STREET and the 
Paris concern, 87 the asses overlook the fact that a large part of 
English capital is tied up in continental credits and that their SOUND' 
OVERTRADING (exports this year are expected to reach £110 million) 
is based on the Continent's UNSOUND' SPECULATION, just as their 
civilisational propaganda of 1854-56 was on the coup d'état of 
a Marie Wilhelmine Dähnhardt - *> new man - c Frederick Olmsted - ä  the Crimean 
war, 1853-56 - e napoléon d'or —a twenty-franc gold coin issued by Napoleon 
I - f probably the Bank of France

1851.  This time, however,  as opposed  to earlier crises, France  has 
discovered  the  form  in which speculation could  be and has  been 
propagated throughout  the  whole  of Europe.  In contrast  to the 
Gallic raffinement  of St.  Simonism, 88 STOCKJOBBERY  and  imperialism, 
your English speculator  at home appears  to have reverted  to the 
primitive form  of simple  and  UNMITIGATED  FRAUD.  Witness Strahan, 
Paul and  Bates,  the  TIPPERARY BANK  OF SADLEIR  MEMORY,  the  GREAT CITY 
FRAUDS  OF Davidson, Cole  and  Co., now  the  ROYAL BRITISH BANK  and, 
finally,  the  Crystal Palace affair89  (4,000 bogus shares  put  into 
circulation).  The  BRITISHERS abroad speculate under continental 
COLOURS, those  at home revert  to fraude simple,  and  that's what  the 
chaps call  a SOUND STATE OF COMMERCE'. 90 
This time,  by the by, the  thing  has  assumed European 
dimensions such  as have never been seen before,  and I  don't 
suppose we'll  be  able  to spend much longer here merely  as 
spectators.  The  very fact that  I've at  last got  round  to setting  up 
house again  and  sending  for my  books9 seems  to me to  prove 
that the  'mobilisation'  of our  persons  is AT HAND.

arrival, did he come out with it. You can imagine how staggered 
and annoyed I was at this idiotic conduct. For the next 8-14 days I 
hardly had a moment to myself and couldn't even go and see 
Steinthal to find out more, let alone turn my thoughts to an 
obituary or the like. He has probably left some written work and I 
shall make sure I get a sight of it. 
You might send me the Pan-Slavism11 when you have an 
opportunity. As soon as I have the time I shall revise the thing 
and knock it into reasonable shape—for Putnam's (?) or anything 
else that might turn up in the meantime. Now, while the mischief 
is still in progress, I would offer the 'PRINCIPALITIES'3 to an English 
paper or MONTHLY. How are things going on with Urquhart [....]61 
very doubtful about it  [....]  I can see no possibility so far. In any 
case,  we shall not be affected by the amnesty.

10 days or a fortnight. It's not going so quickly after all, you see, I 
had no time to do any preparatory work. If only I had my 
Tribune articles on the war94! Now all the material has to be got 
together again. After this, we can offer them  SHIPS  AGAINST  WALLS  and 
then we should manage to keep the ball rolling all right. 
That gold has depreciated against silver is no longer in any 
doubt. However it is also a fact that silver has vanished, but where 
to, I cannot quite make out. Such is the state of confusion that a 
great deal must have been buried or tucked away in China. Again, 
the BALANCE  OF TRADE  has recently been extremely favourable to India 
and China vis-à-vis England, the Continent and America taken 
together. At all events it must be highly gratifying for John Bull to 
find that he is already worth 6d IN THE POUND less. 
The clouds gathering over the money market are sombre 
indeed, and the Constitutionnel's old HORIZON POLITIQUE- may well 
come into its own again. 95 Last Tuesday's affair at the Bank, when 
1 million in gold was withdrawn, is significant. It almost looks as 
though the storm is about to break, but this might, of course, be 
no more than a prelude. In theory, the crash cannot come until

be expected and perhaps it is better so. Another thing which 
considerably restrains speculators over here is the high price of all 
raw materials, particularly silk, cotton and wool, where it is far 
from SAFE to do anything at all. When the CRASH comes, however, 
there'll be a rude awakening for the English. I should like to know 
how many of the Continent's speculative shares have found their 
way to England—vast numbers, I imagine. This time there'll be a

Europe's industry in ruins, all markets over-stocked (already 
nothing more is being shipped to India), all the propertied classes 
in the soup, complete bankruptcy of the bourgeoisie, war and 
profligacy to the nth degree. I, too, believe that it will all come to 
pass in 1857, and when I heard that you were again buying 
furniture, I promptly declared the thing to be a dead certainty 
and offered to take bets on it.

know he's not without esprit}1  But there's also much esprit de 
mauvais aloi c in his writing, in particular a great deal of the style 
amphigourique 0 which the French have been at such tremendous 
pains to acquire since they became 'profound' and ceased being 
superficial Voltairians. Also much of that enthusiastic unguent 
used by 'unappreciated' nationalities to glorify their passé* Hatred 
of Russia and even more of Germany; anti-Pan-Slavism but, on the 
other hand, free CONFEDERATION of Slav nations with the Poles as the 
peuple Archimede? 1 Distinct emphasis on social revolution in Poland 
as the basic condition of the political one; but seeks to show by 
means of historical deduction, which proves exactly the reverse, 
that orthodoxy lies in restoring the old agrarian communes 
(gmina=the Russian commune latinised). 
In the past few weeks I have been studying the question of 
silver in greater detail and shall in due course give you an account 
thereof.

As regards the Urquhartites (who, until the week before last, 
with intervals, were reprinting my old stuff revised by me ) have 
made no progress at all as yet. However the matter must be 
decided before the week is out. Urquhart has been playing the 
oracle in The Morning Herald by disgorging these things, which 
are wholly new to him, as though they were long-cherished secrets 
of his. In the National-Zeitung the great Bûcher —appropriating 
my very words—spoke of 'interesting revelations', but suppresses 
my name, giving the impression that they came from the English 
side.  You can see how envious and irritating these scoundrels are.

[Draft] [London,] 23 October 1856 
Dear Sir, 
Having been absent from London during the last month, and 
seeing that your paper professed to be wanting space, I have 
deferred the continuation of my articles until to day. In 
transmitting the inclosed new manuscript it occurs to me that, 
from the difference in size between the old and new Free Press,99 
it would be desirable to come to a new understanding as to 
the terms on which my contributions to your paper are to take 
place. 
In answer to your last letter I have to state that it is indifferent 
to me whether you reprint the old pamphlets in large or small type, 
but as to documents never before published I consider it would be 
spoiling the case to put them in small type. Concerning the alleged 
desirability of my own comments not taking the form of notes, you 
will see that this is being done only where really expedient, and 
that under the form of introductions to the different chapters they 
occupy already the space of the text. Lastly as to the suggestion of 
drawing parallelisms between the epoch I treat upon and the 
present time, it has been anticipated to a certain extent in the 
chapters you published. To trace systematically these parallelisms 
more would be altering my plan, which is rather to give new 
materials for a new history, than new reflections on well-known 
materials. To satisfy the wants of his readers in that respect I hold 
to be rather the duty of the editor.

Dear Engels, 
The article on Bazancourt60  is splendid. Enclosed the last bit of 
the Mieroslawski. 3 If I have seemed lazy about writing it is largely 
because my wife has been ill these past few months. 
As you will yourself observe in the Mieroslawski, 1. the very 
man who holds un royaume diplomatique* in Poland to be 
impossible, wanted to bring about une révolution diplomatique there, 
i.e. under the AUSPICFS OF Louis Bonaparte and Palmerston; 2. the 
fate of the 'democratic' gmina of the Lechites c in Poland is an 
inevitable one; the actual dominiumd  is usurped by the Crown, 
aristocracy, etc.; the patriarchal relations between dominium and 
peasant communities lead to serfdom; optional land-division 
creates a kind of peasant middle  estate,  the ordre  équestre, 101 to which 
the peasant can rise only so long as wars of conquest and 
colonisation are still in progress, though both these necessarily 
tend to accelerate his DOWNFALL. AS soon as the borderline is 
reached, this ordre équestre, incapable of sustaining the role of a 
true middle estate, turns into the lumpenproletariat of the 
aristocracy. A similar fate overtakes dominium and peasant among 
the Romanic population of Moldavia, Wallachia, etc. This type of 
development is interesting in that it shows how serfdom comes 
into being as a result of purely economic factors, without the 
intermediate link of conquest or racial dualism. 
Your Manchester Guardian has the singular distinction of being 
regarded as the immediate cause of Bonaparte's statement against 
the English press. Please send me Xe from time to time. Having

bending every effort to jockey him into precisely the same position 
as he jockeyed Louis Philippe during the Sonderbund War 102— 
into an alliance with Russia against England. Whereas on the one 
hand he takes him in tow against Austria in the filthy Neapolitan 
affair, in Turkey he sides against him with Austria.1 Once again 
the French newspapers are full of MISGIVINGS about the machina­
tions of perfidious Albion. The commercial crisis would certainly 
seem to have reached its consummation in the Russian railways. 
The bankruptcy of the CONTRACTORS to the 'palace of international 
industry'I04 affords a GLIMPSE into the participation of English 
capitalists in continental enterprises. In Germany the setting-up of 
industrial and banking undertakings goes on briskly. The Berlin 
National-Zeitung contains whole columns devoted solely to 
enumerating the names of these CONCERNS. 
I learnt from Putnam's man, Olmsted, and an American 
travelling companion who was with him that Gurowski (the Pole) 
had acquired much influence with Dana. At the same time these 
gentlemen told me that the said worthy fellow received regular 
cash grants direct from the Russian ambassade' 1 in Washington. 
This Gurowski advocated Pan-Slavism in opposition to ourselves, 
which was the only reason why your article ' was rejected. When 
returning my manuscript on the Danubian Principalities, 3 Mr Dana 
forgot TO BLOT OUT a comment written in French by this self-same 
Gurowski, who remarks on my statistical data relating to the 
Romanian population: 
'Tous ces chiffres sont exagérés pour faire mousser l'idée de nationalité 
Roumaine. Ils sont démentis par les faits, l'histoire et la logique.'1" 
So we can boast of having, or rather of having had, our articles 
inspected and censored directly by the Russian embassy. In the 
end Dana appears also to have seen through Gurowski. 
Today a letter from Collet to whom I had sent some new  stuff. b 
The fellow agrees to everything, except that he doesn't say 
anything about MONETARY TERMS although I expressly asked him 
about this point in my last letter. So I shall have to PUT  ON THE SCREW 
all over again, since this is the only point of interest to me in my

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 17 November 1856 
Dear Marx, 
Day after day this accursed COMMERCE has prevented me from 
writing. I now have three lads to keep in control and am forever 
checking, correcting, telling off and giving orders. Add to 
this the running battle with manufacturers over bad yarn or 
late delivery, and my own work. I wish it might occur to Mr 
Bonaparte to rid France of his own person and me of all this 
turmoil. 
Come to that, the said Bonaparte is in damned hot water. The 
spate of stories about placards and the unrest among the workers 
sent in by the Times correspondent, after the Moniteur article 3 
had led to his being ordered de parler plus haut, h have made an 
enormous impression on the English philistines here. 105 Everyone 
believes in his SPEEDY DOWNFALL. The explanation for the sudden 
discovery that, au fond, c the fellow is after all an ass and indeed of 
a very ordinary kind, is as follows: he used to be a genius but has 
now so ruined himself by his profligate way of life that it 
has affected his brain. While there may, of course, be some­
thing in this, the fellow's behaviour has on the whole been quite

consistent, and only the English philistines can see any qualitative 
difference between the man he used to be and the man he is 
now. 
Today's Guardian contains some interesting statistics about 
bankruptcies in France; I am sending it to you. 
It looks as though the financial crisis will linger on through the 
winter, becoming gradually more acute though with occasional ups 
and downs. This means that in the spring it will be considerably 
worse than if it had broken out in acute form now. The greater 
the capital paid in to companies hitherto existing largely on paper 
and the greater the extent to which floating capital becomes fixed, 
the better. So long as the discount rate doesn't fall below 7 per 
cent—and the recent rise shows that it will have to be raised yet 
further—there is no prospect that even half the speculative 
companies will be able to obtain payment for their third or fourth 
calls.  The Austrian Crédit mobilier 06 can't even collect the money 
for its second call, and yet the government enters into agreements 
in Austria, by which the Bank is compelled to resume CASH 
PAYMENTS!  — I'd like to have the money Bonaparte has probably 
spent over the past 6 weeks to keep government stocks above 66 
per cent; precisely because of the great efforts made towards that 
end, I shall account the day a turning-point when government 
stocks first drop below  66. 107 
The longer this chronic PRESSURE goes on, the more numerous 
will be the revelations concerning the dirty work of the Bonapar-
tist clique and the greater the rage of the working-men who could 
not previously have been aware of the details. This chap Morny is 
really a prime example of a suitier,* nor would he seem to have 
any wish to return to Paris; for him, certainly, there could be no 
more appropriate way to invest his money than in Russian railways 
and government paper. 
Never again, perhaps, will the revolution find such a fine tabula 
rasa as now. All socialist DODGES exhausted, the compulsory 
employment of labour anticipated and EXPLODED 6 years since, no 
opportunity for new experiments or slogans. On the other hand, 
however, the difficulties will be starkly in evidence; the bull will 
have to be taken literally by the horns, and I'd dearly like to see 
how the next French provisional government will set about cutting 
its teeth. Nothing, luckily, can be done this time except by dint of 
the most reckless courage, for we no longer have any reason to 
fear as swift an ebb as in 1848.

Strohn has been here recently; had heard sundry things about 
the litde man 3; entre novs, the fellow is thinking seriously about 
setting up in business on his own! He imagines his patter will serve 
to entice customers away from his present principal. 
I have in front of me at this moment James' Naval History of 
England, 1792-1820, mainly for the sake of  SHIPS  AGAINST  WALLS.  b It 
shows that the English had to fight very hard to gain NAVAL 
SUPERIORITY over the French and, more especially, the Spanish. 
Given parity of strength, the French and Spanish, during the early 
years of the war, were a match for the English on almost every 
occasion, and a mass of vessels was captured from the latter. 
Though I haven't yet got beyond 1796, I can already see that 
under Napoleon the French fleet reached an absolute nadir, for 
which he was probably partly to blame.—The superiority of the 
English at sea lies chiefly in their better gunnery; the French 
always fired too high, though the Spanish were much better. The 
story about the Vengeur, said to have gone down on 1 June 
1794 au cri de vive la république' is, by the way, a myth. The 
Vengeur surrendered to the English but, before she was actually 
seized, several French vessels again began to close; she 
rehoisted the French flag, the rescuers were beaten off and 
the English approached, but the ship went down, most of 
her crew being saved. She sank 4-6 hours after the end of 
the batde.

Dear Frederic, 
My wife is still dosing herself continually and hence the house is 
always in such a disarray that it is difficult for me to settle down 
and write. 
As regards the Mieroslawski,3  a providential 'apportionment' 
would appear to have taken place, most of the excerpts intended 
for you (there were ABOUT two sheets) having been torn out of the 
middle of the manuscript, probably for spills. However, you 
haven't lost much. I afterwards read Lelewel's Considérations —not 
to be confused with his popular history. b He, together with 
Maciejowski (?) (I cite the name from memory), provides most of 
the material upon which Mieroslawski exercises his mind. By the 
by, in my recent studies of Polish history, what led me décidément 
to plump for Poland was the historical fact that the intensity and 
the viability of all revolutions since 1789 may be gauged with fair 
accuracy by their attitude towards Poland. Poland is their 'external' 
thermometer. This is demonstrable en détail from French history. 
It is conspicuous in our brief German revolutionary period, 
likewise in the Hungarian. Of all the revolutionary governments, 
including that of Napoleon I, the Comité du salut public 109 is an 
exception only in as much as it refused to intervene, not out of 
weakness, but out of 'mistrust'. In 1794 it sent for the employé' of 
the Polish insurgents' 1 and asked this citoyen' the following 
questions: 
'How is it diat your Kosciusko, a popular dictator, tolerates the existence 
alongside himself of a king' of whom, moreover, he cannot but know that he was 
put on the throne by Russia? How is it that your dictator does not dare effect the

to Considérations sur l'état politique de l'ancienne Pologne et sur l'histoire de son peuple 
(further in the text Marx quotes a passage from it in free translation), which 
constitutes Part 2 of Volume 2 of Joachim Lelevel's Histoire de Pologne. Part 1 of

levée en masse of the peasants for fear of the aristocrats, who do not wish to be 
deprived of any of their "hands"? How is it that the revolutionary complexion of his 
proclamations pales in proportion to the distance his march removes him from 
Cracow? How is it that he immediately punished with the gallows the popular 
insurgents in Warsaw, whereas the aristocratic "traîtres de la patrie"" are allowed to 
remain at large, or are given refuge in the lengthy formalities of a trial? Answer! ' 
Whereat the Polish 'citoyen' could only remain silent. 
Que dites-vous de Neuchâtel et Valangin? bn0 This CASE has led me 
to try and remedy my highly inadequate knowledge of Prussian 
history. INDEED AND INDEED, never has the history of the world 
produced anything so sordid. How the nominal kings of France 
came to be real kings is also one long recital of petty struggle, 
betrayal and intrigue, but it is the history of the birth of a nation. 
Austrian history—the founding of a dynasty by a vassal of the 
German Empire—acquires interest from the circumstance that the 
vassal defrauds himself in his capacity as Emperor, from 
involvement in the East, Bohemia, Italy, Hungary, etc., and finally, 
too, from the circumstance that dynasty assumes such dimensions 
as to arouse fears in Europe of its becoming a universal monarchy. 
Nothing of all this in Prussia. She failed to subdue so much as one 
powerful Slav nation, and took 500 years to acquire Pomerania, 
and then only by 'barter'. 111 Come to that, the Margraviate of 
Brandenburg—as it was when taken over by the Hohenzollerns— 
hasn't been able to boast a single conquest, with the exception of 
Silesia. Perhaps it is because this was her one and only conquest that 
Frederick II's sobriquet is 'the One and Only'.1  2 Petty theft, 
BRIBERY,  outright purchase, succession intrigue, and such like shabby 
dealings is all that Prussian history really boils down to. What is 
interesting in feudal history elsewhere—the struggle of the 
monarch against his vassals, double-dealing with the towns, etc.—is 
all of it here dwarfed to a caricature because the towns are 
boringly small-minded, the feudal lords boorishly insignificant and 
the monarch himself a nonentity. During the Reformation, as 
during the French Revolution, she oscillated between perfidy, 
neutrality, separate peace treaties and snatching at scraps tossed to 
her by Russia in the course of partitions organised by the 
latter—vide Sweden, Poland, Saxony. Withal, a dramatis personae 
of rulers with only 3 masks—the Pietist,113 the non-commissioned 
officer, the clown—succeeding one another as surely as night 
follows day, the only irregularity consisting not in the introduction 
of fresh characters but in the varying order of their appearance.

What has kept the State on its legs nonetheless is mediocrity—aurea

DEAR  Frederic, 
D'abord" my best wishes for the New Year, albeit retrospective. 
As a result of watery ink and several nights' writing, one of my 
eyes is so inflamed that writing is irksome to me. 
Both the £5 (the second) and the MOUNTAIN WARFAREb received. 
For both of them  MY  BEST  THANKS. 
Is it true that Lupus has again been attacked and robbed by 
Manchester highwaymen? Or is the rumour circulating here 
simply an indiscriminate rehash of the old story? 
The best thing old Hill can do is retire, either to paradise or to 
some idyllic Swiss HILL, SO that he has to be replaced once and for 
all in your office and can no longer saddle you with double the 
work under the  FALSE  PRETENCE  of his 'temporary' illnesses. 
The Neuchâtel question n0 isn't quite so close to settlement as 
some papers make out. Both sides may already have gone too far 
with their braggadocio. Both have already brought discredit upon 
themselves: our Hohenzollernc  with his déférence for Bonaparte, 
the Swiss with their 'dignified' attitude. Thus the rascals have 
deported several hundred factory workers to Piedmont because of 
their propagandist demonstrations. In this way the 'lenders' d hope to 
secure the esteem of Bonaparte and of Austria,  TOO.  What do you 
make of Lamoricière and Bedeau offering their  épées"  to the Swiss 
burghers? Obviously just an anti-Bonaparte gesture, since the 
a First - b  F. Engels, 'Mountain Warfare in the Past and Present'. - c Frederick

and Bürger (citizens, also burghers). The allusion is to the Swiss bankers who extended 
loans to French manufacturers. - e swords

fellows could be sure the lenders of Switzerland would not take them 
at their word. 
There is great excitement in the petite démocratie. Just the kind 
of clash they want. On top of that, of course, your South German 
patriot regards the Swiss as kinsmen and in fact sees in the present 
clash nothing but a sequel to the 1849 campaign for the 
Constitution. 1 6 In addition, risings are expected in the Black 
Forest, etc. The Prussian, for his part, is certainly doing 
everything in his power to prevent A  BREACH  OF THE  PEACE'.  That is why 
Fattya wrote to his brother-in-lawb in Petersburg in terms 
reminiscent of the man who bade his wife stay him lest he jump 
out of the window. 'Stay me!' is a call our hereditary monarch has 
addressed to each of the great powers in turn. The question is 
whether they want to 'hold him back' and whether East and West, 
delighting equally in his discomfiture, will not add fuel to the 
flames. Whichever way the thing turns out, there will be no lack of 
red faces. 
Proudhon is in process of bringing out an 'economic bible'c  in 
Paris.  Destruam et aedificabo. 6 The first part, or so he says, was set 
forth in the  Philosophie de  la misère."  The second he is about to 'reveal'. 
The scribble is appearing in German, translated by Ludwig Simon 
now duly installed as clerk with Königswärter (or some such name, 
the well-known banker to the National) in Paris. I have here 
a recent piece by one of Proudhon's disciples: De la Réforme des 
Banques par Alfred Darimon, 1856. Same old tale. The démonétisa­
tion de l'or et de l'argent, or rather que toutes  les marchandises should be 
transformed into instruments d'échange au même titre que  l'or et l'argent. 1 
The piece has an introduction by Emil Girardin and betrays evident 
admiration for Isaac Péreire. Hence it enables one to get some idea 
of the kind of socialist coups d'état Bonaparte thinks himself capable 
of resorting to, even at the eleventh hour. 
I have a whole LOT  [OF]  PAMPHLETS written by Bruno Bauer during 
the Russian war.117 Feeble and pretentious. In company with his 
brother Egbert the worthy fellow has now rented from the Berlin 
municipality 50 acres of land outside Berlin. The intention is that

SOMETHING  OF THE SORT—should  look after  the  'market side'. Bruno 
has written  to  Edgar telling  him  that this  is the way to 
'independence'.  He is  paying  a rent  of 5  reichstalers  PER ACRE,  i.e. 
250 reichstalers  a year.  It's old  fallow land. Bruno hopes that  the 
profit  and the  produce from this land will enable  him to  write  at 
leisure  his  Geschichte  des  Urchristentums, 1 ]8 intended  as an  'historical' 
test-piece  for his  critique  of the  Gospels. 3 Nice critical fantasies 
these,  and to  some extent Bruno  may  have been influenced  by the 
recollection that  in Part  2 Faust becomes  a land-owner.b Only  he 
forgets that Faust obtained  the  money  for  that transformation 
from  the  Devil. 
Lallerstedt,  La Scandinavie,  ses  craintes  et ses  espérances, Swedish 
pendant  to Mieroslawski's book. c Contains  one or two  FACTS  of 
interest.  In  particular Lallerstedt recognises that, during  the  last 
century, England  was  constantly playing Russian tricks  on Sweden. 
Recounts  how  Admiral Norris, sent  by  England  on an  ostensibly 
anti-Russian mission after  the  death  of Charles  XII, was  bribed  by 
Peter  I with  a precious stone  of great value. Also  has new  material 
that throws light  on the  behaviour  of Bernadotte.

Dear Engels, 
Edgar von Westphalen has sent over a man—address en­
closed—with two letters, one for me, and one for you. This man 
Erich wishes to establish connections with London business men 
and then return to New York. He has recommendations from 
New York, but none from England. With regard to Edgar's letter, 
he has given you and myself as references, you as an English 
merchant, me as correspondent of the New-York Tribune. I told 
him that we couldn't possibly provide information about his 
financial circumstances, since we knew nothing of them. REPLY: 
neither were we required to do so, but only to confirm, if asked, 
that he was 'Erich' of New York and had been 'recommended' to 
us from that quarter. IT  IS ALTOGETHER  A SILLY  BUSINESS  of the kind often 
initiated by Edgar. The fellow seems to be a decent sort of chap 
and I couldn't, of course, tell him that a recommendation from my 
brother-in-law was likely to be more of a hindrance than a help, 
even in our case. As regards  yourself,  I naturally made no 
promises but merely undertook to send you Edgar's letter, at the 
same time informing you that the 'recommendation', if requested, 
should au fond"  be restricted to confirming the man's identity. 
Cornelius will shortly be leaving London. Is to be manager of a 
joint stock mining company in Nassau. He has offered Roesgen's

Dear Engels, 
I really have monumentally bad luck! For the past 3 weeks or so 
Mr Dana has been sending me the daily Tribune—obviously with 
the sole intention of showing me that they aren't publishing any 
more of my  stuff.  Except for some 40 lines on the MOVES of the 
Banque de France, a not a single line of mine has been included. 
Week after week I have put off drawing anything on the Tribune 
in the belief that the articles would sooner or later appear. BUT 
NOTHING  OF THE SORT.  My articles on Prussia, Persia, Austria all 
regularly REJECTED. 1" Having for some 4 years printed all my things 
(and yours  TOO)  under their own name, the curs have succeeded in 
eclipsing the name I was making for myself among the Yankees 
and which would have enabled me to find another paper, or to 
hold over their heads the threat of transferring to one. Que faire?c 
Good advice is valuable IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. As soon as I draw 
something they will make it a pretext to get rid of me once and 
for all; and writing two articles a week in the hope of having 
perhaps one in ten published and paid for is a procedure too 
ruinous to carry on. And how can I draw anything unless 
something is published? 
And then another piece of bad luck. I've had a look at the 
November, December and January numbers of Putnam's. No sign 
of the article ond Bazancourt.60 Either it has got lost (although I 
took it to the main POST OFFICE myself) or it will not be coming 
out until later. I can't believe that the fellows had got the thing, 
don't want to publish it and fail to notify me out of sheer bad 
manners! 
I have not yet succeeded in arranging any definite terms with 
a 'The Crisis in Europe' - b A reference to Marx's articles 'The Right Divine of the 
Hohenzollerns', 'The Anglo-Persian War' and 'The Maritime Commerce of Austria' 
(two articles) all of which were published in the Tribune later. - c What is to be

the Urquhartites,3 and besides, theirs is a tiny little sheet which 
may bring out short fragments of an article over a month and 
often not finish it off for 5 to 6 weeks.61 At best they can serve 
only as a small, secondary source of income. The Tribune, in 
exceedingly poor and insipid LEADERS, is moreover adopting a view 
almost diametrically opposed to all that I write. RUSSIAN INFLUENCE is 
unmistakable.b 
So here I am, without any prospects and with growing domestic 
liabilities, completely stranded in a house into which I have put 
what little cash I possessed and where it is impossible to scrape 
along from day to day as we did in DEAN STREET. '" I am utterly at a 
loss what to do, being, indeed, in a more desperate situation than 
5 years ago. I thought I had tasted the bitterest dregs of life. Mais 
non! And the worst of it is that this is no mere passing crisis. I 
cannot see how I am to extricate  myself. 
The miserable collapse of Switzerland's braggadocio 121  was only 
to be anticipated. In no way were the fellows driven  TO  EAT  DIRT by 
force supérieure. For, as Cornelius saw with his own eyes in Paris, 
the discontent, not only among Parisians, but in the army as well, 
was so great that in no circumstances could Bonaparte have 
permitted the Prussians to carry out serious military operations— 
on the French frontier least of all. Hence his EFFORTS to settle the 
affair. The discredit of the Swiss is only matched by that of 
Bonaparte, who first offered to stand surety for Switzerland 
vis-à-vis the Prussians and vented his spleen in the Moniteur when 
Switzerland repudiated his authority; then offered to stand surety 
for Prussia vis-à-vis Switzerland, and now finds himself compelled 
to admit, in little semi-official articles, that Prussia refuses to enter 
into any obligation towards  himself.  He has virtually endorsed the 
démenti he received from the Neue Preussische Zeitung. 122 So low 
has the fellow sunk. In the meantime his half-brother, Morny, has 
had the foresight to secure for himself a post in the Russian 
service. 
I don't know whether you've seen that Mr Ledru-Rollin has 
publicly invited the French 'Republicans' to take part in the 
elections of Boustrapa's40  Corps législatif 123? So he has descended 
to the naïveté of legal opposition. While this shows on the one 
hand that he has relinquished the grandiloquent title of pretender, 
it shows beyond a doubt on the other that opposition is again

considered feasible actually inside France, and that the bourgeois 
Republicans are hastening to resume, along with the Orleanists,124 
a position in parliament that will enable them to shuffle the next 
revolution under the carpet. 
I think I have already told you that the Brussels Nation has gone 
under, being now replaced by its rival the National, an inane, 
uninteresting Belgian gossip sheet. The noble L'Homme, too, has 
breathed its last. In its stead there appeared a Journal des Proscrits 
which proved incapable of surviving for more than a fortnight. In 
addition, diminutive pamphlets after the manner of Pyat's Ave 
Maria are published from time to time by the French réfugiés — 
inflated, hollow verbiage—printed crinoline save that they cost less 
to produce and are harder to sell. 
The Tribune has discovered that, during the past 30 years (up 
till 1851), France has enriched herself far more than England and 
thus is now also her superior politically.* The  proof.  In France, the 
value (i.e. nominal) of landed property has increased twofold, in 
England not so much. True, the French estimate included houses 
while the English one did not; but since the English population 
increased by only 33 per cent in the area concerned, the same 
could be assumed of the number of houses (which the Tribune 
appears to equate with their value). 
Erich has achieved his purpose here without any need for 
further references.

Dear Marx, 
Your letter arrived like a bolt from the blue. I had believed that 
everything was going splendidly at last—you in a decent house 
and the whole BUSINESS settled; and now it turns out that 
everything's in doubt. What damned stingy fellows these Yankees 
are; the people on the Tribune seem to imagine that, having 
squeezed you like a lemon, they must now proceed to squeeze 
another one. But the manner in which they are trying to break 
things off is particularly mean and cowardly. They want to force 
you to take the initiative. Furthermore, ever since Cluss fell so 
strangely silent, we've not had one reliable man in the whole of 
America. 
Que faire cependant?" Since the Tribune is definitely intent on 
breaking with you this time, I think the best thing would be to 
establish connections with another New York paper. Might not 
something be arranged with the Herald or the Times? b In your 
place I would at once make a move and keep the chaps on the 
Tribune dangling until everything is arranged. In view of the 
fellows' shabby behaviour you need only consult your own 
interests and show no consideration for them. If you think that an 
indirect move w.ould be better, let me know. I will gladly carry out 
the negotiations in my name, so that you shan't be compromised; I 
could write saying I have reason to believe that you don't get on as 
well as you used to with the Tribune people and that some 
arrangement might perhaps be made, etc., etc. Enfin" anytfiing you 
want, pourvu que quelque chose soit faite. d 
I wouldn't put it beyond the Tribune fellows to have stirred up 
trouble with Putnam too. I should write at once to Putnam to clear 
the matter up. One doesn't even know whether to write the article on 
coastal fortifications or not.e At all events it would be advisable to 
keep this source of income open as well. 
I shall send you £5 early in February and for the time being 
you can count on getting this every month. Even if it means my

facing the new financial year with a load of debts, c'est égal? I only 
wish you had told me about the business a fortnight earlier. For 
my Christmas present my old man gave me the money to buy a 
horse and, as there was a good one going, I bought it last week. If 
I'd known about this business of yours I would have waited a 
month or two and saved the cost of its keep. But NEVER  MIND,  that 
doesn't have to be paid for straight away. But I'm exceedingly 
vexed that I should be keeping a horse here while you and 
your family are down on your luck in London. It goes without 
saying, by the way, that you shouldn't let the promise of £5 a 
month deter you from approaching me again in case of hardships, 
for if anything can be done I shall do it. Anyhow, I've got to turn 
over a new  leaf;  I've been leading far too frivolous an existence of 
late. 
Warm regards to your wife and children and let me know soon

influence  to bear.127 
To work  for The  New-York Herald  is out of the  question;  The 
New-York Times  is the one to go for. I am  thinking  of approaching 
them unobtrusively through  Dr Abraham Jacobi,  who is at  least 
discreet  and  whose quiet manner seems  to impress  the  Yankees 
GENERALLY.  I intend  to write  to him  next Tuesday,  and at the  same 
time to Dana  in such  a manner  as will at any  rate involve  him in a 
contretemps more disagreeable than  he had  bargained  for. I 
should  be grateful  if you  could  let me  have  by Tuesday—after 
Tuesday  I shall probably discontinue  the  articles  for the  Tribune 
pending further news from  New  York—a military article  on 
Persia. 11 No need  for  much detail this time. Just  a few  general 
strategic VIEWS.  The  Tribune probably imagines that,  now  they have 
turned  me out, I  shall resign myself  to abandoning  the  American 
camp altogether.  The  prospect  of their 'military'  and  'financial' 
monopoly going over  to another paper  is hardly likely  to please 
them. Accordingly,  I have  today  sent them  a 'financial' piece.  28 An 
introduction  to the  Persian war,129 however cursory, would  be 
important because  it would give them  to understand that  we still 
have  a 'WAR'  up our  sleeves with which other papers could  be 
helped  to make  a splash.  The  (military) prospects  of the  Russians 
and English need only  be hinted  at, of  course. 
So I shall postpone  any  outright rupture until  I find  out 
whether  I can fix  anything  up elsewhere  in New  York.  If I  cannot 
and the  Tribune,  for its  part, does  not  change  its attitude, then  the 
break will have  to be  made,  of course.  But in a  sordid contest like 
this I believe  it important  to gain time.  It seems  to me the  Tribune 
has come  to believe that, since  the  'great turn' taken  by events  in 
America,1S0  it can  dispense with  all special editions (European 
ones,  at least).  It's truly nauseating that  one  should  be condemned 
to count  it a  blessing when taken aboard  by a  blotting-paper 
vendor such  as this.  To  crush  up bones, grind them  and  make 
them into soup like PAUPERS  in the WORKHOUSE—that's  what  the 
political work  to which  one is  condemned  in such large measure  in 
a CONCERN like this boils down  to. I am  aware  I have been  an ass in 
giving these laddies more than their money's worth—not just 
recently  but for  years past. 
Pieper  is taking  a schoolmaster's post SOMEWHERE between 
Portsmouth  and  Brighton;  has  been chasing after something  of 
the kind  for  months.

Dear Engels, 
An ACKNOWLEDGMENT, in great haste, of the pounds that arrived 
today. 
Enclosed a letter from Miquel. I wrote to him at once. The 
situation as regards the Tribune is as I foresaw. Once again not a 
word. So today I wrote the fellows a forthright letter as I had 
originally intended but did not tell them that meanwhile—until 
their answer arrives—I shall discontinue my articles entirely.

Dear Engels, 
Enclosed a letter from Olmsted in reply to my inquiry. So this 
particular  ARTICLE  wasn't accepted.131 However, even after this letter 
I believe that they will be glad to publish  'SHIPS  AGAINST  WALLS'.3 The 
question is, have you got the time to write it? No doubt we ought 
to try Putnam again before giving up altogether. At any rate it 
was exceedingly impertinent of that gendeman not to let me know 
what the position was until after 4 months. Since I shall in any 
case have to write to Olmsted, see if you can make out his 
Christian name from this letter. 
You will probably have had Miquel's letter. Freiligrath tells me 
that, besides Ruge and Hess, Oppenheim and other disreputable 
good-for-nothings write for the Jahrhundert. 
Freiligrath requests you not to let the matter of Weerth remain 
dormant. Assuming that that Jew Steinthal has got his hands on 
Weerth's diaries (about which the noble Campe has already written 
to Weerth's brother 6), there is the additional danger that, should 
Weerth's relations get hold of them, they might in usum delphini" 
publish them amended and censored. It is to be hoped that 
Weerth's brother will approach you direct. If the diaries eventually 
turn up, this would also mean that you could appeal to the 
philistines' consciences. Incidentally, it is exceedingly mean of 
Steinthal to have no more than bluntly notified the old woman d of 
Weerth's death, without any details and without either preamble 
or postscript. That haggler with his saccharine smirk! 
I have been rereading (but haven't quite finished) your essays 
on Pan-Slavism, " partly for my own edification, partly in order to 
note the passages which, in the event of a German version, would 
necessitate your referring to sources not readily available in 
a See this volume, p. 96. - b Karl Weerth - c Literally: for the use of the dauphin

England save at the  British Museum. While thus engaged  I 
discovered that  the  same unknown hand (provisionally  I make  so 
bold as to  ascribe  it to the  Polish renegade Gurowski) which wrote 
above  my  rejected  DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIES  articles," 'Tout  ces chiffrés 
sont éxagérés', b etc., etc.  (nice French),  has  also adorned  the 
Pan-Slavism articles with marginal glosses,  viz.: 
adc article  I. At the end: 2.  C'est  ni bon. d (What  the £ is 
supposed  to be  (German  C?)  is beyond  me.)  (Nice French sentence! 
C'est  ni bon.  Period.) 
ad article  IX.  Written  at the top:  Changez l'introduction 11 and,  as 
heading: 'Southern  Slavï. 
Again, re the sentence,  'BY  THIS  LOGIC ETC.  IT WOULD  FOLLOW  THAT THE 
HINDOOS  ARE THE  MOST  YOUTHFUL PEOPLE ETC'  he comments,  'THIS  DEDUCTION 
IS ILLOGICAL'. 
On the  statistical survey  of the  Serbian race:  'GERMAN  (instead  of 
GERMAN) INFLUENCES DESTROYED THEM  IN  OTHER BRANCHES UNDER AUSTRIAN 
DOMINION.'  (Nice English!) Again,  on  your censure  of Montenegrin 
BRIGANDAGE,  THIS  (instead of 'TIS)  NOT TRUE'. 
Again, on  'CROATIA  ETC.  HAVE  FOR  CENTURIES  PAST  BEEN  ANNEXED  TO 
HUNGARY',  he comments,  'BUT  HUNGARY  IS A  COMPOUND  OF THOSE  VARIOUS 
LANDS'. 
The passage about  the  Mohammedan Bosnians,  'THEY WILL  HAVE  TO 
BE EXTERMINATED,  NO  DOUBT ABOUT THAT'  is distorted  in  true Russian 
fashion  by  striking  out the  next passage:  'THESE ARE, HOWEVER, BUT THE 
INTERNAL  DIFFICULTIES OPPOSING THE ERECTION  OF A  SOUTH SLAVONIC EMPIRE  ETC' 
That these notes  are all of  Russian inspiration  is obvious. 
Likewise, that  no  Frenchman could have written French with this 
kind  of ACCENTUATION  and  such mistakes; likewise  and no  less, that  a 
Yankee would never talk about 'Southern Slavi'  and  would express 
himself altogether differently. Hence  I should  say  that  the 
provenance  of these notes  is beyond doubt.  And if, as  Olmsted's 
(Yankee) travelling companion maintained  in  front  of  myself, 
Freiligrath  and  Olmsted, Gurowski  is in the  direct  pay of the 
Russian Embassy  in Washington,  the  whole crisis with  the  Tribune 
becomes perfecdy explicable.  By the by,  from  the  notes  and 
deletions  it transpires that originally  it was  still intended  to publish 
a modified version  of the  articles  on  Pan-Slavism  (up to and 
perhaps including  No. 9), and  that  the  idea  was not  completely 
abandoned until  the  fellow realised what  we  were driving  at. 
Hence,  too,  Dana's belated decision.

Since, in the midst of my own crisis, it is very edifying for me to 
hear about crises, drop me a few lines telling me how things are in 
the industrial districts. Not at all well, according to the reports in 
the London papers. 
The two final volumes of Tooke's History of Prices—from 1849 
onwards—have come out. It is, of course, a pity that in his 
unrelenting battle with the CURRENCY chaps and Peel's Acts,132 the

...The only literary piece of Weerth's that has arrived here so far 
is a humoristic history of trade (a fragment from the Brussels-
Bradford period, 1845-47),a  but Steinthal is expecting a further 
packing case of papers. I shall most willingly do all I can to get the 
things, but it is important that Weerth's brother b should write a 
letter for me, so that I shall have some kind of authorisation. 
There should hardly be much difficulty; Steinthal is perfectly 
willing to help. But as regards details probably more than one 
point of disagreement will crop up. 
The diaries, as far as my knowledge of them from Weerth's last 
stay here goes, contain only matter-of-fact notes. 
Meanwhile, as I have already said, as soon as I am authorised to 
collect the things, I shall certainly make sure that I get 
everything....

some extent with my commercial rubbish, I discover a whole pile 
of unsuspected arrears, am overrun by chaps, have to reply to 
hundreds of business queries on behalf of my old man and pander 
to fresh whims of Mr Gottfr.'s.a Just to make sure that I am sitting 
really fast, Freiligrath saddles me with Prussian ex-lieutenants, 
dabblers in bonds, who spend the entire day trying to borrow 
money (something he, Freiligrath, himself thought fit to warn me 
against) and who, after their departure, send me pawn tickets so 
that I can redeem their watches at my own expense. I am not in 
the least obliged to Freiligrath for landing me with the importu­
nate fellow.b What is more I wrote to him today about 
my adventure with the brute. Let him clear the business up 
himself. 
Last Friday0 Mr Ernst Dronke turned up at the office all of a 
sudden from Glasgow. He was here for only an hour or two on 
business. I saw him almost exclusively in the presence of Charles,d 
when it wouldn't have done to argue with him or treat him 
roughly. On top of that his arrival was so sudden that I was 
unable to recall all of his intrigues. I treated him with reserve, just 
as I would treat an ordinary commercial traveller with whom I was 
only superficially acquainted and confined my remarks to trifling 
matters, and he was extremely careful to avoid any subject relating 
to the party. He shoved off during the afternoon and intends to 
come back in May, at which time I shall probably be in London. 
I hope he will remain a commerçant all his days; he certainly 
looks the part and the carefree existence seems greatly to his 
liking. 
I presume you got the £5 note I sent you last Friday (or was it 
Thursday?). 
The TORIES, FREETRADERS and Peelites could have done Pam no 
greater favour than put him in a minority over this question.134 
What luck the fellow has and how stupid are his opponents! There 
is a great deal of agitation up here just now, but since 4,000 new 
VOTERS are on the register, all small SHOPKEEPERS and CLERKS and 
OVERLOOKERS, and therefore predominantly pro-Bright, it is unlikely 
that there will be any change. Bob Lowe and Sir J. Potter (A BORN 
ALDERMAN 135 and once a mighty wencher) are to be nominated here. 
WILL NOT DO. YOU could probably let me have some details about 
Bob Lowe's early exploits in Australia and elsewhere. These would 
be very useful just now. 136

Dear Engels, 
You must excuse me for not having acknowledged receipt of the 
£5 or of your letter before now. My wife is very unwell and our 
domestic arrangements generally are in such a state of crisis that I 
am quite bemused and cannot write. 
Guardians received today. No answer yet from the New-York 
Tribune. The only thing I could say to Olmsted, of course, was 
that if he had failed to place the article60 with Harper, he should 
send it back. 
Proudhon's new book on economics, not yet to hand, has 
already run into 7 editions.3 
How Miquel could believe I could write for the Jahrhundert is 
beyond my comprehension—a weekly rag whose contributors are 
Rüge, L. Simon, Meyen, B. Oppenheim, M. Hess, etc. I haven't 
read any of it but have seen the cover of No. 1, Vol. 2, on which 
is printed the following list of  contents:  'Nach dem Kriege, vor der 
Entscheidung. IV. Von Arnold Rüge'. 'Briefe aus Paris, der 
Schweiz und London' (i.e., L. Simon, Kolatschek, Meyen). 'Der 
Geist unserer Zeit; zum Neujahrsgruss. Von Arnold Rüge'. 
'Naturwissenschaft und Gesellschaftslehre. V. Von M. Hess'. 
'Erziehung zum Glauben und Erziehung zur Humanität'. 
'Notiz'. 
Edgar Bauer is putting out a book, Englische Eindrücke}' Should 
be splendid. 
I shall find out the price of Mieroslawski's and LelewePs books 
(the latter's first volume nothing but a children's history).0

Décembre. 138 
Every day brings fresh revelations about Pam's 'liberal' foreign 
policy. First, the 'SECRET TREATY' with Austria.139 Now, the fact that 
he has given Bonaparte his word to suppress any kind of 
revolution in Naples. The latter, however, wanted this done only 
in so far as a 'Murat' restoration 140 was not subsumed under the 
heading 'revolution'. It was this 'MISUNDERSTANDING' which scuppered 
the Naples expedition.103 In the COMMONS yesterday Pam denied 
the charge in a very 'AMBIGUOUS MANNER'. a But this week is likely to 
see the appearance of further documents which will give him the 
lie. 
The Russians haven't acted with quite their usual circumspec­
tion this time. The first Continental paper since the crisis 
in Parliament134 to defend Pam as a 'TRULY BRITISH MINISTER' 141 
is the  Nord,  which usually affects a fanatical hatred of Pam. 
Even the Neue Preussische Zeitung speaks of 'UNPRINCIPLED COALI­
TION'. 
The Persian affair has fizzled out as I supposed: England has 
gained nothing, apart from a few nominal concessions; rather she 
has given way to the Persian court on the main issue.129 Russia, on 
the other hand, has obtained a small piece of territory, as Layard 
yesterday confided to the gaping COCKNEYS. Needless to say, he did 
not have the courage to place these two FACTS in their correct 
causal nexus. He also repeated the assertion (already made by 
Disraeli in the Lower House without eliciting a word from Pam in 
reply) that, during the war with Russia, Pam forbade the Persians to 
take an offensive stand against the Russians as had been their 
intention. For at the time the fellows had hopes of recapturing the 
provinces that had been wrested from them. He had had the same 
admonition conveyed to them at the time of the Polish revolution 
(1830). 
In order to assess correctly the Persian, as also the Chinese 
fracas, both should be compared with Pam's earlier doings in these 
REGIONS, since both are merely repetitions.142 So long as he was at 
the helm, the first Chinese war was conducted in such a way that it 
could have gone on for 100 years without any result save an 
increase in the RUSSIAN OVERLAND TEA-TRADE and a growth of Russian 
influence in Pekin. It was only under Sir Robert Peel that this war 
was given an 'English' twist by Ellenborough. 
a An account of Palmerston's speech in the House of Commons was published in The 
Times, No.  22631,  18 March 1857.

It is to be  hoped—and  is indeed probable—that this time  a 
parliament will  be returned which will pledge itself  to nothing save 
passive obedience  to Pam. The  dissolution  of the  former parties 
expressed  as a  coalition ministry, like that  of Aberdeen,14S seemed 
rather  to make  the  MIDDLE CLASS  feel able  to rest  on its  laurels than 
to alarm  it. This same dissolution expressed  as Pam's dictatorship  is 
bound  to  lead,  not  only  to the  most gratifying fiascos  and 
complications abroad,  but  also  to the  most violent agitation  if not 
to revolution  at home.  The old  boy,  who was  pardy responsible  for 
the Manchester 'massacre  en miniature'  and  helped  to draw  up the 6 
'GAGGING ACTS',  144 won't  so  much  as  turn  a hair. Mutatis mutandis, 
Pam's  DICTATORSHIP  will  be to the  coalition ministry what  the  rule  of 
the Royalists,  who  coalesced  in the  last French Assemblée,  was to 
the rule  of Bonaparte. 145 In England, things will  at last be brought 
to a head. 
Apropos Bangya. Since  1855  this same Bangya  has  been Sefer 
Pasha's adlatus.a  He has  married  the  daughter  of a  Circassian chief 
(which must  be equally gratifying  to his  lawful wife  in Pest  and his 
unlawful  one in  Paris),  and is now  himself  a Circassian  chief. 
Through  his  connections  in London  he has  recruited  300  Poles 
and shipped them  to the  BLACK  SEA  together with supplies  of 
ammunition,  etc.  According  to the  news  in the  papers, they have 
run the  gauntlet  of the  Russian  CRUISERS  and  safely reached Sefer 
Pasha.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?  The fellow, realising that his role 
was played  out in the  West,  has  embarked  on a new one in the 
Orient. Whether again  as a  democratic mouchardh  or in  good faith 
is another question. 
Write soon,  as your letters  are now  essential TO [help  me]  PLUCK

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 20 March 1857 
Dear Marx, 
It had already occurred to me that you might once again be in 
something of a hole. Whatever can be done by me, will be done. If 
at all possible I'll send you another five-pound note next week or, 
if I can't get hold of one, a POST OFFICE  ORDER.  In the latter case, be 
sure to let me know at what  POST  OFFICE I should make it payable. 
I've had very heavy debts to pay this month, with people tracking 
me down to the office, so that there was no option but to stump 
up. Otherwise you'd have had the five pounds straight away. It's 
lucky, by the way, that this parliament business has begun, with 
China thrown in for good measure 1S4; at this juncture the Tribune 
will need help again and will be forced to come to TERMS. 
I've been sounding the Guardian chap about the possibility of 
making contact with REVIEWS and MAGAZINES up here. But this chap, 
too, seems to be hunting round in the hope of fixing up 
something for himself and there's not much to be got out of him. 
However, I shall see. Since he knows my opinion of Palmerston 
and declares it to be PREPOSTEROUS he is all the less likely to give us a 
recommendation in politicis.a All the same, I have a certain  HOLD  ON 
THE FELLOW but as yet haven't devised any way of exploiting it. 
I share your view of Palmerston's intentions and prospects in 
the new parliament. Bonapartist despotism wielded by Pam 
together with a Corps  législatif. 123 We shall see what that leads to. 
According to the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung? the Circassians 
(which, not specified) have actually appointed Bangya 'head of the 
house'; he was selected for this snug berth precisely because he is 
a foreigner, so that none of the native chiefs could complain of 
having been slighted. What has become of Sefer Pasha (a man of 
quite a different stamp to Koscielski) is far from clear. I regard 
the whole thing as a stroke of genius on the part of the Russians, 
and we shall probably hear no more of the 300 Polish Spartans. H6 
The Nord must have changed its mind again. The Guardian's 
Brussels correspondent quotes passages that are violently anti-

of thing never comes my way here and in any controversy I must 
always have CHAPTER  AND  VERSE  immediately to hand. 
While putting my old newspapers in order recently, I discovered 
the loss of one of the main bundles of English papers and cuttings 
from the Guardian, Free  Press,  etc., etc. Nothing, luckily, connected 
with our party archives—they are safely stored away. But 
everything, with a few exceptions, relating to Palmerston—Tucker's 
pamphlets,147 the cuttings containing your articles you had sent 
me (many of these are also being sat on by Lupus, etc.). I needed 
and was looking for them precisely in order to refresh my 
memory as to detail. Have you got any duplicates you could send 
me, likewise the full text of your articles which appeared in 
Urquhart's London paper61? These should be fairly easy to get 
hold of. I would find the things particularly handy just now. 
Bob Lowe's prospects up here are poor. Some of the philistines 
have come out against Bright; however I believe he will scrape 
through this time. Lowe will make an ass of himself as soon as he 
arrives here. But it would be splendid were he to get in.136

(With the exception of the Hungarian affair, cribbed from 
Urquhart, the remainder has been lifted by Mr Wilks—just like 
him, of course—from my articles in the Tribune.14 *) No need for 
you to preserve numbers 1 and 2; but possibly numbers 3, 4 and 
5. Tomorrow, if I can find them, I shall send a few other 
pamphlets. As  TO THE Nord,  note that the Post itself (in one of the 
numbers appearing between 4 and 9 March) carried the article I 
have mentioned.* 1 Later, however, it changed its tune. 
Now for PRIVATE AFFAIRS. D'abord' a letter has arrived from the 
Tribune, which I shall send you as soon as I have answered it. My 
threat to write to another paper has worked after all, at least up to 
a point. Despite its very friendly tone, the letter shows that I was 
not mistaken about these gentlemen. For what they propose is to 
pay for one article a week, whether or not they print it; the second 
I send at my own risk, and draw on it if printed. Thus they are au 
fait 1 cutting me down by one  half.  However I shall agree to it and 
must agree to it Also, if things in England take the course I think 
they will, it won't be long before my income reaches its former 
level again. 
I'm very sorry that, in the meantime, I must continue to depend 
on you, having so greatly fallen into arrears that everything that 
could be pawned has been pawned and the drop in income cannot 
be made up until I have found some new resource. On top of 
that, and since I cannot after all withhold the FACT from you, my 
wife is IN HIGHLY INTERESTING  CIRCUMSTANCES.  However, all I intended in 
my last was to explain why I hadn't answered for so long— 
certainly not ANY I  HING  ELSE.  YOU will understand that even the most 
equable of men—and in a mess such as this I do INDEED possess a 
great deal of equanimity—will sometimes lose patience and let 
himself go, especially vis à vis his friends. 
I should be most grateful if you could let me have a few 
'humorous' LINES,  SAY  SO OR IOO ONES,  on the Orlandian bravery g evinced

Dear Engels, 
Received  the £5. 
I should like  you to  send  me  some Manchester Examiners  if 
convenient. The  BRIGHT PARTY'S EXPLANATIONS  are of interest to me 
just now. It is  only through their defeat that  the  election  has 
acquired  any  historical  POINT.134  Palmerston's position will become 
dangerous only  now,  when  he has a  commanding majority inside 
Parliament, whereas outside Parliament there  is a  recrudescence— 
for the  first time since  the  Anti-Corn  Law  League 15 °—of  SERIOUS 
ANTI-MINISTERIAL AGITATION.  England is entering upon a sérieuse 
crisis—as  The  Times already intimates, with  its  reference  to the 
CLOUD WHICH  IT SEES GATHERING  a—and if the  MOVE  is resumed on the 
Continent, John Bull will  not  maintain  the  stance  of supercilious 
detachment  he  adopted  in 1848.  Pam's victory marks  the 
culmination  of events which began  in June 1848.151 Amongst  the 
more intelligent members  of the  London  PUBLIC  the  news from 
Manchester, accompanied  as it was by a  commentary  in the  shape 
of Pam's brazen address  and  speech,b  was  greeted with  a kind  of 
stupefaction. Seen from here—and  all are  unanimous  on  this 
point—Manchester  has  brought disgrace, serious disgrace, upon 
itself.  Had  Punch  not  been bought  by Pam—Taylor,  a chief editor 
thereof,  has  been given  a post  at the  General Board  of Health  at a 
salary  of £1,000—Potter, Turner,  and  Garnett,  at any  rate, would 
have figured  in it  next Wednesday. Send  me  some particulars 
about these laddies  and  their  WHEREABOUTS. 
Mr Dronke  has  written  to Freiligrath telling  him  that  he  'will 
break with  his Jew and set up as an  independent agent'. 
I have provided Urquhart with some notes  on Bangyac—in view 
of the  latter's connections with Constantinople  and  Circassia.

Enclosed a cutting from Reynolds about the editor of The 
Morning Advertiser—-Mr Grant. Every word of it true. 
Also Dana's letter. Let me have it back. In his enumeration of 
the articles published he mentions only the last ones,2 and even 
some of these he didn't publish until 5 or 6 weeks after their 
arrival in New York when he saw that things were taking a new 
turn.152 His proposal re money is the best possible indication that I 
was not mistaken about the gentleman's intentions. His remark 
about the length of the articles suits me well. I shall have all the 
less to send. What strikes me, though, is that for months past he 
has been able to find 2 or 3 columns for the most insipid London 
GOSSIP. 
In Prussia too there is a minor parliamentary crisis. Once AGAIN 
the dictum 'Geniality leaves off where money matters begin'15S 
would seem to be proving true there. 
It seems highly probable that the Swiss will agree to expel all the 
refugees.

take umbrage if you were not to inform me when the SOVEREIGNS' 
armed intervention is required. I shall see how my finances go in 
April; I think I shall be able to manage a bit more during the 
second  half,  at any rate. 
The Tribune's proposal is most cunning and, since the chaps are 
practically certain to print only one article a week, I shouldn't send 
two save on special occasions such as the present elections, etc., 
etc. However, circumstances will come to your aid, and in all 
probability the good Yankees will have no reason to complain 
about the DULLNESS OF EUROPEAN POLITICS this summer and autumn, 
while their own merry-go-round will gradually come to a halt. 
I have hardly followed the Persian and Chinese military 
ventures3 at all, indeed there has been a great dearth of detail. 
About Captain Jones I know nothing. It would now be utterly 
impossible to get together the necessary material, but when we get 
fuller news about the last big cavalry attack in Persia I shall see 
what can be done. 
The pamphlets have arrived.15 If only I could get hold of your 
old Tribune articles!148 Most of the stuff is in them. Washington 
Wilksc and Palmerston for Premier contain only generalities, and 
Chisholm Anstey's speech*1  is fearfully décousu* though very 
important, more especially by reason of the personal matters 
relating to the Portfolio 154 but also, here and there, by reason of its 
contents. The only really cogent pamphlets are your two Tucker 
pamphlets, especially Unklar Skelessi. u If you can supply me with 
any more material, tant mieux* I have taken steps to improve the 
storage arrangements. 
The eight thousand philistines who voted for the fattest man in 
Manchester (Potter) because he makes up for his lack of brains by 
the size of his bottom, are already ashamed of their victory. All the 
same, the elections have made an enormous impression here, and 
the 'Manchester' Party134 is beginning to take stock of its 
performance over the past 6 years and to discover in what it has 
railed. I don't think we shall hear very much more of PEACE-PARTY 
TALK 155 for the time being, while on the other hand Bright (if he 
rallies) will, with one or two others, undoubtedly advocate a more 
far-reaching electoral reform and, before long, Jones may well 
receive some propositions from these bourgeois. For Pam the most 
gratifying thing must be his triumph over Bright, Gibson, Cobden,

will get a  WORKING MAJORITY  of 60-100. But be that as it may, wot« 
aurons du Palmerston tout pur* and  WITH  A VENGEANCE 
I've found  one of the  passages from  the  Nord in The Morning 
Post, but  only eulogising  his  abilities. b The one  in which  he appears 
as a  'TRULY  BRITISH  MINISTER'  is not to be found. 
Our local Palmerstonians  and  bourgeois offered  Bob  Lowe, 
should  he be  defeated here,  the sum of  £2,000  to  cover  his 
election expenses  in some other wretched hole.  The ass  refused, 
preferring  the  safety  of Kidderminster, only  to be  trounced there. 
But never again will  he be  able  to come  to Manchester;  he has 
behaved like  a real blackguard—first  he  allows  the  philistines  to 
compromise themselves  on his  behalf,  then cries  off and, at the 
same time, writes  an article  for The  Times  in  which  he says  it would 
be scandalous  if Manchester were  not to  return Bright.c 
This time Philistia  was  tremendously divided.  The  vast majority 
of the  bourgeoisie,  a small majority  of the  lower-middle class, 
against Bright  and  Gibson. Quakers  ' 6 and  Catholics  for  Bright  to 
a man;  the  Greeks likewise;  the  established Germans against  him.  A 
drunken anti-Bright man shouted:  'WE  WONT HAVE HOME  POLICY,  WE WANT 
FOREIGN POLICY.'  What  the  rationale  of the  local elections more  or less 
amounts  to is: To  hell with  all  questions  of  reform  and  class 
matters. After  all, we  philistines form  the  majority  of voters, cela 
suffit. 6 The  clamour against  the  aristocracy,  etc., is  tedious  and 
produces no tangible result.  WE  DEARLY LOVE  A LORD FOR  ALL THAT.  We've 
got FREE TRADE  and as  much bourgeois social reform  as we  require. 
We're flourishing like  mad,  especially since  Pam  reduced  war 
INCOME TAX.  So  let's  all  foregather  on  territory where  we are all 
equal,  and  let's  be  ENGLISHMEN,  John Bulls, under  the  leadership  of 
that  TRULY  BRITISH  MINISTER  Pam. Such is the present mood of the 
majority  of philistines. 
What  is piquant about  the  business  up  here  is the  burial  of the 
Anti-Corn  Law  League150 ; Smith  P.  Robinson (HON.  SEC)  and 
George Wilson,  'THAT RESPECTABLE FIXTURE'  are being thrown out of 
Newalls Buildings 15 and the  GREAT LIBERAL PARTY  is casting about 
for a new  organisation.  G.  Wilson loses  his  snug berth  and his 
status  on the  strength  of  which  he  rose  to be  CHAIRMAN  of the 
Lancashire  and  Yorkshire railways  at a  salary  of  £1,000  per 
annum—another snug berth that will soon  go  west, permitting

PROTECTION. But your Manchester philistine—even if a partisan of 
Bright—heaves a sigh of relief at the long-awaited demise of that 
old incubus,  THE  LEAGUE 136! 
Apropos, I believe that the Ch. Anstey pamphlet contains only a 
small part of Pam's reply2—the debate lasted 4 days. Couldn't you 
get hold of the rest? And could you send me a copy of Urquhart's 
new rag, The Free Press" or whatever it's called? What is there in it 
by you?

to let me have Dana's letter back. 
I am sending you through the parcels company a small bottle of 
eye lotion. Cornelius brought me a bottle of it from Paris, where 
he had had trouble with his eyes. For several weeks I had myself 
been suffering from inflammation of the eyes due to intensive 
work at night. The lotion put me right within a few days and will 
do you a similar service. All you have to do is put a few drops into 
the bad eye on getting up and on going to bed.

The apparent improvement on the Stock Exchanges is again 
petering out. Bank rate is rising again. Crédit mobilier 45 and 
French rentes are again going  DOWN,  while revelations of commer­
cial sharp practice by joint stock companies in London and Paris 
are becoming increasingly frequent. In the latter place, I'm glad 
to say, the government is directly involved. You have, I sup­
pose,  read about the row between Péreire and Féline? I'd have 
copied it out for you had I not assumed that The Manchester 
Guardian's [woman] correspondent CHRONICLES everything of that 
nature. I now see the Paris Figaro from time to time, the only 
real journal of the Empire; it has cast off all semblance of 
respectability. 
I don't know whether I have already drawn your attention to 
the two new pieces of evidence against Pam. First, Herbert told his 
CONSTITUENTS in South Wilts3 that he had given orders for the 
bombardment of Odessa160; upon his resigning, Pam sent an order 
written with his own hand to SPARE it. Secondly, Russell told the 
City electorateb that Palmerston had given him written instructions 
on how to conduct himself at the Congress of Vienna,161 
instructions which Clarendon forbade him to make public and in 
the execution of which LITTLE JOHN so splendidly BROKE DOWN. It's 
typical of old Pam to keep harping in his newspapers on Herbert's 
Odessa TREASON (it was Pam's popular rag, the Advertiser, that first 
drew attention to Herbert's family ties with Vorontsovc) and on 
Russell's Vienna  TREASON.162

I shall search out more anti-Palmerstoniana for you. Pam's 
speech against Anstey (a fat pamphlet) ought to be in my 
possession if Pieper hasn't pinched it from me. Lengthier works 
are Parish, Diplomatic History of Greece and Urquhart, Central 
Asia. 11 On the first topic you might also read the EXPOSITIONS by 
Thierschb  and Maurenbrecher 0 which came out in 1836 (?). (It's a 
long time since I set eyes on them.) Of all the Blue Books, 38 the one 
that has impressed me most strongly is that on the second

I've only had 5 articles in The Free  Press. 61 Liebknecht, etc., have 
filched them from me. However I'll get them together for you. In 
the last one I used the text of one of your articles, in which you 
speak of Peter I. 16S I've only just completed the introduction. But 
at first the chaps dragged their feet for months. Later, they 
brought it out rather more quickly. But now, when the first 
payment is due, I dun them in vain. If they don't do better on this

Terrace. You really are right out in the country, at the foot of 
Hampstead Hills and, if the hachures on the map are correct, in a 
highly romantic district. But if the result is nothing but ill-health, 
toothaches, swellings of the head and digestive upsets, it doesn't 
say much for country air and romanticism. At all events, I hope 
that both you and the Moor are by now feeling very much better. 
Lupus suggests that the Moor's etymology of Farina is quite 
wrong and that the Sanscrit vârinas is, rather, the root of Varina 
shag. b This answer will certainly come as no surprise to the Moor 
and should therefore not be withheld from him. A new chapter is 
about to open in old Lupus' life. Don't be alarmed—it isn't 
marriage. On the contrary, it's divorce, for he's leaving the 
LANDLADY he's been with for 3 years, and moving closer to where I 
live. The old gent is now very popular with a group of German 
clerks who come to the Chatsworth from time to time, and over 
whom he presides with great dignity every Sunday night. They 
simply couldn't live without Lupus, any more than the English 
philistines who patronise the pub. 
All eyes up here are fixed on fat Potter in anticipation of the 
day when he seconds the address in Parliament; a fine spectacle 
that will be! 
Again, best wishes for your recovery. Warm regards to the 
girls—the air out there will undoubtedly suit them better. How 
they must have grown! 
With warm regards,

Dear Engels, 
Be so kind as to write by return, telling me how to reply to the 
enclosed letter from Dana.165 I must send off an answer by 
Friday's post. 
By following Christ's precept 'if thy tooth offend thee, pluck it 
out',a I have at last found  relief,  at the same time discovering that 
this wretched tooth was the source of all the other ailments that 
have been plaguing me for months. You have located our house 
correctly. The title of Mr Edgar'sb  book is not Englische Eindrücke 
but Englische Freiheit 0 l/4 of it is said to be about Mormonism. The 
whole claims to provide the physiognomy  OR,  IF YOU  LIKE,  physiology 
of the national character. I haven't read any of it. Will write to you 
IN SOME DAYS.

occupation in the evenings. La paix allait me démoraliser*; ever 
since there have been no more articles to write for the Tribune I 
have been doing far too much loafing, for which there is every 
inducement up here. As to the militaria, Dana must provide an 
immediate answer to the following questions: 
1. How many volumes, roughly, will the whole amount to and 
how far does he propose to get in Vol. 1 or Vols. 1 and 2? 
2. Are the military articles to be confined primarily to defining 
technical terms, e.g. ARTILLERY, CASTRAMETATION, COLUMN, with historical 
notes and a brief synopsis of the individual branches of military 
science—thus e.g. artillery: 1. Definition. 2. History and present 
state.  3. Résumé of the branches of the modern science of artillery 
(gunnery, personnel, transport, use in the field and before 
fortresses, etc., etc.)? 
3. Or is the intention to have additional articles on military 
history, e.g. under the  HEAD  Austerlitz, Arbela, etc., etc., brief 
comptes rendus b of the actual battles, and under Alexander, Caesar, 
Carnot, etc., etc., military biographies together with particulars in 
each case of any epoch-making progress? 
Next, you must write to Steffen at once and ask him for the title 
or author of an encyclopaedia of military science, as short and 
complete as possible; one that has the most but also the shortest 
articles would be best, since all I want is to know at once what 
articles to do and to have the alphabetical material as complete 
and HANDY as possible. As soon as I have this I can start work on 
Letters A and B—perhaps even sooner, since I can do a lot of 
articles from Brockhaus c alone and a few more without it. 
The  PAY  is quite profitable, even at $2 per large page; a lot of 
the stuff will only have to be copied or translated and the longer 
articles won't involve a great deal of work. I shall take a look at 
one or two English encyclopaedias straight away to see what 
military articles they contain, but then concentrate on Brockhaus 
which, after all, not only provides a better basis but is also more 
complete and is evidently looked upon by Dana as a model. 
Should there be any philological sections for the taking, e.g. the 
Germanic languages, Middle High German, Old High German, 
etc., etc., literature (likewise in the Romance languages, especially 
Provençal), no harm would be done. Either the Jakob woman or 
Mr Gurowski will have taken on the Slav things; the former knows 
more about those languages than I do.

Which articles shall  you be  taking  on?  German philosophy,  at 
any rate—biographies  of modern English  and  French statesmen? 
Some financial pieces? Chartism? Communism? Socialism? Aristo­
tle—Epicurus—Code Napoleon—and  the  like. Themes certainly 
harder  to handle without  any  PARTY  TENDENCY  WHATEVER  than  the  good 
old military  stuff,  where needless  to say one  always sides with  the 
victor. 
Take  as many articles  as you can and set up an  office  by 
degrees.  Mr  Pieper  can toil away,  too;  he will do well enough  for 
biographical pieces  and  will,  at the  same time,  get  some plain 
wholesome information into  his  genius' noddle. Lupus might also 
be prepared  to do  something  in the early classical field;  je verrai! 3 
Even though  the  work won't  be very interesting (most  of it, at 
any rate),  I'm  immensely tickled  by the  whole thing since  it will 
mean  an  enormous LIFT  for  you.  I was  really hellish anxious this 
time about  how  the  Tribune business would turn  out,  particularly 
when Dana tried  to put you on  half-pay.  But  now  everything  is 
going  to be all  right again  and  even though there's  no immediate 
prospect  of payment,  it's  still a very secure berth  and one  need 
have no  qualms about doing  one  or two  letters  of the alphabet  in 
advance;  the  money will arrive  in its  own  good time. 
Haven't  you  heard anything from Olmsted about Putnam's'?  I 
should very much like  to have  the  article  on Bazancourt60 ; maybe 
I can do something with  it here through Acton. Apart from that 
there  may be a  possibility  of  doing something further with 
Putnam's—PROGRESS  IN THE ART OF WAR,  IMPROVEMENTS  IN ARTILLERY, SMALL 
ARMS,  etc., etc.,  SHIPS AGAINST STONE WALLS;  I'm willing to do anything so 
long as the  fellows undertake  to publish  it. Dana would certainly 
arrange  it to  make  you  less dependent  on the  Tribune.  By the way, 
get the  EDITOR  of Putnam's  to write  in person, cela vaut mieux. b 
You must also find  out  from Dana whether  the  articles should 
in general take  up  more  or less space than  e.g.  in Brockhaus,  and 
whether  the  whole  is intended  to be  bigger  or  smaller than 
Brockhaus. Then  we shall know what  we are  about. Also when they 
will pay—and  by  when  the  job  must  be completed.  It's as well to 
know  all this. 
In your place  I should offer  to do the  whole encyclopaedia 
alone;  we  could manage  it all  right.  At dll events, take whatever 
you can  get. If we have  100  to 200  pages  in each volume  it won't 
be too  much.  We can  easily supply that amount  of 'unalloyed'

Dear Fred, 
I shall write to Dana not later than tomorrow. For me, the thing 
has come as a godsend, as you can imagine. It has also reassured 
my wife, which is important in her present SITUATION. I shall write 
to Steffen straight away (the fellow has changed his lodgings 
without notifying me, but is still in Brighton). Pieper, as you will 
remember from one of my previous letters, 3 has been a 
schoolmaster in Bognor since Christmas,  AND  I SHALL  CERTAINLY  LEAVE 
HIM THERE.  He was becoming daily more vacuous, idle, useless and 
expensive. Under the iron rod of the parson in whose service he 
now is, he will again come to his senses. Moreover, the laddie left 
me just at a time when, because of my wife's condition, he thought 
himself indispensable and did not seem averse to the idea of my

pressing him to remain on more favourable terms. I  DID  NOTHING  OF 
THE SORT but merely expressed my satisfaction at his having at long 
last found a post. In the event, it transpired that his 'indispensabil-
ity' was merely a figment of his own imagination. My wife fulfils 
the function of secretary without all the  BOTHER  created by the 
noble youth. As tutor to the girls he was quite unsuitable. So both 
parties have benefited from the change and, if the fellow again 
becomes serviceable, as I am convinced he will, he'll be much 
fortified by the realisation that I do not need him in any way. 
Hence there can be no question of setting up an office in 
London. There is no one here who is any good. It's possible—and 
this I shall know within a day or two—that Dana has approached 
Freiligrath direct. Our Freiligrath is again MALCONTENT with his post 
though it enables him to earn £300 very comfortably with little or 
nothing to do. What he finds tedious is, for one thing, the 
moaning and groaning of the shareholders, who vent their 
displeasure on him, and, for another, his admittedly ambiguous 
position, which places a great deal of responsibility on him while 
allowing him barely a semblance of autonomy. That,  AT LEAST,  is the 
interpretation he himself puts on his FEELINGS. What in fact LURKS 
beneath all this is, or so it seems to me, a general distaste for 
RESPONSIBILITY. A clerical post which would relieve him of it, as at 
Hood's, is and always will be his dream. Then, too, he is 
tormented by the conflict between his renown as a poet and the 
rate of exchange. So far as I can gather from his occasional 
CONFESSIONS, all these Crédits mobiliers 45 are privily assailed by 
considerable MISGIVINGS. He was assured by an old hand on the 
Stock Exchange that never, in a practice of 40  YEARS'  STANDING, had 
he experienced a chronic state of crisis such as now prevails. I 
haven't yet got round to it, but some time I must really investigate 
the relationship between the rate of exchange and BULLION. The 
role played by money as such in determining the bank rate and 
the MONEY MARKET IS SOMETHING STRIKING AND QUITE ANTAGONISTIC TO ALL LAWS OF 
POLITICAL ECONOMY. Worthy of note are the 2 newly published 
volumes of Tooke's History of Prices.  A pity the old man's head-on 
collision with the CURRENCY PRINCIPLE chaps 132 should lead him to give 
such a one-sided TURN to all his disquisitions. 
I wrote to Dana as much as a fortnight ago asking for the 
return of your Bazancourt.60 
The Urquhartites—who have asked me to send them a detailed 
BILL—have  paid me £10 on account3; this was most welcome, since

I owed that much to baker and butcher alone. The girls are 
growing up very quickly and their education, too, is becoming 
expensive. At the LADIES SEMINARY they frequent, they are having 
PRIVATE LESSONS with an Italian, a Frenchman and a DRAWING MASTER. 
Now I have also got to find a chap for music. They learn 
extraordinarily fast. The youngest one—the BABYa—is an astonish­
ingly witty little thing and claims that SHE HAS GOT TWO BRAINS. 
For my own part I would much prefer to supply Dana with 
articles on, say, Ricardo, Sismondi, etc. That sort of thing does at 
least admit of objective treatment from the Yankee point of view. 
German philosophy is difficult to write about in English. However, 
I shall suggest various things to Dana and leave the choice to him. 
For the past six months I've been constantly having to call in the 
doctor for my wife. She is, indeed, very much run down. 
Apropos.  * Dr Freund has passed through the court of 
bankruptcy—assets £200, debts £3,000.* 
The Bright and Cobden party cannot help but thrive now that 
Faucher is the foreign editor of their London paper, The Morning 
Star. I'm now on speaking terms with the chap since I can't help 
encountering him sometimes at Edgar Bauer's. The man considers 
himself the finest fellow in the world. 'Bruno Bauer has lost his 
self-confidence. He feels that it is I, not he, who will conquer 
Prussia.' He is  A CURIOUS  FREETRADER  TOO,  who doesn't even know what 
the MIDDLE CLASSES are. Prussia is, and ought to be, ruled by 'the 
officer and the student', 'I bowl over any English meeting at which 
I speak', 'I have made history. It was I who drew up Cobden's 
Canton MOTION', 167 to cite only a few of his tropes. The chap's a 
veritable Munchausen of mendacity, a veritable Ancient Pistol6 of 
braggadocio, and once in 6 months it's amusing to listen to his 
boasting.

chichte published somewhere near Heidelberg, which is said to 
contain much that is new c?

DEAR  Frederick, 
The £5 received. 
Herewith a letter from Lassalle a which, when Lupus has seen it, 
you should return to me at the beginning of next week. What 
should I do about fellow? Reply or not reply? You'll be amused by 
the comical vanity of the laddie, who will do anything to become 
famous and, entirely without provocation, writes 75 sheets on 
Greek philosophy. 13 
I have written to Dana in exactly the terms you suggested. As 
regards your Bazancourt,60  I had already urged him to return it. 
Steffen doesn't know of any book such as you require; he himself 
appears to be engaged on an English translation of Rüstow's 
Cäsars Heerwesen. 
Pieper is on the point of falling back into his former foolishness. 
Has written me a 'genius's' letter. The enthusiasm—not the 
enthusiasm inspired in him by his new post, but that which he 
inspired in his new post cum attendant principal—appears AS 
ist ALLY to have waned. He wishes to go to Switzerland as a 
'courier', or else sever connections with his principal at mid­
summer and once again cut a dash in London with £20 in his 
pocket. When I next write I >hall pour cold water on the genius. 
If he is ever to become 'serviceable' again this young man must 
endure the parson's lash for some while yet. 
Have you read the Crédit mobilier'* 45 last report? It was in The 
TimesS Indicates a DECLINE. 
Pam  AS  REFORMER! He'll reform those boys WITH  A VENGEANCE. 
If you possibly can, write a military piece on Persia or China 
next week. My wife is drawing ever closer to the catastrophe and is 
finding her secretarial duties increasingly onerous. 
As regards your toothache, I would advise you to have recourse 
to the same means as I did after eighteen months' hesitation. Pull

What a pretty compilation it must be, likewise the thing that is 
going to 'set things alight' and about which he is so mysterious. 168 
We know, of course, that there is nothing to the fellow but it is 
difficult to find any positive reason for breaking with him, 
particularly as we have heard nothing further from the Düsseldorf 
workers. b From this letter he would appear to have ceased all 
intercourse with them, or rather they with him, since he finds 
nothing positive to say about how things are going with the 
workers in Germany. But whether he wouldn't again make use of 
a letter from you to regain some kudos in their eyes is another 
matter. In your place I should write to him—you can't very well 
do otherwise—but ask him outright how things stand with the 
workers' movement on the Rhine and especially in Düsseldorf, so

working your letter that he will keep his mouth shut about it and 
must either plus ou moins* declare himself or be deterred from 
corresponding with you. Lupus was much amused by the letter but 
our discussion on the subject was interrupted. I should, by the 
way, also make a point of asking him how he comes to slip your 
letters into the hands of the police. 
There is absolutely nothing to say about Persia; the campaign 
itself was rotten and the accounts are even more so. There was, of 
course, something to be said about China on the arrival of the last 
MAIL as there still is, but now, ten days after the last  MAIL,  it's too late 
to do anything. So I shall wait until the next  MAIL  arrives, when I 
shall at once set to work so that the articleb will reach you in time 
for Friday or the following Tuesday. As far as possible, then, 
make your arrangements accordingly. I think the MAIL arrives at 
the end of this week.

Dear Marx, 
As you will no doubt see from the enclosed article,1 it was 
written UNDER DIFFICULTIES. Each time I propose to do a Tribune

frame. On this occasion I'm sitting at home with linseed poultices

of a nasty abscess; I've been put on a frugal diet and forbidden 
beer, but by good fortune ordered to take a glass of wine. It's 
alleged that I've been eating too much roast  beef;  at all events I 
have had continual trouble with my face for the past month—first 
toothache, then a swollen cheek, then more toothache and now the 
whole thing has blossomed out into a furuncle, as little Heckscher 
calls it. In addition, I have to drink mineral water and—great fun, 
this—go out at 7 o'clock each morning. 
Everyone up here is an art lover just now and the talk is all of 
the pictures at the exhibition. The thing is proving plus ou moins 3 
a FAILURE, financially, at any rate. Admittedly there are some very 
fine pictures, though most of those by the better or very best 
artists are no more than SECOND-RATE. Among the finest is a 
magnificent portrait of Ariosto by Titian. The later German and 
French schools very poor, hardly represented at all. Three-
quarters consists of English trash. Best represented are the 
Spanish and Flemish and, after them, the Italians. S'il y a moyen? 
you and your wife ought to come up this summer and see the 
thing. It wouldn't do to write about it for the Tribune; and I 
wouldn't know where to begin—the Tribune can find the usual 
chit-chat in any paper. 
Lupus, as I believe I told you, has moved out and is again 
fighting the good fight with his LANDLADY. To make matters worse, 
his new LANDLADY was brought to bed a week after he moved in. 
Next door there's a chap who not only has a fiddle which he plays 
badly but also a French horn which he plays completely out of 
tune.  Hence the study of the pedagogic sciences is attended by 
enormous difficulties, so that the old chap is spending more time 
than usual at the Chatsworth. 
I shall be in London in a fortnight or 3 weeks' time, either 
during Whitsuntide or the week after.169

9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Engels, 
It may be some consolation to you to learn that for the past 3 
weeks right up to this very day, I have been submerged in pills 
and potions as a result of my old and, as I believe, hereditary  LIVER 
COMPLAINTS. Only by dint of the utmost exertions have I been able to 
supply the 'goods'—for the Tribune I mean—being otherwise 
QUITE  DISABLED.  In order that my time should not be entirely wasted 
I have, faute de mieux," been mastering the dansk sprog b and am 
presenüy applying myself to Af mit Livs og min Tids Historie, a 
colossal state haemorrhoid, af c (ex-minister) 0rsted. Opening 
oysters would be an altogether more amusing proposition. 
However, if the doctor's promises are anything to go by, I have 
prospects of becoming a human being again next week. Meanwhile 
I'm still as yellow as a quince, and vastly more crabbed. 
As regards your own tribulations, I am firmly convinced that 
they all stem from a hollow tooth which ought to come out and 
which, by a series of concatenations, underlies all the other 
unpleasant symptoms. Heckscher will deny this, OF COURSE. How­
ever, when you come down here—which I greatly look forward 
to—it can do you no harm at least to accompany me to a really 
first-rate dentist and get him to examine your teeth. My view is 
based on the fact that two years ago, when I was suffering from 
very much the same trouble, Dr Freund also declared I had been 
eating too much meat, yet a few months ago a courageous visit to 
the dentist at last uncovered the source of the trouble. Your 
intermittent toothache is, of course, the main factor in my 
argument. 
My wife expects to be confined at the end of the month, this 
time in not altogether agreeable CIRCUMSTANCES. It will be a long time 
now—another 3 weeks at very best—before I have accumulated 
enough to be able to draw on the Tribune. I tried to draw a bill on 
myself to cover the interim period, but failed with éclat. The

actual HOUSEHOLD debts  I can put off  paying,  but in the  case  of the 
rates this  is possible only  up to a  certain point,  and  besides,  the 
afore-mentioned circumstances call  for certain preparations which 
have  to be  paid  for on the  nail. 
As you  will have seen  in the  papers,  a second director  of the 
Crédit mobilier 45—the first  was  Place—viz.  the  BANKER Thurneys-
sen, has  decamped leaving massive debts  of ABOUT  30-40 million  frs. 
This splendid institution's latest report170 —that  of 28  April  ul­
timo"—reveals that, although  the  NET PROFIT still amounts  to 23%, 
it has  nevertheless fallen  by about  a half compared with  1855. 
According  to Mr  Péreire,  the fall is due 1. to the  ordre  in the 
Moniteur  of March  1856 by  which Bonaparte forbade  the  Crédit  to 
skim  the  cream  off the  excessive speculation then going  on in 
France;  2. to the  fact that,  by an  oversight, this 'ordre  de la  sagesse

open  to highly improper competition  in the  shape  of sociétés  de 
commandite  ; 3. to the  crisis during  the  last  3 months  of 1856. 
True,  the  Crédit sought  to exploit that crisis  to bring  off a few 
financial coups  de main,  but was  obstructed  in this 'patriotic' work 
by the  NARROW  SELFISHNESS  of the Banque de France and the syndicate 
of Paris BANKERS headed  by Rothschild;  4. Bonaparte  has  still not 
permitted them  to make  the  statutory  ISSUE  of 600  millions  in paper 
money  of their  own  devising. *That issue  is still looming  in the 
future.* Péreire seems  to be  exerting severe pressure  on 
Bonaparte. Should  the  latter shrink from giving  his authorisation, 
a MIDDLE COURSE would seem  to be  envisaged, namely  to turn  the 
Banque  de France into  the  instrument  of the  Crédit  by loftier 
means,  i. e. new  draft legislation. From this report  it further 
transpires that  the  Credit's business  is still vastly disproportionate 
to its capital  and  that  it has  used  the  capital loaned  by the  public 
exclusively  to further  its gambles  on the  Bourse.  As a  quasi-state 
institution  of Bonaparte's  on the one  hand,  the  Crédit mobilier 
declares that  it is  called upon  to maintain  the  prices  of FUNDS,  SHARES, 
BONDS,  in short,  of all  securities  on the  national Bourse,  by 
advancing  the  money borrowed from  the  public  to  COMPANIES  or 
INDIVIDUAL STOCK-JOBBERS  for their operations  on the  Bourse.  As a 
'private institution',  on the  other hand,  its main business consists  in 
speculating  on the  rises  and  falls  in the  stock-market. Péreire 
reconciles this contradiction  by something Moses Hess might well 
call 'social philosophy'. 171

I have omitted only one or two small items from your 
China-Persia article,3 and altered an expression here and there. I 
agree with the whole thing, only I don't think that the troops 
stationed in Persia will be sent to China so soon. The treaty 
expressly stipulates that they will not leave Persia until the Persians 
evacuate Herat.129 Pam won't spare them the hot season. That his 
instructions in this respect were again highly 'incomprehensible' 
would seem to follow from the fact that the Governor-General of 
India—Canning—tendered his resignation at the same time as the 
British general and the British admiralb committed suicide. 
Meanwhile, as announced in the Vienna newspapers, the main 
object has been attained. Persia has ceded two STRIPS OF LAND to

You might reconsider which articles one should offer to do, 
apart from the military. Philosophical stuff is, in fact, too badly 
paid and also difficult when it has TO BE DONE IN ENGLISH. Do you 
know if there happens to be any German or French book on the 
biographies of big industrialists? 
I'm equally puzzled as to how aesthetics is to be dealt with in 
1 PAGE, FUNDAMENTALLY, and on a Hegelian basis. 
Does Lupus feel inclined to take something on? 
Enclosed also a letter from Miquel. I do not, in fact, understand 
his theory of 'non-overproduction' and yet of 'lack of the

Dana must be out of his mind to stipulate 1 page for aesthetics. 
Nor has the chap any inkling of military matters. See list of articles 
overleaf,  occurring to me exclusively from Brockhaus and from

encyclopaedia it can't be final; how could anyone remember all the

there is an encyclopaedia of this kind by a hack of the most

desired thoroughness and brevity—over there by 1 July. Once

more on SHOW than on real substance, as is already evident from 
the $2 per page. 
Send Dana the list—as a provisional one—and point out that 
since it's impossible to work ON SPECULATION at this PAY, he must say 
what he wants. (It's precisely these patched together articles, being 
the easiest, that make the  PAY  acceptable.) A 2nd list of technical

I know nothing about Airey's (General) former career. You

English rendering of the book, he tends to be mistrustful. So far 
as the ancient world is concerned, I believe you could restrict 
yourself to a few generalities and simply say—in the article 
itselfa —that these themes are to be discussed under the headings 
'Greek Army' and 'Roman Army'.This will save time,during which it 
will be possible not only to procure Rüstow but also to send you a 
mass of other data, for I have now discovered at the Museum, b 
after prolonged searching, a complete list of sources on the 
military history of Antiquity. But at the moment speed is the main 
consideration. As you know, I took your advice and sent Dana a 
second list.177 So what excuse can I offer the man? I cannot plead 
illness, for if I do I shall have to interrupt my writing for the 
Tribune altogether and so reduce to nothing my already exiguous 
income. At a pinch Dana could have recourse to the man who 
already provides him with some of the military articles. In which 
case I would be elbowed out. To obviate this I shall have to write 
on Friday. But the difficulty is, what? 
As you will understand, nothing could be more distasteful to me 
than TO  PRESS  UPON  YOU while you are ill; nor, indeed, when you left 
here did I have any inkling that, in the state you are in, you would 
at once resume—and so  SERIOUSLY  at that—your work in the office. 
My own situation is such that everything depends on whether I 
can persuade little Bamberger to discount a bill on myself this

let loose. 
Freiligrath has written me a note from which I can see the

My wife has at last been brought to bed. The CHILD, however, not

partly because of the circumstances immediately attendant on it, 
which have branded themselves on my mind, and partly because

It was only this morning that your short note was brought to me

mail thought it more convenient to run his errand the next 
morning instead of the previous night. I was deeply affected by 
the contents of your letter, cryptic though it was, knowing how

not a Saturday.

painful it must be for you to write like that. You yourself may be 
taking the child's death stoically, but hardly your wife. How she is, 
you don't say, and hence I assume that all is well, but let me know 
for certain or I shan't have a moment's peace of mind. In this 
respect, your mysterious insinuations leave too much room for 
conjecture. Providing she herself is well it is perhaps better that it 
should now all be over. 
Today I can definitely promise you the manuscripts for Dana for 
Friday, i.e. the articles 'Alma', 'Abensberg', 'Adjutant', 'Ammuni­
tion' and more such small  stuff,  thus pretty well finishing off the 
whole of A (except 'Algeria' and 'Afghanistan') up to Ap and Aq. a 
I have got together the material for all this and should be able to 
work without interruption since, as a result of my breathing fresh 
air again, my illness has suddenly taken a turn for the better, 
which in all likelihood will finally put paid to the thing. This turn 
t-ook place last night and, since I've been ordered to take exercise 
in the open air outside the town, I shall not be going to the office 
until Thursday. As soon as I've finished these first articles, I'll 
tackle 'Army' (modern times, 1300 to 1850) and 'Artillery'; the 
first part of 'Army' I shall do last and, at the same time, let you 
have the list of B's. 'Artillery' will be ready to go off on Friday 
week, 'Army' as well perhaps. I may send you some of the shorter 
things tomorrow for Tuesday's post. 
A couple of days ago Lupus left for France and Switzerland. 
The French vice-consul here, a businessman, gave him a passport 
without further ado. On his return he will probably pay you a visit 
(in approx. 3 weeks). 
I dare not show my face at the office, but as soon as I can put in 
an appearance there I shall send you some more money.

sincerest sympathy. Love to the girls, and see that they keep in

less disquieting than your latest report on the state of your health. 
While delighted beyond measure that you should be improving, I 
am thoroughly alarmed to learn that you intend to return to the 
office—and to do so this very week. If nothing else, the whole 
course of your illness should have shown you that what you 
needed physically was to rest, recuperate and temporarily shake 
off the dust of the office. You must go to the seaside  AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. If, at this crucial moment, you should be so childish 
(pardon the expression) as to shut yourself up in the office again, 
you will suffer further relapses, and your resistance to the disease 
will at the same time be progressively impaired. Such relapses 
might ultimately lead to an infection of the lungs, in which case all 
attempts at a cure would be fruitless. Surely it is not your ambition 
to go down to posterity as one who sacrificed himself on the altar 
of Ermen & Engels' office? One would feel sorry for a person with 
your complaint if he were compelled by circumstances to chain 
himself anew to his business rather than restore his health. In 
your case, however, all that is needed is a vigorous decision to do 
what is medically necessary. Only consider how long the trouble 
has been dragging on already, and how many relapses you've had, 
and you will see how necessary it is  FOR  SOME  TIME  TO LET  MR  ERMEN  SHIFT 
FOR HIMSELF and to restore your health by breathing the sea air and 
enjoying relative leisure. I hope you will take the thing seriously 
and abandon your former mistaken system of alternating between 
medicine bottle and office. It would be unpardonable for you to 
persist in it. 
I can only relate verbally the circumstances that attended my 
wife's confinement and UNNERVED ME FOR SOME DAYS. I cannot write 
about such things. 
I have received your articles.3 MY  BEST  THANKS FOR THEM. 
The Indian revolt "8 has placed me in something of a quandary. 
As far as the Tribune is concerned, I am EXPECTED TO HAVE SOME 
SUPERIOR VIEW OF MILITARY AFFAIRS. If you can supply me with a few 
general axioms, I can easily combine them with the stuff I've 
already got together to make a readable article.b The situation of 
the insurgents in Delhi and the MOVES of the British army are the 
only points on which a few military generalities are needed. All 
the rest is MATTER OF FACT.

Dear Engels, 
Received the Cyclopaedia stuff To-DAY.b181 
If at all possible will you send me some money? On Monday I'm 
threatened with the BROKER on account of rates and LANDLORD. 
Besides this the total WANT OF CASH during the past fortnight has 
made it impossible to obtain the small COMFORTS the doctor has 
prescribed for my wife, whose RECOVERY is very slow—indeed, she 
would seem to be getting weaker every day. 
During this time I have been trying with conspicuous lack of 
success either to discount a bill or, as is quite customary in 
London, to raise a LOAN from a LOAN SOCIETY.182 The latter operation 
calls for two respectable guarantors and my attempts to find them 
have been a total failure. 
The money outstanding to me from the Tribune is so 
insignificant that I cannot think of drawing a bill on them for 
a at the bottom of my heart - b  Engels' articles 'Arbela', 'Arquebuse', 'Aspern', 'Airey' 
and 'Attack'.

another 2 weeks. It would have been more if, on the one hand, I 
hadn't been previously compelled to overdraw and, on the other, 
the troubles at home had not caused some loss of earnings. 
Nothing could be more distasteful to me than to burden you 
with my woes during your illness, but I'm so completely isolated 
that there is nothing else I can do. 
I trust that, at the seaside, you will soon recuperate. Don't forget

Dear Marx, 
Hefe I am at last at the seaside, where I have been since the 
evening of the day before yesterday. 183 It's 3 miles beyond New 
Brighton, but to the north of the Mersey. Unfortunately I arrived 
with a raging cold which has temporarily aggravated the glandular 
trouble, caused me a great deal of pain and spoilt my sleep. The 
worst of it is that for a day or two I shall be pretty well incapable 
of work, my daily report for Heckscher and other such 
unavoidable notes being as much as I can manage. In the evening 
I'm in such intense pain and so enervated that up till now I 
haven't even been able to read. That this damned thing should 
have had to happen now! Thus, since Friday evening or Saturday 
morning all my time has been wasted first by interruptions, then

by my illness. I'm one of your really miserable figures, stooped, 
lame and weak and—e.g. as at present—beside myself with pain. 
I had a hamper of wine sent to you from Manchester which will 
do your wife good: 6 bottles of Bordeaux, 3 of port, 3 of sherry. It 
should be there by now if the thing was properly attended to. Let me 
know the colour of the seals on the port and sherry so that I can keep 
a check on my wine merchant. Sherry ought to be yellow, port, I 
think, green. The Bordeaux bears the label Co. Destournel; I have 
just imported it. 
You will have the militaria" as soon as at all possible. 
Unfortunately I don't know whether the post reaches London in 
1 day; I shall only discover that from experience within the next 
few days. 
I hope that the sea air will soon make me fit again for the usual 
drudgery. As things are now, I'm bored to death.

BODILY welfare is as great as if I myself were ill—greater, 
perhaps. 
How are things in regard to 'coughing'? So far as I can judge 
from your letters, at least you're not much troubled with it. 
My doctor, who has treated a great many CASES such as yours, 
says that if a patient's condition does not permit of his bathing in 
the sea, he has successfully prescribed washing all over in heated 
(TEPID) sea water, the temperature being gradually reduced. 
Let me know whether you are taking iron. In cases such as 
yours,  as in many others, iron has proved stronger than the 
affliction.3

Dear Frederick, 
I am delighted to hear that the sea is doing you good, as was to 
be expected. As soon as you are fit enough to bathe, it will take 
effect even more quickly. 
The sea itself is, of course, the principal remedy. However, 
some medicaments ought to be taken internally, partly preventive, 
partly curative, so as to introduce into the blood those substances 
it lacks. As opposed to your assumptions in your letter to my 
wife 185 and basing myself on the most recent French, English and 
German literature, which I have been reading on the subject of 
your illness, I put forward the following, which you may submit to 
the scrutiny of any college of physicians or pharmacists: 
a Marx uses an inversion of the German saying 'Not bricht Eisen', literally 'Necessity 
breaks iron', making a pun on the word 'Not', which also means 'affliction'.

1. Whereas cod-liver oil requires 3 months to take effect, iron 
does so in 3 weeks. 
2. Cod-liver oil and iron are not mutually exclusive but 
complement each other during treatment. 
3. A temporary iron shortage in the blood is the primary 
characteristic of your disease. Besides bathing in the sea, you must 
take iron, even should there no longer be any outward sign of the 
disease. 
4. In your case the therapeutic element in cod-liver oil is iodine, 
since the oil's fattening properties are of no moment to you. 
Hence  IODIDE  OF IKON  combines both the elements you need, one of 
which you would obtain from cod-liver oil. At the same time, it 
would spare your stomach the extra ballast inevitable in the case of 
cod-liver oil. 
Voilà mes thèses,3  and I hope you will give them your serious 
consideration so that, once cured, you do not suffer subsequent 
relapses which are said to be EXCEEDINGLY disagreeable. 
As to the Delhi affair, it seems to me that the English ought to 
begin their retreat as soon as the RAINY SEASON HAS SET IN in real 
earnest. Being obliged for the present to hold the fort for you as 
the Tribunes military correspondent,13 I have taken it upon myself 
to put this forward.186 NB,  ON THE  SUPPOSITION that the REPORTS to date 
have been true. It's possible that I shall make an ass of  myself.  But 
in that case one can always get out of it with a little dialectic. I 
have,  of course, so worded my proposition as to be right either 
way. The persistent rumours about the fall of Delhi are being 
circulated throughout India by the government in Calcutta, no 
less, and are intended, as I see from the Indian papers, as the 
chief means of preventing unrest in the Madras and Bombay 
PRESIDENCIES. For your diversion I enclose herewith a plan of Delhi 
which,  however, you must let me have back.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Waterloo, 21 August 1857 
Dear Moor, 
You will have received the articles this morning.187 
I do, indeed, regard your theses as  OPEN  TO SOME  OBSERVATIONS.  That 
iron takes effect in 3 weeks as compared with 3 months for 
cod-liver oil is surely not to be taken literally. There could be 
absolutely no question of a disease of this kind being cured in 3 
weeks; on the contrary, I should say that, iron or no iron, cases 
have more often been known to take 3 years rather than 3 weeks 
to cure. 
That lack of iron in the blood is a primary characteristic of 
scrofula is certainly news to me. But whatever the literature on the 
subject, there is no doubt that, for some time past, it has become 
increasingly the fashion to reduce all diseases to lack of iron in the 
blood, a fashion which is already beginning to evoke a reaction; as 
to the disease of which, more than any  other,  this is known to be the 
primary characteristic—anaemia—some Frenchmen have latterly 
declared that iron has nothing at all to do with it. Exactly what the 
primary characteristic of scrofula is would seem to be still far from 
clear. 
That iodine is one amongst others of the principal elements 
responsible for the effect of cod-liver oil is not in doubt. But it is 

=====第188页=====
154 85. Engels to Marx. 21 August 1857 
by no means the only one. If one takes iodine in other forms one 
doesn't make such good progress. Besides, cod-liver oil contains 
chlorine and bromine, both of which have a direct or indirect 
effect on the disorder, and to what extent that effect is helped by 
the gall constituents and volatile fatty acids has not yet been 
established. All I know is that Norwegian cod-liver oil, which 
has the bitter taste of gall, has done me more good than 
the Newfoundland or English product, which does not taste 
of it. 
I took iron iodide all the time I was in Manchester (in between 
London169 and Waterloo183 ) along with cod-liver oil, and the 
inflammation grew steadily worse until finally it became chronic. 
Since I have been here I haven't taken any more iron iodide and 
Heckscher and I agreed long ago that either iron iodide or 
Quévenne's iron should be used in after-treatment. 
The fat in cod-liver oil is, pour le moment, 3 by no means useless 
ballast so far as I am concerned. Since regaining my strength, I 
am again accumulating fat. Needless to say, my diet may contain 
only a small proportion of ready-formed animal fats. Consequently 
I have to eat more starch flour and, in fact, I sometimes feel a 
positive craving for bread; I am eating twice as much meat, but 
four times as much bread as I usually do. The fat in cod-liver oil is 
an invaluable aid to this battening process, being taken in an 
exceedingly innocuous form and less of an irritant than animal fat 
or things cooked in fat. 
So you see, iron has never been completely out of our view and, 
even after I had been taking it for more than 3 weeks without any 
result (and it may, indeed, in the then circumstances, have made 
matters worse), we have nevertheless already reserved it for my 
after-treatment. Heckscher, to whom I spoke about iron last 
Sunday, was definitely against my taking it again at this juncture, 
in view of previous experience, and I must agree with him. Later, 
of course. I repeat that, despite the unanimity of the literature on 
the subject, I shall continue to entertain grave doubts about the 
reduction of all diseases to iron shortage until we know more than 
we now do about the condition and the normal level of iron in the 
blood. At all events, / had sufficient iron in my blood at the start 
of this business, as any of the doctors who saw me at the time can 
testify. I am perfectly willing to believe that people of definitely 
scrofular habit—pallor, transparent skin, etc.—may be suffering 
from a shortage of iron.

But admis? that this is the basic character, the INDISCRIMINATE and 
immediate use of iron is by no means indicated. It is extremely 
difficult to introduce iron into the blood otherwise than in the 
small amounts contained in ordinary food. Assuming, then, that 
the nature of my disease was the inability of the blood to assimilate 
the iron in food, how much less would it assimilate the iron in 
medicine? Sea air and sea bathing so invigorate the system as to 
restore the blood's ability in this respect. Thus it again assimilates 
the iron in meat and bread and, since I am eating more than 
formerly, concomitantly more iron. It is now, when this ability has 
been restored, that iron taken medicinally can help, although I 
believe that 9/i0 of it passes through the body unused and, even if 
one accepts the iron theory, the use of iron during every phase of 
the disease has been shown to be incorrect. On top of which one 
has to consider the wide variety of individual cases and constitu­
tions.  I myself,  for instance, appear to be particularly sensitive to 
all metals; even the external application of quicksilver to prevent 
the local spread of the inflammation took effect very rapidlyfin my 
case,  and it is quite possible that iron iodide, taken at a time when 
my blood was too disorganised to assimilate it, helped aggravate 
the inflammation. 
At all events, and even admitting the iron theory, I don't see 
how your theses materially confute the assumptions in my 
previous letter,0 in which I was, by the way, considering only the 
immediate use of iron, not in any specific form, and ruling out 
cod-liver oil. 
Today I bathed in the sea for the first time. It did me no end of 
good and made me ravenously hungry. For the time being I am to 
bathe only every other day. 
But now it's time for the post. Am working on 'Army'. 
Many regards to your wife and children.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Waterloo, 25 August 1857 
Dear Marx, 
My last letter was abruptly broken off because the post was 
leaving. I had meant to teil you about Lupus' adventures in 
France. He had neither time nor money enough to stop in 
London and therefore travelled straight through to Manchester, 
arriving with 2/- in his pocket. At Lille he was spotted by the 
French police and from then on they harried him. With his usual 
luck he arrived slap in the middle of the elections and a nice little 
assassination plot. He went to a small hotel near the Louvre, 
intending to visit Versailles. On this trip 2 mouchards" took 
possession of him, pushed their wav into his carriage both on the 
way there and on the way back, and never let him out of their 
sight. Back at the hotel two mouchards, one an Alsatian Jew, sat at 
his table while he ate supper, and passed remarks about him in 
German, French and broken English. *'That chap eats with much 
appetite and his head is not worth a farthing. The telegraphic 
despatch has just arrived',* b etc. Lupus kept mum—compelled, of 
course, by his bad political conscience, else he'd have been 
dragged off to clink and made to establish in the Préfecture what 
kind of a wolf he was—and drowned his anger in drink, after 
which he went up to his room and stationed himself by the 
window— au premier! 1 From there he caught sight of his Versailles 
friends in the gateway. The gang, growing ever larger, shouted 
loud remarks to him while their chief parleyed with the landlady. 
Subsequently the fellows took over the whole house and roistered 
and caroused half the night through. They occupied the rooms 
above and to the left and right of Lupus who, as you can imagine, 
was in a fine STEW — on top of which it was stiflingly hot. The 
fellows woke him early in the morning, banging on the walls on 
either side and dragging tables, beds, etc., etc., across the floor 
a police spies - b  In the original this sentence occurs twice: in English, as given here, 
and, prior to this, in the Alsatian dialect: 'Un was der Kerl noch mit einem Appetit 
fresse kann, un sei Kopp is doch nit e Pfennig wert.' - c on the first floor 

=====第191页=====

above so that he almost took leave of his senses. Presently Lupus 
plucked up sufficient courage to visit the w.c. The Jew and his 
mate were sitting on the stairs and in a loud voice the Jew said 
'The fellow's going for a shit now'. He ordered breakfast in his 
room and inquired when the train left for Strasbourg. One by one 
the fellows disappeared, for it was the day of the by-elections and 
they had achieved their aim of hounding Lupus out of Paris. Once 
again his Versailles friend was on the train and accompanied him 
in the same carriage as far as the fourth or fifth station, where 
another man took over. So conspicuously did the fellows push 
their way into the packed carriage that a French philistine 
jocularly remarked: 'Il y a donc un criminel parmi nous?' 3 In this 
way he was escorted to Lyons, the Versailles chap having 
reappeared on the steamer from Chalons on the Saône. At Lyons 
Lupus went to the first hotel but discovered that waiters and all 
were on the pay-roll, pointed him out and notified the chaps by 
telegraph when he was arriving. Whenever he left the room the 
waiter gave a whistle while the man in the office shouted out: 'Le 
voilà!' h, whereupon he was compelled to pass in review before the 
mouchard élite. They continued to harry him on the train to 
Seyssel as far as the point at which a line branches off in the 
direction of Plombières, where Mr Bonaparte happened to be. 
From then on, as soon as they saw that he was not going to 
Plombières, Lupus was free. On the return journey he wasn't 
harried at all. 
One can see what Mr Bonaparte has set in train with the Société 
du dix Décembre. 138 There is no mistaking the types, particularly 
as regards their roistering and the playful manner in which they 
make life a misery for suspects visiting Paris. Had Lupus not left, 
one of them would probably have started a brawl so as to have a 
pretext for taking him to the Préfecture. Just imagine how many 
chaps must be on the pay-roll if an entire cohort can be set on 
to Lupus, who is COMPARATIVELY unknown to them. And then 
the roping in of landlords, waiters, BOOTS, etc., etc., as collabo­
rators. 
I have just been bathing again which, while generally most 
invigorating and refreshing, seems at first rather to aggravate the 
inflammation. But that was only to be expected. On the whole I 
feel very well and the sores don't trouble me much. My old man is 
probably in Manchester by now; I shall know definitely tomorrow, 
a Is there a criminal among us then? - b There he is!

in which case I shall at once go to Manchester and then, within a 
few days, to a more bracing seaside resort, possibly the Isle of 
Man. So write to Manchester in the meantime. As soon as I'm 
completely recovered and no longer require such regular sea­
bathing I intend to take a sea trip, probably by STEAMER via Dublin 
to Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, where we could hold 
a council of war together. But that will depend on circum­
stances. 
'Army' is making progress; Antiquity is done, Middle Ages will 
be short and then modern times. However, Antiquity alone will 
run to 6 or 7 pages; I shall have to see what further deletions can 
be made. But we can't be bound too strictly by Mr Dana's conditions. 
It won't be possible to let you have the thing by Friday because of 
the disruption caused by my old man—but by Tuesday, I 
hope. Apropos, hasn't Dana said anything at all about the 
manuscripts or the list for B? Why, I wonder? It would certainly be 
curious if one were not to hear anything at all from him. Kindest

like yours. It's the only specific watering-place of the kind in

seeing it in your company—not much of it, to be sure—is 
remarkable chiefly for its stench. 
The situation in regard to Dana is a little awkward. During the 
acute phase of your illness I thought it ^inopportune to keep you 
informed of the details of the affair. It was quite some time ago 
that Dana sent me the enclosed B list (in which there are only two 
non-military articles, 'Blum' and 'Bourrienne'). On the same 
occasion he said that the sooner they got the contributions to the 
ensuing volumes, the better they would be pleased, while I, for my 
part, could always receive my fee immediately after sending in the 
articles. But what was I to do, at a time when the contributions to 
A could not be sent off, and any failure to respond to so urgent a 
request—on terms so favourable to myself—would inevitably have 
aroused suspicion? My only recourse was to refrain for a time 
from writing to New York, and then do so only at longish 
intervals—SAY,  EVERY  FORTNIGHT—so that later on it would still be 
open to me to tell them with some plausibility that domestic 
TROUBLES  and my own indisposition had made any sort of writing 
very difficult for me, as the paucity of my contributions to the 
papera also went to show. To send your B list to Dana in such 
circumstances would have been  QUITE  inexpedient and would have 
placed me in an even more invidious position. In the meantime I 
had also learned that Major Ripley b had become co-editor of the 
Tribune, so that in case of need Dana had a pis aller c for the 
Cyclopaedia. 
WELL,  on 24 July I despatched your first pieces. 181 August was 
nearly upon us and your condition seemed to have deteriorated 
again. On 11 August another package arrived from you. d Instinct 
warned me that a letter from New York was now imminent and 
would place me in something of a quandary since your illness 
meant that it was  OUT  OF ITHE]  QUESTION  to speed up the work. So in 
order to leave a loophole for  myself,  I sent the package off to 
Dana together with a letter 189 in which I 1. informed him that the 
BULK of the contributions had gone off on 7 August (to make him 
think the manuscript had gone astray), at the same time telling him 
that the tardiness and delay were due to an indisposition which had 
not yet quite  SUBSIDED.  I took this step because it covered any 
eventuality. Thus, when Dana protests (probably at the begin­
ning of September) the manuscript for A either will or will 
not be ready. In the first case, he either will or will not still be

the latter, the blame will be seen to attach to the post office. If 
not READY at all, then all the more need for him to be hood­

On 17 August" I received the enclosed letter from Dana. 
As regards B, there can now be no question of adding to the

Otherwise we'll have to abandon the whole thing.

I finally arrived today at my new lodgings 183 in the middle of a

very aristocratic little spot, though lodgings are not as dear as in 
Waterloo. At the end of the week I shall doubtless know what the 
situation is as regards food. However the hotels, etc., etc., are 
scandalously expensive. 
In Portsmouth one might almost be at home in Germany. One is 
barely aware of the  NAVY  in the town, which, by contrast, is lorded 
over by the subaltern—the false dignity, the affectation of reserve 
and the strangulated English that go to make up your OFFICER AND 
GENTLEMAN. Moreover, almost everyone goes around in uniform. I 
watched the 47th Regiment drilling, all of them bemedalled 
veterans of the Crimea,3 newly arrived from the Mediterranean. 
The more simple evolutions were passable but the intricate 'model' 
manoeuvres, of which there are so many in the English manual, 
were carried out very shakily. Square formation from marching in 
open order, each file proceeding diagonally, thus /////, was botched 
completely and the most hellish confusion arose. By contrast the 
march past in line, with the entire battalion deployed, was very 
well done. The commanding officer was very calm but as with us 
there was cursing and swearing within the companies. All 
movements were executed at the same gait as ours, somewhat 
longer paces perhaps, but performed rapidly though with great 
nonchalance on the part of individual men. A Prussian lieutenant's 
comment would be: The chaps lack drill. Still very poor at 
the double. Shoot as though half-asleep. Conclusion: Manual 
rotten, men better than manual. So far little learnt from the 
French in the Crimea. The moderri stuff either not introduced at 
all or else rottenly done. 
I shall send you 'Army' as soon as it is finished. Warmest 
regards to your wife and children.

ENGELS TO MARX 190 
IN LONDON 
[Ryde,] 10 September [1857,] Thursday 
Dear Marx, 
Herewith 'Bennigsen' and 'Barclay'." I am taking a closer look at 
the Napoleonic generals, who will follow tomorrow or the day 
after. 'Army' ready shortly. 
Your 
F. E. 
All that I know about Bennigsen is that in 1807, at the 
beginning of the campaign under Kamenski, he commanded the 
First Army (there were 2 of them, the 2nd under Buxhövden); on 
26 December 1806, he was attacked by Lannes near Pultusk and, 
having the superiority in numbers, he held out (because Napoleon 
attacked the other army with the main force) and then, assuming 
himself to be the victor, wanted to attack in strength. He was soon 
given the supreme command and attacked Napoleon's winter 
quarters at the end of January 1807; was soon pressed hard and 
by mere chance evaded the trap which Napoleon had set for him; 
he fought at Eylau on 7 and 8 February. On the 7th Napoleon 
captured Eylau (Barclay de Tolly, who directed the defence, 
distinguishing himself), and on the 8th the main engagement took 
place, Bennigsen being obliged to give battle in order to evade hot 
pursuit by Napoleon, and being saved from total defeat only by 
the toughness of his troops, the arrival of the Prussians under 
Lestock and the slowness with which Napoleon's individual corps 
appeared on the battlefield. In the spring Bennigsen entrenched 
himself at Heilsberg, because he was the weaker; he did not 
attack Napoleon while part of the French army was absent, 
engaged in the siege of Danzig 192; but when Danzig had fallen and 
the French army was united, he attacked (!), let himself be held up 
by Napoleon's vanguard, which had only '/a the strength he had, 
and then be manoeuvred back into his entrenched camp by 
Napoleon. This Napoleon attacked without success on 10 [June] 
a The material that follows was used by Marx and Engels in their articles 'Bennigsen' 
and 'Barclay de Tolly'.

with only 2 corps and several battalions of the Guard, but on the 
very next day he forced Bennigsen out of his camp and caused 
him to beat a hasty retreat; however, Bennigsen suddenly went 
over to the offensive without waiting for a corps of 28,000 men, 
which was already in Tilsit, occupied Friedland and established 
himself there, with his back to the river and therefore with only one 
line of retreat, the Friedland bridge (always wrong to give battle 
before a defile). Instead of advancing rapidly before Napoleon 
could concentrate his corps, he let himself be held up for 5-6 
hours by Lannes and Mortier ('coupe-gorge dans lequel Bennigsen 
s'était engagé', 3 says Jomini of this position) until at about 5 
o'clock b Napoleon was ready and gave the order for the attack. 
The Russians were thrown back to the river, Friedland was 
captured, the bridge having been destroyed by the Russians 
themselves while their whole right wing was still on the other side 
and escaped only over fords and with the loss of its artillery. 
20,000 men lost. Bennigsen 
'avait fait fautes sur fautes dans cette journée ... il y eut dans sa conduite un 
mélange d'imprudence téméraire et d'irrésolution'. c 
In 1812 he followed Russian headquarters around inveighing 
against Barclay in order to get his place, intriguing against him 
until Alexander relieved Bennigsen of his post. In 1813 he was 
ordered to lead the reserve army out of Russia into Bohemia, and 
when it arrived it was disbanded and Bennigsen disappeared. 
Barclay de Tolly commanded a brigade at Eylau, etc. (see 
above);  in 1812 commanded the First West Army and was War 
Minister; after Alexander's departure until Kutuzov's arrival was 
General-in-Chief, directed the retreat of the Russian army skilfully 
and had the great merit of resisting the clamourous demands of 
the Russians and of the whole headquarters to give battle. When 
he had to fight, as at Smolensk, he took up such a position that hë 
could not be involved in a decisive battle, 193 and when this could 
no longer be avoided—shortly before Moscow—he selected a 
position by Gzhatsk which was almost impregnable from the front 
and could be bypassed only by a very big detour. The army had 
already occupied this position when Kutuzov arrived, and natural­
ly he would not agree to it because it was not he who had chosen 
it, and so the Russians had to fight in the unfavourable position at 
a 'A robbers' den into which Bennigsen has ventured' (A. H. Jomini, Vie politique et 
militaire de Napoléon, t. 2, p. 414). - b 14 June 1807 - c 'committed mistake after 
mistake on that day ... his conduct was a mixture of rash imprudence and irresolution' 
(A. H. Jomini, op. cit., t. 2, p. 421).

Borodino.194  In 1813 and 1814 Barclay commanded not an 
independent corps, but all the Russians in the Allied Army under 
Schwarzenberg, and as these were in separate corps and often split 
up, it was an administrative and diplomatic rather than a 
combatant position, 195 and he proved  himself,  as earlier, to be one of 
the better of the average generals—having bon sens' 1 and staying 
power—and at any rate the best of the older generals that the 
Russians had.

IN LONDON 
[Ryde, 11 or 12 September 1857] 
[...] Berthier was a mere CLERK without an idea in his head, but 
frightfully zealous in the service and punctilious; when Napoleon 
sent him to Bavaria in 1809 to organise the troops before his own 
arrival, his ordres et contreordres b split the army into three. Half of it 
was with Davout at Regensburg, the remainder with Masséna at 
Augsburg, and the Bavarians in between at Abensberg, so that a 
rapid advance by Archduke Charles would have enabled him to 
defeat the various corps one by one. It was only Napoleon's arrival 
and the slowness of the Austrians that saved the French. 
In 1813 Bernadotte was not a general at all but a diplomat. He 
prevented the generals under him from attacking and when, in 
contravention of this order, Bülow won his two victories at 
Grossbeeren and Dennewitz, 197 Bernadotte stopped the pursuit. 
He was in constant touch with the French. When Blücher marched 
to the Elbe to join up with him and to force him at last to act, he 
continued to prevaricate until Sir Ch. Stewart (the English 
commissary in his camp) told him that if he didn't march 
immediately, he wouldn't pay out another penny. This helped— 
a common sense - b  An allusion to Napoleon's words 'ordre, contreordre, désordre'.

nevertheless it was purely honoris causa that the Swedes appeared 
in the firing-line at Leipzig,198 and during the whole campaign 
they lost less than 200 men in battle.— In 1798 Bernadotte was 
French ambassador in Vienna; to celebrate the anniversary of a 
victory over the Austrians he hoisted the tricolor, whereupon the 
populace stormed his residence and burned the flag. He left, but 
Napoleon decided against him and persuaded the Directory '"  TO

que général en  chef' c [p. 60]. 
'Marmont, jadis mon aide de camp et officier d'artillerie' [pp. 60-61]. 
'Davout, qui avait reçu une bonne éducation, avait la tête fortement organisée et 
des idées de guerre très justes. Ses manières rudes et un caractère à la fois 
soupçonneux et dur lui ont fait beaucoup d'ennemis, et dans les graves 
circonstances où il  s'est  trouvé, l'esprit de parti  s'est  déchaîné contre lui avec une 
grande injustice. Sévère, mais juste envers ses subordonnés, mieux qu'aucun autre 
il sut maintenir la discipline parmi ses soldats; aucun de mes maréchaux n'exigeait 
plus de ses subordonnés, et aucun ne les fit servir avec tant d'exactitude' [p. 61'].

fait preuve de talents supérieurs' [p. 61]. 
'Lannes; couvert de gloire et de blessures, ce brave manquait de principes faits 
sur la guerre; mais il y suppléait par un jugement admirable et sur le champ de 
bataille il ne le cédait à aucun de ses collègues' [p. 61]. 
'Ney. Lannes fut peut être aussi brillant que lui dans maintes attaques; mais la 
force d'âme que Ney déploya dans le grand désastre de 1812 où il commanda 
successivement tous les corps de l'armée, lui assigne le premier rang parmi les 
braves de tous les jours. De même que plusieurs de ses collègues il n'entendait point la 
guerre en grand sur la cartel; mais sur le terrain, rien n'égalait son assurance, son 
coup d'oeil et son aplomb' [p. 62]. 
'Murât, qui avait dû à sa bonne mine, à son courage et à son activité l'honneur 
d'être mon aide de camp et mon beau-frère, n'a jamais été à la hauteur de la réputation 
colossale  que je lui avais faite. Du reste, il avait de l'esprit naturel, un courage brillant 
et une grande activité' [p. 63],

d'un grand caractère, d'un courage éprouvé et d'un coup d'oeil qui inspirait les

place distinguée parmi les capitaines modernes. Cependant il faut avouer qu'il 
brillait plus dans les combats que dans le conseil' [p. 63].

'Mortier, moins brillant, était pourtant plus solide, son calme et son sang-froid, 
passés en proverbe parmi les soldats, lui avaient valu plus d'un succès et il était du 
nombre de ceux qui pouvaient conduire un corps sous ma direction' [p. 64]. 
'Bessières avait fait ses preuves près de moi à l'armée d'Italie où il commandait 
mes guides à cheval. Il n'avait pour lui qu'un grand esprit d'ordre et une valeur 
reconnue. Il était méthodique et d'une timidité exessive dans le conseil' [p. 64]. 
'Lefebvre, duc de Dantzic, était un vrai grenadier. Enfant de la nature, il ne 
devait rien qu'à son esprit naturel, à une grande bravoure, et à un caractère simple 
et naif.  Il savait se faire aimer du soldat et le mener droit à une position; c'était 
tout son mérite' [p. 64]. 
'Jourdan avait dû à la fortune une grande partie de sa réputation. Bon 
administrateur, laborieux, homme d'ordre et intègre. Et ayant de l'instruction, il 
eût été fort bon chef d'état major d'une grande armée sous un chef qui l'eut bien 
dirigé' [p. 64]. 
'Macdonald ... avait fort mal manoeuvré à la Trebbia'  [...]»  [p. 65]. 
Berthier is not mentioned in this collection. 
Apropos: what about your material on Bern? Of him it must be 
said that he excelled in command of smaller corps of 5-10,000 
men and could inspire younger troops with self-assurance by good 
a 'Bernadotte ... a man of refinement, of brilliant appearance; the plans of operations 
which he drew up in his capacity as War Minister proved him to be better as a 
subaltern than as a general-in-chief (p. 60). 
'Marmont, formerly my ADC and artillery officer' (pp. 60-61). 
'Davout, who had a good education, possessed a well-organised brain and very 
correct ideas about war. His rough ways and a disposition at once suspicious and harsh 
earned him many enemies, and in the grave circumstances in which he found himself 
the spirit of prejudice broke loose against him with great injustice. Severe but fair 
towards his subordinates, he knew better than anyone else how to maintain discipline 
among his men; not one of my marshals demanded so much of his subordinates, and 
not one of them induced them to serve with such punctiliousness' (p. 61). 
'Soult, with his manly build, his broad, hard-working, active and untiring mind, had 
demonstrated superior talents' (p. 61). 
'Lannes; covered with glory and with wounds, this brave man lacked set principles 
concerning war; but he made up for this with his admirable judgment, and on the 
battlefield he was second to none of his colleagues' (p. 61). 
'Ney. Lannes was perhaps as brilliant as he in many an attack; but the fortitude 
which Ney displayed in the great disaster of 1812, when he commanded all the corps 
of the army in succession, ranks him first among the brave men of all times. Like many 
of his  colleagues,  he understood nothing about war on a large scale on the map; but on the 
ground his assurance, his sharpsightedness and his poise were unequalled' (p. 62). 
'Murat, who was indebted to his good looks, his courage and his activity for the 
honour of being my ADC and my brother-in-law, never lived up  to the colossal  reputation 
which I had made for him. For the rest, he had a natural wit, brilliant courage and great 
energy' (p. 63). 
' Masséna received from nature all that goes to make an excellent soldier, endowed 
with a splendid character, a courage which stood the test and a sharpsightedness 
which inspired the most prompt and most felicitous decisions; he cannot be denied a 
distinguished place among the captains of our time. But it must be admitted that he 
shone more in battle than at the council table' (p. 63).

use of natural cover and [artillery] support; that he particularly 
distinguished himself in the small [mountain] warfare into which 
the whole of the first Transylvanian campaign200 developed, but 
that he had A CONSIDERABLE DASH OF THE PARTISAN, which made him 
incapable of commanding bigger armies. In the second Transylva­
nian campaign, when masses of Russians invaded, he operated 
again with rash raids after the manner of partisans without any 
consideration for the relative strength of the opposing forces and 
thus lost not only Transylvania but the whole of his army too. His 
march into the Banat (before the second Transylvanian cam­
paign) achieved nothing201 ; he seems to have been unable to cope 
with the greater masses he was in command of. Praise is due to his 
great fortitude and his art of arousing the men's confidence in his 
otherwise unmartial-looking person. He could quickly achieve 
superficial organisation and discipline, but was satisfied at that. He 
neglected to build up a body of picked troops, for which the first 
Transylvanian campaign provided time enough and which was the 
greatest necessity, and hence all the outward organisation—and 
relative discipline—disappeared at the first setback. His bigger 
campaign plans all bear a heavy empreinte 3 of partisan warfare; the 
basic features are mostly correct but presuppose far different 
means from those available, and even supposing that they were 
available they could be put to better use. E.g. his plan to abandon 
Hungary and break through to Italy via Trieste. Had the means 
for this been at his disposal and capable of being concentrated, the 
forces would thus have been provided with which to defeat Haynau, 
'Brune was not without a certain merit, but all considered, he was a tribune general 
rather than a formidable soldier' (p. 64). 
'Mortier, less brilliant, was however more reliable; his calm and sangfroid,which 
became proverbial among his soldiers, won him success more than once, and he was 
one of those who could lead a corps under my direction' (p. 64). 
'Bessières had proved his worth with me in the army of Italy, in which he 
commanded my mounted guides. All he had to distinguish him was a great spirit of 
order and a recognised valour. He was methodical and excessively timid at the council 
table' (p. 64). 
'Lefebvre, Duke of Danzig, was a true grenadier. A child of nature, he owed 
everything to his natural wit, to his great bravery and his straightforward, naive 
character. He knew how to win the soldiers' love and lead them straight into action; 
that was where his merit lay' (p. 64). 
'Jourdan owed much of his reputation to fortune. A good administrator, 
hard-working, a man of order and integrity. And had he had training, he would have 
made a very good chief of staff of a great army under a commander who directed him 
well' (p. 64). 
'Macdonald ... manoeuvred very badly at La Trebbia' (p. 65).

whereupon the Russians, instead of concentrating, would have been 
obliged to split up in order to hold what they had captured, and 
hence could have been defeated piecemeal. It must not be 
forgotten, however, that in an insurrectionary war these partisan 
methods are partially justified precisely because of the uncertainty 
concerning the means really available; the bigger the scale of the 
war, however, the less appropriate they become.3

French generals who are next on my list. As to Bern's Polish DEEDS 
have found the following3: 
Distinguished himself at the battle of Iganin, when he engaged 40 Russian 
heavy calibre cannon with 12 light and 4 heavy guns, and subsequently at the battle 
of Ostrolenka.203  Here he galloped his battery up to the line of Russian 
skirmishers, subjected the detachments which had crossed the Narev to devastating 
fire, withstood a hail of shot from 80 guns, and forced the enemy to withdraw. 
After this engagement promoted to colonel, shortly afterwards to command of the 
entire artillery and, when the Polish forces were concentrating at Warsaw, to 
general. During 5 and 6 September Bern committed all his guns to battle, siting his 
field pieces between the separate defensive works of the outer line. On the 6th, he 
advanced with 40 guns until he was just below Wola, already in Russian hands, but, 
having neither infantry nor cavalry in support, was compelled to retire. When the 
Polish army fell back on Praga during the night of the 7th, he occupied the bridge 
with 40 guns. On the morning of the 8th, however, he was informed of the 
agreement made with the Russians and of Malachowski's order to proceed with the 
artillery to Modlin. Cf. his memoir, Allgemeine Augsburger Zeitung, 1831, in which 
he discusses recent developments and attacks Krukowiecki.' b 
I don't trust the above authority an inch and would therefore 
ask you to investigate and to do me a short, amended version of 
the passage concerned, if possible putting it straight into English.

the present writers under Boustrapa40 are his unqualified oppo­
nents.  The main points at issue upon which I should appreciate 
information from you are: 
1. His part in the battle of Austerlitz204 as a consequence of the 
manoeuvres he executed before the same. 
2. His conduct at the batde of Jena46 ; and before the batüe of 
Eylau. 191 
3. His conduct at the battle of Wagram.206 
As regards his embassy in Vienna, things were not quite as you 
present them." It has been shown (by inter alia Schlosser, Zur 
Beurtheilung Napoleons) that the Bonapartist journals in Paris 
denounced Bernadotte as a royalist because he did not hang out 
the French flag. They drove him into taking the step which 
Bonaparte subsequently disavowed. 
All in all, Bonaparte sensed that Bernadotte was the 'statesman' 
amongst his generals and one intent on pursuing his 'own plans'. 
He, and more notably his brothers, by their base and petty 
intrigues against Bernadotte, gave him greater prominence than 
he could otherwise have laid claim to. 
Napoleon was, in general, beastly to anyone he suspected of 
'self-seeking'.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Ryde, Friday, 18 September 1857 
Dear Marx, 
Your letter arrived yesterday afternoon, too late for me to get 
anything done for B. Moreover, I was in Portsmouth when the 
letter got here, so that more time was lost, otherwise I'd have been 
able to translate the Bern thing for you.a  You seem to be having 
bad weather; here it's persistently fine, only too hot; last week 
there was an occasional heavy shower, but apart from that it was 
fine and warm all the time. The climate here is really marvellous 
and the vegetation, except for things needing very hot sunshine, is 
so southern one might almost be in Naples. The hedges are laurel. 
I'm improving rapidly, the actual complaint is quite over, there's 
no longer a sign of inflamed glands and my one concern now is 
the process—admittedly a lengthy one—of patching up, getting 
the sores to heal, and putting on flesh and fat. Bathing does me a 
great deal of good and I find I can swim like a fish again—proof 
of how well my treatment is going. I've been to see Pieper at 
Bognor; quite a nice little place, but not a patch on Ryde; I 
wonder how long he'll stay there—he's lucky, but for that very 
reason his 'yeenius' is again reasserting  itself;  he attributes his 
luck to personal merit and already half fancies himself king of 
Bognor. He's coming over on Sunday and Steffen too, perhaps. I 
am going to Brighton SOMETIME NEXT WEEK and sailing from there to 
Jersey; Schramm is also going there, 188 or so he writes. Why don't 
you slip down to Brighton and, if it can be fitted in with the work, 
come to Jersey too? Anyhow the sea-trip would do you good. 
What do you think? I shall stay here until Tuesday at any rate, 
perhaps even longer: je verrai} 1 
As to Bern, all I should say is this: 
*At the battle of Iganin, where he commanded the artillery, he 
was noticed for the skill and perseverance with which he fought it 
against the superior Russian batteries. At Ostrolenka, he again 
commanded the artillery in this capacity0; when the Polish army

had been finally repulsed in its attacks against the Russians who 
had passed the Narev, he covered the retreat by a bold advance 
with the whole of his guns.203 He was now created colonel, soon 
after general and called to the command in chief of the whole 
Polish artillery. When the Russians assaulted the entrenchments of 
Warsaw and took Wola, Bern advanced with forty guns against 
this, the principal work of the whole line, but the superior force 
of Russian artillery opposed to him prevented the Polish 
infantry from returning to the assault and compelled Bern to 
retire.*3 
The other matters are quite trivial. I have no material to hand 
about Iganin; it was a quite unimportant engagement, the defence 
of a dam, rendered fruitless as usual by an outflanking move­
ment—the 40 cannon of heavy calibre are certainly a figment, 
likewise the Russian retreat at Ostrolenka, which can only have 
referred to tirailleursh  and soutiens, 11 or a couple of exposed 
battalions. What I have said above puts the thing in the most 
favourable light, for Diebitsch forbade any pursuit. 
Many thanks for the thing on bridges.d  Wholly adequate. 
On Sunday or Monday I shall be sending you 'Battle', 'Battery' 
and any other B's I have finished, and then get on smartly 
with the remainder. I shall also let you have something on 
Blücher one of these days, as soon as I've read through  Miif-
fling. e 
Which French generals and which of their exploits do you wish 
me to investigate more particularly? Allow me as much time as 
possible since I can't work very well for more than 2 hours at a 
stretch.

Dear Engels, 
Nothing could please me more than to hear that your health is 
progressing. 
Last Friday, a letter arrived from Dana, cool and curt. I replied 
that I would complain to the POST OFFICE at once. Further, having 
'Algeria' and 'Ammunition' to hand, I sent them  off 207 with the 
comment that I had copies of them; also that I had 'Army' in the 
original, and would send it off immediately a fresh copy had been 
made (I did this because in recent letters you have several times 
mentioned that 'Army' was almost finished); also, that 'Artillery' 
would for the most part come under the HISTORY  OF CANNON  and that 
I no longer had the manuscript. The only A's now remaining—and 
these I would send on the off-chance, although it is probably by 
now too late—were, all told, 'Army', 'Armada' and 'Ayacucho'. I 
mentioned the last 2 because you can keep them quite short, while 
the material I have sent you will provide some original stuff on 
the Armada and Ayacucho (about Espartero). That's how matters 
stand. 
Tomorrow I shall send off 3 more biographies.* 
My circumstances won't permit me to come to Brighton, still less 
accompany you to Jersey. 
On closer examination I find that all I want from you on the 
generals under B is an answer to my question about Bernadotte 
together with the essentials concerning Blücher, Bugeaud, Bosquet 
(in the Crimean War). I have enough on the other Frenchmen. 
Finally, Sir G. Brown, about whom I know nothing. Not much 
needed on the man. 
I have sent Dana your B and C lists. 
Salut.

Ryde, 21 September 1857 
Dear Marx, 
Steffen and Pieper have been here in company with a friend of 
Pieper's and, as the two last have only just left, I've hardly any 
time before the post goes to take a look at the enclosed article 3 or 
write to you about 'Bernadotte'. 
Austerlitz.204 He was sent to Iglaub  by Napoleon in order to keep 
an eye on the Archduke Ferdinand in Bohemia. Having received 
in good time Napoleon's order to come to Brünn, c which he did, 
he was placed with his corps between Soult and Lannes (in the 
centre) where he helped repulse the outflanking movement of 
the allied right wing. I don't recall any particularly important 
action of Bernadotte's on this occasion, nor can I find anything in 
Jomini. d 
Jena? ob Here it is a fact that Bernadotte did indeed receive 
orders from Napoleon to march from Naumburg to Dornburg 
while Davout, who was also in Naumburg, was to march to 
Apolda. The order received by Davout stated that, if Bernadotte 
had already joined him, they might both march to Apolda 
together. Davout was in favour of the latter, having reconnoitred 
the Prussian lines of advance in person and satisfied himself that 
Bernadotte wouldn't meet the enemy in the Dornburg direction. 
He even offered to place himself under Bernadotte's command. The 
latter, however, insisted that, in the orders he had received, the 
passage relating to Apolda did not appear, and he moved off. The 
result was that on the 14th he spent the whole day marching 
round without meeting the enemy, while Davout was compelled to 
fight alone at Auerstedt. Had Bernadotte been there, or had he 
simply marched towards the thunder of the cannon on the 14th, 
this au fond e indecisive victory could have been every bit as 
decisive as the one at Jena. Only because of the meeting of the 
Auerstedt Prussian army with the fugitives from Jena and also

because of the strategic preparations Napoleon had made for the 
battle, did the affair prove decisive after all in its consequences. 
Why Bernadotte did this nobody has ever found out. Jomini 
calls it une exactitude trop scrupuleuse? Probably Bernadotte was 
glad to discredit Napoleon by sticking rigidly to his instructions, 
for in this instance the latter had undoubtedly acted on false 
premises. 
Eylau.191 When Bennigsen moved off to engage Ney's troops, 
who had ventured too far forward, Bernadotte being to their left 
rear, Napoleon laid a trap for him. Ney withdrew to the south and 
Bernadotte to the south-west with orders to lure Bennigsen 
towards the Vistula, while Napoleon marched north from Poland 
towards Bennigsen's communications. An orderly officer carrying 
written orders for Bernadotte was captured by the Cossacks and in 
this way Bennigsen learnt of the impending danger, which he just 
managed to elude. Bernadotte, on the other hand, remained 
without instructions as a result of the same incident and 
accordingly stayed to the rear of the line. I don't see that there is 
anything to reproach him with on this score. 
Wagram.206 On the first day of the battle 
'Eugèneb  déboucha près de Wagram; mais, donnant ici au milieu des réserves 
ennemies, et n'étant pas soutenu par Bernadotte qui ne s'était engagé ni assez tôt ni 
assez franchement, il fut attaqué de front et en flanc, et ramené vertement jusqu'à 
ma garde.' c 
I can discover nothing of special moment about Bernadotte on 
the 2nd day of the battle. 
At all events Monsieur Bernadotte was not a great general; 
nowhere did he distinguish himself and even as a politician there 
was much of the Gascon in him—what an idea, wanting to become 
Emperor after Napoleon!d 
I have absolutely nothing to say about Bessières save that for the 
most part he was in command of the Guard, in particular the 
cavalry, a post that hardly demanded a superfluity of intelligence. 
He was brave, voilà tout. e 
I intend to finish B this week if possible, or at any rate break 
a undue punctiliousness (A. H. Jomini, op. cit., p. 290) - b Beauharnais - c  'Eugène 
debouched near Wagram, but having arrived in the midst of the enemy reserves and 
not being supported by Bernadotte, who had not joined batde either early enough or 
resolutely enough, he was attacked on his front and flanks and was smartly driven 
back as far as my Guard' (A. H. Jomini, op. cit., t. 3, p. 266. Here Jomini quotes 
Napoleon). - d Engels' notes on Bernadotte were used by Marx in his article

What's the position as regards your trip? 
Havelock seems to be the best chap in India, and it is a really 
tremendous feat to have marched 126 miles in a week in that 
climate, not to mention fighting 5 or 6 engagements. That it 
would end in a general outbreak of cholera might have been 
predicted. 
I hardly see The Times at all here, otherwise I could write to 
you at greater length about India, but getting hold of newspapers 
to read here is altogether too difficult.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Ryde, 22 September 1857 
Dear Marx, 
Here is a bit more about Bernadotte at Wagram206: On 5 July, 
when the French attack had been halted—largely as a result of his 
irresolute conduct—Bernadotte was occupying the village of 
Aderklaa in the centre, and slightly in advance of the French line. 
On the morning of the 6th, when the Austrians moved up for a 
concentric attack, he was out in the open plain in front of 
Aderklaa instead of occupying the village in strength and 
positioning his front to the rear of it. When the Austrians arrived 
on the scene he thought this position too hazardous (on the 
previous day his troops had ultimately suffered severe losses 
owing to his irresolute conduct) and withdrew to a plateau behind 
Aderklaa, yet left the village unoccupied, whereupon Bellegarde's 
Austrians promptly occupied it in strength. 
This endangered the French centre, and Masséna, who com­
manded it, sent forward a division which recaptured the place 

=====第211页=====
96. Engels to Marx. 22 September 1857 177 
only to be thrown out by d'Aspre's grenadiers. Then Napoleon 
himself arrived, assumed command and devised a new battle plan, 
thereby foiling the manoeuvres of the Austrians. If Jomini's 
account is at all accurate,3 there can be absolutely no dispute about 
Bernadotte's blunders on this occasion. 
'Army' is finished, so far as the historical side is concerned, up 
to the French Revolution. I shall now get on with the modern 
period and questions of organisation generally, with which I 
conclude, and then, as soon as possible, go back to doing B's so 
that you can keep on sending  stuff,  thus putting Mr Dana into a 
better humour. Meanwhile I have received a little more money 
and enclose a £5 note. Perhaps you will manage to spend one or 
two days in Brighton after all; I shall stay here a day or two longer 
and let you know when I am going there. 
Bugeaud. Most of this is already implicit in the article 'Algeria'. 
He was a mediocre general whose victories in Algeria and 
Morocco are of no great significance. That he conquered Algeria 
with 100,000 men, adapted his conduct of the war there to the 
terrain and the enemy, and broke, or rather suppressed, the 
resistance of the Arabs (not the Kabyles), does not, to my mind, 
earn him a very high rating, for I don't believe he was responsible 
for the plans. He was something of a sabreur b and, on the Tafna,208 
showed not only that he was venal but also that he was irresolute 
when in a tight corner. With 100,000 men and subordinates such 
as Lamoricière, Changarnier, Cavaignac, Négrier and Duvivier, 
who had ten years of warfare behind them, he would not need 
very much natural ability to achieve something—especially since 
the French General Staff is very  good;  furthermore, his activity was 
largely confined to making dispositions (where there's no knowing 
how much was done for him by the staff) and to commanding the 
reserve, since only individual divisions and brigades were operat­
ing at any one spot. 
Bosquet. On the Alma209 he led the French right wing in an 
outflanking movement against the Russian left wing with a 
determination and speed which earned the recognition of the 
Russians; he even succeeded in getting the artillery onto the 
plateau up trackless defiles regarded as impassable. For this he 
would deserve high praise had he not been facing a numerically 
very much inferior opponent.—At Balaklava he was immediate-

ly at hand to help disengage the English right wing, thus enabling 
the rest of the English light cavalry to withdraw under cover of his 
troops and discouraging the Russians from advancing any further. 
At Inkerman, 34 in the early hours of the morning, he was ready to 
intervene with 3 battalions and 2 batteries, but, his help having 
been refused, he placed 3 brigades in reserve behind the English 
right wing (on the Chernaya slope) and at 11 o'clock moved up 
with 2 of them into the firing line, whereupon the Russians began 
to withdraw. The English had committed all their troops whereas 
the Russians still had 16 battalions at their disposal and, but for 
Bosquet, the English would have been lost. The 16 intact Russian 
battalions covered the retreat. There could be little question of 
pursuit in this case, there being no more than 3,000 paces between 
the battle field and the edge of the plateau. On each occasion, 
then, Bosquet showed himself quick off the mark, alert, active, in 
short, an exemplary corps commander—as he did also throughout 
the time he led the covering corps on the Chernaya slope.3 
Whether he's up to much as a general en chef is hard to say; he has 
a number of qualities and if, as in his case, a man is a first-rate 
vanguard general, all that remains is for him to prove his strategic 
ability, but for this there was not much opportunity throughout 
the whole of the Sebastopol campaign.210 
Blücher. During the 1794 campaign in the Palatinate 211 he 
distinguished himself as an outpost general and light cavalry 
commander. The best proof of this is to be found in his published 
diary, still regarded as a classic despite the bad German.b  He kept 
the French constantly on the qui vive, while providing his 
headquarters with first-rate intelligence on the movements of the 
enemy, and he was continually carrying out coups de main and 
surprise attacks, for the most part successfully. At Auerstedt in 
1806, 205 when his cavalry charge miscarried, his advice that it be 
repeated using all available reinforcements was rejected (this from 
memory).  His withdrawal to Lübeck and the stubborn stand he put 
up is one of the few honourable episodes in this affair, though 
during the course of it his strategic moves were often of the 
Hussar type. Nor was it his fault that he was finally captured for, 
like the whole of the Prussian army, he was cut off and had, 
moreover, the longest detour to make round the rearguard. 
During the period up to 1813 he was regarded by Scharnhorst 
and the Tugendbund 212 (being one of its known leaders,

Engels. - b G. L. Blücher, Kampagne-Journal der Jahre 1793 und 1794.

Gneisenau remained throughout his life  SUSPECT  in the King's a eyes) 
as the only possible and suitable leader and was dubbed a hero by 
them, as Hecker was by Blind and Co.213 Nor could they have 
picked on a better man. He was, as Muffling says,b  THE  MODEL  OF A 
SOLDIER  while at the same time sharing to the full the intense popular 
antipathy to Napoleon and the French. Plebeian in his appetites, 
dialect, turns of phrase and manners, he had a tremendous gift 
for inspiring the common soldier with enthusiasm. As a soldier he 
possessed reckless courage, a keen eye for terrain, quickness of 
decision and enough intelligence to discover for himself what was 
best in more simple situations, and to rely on Gneisenau 
and Muffling in more complex ones. Of strategy, he had no 
inkling. 
*'It was no secret to Europe, that Prince Blücher who had now, 1815, passed 
his 70th year, understood nothing whatever of the conduct of a war; so little, 
indeed, that when a plan was laid before him for approval, even relating to some 
unimportant operation, he could not form any clear idea of it or judge whether it 
was good or bad.'* 
For he was quite incapable of reading a map, a strategical 
disability he shared with almost half of Napoleon's marshals. On 
the other hand he had Gneisenau, whom he trusted implicitly. 
Without Blücher, the campaign of 1813 and 1814 would have 
ended very differendy; no other general of that time could have 
done what he did—namely, by means of a victory and a skilfully 
conducted pursuit (Katzbach c) weld the most refractory elements 
(Langeron and York in open rebellion against him) into a 
homogeneous army 214 capable of anything and with which, on his 
own responsibility, he could risk marching on Wartenburg and the 
Saale —militarily a most audacious but politically (because of 
Bernadotte) an essential move, thereby abandoning all his 
communications and compelling the sluggish large army (which he 
had saved in Silesia after the battle of Dresden, 5 by pursuing the 
French as far as Bautzen so that Napoleon had to turn against 
him) to chance its arm too at Leipzig.198  Altogether it was a 
somewhat rebellious time, and Blücher had agreed with SU of the 
Army of the North (Bülow, Tauentzien, Wintzingerode) that if 
Bernadotte made no move they would, on their own responsibility, 
join up with Blücher. After the batde of Leipzig, Blücher was the 
only one who applied himself in any way to the pursuit, though

quotes from p. 225 of this book). - c Polish name: Kaczawa.

even this wasn't what it should have been—he was hampered by 
the presence of the princes. The strategic blunders that were so 
severely punished in the Montmirail region in 1814 must be laid at 
the door of Gneisenau and Muffling,216  while the decision to 
march on Paris, coûte que coûte* which resolved the campaign, must 
be credited to Blücher. The march on Waterloo in 1815 after the 
batde of Ligny 217 is another considerable feather in Blücher's cap; 
here he is almost without equal and no general except Blücher 
could have spurred his troops on to such  EFFORTS—namely,  to 
embark forthwith on the exemplary pursuit to Paris which ranks 
equally with that from Jena 46 to Stettinb  as a classic prototype. 
That Blücher was able to overawe even abler generals is evident 
from his attitude to Langeron (who had commanded a large army 
against the Turks and was a cultivated French émigré) and to 
York, both of whom, for all their initial refractoriness, not only 
soon submitted to him, but actually went right over onto his side, 
becoming his best subordinates. Au fond c Blücher was a cavalry 
general; that was his speciality and in it he excelled because this is 
a purely tactical role which does not presuppose any strategic 
knowledge. He asked a great deal of his troops but they did it, 
and willingly, and I don't suppose any other 19th-century general 
save Napoleon and, more latterly, Radetzky, could have exacted 
from them what Blücher did. It should further be recognised that 
nowhere and at no time did he lose head or heart, that he was as 
dogged in defence as he was resolute in attack and that in difficult 
situations he was quick to make up his mind. Enfin, 6 in the 
1813-15 war, which was half way to being an insurrectionary-
war, he was quite the right man and was well complemented by 
his staff;  and such being the case he was a very dangerous adver­
sary. 6

Dear Engels, 
Very many thanks for the letter and enclosure. 
I would, of course, very much like to see you before you leave. 
// at all feasible I shall come down to Brighton. The trouble is that 
the end of the quarter brings an accumulation of all the  DIFFICULTIES 
one has been staving off throughout the summer. The main 
thing—and the only way out of my quandary—is to get on 
quickly with the Cyclopaedia. The coming of autumn also means 
redeeming this and that from the pawnshops. 
I hope to have done with the biographies (all of them) by next 
week.218 (Is there anything to be said about that jackass, Sir 
G. Brovm?) 
I have begun a SERIES in the Tribune on the Bonaparte regime's 
deeds of financial derring-do.219 To this I devote the days when 
there is no Indian news. I should like also to have a personal 
discussion with you about India, MAP IN HAND. Up till now I have 
always managed instinctively to hit the nail on the head. But soon 
it will be time for me to provide a kind of general military summary 
of the affair. 
A few days ago, on my way to the Museum,a I came such a 
purler that my forehead is still complaining. 
I trust you are taking iron. A day or two ago I was talking to Dr 
Lichtenberg at the German hospital, a very knowledgable little 
chap.  He said that it was indispensable in after-treatment.

Dear Marx, 
Depicted above is the castle where Cromwell incarcerated 
Charles I for a while. I shall inspect it more closely on Sunday. 
Your wishes concerning India coincided with an idea I had that 
you might perhaps like to have my views on the business. At the 
same time I took the opportunity of going over the contents of the 
latest MAIL map in hand and voici ce qui en résulte. 3 
The situation of the English in the middle and upper reaches of 
the Ganges is so incongruous that militarily speaking the only 
right course would be to effect a junction between Havelock's 
column and the one from Delhi, if possible at Agra, after each had 
done everything possible to evacuate the detached or invested

garrisons in the area; to man, besides Agra, only the neighbouring 
stations south of the Ganges, especially Gwalior (on account of the 
Central Indian princes) and to hold the stations lower down the 
Ganges—Allahabad, Benares, Dinapur—with the existing garri­
sons and reinforcements from Calcutta; meanwhile to escort 
women and non-combatants down river, so that the troops again 
become mobile; and to employ mobile columns to instil respect in 
the region and to obtain supplies. If Agra cannot be held, there 
must be a withdrawal to Cawnpore or Allahabad; the latter to be 
held at all costs since it is the key to the territory between the 
Ganges and the Jumna. 
If Agra can be held and the Bombay army remains available, 
the armies of Bombay and Madras must hold the peninsula 
proper up to the latitude of Ahmedabad and Calcutta and send 
out columns to establish communications with the north—the 
Bombay army via Indor and Gwalior to Agra, the Madras army 
via Saugor and Gwalior to Agra, and via Jubbulpore to Allahabad. 
The other lines of communication would then run to Agra from 
the Punjab, assuming it is held, and from Calcutta via Dinapur 
and Allahabad, so that there would be 4 lines of communication 
and, excluding the Punjab, 3 lines of withdrawal, to Calcutta, 
Bombay and Madras. Concentrating the troops arriving from the 
south at Agra would, therefore, serve the dual purpose of keeping 
the Central Indian princes in check and subduing the insurgent 
districts astride the line of march. 
If Agra cannot be held, the Madras army must first establish 
communications with Allahabad and then make for Agra with 
the Allahabad troops, while the Bombay army makes for 
Gwalior. 
The Madras army would seem to have been recruited exclusive­
ly from the ragtag and bobtail and to that extent is reliable. In 
Bombay they have 150 or more Hindus to a battalion and these 
are dangerous in that they may disaffect the rest. If the Bombay 
army revolts, all military calculations will temporarily cease to 
apply, and then nothing is more certain than that there'll be one 
colossal  MASSACRE  from Kashmir to Cape Comorin. If the situation in 
Bombay is such that in future also the army cannot be used against 
the insurgents, then at least the Madras columns, which will by now 
have pushed on beyond Nagpur, will have to be reinforced and 
communications established as speedily as possible with Allahabad or 
Benares. 
The absurdity of the position in which the English have now 
been placed by the total absence of any real supreme command is

demonstrated mainly by 2 complementary circumstances, namely, 
1. that they permit themselves to be invested when dispersed over 
a host of small, far flung stations while 2. they tie down their one 
and only mobile column in front of Delhi where not only can it do 
nothing but is actually going to pot. The English general who 
ordered the march on Delhi3 deserves to be cashiered and hanged, 
for he must have known what we have only just learned, viz. that 
the British had strengthened the old fortifications to the point 
where the place could only be taken by a systematic siege, for 
which a minimum of 15-20,000 men would be required, and far 
more if it was well defended. Now that they are there they will 
have to stick it out for political reasons; a withdrawal would be a 
defeat and will nevertheless be difficult to avoid.b 
Havelock's troops have worked wonders. 126 miles in 8 days 
including 6 to 8C engagements in that climate and at this time of 
year is truly superhuman. But they're also quite played out; he, 
too, will probably have to let himself be invested after exhausting 
himself still further by excursions over a narrow radius round 
Cawnpore. Or he will have to return to Allahabad. 
The actual route of reconquest will run up the valley of the 
Ganges. Bengal proper will be easier to hold since the population 
has so greatly degenerated; the really dangerous region begins at 
Dinapur. Hence the positions at Dinapur, Benares, Mirzapur and 
particularly Allahabad are of the utmost importance; from 
Allahabad, it would first be necessary to take the Doab (between 
the Ganges and the Jumna) and the cities on these two rivers, 
then Oudh, then the rest. The lines from Madras and Bombay 
to Agra and Allahabad can only be secondary lines of opera­
tions. 
The main thing, as always, is concentration. The reinforcements 
sent up the Ganges are scattered all over the place and so far not 
one man has reached Allahabad. Unavoidable, perhaps, if these , 
stations were to be made secure and then again, perhaps not.d  At 
all events, the number of stations to be held must be reduced to a 
minimum and forces must be concentrated for the field. If 
C. Campbell, about whom we know nothing save that he is a brave 
man, wants to distinguish himself as a general, he must create a 
mobile army, coûte que coûte,*  whether or not Delhi is abandoned.

And where, summa summarum, there are 25-30,000 European 
soldiers, no situation is so desperate that  5,000  at least cannot be 
mustered for a campaign, their losses being made good by the 
garrisons withdrawn from the stations. Only then will Campbell be 
able to see how he stands and what kind of enemy is actually 
confronting him. THE  ODDS  ARE,  HOWEVER,  that  LIKE  A FOOL  he will se blottir 
devant 3 Delhi and watch his men go to pot  AT THE RATE  OF 100  A DAY,  in 
which case it will be all the more 'brave' simply to stay there until 
everyone has cheerfully met his doom. Now as in the past brave 
stupidity is the order of the day. b 
Concentration of forces for the fighting in the north, vigorous 
support from Madras and, if possible, from Bombay, that's all. 
Even if the Mahratta princes 221 on the Nerbudda defect it can do 
little harm save by way of an example, for their troops are already 
with the insurgents. Certainly the very most that can be done is to 
hold out until the first reinforcements arrive from Europe at the 
end of October. But if a few more Bombay regiments revolt, that 
will be the end of strategy and tactics; it's there that the decision 
lies. 222 
I leave for Brighton on Tuesday at the latest and set out from 
there for Jersey at 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, but will let you 
have further details, and hope that you will come. Tomorrow shall 
start on 'Battery', etc.223 Today I drove round the island and, as I 
again slogged away until 3 o'clock yesterday, now propose to have 
a good long sleep.

MARX TO ENGELS 224 
IN RYDE 
[London,] 25 September 1857 
Dear Engels, 
I presume you will have received today my letter of the day 
before yesterday acknowledging the £5. I cannot understand the 
delay, having myself taken it to the post on time. 
Your 'Army' is capital; except that I was thunderstruck by the 
sheer bulk of it—so much work can't possibly be good for you. 
And if I'd known that you would work late into the night I would 
rather have let the whole thing go to the devil. 
More graphically than anything else the history of the  ARMY 
demonstrates the Tightness of our views as to the connection 
between the productive forces and social relations. Altogether, the 
ARMY  is of importance in economic development. E.g. it was in the 
army of Antiquity that the salaire* was first fully developed. 
Likewise the peculium castrense in Rome, the first legal form 
according recognition to the movable property of others than 
fathers of families. Likewise the guild system in the corporation of 
the fabri. 225 Here too the first use of machinery on a large scale. 
Even the special value of metals and their  USE  as money would 
seem to have been based originally—as soon as Grimm's Stone 
Age was over—on their significance in war. Again, the division of 
labour within a branch was first put into practice by armies. All 
this, moreover, a very striking epitome of the whole history of civil 
societies. If you ever have the time, you might work the thing out 
from that point of view. 
The only points I think you have overlooked in your account 
are: 1. the earliest manifestation of a ready-made mercenary 
system on a large scale  AND AT ONCE  among the Carthaginians (for 
our own PRIVATE USE I shall take a look at a work—previously 
unknown to me—by a Berlin man on the Carthaginian armiesb); 
2. the development of the army system in the 15th and early 16th 
centuries in Italy, where tactical ruses, at any rate, were perfected. 
Likewise an extremely humorous description of Machiavelli's 
a wages - b  Presumably W. Bötticher's Geschichte der Carthager.

(which I shall extract for you) in his History of  Florence 3 of how the 
condottieri 226 fought. (But if I come and meet you in Brighton 
(when?), 227 perhaps I had better bring you the Machiavelli. The 
History of Florence is a masterpiece.) Lastly, 3. the Asiatic military 
system as it first appeared in Persia and subsequently in various 
much modified forms among, inter alia, the Mongols and Turks. 
In writing my biographies, etc., I naturally had to consult all 
sorts of encyclopaedias, including German ones. In so doing I 
discovered that, under the headings 'Labour', 'Classes', 'Produc­
tion', etc., much had been systematically if stupidly cribbed from us. 
On the other hand, everyone had eschewed all mention of ourselves, 
even when devoting whole columns to Mr Edgar Bauer and other 
such panjandrums. Tant mieux pour nous} The biographies in the 
German encyclopaedias are written for children under 8 years of 
age. The French, if biased, are at least urbane. The English 
encyclopaedias crib systematically from the French and German. In 
the latter, the same fellows appear to unload the same twaddle onto 
different publishers. Ersch and Gruber 0 not much good except in 
the later volumes, wherein many learned articles.

big, jet-black beard thereby giving himself a strange appearance in 
some ways not unlike that of the greasy Jew in the boat that 
brought us ashore from the STEAMER; CERTAINLY an IMPROVEMENT. He 
made rather light of his Jersey POLITICS, saying he got  A GREAT  DEAL  OF 
FUN out of them, etc. 229; the more serious view he certainly takes of 
them will no doubt emerge later on. Afterwards he and I went on 
a mild spree and I got him to tell me about the constitution, etc., 
etc., here; not a word was said about the old days. For the time 
being he seems DAMD GLAD to have withdrawn from high politics 
into his little royaume des aveugles. As a borgne* he's king of the 
opposition here, on his right THE FIRST GROCER, on his left THE FIRST 
TALLOW-CHANDLER IN THE TOWN. The battles are fought out in Royal 
Square and it was here that the GROCER knocked DOWN the rédacteur 
en chef of the Impartial de Jersey,  a Bonapartist spy called Lemoine, 
the upshot of which was a lawsuit that has gone on for the past 
year and is to be decided on Monday. The Impartial has been 
suspended since the beginning of the monetary crisis in Paris and, 
so long as this lasts, will remain so. In Harney's view the whole 
history of Jersey may be divided into 2 periods: before and after 
the Hejira, or the expulsion of the crapauds. 230 They are 
noteworthy for the fact that nothing happened during either of 
them. 
Schramm is busy with plans for new lodgings but will probably 
stay where he is after all. I urged him to move further south but, 
like most people in his condition, he tends to be contrary and also 
says that it is a question of money and that his relatives were 
already doing what they could. From Harney's description it's 
often downright cold here in winter when there's an east wind, 
and Schramm lives on the side of the town most exposed to the 
north-west winds. If, as he says, his difficulty in walking is no 
greater than it was three years ago, the disease may of course drag 
on for some time yet. Proof that here, too, people can contract 
consumption and die of it is provided by a case in this very house, 
for the daughter of my fat landlady succumbed to it. I hardly like 
to speak to him any more about moving south; it rubs him up the 
wrong way and he is after all very tetchy, as is only natural. As 
things stand I have not yet got down to work and there is also 
a mass of letters to be written; but tomorrow I shall make a 
start. 
a Engels alludes to the French saying, 'Au royaume des aveugles les borgnes sont rois' 
('In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king*).

Yesterday I walked to the north coast—5 or 6 miles from here, 
very good roads, a pretty avenue here and there, magnificent 
blackberries en masse and a few very lovely small inlets on the 
coast. The island forms a plateau and once you're on top, it rises 
very gently almost as far as the north coast, and the beds of the 
streams are quite shallow. From the northern end you can see a 
long stretch of France (west coast of the Département de la 
Manche) and the island of Sark. I couldn't see Guernsey. 
Schramm's brother3  has informed him that a friend of his, a 
(probably Prussian) lawyer by the name of Berger ,b about 50 years 
old, will be arriving in a few days and will spend the winter here. 
Do you know this individual? Presumably the fellow lives in 
London, and it is always as well to be informed to some extent 
about Mr Rudolf Schramm's acquaintances. I have a vague 
recollection that a fellow of this description bumped into us once 
in London. 
I have also tracked down Steffen's guerrilla warfare in respect 
of Berg and the Mark: Holleben, Militairische Betrachtungen aus den 
Erfahrungen eines preussischen Offiziers. This book is his chief 
authority and maintains that the hedge and ditch country in parts 
of the Mark and Cleves recalls La Vendée, 231 and is admirably 
suited to a people's war. Not so the people who live there, 
unfortunately—this being the flat, agricultural part of the Mark. 
For the rest the book is a good one, but just the thing to 
encourage Steffen's predilection for skirmishes and guerrilla 
warfare; it leans too far in this direction. 
Enclosed the list for C with comments 232

Dear Marx, 
Herewith the BALANCE of the old sins of omission, also the 
original notes on the Armada. I couldn't quite decipher some of 
the names, which you will have to try and fill in. 34 I am now 
going on to the HISTORY OF CANNON. 
Schramm seems to me to be getting rather worse, though his 
condition changes from day to day. At present he has Bergera 
with him, a philistine sent by his brother,b  who has taken lodgings 
in the same house and to whom he is giving English lessons. He's 
a dirty-minded old Prussian who tells lewd jokes devoid of wit 
about all the court rabble in Berlin, que le diable l'einporte! c I 
haven't seen FRIEND Harney for a week. He's awfully stupid and 
feels very COMFORTABLE indeed in his philistine role here, although 
even on his PAPER" 1 he is clearly subject to the owner's censorship. 
He anticipates, of course, that sooner or later the English workers 
will do something or other, but that it won't be at all in the 
Chartist line, and anyway what he says is so much theoretical hot 
air and he would undoubtedly detest being jolted out of his petty 
philistine agitation here. HE IS VERY BUSY, BUT BUSY DOING NOTHING. His 
friend the GROCER, who thrashed the French spy,e has been fined 
£5. 
Besides the HISTORY  OF CANNON,  I intend to do a few of the shorter 
things and send them to you from time to time so that Dana may 
see that we're keeping the ball rolling. But do send me those notes 
about which I wrote to you, and the list of military articles for D. 
I presume you got the letter containing the copy of the C list,232 and 
also the article 'Military Bridges'' sent off later.

[London,] 20 October 1857 
DEAR  Frederick, 
You must excuse my long silence. In the first place, we've had a 
visitor for the past week, to wit Imandt junior (aged 13), who has 
arrived here from Trier en route to his uncle,3 and I have had to 
show the lad round. In the second, much work. 
Now  d'abord^  your plan to return to Manchester. You must 
know whether or not your presence is necessary. It certainly won't 
do your health any good, for the weather over here is ABOMINABLE. 
Allen thinks that you owe it to yourself to spend far more time 
recuperating in a better climate than the Manchester  ONE,  since any 
relapse might be fatal. But it must be supposed that you consult 
your doctor c before coming to a decision. 
The American crisis—its outbreak in New York was forecast by 
us in the November 1850 Revued—is BEAUTIFUL and has had 
IMMEDIATE repercussions on French industry, since silk goods are 
now being sold in New York more cheaply than they are produced 
in Lyons. The lamentations of the English  MONEY  ARTICLE  WRITERS,  who 
complain that, while their English TRADE is SOUND, their customers 
abroad are UNHEALTHY, are as original as they are diverting. How 
are the Manchester manufacturers getting on? Those in Glasgow 
have,  it now transpires, sent off a great deal on consignment.

contesting that  his  stay  in London  was a  fruitful one. Moreover,  in 
his estimate  of the  dette flottante such curious tricks  are  played with 
the SINKING  FUND,  etc., that the  AUDITING  is exceedingly equivocal. But 
the fellow  is not  without  a certain gambler's humour.  By his 
reckoning there was no deficit whatever and no  FLOATING DEBT  in 
1852—the  1st  year  of the  imperial millennium.  For he  placed  50 
million  frs to the  ACCOUNT  of 1851 (in  accordance with  the  absurd 
French practice,  the  1851 budget  was  FIXED  in August 1850,  but not 
CLOSED  until 1854),  and  debited 1853 with  the  balance. Unlike Louis 
Philippe,  he ushered  in his  régime with a No  DEFICIT,  but in 1853, 
the very next year, unblushingly presented  the  biggest  FLOATING DEBT 
France  had  known since 1800. When  in 1849  the  Finance Minister, 
Passy, proposed that  he  limit  and  fund  the  FLOATING DEBT,  he 
dismissed  him  forthwith  and  appointed Achille Fould. Come  to 
that,  his  financial system  is the  same  as Louis Philippe's save that  it 
is sans gêne, c is taken  to extremes,  and  SLEIGHTS OF HAND  are the  rule.

[St. Hélier,] Jersey, 29 October 1857 
3 Edward Place 
Dear Marx, 
I shall be returning to Manchester a week from today,183  but 
don't yet know what route I shall take. Your letter induced me to 
question Heckscher again (I had, of course, already consulted him 
concerning my return) about the possibility of a fatal relapse. 
From his reply I can only conclude that he believes a relapse 
might be fatal only if the lungs were affected, and is willing to 
guarantee that this will not be so in my case. At all events, he 
doesn't think Jersey is of much benefit to me any more; either the 
thing's over, or I must go much further south, and should anyhow 
return to Manchester, if only as an experiment, since I can always 
go away again. Now I'm simply waiting for some money and then 
I'll be off. By that time the HISTORY  OF CANNON  235 will be finished and 
I'd rather do the other things—with possibly a few small 
exceptions—in Manchester where my books are. I should like to 
have the D list soon, otherwise Mr Dana will steal a march on us. 
What else does the noble fellow have to say, or haven't you heard 
from him? 
So drastically has the iron acted on my blood that my pulse has 
begun racing madly and the blood is always rising to my head; it's

as though I'd been drinking—I feel quite fuddled and my 
excitation is such that I can't sleep at night. So for the time being 
I've had to stop taking it again. When I go back onto it in 
Manchester I shall have to reduce the dose considerably. 
The advancing season is having a most debilitating effect on 
Schramm. Needless to say, he can only go out very little now and 
seldom comes into the town and only at the cost of considerable 
effort. The old philistine3 sent to him by his brotherb is a very 
bawdy fellow, who knows all the Berlin gossip, but in other ways 
stupid and boring. However, he'll be able to pester Konrad's 
worthy brother on Konrad's  behalf,  and this he has promised me 
to do. Schramm has had a door made in the wall between his 
bedroom and living-room which enables him to heat the former a 
bit and avoid going out into the hall in winter. This has put an 
end to the house-hunting. He'll hardly outlast the spring, poor 
devil. 
Harney grows more stupid every day. Considering the nature of 
the feudal arrangements here,237 he should be able to make  A DEAL 
OF POLITICAL CAPITAL out of them, but he doesn't even begin to 
understand them and, moreover, ruins all the best points made by 
the little lawyer who supplies him with material and even complete 
articles. There is, by the way, much that is funny about this 
dead-and-alive feudal set-up, and the whole business is preposter­
ous to a degree. A modern lawyerc  for Seigneur and St. Hélier 
SHOPKEEPERS for vassals—the masquerade is altogether grotesque. 
Just now the fellows are holding feudal courts of justice; the 
prévôt du Seigneur is a CARVER and GILDER who doesn't know a word 
of French and, although he's the second personage here, hasn't an 
inkling of what's going on. The Seigneur threatens to confiscate 
the houses of his unruly vassals, who make up some 60-70 per 
cent of the total number, while the vassals—DRAPERS and TALLOW-

The Sepoys must have defended the ENCEINTE of Delhi very 
badly238; the real joke was the house-to-house fighting when, 
presumably, the NATIVE TROOPS were sent in first. So the actual 
siege—what came afterwards could hardly be described as 
such—lasted from the 5th to the 14th, long enough for breaches 
to be made in the unprotected wall by heavy naval guns firing at a 
range of 300-400 yards. These were already in position by the 5th 
or 6th. The cannon on the walls do not appear to have been 
effectively manned, otherwise the English wouldn't have been able 
to make so swift an approach. 
The AMERICAN  CRASH  is superb and not yet over by a long chalk. 
We still have to see the collapse of the better part of the import 
houses; so far only one here and there would appear to have 
crashed. The repercussion in England would seem to have begun 
with the Liverpool Borough Bank. Tant mieux. 11 That means that, 
for the next 3 or 4 years, commerce will again be in a bad way.

If you could let me have the  HISTORY  OF CANNON  235 by Friday, IT 
WOULD  BE A  GREAT BOON.  As soon as the next mail arrives from India, 
you must write  to me at  some length about  the  Delhi affair  or

some degree  of compensation  was  called  for. 
So far as  your resolution  as to  Manchester  is concerned,  it seems

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 13 November 1857 
Dear Engels, 
A week ago on Thursday240 I waited at both the appointed 
places—which, however, was one too many—from 11 o'clock to 3. 
Then I gave the whole thing up IN DESPAIR. 
I can write no more than a line or two, the article3 having left 
me only a few minutes until posting time. Let me know definitely 
when I can have 'Cannon'.235 It's a matter of getting the goods off to 
America at what is (for me) a crucial moment. 
Meanwhile I haven't written a word about India. I have got to 
have some accurate military stuff on the subject, EVENTS having to 
some extent discredited myself and the Tribune.241 
Though my own FINANCIAL DISTRESS may be dire indeed, never, 
since 1849, have I felt  so COSY  as during this OUTBREAK. Furthermore 
you can set Lupus' mind at rest by telling him that,  NOW  THAT THE 
WHOLE STATEMENT is BEFORE us, I have written an exhaustive ARTICLE for 
the Tribune* in which I show, if only on the basis of the table of 
DISCOUNT-RATES for 1848-54, that the crisis ought by rights to have set 
in 2 years earlier. Moreover the DELAYS are now explicable in such 
rational terms that even Hegel might, to his great SATISFACTION, have 
rediscovered the 'concept' in the 'empirical diversity of the world 
of finite interests'. 
Salut. 
Your 
K. M. 
Go on sending me, as you started to do, as many Manchester 
papers as possible. Not only for the Tribune. I am thinking of 
writing about the crisis for the benefit of the fatherland.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 15 November 1857 
Dear Marx, 
I'm sorry about your waiting for me last Monday—I didn't 
arrive at Euston Square until after 6, THANKS TO  BAD  ARRANGEMENTS OF 
THE RAILWAY COMPANY  IN BRIGHTON, and travelled on to Manchester the 
same evening. 
I'm in good health and everyone, even Heckscher, is surprised 
that I should have recovered so well. My memory is still poor, the 
DULLNESS persists to some extent, and alcohol no longer agrees with 
me. My last sore is healing up beautifully, a process which riding 
and a reduction of work at the office cannot fail to help; as to the 
latter I have agreed with our factory to put myself on SHORT TIME. 
You should have 'Cannon'235 for certain by next Friday's post. It 
can't be done before that and will amount to about 10 full sheets. 
The rest of C ought to follow shortly; most of it is trifling stuff 
which can be done quickly with the books I have here. 
As soon as I can see daylight in my financial affairs (now in 
great confusion) I shall send you some money. 
This time the crisis is developing in rather a curious way. For 
almost a year now, speculative share dealings in France and 
Germany have been in a state of what might be described as 
pre-crisis; only now, with the collapse of the main speculative 
share dealings in New York, has everything come to a head. As 
always, of course, the Yankees have been doing their swindling 
with foreign capital, but the really remarkable thing is that this 
time the capital has come predominantly from the Continent. The 
bureaucrats and rentiers in Germany, who have been eagerly 
buying up everything provided it was American, will be well and 
truly bled. Because of the above-mentioned pre-crisis and the few 
direct points of contact between continental and American 
stock-exchange swindles, the destructive repercussions of the latter 
are not immediately making themselves felt. But they soon will. 
Speculation has affected not only shares but all raw materials 
and colonial produce, hence also all manufactured goods where 
the cost of the raw material is still strongly reflected in the price; 
hence the closer they are to the raw material and the dearer the 
raw material, the more they are affected. Yarns more than grey

106. Engels to Marx. 15 November 1857 201 
goods, the latter more than printed or coloured goods, silk goods 
more than cotton goods. Here, we have had a pre-crisis in silk 
since August; approximately 20 manufactures have failed for an 
amount I would hesitate to put at less than £200,000 and of which 
only 35% to 40% at the most will be recovered. We are in for 
£6,000, which makes my share £300!!! or, taking the most 
optimistic view, £180 after payment of dividends. In these 
circumstances I shall probably have to come to a new agreement 
with my old man. That is by the way. The crisis in silk continues. 
The failure of Bennoch, Twentyman & Rigg (competitors of 
Blank's) has caught 5 silk ribbon manufacturers in Coventry to the 
tune of £100,000, the biggest sum being £40,000 and the smallest 
£6,000. In addition T. S. Reed & Co. of Derby, important silk 
spinners, doublers and manufacturers, became insolvent im­
mediately after, and in consequence of, Bennoch's failure. In 
Glasgow a whole crowd of small and medium firms, besides those 
mentioned in the papers, have come a cropper without eliciting 
the least comment or inquiry. Whether the Maison Ernst Dronke 
is among them I don't know. Maybe he didn't have the sense to 
take advantage of the moment to make an honourable exit. 
The enclosed chart,3 which I have prepared from official 
printed reports supplied by our broker, will show you how the 
cotton market has fared this year. Whenever the horizontal black line 
passes between two of the eighths this means that the price was 
midway between, or Vi6th, thus e.g. between  7 3/sd and 71/id 
means 77/i6d. 
As far as industrial production itself is concerned, America's 
excess stocks would seem to be mainly in the west; from all I hear, 
stocks of manufactured goods in the eastern ports are very low. 
But that these are already  A DRUG  ON THE  MARKET  is borne out by the 
return of entire shipments from New York to Liverpool. 3U of the 
local spinners are making for stock and only V4 at the most have 
orders on their books. SHORT  TIME  pretty well general. A very active 
yarn commission house here, which 3 weeks ago had contracts 
worth £45,000, now has only £3,000 worth, so quickly have the 
spinners been able to deliver, despite SHORT TIME. 
The peculiarly favourable advices from Madras and Bombay 
(sales with profit, which has not been the case since 1847) have 
revived the Indian trade. Everyone who possibly can is rushing 
into it. To the annoyance of the other commission houses, 
S. Mendel, INDIAN agent, has the whole of his big WAREHOUSE lit up

until 10 o'clock every night and sends out stuff for all he's worth. 
No DOUBT  hundreds of spinners and weavers are shipping goods 
there on consignment. So we have a reserve crisis up our sleeve 
there in case this first impact proves incapable of overturning the 
old muck.242 
The general appearance of the Exchange here was truly 
delightful last week. The fellows are utterly infuriated by my 
sudden and inexplicable onset of high spirits. INDEED, the Exchange 
is the one place where my current DULLNESS is transformed into 
resilience and BOUNCING. On top of that my predictions are, of 
course, always gloomy, which makes the asses doubly furious. On 
Thursday the situation was at its most dismal, on Friday the 
gentlemen were mulling over the possible effects of the suspension 
of the Bank Act132  and, with COTTON rising another Id., word went 
round that the worst was over. By yesterday, however, the most 
delectable DESPONDENCY again prevailed; all the hosannas had been so 
much hot air and, since hardly anyone wanted to buy, the market 
here remained as bad as ever. 
What promises this crisis a brilliant future is the immediate 
necessity of suspending the Bank Act at the first impact. The direct 
effect of this will be to land the Bank itself in Queer Street. In 
1847 it was still possible to let things drag on as they had done 
since 1845, and not to resort to this measure until the very last 
and grimmest moment. 
The extension and prolongation of the crisis are also assured. 
The combination of SHORT TIME and the silk crisis, which latter has 
already deprived the vast mass of the silk (HAND-LOOM) weavers of 
their livelihood, will of itself suffice to ruin the HOME TRADE 
completely this winter—up till the end of October it was still 
doing well. The American crisis is playing havoc with the Barmen 
and Elberfeld SMALLWARE MANUFACTURERS, the Elberfeld, Krefeld and 
Lyons silk manufacturers and the German, French and Belgian 
cloth manufacturers. The SMALLWARE MANUFACTURERS of Barmen are 
suffering particularly also due to Bennoch and Twentyman, while 
Draper, Pietroni & Co. are causing difficulties in Italy, especially 
Milan, the Duchies, 3 Bologna, etc. 
Unless cotton comes down to 6d per pound even a momentary 
revival of the cotton industry here is out of the question. And at 
present it is still as high as 7 to 7 'Ad. From this you will see how 
remote here is the prospect of any change in the state of affairs. 
Nevertheless a momentary change in the spring is possible and, 
a Tuscany, Parma and Modena

106. Engels to Marx. 15 November 1857 203 
indeed, probable. Not that this will mean 'good business', but 
rather that business can again be done so that the machinery of 
trade keeps turning and doesn't rust up. Never before has any 
crisis exhausted itself so rapidly and abruptly, and this one, 
coming after 10 years of prosperity and speculation, is least apt to 
do so. Nor is there another Australia or California to come to the 
rescue, while China will be in the doldrums for the next 20 
years. 243 However the violence of this initial blow shows what 
colossal dimensions the thing is assuming. And in view of the 
recent enormous output of gold and the correspondingly vast 
expansion of industry, it could not be otherwise. 
We can only hope that this 'improvement' in the crisis from the 
acute to the chronic stage sets in before a second and really 
decisive blow falls. A period of chronic pressure is needed to get 
the people's blood up. The proletariat will then fight better, with 
better connaissance de cause 3 and in greater unison, just as a cavalry 
attack succeeds much better if the horses have to cover the first 
500 paces at the trot before arriving within charging distance of 
the enemy. I shouldn't care for anything to happen prematurely 
before Europe as a whole has been affected; the subsequent 
struggle would be harder, more tedious and fluctuating. Even May 
or June would be somewhat too early. The long period of 
prosperity is bound to have made the masses damned lethargic. 
However, sight drafts for a revolution will now be presented to us 
by our friends Kinkel & Co. for payment; that is to be expected, 
but NEVER MIND, we shall honour them soon enough, as these 
gentlemen will see. 
It's capital that you should be collecting material on this crisis. I 
am sending you another 2 Guardians today. You shall have it 
regularly, and the Examiner and Times too now and again. I shall 
also advise you as frequently as possible of everything I learn so 
that we have a good STOCK OF FACTS. 
I must say I feel just as you do. When the bubble burst in New 
York I grew very restless in Jersey and in the midst of this GENERAL 
DOWNBREAK I fell tremendously cheerful. The bourgeois filth of the 
last seven years has undoubtedly clung to me to some extent; now 
it will be washed away and I shall become a changed man. 
Physically, the crisis will do me as much good as a bathe in the sea; 
I can sense it already. In 1848 we were saying: Now our time is 
coming, and so IN  A CERTAIN SENSE it was, but this time it is coming 
properly; now it's a case of do or die. This will at once give a more 
a knowledge of what they are doing

best school  of all.

MARX  TO  ENGELS 1 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  24 November  1857 
DEAR  Frederick, 
You must excuse  me for not  having acknowledged receipt either 
of the  money,  or of the  article3  or of  various letters.  The  comings 
and goings connected with  DOMESTIC AFFAIRS  have made such 
demands  on my  time that little  was  left for  work. 
The  MONETARY PANIC  in London has  SUBSIDED  to some extent during 
the past  few  days  but  will soon begin afresh with  the  assistance  of, 
among others, Fould,  who  has  come over here with  a French bank 
director  in order  to regulate  the  export  of gold from England  to 
France.  The  actual  SUSPENSION  of the  Bank Act1S2  could,  of course, 
only be effective in so far as it did away with the  PANIC SURPLUS 
artificially created by the Bank Act. The  BANKING DEPARTMENT  should 
have  had to  declare itself insolvent  the  following  day  since  the 
reserve fund amounted  to no  more than four  or  five hundred 
thousand pounds, whereas  DEPOSITS—PUBLIC  and  PRIVATE—exceeded 
17 millions.  On the  other hand this danger  was  created solely  by 
the Act itself in that the metal reserve in the  ISSUING DEPARTMENT  was 
not much below one-third of the  ISSUED  NOTES.  The Act precipitated 
the outbreak of the  MONEY  PANIC,  thereby perhaps reducing its 
intensity. However, lendings  by the  Bank  up to a  maximum  of 
10% (on  FIRST-RATE PAPERS)  will keep  a mass  of transactions going 
which must ultimately lead  to another  CRASH.  If, for  instance,  the 
price  of  corn, sugar,  etc., is  currently being maintained  it is 
because their  OWNERS  are  discounting  the  bills drawn  on  them  for 
the same instead  of selling  the  commodities.  A fall in the  price  of 
these commodities seems  to me  inevitable  and  hence  I believe that 
these chaps  are  simply heading straight  for  serious bankruptcies. 
That was  EXACTLY  THE  CASE  [INJ  MAY  1847. As distinct from earlier 
crises,  what  is  still  to  some extent supporting  the  so-called 
MONEY-MARKET  in London is the existence of  JOINT-STOCK BANKS  which 
didn't really begin  to expand until  the  last ten  years.  The  interest 
they pay the  philistines, small rentiers,  etc., is 1%  less than 
the Bank  of  England's official rate.  The  lure  of 9% is too 
great  to meet with  any  serious resistance.  So the  City  mob  has the 
philistines' small capital  at its  disposal  to a  greater degree than 
a F. Engels,  'The  Capture  of Delhi'. 

=====第243页=====
109. Marx to Engels. 24 November 1857 209 
ever before. If just one of these BANKS were now to collapse, there 
would be a general uproar. Hence it is greatly to be regretted that 
the ROYAL BRITISH BANK should have crashed prematurely. 
As for America, it seems almost certain that the PROTECTIONISTS 
will prevail as a result of the crisis. This will have lasting and 
disagreeable repercussions so far as the worthy English are 
concerned. 
I don't know whether Steffen has already told you that he is 
leaving England. This is because the crisis has caused his sister 
(how, I don't know) to lose what little money she had. He is going 
to Germany to join forces with her, so that they can scrape along 
together. I think he's doing quite the wrong thing. I have it from 
a reliable source that Mrs Ruge (all she speaks is a kind of Saxon 
patois) is the only teacher of German in Brighton and, so greatly 
does demand exceed supply, that she is now launching her 
daughter 3 in the same TRADE. SO Steffen's sister would find good 
EMPLOYMENT in Brighton were Steffen himself able to get on better 
with people. Apropos Ruge. Some months ago the old jackass sent 
out a prospectus for the resuscitation of the ci-devant b Deutsche 
Jahrbücher, 244 the main object of which is to combat materialism in 
the natural sciences and in industry; idem the proliferation of 
comparative linguistics, etc.— everything, in short, that calls for 
exact knowledge. To carry out his scheme he requires 1,000 
subscribers à 10 talers. Over a period of 2 months summa 
summarum 40, I repeat 40, enthusiasts for 'intellectual freedom' 
have come forward. The muster-roll of his adherents in Germany 
is, CONSEQUENTLY, far from creditable. 
I know nothing about Mr Dronke save that some months ago he 
urged Freiligrath to play the middleman (viz. the discounter) in a 
kite-flying operation upon which he thought to embark with old 
Naut. Freiligrath, of course, sent him away with a flea in his ear. 
Shortly afterwards he wrote saying that, though his circumstances 
were 'quite good', he was prepared to work anywhere as a clerk at 
a salary of £200-250, and asked Freiligrath to look out for a post 
of this kind. All this would seem to indicate that he is about to 
make his exit from the world of commerce. 
Beckerc  has been released from prison; Bürgers, on the other 
hand, has been subjected to additional restrictions. 
In one of your letters you say that the manufacturers will be 
able to make headway only when cotton is at 6d.d But won't the 
substantial curtailment of production soon bring COTTON prices 
down to that point anyway?

Jones is playing a very inane role. As you know, long before the 
crisis and with no particular end in view unless to provide a 
pretext for agitation during the lull, he proposed to hold a 
Chartist conference to which bourgeois radicals (not just Bright, 
but even men like Cunningham) were also to be invited. 245 The 
general idea was to come to a' compromise with the bourgeois 
whereby they were to be given the BALLOT and, in return, accord 
MANHOOD  SUFFRAGE  to the workers. This proposal gave rise to splits in 
the Chartist Party and these in turn involved Jones even more 
deeply in his project. Now, instead of making use of the crisis and 
substituting genuine agitation for an ill-chosen pretext for 
agitation, he clings to his NONSENSE; he shocks the working-men by 
preaching co-operation with the bourgeois while in no way 
inspiring in the latter the slightest degree of confidence. To 
complete his ruin he is being cajoled by some of the radical 
papers. In his own sheet3 that old ass Frost, whom he himself 
proclaimed a hero and appointed chairman of his conference, has 
attacked him in a brutally outspoken letter in which inter alia he 
tells him that if he considers that the co-operation of the MIDDLE 
CLASS  is necessary—and nothing can be done without it—he should 
speak out bona fide. Who, Frost goes on to ask, gave him the right 
to draw up the programme for the conference without consulting 
his allies, and who empowered him to appoint Frost chairman and 
himself to play the dictator, etc.?b So now he's in hot water and, 
for the first time, is playing a role that is not merely inane but also 
ambiguous. I haven't seen him for some while but now intend to 
call on him. I believe him to be an honest man and, since in 
England it is impossible for A  PUBLIC  CHARACTER  to render himself 
'impossible' by his stupidities, all he has to do is extricate himself as 
soon as he can from his self-laid snare. The ass should begin by 
forming a party, for which purpose he must go to the manufactur­
ing districts. Then the radical bourgeois will come to him in search 
of compromise.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 7 December 1857 
Dear Marx, 
Last week, what with prices eternally fluctuating and stocks 
building up, I was forced by the crisis to do a great deal of 
quill-pushing and so couldn't write to you but only send you 
Guardians. 
In your last there's a SLIGHT MISTAKE. YOU say that if 'the price of 
corn, sugar, etc., is currently being maintained it is because their 
OWNERS are discounting the bills drawn on them for the same 
instead of selling the commodities'.a They, as the drawees, cannot 
discount the bills; all they have to do with bills is accept them and 
pay them when they fall due. The HOLDERS of commodities can only 
protect themselves against forced selling by obtaining advances on 
the commodities. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES this will be difficult, and 
in any case the amount of these advances will be reduced by the 
tremendous fall in the price of commodities (35% in the case of 
sugar!) and the certain knowledge that, as soon as some degree of 
forced selling becomes unavoidable, the value of the commodities 
will fall still further. So whereas the HOLDERS formerly received 
advances amounting to 2/s or 3At of the higher value of the 
commodities, they will now receive at most V2 of the reduced value, 
i.e. about half the previously obtainable advance. This will 
inevitably precipitate the crash. But there is also a possibility that 
the MINCING LANE AND MARK LANE TRADE b will continue a little longer 
in a slow decline before a few major bankruptcies occur. And 
come they will, as surely as in Liverpool and other ports. The 
amounts being lost on sugar, coffee, cotton, hides, dye-stuffs, silk, 
etc., etc., are colossal. The whole  LOT  of the 1857 cotton crop, 
estimated at 3 mill, bales (will be 3 V4), is now worth £15,000,000 
less than in September. One of the houses here has in transit 
35,000 sacks of coffee on each of which there will be a loss of £1. 
The loss on Indian cotton is just as great—33%. As the bills

drawn  in respect  of these goods fall  due,  bankruptcies cannot fail  to 
occur. 
The big  American house which, after  2 days  of negotiation with 
the Bank  of England, recently obtained  a million-pound advance, 
thereby saving  its  skin, belonged  to Mr  Peabody,  the  4TH  JULY 
ANNIVERSARY DINNER  man. 246  Latterly even Suse  & Sibeth,  the  soundest 
of houses  and the  only people besides Frühling  & Göschen whose 
bills continued  to be  negotiable  in India after  1847  without  a bill 
of lading  as guarantee, have allegedly been compelled  to appeal  to 
the Bank  for  help. This firm,  S. & S., are the  greatest skinflints 
and so easily scared that they'd rather  do no  business  at all  than 
run any  kind  of risk. 
Here things still look much  as they  did  before. Some  8 to 10 
days  ago  Indian  and  Levantine buyers suddenly appeared  in the 
market, procured what they wanted  at the  lowest prices  and  thus 
helped some manufacturers heavily overstocked with cotton, yarn 
and cloth  out of the  worst  of their predicament. Since Tuesday 
(Nov. 4th?a) everything  has  been quiet again.  As for the 
manufacturers their expenses  go on,  SHORT  time  AND FULL TIME,  coal 
and lubricants,  etc., etc.,  remain just  as before,  and  only  WAGES 
have been reduced  by Vs to '/2-  Moreover, nothing  is being sold, 
most  of our  SPINNERS  AND  MANUFACTURERS  are  getting very short  of 
FLOATING CAPITAL  and  many  of them  are  rotten  to the  core.  8 to 9 of 
the smaller ones have already come  a cropper  in the  past  few  days, 
but that  is only  the  first sign that  the  crisis  has  caught  up with this 
class.  Today  I heard that  the  Cookes,  who own the  huge factory  in 
Oxford Road (Oxford Road Twist Company), have sold their 
HUNTERS, FOXHOUNDS, GREYHOUNDS,  etc., etc., and that one of them has 
dismissed  his  servants  and  left  his  palace, which  is now  TO BE LET. 
They haven't gone bust  yet, but  will undoubtedly  be in for it  soon. 
Another fortnight,  and the  dance will really  be in  full swing here. 
Sewell's  and  Neck's failure will have serious repercussions  in 
Norway, which  has not  been affected hitherto. 
Things  in Hamburg look splendid. Ulberg  and  Cramer (Swe­
den),  whose debts when they failed amounted  to 12,000,000 banco 
marks  (of  which  7 mill, were bills  on themselves!),  had a  capital  of 
not more than 300,000 marks!!  A whole  lot of  chaps have  got  into 
hot water simply  for  want  of sufficient cash when  a single bill fell 
due, although they might have  had in  their desks  a hundred times 
that amount  in currently worthless bills. Never  has  panic assumed 
so perfect  and  classic  a form  as in  Hamburg just now. Everything  is

worthless, utterly worthless, save for silver and gold. Last week also 
saw the failure of Christ. Matth. Schröder, a very old and wealthy 
house. J. H. Schröder & Co., London (his brother), telegraphed 
saying that if 2 million banco marks would be enough, he would 
send the equivalent in silver. Came the reply: 3 millions or 
nothing. He couldn't spare the 3 millions and Christian Matthias 
crashed. 247 We have debtors in Hamburg and have no idea 
whether they still exist or whether they've gone bust. In Hamburg 
the whole imbroglio is the result of the most colossal kite-flying 
operations that have ever been seen. They were at their most 
outrageous in the dealings between Hamburg, London, 
Copenhagen and Stockholm. Then, with the American CRASH and 
the fall in the price of goods, the whole business came to light 
and, for the moment, Hamburg is done for commercially. The 
German industrialists, especially those in Berlin, Saxony and 
Silesia, will be very hard hit. 
Cotton is now 69/i6d for MIDDLING and will no doubt soon come 
down to 6d. But the mills here will only be able to go on full time 
again provided increased production does not promptly force the 
price above 6d. Yet that is what would immediately happen just 
now. 
Among our local philistines the crisis has induced a strong 
desire for the bottle. No one can bear to stay at home alone with 
his cares and his family. The clubs are livening up and the 
consumption of LIQUOR is rising sharply. The worse of a jam a chap 
is in, the more frenzied his efforts to cheer himself up. And then, 
the morning after, what more striking example of remorse, both 
alcoholic and moral! 
This week I shall again apply myself to the Cyclopaedia and do 
as many of the C articles as possible. Just now I can't work much 
or for very long at a stretch, but I'll do what I can. 
Warmest regards to your wife and children.

MARX  TO  ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  8 December  1857 
DEAR  Frederick, 
While  I was  upstairs busy writing  my  last letter  to you,a  my  wife 
down below  was  besieged  by  hungry wolves  all of  whom used  the 
PRETEXT  of the  HEAVY  TIMES-  to dun her for money which she had not 
got. (Luckily  £15  arrived from Germany  a few  days afterwards, 
thus enabling us  TO  SHIFT  OFF THE  EVIL  DAY FOR  A WEEK  OR A FORTNIGHT.) 
WELL,  in the  above-mentioned circumstances  I may  have been  a 
RATHER  confused correspondent,  but not too  confused  to recall  my 
confusion that self-same evening, after posting  the  letter,  and 
remark  to my  wife what  a wry  face  you  would pull  at my bit  about 
debtors receiving money  on  bills payable  by  themselves,  etc.  Ever 
since  I have been keeping  up her  spirits, which have been much 
depressed  by  this 'petite guerre'b with sundry scoundrels,  by 
reflecting  on how you  would break  it to me in the  most gracious 
possible  way. But I  could hardly  go so far as to  expect that  you 
would tone down the  RIDICULOUS BLUNDER  to a  SLIGHT MISTAKE.0  MY  BEST 
THANKS  FOR  THIS  GRACE,  SIR. 
But to return  to the  matter  in hand. According  to The  Economist 
it is true that  the  chaps  in Mincing Lane  and  Mark Laned  had 
again been receiving  LOANS  on their  PRODUCE,  but  this  MOVE  ceased last 
Wednesday  or  thereabouts. Corn,  in particular, even showed  an 
UPWARD  TENDENCY  for a day or two, but (flour actually) then dropped 
3/- per 280 lbs as a result of the  FRENCH  DECREES  permitting the 
free export  of corn  and  flour,  and  significandy  so  yesterday  as a 
result  of the  DOWNBREAK  of corn prices  in the  Baltic. (Nota bene:  In 
France, Bonaparte's measure  had no  more than  a transient effect; 
though prices rose  a little there,  the  rise immediately resulted  in 
INCREASED SUPPLIES,  which have still  to find their  way  on to the  French 
market.)  A few  corn merchants have failed here,  but as yet  only 
insignificant houses and then only  OPERATORS  UPON  GRAIN  FOR  DISTANT 
DELIVERY.  The big American  SHIPMENTS  arrive in the  SPRING;  the French 
will bombard England with corn  AT ANY PRICE  as soon  as PRESSURE  over

there grows  MORE SERIOUS.  In my  opinion—and always supposing 
that,  in accordance with  the old  adage, there  are  several good 
autumns  in succession—only  now  will  the  effects  of the  REPEAL  of 
the CORN LAWS  150 begin to tell on  LANDLORDS  and  FARMERS  in England 
and the  ANTIQUATED AGRICULTURAL  DISTRESS  recur in no mean fashion. 
The satisfactory state  of the  HOME TRADE  resulting from industrial 
PROSPERITY,  and the  succession  of bad  autumns have combined  to 
make  the  experiment  of 1847-57 inoperative  and  turn  REPEAL TO A 
DEAD  LETTER.248 
I've had a  gratifying experience with  the  Tribune.  On 6 
November  I wrote  an  exposé  for them  of the  1844  Bank Act, 132 in 
which  I said that  the  next  few  days would  see the  FARCE  of 
SUSPENSION,  but  that  not too  much should  be  made  of this  MONETARY 
PANIC,  the real affaire being the impending  INDUSTRIAL  CRASH  a The 
Tribune published this as a  LEADER.  3 DAYS LATER  The New-York Times 
(which  has  entered into  a feudal relationship with  the  London 
Times) replied  to the  Tribune  to the  effect that, firstly,  the  Bank 
Act would  not be  suspended, extolled  the Act  after  the  manner  of 
the MONEY-ARTICLE WRITERS  of Printing House Square,13 and declared 
the TALK  of an  'INDUSTRIAL CRASH'  in England to be  'SIMPLY ABSURD'.  This 
was on the  24th.  The  following  day the  N.Y.T.  received  a 
telegram from  the  Atlantic with  the  news that  the  Bank  Act had 
been suspended,  and  likewise news  of 'INDUSTRIAL DISTRESS'.  It's  nice,  by 
the by, to see  Loyd-Overstone coming  out  with  the  true reason  for 
his fanatical advocacy  of the  1844  legislation—because  it permit­
ted the  'HARD CALCULATORS'  to squeeze 20-30% out of the  COMMERCIAL 
WORLD 0 
Nice,  too,  that  the  capitalists,  who so  vociferously opposed  the 
'droit  au travail'," 1 are now  everywhere demanding 'public support' 
from their governments  and  hence advocating  the  'droit  au profit e 
at public expense  in Hamburg, Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen 
and even England  (in the  form  of  SUSPENSION  of the  Acts). Also, that 
the philistines  of Hamburg should have refused  to hand  out any 
more alms  to the  capitalists. 
The astonishing thing about  the  whole business  is the  affaire  in 
France  and the  attitude adopted towards  it by  most  of the  English 
press.  Just  as,  after  the  American  COLLAPSE,  John Bull  was 
represented as the calm,  SELF-POSSESSED MERCHANT  vis-à-vis his brother 
a K. Marx,  'The  English Bank  Act of 1844 and the  Monetary Crisis  in England'.

Jonathan, so now Jacques Bonhomme vis-à-vis John Bull. The 
Paris correspondent of the London Economist comments most 
ingenuously: 
•'There has been not the slightest disposition to have a panic, though 
circumstances certainly appeared to justify one, and though the French have 
heretofore been extremely ready to rush into panics on the smallest pretexts.'*3 
The PANIC now felt by the French bourgeoisie, despite their 
sanguine temperament, at the very notion of panic, is surely the 
best indication of what panic means in France on this occasion. 
The virtuous disposition of the Parisian bourgeois will, however, 
prove no more effective than the Hamburg ASSOCIATION FOR 
DISCOUNTING THE PANIC.249  Last Sunday's Observer relates how the 
dissemination of horrible rumours about the Crédit mobilier 45 sent 
everyone rushing to the Bourse to rid themselves à tout prix h of 
their SHARES. French capital, despite the cosmopolitan nature therein 
descried by Mr Péreire, is still timid, niggardly and cautious in 
actual COMMERCE as it has always been. Crooked dealing (which, to 
be sure, has IN  ITS TURN become the sine qua non of respectable  trade 
and industry) actually exists only in branches in which the State is 
the real  EMPLOYER,  whether directly or indirectly. But there is no 
doubt that even an inherently—or, as Hegel would say, 'in 
himself—bankrupt capitalist of the magnitude of the French 
GOVERNMENT can make SHIFT for rather longer than a  PRIVATE  CAPITALIST. 
The police measures against BULLION  EXPORTS,  now pretty well IN  FULL 
VIGOR in France, and to an even greater extent the export,  AT WHICH 
PRICES  WHATEVER, of the products of the corn, silk and wine harvests, 
etc., have put off for a week or two the drain of BULLION from the 
Bank of France. Nevertheless, THE DRAIN  WILL  SET  IN and even if, as in 
1856 (October), it gets no further than the gutter, the catastrophe 
will be complete. Meanwhile French manufacturers are treating 
their workers as ruthlessly as though there had never been a 
revolution. THIS WILL  DO GOOD.  On the other hand Mr Bonaparte is 
using the bank as an entrepreneur for the construction of 
railways, now at a standstill. Doubtless the next step will be the 
issue of assignats c as soon as the DRAIN begins. If the fellow has the 
courage, and always providing he can pay the army properly, we 
may yet witness a pretty prologue. 
Your information about conditions in Manchester is of the 
greatest interest to me, the newspapers having chosen to draw a 
veil over them.

NEWS  OF THE  MORNING STAR,  a name that bears a certain analogy with

every  day,  even without German assistance. Quite apart from  the 
seismic effects  of the  GENERAL CRISIS  which must delight every 
connoisseur,  it is  truly  a relief when  one is no  longer forced  to 
listen every day to the  ENGLISH SELF-LAUDATIONS AS  TO THE BRAVERY' OF THEIR

overtrading  in other people's courage  on the  part  of the  English

uncommonly averse  to anything threatening  him  with  the  remotest 
chance  of obtaining military glory*.

In haste,  a few  more particulars about  the  crisis.  In Hamburg, 
where  the  crisis  has  been grossly exacerbated  by the  pedantry  of 
a Literally:  'a grove from  not  being light'.  The  expression, first used  by Quintilian  in 
De institutione oratoria  (I, 6, 34),  illustrates  the  practice ascribed  to ancient Roman 
etymologists  of deriving words from their semantic opposites,  as lucus  ('grove')  from 
lucere  ('to  shine,  be light') because  a grove  is not  light. Marx means that despite  its 
name  The  Morning Star  is rather unilluminating.  - •> Literally: always partridge. 
Here: always  the  same thing.  The  phrase  is attributed  to the  confessor  of King Henry 
IV of France.

the old and much-famed clearing bank, this is what has happened: 
Schunck, Souchay & Co. here had drawn bills on Hamburg. So as 
to be really on the safe side, and although the bills were on goods, 
etc., etc., they sent the drawees BANK  OF ENGLAND SEVEN DAY BILLS. 
These were indignantly returned  AS  SO MUCH  WASTE  PAPER,  and the bills 
drawn on Hamburg duly protested with the comment that only 
silver now had any value! Bills bearing the endorsements of 
Schunck, Souchay & Co. and 2 other equally good houses, 
maturing in 2 months, could not be discounted last week at less 
than 12/2 per cent. 
NB. If I give you the names of the houses concerned, it is on 
the understanding that this remains strictly between ourselves. I 
could get into the devil of a row if such an abuse of confidential 
information were to come to light. 
The Liverpool and London PRODUCE houses will come a cropper 
before long. Things look grim in Liverpool; the chaps are stone 
broke and can't even summon up the energy to go bankrupt, 
while at the Exchange, or so I am told by someone who was there 
on Monday, faces are three times as long as they are here, though 
here too the storm clouds are growing steadily darker. Spinners 
and manufacturers are paying wages and buying coal with the 
money they get in for their goods and when that's gone they're 
sure to collapse. Yesterday the market was more listless and 
depressed than it had ever been before. 
Someone told me he knew of 5 or 6 Indian houses whose stocks 
are such that they cannot fail to go to the wall in the very near 
future. 
Only now are the fellows beginning to realise that the monetary 
speculation was the least important factor in the crisis, and the 
more they see this, the gloomier they look. 
Health good. More tomorrow or the day after. Herewith a 
bundle of Guardians. Take a look at the little bits of local news, in 
which you'll find some very interesting facts.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 11 December 1857 
Dear Moor, 
Still VERY BUSY with bad debts and price reductions. 
Never before has overproduction been so general as during the 
present crisis, and there's no denying that this applies to colonial 
produce and also to corn. That's what's so splendid, and is bound 
to have tremendous consequences. After all, so long as over­
production was confined to industry the thing was only half-way 
there, but as soon as agriculture is also affected, and in the tropics 
as well as in the temperate zone, it will become spectacular. 
The outward and visible sign of overproduction is more or less 
always expansion of credit, but this time it's especially kite-flying: 
This system of making money by means of drafts on bankers or 
'bill-brokers', which are either met or not before maturity 
according to how the thing has been arranged, is the rule on the 
Continent and among the continental houses in England. The 
commission houses here all do it. The system was taken to the 
most enormous lengths in Hamburg, where bills amounting to 
more than 100 million banco marks were in circulation. But there 
was some fearful kite-flying elsewhere and it was because of this 
that Sieveking, Sillam, Karr, Josling & Co., Draper, Pietroni & Co. 
and other London houses went under. For the most part they 
were the drawees in this LINE. Among the manufacturing businesses 
over here and in the HOME TRADE the thing was so arranged that 
instead of paying  CASH IN A MONTH  the fellows negotiated bills on 
themselves at 3 months and paid the interest. In silk 
manufacturing the practice increased proportionately to the rise in 
the price of silk. In short everyone operated in excess of his 
resources,  OVERTRADED.  Admittedly OVERTRADING is not synonymous 
with overproduction,- but it amounts to exactly the same thing. A 
MERCANTILE COMMUNITY which has a capital of £20,000,000 thereby 
possesses an ability to produce, trade and consume measured by 
this sum. If, on this capital and as a result of kite-flying, it does 
business presupposing a capital of £30,000,000, production will 
rise by 50% and consumption will also rise as a result of

114. Engels to Marx. 11 December 1857 221 
prosperity, but by no means to the same degree, disons* 25%. At 
the end of a certain period there will inevitably be an accumula­
tion of goods of an order 25% in excess of bona fide, i.e. of 
average requirements, even at a time of  prosperity.  This alone would 
be bound to precipitate the crisis, even if the money market, the 
weathercock of trade, were not already pointing in that direction. 
All that's needed is a CRASH and then, in addition to this 25%, a 
further 25% at least of STOCKS of all  NECESSARIES  will become  A DRUG  ON 
THE MARKET. The present crisis provides an opportunity for a 
detailed study of how overproduction is generated by the 
expansion of credit and by OVERTRADING. There's nothing new about 
the thing as such, save for the remarkably clear-cut lines along 
which it is now developing. In 1837-42 and 1847 they were by no 
means so clear-cut. 
That is the pretty situation in which Manchester and the cotton 
industry now find themselves. Prices are low enough to permit of 
what the philistines call  A SOUND  BUSINESS.  But as soon as there is the 
slightest increase in production, cotton will start going up, since 
there's none to be had in Liverpool. So they'll have to carry on 
working  SHORT  TIME,  orders or no orders. Now admittedly there are 
orders, but they're from places that have not yet felt the intensity of the 
crisis; the commission houses know this and so they aren't buying, 
for to do so would involve endless wrangles, and bad debts into 
the bargain. 
Today the market was again very depressed. Yarn worth 14 to 
14'/2cl is offered at ll'/^d and anyone offering 103/4d can have it. 
The Indians are out of the market. The Greeks are stuck with 
their corn—almost all of them deal in this, it being their chief 
return freight (from Galatz and Odessa). The Germans can't buy 
for the reasons just mentioned. The HOME TRADE houses have 
forbidden their BUYERS to order anything at all. AMERICA OUT  OF THE 
QUESTION. Italy is suffering from the general fall in price of her raw 
materials. Another month, and there'll be a very nasty situation 
here.  Small spinners and manufacturers are going under every 
day. 
Mercks in Hamburg only survived because of the 15 mill, 
advance from the government and on one day at least their house 
here sent away the spinners whose accounts were due. Mercks' 
head man in Hamburg is the ex-imperial minister Dr Ernst Merck, 
a lawyer but also partner.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 17 December 1857 
Dear Marx, 
This crisis is keeping me hellishly en haleine.h Prices falling every 
day. Moreover we ourselves are already beginning to feel it. My 
old man was in a fix not long ago and we had to advance him 
money. However I don't imagine that it will prove serious, but 
that's neither here nor there just now. 
Manchester is becoming ever more deeply involved. The effect 
of the constant pressure on the market is really tremendous. 
Nobody can sell anything. Every day we hear of lower offers, and 
anyone with a sense of the proprieties stops offering his goods for 
sale.  Things look grim among the spinners and manufacturers. 
Yarn agents are no longer selling to factories except for CASH or 
against security. A few of the smaller people have already come a 
cropper but that's nothing compared with what's in store.252 
Despite two substantial subventions, Mercks are in a complete 
fix, both here and in Hamburg. They are expected to go under 
any day, and only an extraordinary fluke could save them. The 
capital of the Hamburg house is said to total 4 to 5 million banco 
marks against LIABILITIES of 22 million (13 inarks=£l). According to 
other reports the crisis has already whittled down the capital to 
600,000 marks.

We shall have  4 more distinct crises:  1. colonial produce, 
2. corn, 3. spinners and manufacturers, 4.  HOME  TRADE—this  not 
before next spring.  In the  woollen districts things  are  already 
beginning,  and  very nicely  too. 
Don't forget  to make  a note  of the  BALANCE-SHEETS  of the  firms 
that have failed—Bennoch, Twentyman, Reed  of Derby, Mendes 
da Costa, Hoare, Buxton,  etc. All of  them most edifying. 
Your views  on  France have since been borne  out by the 
newspapers almost  to the  letter. There  is sure  to be a  CRASH over 
there  and the  first  to be  involved will  be the  speculators  of central 
and northern Germany. 
You will presumably have made  a note  of the  proceedings 
relating  to Macdonald, Monteith, Stevens (London  and  Exchange 
Bank). 3 The  story  of the  London  and  Exchange Bank  and the 
BORROWED  NOTES  counting  as SECURITY  is the  most splendid  I have ever 
read. 
Apart from Hamburg, northern Germany  has  hitherto hardly 
been drawn into  the  crisis  at all. But it's  beginning there  now too. 
Heimendahl (silk doubler  and merchant)  has  gone under  in 
Elberfeld,  and  Linde  & Trappenberg (SMALL WARE MANUFACTURERS)  in 
Barmen. Both respectable firms.  So far the  north Germans have 
suffered virtually nothing  but  losses;  in their case,  as over here, 
the temporary disruption  of the  money market  has a  less severe 
effect than  the  protracted period over which goods have been 
unsaleable. 
Vienna's turn will also come. 
Lupus  is eating humble  pie; we  were right. 
Distress  has  also begun  to set in  among  the  proletariat. There 
are as yet few  signs  of revolution,  for the  long period  of 
prosperity  has  been fearfully demoralising.  The  unemployed  on 
the streets continue  to beg and to  idle away their time. ROBBERIES  by 
garrotters  are on the  increase,  but not to any  serious extent. 
I now  have  to do so  much running round seeing people  in 
order  to keep track  of the  crisis that there's damned little time left 
to do any  work  for  Dana. That,  too,  must  be attended  to in the 
intervals. What  has he to  say?  And how are his  payments going?

MARX  TO  ENGELS 20 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  18  December  1857 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Just a few  lines written  in great haste.  I've  just received  a 3rd 
and final warning from  the  rotten rate collector  to the  effect that, 
if I haven't paid  by  Monday, they'll  put a  BROKER  in the  house  on 
Monday afternoon.  IF  possible,  THEREFORE,  send  me a few  pounds 
before Monday. Financial  PRESSURE  is now  even greater than  is 
USUALLY  the  case with  me  because,  for  ABOUT  3 weeks,  I have  had to 
pay for everything in cash and  ANYTHING LIKE CREDIT  has ceased, while 
' at the  same time  /$ of all the  money  I receive immediately goes  to 
meet floating  DEBTS.  Moreover, there  is only  a very little coming  in, 
since  I have hitherto been unable  to send  the  Tribune more than 
one article.b So  FAR AS TO  PRIVATE MATTERS. 
I am  working enormously,  as a  rule until  4 o'clock  in the 
morning.  I am  engaged  on a  twofold task:  1. Elaborating  the 
outlines  of political economy.250  (For the  benefit  of the  public  it is 
absolutely essential  to go  into  the  matter aufondf  as it is for my  own, 
INDIVIDUALLY,  TO GET RID OF  THIS NIGHTMARE.) 
2. The  present crisis. Apart from  the  articles  for the  Tribune,  all 
I do is  keep records  of it,which, however, takes  up a  considerable 
amount  of  time.  I think that, somewhere  ABOUT  the  spring,  we 
ought  to do a  pamphlet together about  the  affair253  as a  reminder 
to the  German public that  we are  still there  as always,  and  ALWAYS 
THE SAME.  I have started 3 large record  books—ENGLAND,  GERMANY, 
FRANCE.  All the  material  on the  American affair  is available  in the

Tribune, and can be collated subsequently. By the by, I should be 
glad if you would send me the Guardian, if possible, every day. It 
not only doubles the work but also disrupts it if I have to deal with 
a week or so's arrears all at once. 
In France, and specially at Havre,' the fun (commercial) will 
probably be started by the 'Germans', whom one cannot altogether 
help taking into account now. Moreover—apart from the GENERAL 
ROTTENNESS of the bankrupt State—trade itself would seem to be 
exceptionally rotten in Marseilles and Bordeaux, everywhere, that 
is, where infiltration and intervention by foreign elements has 
stung the beasdy crapauds* 1 out of their lousy, mean penny-
pinching and TIMIDITY. Au fond, h only in such an immobile coun­
try was a Crédit mobilier 45 both possible and inevitable. THE 
MORE YOU BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE  MESSIAS  OF NATIONS', THE LESS YOU 
LIKE HIM. 
Write to me whenever you have the time, for later on you're 
sure to forget all the 'chronique scandaleuse' of the crisis which is so 
invaluable to us. I make excerpts from your letters and enter them 
in the principal record books. 
Salut. Kind regards to Lupus. Pieper has the satisfaction of 
knowing that his ex-principal Saalfeld, with whose wife he had 
such a tremendous row, HAS  GONE  TO THE WALL.

well be committed to paper, did not present  itself.  I would point 
out, by the by, that it was you who first broke off the 
correspondence by failing for such a long time to answer a letter 
dated Manchester.3 
MY THANKS  FOR Heraclitus.b I have always felt a great TENDERNESS for 
this philosopher, whom I prefer above all the Ancients save 
Aristotle. [Later]c philosophy—Epicurus (him in particular), Stoa 
and Scepticism — [I] had made the object of special study,d but for 
[political] rather than philosophical [...] reasons. While [tendering] 
my thanks, [I] must at the same time [say] that the work has not 
yet reached me. 
Doubtless [Nutt's] will send it as soon as it comes into their [...] 
[...] to write [... Ministry. My views on Palmerston you know, 
and these have not changed. Besides, I know nothing whatever 
about the paper6 since Austrian journals are nowhere on display 
here,  and am thus quite ignorant of its general line. Whatever the 
case,  I should be interested to see one or two numbers.254 
I live in great isolation here, all my friends except Freiligrath 
having left London. Anyway, I have no desire for intercourse. 
Relativement parlant,' Freiligrath is doing quite well as MANAGER of 
the Swiss Bank and is still the same good-natured, sterling fellow 
he has always been. Lupus and Engels are in Manchester as 
before. We still lament the loss of Weerth. 
The present commercial crisis has impelled me to set to work 
seriously on my outlines of political economy,250 and also to 
prepare something on the present crisis. I am forced to fritter 
away [...] my days earning a living. [Only] the nights remain free 
for real work and that is disrupted by ill-health. I [have] not

living as I do like a hermit. Throughout last winter and summer

MARX TO ENGELS 20 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 22 December 1857 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Thou hast triumphantly snatched me out of the clutches of the 
Exchequer, praised be thy name—halleluiah! 
Herewith a letter (with enclosure) from the great Lassalle 254 who 
now positively assures me that he is SERIOUSLY beginning to be 
known in Berlin by reason of his fame. These EFFUSIONS of a 
beautiful soul will amuse you and Lupus. The worthy Lassalle took 
up philosophy and Heraclitus a as he took up the Hatzfeldt case35 
and, if he is to be believed, eventually won his 'case'. It would, 
indeed, seem that the old school—both philologists and 
Hegelians—were surprised to see such a posthumous blossoming of 
a by-gone epoch. But we shall be seeing the thing for ourselves 
and, gift-horse or no, shall look it long and searchingly in the 
mouth—ON  THE  EXPRESS  CONDITION, OF  COURSE,  that Heraclitus doesn't 
reek of garlic. * Fancy only this fellow going up and down the 
streets of Berlin and 'asking for himself strutting like a peacock, a 
stride and a stand: biting his lips, with 'a political regard' as who 
should say: 'This is the man who has written Heraclit.'* The 
laddie might be of some service to us in finding a publisher, 
unless, perhaps, he's afraid that competition might endanger the 
reputation to which he also aspires in the field of economics, 
thereby losing him his 'case'. I have replied to Friedländer

through Mr Lassalle saying that, while I, too, am 'anti-French', I 
am no less 'anti-English', and that the last thing I could do would 
be to write in favour of 'Lord Pam'. So I have turned the thing 
down. Should Friedländer send me the Presse so that I can see 
beforehand whose spiritual offspring it is, and if the fellows want 
no more than one MONEY  ARTICLE  a week—for which they would, of 
course, have to shell out—I might perhaps agree. There can be 
no question of POLITICS in this CASE. 
I have written to Lassalle, brief and cool, to say that, while I had 
received the letter sent through Freiligrath, I hadn't answered it 
for reasons that could hardly be committed to paper. For the rest 
a few words, no more.' 
Schramm has written to my wife from Jersey; an extremely witty 
letter. For his sins, Kosmos Leiden has lost 3 of his children; 2 
daughters (including Mrs Mevissen) died of consumption and one 
of his sons went down with the Pacific. 
In last Sunday's issue of Reynold's there is a significant attack 
upon those APOSTATES who advocate UNION with the MIDDLE CLASS. 
Meaning Jones. I haven't seen the laddie for a long time. He 
seems to be avoiding me, for which he must have his 'raysons'. 
However, I shall probably surprise him—ONE FINE MORNING.

DEAR  Frederick,

COMMERCE, INDUSTRY AND CRISES  and  reached certain conclusions which  I 
shall briefly oudine  for you: 
1. English, North European  and  American crises have never 
directly given rise  in France  to a  'French crisis'; rather  the  effects 
have been entirely passive—chronic  DISTRESS, LIMITATION OF PRODUCTION, 
STAGNATION  OF TRADE,  and  GENERAL  UNEASINESS.  The reason: France has a 
favourable balance  of trade with  the  United States,  the  HANSEATIC 
TOWNS,  England, Denmark. With Sweden  and  Norway  the  balance 
is unfavourable,  but  this  is  more than offset  by  Hamburg. 
CONSEQUENTLY  these crises  can  never generate  a DRAIN  OF BULLION  from 
France  and  hence will  not  create  A PROPERLY SO-CALLED MONETARY PANIC 
there.  If the  Bank, notwithstanding, increases  the  bank rate,  as has 
happened this time,  it does  so  merely  to prevent  the  capitalists 
from placing their money more advantageously  in those countries. 
But so  long  as the  EXPORT  OF BULLION  is the  inevitable consequence, 
not of the  balance  of  trade  but  simply  of the  avarice  of the 
PROFITMONGERS,  it can, as  Bonaparte  has now  once more demon­
strated,  be  stopped  by the  gendarmerie.  If the  country with  the 
favourable balance  of trade  has not  granted long-term credits  or 
ACCUMULATED  PRODUCE  FOR THE  EXPORT  TO THE  CENTRES  OF THE  CRISES—and  both 
are repugnant  to the  PEDLAR-likea nature  of your French manufac­
turer  and  merchant—it will have  to endure losses,  etc.,  but not an 
acute crisis. Louis Philippe,  too, was  misled  by the  apparent good 
fortune with which France emerges from  the  first phase  of a 
GENERAL CRISIS.  In his  inaugural address before  the  Chambers  on the 
eve of the  February revolution,  he  congratulated  'la  belle France' 
UPON  THIS PRIVILEGE. 
2. Admitting  all  this,  the  first phase  of the  crisis  has  already 
affected  FRENCH INDUSTRY  and  COMMERCE  more seriously than  on any 
similar occasion  in the  past. 
3. In  France  the  first effect  of the  crisis—AGREEABLE TO THE  NATURE 
OF THE  crapaud 81—is  the  timorous curtailment  of  EXPENDITURE  and 
BUSINESS.  Hence  an  accumulation  of money  in the  Bank  of France 
coinciding with  a huge drop  in the  circulation  of  BANK DISCOUNTS. 
Hence—owing  to the  circumstance that crises always happen  in 
the autumn  and  that every French government fears political 
disturbances  at the  year's  end  should  the  bank rate  be high  at the 
SETTLEMENT  of ACCOUNTS—reduction  of the  bank rate  in December. 
In December  1847  Louis Philippe ordered  the  Bank  to reduce  the 
bank rate  to 4%. 
a Marx used  the word 'pedlarmassig'  here,  formed  of the English word 'pedlar'  and 
the German  'massig'  meaning 'after  the  fashion  of. 

=====第264页=====
230 119. Marx  to Engels.  25 December  1857 
4. The  greater availability  of capital  in  COMMERCE  and  industry 
simultaneously gives rise  to greater  BUOYANCY  on the  Bourse. This 
has been  the  case under Boustrapa40  to an  even greater extent 
than under Louis Philippe because  he compelled  the  Bank  by the 
Decree of 1852 to make  ADVANCES  ON  RAILWAY SECURITIES  and fonds* 
and Crédit foncier papiers,  to rediscount  the  speculative  BILLS 
discounted  by the  Comptoir National d'escompte, 255 and  likewise 
to make  him a  further advance  on the  SECURITIES  on  which 
that institution  had  made advances already. Hence,  e.g. the  high 
price of French  RAILWAY SHARES  and  BONDS  although the  RECEIPTS  of 
the French railways since  the  outbreak  of the  crises  in England 
have fallen disproportionately more than those over here.  E.g. 
Orleans Railway  RECEIPTS  dropped  by 24%  between  29  October 
and 26  November  and  subsequently even further. Nevertheless 
on 22  December Orleans Railway  was  quoted  at 1,355  whereas 
on 29  October  it was at  2,985. b It also emerges from  the  MONTHLY 
REPORT  of the  BANK  OF FRANCE  for December that, while  DISCOUNTS  in 
December have dropped  by  94,236,520  frs  compared with Octo­
ber and 49,955,500 compared with November,  ADVANCES  ON  RAIL­
WAY SECURITIES  have risen.c 
5. The  French crisis proper does  not  break  out  until  the  GENERAL 
CRISIS  has  attained  a certain level  in  Holland, Belgium,  the 
Zollverein, 256 Italy (including Trieste),  the  Levant  and  Russia 
(Odessa), because  in  these countries  the  balance  of  trade  is 
distinctly unfavourable  to  France; hence  the  direct effect  of PRESSURE 
is MONETARY PANIC  in France. Once it has hit France, it recoils on 
those countries d'une manière vraiment admirable^ With Switzerland, 
France  is on the  same footing  as the  United States with England. 
The short-term balance  of trade  is consistently  in France's favour. 
But since France  is substantially  in debt  to Switzerland,  the  latter  is 
always apt  HEAVILY  TO DRAW UPON  IT in times of crisis. 
6. When  the  French crisis proper breaks  out, it  will play  the 
very devil both with the  SECURITY MARKET  and the  SECURITY  of that 
market,  the  State. (This will also  TELL UPON  England, which  AT THE 
a stocks  - b See  'Bourse  du Jeudi  26 novembre 1857',  Le Moniteur  universel,

shares  of the  Bank  of France. The corresponding figure  for  Orleans Railways  is 1,300, 
which bears out Marx's argument  on the buoyancy  of railway stock.  - c 'Situation  de la

PRESENT  MOMENT  is again gambling in  FOREIGN SECURITIES  in a manner 
splendid  to behold.)  The  swindling, which  in Hamburg, England, 
the United States has been the province of  PRIVATE CAPITALISTS,  is 
practised  in France  by the  State  itself,  and the  French  PEDLARS IN 
TRADE  were all of them  GAMBLERS  on the Bourse. The  RECOIL  from the 
Anglo-American crisis sufficed  to bring  the  railways  TO A DEADLOCK. 
What does  Mr  Bonaparte  do?  Compels  the  Bank  TO BECOME IN FACT [AJ 
RAILWAY  CONTRACTOR  and to make advances to the fellows on the  BONDS 
they were authorised to  ISSUE  by the  SETTLEMENT  of 30 November 
1856.  In 1858 these  BONDS  will run to  ABOUT  £9 million. Thus the 
Crédit mobilier, 45 which  on 3  December  was up to its  ears  in 
trouble,  is preparing  to amalgamate with  the  Crédit fonder  and 
the Comptoir National d'escompte. Why? Because both  the  latter 
are legally entitled  to  receive  ADVANCES  from  the  Bank  on  their 
SECURITIES  and to have, their  DISCOUNTS REDISCOUNTED.  So Boustrapa's 
plan is clear, namely  to make  the  BANK OF FRANCE  the  entrepreneur 
for all his  fraudulent schemes with  the  help,  not of its  own  capital, 
but of the  capital which  it has  merely  on  deposit  and  which will 
drain away  ON THE  FIRST  SIGNAL GIVEN  IN THE  NEIGHBOURING  COUNTRIES.  IN FACT, 
this is also  an  admirable  way of  ruining  the  Bank. However  it 
would hardly occur even  to Mr  Bona  to  have  the  CALLS  of the 
SHAREHOLDERS  paid by the  BANK  OF FRANCE.  In 1858 these  CALLS  will 
amount  to over  £10  million  for  French railways alone under  the 
SETTLEMENT  of 30  November  1856.  They will  run to at  least  £30 
million for the host of speculative concerns  SUCH  AS the  MERCANTILE 
AND INDUSTRIAL  CO OF  MADRID  (Rothschilds), the French-American 
Shipping Company,  the  Victor Emmanuel Railway, Herserange 
Ironworks  Co.,  Austrian Railways, Saragossa  Co.,  French-Swiss 
Railway,  LAUSANNE-FRIBOURG RAILWAY, NASSAU COMPANY,  Société Générale 
des Tanneries, Compagnie  de la  Carbonisation  des  Houilles,  CHIMAY 
TO MARIENBOURG RAILWAY,  Lombard-Venetian  RAILWAY,  South American

paying these  CALLS.  Moreover the  GERMANS, HOLLANDERS, SWISS,  the  LARGE 
HOLDERS  OF FRIENCH] SECURITIES,  will sell them  AT ANY  PRICE  on the Paris 
Bourse at the first sign of  SERIOUS ALARM,  be it in France or due to 
PRESSURE AT HOME.  SO it seems that Boustrapa will hardly  be  able  to 
extricate himself  in 1858  unless  he holds  out for  a bit longer with  the 
help  of martial  law  and  assignats.*  The  whole rotten  old  structure  is 
falling  to pieces  and the  ludicrously rash surge hitherto manifested 
a Paper money issued  by the  French revolutionary government  in 17H9: withdrawn  in 
1797.

As regards  the  Comptoir National d'escompte  de  Paris,  be it  also 
noted that this institution, which  was set up by the  provisional 
government  for the  purpose  of making bills discountable  on the 
basis  of only  two  signatures  and  similar less stringent require­
ments,  was  empowered  by  Boustrapa  in 1851, only  a day or two 
after  the  coup d'état,  TO MAKE ADVANCES ON  Rentes Françaises,  les  actions 
et obligations industrielles  ou de  crédit constituées  en  sociétés anonymes. 11 
Advances  on  these  SECURITIES  amounted  to £940,000  in 1854/55  and 
nearly £1,500,000  in 1855/56. Moreover,  in 1851  it was  given  the 
right  TO ESTABLISH  un 'Sous Comptoir  des  Chemins  de  Fer', h whose sole 
BUSINESS  was to make advances on  RAILWAY SHARES  and  BONDS.  At the 
end of  JUNE  1852 its  ADVANCES  were £520,000, at the end of 
1852 £1,240,000, 1852/53—£3,600,000;  at the end of 1854: 
£4,560,000, i.e.  ABOUT  9xthe  ADVANCES  in 1851. It's the same 
delectable business that broke  the  neck  of the  Scotch Exchange 
Banks  in  1846/47.

IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 31 December 1857 
Dear Moor, 
I have searched the whole town for newspapers containing 
INDIAN NEWS, having sent you my Guardians on the subject the day 
before yesterday. I can't get hold of the relevant numbers, either 
from the Guardian itself or from the Examiner & Times, nor has 
Belfield any left. I thought you had already dealt with this affair 
on Tuesday. In the circumstances I cannot do the article,b which is 
a In reply to this request Engels wrote the article 'The Siege and Storm of 
Lucknow'. - b The article in question, 'The Siege and Storm of Lucknow', was written 
later and published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 30 January 1858. In it Engels 
used some of the ideas expressed in this letter. 

=====第268页=====
234 121. Engels to Marx. 31 December 1857 
all the more vexing in that this is the first afternoon in 4 weeks on 
which I'd have been able to do it without having to neglect urgent 
business. In future, let me know as early as possible what your 
intentions are as to military articles; just now 24 hours makes quite 
a difference to me. 
In any case, detailed information is so frightfully scarce, what 
there is being based almost wholly on telegraphic despatches from 
Cawnpore to Calcutta, that it's virtually impossible to write a 
critical analysis.288 The only points I can think of are these: It is 40 
MILES from Cawnpore to Lucknow (Alam Bagh)—Havelock's forced 
marches show that in India 15 miles a day over a protracted 
period is a very long march. Accordingly, with only 2-3 marches 
ahead of him, Colina ought to have arrived at Alam Bagh no later 
than the 3rd day after his departure from Cawnpore, WITH  PLENTY  OF 
DAYLIGHT STILL LEFT TO ATTACK AT ONCE. It is by these standards that 
Colin's march must be judged; I can no longer recall the dates. 
2. He had, after all, some 7,000 men (far more had been counted 
on, so between Calcutta and Cawnpore the march must have gone 
atrociously badly and a great many men been lost) and if he beat 
the Oudhi with approximately 7,000 men (including the garrisons 
of Alam Bagh and Lucknow), it was no great feat. *An army of 
5-7,000 Englishmen has always been thought fully sufficient to go 
anywhere and do anything in the open field in India. That stamps 
the opponents at once.* A further consideration is that the Oudhi, 
although the most warlike race of the Ganges valley, were greatly 
inferior to the Sepoys as regards discipline, cohesion, weapons, 
etc., etc., precisely because they had never come under direct 
European organisation. Hence the main battle took the form of *a 
running fight, that is to say a skirmishing engagement in which 
the Oudhians were pushed back from post to post. Now it is true 
the British are, with the Russians, the worst light infantry in 
Europe, but they have learnt something in the Crimea, and at all 
events they had this great advantage over the Oudhians that their 
line of skirmishers was properly and regularly supported by 
pickets and lines the whole under one individual commander and 
cooperating towards a single end; while their opponents in the 
normal Asiatic manner, dispersed in irregular clusters, everyone 
pressing to the front, thus offering a sixfold aim to the British, 
having no regular supports or reserves and each cluster com­
manded by its own clannish  chief,  acting independently of every 
other clan. For it must be repeated, up to now we have not heard 
3 Colin Campbell

in a single instance that any insurrectionary army in India had 
been properly constituted under a recognized  chief.*  No other 
indication as to the nature of the fighting is given in the 
despatches nor, for that matter, any description of the terrain or 
particulars about the employment of troops, so that it's absolutely 
impossible for me to say anything further (let alone from 
memory). 
As to France, you are right IN EVERY PARTICULAR, so far as I can 
judge. There, too, things have taken a normal course up till now. 
Over here the affair is in its infancy so far as HOME TRADE is 
concerned; it is to this category that the two London houses in the 
Manchester TRADE belong. But that's only a beginning. This kind of 
firm can only become seriously embroiled when the pressure has 
lasted for 8-12 months. The course of the present crisis would 
seem to me to have more affinity with that of 1837-42 than with 
any other—if one disregards the splendid universality and 
all-embracing nature of the present one. Just now people here are 
deluding themselves into thinking that THE  CRISIS  IS OVER  because the 
first phase, the monetary crisis with its immediate consequences, is 
over. AM  fond 3 each individual bourgeois still believes that his 
particular branch of business, and notably his own business, has 
been THOROUGHLY  SOUND  and, being able to measure themselves aga­
inst the STANDARD of such splendid swindlers as Monteith, Macdo-
nald, etc., etc., they naturally imagine themselves to be uncom­
monly virtuous. Nevertheless, this will not compensate Mr. Troost 
for losing 2/3 to 3/4  of his fortune on his 35,000 sacks of 
coffee, nor Mr SENATOR Merck for the fact that his shipments and 
other such operations to the tune of 22 million banco marks will 
eat up the whole of his capital. John Pondu, a Scot who has shot 
up here like a gigantic mushroom over the past 5 years, has, 
together with 5 others, 7,000 bales of silk in transit on which the 
loss will be £300,000. All this will not come to a head until March 
or April, and the tremendous efforts to push up prices on the 
commodity market will be frustrated at regular intervals as vessels 
arrive. It would seem that icy weather and east winds are at 
present preventing ships from arriving here. Should this continue 
for a week or a fortnight, the price of all produce will 
undoubtedly rise, only to fall all the more precipitously as soon as 
a west wind brings in an entire fleet. Voilà ce qui s'appelle l'offre et la 
demande en temps de cm«. b STOCKS of cotton, too, are beginning to 
pile up in Liverpool—400,000 bales by today's count,  A RATHER  MORE 
a at heart - b That's what supply and demand is like in time of crisis.

THAN  AVERAGE  STOCK.  There's still better to come and COTTON is sure to 
fall again in the spring; it has just risen i l?d because de Jersey & 
Co.—a local firm which supplies almost the whole of the Russian 
market—having heard last week that their cancellation of all the 
orders they had placed in America had duly arrived—went and 
bought about 6,000 bales in Liverpool. That livened up the 
market, and any spinners who could afford to do so went in and 
bought something so as to supply their needs at the low prices. 
This alarmed, or rather put heart into, some other houses here 
and they, too, bought yarn and cloth so as to come in at the 
'bottom'. It won't last long; to start with we shall, I think, have 
moderate  UPS AND DOWNS  here, the tendency being generally down­
ward, perhaps also rising a little—one can't say exacdy—until 
somewhere or other the lightning strikes again. At all events, 
there's a bad year ahead for spinners and manufacturers, if only 
because of insufficient demand and excessive supply. Stagnating 
pressure—that is the greatest danger so far as our local bourgeois 
are concerned. Monetary crises are of small account here, since all 
credits are extremely short-term (2-6 weeks). 
On Saturday I went fox-hunting—7 hours in the saddle. That 
sort of thing always keeps me in a state of devilish exhilaration for 
several days; it's the greatest physical pleasure I know. I saw only 
2 out of the whole FIELD who were better horsemen than  myself, 
but then they were also better mounted. This will really put my 
health to rights. At least 20 of the chaps fell off or came down, 
2 horses were done for, 1 fox killed (I was in AT THE  DEATH);  otherwise 
no mishaps. Admittedly there were no real fox-hunters at the 
meet; they ride far better than I do, of course. I shall pass your 
thing on to Lupus. 
And now, a happy New Year to all your family and to the year 
of strife 1858.

As to C, I am IN  FACT  in a considerable quandary. Nothing more 
has been sent to Dana since 27 November,259 as I finished my own 
share of it (i.e. the non-military stuff) long ago. If circumstances in 
Manchester don't admit of your seriously applying yourself to the 
business this month, I shall have to give it up altogether and tell 
Dana on some PRETEXT or other that I can't go on with the 
Cyclopaedia. The fact that I send him long, new lists before 
polishing off the old ones cannot fail in the end to arouse his 
suspicions and compromise me. CONSEQUENTLY he's not even 
answering, let alone sending anything fresh. Nor can work of this 
kind be remunerative when there are constant hiatuses of a month 
or more. 
STILL, I try to avoid mentioning the matter to you because the 
last thing I want is to subject you to any strain that might damage 
your health. YET sometimes it seems to me that, if you could 
manage to do a little every two days or so, it might act as a CHECK 
on your junketings which, from what I know of Manchester and 
AT THE PRESENT EXCITED TIMES, seem to me 'unavoidable' and far from 
good for you. 
Nor can there be any question at present of my taking over the 
military  stuff,  which would entail spending a great deal of time at 
the Museum4 to no real effect, for it's absolutely essential that I 
should finish off my other work250—and it takes up all my 
time—even if the house should come tumbling about my ears! 
So, *my boy, try to come to a definitive resolution—one way or 
the other*.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 6 January 1858 
Dear Moor, 
You will have had the article3 in good time, at any rate, as I 
posted it before midnight on Monday, which means that it must 
have been delivered between 12 and 1 o'clock. 
I received Lassalle's letter and also wrote to tell you how amused 
Lupus and I were at the man who wrote Heraclitus.b Can my 
letter have gone astray?260 
During the worst of the crisis it was absolutely impossible for me 
to think of anything but the  GENERAL  CRASH.  I could neither read nor 
write and was, moreover, still irritable as a result of my illness. 
Then came the HOLIDAYS with fox-hunting and other such frivolities, 
but now that's all over and I am beginning to feel in need of a 
quieter occupation and way of life. Such being the case—with the 
added inducement of a good bout of catarrh—the letter C has 
come as a boon to me, and I shall embark on it this very evening. 
I don't imagine it will take me very long; at any rate I shall put my 
best foot forward and you will be able to send something off each 
week. Come to that, if 'Army' arrived in October and in time for 
Volume I261 then surely C, arriving in January, will be in time for 
Volume III. In view of the crisis the chaps won't be hurrying into 
print, otherwise Dana would have written long ago. If you hear 
from him, by the way, let me know. 
Incidentally the crisis, presently at a standstill, is about to take a 
new turn, at least so far as Manchester and the COTTON industry are 
concerned. On Monday a great many spinners went to Liverpool 
and bought 12,000 bales in order to restock to some extent, since 
many of them had nothing left. This pushed up the price of 
cotton, and at the same time the Greeks entered the market here 
and bought a fair amount, which brought about a corresponding 
rise locally. In Manchester and in Liverpool, the price has already 
risen by Ad (per lb) above the lowest point. Now the buyers are 
shying away again but, if the easterlies persist, cotton and yarn will

Herakleitos des Dunklen von Ephesos.

get even lower before the arrival of full shiploads round about 
February or March. What à thing to do, pushing up the price of 
yarn and cotton WITH FACTORIES ON SHORT TIME! It can only result in 
restricting demand more than ever and, if this has no immediate 
effect on prices, it is merely because production rises and falls with 
demand. The price of MIDDLING is again somewhere between 6 U 
and 6 3/8—today probably ô'Ad, although I haven't yet seen the 
closing prices. 
As regards produce, too, the difficulty of investing money seems 
to have enabled the chaps to effect once again a small, temporary 
rise which will last until the wind goes round to the west. 
The vast amount of surplus capital in the market is, by the way, 
truly astounding and proves yet again what colossal dimensions 
everything has assumed since 1847. It would not surprise me in 
the least if, even before the crisis has passed through its remaining 
phases, this superfluity of FLOATING CAPITAL were to bring about 
renewed speculation in shares. This superfluity of disposable 
capital has undoubtedly helped to keep speculation going in 
France, and to such good effect that now, having survived the 
panic, the Crédit mobilier 45 can claim to be one of the soundest 
institutions in the world. 
The letter about Lassalle must have reached you; have another 
look for it. I wrote it 2 or 3 days after receiving Lassalle's 
letter. 
Enclosed with my day-before-yesterday's article were a few lines 
from Lupus to your wife and the girls. Cordial regards to them 
from me. 
Your 
F. E. 
Today a line or two from Schramm saying that he had been 
rather worse but has now improved again. His worthy brothers 
now seem to be making the crisis a pretext for leaving him very 
much in the lurch. He talks of going either to Krefeld or to 
Virginia so as not to have to worry about where his next meal is 
coming from! I shall send him five pounds.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 7 January 1858 
Dear Moor, 
Herewith the beginning of C.262 I shall try and do a few more 
articles tomorrow evening. It seems to me that there are only 2 
articles for which material will be difficult to obtain—perhaps 
impossible in sufficient quantity—namely, CAPS (PERCUSSION)263 and 
'CAMP' (ROMAN, HEBREW, GREEK). The excerpts I made from Riistow 
about Caesar's camp" amount to very little for, though I had 
ordered my own copy of Riistow, the bookseller supplied an 
altogether different book. In the case of PERCUSSION CAPS, what I 
chiefly need is the story of the discovery of potassium tetrachlorate 
and its explosive qualities, likewise the dates when percussion 
fire-arms were introduced into the various armies. These two 
things would be useful to have. If you could manage to go to the 
British Museum and rout out something on this for me I could 
soon have these articles ready also, otherwise they'll hang fire since 
the libraries I use up here have no information on the subject. 
If, by the way, Monsieur Dana can't be bothered to reply when 
we send him our lists, he has only himself to blame. He could have 
sent a list for D long ago. Now I shall make one out  myself.  At all 
events the chap seems to be taking the whole business very lightly; 
I only hope he's sent you some money for it, otherwise it's high 
time to start kicking up a fuss. 
Charleyb is in Holland and will be going to Switzerland. Luckily 
the shortage of orders makes it possible for me to leave most of 
the tasks connected with the year's end to the office boys, so that 
I'm not unduly burdened with work. THAT'S ONE  GOOD  JOB. 
I enclose today's Guardian from which you will see that there is 
still a lot of  SHORT  TIME  here. Next week it may ease again somewhat. 
At present I am sending you only those Guardians in which there's 
something of commercial interest. 
I am reading, inter alia, Clausewitz's Vom Kriege. An odd way of 
philosophising, but per se very good. On the question as to 
whether one should speak of the art or the science of war, he says 
that, more than anything else, war resembles commerce. Combat is

DEAR  Frederic, 
I received your article1 " at 5  o'clock  on Tuesday afternoon.  It is 
HIGHLY AMUSING  and  will delight  the  Yankees.  The  news from India, 
by the by, is no  longer quite  so favourable  to the  worthy English. 
POOR  Havelock! 
I have definitely  not had  your letter about Lassalle.c  So it has 
either  got  held  up  somewhere  in Manchester  or has  been 
intercepted down here.260 
Lupus' letter  to the  family,  who  send  you  their regards, HAS 
PRODUCED  A GREAT SENSATION. 
Pieper  was  here during  the  Christmas holidays.  He arrived  in a 
state of alcoholic remorse  and was  more vapid  and  boring THAN 
EVER.  The  older  the  fellow grows  the  worse  he becomes.  He  seems 
to have acquired  the  pleasant habit  of drinking first thing  in the 
morning,  not tea or  coffee,  but a  PINT  [OFJ STOUT, which gives  him A 
SHEEPS EYE  for the  rest  of the day.  Indeed,  the  combination  of 
dilettantism  and  sententiousness, fadaise 6 and  pedantry makes  him 
ever harder  to stomach.  And, as  often  in the  case  of such laddies,

there lurks, beneath  an  apparently sunny temperament, much 
irritability, moodiness  and  crapulous despondency.  He has  pre­
sented  the  children with  two  daguerreotypes  of his  charming 
person which  are  truly sublime  and  might  be entitled 'Pieper with 
countenance exposed'. Both confected  on the  very morning  of his 
arrival  by  rail  in London.  The  first, still drunk with sleep,  A MOST 
ABJECT PICTURE OF MENTAL AND MORAL DEJECTION:  great, big mouth, flaccid 
jowl, blurred, sprawling features,  in his  eyes  A STUPENDOUS EXPRESSION 
OF NOTHINGNESS.  In the 2nd our  friend  had  already pulled himself 
together  and  remembered that  he was the  handsome  and  aimable 
Pieper.  It is the  awakening  of complacency  and its  victory over 
L ITER DEGRADATION.  The first  portrait— PIEPER  AS HE IS, the 2nd  AS  HE 
APPEARS  TO HIMSELF  and the  world  in general.  As  little Jenny aptly 
remarked,  all  that  was  wanting  to put the  fellow  in a  nutshell  was 
his drama,  WHAT  IS THE  MATTER? 
I enclose  an interesting document which  the  Urquhartites, with 
that  IMPERTURBABLE  importunity  of theirs, have extracted from  the 
BOARD  OF TRADE.264  In addition to the  BAD  STATE  of England's balance 
of trade during  the  past  3 years,  it will show  you  inter alia  how 
much money  was  being made  by Prussia  at the  time  of the  Russian 
war;  further, that our  HANSA TOWNS  are  AT THE  HEAD  of those regions 
whose balance  of trade favours England. 
The momentary  LULL  in the  crisis  is, or so it  seems  to me,  most 
advantageous  to our  interests—PARTY  INTERESTS,  I mean. Even  in 
1848,  after  the  first  LULL,  England suffered some very severe blows 
at 2 or 3  INTERVALS,  and at  that time  the  crater  had  already shifted 
from where  it had  been  in April  1847, etc. 
The 'Neapolitan Question',1  3 which  has  caused earnest politi­
cians such  a lot of  head-scratching,  has now  been resolved  by the 
EARTHQUAKE  IN A  MOST DELIGHTFUL MANNER.  At least that's what the 
POTHOUSE  POLITICIANS  OF THE  MORNING  ADVERTISER  say. 
You won't forget  to send  the  Guardian, will you? 
Above  all I beg you to  take care  of your health. Times will  get 
better  and  will make considerable  CLAIMS  on your  BODY.  SO temper  it 
and see  that  it comes  to no  harm. 
Salut.

Dear Marx, 
Herewith the article,b though it has just occurred to me that by a 
ludicrous slip I have written Wilson throughout instead of Inglis; 
perhaps you would alter this as there's no time to do so now. 
I shall do a few more C's for Tuesday, and finish 'Cavalry', 
which should make a good article and also be somewhat longer. 
Apropos, have you done 'Coehoorn' (Baron)? If not I have 
some excellent material. 
NB. I've no material whatever on 'Catapults'—there should be 
something in Ersch and Gruber.c

Your article3  is SPLENDID and IN STYLE and MANNER altogether 
reminiscent of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in its heyday. As for 
Windham, he may be a very bad general, but on this occasion the 
man was undone by what was the making of him at the 
Redan 267—unseasoned troops. I am generally of the opinion that 
in terms of bravery, self-reliance and STEADINESS this, the second 
army England has committed to India (and of which not a man 
will return), will not be able to hold a candle to the first, which 
seems to have dwindled away almost entirely. As regards the effect 
of the climate on the troops, while temporarily in charge of the 
military DEPARTMENT I showed in various articles by exact calcula­
tions that mortality was DISPROPORTIONATELY higher than stated in 
the official English despatches.268 In view of the DRAIN OF MEN  and 
BULLION which she will cost the English, India is now our best 
ally. 
On Monday I shall again visit the Museum,b after which I shall 
send you 'Catapult'—along with the other stuff you ask for— 
drawn from the best sources. I have not done 'Coehoorn', as it 
would have taken me too much time to unearth the correct 
sources. 
I am EXCEEDINGLY glad to learn that your health is progressing 
WELL. For the past 3 weeks I, too, have again been dosing myself 
and only stopped doing so today. I had been overdoing very much 
my nocturnal labours, accompanied, it is true, by mere lemonade 
on the one hand, but AN  IMMENSE  DEAL  OF TOBACCO  on the other. I am, 
by the way, discovering some nice arguments.250 E.g. I have 
completely demolished the theory of profit as hitherto pro­
pounded. What was of great use to me as regards method of 
treatment was Hegel's Logic at which I had taken another look  BY 
MERE ACCIDENT, Freiligrath having found and made me a present of 
several volumes of Hegel, originally the property of Bakunin. If 
ever the time comes when such work is again possible, I should 
very much like to write- 2 or 3 sheets making accessible to the 
common reader the rational aspect of the method which Hegel not 
only discovered but also mystified. 
Of all recent economists, Monsieur Bastiat with his Harmonies 
économiques represents the very dregs of fatuity at their most 
concentrated. Only a crapaud 61 could have concocted an harmoni­
ous pot-au-feu" 1 of this kind.

1848 lies heavy  on his  stomach.  So great  is his  faith  in himself that 
he may think himself capable of exploiting the  MIDDLE CLASS  or 
imagine that  if only,  ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,  Ernest Jones could  be got 
into Parliament, world history could  not  fail to take  A NEW TURN.  The 
best of it all is  that—out  of SPITE  against Jones,  OF COURSE—Reynolds 
is now  posing  in his  paper a as the  most rabid opponent  of the 
MIDDLE CLASS  and of all compromise. Mr B. O'Brien has likewise 
become an  IRREPRESSIBLE CHARTIST  AT ANY PRICE.  Jones' only excuse is the 
enervation  now  rampant among  the  working class  in England. 
However that  may be, if he  goes  on as at  present  he  will become 
either  DUPE  of the  MIDDLE CLASS  or RENEGADE.  The  FACT  that he should 
now seek  to avoid  me as  anxiously  as he  once used  to consult  me 
over  the  merest trifle  is  evidence  of  anything  but a  good 
conscience. 
Herewith  a letter  for  Lupus from Laura  and  Jenny.  The two 
GIRLS  naturally imagine that  you  might take umbrage  at Lupus 
appearing  to be  preferred  as a  correspondent. Hence they have 
earnestly admonished me not to forget to tell you  THAT YOURS SHALL 
BE THE  NEXT TURN. 
I shall wait another  3 weeks until  the  situation  has  pretty well 
come  to a  head  and  then write  to Mr  Dana saying that  I cannot 
go on  working  for the  Tribune  if I'm  restricted  to 4  articles  a 
month,  and  that  6 is the  minimum.  In  fact  I am now  invariably 
obliged  to compress into  1 article sufficient material  for 2, and 
hence am doing double the work for  HALF  THE  PRICE. THIS WILL 
NEVER  DO.

MARX  TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  23 January  1858 
Dear Engels, 
I have received:  1. Copies  of the  Guardian;  2. C  ('Carabine', 
etc. 269). You  have  not  told  me  whether  you got my  letter, together 
with an  enclosure  for  Lupus, sent  off a  week  ago  today.3 
Herewith  a letter from Dana which  you  must return  as it has 
not yet  been answered.  One  disagreeable consequence  so far as I 
am concerned  is that  I am  already considerably  in the  fellows' 
debt, having miscalculated what  was due to me and  drawn  a 
further amount after sending  off  'Cannon'.235  The  PAY,  by the by, 
isn't even  A PENNY THE LINE. 
As regards  the new B  articles Dana  is asking for—and  for me 
the main thing  is to pay off as  quickly  as possible what  1 have 
overdrawn  on  Appleton, otherwise  I shall  be  unable  to  draw 
anything  on the  Tribune  and  hence  be  stone broke—they  are, 
with one  exception, taken from  the  list you  drew  up. As  regards 
that one  exception—'THE  HISTORY OF THE BENGAL REBELLION'—I  suggest 
the most appropriate course would  be  tell Dana straight  out it 
can't  be  done.  How get  hold  of the  sources  at such short notice? 
Since it  'SHALL  BE SF.XT  AT ONCE'  and must be  'AS  BRIEF  AS POSSIBLE',  the 
work involved would  be out of all  proportion  to the  PAY  and it 
would simply prevent  us  from getting  on  with  the  other articles. 
What  is your opinion?  The  military side  is the  more important, 
but it seems  to me  that  the  whole, whether military  or political,  has 
not yet  reached  the  stage where  it could  be  'sent  AT  ONCE'. 
I cannot recall  the  MISTAKE IN IIHEI BAITI.E OF-ALBLERA'  to which Dana 
refers. 270 
Freiligrath writes  to say  that the  great Ernst Dronke  has  arrived  in 
London from Paris, having left  the  latter place  for the  first time  on 
account  of the  attempted assassination.271

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 25 January 1858 
Dear Marx, 
The letters have all arrived safely. It will be utterly impossible to 
do the BENGAL REBELLION in the time stipulated and I would advise 
you, while you are about it, to point out to Mr Dana that, had he 
been more prompt in agreeing to our proposals and the list we 
sent him, he would have had all these articles long ago. He can 
perfectly well fit in BENGAL REBELLION as HINDUSTAN REBELLION or 
something of the sort.272 As to the alleged howler,270  I can't look 
into it this moment, there being no time, but shall do so 
tomorrow. The item was taken from Brockhaus' so it will probably 
be correct. 
Lassalle's letter is still up here. 
I have the material ready for 'Blenheim', 'Borodino' and many 
more and you will be receiving a  LOT  on Friday, provided the 
Indian  MAIL  doesn't necessitate my doing an article, which seems 
unlikely judging by the telegraphic despatch. I shall have to look 
up 'Bidassoa', etc. But what is all this about Dana saying he 
had already asked for these articles? It's the first I've heard 
of it. 
Harney will have written to tell you that poor Schramm died a 
week ago on Friday. I have no details yet. I wrote and asked

Harney,273 should  he  find anything  in your handwriting  or mine, 
to take  it away  and  hold  it at our  disposal—it would  be too bad if 
anything  of  that kind were allowed  to  fall into  the  hands  of 
Mr Rudolf, 3 who has  become  an  out-and-out Prussian.  I had not 
thought Schramm would have  any  serious attacks before  the 
spring.  The  poor fellow  was  putting  up a  splendid fight against 
the disease while  I was  there  and,  from what  I hear, continued  to 
do so  until  the end. Our old  guard  is rapidly dwindling away 
during this long spell  of peace! 
Business here  is very shaky. Every fortnight  an  attempt  is made 
to push  up  cotton prices,  the  moment chosen being when  a few 
spinners have  to buy. It  succeeds  for  three  or four days  and  then 
prices fall again. Generally speaking  we are now 5/sd  above  the 
lowest point.  It's  much  the  same with ourselves.  As  soon  as prices 
become thoroughly depressed  as a  result  of a  fortnight's stagna­
tion,  the  Indian  and  Levantine buyers step into  the  market  and 
force everything  up;  after that  no one  wants  to buy and  prices 
gradually fall again. Everything  is still  far  from normal.  The 
spinners  are  going  on to  full time,  not  because there  is any  real 
demand,  but  because others  are  doing  so and  because they're 
heartily sick  of SHORT TIME.  On the  whole  the  spinners' position  has 
deteriorated because  the  difference  in  price between  raw  cotton 
and yarn  has  diminished.  The  Germans  are  still buying very little. 
Prospects here  are far  from brilliant; every  day  trade suffers  a 
CHECK  because  of attempts  to force  up  prices  and, if  that doesn't 
happen, they say that  THERE  IS AN  IMPROVED FEELING  IN THE  MARKET. 
IMPROVED  BE DAMNED! 
The enclosure  for  Lupus  was a  source  of great pride  and joy to 
the old  man.b  He  sends  his  warmest regards  to the  writers.  By the 
way I hardly  saw him at all  last week;  we  kept missing  one  another 
and later  he had a  slight touch  of tic  douloureux? 
Warm regards to the  FAMILY.

Windham3 as well today, but in the first place the PARTICULARS are 
still very confused and it is absolutely essential to wait for the 
official report on the affair, for hitherto everything has been 
glossed over; and, secondly, I had no time this afternoon, was 
barely able to look over the 3 articles. Also, I have too bad a cold 
to risk going into town at midnight to post the letter. Tell Dana 
that the material is still incomplete. 
Have you sent Dana my C list? If not, do so now so that he can 
reply in good time. Once again his C is LUDICROUSLY INCOMPLETE. 
Unfortunately I couldn't make 'Borodino' any shorter since all 
previous accounts of the battle have been quite wrong.

DEAR  Frederick, 
The freezing weather which has set in here and the real shortage

11 F. Engels, 'Windham's Defeat'.

myself  to do  so only after HEAVY PRESSURE  FROM  WITHOUT. My wife has 
pointed out to me that you had miscalculated through having sent 
a remittance from Jersey earlier than usual, and hence would not 
send anything this month unless  I wrote expressly; that she had 
pawned her SHAWL, etc., etc., and was  at a  loss where  to turn.  In 
short,  I must write, which  is why I am doing so. Indeed,  if these 
conditions persist,  I'd  sooner be miles under the ground than  go 
on scraping along  in this way. Always  to be a  burden  on  others 
while constantly tormented oneself  by  beastly trifles becomes 
unbearable  in the long run.  I personally can bury myself  in my 
work  and  escape  the  misère  by devoting  my  attention  to 
universalities. My wife, OF COURSE, has  no  such refuge, etc., etc. 
Lassalle's book arrived today";  it cost 2/ not the book, but the 
carriage. This circumstance ensured  it a  bad reception.  2 volumes 
of 30 sheets EACH. Have no more than squinted at it. In his preface 
the fellow deludes readers into believing that  he has  been 
gestating  it since 1846. Seems altogether  Old  Hegelian. Very 
possibly the legal tradition  of hermeneutics came  in useful for the 
interpretation and comparison  of passages. Nous verrons? though 
the thing's too bulky  to be  read from cover  to cover. 
I have also heard from  Mr  Pieper. He imparts the interesting 
secret that, while here,  he was  suffering from 'abdominal 
difficulties' and hence 'may' have seemed  a bore. 
The Orsini, etc., conspiracy271 might well  put  paid  to the 
Prussian amnesty.275  The day  before yesterday  the  police here 
forced their way into Orsini's rooms at midnight, and INVEIGLED his 
maidc into accompanying them  to Scotland Yard, where she was 
interrogated  by  Mr Richard Mayne and some French mouchards? 
This escapade, besides compromising  Mr  Pam, failed  in its 
purpose even more lamentably  in that Martin Bernard has taken 
possession  of all  letters addressed  to Orsini  in London since the 
latter's arrest, Orsini himself having burned  all the  rest before 
leaving here.

DEAR  Frederick, 
The 3 B  articles received.3  It's  excellent that  you  should have 
made 'Borodino' longer. Since  the  fellows' columns  are so  IMMENSE 
and their  PAY  so bad, the  only remedy  is to  lengthen  the  articles.  I 
hope that when  you  come  to do  'Cavalry'  you  will spin  it out as 
much  as possible  so that  I can get rid of my  DEBTS  to those curs. 
In France things  are  splendid.  The  COOLNESS  with which  the 
épiciers b responded  to the  news  of the  attempted assassination 271 
has exasperated  the  fellow.c  The  secret  of this indifference  of the 
épiciers  is doubtless  the  unspoken desire  of many  of them that 
some sudden political event should  get  them  out of  their mess. 
The majority  of the  laddies  had had  their bills renewed  by the 
Bank, Discount Association,  etc.,  which were acting  on the  ORDERS 
of Boustrapa. 40 However,  to put off is not to  write  off. A  large 
number  of French bourgeois, with commercial ruin staring them 
in the  face,  are  anxiously awaiting  the day of  reckoning. They  now 
find themselves  in much  the  same  STATE  as Boustrapa before  the 
coup d'état. 276 ANY  POLITICAL PRETEXT  FOR  MAKING  AN  HONOURABLE EXIT WILL, 
CONSEQUENTLY,  BE EAGERLY SEIZED UPON BY THE DAMNED FELLOWS JUSt  aS it  WaS 
10 years  ago.  Boustrapa knows this  and now  wishes  to act the 
real 'despot'. Nous verrons?  If he  pins  his  faith  on  Magnan, 
Castellane,  etc., he  will  be left high  and  dry. 277 
In my  economic work250  I have  now  reached  a point  at which  I 
could  do  with some information  on  practical matters from  you, 
since nothing  of the  kind  is to be  found  in theoretical writings.  I 
mean,  the  circulation  of  capital—how  it varies  in various kinds  of 
business;  the  effect  of the  same  on  profit  and  prices.  If you can 
provide  me  with  any  information  on the  subject,  it would  be  VERY 
welcome. 
Mr Lassalle,  in his preface  to 
Die Philosophie Herakleitos  des  Dunklen  von  Ephesos, says inter alia  : 
'All but a  small part  of the  same'  (the  book)  'was  completed early  in 1846,  and I 
was on the  point  of putting  the  concluding touches  to it  when suddenly  an interest 
of a different kind—how true  in every respect  is Sophocles'  dictum:

Dear Marx, 
Your two letters arrived together this morning. I enclose a fiver; 
unfortunately I'm very tight for money myself and Schramm 
touched me for five pounds at the beginning of January—in the 
circumstances there was absolutely no question of refusing, but in 
consequence I was even more broke. 'Windham'b will be ready for 
Tuesday. 
Apropos, would you send me another copy of the B articles 
Dana asked for (both the original ones and those subsequently 
ordered) as I have mislaid mine. 
How goes it with 'Camp', 'Catapults' and 'Caps' (Percussion)?263 
Well, the would-be assassins271 may not have bagged Bonaparte, 
but they caught K. Heinzen all right.  . You will recall his 
bloodthirsty threats of destruction in 1848 and his big talk about

more of fulminating silver. I said at once, judging by the appalling 
number of injured and relatively few dead, that the bombs had 
been overfilled and had therefore burst into a mass of small 
splinters, none of which had much force. The asses went about it 
with more stupidity than cunning. With a filling of ordinary 
powder the bombs would inevitably have had a much greater 
effect. Instead they cram in as much fulminating mercury as the 
things will hold, thereby producing a hail of small, relatively 
innocuous splinters. Dr Larrey confirms my view. So  MUCH  FOR

Heraclitus, the Dark Philosopher by Lassalle the Luminous One is, 
au fond, e a very silly concoction. Every time Heraclitus uses an 
image to demonstrate the unity of  AFFIRMATION  and  NEGATION—and 
this is  often—IN  STEPS  Lassalle and makes the most of the occasion 
by treating us to some passage from Hegel's Logic which is  HARDLY 
improved in the process; always at great length too, like a 
schoolboy who must show in his essay that he has thoroughly 
understood his 'essence' and 'appearance' as well as the 'dialectical 
process'. Once he has got this into his speculative noddle, one may 
be sure that the schoolboy will nevertheless be able to carry out 
the process of ratiocination only in strict accord with the 
prescribed formula and the formes sacramentales. 1 Just so our 
Lassalle. The fellow seems to have tried to puzzle out Hegelian 
logic via Heraclitus, nor ever to have tired of beginning the 
process all over again. As for learning, there is a tremendous

display of it. But, as any well-informed person will know, provided 
one has the time and the money and, like Mr Lassalle, can have 
Bonn University Library delivered ad libitum to one's home, it is 
easy enough to assemble such an array of quotations. One can see 
what an amazing swell the fellow himself thinks he is in this 
philological finery, and how he moves with all the grace of a man 
wearing FASHIONABLE DRESS for the first time in his life. Since most 
philologists are not possessed of the speculative thinking 
dominant in Heraclitus, every Hegelian has the incontestable 
advantage of understanding what the philologist does not. (It 
would, by the by, be strange indeed if, by learning Greek, a fellow 
were to become a philosopher in Greek without being one in 
German.) Instead of simply taking this for granted, Mr Lassalle 
proceeds to lecture us in a quasi-Lessingian manner. In long-
winded, lawyer's style he vindicates the Hegelian interpretation as 
opposed to the erroneous exegeses of the philologists—erroneous 
for want of specialised knowledge. Thus we are accorded the 
twofold gratification, first, of having dialectical matters which we 
had all but forgotten expounded to us at considerable length and, 
secondly, of seeing this 'speculative heritage' vindicated (qua 
special province of Mr Lassalle's philological-jurisprudential astute­
ness and erudition) vis-à-vis the unspeculative philologists. Despite 
the fellow's claim, by the way, that hitherto Heraclitus has been a 
book with 7 seals, he has to all intents and purposes added nothing 
whatever that is new to what Hegel says in the History of  Philosophy." 
All he does is to enlarge on points of detail which could, of course, 
have been accomplished quite adequately in two sheets of print. 
Still less does it occur to the laddie to come out with any critical 
reflections -on dialectics as such. If all the fragments by Heraclitus 
were put together in print, they would HARDLY fill half a sheet. Only 
a chap who brings out his books at the expense of the frightful 
'specimen of humankind' b can presume to launch upon the world 
2 volumes of 60 sheets on such a pretext. 
Heraclitus, the Dark Philosopher, is quoted as saying in an attempt 
to elucidate the transformation of all things into their opposite: 
'Thus gold changeth into all things, and all things change into 
gold.' Here, Lassalle says, gold means money (c'est juste c) and 
money is value. d Thus the Ideal, Universality, the One (value), and 
things, the Real, Particularity, the Many. He makes use of this 
surprising insight to give, in a lengthy note, AN EARNEST OF HIS 
a G. W. F. Hegel, Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie. - b Sophie von 
Hatzfeldt (see this volume, p. 257) - c that is correct - d  F. Lassalle, Die Philosophie

DISCOVERIES IN THE SCIENCE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY. Every other word a 
howler, but set forth with remarkable pretentiousness. It is plain 
to me from this one note that, in his second grand opus, the 
fellow intends to expound political economy in the manner of 
Hegel.278 He will discover to his cost that it is one thing for a 
critique to take a science to the point at which it admits of a 
dialectical presentation, and quite another to apply an abstract, 
ready-made system of logic to vague presentiments of just such a 
system. 
But, as I remarked immediately after receipt of his first 
self-complacent letter, the Old Hegelians and philologists must 
indeed have been PLEASED to discover such old-fashioned virtues in 
a young man who passes for a great revolutionary.3 On top of 
that, he bows and scrapes to all and sundry in the hope of 
assuring himself a favourable reception. As soon as I've skimmed 
through the  stuff,  I'll send it too.

Dear Moor, 
At times last week I wasn't well. There would seem to be some 
slight vestige of my former complaint which, though too mild to 
take a serious hold, plagues me with all kinds of little miseries—a 
peculiarly sensitive skin, cuts slow to heal, abscesses on the fingers, 
and similar boring and idiotic things. Fortunately there is no 
longer any sign at all of septic glands, so I have nothing to fear on

that score. These litde miseries crop up whenever I have a cold, 
and will doubtless continue to bother me off and on until I go to 
bathe in the sea again. Pending that I shall, at any rate, have to be 
careful. My piles, by the way, which have become something of a 
problem since I got back, act as a diversion; this may help at the 
time,  but makes sitting impossible for the next day or two, except 
on horseback. Hence my silence last week and the dearth of 
contributions since Monday. Most evenings I could only lie down. 
However my cold is now  SUBSIDING—so  much so that yesterday I 
was again able to ride 28 miles, which means we shall be able to 
pitch in again tomorrow. 
Au fond 3 Mr Lassalle doesn't seem to have taken much trouble 
over the dark Heraclitus. Lupus was much amused by your 
description of his method; it gave him some satisfaction to learn 
that Greek scholarship is not this gentleman's forte. When the 
book b arrives I shall let him study it. 
Today friend Belfield again presented himself for election to 
the city council and suffered a resounding defeat. 196 votes 
against 143 in his favour.

in all, it did me a power of good though it kept me from my work, 
and I haven't got far enough with the stuff I've begun—'Burmah', 
etc., etc.—to have a hope of getting it ready in time for tonight. 
It's sickening to read long works on 'Burmah', yet be unable to

I too have been sent Harney DEARS rubbish.b  For this Harro 
Harring, who lives in Jersey (though I never saw him), must take 
the chief blame. The description of Krefeld is killing. Real vintage 
Harney. He has turned Schramm's death into yet another great 
melodramatic spectacle, the principal role being played by 
G. J. H. c of course. The whole affair, funeral and all, his letters 
headed HASTE! IMMEDIATE!, etc., and then the presumption of asking 
me to come to Jersey to figure among the crapauds 91 and 
Waschlapskis d—I find the whole affair repugnant. He's a rotten 
little blighter and Jersey is just the right place for him; moreover he 
is absolutely delighted at having involved his paper in a libel action 
brought by François Godfrey, Jersey's feudal lord. 237 
The 'Engels  ESQ' certainly does look very odd. I ought never to 
forgive Harney, if only because the best he has to say of me boils 
down to Esq. Grosse bête! e 
Jones,  too, is evidently up to some pretty tricks. The obese 
Livesay, whom he appointed CHAIRMAN of his conference,245 is a 
wretched little bourgeois who swears by Miall and who, in

At very best  I shan't  be  able  to  draw anything more  on the 
Tribune against  the  articles  I have sent  in until  the  matter with 
Appleton  is SETTLED. 3 My  estimate  of the  value  of the  last goods 
despatched  to him was  badly  out.  Moreover,  a longish article  on 
'Bolivar* elicited objections from Dana because,  he  said,  it is 
written IN A  PARTISAN STYLE  and he asked me to cite my  AUTHORITIES. 
This  I can, of  course,  do,  although  it's a  singular demand.  As 
regards  the  PARTISAN STYLE,  it is  true that  I departed somewhat from 
the tone  of a  cyclopaedia.  To see the  most dastardly, most 
miserable  and  meanest  of blackguards described  as Napoleon  I was 
altogether  too  much. Bolivar  is a  veritable Soulouque.282 
I CONGRATULATE  you  UPON YOUR EQUESTRIAN PERFORMANCES.  Only don't take 
too many breakneck jumps,  as there will soon  be more important 
occasion for risking your neck. You seem  TO  RIDE SOMEWHAT HARD THIS 
HOBBYHORSE.  In any case I don't believe that the  CAVALRY  is the 
speciality  in which  you  will be of the  greatest service  to Germany.  I 
would venture another little objection,  viz.  whether  OVEREXERTION  IN 
ANY LINE  is compatible with your health. Aurea mediocritasc  in all 
types  of exertion,  or so at  least  a doctor assures  me,  should remain 
the norm  for you for  some time  yet. 
The Bonaparte affair271  had  indeed  put a  sorry  end to the 
proposed Prussian amnesty.275 Louis,  by the way, is  merely aping 
his putative uncle.283  He is, in  fact,  not  only Napoleon  le Petit (in 
Victor Hugo's sense d as  opposed  to  Napoléon  le  Grand)  but he 
PERSONATES  IN A  MOST ADMIRABLE WAY THE LITTLENESS  of the  great Napoleon. 
I have looked  up  Cobbett  for  1802-03 where  I discover that  the 
'DEN  OF ASSASSINS'  AND ALL  THAT LITERALLY  appeared in the Moniteur of 
that time. 284 Inter alia,  the  Moniteur  of 9  August  1802  declares 
word  for  word: 
•'Either  the  English government authorises  and  tolerates these public  and 
private crimes,  in which case  it cannot  be said that such conduct  is consistent with 
British generosity, civilisation,  and  honour;  or it  cannot prevent them,  in which 
case it does  not  deserve  the  name  of government; above  all, if it  does  not  possess 
the means  of repressing assassination  and  calumny  and  protecting social  order.'  *e

Dear Moor, 
Every day this week I have meant to write to you, and every day 
the steady rise in prices has stopped me from doing so. You will 
remember my telling you3 that 6d for Middling Orleans was the 
highest price compatible with FULL TIME. NOW, with Middling 
Orleans at  53/4d,  7/8 of all spinners have gone on to  FULL  TIME,  and 
the result of this asininity is that, out of sheer impatience, they've 
pushed Middling Orleans up to  7$Uà in 6 weeks! Yarn and cloth 
haven't followed in the same proportion, of course; the manufac­
turer's MARGIN between the price of his raw material and the 
finished product has been reduced to below cost price and now 
the asses want to revert to SHORT TIME, which they ought never to 
have abandoned! 
The Guardians will go off today at the same time. 
I trust that your bill has been honoured. Since you had in any 
case advised them so long in advance, they should certainly have 
told you long ago had there been any intention of returning it. 
Enclosed another little thing for Dana.285  If the fellow wants to 
lay down the law on the strength of his paltry 2 dollars, then he 
deserves some rough words. At all events he can't expect more 
than we are already providing—largely original work instead of

since I have,exceptionally little spare time just now. As regards the 
Stoics, I did not myself study their relationship to Heraclitus in the 
matter of natural philosophy, because of the novice-like earnest­
ness of their approach to this discipline. Of Epicurus, on the other 
hand, it can be shown en detail that, although he bases himself on 
the natural philosophy of Democritus, he is for ever turning the 
argument inside out. Cicero and Plutarch can hardly be blamed 
for not having grasped this since it has eluded even men of 
intellect such as Bayle, not to speak of Hegel ipsissimus.3 Nor, for 
that matter, could one expect Hegel, the first to comprehend 
the entire history of philosophy, not to commit errors of 
detail. 
From the papers you will have seen that Palmerston has fallen.

suspect that his last BLUNDERS were deliberate, so that he could make 
his exit pro tempore. They affirm that le dernier but de toute sa vie b

believes he has managed to do so, that at first other hands are to 
be concerned with the execution of his plan and that, when the 
imbroglio has become sufficiently involved and .is far enough 
advanced, THE NATION WILL BE FORCED TO CALL AGAIN UPON HIM. This latter 
opinion may be too recherché, but that Pam did not resign in any 
way against his will seems to me unquestionable. 
Now, as to your cousin,0  there's one thing I am willing to do, but 
the Presse, I assume, would not. 254 All I could commit myself to 
would be one article a week on trade, finance, etc., in any one of 
the three countries, England, France and the United States of 
America, depending on which is INTERESTING This is also the most 
practicable form in which to attack Bonaparte. It is also a form 
which would permit me to have absolutely nothing to do with the 
Presse politically. It seems to me that just now there is widespread 
ignorance, especially about French financial affairs and French 
economic conditions in general. The question is whether the 
subject will be of sufficient interest to the  Presse,  or RATHER, to its 
readers. They, of course, must be the best judges of that. For a 
weekly article of this kind I would ask £1 STERLING. Moreover, it 
would be necessary for me to have a few copies of the Presse 
beforehand so that I could see whether  MY  PRINCIPLES would at all 
permit me to work for the paper. HOWEVER THAT MAY BE, will you 
thank your cousin on my behalf for having remembered me in 
this connection.

Now let me tell you how my political economy2 is getting on. I 
have IN  FACT  been at work on the final stages for some months. But 
the thing is proceeding very slowly because no sooner does one set 
about finally disposing of subjects to which one has devoted years 
of study than they start revealing new aspects and demand to be 
thought out further. On top of which I am not master of my time 
but RATHER its slave. Only the nights are left for my own work, 
which in turn is often disrupted by bilious attacks or recurrences 
of liver trouble. All things considered it would be most convenient 
for me to bring out the whole work in instalments without any 
rigid datelines. This might also have the advantage of making it 
easier to find a publisher, since less working capital would be tied 
up in the venture. You would, OF COURSE, oblige me by trying to 
find someone in Berlin prepared to undertake this. By 'instal­
ments', I mean fascicles similar to those in which Vischer's 
Aesthetik came out. 
The work I am presently concerned with is a Critique of 
Economic Categories or,  IF YOU  LIKE,  a critical exposé of the system of 
the bourgeois economy. It is at once an exposé and, by the same 
token, a critique of the system. I have very little idea how many 
sheets the whole thing will amount to. Had I the means, the time 
and the leisure to finish the whole thing off completely prior to 
placing it before the public, I would condense it a great deal, a 
method for which I have always had a predilection. But printed 
thus,  in successive instalments—easier for readers to understand 
perhaps but certainly detrimental to the form—it is bound to be 
rather more diffuse. Nota bene: As soon as you know definitely 
whether or not the thing can be done in Berlin, kindly write to me, 
since if it's no go there I'll try Hamburg. A further point is that I 
must be paid by the publisher who takes the thing on—a 
stipulation over which it might come to grief in Berlin. 
The presentation—the manner of it, I mean—is entirely 
scientific, hence unobjectionable to the police in the ordinary 
sense. The whole is divided into 6 books: 1. On Capital (contains a 
few introductory CHAPTERS). 2. On Landed Property. 3. On Wage 
Labour. 4. On the State. 5. International Trade. 6. World Market. 
I cannot, of course, avoid all critical consideration of other 
economists, in particular a polemic against Ricardo in as much as 
even he, qua bourgeois, cannot but commit blunders even from a 
strictly economic viewpoint. But generally speaking the critique and 
history of political economy and socialism would form the subject 
of another work, and, finally, the short historical outline of the 
development of economic categories and relations yet a third. Now

that I am at  last ready  to set to  work after  15  years  of study,  I 
have  an  uncomfortable feeling that turbulent movements from 
without will probably  INTERFERE AFTER  ALL.  NEVER MIND.  If I finish too 
late and  thus find  the  world  no  longer attentive  to such subjects, 
the fault  is clearly  MY OWN. 
I was  greatly amused  by  your remarks about Rudolf Schramm.3 
Sad to say,  a worthier Schramm, Conrad, brother  of the  above  and 
one of my  best friends, died  of  consumption  in  Jersey some 
4 weeks  ago. The  death within  the  past  few  years  of Weerth, 
Schramm  and Dr Daniels  has  been  a blow  to  their friends, 
amongst whom  I was  happy enough  to count  myself. 
There  are  turbulent times  in the  offing.  If I  were merely  to 
consult  my own  private inclinations,  I would wish  for  another  few 
years  of superficial calm. There could,  at any  rate,  be no  better 
time  for  scholarly undertakings and, after  all,  what  has  happened 
over  the  last  ten  years must have increased  any  RATIONAL BEINCS 
contempt  for the  masses  as for  individuals  to such  a degree that 
'odi profanum vulgus  et arceo' b has  almost become  an  inescapable 
maxim. However  all  these  are  themselves philistine ruminations

MARX  TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  22 February  1858 
Dear Engels, 
Herewith  a letter from Lassalle,  INTERESTING  on account  of the bit 
about Rudolf Schramm. What  the  chap says about  my  'logic' 
amounts  to nothing more than  a refusal  to  understand  me. All I 
did was  simplement inform  him  that  I hadn't written  to him 
because  MATTERS HAD COME  TO A POINT  at which a verbal explanation was 
necessary if written  INTERCOURSE  were to continue. IN  FACT  I had  DONE 
this ticklish  PASSAGE  IN A VERY DIPLOMATICAL STYLE. 3 
In my  reply  I asked  him, of  course,  to  look round  for a 
publisher  in Berlin.  It is my  intention  to bring  the  thing  out by 
instalments? having neither  the  time  nor the  means  to complete  the 
whole  of it at  leisure. This initial form  may be  detrimental  to the 
form. Better  for  distribution,  at any  rate. Also makes  it easier  to 
find a publisher. 
As for the  lousy Yankees nothing,  of course, could have given 
me greater pleasure than  to  write  and  tell Messrs Dana  and 
Appleton to—. But the  STATE  OF AFFAIRS  IS SIMPLY  THIS: 
I had  overdrawn  £20 on  Appleton. According  to my  reckoning, 
the amount overdrawn  was at  most  £5.  However  I had no 
alternative, since some accounts which were  due at the end of 
December  had to be  paid.  WELL.  For the  time being  Mr  Dana  has 
now credited  the à compte c of the  Tribune with £20—a  sum  which 
I was to draw on the Tribune  EXACTLY TOMORROW—in  this way 
virtually cutting  off all my  resources until  the  manuscript sent  to 
Appleton  has paid  off the  damned thing.  So  until then  I am  IN A 
DEADLOCK.  AS  soon  as this chap Appleton  has been paid  in kind, 
thus enabling  me to dip  into  the  Tribunes treasure-chest again,  I 
am all for  dropping  him  altogether—more especially  if the  Vienna 
Presse accedes  to my  suggestion  of a  weekly article  on  finance. 254 
At all events I am of the opinion  THAT  EVEN  THE  MENACE  TO STOP  SUPPLY 
WOULD BRING ROUND DANA  AND  APPLETON,  AND  INDUCE THEM  TO  OFFER  A BETTER 
PAYMENT.  But  this move  can  only  be made when  the  present  DEADLOCK 
has been resolved.  By my  reckoning some  30 or 32  columns will

still remain  to be  sent  if the  swine have taken 'Bolivar'. Until then 
I shall  be quite literally  in the  air.  Moreover,  the  rascals know that 
they now  have  me in  their power. Hence, none  of the  stuff that 
now remains  to be  done should  be  condensed more than  is 
absolutely necessary  to avoid making  it insipid. 
As far as  'Bülow'  and  'Beresford'  are  concerned,  I can  write  the 
biographies,  but the  military part should  be  written entirely  by you,  in 
English,  in  order that these articles should  not  stand  out  from  the 
rest. Besides, mere indications  are of no use to me in  this case 
since following them  up  would, after  all,  involve research—an 
impossibility just  now. As  soon  as you  have finished with  B, 
you must  get to  work  on  'Cavalry', since this will  pay off the 
debt. 
SUCH,  MY BOY,  IS THE  SITUATION.  Fortunately events  in the  outside 
world offer  a good deal  of solace just  now.  Otherwise,  in private  I 
THINK  I lead  THE  MOST TROUBLED LIFE THAT  CAN  BE  IMAGINED. NEVER MIND! 
What could  be  more asinine  for  people  of wide aspirations than  to 
get married  at all,  thus letting themselves  in for the  petites misères 
de la vie  domestique  et  privée. 3 
What will  the  good Guardian  say  now?  The  REVENGE  of Milner 
Gibson  and  Bright  is INDEED  classic.287 Between ourselves,  I think 
that Pam  HAD  his  'raysons'b  for  dissolving  his  own  ministry  and  that 
all the  apparent  BLUNDERS  which  led to  this  RESULT  were calculated 
ones  so far as he was  concerned. 
From  a  PAPER  which recently appeared  in the  Moniteur  it 
transpires that,  IF  COMPARED WITH  1855 and '56, the  STORED  UP 
COMMODITIES IN THE FRENCH CUSTOMS  entrepots' 1 are  enormous, while  the 
Economists correspondent declares outright that Bonaparte caused 
the Bank  TO  MAKE  ADVANCES  on the  same  and  thus  ENABLED THEIR  HOLDERS 
TO RETURN THEM.  But  with  the  approach  of spring they will inevitably 
BE THROWN  ON THE  MARKET, AND THEN, THERE  IS NO DOUBT. THERE WILL  BE A  CRASH 
IN FRANCE, ANSWERED  BY  CRASHES  IN  BELGIUM, HOLLAND, RHENISH PRUSSIA 
ETC e 
In Italy  the  economic situation  is truly frightful. Side  by  side 
with  INDUSTRIAL  CRISIS,  AGRICULTURAL DISTRESS.  (This last, according  to the 
CONCLUSIONS  of an  AGRICULTURAL CONGRESS  IN FRANCE,  very bad there too.

IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 24 February 1858 
Dear Moor, 
Enclosed a fiverb—unfortunately I couldn't shell out yesterday, 
otherwise you would have had it 24 hours earlier—and the article 
'Brescia'. Now there are only 'Burmah' (half-finished—it's long job 
searching out the reports on the latest war289 ) and 'Bomarsund' to 
be done for B, and after that the two biographies. As to these I 
can soon get together what is needed on 'Beresford', but I'm in a 
quandary with 'Bülow' because I find it absolutely impossible to 
get hold of a good book on the wars of liberation. 0 His resolution 
at Grossbeeren (he beat the French against Bernadotte's wishes) is 
to be commended and the victory at Dennewitz was a most 
remarkable one: 40,000 Prussians beat 70,000 Frenchmen. 197 
However I shall have another look round. Once the stuff for B is 
finished I shall go on to 'Cavalry'. 
I don't agree with the idea of dropping Appleton —unless that 
is, we have to go to the Continent. I find the encyclopaedic course 
most useful and, after all, the thing is going so slowly that it could 
be done entirely at one's leisure were financial circumstances not

so pressing* Anyway you should threaten to resign as soon as the 
situation permits. I too believe that it would prove instantly 
beneficial. 
In these circumstances the great Lassalle might be very useful. I 
trust he does what is necessary as regards the political economy, 
and likewise the Vienna  Presse.  He must have been very dilatory in 
the latter case, seeing that you had already written to him before 
about the financial article. I am keeping his letter here to show 
Lupus, since you've answered it anyway. 
The historical irony whereby Mr Pam received his notice at the 
hands of Gibson and Bright is very pretty.287 What the Guardian 
has to say about it you will be able to see from the 3 copies I am 
sending off at the same time as this letter. Pam, by the way, 
evidendy intends to eliminate any possibility of his return—the 
prosecution of the wretched little publisher3 in London, the witch 
hunt that ended in the cellar in Birmingham (see day before 
yesterday's Sun,  A CAPITAL HOAX) and other gestures of subservience 
to Bonaparte that crop up every day cannot fail in the long run to 
infuriate John Bull. 
In Italy the oudook can't be so very bad after all. Admittedly 
there are complaints about the delay in recovering outstanding 
debts but on the whole it's no worse than here in the  HOME  TRADE. 
We don't have very many more overdue accounts than is usually 
the case in Italy. Indeed the fellows are starting to order more 
freely again. Admittedly our own article can't be regarded as an 
absolute criterion, but it nevertheless provides a few pointers. 
Business is still bad over there, of course, but not exceedingly so. 
But all that can still come. 
The Bonapartists must have become tremendously nervous. At 
Fould's bal masqué 75 sergents de ville b were ON THE  PREMISES  dressed 
as dominos. See the Guardian. 
Warmest regards to the whole FAMILY.

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 1 March 1858 
Dear Marx, 
On Wednesday, 24 February, I sent you a registered letter 
containing R/J  56641,  Manchester, 16 Jan. 1857; a five-pound 
note.  I trust that it reached you. If not,  STOP  PAYMENT  at the Bank 
IMMEDIATELY. This evening I shall also send DIVERSE Guardians; 
another batch went off last Wednesday at the same time as 
the letter. In today's you'll find some interesting stuff about 
Or si ni. 
The shabby way in which Pam, as he made his exit, unleashed 
all manner of political persecution—first Bernard and Allsop and 
now that poor devil of a  PUBLISHER"—was  quite a lark. But even 
this hasn't put John Bull off his TRULY BRITISH MINISTER,141  just a 
little grumbling here and there about the 2 cives Romani in 
Naples. 290 VERILY, the fellow has left an offensive stench behind 
him. 
In today's Guardian you will see that in Preston, etc., etc., SHORT 
TIME is still the order of the day. Will soon be general again. At 
present prices MANUFACTURERS are losing on most things, while 
spinners are just able to subsist, and to subsist well in the case of a 
few articles. As soon as rising prices CHECK demand (hitherto the 
fear of still higher prices has momentarily increased it), that too 
will cease and the fun begin all over again.

Dear Frederick, 
I sent  you by  return  a note acknowledging receipt  of the £5. The 
scrawl contained nothing else save  a few  political comments, 
ALTOGETHER  NOT  20 LINES.291  But all the same, I find it exceedingly 
irritating that  the  post office here should  be taking  an immediate 
interest  in my  correspondence.  Not  long  ago I  wrote  to Collet, that 
most respectable  of men,  and  the letter vanished. Complaints availed 
me nothing. I  SHALL NOW WATCH  THE  PROGRESS OF POST OFFICE INTERFERENCE.  If 
there  is a 3rd  CASE  of this kind  I shall proclaim  the  fact above  my 
signature  in the  London press.  The  canaille  are  welcome  to read 
what I write about  POLITICS.  But my  PRIVATE AFFAIRS  are not such that I 
would care  to have  any old  German  POST OFFICE SPY  go poking  his 
nose into them;  50  swine  of various nationalities  are, it  seems, 
regularly employed  as interpreters  by the  London cabinet noir? 92 AT 
LEAST,  THE  URQUHARTITES  SAY  so. 
The information I sent you recently about the  STATE  of TRADE  IN 
ITALY,  and  Milan  in particular,  was  taken from  the  Turin papers, 
which  are  well supplied with correspondents  in that region. While 
it is, of  course,  in the  interests  of Turin  to paint  the  situation  in 
Austrian Italy  in the  blackest possible colours,  the  reports from 
Milan went into details which  had the  real ring  of  truth.—As 
regards the  STATE  of FRENCH TRADE,  you should read the contribution 
from  the  Paris  CORRESPONDENT  in today's Times.* True,  the  chap  now 
seems  to be  blaming the thing  on Orsini and the  FRENCH COLONELS,  mais 
c'est ridicule. b 
I enclose  a wretched scrawl  by Pyat, Talandier  and  Co.,c which 
laddies couldn't rest  for the  fame accorded  to Ledru-Rollin  and 
Mazzini  and  Bernard, whereas they themselves  had  apparently 
been quite passed over  by the  French government. They believe 
that a revolution  is in the  offing  and  after  all  their 'activity'  in 
London—Talandier  had  shouted himself  as  hoarse  as quondam

Bornstedt —it was  INDEED  galling  for the  great  men to  have  the 
attention  of  revolutionary Europe diverted from them  by  other 
INCIDENTS.  Therefore,  JUST  IN THE  NICK  OF TIME,  THEY  ISSUED  the clap-trap 
enclosed herewith. 293 No  style,  no  sense,  not  even French, 
altogether  in the  style  of the  Porte  St.  Martin streetwalker  so 
typical  of the  former Charivari contributor  and  COMPOSITOR  of little 
TOASTS.294  In  order that this publication should  not  fail in its 
purpose, they sent  the  beastly little thing  to all the  PAPERS. 
Persigny-Palmerston Jenkins  OF  THE  MORNING  POST  was  instantly 
CAUGHT  in the  TRAP.  In a  LEADER  written  by himself  he denounced  the 
chaps  and  their opusculum  TO THE HONOURABLE  MR  WALPOLE  and,  as an 
additional precaution,  HE DID THE  WHOLE  PAMPHLET  INTO  BAD  ENGLISH.  More 
than that.  In his  INAUGURAL SPEECH  Derby informed  the  HOUSE  OF LORDS 
that the  CROWN  advocates  had  been instructed  to  look into  the 
thing  and  see if  legal proceedings could  be taken against  it.a In  this 
way  CITIZENS  Talandier, Pyat  and  Besson have, with their insane 
concoction, succeeded  in puffing themselves  TO A DEGREE  they could 
hardly have dared hope  for. >. 
As for  Bernard,  he  will presumably have  to spend  a little longer 
in jug. 
The insolence  and  IMPUDENCE  with which  Pam has  placed himself 
at the  head  of the  liberal opposition  and  nominated himself  an 
HONOURABLE  GENTLEMAN OPPOSITE,2  IS  TRULY WONDERFUL,  but he can, of 
course,  do  exactly what  he  pleases with  a House  of Commons  of 
his own  creation. 
Apropos.  Can you  tell me how  often machinery  has to be 
replaced  in, say,  your factory? Babbage maintains that  in 
Manchester  THE BULK OF MACHINERY IS  RENOVATED  on average  EVERY 5 YEARS.*1 
This seems  to me  somewhat  STARTLING  and not  QUITE TRUSTWORTHY. 
The average period  for the  replacement  of  machinery  is one 
important factor  in explaining  the  multi-year cycle which  has  been 
a feature  of industrial development ever since  the  consolidation  of 
big industry. 
What  is Lupus  up to?  Give  him my  regards.

Dear Moor, 
So once again the cabinet noir 292 has well and truly honoured 
you with its attentions. I had expected something of the sort but 
it's a bit steep to go and intercept letters. I think you would do 
better to have the address done in another hand, in which case 
they will only open the letters sent to you. I was expecting an 
acknowledgment from you and therefore took PARTICULAR care to 
ask our messenger daily and in so many words whether there were 
any letters for me—each time the answer was in the negative. And 
yet we have the asinine Félix Pyat announcing to the world qu'il n'y 
a pas de police politique proprement dite, en Angleterre." Rarely have I 
come across a more bungled concoction, style and all. 293 Still the 
same old faith in the Constitution of 1848; one might almost be 
face to face with our own jackasses of the Imperial Constitution.296 
And what a ghastly style! Après tout h the idiots have achieved their 
aim and will, perhaps, earn themselves a cheap form of 
martyrdom. Cette bête de c Derby, falling straight into the trap like 
that, and allowing the riff-raff to have their way. 
As to the question of machinery, it's difficult to say anything 
positive; at all events Babbaged is quite WRONG. The most reliable 
criterion is the PERCENTAGE by which a manufacturer writes down his

machinery each year for wear and tear and repairs, thus 
recovering the entire cost of his machines within a given period. 
This PERCENTAGE is normally 7'/2> in which case the machinery will 
be paid for over 13Vs years by an annual deduction from profits, 
i.e. will be replaceable without loss. E.g. I have £10,000 worth of 
machinery. At the end of the first year, when I draw up my 
balance-sheet, I enter 
from which I deduct V/2% for wear and £10,000 
tear » 750 
£9,250 
Expenditure on repairs £100 
Cost of machinery . £9,350 
At the end of the 2nd year I deduct 71/2% 
[of] £10,000, and 7V2% [of] £100 » 757 10 
£8,593 10 
Expenditure on repairs » 306 10 
Present cost of entire machinery £8,900 
etc. Now, I3V3 years is admittedly a long time in the course of 
which numerous bankruptcies and changes occur; you may enter 
other branches, sell your old machinery, introduce new improve­
ments, but if this calculation wasn't more or less right, practice 
would have changed it long ago. Nor does the old machinery that 
has been sold promptly become old iron; it finds takers among the 
small spinners, etc., etc., who continue to use it. We ourselves have 
machines in operation that are certainly 20 years old and, when 
one occasionally takes a glance inside some of the more ancient 
and ramshackle CONCERNS up here, one can see antiquated stuff that 
must be 30 years old at least. Moreover, in the case of most 
machines, only a few of the components wear out to the extent 
that they have to be replaced after 5 or 6 years. And even after 15 
years,  provided the basic principle of a machine has not been 
superseded by new inventions, there is relatively litde difficulty in 
replacing worn out parts (I refer here to spinning and flyer 
frames), so that it is hard to set a definite term on the effective life 
of such machinery.- Again, over the last 20 years improvements in 
spinning machinery have not been such as to preclude the

incorporation of almost all of them in the existing structure of the 
machines, since nearly all are minor innovations. (Admittedly, in 
the case of carding, the enlargement of the carding cylinder was a 
major improvement which supplanted the old machines where 
good qualities were concerned, but for ordinary qualities the old 
machinery will be perfectly adequate for a long time yet.) 
Babbage's assertion is so absurd that were it true, England's 
industrial capital must continually diminish and money simply be 
thrown away. A manufacturer who turns over his capital 5 times 
in 4 years, hence 6V4 times in 5 years, would, in addition to his 
average profit of 10%, have to earn annually a further 20% on 
approximately 3/4 of his capital (the machinery) if he was to recoup 
without loss his outlay on the old machinery—i.e. would have to 
make 25%. This would, of course, vastly increase the cost price of 
all articles—more, almost, than it would be increased by wages— 
in which case where is the advantage of machinery? Annual WAGES 
amount to perhaps Vs the cost of the machinery—undoubtedly 
less in the case of the smaller spinners and weavers, and wear and 
tear is supposed to amount to k—the thing is ludicrous. There is 
certainly not a single establishment in England in the regular  LINE 
of big industry which replaces its machinery in 5 years. Anyone 
foolish enough to do so would go to the wall at the first CHANGE; 
the old machines, even though much inferior, would certainly 
have the advantage over the modern ones and would be able to 
produce much more cheaply, for the market follows not the 
people who charge 15% for wear and tear on every pound of 
twist, but those who charge only 6% (approx. 4/5 of an annual 
depreciation of  7'/2%)  and hence sell at cheaper prices. 
Ten to twelve years are enough to bring about changes in the 
character of the  BULK  of machinery, thereby necessitating its 
replacement to a greater or lesser extent. The period of 13'/3 
years will vary, of course, depending on bankruptcies, breakage of 
essential parts where a repair would prove too expensive, and 
similar contingencies, so one could make it a bit shorter. But 
certainly not less than 10 years. 
I had finished 'Burmah' when I was ' ompelled to make DIVERSE 
necessary ADDITIONS from another source. So I haven't done with it 
yet and the thing will have to wait until Tuesday. It will run to 
nearly 3 pages. There are still a few details to be looked up for 
'Bomarsund'. On top of that I have to snatch whatever opportuni­
ty I can, since library hours are so similar to office hours that I 
can't always get there. As soon as I've dealt with these wretched

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 5 March 1858 
DEAR  Frederic, 
As regards the enclosed, which has clearly been delayed,297  you 
might be so good as to discuss with Lupus the kind of answer you 
think would be suitable. Don't return the thing (but keep it) 
because such things are safer with you than with me just now. At 
present London is a gathering-point for mouchards 3 of all nations. 
Hardly a day goes by when the curs aren't plus ou moins b lynched. 
MY BEST THANKS FOR YOUR éclaircissements' about machinery. The 
figure of 13 years corresponds closely enough to the theory, since 
it establishes a unit for  ONE  EPOCH  OF INDUSTRIAL REPRODUCTION which plus 
ou moins coincides with the period in which major crises recur; 
needless to say their course is also determined by factors of a quite 
different kind, depending on their period of reproduction. For 
me the important thing is to discover, in the immediate material 
postulates of big industry, one factor that determines cycles. In 
considering the reproduction of machinery, as distinct from capital 
circulant, one is irresistibly reminded of the Moleschotts who also 
pay insufficient attention to the period of reproduction of the 
bony skeleton, contenting themselves RATHER, like the economists, 
with the average time taken by the human body to replace itself 
completely. Another question in respect of which I require only 
one example (approximate), is how, e.g. in your own mill or RATHER

manufacturing business,  FLOATING CAPITAL  is apportioned over raw 
material  and  WAGES,  and  what portion  on  average  you  leave with 
your  BANKER.  Further,  how you  calculate turnover  in your books. 
Here  the  theoretical rules  are  extremely simple  and  SELF-EVIDENT. 
But it is  nevertheless just  as well  to have some inkling  of how the 
thing looks  in  practice.  The  method  of  calculation used  by 
businessmen  is, of  course,  PARTLY  based  on  illusions even greater 
than those  of the  economists;  on the  other hand  it rectifies  the 
latter's theoretical illusions  by means  of practical ones.  You  speak 
Of 10%  profit.  I SUPPOSE THAT YOU  DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT  THE  INTEREST 
and that this  is doubtless shown along with  the  profit.  IN  THE 'FIRST 
REPORT  OF  THE  FACTORY COMMISSIONERS'  I have found the following 
STATEMENT,  which serves  as an  average example: 
* Capital sunk  in building  and  machinery £10,000 
Floating capital  £  7,000 
£500 interest  on  10,000 fixed capital 
£350 interest  on  floating capital 
£150 Rents, taxes, rates 
£650 Sinking fund  of 6V2 p-c for  wear  and  tear of the 
fixed capital 
£1,650 
1,100 contingencies  (?),  carriage, coal,  oil 
£2,750 
£2,600 wages  and  salaries 
£5,350 
£10,000  for  about 400,000  lbs raw  cotton  at 6d 
£15,350* 
16,000 for 363,000  LBS  TWIST SPUN. VALUE  16,000. Profit 650, OR 
ABOUT  4.2  P.C.  Hence  WAGES  of OPERATIVES  here  ABOUT  Ve­
it is true that  in this case  the  total profit only amounts  to ABOUT 
10%,  including interest.  Mr  Senior, however,  who  after  all 
represents  the  manufacturers' interests, states that  in Manchester 
the average profit including interest amounts  to 15%. a It is a  great 
pity that  the  above  STATEMENT  does  not  show  the  number  of 
operatives,  or the  proportion  of actual  WAGES  to what appears  as 
SALARIES.

whenever they find themselves on the treadmill of bourgeois 
thought, struck me very forcibly in the following passage of 
Ricardo's, which I happened to come across yesterday. You will 
recall that A. Smith, who is still very old-fashioned, declares that 
by comparison with trade at home, overseas trade only gives  ONE 
HALF  OF THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE PRODUCTIVE LABOUR OF A COUNTRY ETC. To 
this Ricardo replies with the following example: 
'Smith's argument appears to me to be fallacious; for though two CAPITALS, one 
Portuguese and one English, be employed, as Smith supposes, still a capital will be 
EMPLOYED  in the foreign trade, double of what would be employed in the home 
trade. Suppose that Scotland employs a capital of a thousand pounds in making 
linen, which she exchanges for the produce of a similar capital employed in making 
silks in England, two thousand pounds, and a proportional quantity of labour will 
be employed by the two countries. Suppose now, that England discovers that she 
can import more linen from Germany, for the silks which she before exported to 
Scotland, and that Scotland discovers that she can obtain more silks from France in 
return for her linen, than she before obtained from England,—will not England 
and Scotland immediately cease trading with each other, and will not the home trade 
of consumption be changed for a foreign trade of consumption? But although two 
additional capitals will enter into this trade, the capital of Germany and that of France, 
will not the same amount of Scotch and of English capital continue to be employed, 
and will it not give motion to the same quantity of industry as when it was engaged in 
the home trade?'3 
The assumption that in such circumstances Germany would buy 
her silks in England instead of France, and France her linen in 
Scotland instead of Germany is hardly what one would expect  OF A 
FELLOW  LIKE  RICARDO. 
Friend Thomas Tooke has died, and with him the last English 
economist  OF ANY  VALUE. 
Did you overlook, in one of the Guardians you sent me, the item 
in which David Urquhart figures as an infanticide? The  FOOL 
treated his 13-month-old baby to a Turkish bath which, as chance 
would have it, contributed to congestion of the brain and hence its 
subsequent DEATH. The  CORONER'S  INQUEST  on this CASE lasted for 3 days 
and it was only by the skin of his teeth that Urquhart escaped a 
verdict OF MANSLAUGHTER. Quel triomphe pour 0 Pam.

to Buenos Aires at the beginning of the century, but it was a glorious 
one and would be worth investigating. He capitulated, RUMP AND STUMP,

'Bülow' is IN HAND. Ditto 'Cavalry'. Still some particulars to be 
looked up on 'Bomarsund'. In India there's another article 
brewing for which I shall be on the qui vive. 
Charras' Campagne de 1815 is no longer obtainable in Brussels; 
said to be out of print and with no definite prospect of a reprint. 
In other words, Bonaparte has bought the publisher. b If you can 
run to ground a cheap (i. e. not exorbitant) copy in London, I'd 
like you to let me know; just now I'm studying this campaign. 
I suspect that friend Dana is abridging our articles considerably, 
otherwise you couldn't possibly have miscalculated so badly. Go to 
Trübner's some time and have a look at the Cyclopaedia. 
No news here, except that it's a ghastly winter; the weather

Dear Lassalle, 
I was confined to bed when your letter arrived, [hence]" the 
delay in replying. Now I am  ALL  RIGHT  again. D'abord^ whatever the 
outcome of the NEGOTIATION initiated] by you, whether successful 
or otherwise, I would like to express my warmest thanks for your 
exertions whose value is doubled by the fact that you yourself 
were in poor health. I hope that you are now perfectly well again. 
Friend Quételet c has calculated that, after Petersburg and Madrid, 
Berlin is the most insalubrious capital in Europe—as, indeed, 
having lived there 5 years, I personally can confirm by comparison 
with London, Brussels and Paris. 
But to come to business. You will, perhaps, permit me to reply 
to question 4 first and then proceed in reverse. 
1. The publisher shall have the right to cease publication on 
receipt of the second instalment, always provided I am given due 
notice. A proper contract, assuming he intends to publish more 
than one instalment, shall not be concluded before delivery of the 
third.d 
2. As regards the fee, I shall, if necessary, agree to a minimum 
of 0 for the first instalment, for while I certainly cannot write the 
whole work gratis, I am even less prepared to see its publication 
come to grief over the question of money. I have no idea what 
authors are paid in Germany. But if you do not think 30 talers 
per sheet is too much, that is what you should ask,—less, if 
you think it excessive. Once the thing has been launched we 
shall see on what conditions the publisher can and will go on 
with it.

3. Minimum length of the instalments  SAY 4 sheets; maximum 6. 
It is to be desired, of course, that each instalment should form 
a relative whole. But the separate sections vary greatly in 
length. 
Whatever the circumstances, the first instalment would have to 
constitute a relative whole and, since it lays the foundations for all 
that follows, it could hardly be done in under 5 or 6 sheets. But 
that is something I shall find out when I come to finish it off. It 
contains 1. Value, 2. Money, 3. Capital in General (the process of 
production of capital; process of its circulation; the unity of the 
two, or capital and profit; interest). This constitutes a pamphlet in 
its own right. As you yourself will have discovered from your 
economic studies, Ricardo's exposition of profit conflicts with his 
(correct) definition of value, thus giving rise among his followers 
either to a complete departure from his basis, or to the most 
objectionable eclecticism. I believe that I have cleared the matter 
up. (On closer examination the economists will, to be sure, find 
that ALTOGETHER IT IS A DIRTY BUSINESS.) 
4. As to the total number of sheets I am myself very much in the 
dark since, in my notebooks, the material for the work is entirely 
in the form of monographs,250 many of which go into a wealth of 
detail that would disappear in the course of compilation. Nor is it 
my intention to elaborate to an equal degree all the 6 books into 
which I am dividing the whole, but rather to give no more than 
the broad outline in the last 3, whereas in the first 3, which contain 
the actual nub of the economic argument, some degree of 
amplification will be unavoidable. I hardly think that the whole 
can be done in under 30 or 40 sheets. 
With kind regards.

Dear Moor, 
The letter with enclosure from New York" arrived here

For the same reason I haven't yet been able to see Lupus and at

only sources I have, by the way, are Siborne and Jomini.a For

Dear Moor, 
When you get this letter and today's Guardian, sent off at the 
same time, give your wife the Paris report to read. It gives one 
quite a turn to hear a Bonapartist and official relate how 100,000 
ouvriers 11 in the Faubourg St. Antoine responded to Orsini's 
execution 271 with the cry 'Vive la République'? So deportations and 
arrests à tort et à travers* have borne as little fruit as the cités 
ouvrières' and the national ateliers en gros, g and it is gratifying, on 
the eve of the grand ball, to see such a roll-call take place and hear 
a W. Siborne, History of the War in France and Belgium, in 1815; A. H. Jomini, Vie 
politique et militaire de Napoléon... - b we shall see - c workers - d Long live the

=====第324页=====
290 154. Engels to Marx. 17 March 1858 
100,000 men reply, 'Present!' I'm only sorry Orsini couldn't 
hear that cry. 
A local philistine who was lately in Paris has returned with the 
news that since Orsini's attempt on Monsieur Boustrapa's40  life 
two more had been made. The first was also mentioned in the 
English press; the fellow was arrested in the Bois de Boulogne at 
the moment he took aim with his pistol; the second was news to 
me; it appears that the fellow shot at or tried to stab him in the 
Tuileries gardens and was summarily shot by soldiers of the 
Guard in the gallery of June 1848 fame beneath the terrasse du 
bord de l'eau.'* 0'1 
It seems that all threadbare patriotic notables want to make fools 
of themselves: mad old Landor must needs go and write to The 
Times today.302 All that remains now is for Venedey to protest 
against Orsini. 
But Boustrapa has indeed come to a pretty pass, and it is a pity 
that the Constitutionnel should no longer be in a position to declare 
that l'horizon politique s'obscurcit. b95 What could be funnier than to 
find in the Moniteur, no less, a story about the officers at Châlon 
who,  before risking rank and skin for the empereur, hurried to the 
sous-préfet to ask whether or not a republic had really been 
proclaimed in Paris? c But one can also see how, even in the army, 
the only genuine Bonapartists are the men at the top because 
these are compromised and lured on by the prospect of truly 
splendid bounties. For, after all, what has Boustrapa to offer the 
bulk of subalterns? The blackguard doubtless knows as well as we 
do that, aside from his Guard, there are few troops he can rely on. 
Unfortunately the Guard is strong and knows that, under any 
other government, it would either be relegated to the line or 
disbanded. It consists, as far as infantry is concerned, of 4 
regiments of grenadiers, 2 of riflemen, 1 of gendarmes, 1 of 
Zouaves, 1 battalion of light infantry (17 infantry battalions all 
told);  further, 2 regiments of cuirassiers, 2 of dragoons, 1 of 
mounted grenadiers, 1 of hussars, 1 of chasseurs—21 squadrons 
and a strong force of artillery. In all 18,000-20,000 men with 
40-50 cannon, a nucleus solid enough to stiffen a somewhat 
wavering line. In addition everything has been so organised as to 
provide for a speedy concentration of troops from the Provinces 
(you only have to look at a railway map of France) so that a 
movement, if anticipated, would undoubtedly find itself confronted 
by 60,000-80,000 men. Victory over such vast numbers is to be 
a waterside terrace - b the political horizon is lowering - c  'A Chalon-sur-Saône, dans 
la soirée...', Le Moniteur universel, No. 68, 9 March 1858.

achieved in 2 ways only: either by secret societies within the army 
itself—and these are said to be numerous—or by a determined 
anti-Bonapartist stand on the part of the bourgeoisie, as in 
February.3 I don't believe that victory is possible in the absence of 
one, let alone both, of these conditions. There is no doubt that the 
lower echelons of the army are undermined by reds and the 
higher by Orleanists124 and Legitimists,303  nor that the loi des 
suspects 304 in conjunction with other repressive measures is making 
life impossible for the bourgeoisie. Boustrapa's mounting difficul­
ties are daily forcing him into ever more desperate straits; he dare 
not risk war with Prussia, he has shut himself out of Italy; no one 
any longer believes in Boustrapian socialism; Algeria has no more 
campaigns to offer. All diversions being excluded, reste la répression 
croissante?' i. e. the virtual driving of the bourgeoisie into 
revolution. For the Orleanists and Legitimists the restoration of 
the constitutional republic under their joint rule must already be 
LOOMING IN THE DISTANCE as the most probable pis aller c should 
circumstances not hold out an immediate prospect of victory for 
either party. Le cas de soulèvement donné d—and it's bound to come 
in the course of this year—there is every chance that they will 
follow the pattern of February 1848, sauf o lancer plus tard les 
troupes sur les faubourgs? And we know what will happen then. As 
soon as their fear of Bonaparte has made the troops unsteady 
enough to render the success of the insurrection inevitable, their 
fear of the prolétaires will make them induce the troops to put 
down the insurrection— trop tard f!—the flood will surge over 
them regardless, the troops will stand gaping—and then we shall 
see how much ground the water has gained since the last 
springtide of 1848. 
Fortunately commerce in France is in such a state that it cannot 
improve until the chronic crisis has culminated in political 
revolution. I don't believe that the state of trade in France can 
possibly improve so long as Boustrapa remains at the helm. While 
the crisis lasts all the talk about 'confidence' being undermined by 
Orsini, Espinasse, etc., is mere idle euphemism; but under a 
régime of this nature it will become sober truth should the 
conditions responsible for the crisis cease to obtain. By the way, I 
have quite come round to your opinion that in France the Crédit 
mobilier 45 was no haphazard swindle but an altogether necessary 
institution, and that Morny's pilferings which it spawned were no 
a i.e. during the February Revolution of 1848 - b there remains growing repression -
c expedient - d Given an insurrection - c save that later they may send troops against 
the suburbs - f too late 

=====第326页=====
292 154. Engels to Marx. 17 March 1858 
less inevitable, for it was only the prospect of getting rich quick 
which made the Credit mobilier viable in France. Under these 
circumstances it's a TOSS-UP which falls first—Boustrapa or the 
Crédit mobilier. — The prolongation of bills must inevitably give 
rise to enormous losses. The use of such means to overcome a 
crisis can be of avail only if the reprise des affaires a is a real one in 
industry too, but the mere fact of an  EASY  MONEY-MARKET cannot help 
anyone who has no credit—and I believe that in France credit is 
no longer accorded save by prolonging what has already been 
given. 
Things in Prussia look pretty rotten to me. The tinpot litde 
Chamber has greatly inflamed the parochial Prussian patriotism of 
the philistines there and even the arch-philistine, I fear, looks 
forward with assurance to the advent, along with the English 
marriage,305 of an English constitution, albeit democratised. If only 
the corporalb  were to make a fool of  himself,  and that right soon! 
In Prussia, I fear, it won't be too easy to get rid of the ROYAL 
FAMILY—unless,  that is, the proletariat has made really enormous 
strides. The bourgeois and philistines have, at any rate, got even 
worse since 1848. In German Austria, too, nothing much seems to 
be happening. Plainly your good, honest German has not yet 
emerged from the hibernation that followed the strenuous 
exertions of 1848. Slav insurrections and the loss of Hungary and 
Italy will, by the way, serve their turn in Austria, and on top of 
that, in the big towns and industrial districts, the crisis will have 
repercussions which, just now and at this distance, are impossible

But what if Boustrapa were to subdue the first big attempt at an 
uprising? I regard this as practically impossible, precisely because 
the measures he has adopted are such that things would not 
become serious save on a really major occasion. But supposing 
Boustrapa were to succeed, he'd be doubly in the soup. Pélissier 
would be empereur. The troops of the line, who would in any case 
show signs of weakness and irresolution, would be declared non 
grata and the Guard alone remain in favour—indeed more so 
than ever before. A sure means of fostering conspiracy in the 
army. Next, Boustrapa would have to go directly for the Orleanists 
and Legitimists, nor would Thiers get away with a couple of days 
in the Mazas burnishing his Brown Bess. 306 A sure means of 
utterly ruining commerce. If Boustrapa were ever to triumph, his 
downfall would be all the more assured.

believe things would turn out in the way Morny once described to 
him: 'Nous commencerions par jeter tous les Jérôme par la

DEAR  Frederic, 
The £5  most gratefully received. 
Today  a letter from Lassalle.a  Duncker  is prepared  to publish 
my political economy  on the  following conditions. Every  few 
months  I am to  supply instalments  of 3 to 6  sheets (this  was my 
suggestion).  He is to  have  the  right  to cancel  the  arrangement  at 
the third instalment. Indeed,  no  contract  is to be  definitely 
concluded until then.  In the  meantime  he is to pay 3  fried-
richsdors  per  sheet. (According  to Lassalle, professors  in Berlin 
get only  2) The  first instalment b is to be  READY  at the end of  May, 
i. e. the  manuscript. 
In my  next I must  let you  have  an outline  of the  first instalment 
so that  you can  tell me  what  you  think  of it. For the  past  two 
weeks  I have again been  VERY SICKLY  and  have been taking medicine 
for my  liver.  I have been much subject  to relapses  of late owing  to 
prolonged work  by  night  and, by day, a  multitude  of  petty 
annoyances  RESULTING FROM  THE  ECONOMICAL CONDITIONS  OF MY  DOMESTICITY.

consideration Bonaparte decided  THAT THIS WOULD  BE IN  FACT  AN

whereby  the  Spanish institution  of  CAPTAIN-GENERALSHIP 309 has  been 
introduced into France lock, stock  and  barrel.  Now  doesn't this 
imply  a collapse  of centralisation  and,  IN FACT,  a diminution  of the

boasting  on the  other side  of the  Channel were  to continue, these

of the  kind.

298 158. Marx to Engels. 2 April 1858 
The following is a SHORT OUTLINE  OF THE  FIRST  PART.  The whole thing 
is to be divided into 6 books: 1. On Capital. 2. Landed Property. 
3. Wage Labour. 4. State. 5. International Trade. 6. World 
Market. 
1. Capital falls into 4 sections, a) Capital en general. (This is the 
substance of the first instalment.) b) Competition, or the interaction of 
many capitals, c) Credit, where capital, as against individual 
capitals, is shown to be a universal element, d) Share capital as the 
most perfected form (turning into communism) together with all 
its contradictions. The transition from capital to landed property is 
also historical, since landed property in its modern form is a 
product of the action of capital on feudal, etc., landed property. In 
the same way, the transition of landed property to wage labour is 
not only dialectical but historical, since the last product of modern 
landed property is the general introduction of wage labour, which 
then appears as the basis of the whole business. 
WELL (IT IS DIFFICULT FOR  ME TO-DAY TO WRITE), let us now come to the 
corpus delicti.* 
I. Capital. First section: Capital in general. (Throughout this 
section wages are invariably assumed to be at their minimum. 
Movements in wages themselves and the rise and fall of that 
minimum will be considered under wage labour. Further, landed 
property is assumed to be zero, i. e. landed property as a special 
economic relation is of no relevance as yet. Only by this procedure 
is it possible to discuss one relation without discussing all the 
rest.) 
1. Value. Simply reduced to the quantity of labour; time as a 
measure of labour. Use-value—whether regarded subjectively as 
the USEFULNESS of labour, or objectively as the UTILITY of the 
product—is shown here simply as the material prerequisite of 
value, and one which for the present is entirely irrelevant to the 
formal economic definition. Value as such has no 'substance' other 
than actual labour. This definition of value, first outlined by Petty 
and neatly elaborated by Ricardo,b is simply bourgeois wealth in its 
most abstract form. As such, it already presupposes 1. the 
transcending of indigenous communism (India, etc.), 2. of all 
undeveloped, pre-bourgeois modes of production which are not in 
every respect governed by exchange. Although an abstraction, it is 
an historical abstraction and hence feasible only when grounded 
on a specific economic development of society. All objections to 
a the incriminating evidence. Here, the main topic. - b  W. Petty, A Treatise of Taxes 
and Contributions...; D. Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy,and Taxation.

this definition of value derive either from less developed relations 
of production or else are based on confused thinking, whereby the 
more concrete economic definitions from which value has been 
abstracted (and which may therefore also be seen, on the other 
hand, as a further development of the same) are upheld as against 
value in this its abstract, undeveloped form. In view of the 
uncertainty of messieurs les économistes themselves about the precise 
relation of this abstraction to later, more concrete forms 
of bourgeois wealth, these objections were plus ou moins 3 
justified. 
The contradiction between the general characteristics of value 
and its material existence in a particular commodity, etc.—these 
general characteristics being the same as those later appearing in 
money—gives rise to the category of money. 
2. Money. 
Some discussion of precious metals as vehicles of the money 
relation. 
a) Money as a measure. A few comments on the ideal measure in 
Steuart, Attwood,310 Urquhart; in more comprehensible form 
among the advocates of labour money (Gray, Bray,b etc. An 
occasional swipe at the Proudhonists). The value of a commodity 
translated into money is its price. For the moment price appears 
only in this purely formal distinction between it and value. Thus, 
in accordance with the general law of value, a specific amount of 
money merely expresses a specific amount of objectified labour. In 
so far as money is a measure, the variability of its own value is of 
no importance. 
b) Money as a means of exchange, or simple circulation. 
Here we need only consider the simple form of circulation as 
such. All the other conditions by which it is determined are 
external to it, and hence will not be considered till later 
(presuppose more highly developed relations). If the commodity 
be C and money M then, although simple circulation evinces the 
two circuits or final points: C— M—M—C and M—C—C—M 
(this latter constituting the transition to c), the point of departure 
and the point of return in no way coincide, save by chance. Most 
of the so-called laws put forward by economists do not consider 
money circulation within its own confines, but as subsumed 
under, and determined by, higher movements. All this must be set 
a more or less - b Marx means the following works: J. Steuart, An Inquiry into the 
Principles of Political Oeconomy...; D. Urquhart, Familiar Words...; J. Gray, Lectures on 
the Nature and Use of Money, The Social System...; J. F. Bray, Labour's Wrongs and 
Labour's Remedy....

302 158. Marx to Engels. 2 April 1858 
aside. (Belongs in part to the theory of credit; but also calls for 
consideration where money appears again, but further defined.) 
Here, then, money as means of circulation (coin). But likewise as 
realisation (not simply evanescent) of price. From the simple 
statement that a commodity, in terms of price, has already been 
exchanged for money in theory before it is so exchanged in fact, 
there naturally follows the important economic law that the volume 
of the circulating medium is determined by prices, not vice versa. (Here, 
some historical stuff on the polemic concerning this point.) Again 
it follows that velocity may be a substitute for volume, but that a 
certain volume is essential to simultaneous acts of exchange in so 
far as the relation of these themselves is not that of + and —, an 
equalisation and consideration which will only be touched on at 
this juncture by way of anticipation. At this point I shall not go 
further into the development of this section and would only add 
that the lack of congruence of  C — M and M — C is the most 
abstract and superficial form in which the possibility of crises is 
expressed. If the law concerning the determination of circulating 
volume by prices be developed, it will be found that the 
assumptions made here are by no means applicable to all states of 
society; hence the fatuity of comparing e.g. the influx of money 
from Asia into Rome and its effect on prices there tout bonnement" 
with modern commercial relations. On closer examination, the 
most abstract definitions invariably point to a broader, definite, 
concrete, historical basis. (OF COURSE, since to the extent that they 
are definite they have been abstracted therefrom.) 
c) Money qua money. This is a development of the formula 
M — C — C — M. Money, the independent existence of value as 
opposed to circulation; material existence of abstract wealth. 
Already manifested in circulation in so far as it appears, not only 
as a means of circulation, but as realising price. In this capacity c), 
in which a) and b) appear to be no more than functions, money is 
the universal commodity of contracts (here the variability of its 
value acquires importance: value being determined by labour 
time);  it becomes an object of HOARDING. (This would still seem to be 
an important function in Asia, as formerly in the ancient world 
and in the Middle Ages GENERALLY. Now persists only in a 
subordinate capacity within the banking system. In times of crisis 
money in this form again acquires importance. In this form money 
considered along with the world-historical DELUSIONS which it 
engenders, etc. Destructive properties, etc.) As the realisation of all 
a just like that 

=====第337页=====
158. Marx to Engels. 2 April 1858 303 
higher forms in which value will appear; definitive forms in which 
all relations of value are externally concluded. Money, however, 
once fixed in this form, ceases to be an economic relation which is 
lost in its material medium, gold and silver. On the other hand, in 
so far as money comes into circulation and is again exchanged for 
C, the final process, the consumption of the commodity, again falls 
outside the economic relation. The principle of self-reproduction 
is not intrinsic to simple money circulation, which therefore 
implies something extrinsic to  itself.  Implicit in money—as the 
elaboration of its definitions shows—is the postulate capital, i.e. 
value entering into and maintaining itself in circulation, of which 
it is at the same time the prerequisite. This transition also 
historical. The antediluvian form of capital is commercial capital, 
which always generates money. At the same time the emergence of 
real capital, either from money or merchant capital, which gains 
control of production. 
d) This simple circulation, considered as such—and it consti­
tutes the surface of bourgeois society in which the underlying 
operations which gave rise to it are obliterated—evinces no 
distinction between the objects of exchange, save formal and 
evanescent ones. Here we have the realm of liberty, equality and of 
property based on 'labour'. Accumulation, as it appears here in the 
form of HOARDING, is merely greater thrift, etc. On the one hand 
then, the fatuity of the economic harmonists, modern free traders 
(Bastiat, Carey," etc.), in upholding this most superficial and most 
abstract relation of production as their truth, as against the more 
advanced relations and their antagonisms. Fatuity of the 
Proudhonists and suchlike socialists, in contrasting the ideas of 
equality, etc., corresponding to this exchange of equivalents (or 
presumed  AS  SUCH), to the inequalities, etc., to which this exchange 
reverts and from which it emanates. In this sphere, appropriation 
by labour, the exchange of equivalents, appears as the law of 
appropriation so that exchange simply returns the same value in 
another material form. In short, while everything may be 'lovely' 
here,  it will soon come to a sticky end and this as a result of the 
law of equivalence. For now we come to 
' 3. Capital. 
This is really the most important part of the first instalment and 
one on which I particularly need your opinion. But today I can't 
go on writing. My bilious trouble makes it difficult for me to ply

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 9 April 1858 
Dear Moor, 
The study of your ABSTRACT of the first half'•instalment a has 
greatly exercised me; IT  IS A VERY  ABSTRACT ABSTRACT  INDEED—inevitably 
so, in view of its brevity,—and I often had to search hard for the 
dialectical transitions, particularly since  ALL  ABSTRACT  REASONING  is now 
completely foreign to me. The arrangement of the whole into 6 
books could hardly be better and seems to me an excellent idea, 
although the dialectical transition from landed property to wage 
labour is not yet quite clear to me. The development of the 
monetary business, too, is really excellent, though again there are 
individual bits I can't quite make out, at least until I have looked 
up the historical background. However, I think that I shall get a 
better idea of the DRIFT when I've had the last part of capital in 
general, and shall then write to you at greater length about it. The 
abstract, dialectical tone of your synopsis will, of course, disappear 
in the development. 
Yesterday I sent you two more Guardians. Now that the price 
has been reduced to Id, the chaps are evidently cutting down on 
all expenses such as foreign correspondents, etc. Their attempt to 
produce a FIRST-CLASS PROVINCIAL PAPER failed completely. Hence the 
dearth of foreign news and the rarity of contributions from Paris.

The thing about Fould in yesterday's Guardian isn't bad. But 
what's even better is the COTTON SUPPLY ASSOCIATION'S 311 report. How 
splendid that, 10 years after its introduction,  FREE  TRADE150 should 
be repudiated outright by the free traders themselves. For all that 
this COTTON SUPPLY ASSOCIATION amounts to is an institution set up by 
these selfsame free traders with the object of boosting the 
cultivation of cotton everywhere in the world where soil and 
climate are not entirely unsuitable—and this, in direct opposition 
to FREE TRADE  principles, by means of rewards, advances, gifts of 
seed, loans of machinery, etc., etc. If the State does something of 
this sort, it's all wrong, but if the MANCHESTER COTTON SPINNERS, who 
are much further removed from the NIGGERS, Bedouins, etc., in 
Africa than their own monarch, do the selfsame thing, then  ITS ALL 
RIGHT. This report is as pretty a satire on laissez-faire3™ clap-trap 
generally as one could hope to find. Very pretty, too, the 
admission that the import of English goods manufactured from 
American cotton has disrupted cotton cultivation in almost all 
other countries and that this last will now have to be restored by 
artificial means! These wretched English regard their monopoly in 
cotton spinning and weaving as something fine and natural to 
which no one could object; whereas the cotton-growing monopoly 
of the United States, engendered by the selfsame world market, 
must be smashed, even if this means  ANTI-FREE  TRADE  measures. The 
thing ought to be called  * Association for enabling the single 
spinners to buy cotton in the dearest market, the collective 
spinners paying the producer the difference between the market 
value and his cost of production  *. Of course, this is to go on only 
until subsidised cotton growing can stand on its own legs; but after 
all that is exactly what Monsieur List is also seeking to do with his 
protective tariffs! The thing might supply you with material for an 
article, since the Yankees have a direct interest in it and the 
Tribune,  too, is  ANTI-FREE TRADE. 
My prognostications that fluctuations in produce would be 
entirely dependent on the east and west winds and that, with 
MIDDLING ORLEANS COTTON above 6d, there could be no question of 
trade being either normal or brisk, have proved remarkably 
accurate.3 As regards cotton, the fulfilment of my first prognosti­
cation will be apparent from the enclosed table which is a 
continuation of the one I sent you earlier on the price of Middling 
Orleans, and brings it up to date.b Sugar, coffee and tea have gone 
a See this volume, pp. 202, 213, 235-36, 239-40. - •> Ibid., p. 205. The continuation of

the same  way,  save that  the  existence  of  considerable stocks 
inhibited  the  temporary steep rise which  the  shortage  of stocks 
made possible  in the  case  of  cotton.  As for the  second 
prognostication, there's still quite a lot of  SHORT TIME, STRIKES,  and 
stoppages  due to  unprofitable production  and,  since  the  crop will 
provide 3,000  Ma  bales whereas full production would  now 
demand  a minimum  of  3,500  M (same ratio  for  other cotton 
producing countries),  any  attempt  at revival  by the  cotton industry 
up to the end of  this year will  be hampered—quite aside from 
political convulsions—by  the  rising price  of raw  material,  as 
indeed already happened  at the end of  February  and the 
beginning  of March  (see  table). Prices  in general—even though 
there  may be an  initial fall—will rise,  but at the  same time there 
will be a  CHECK  to production proportionate  to the  rise. This, always 
SUPPOSING THAT [THERE  is] NO ROW  ON THE  CONTINENT,  though the latter is a 
virtual certainty. 
In one  week,  19-26  February, only  62  bales  of cotton  of all 
qualities arrived  in  Liverpool! Normally they  are  counted  in 
thousands. 
What's this about  the 300  million francs which  are  admitted  to 
have vanished?  All I  remember having read  is that, instead  of a 
surplus  of 40  million, Magne  has a  deficit—but  I don't know  the 
details.  It really  is priceless.  Now the  'prince impérial*'  is also  to 
be given his own household and a  dotation—CASH  MUST  BE DEVIUSH 
SCARCE! 
I hope your bilious trouble  is better. Obviously  all this excitation 
caused  by the  crisis  is to  blame.  In the  evenings  I am  sometimes 
plagued  by  toothache  as a  result  of the  weather;  but  nothing 
worse. 
Kind regards  to your wife  and  children.

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 14 April 1858 
Dear Mrs Marx, 
I trust that Moor is at last on the road to recovery and will soon 
be able to return unhampered to his labours on political 
economy.250 I was also plagued with toothache last week. By 
Sunday it had gone, only to return with added virulence this 
evening just as I was settling down to sort out some preliminary 
stuff on the conquest of Lucknowa  for the Tribune. Whether I 
shall succeed in these circumstances seems very doubtful. At any 
rate I shall try and read up the subject this evening and if possible 
concoct something, even if not much, tomorrow midday while I'm 
at the office. But it would at any rate be a good idea if Moor were 
to have a sujet in petto so that, if the worst comes to the worst, 
there's something to send the fellows. 
I still find working in the evenings very tiring and, if I go on for 
too long or for two evenings running, I get over-excited and 
suffer from insomnia, particularly when I've had a lot of writing 
to do during the day. And I also feel very stupid and lethargic in 
the evenings until I wake myself up by forcing myself to 
concentrate on some subject. My memory is better on the whole, 
although every day I still find that things I have done or heard 
the day before vanish so completely from my mind that they 
might never have happened, and it's only when I've been 
reminded of individual details that it all comes back to me. 
Otherwise I am physically strong and healthy again, able to stand 
up to strains and stresses and— sauf le c TOOTHACHE—to  any kind of 
weather. 
Lupus is still very lame and is having to spend more on  CABS  in 
one week than he usually does in a year. But he is improving 
visibly and in a week's time he'll probably again be able to stand a 
certain amount of walking. He sends everyone his best wishes.

open bits of the historical section for the present until I can 
unearth the relevant sources, and shall get on with the tactical 
side.  The article will probably take up 10 or 12 of my long double 
pages,  and maybe more. 
The affaire Bernard314  will greatly mortify Monsieur Bonaparte 
and make quite an impression on the refugee crapauds in 
London. James' speech, by the way, was feeble and décousu 3 and as 
usual old Campbell's summing up went against the PRISONER. The 
old donkey is vexed at losing the chance of an interesting legal 
case when he could have presided over 15 other judges. 
The revelations made by Cavour and La Marmorab about their 
relations with Cavaignac and the latter's fear of Austria315  will be 
of interest to the républicains purs. The more that comes to light 
about the National's period of supremacy, the more pitiful it 
seems.

DEAR  Frederick, 
My long silence can be explained in one word—inability to

LITERARY, but IN THE LITERAL SENSE OF THE WORD. The few obligatory 
articles for the Tribune" were dictated to my wife, but even that 
was only possible by  APPLYING  STRONG  STIMULI.  Never before have I had

fear that it might be sclerosis of the liver. The doctor wanted me 
to travel but  d'abord*  that was incompatible with the  STATE  OF FINANCE, 
and secondly I hoped from day to day to be able to start work 
again. The persistent urge to get down to WORK coupled with 
inability to do so helped aggravate my condition. However there's 
been an improvement during the past week. But I'm not yet 
capable of working. Whenever I sit down and write for a couple of 
hours I have to lie quite fallow for a couple of days. I hope 
to heaven that this state of affairs comes to an end next 
week. It couldn't have happened at a more inconvenient time.

A book has appeared by Louis Blanc on the revolution of 1848.c 
Evinces the most candid admiration for the 'petit'd which, or so he 
says,  is what the workers call him. If read carefully, however, it 
makes the fellow look an ass for it shows that on every crucial 
occasion the workers acted without his knowledge or consent and 
generally returned him sentiment for 'sentiment', taking the view 
that they had thereby paid the oracle of Luxembourg his FULL 
PRICE.316 
The movement for the emancipation of the serfs in Russia 
strikes me as important in so far as it indicates the beginning of an 
internal development that might run counter to the country's 
traditional foreign policy. Herzen, of course, has discovered afresh 
that 'liberty' has emigrated from Paris to Moscow.

the journey, come up straight away. We shall immediately send off

get a POST OFFICE ORDER today. I shall give the necessary instructions 
when I get home this evening. Come straight to No 6 Thorncliffe

(there's a train at about 5 o'clock), let me know on Monday 
morning when you are arriving and I'll pick you up at the

If you are arriving on Sunday, telegraph me tomorrow—it costs

I have just received your note dated the 3rd. 
After the death of my friend, Conrad Schramm,188 I instructed 
Mr Harney to return to us, not you, the letters from Marx and

were surprised at the indifference you showed towards his 
financial circumstances. 
In so far as I had anything to say about the disposal of Conrad's 
effects, I have said it to his only possible executor, Mr Harney. 
As to my 'sense of justice', which has nothing whatever to do 
with the case, you may perhaps have occasion to become better 
acquainted with it some day in Germany. 
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

Dear Mrs Marx, 
Moor has been out riding for two hours today and feels so well 
after it that he's waxing quite enthusiastic about the thing. He has 
left town and gone home, and has asked me to drop you a line 
about that fool Cluss.a  He thinks it might be a good thing for you 
to go and see Pfänder, who would probably elicit something from 
him. The main thing is that Monsieur Cluss should come up here, 
for we have got to know how we stand with him, and either he 
must declare himself IN  A SATISFACTORY MANNER or else we must break 
with him. What good is the ass to us if he's so unreliable as first to 
come to you, his heart brimful and overflowing, stay for 3 hours 
with no other apparent object than to get back on to the old 
footing again, and then suddenly write you a letter as confused as 
it is ill-bred in which he retracts? We're only sorry that, in the 
midst of what is a far from rosy spell, such dolts should come and 
add to your troubles.

Dear Lassalle, 
Post tot discrimina rerum*  at long last  a sign  of life.  As for 
me, what's been happening since  my  wife wrote  to you b is simply 
this: 
Having been totally incapable  of writing—not only IN  A LITERARY, 
BUT IN THE LITERAL  SENSE  OF THE WORD—for several weeks,  and  striven  in 
vain to rebel against  my  illness; having, moreover, been pumped 
full of medicine  and all  TO NO USE, I was  positively assured  by my 
doctor that  I must have  a change  of air,  secondly that  I must  DROP 
all INTELLECTUAL LABOUR FOR  SOME  TIME  and, finally, engage in riding as 
the main form  of treatment.  In itself  the  illness wasn't danger­
ous—enlargement  of the  liver—but  on this occasion  the  accom­
panying symptoms were particularly revolting; moreover,  in my 
family  it has  nasty implications  in that  it was the  starting-point  of 
the illness which  led to my  father's death. WELL. With  the  utmost 
reluctance  I eventually gave  way to the  insistence  of doctor  and 
family, joined Engels  in Manchester, 318 went  in for  riding  and 
other physical EXERCISES  and,  after spending  a month  up  there, 
finally returned  to London fully restored.  The  illness—altogether 
a very expensive LUXURY  in my  circumstances—was  all the  more 
inopportune  in that  I had  already begun  to prepare  the  first 
instalment0  for  publication.  I shall  now  settle down  to this with  a 
will. I trust  you  will be so  kind  as to  tell the  publisherd  all about 
these ADVENTURES.  YOU  will readily  be able  to imagine  the  state  of 
mind  I was in  during  my  illness when  I tell  you  that liver 
complaints  as such tend  to make  one  hypochondriacal  and  that,  in 
addition,  my  life  was  bedevilled  by all  manner  of domestic 
circumstances,  not to  speak  of the  hitch over publication.  Now I 
have recovered  my  accustomed good humour.

During this time  of  tribulation  I carefully perused your 
Heraclitus.' Your reconstruction  of the  system from  the  scattered 
fragments  I regard  as brilliant,  nor  was I any  less impressed  by the 
perspicacity  of your polemic.  In so far as I  have  any  fault  to find, 
it is largely formal.  I believe your exposé could have been rather 
more condensed without  in any way  jeopardising  the  import.  I 
should, moreover, have liked  to  find  in the  text proper some 
critical indications  as to  your attitude  to Hegelian dialectic. This 
dialectic  is, to be  sure,  the  ultimate word  in philosophy  and  hence 
there  is all the  more need  to divest  it of the  mystical aura given  it 
by Hegel. Finally, there  are  some details upon which  I do not 
agree with  you; e.g.  your interpretation  of  Democritus' natural 
philosophy. These, however,  are all  minor points.  I am all the 
more aware  of the  difficulties  you had to  surmount  in this work  in 
that  ABOUT  18 years  ago I  myself attempted  a similar work  on a far 
easier philosopher, Epicurus b—namely  the  portrayal  of a  com­
plete system from fragments,  a system which  I am  convinced,  by 
the by,  was—as with Heraclitus—only implicitly present  in his 
work,  not  consciously  as a  system. Even  in the  case  of philosophers 
who give systematic form  to their work, Spinoza  for  instance,  the 
true inner structure  of the  system  is quite unlike  the  form  in 
which  it was  consciously presented  by  him.  It is  incomprehensible 
to me, by the by, how you  found  the  time  in the  midst  of all  your 
other work  to acquire  so much Greek philology. 
On the  whole  the  present moment  of time  is a  pleasing  one. 
History is clearly about  TO  TAKE AGAIN  A NEW  START,  and the signs of 
dissolution  EVERYWHERE  ARE  DELIGHTFUL  FOR  EVERY MIND  NOT  BENT UPON  THE 
CONSERVATION  OF  THINGS  AS  THEY  ARE.

9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
DEAR  Frederick, 
It took me a week to acclimatise myself again; moreover, the 
abrupt discontinuation of riding did me no good to begin with. 
Not until this very day have I at last begun to feel as fit as I did 
on the day I left Manchester. I am now  IN WORKING  ORDER  and shall at 
once start getting the stuff ready for publication.3 All I wrote last 
week was 2 articles for the Tribune}* The rest of the time I kept 
constantly on the move, since the feeling of heaviness in my head 
and trouble with my bowels made me fear a relapse. 
Ad vocemc Cluss. Before leaving, this young man visited 
Schapper again. When he got back from my house the worthy 
fellow discovered to his dismay that he had brought something 
back with him from Paris, viz. a chancre with all sorts of nasty 
secondary symptoms. He took to his bed and this, he told 
Schapper, was the reason for his withdrawal from the civilised 
world. 
Ad vocem Pélissier. What we jokingly suggested in Manchester, 
namely that Pélissier would promptly enter into relations with the 
Orléans, has now happened IN REAL GOOD EARNEST, and become the 
talk of the town here. 
What do you think of Bonaparte's thirst for confiscation?319 
During my absence a book by Maclaren covering the entire 
history of CURRENCY came out in Londond; to judge by the excerpts 
in The Economist it is FIRST-RATE.6 The book isn't in the library' 
yet—nothing ever turns up there until months after publication. I, 
of course, am bound to read it before writing my treatise. So I 
sent my wife to the PUBLISHER8 in the City. To our dismay, however, 
we discovered that it costs 9/6d—more than the whole of our

fighting funds. Hence  I should  be most grateful  if you  could send 
me a  POST OFFICE ORDER  for that amount. There probably won't be 
anything that's  new to me in the  book,  but  after  all the  fuss  The 
Economist  has  made about  it and the  excerpts  I myself have read, 
my theoretical scruples won't permit  me to  proceed without having 
looked  at it. 
Don't  you  think  you  might have sufficient material  to do 
something general on the  STATE OF  THE  BRITISH FORCES  IN INDIA  and also 
something conjectural for Friday? IT  WOULD  BE A GREAT BOON  FOR ME 
since reading over  my own  manuscript3 will take  me the  better 
part of a  week.  The  damnable part  of it is  that  my  manuscript 
(which  in  print would amount  to a  hefty volume)  is a  real 
hotchpotch, much  of it  intended  for  much later sections.  So I  shall 
have  to make  an  index briefly indicating  in which notebook  and 
on which page  to find  the  stuff  I want  to work  on  first. 
I have  at long last written  to  Lassalle. b You  must grant  me 
absolution  for the  plaudits  I was  obliged  to accord Heraclitus,  the 
Dark Philosopher.  In a few  unobtrusive asides—for praise  is taken 
seriously only when offset  by  censure—I have  to some extent,  if 
very piano-piano, hinted  at the  real shortcomings  of the  entreprise. 
Tomorrow  or the day  after  I shall  be getting some more Bangya 
numbers/  2 of  which  I shall send  to Manchester,  1 for you and 1 
for Lupus. Apropos,  in an  issue  of the  Tribune  I see  that Pulszky 
is endeavouring  to forestall  the  nauseous  REVELATIONS  by represent­
ing Bangya  as Metternich's  spy and as one who  betrayed General 
Stein.d So statesman Blind,  WHILE GIVING  A TESTIMONIUM PAUPERTATIS  TO 
KOSSUTH,  THE  ILLUSTRIOUS GOVERNOR  OF  HUNGARY-,  in the Adver­
tiser, nevertheless found himself obliged  to invite  him in so  many 
words  to make  a 'counter-statement'. Kossuth,  OF COURSE,  held  his 
tongue. 
How  is Gumpert progressing  in the  noble  art of  equitation?  As 
for me, the  pity  of it is  that  I always have  to break  off  just when 
I'm again making enough progress  to take  an interest  in the  thing.

MARX  TO  ENGELS 20 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  7 June  1858 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Enclosed  2 Bangya numbers, 3 ONE FOR  YOU,  THE  OTHER  FOR  Lupus. 
Have received from you 1. letter with the  POST  OFFICE  NOTE; 
2. SECOND LETTER;  3. ARTICLE FOR THE TRIBUNE (VERY AMUSING ONE. TOO  ). Did 
not acknowledge receipt before because each  day  1 was  expecting  the 
2 Bangya numbers; also  a lot of  PRIVATE TROUBLES  which took  up my 
time. 
Enclosed  a letter from Lassalle.c  It's an  extremely  odd  business. 
I cannot reply until  I have your  own and  Lupus' opinion.  So I 
should like  you  to consult together  at once  and  send  me  your avis à 
without delay.  My  own  view  is that Lassalle should  not  engage  in a 
duel with that  ass  Fabrice  and  that, even from  the  standpoint  of 
the duel,  the  assault  by the two  gentlemen from  the  'High Court' 
has put any duelling  OUT OF THE QUESTION. GENERALLY,  it is my view— 
though having  to decide whether  or not the  duel  as such accords 
with principle seems  to me  ludicrous,  OF COURSE—that  in the  PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES,  AT  THIS  PARTICULAR JUNCTURE,  etc., etc., in contemporary 
history, members  of the  revolutionary party  may  respond  to their 
PRIVATE ENEMIES  with clubs, kicks  and  punches,  but not  engage  in 
duels.  But it  would seem  to me  totally wrong  if, after  he has  come 
out so categorically against all duelling, Lassalle  WOULD  ALLOW  HIMSELF 
TO BE  BULLIED  by feudal  GOSSIP. 
Schapper came  to see me  yesterday. Told  me,  inter alia, that 
friend Caussidière, arriving drunk  in a  disreputable alley  in New 
York  one  evening, apparently attacked  a wench with  his  stick;  her 
yells attracted half  a dozen  LOAFERS  who  promptly  set  upon 
Caussidière  and  beat  him  almost  to  death.  The fat  lout  was 
PICKED  UP unconscious  by the  police early next morning  and it 
was 6 weeks before  he was fit  enough  to be up and  about 
again.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 9 June 1858 
Dear Moor, 
I return Lassalle's letter herewith.3  Borchardt had already told 
me on Saturday with a look of triumph that our little Jew Braun 
had been in a brawl. It's extremely useful to know these details. As 
for our opinion, it's as clear as day that, by making so despicable 
an attempt on a person's life, both the gentlemen, the Intendantur­
rat no less than the Assessor, have adopted in toto the standpoint of 
the bludgeon, and that the only duel one might engage in with 
such laddies has already taken place during the brawl  itself.  If 2 
chaps waylay a third and both of them set on him, I don't believe 
that any duelling code in the world would permit a subsequent 
duel with such  riff-raff.  If Mr Fabrice intended forcibly to 
provoke a duel by means of the horse-whip affair, either Mr Bor 
mann ought to have looked on purely passively as a witness, or 
his presence was altogether superfluous. But when two men 
simultaneously set upon one, then we are dealing with canaille h for 
whom honour and FAIR  PLAY  do not exist and who have given proof 
that  A FAIR  DUEL  cannot be fought with them. Indeed one would run 
the risk of being treacherously murdered. 
So much for my own and Lupus' opinion, if we are to take the 
duelling code as the basis in law.

This apart we share your view that 1. duels are, on the whole, 
untimely for revolutionaries just now and 2. that Lassalle, having 
declared himself unequivocally against duelling 'on principle', 
would be greatly discredited were he now to engage in a duel. 
So far as we are concerned, therefore, you can safely go ahead 
and tell our Ephraim Artful 3 not to fight but rather tranquilly 
restore his 'unshakable determination' with the help of the botde, 
take the moon by the horns again as soon as may be and risk 
annihilation for the hundred and first time. As to the discovery 
that he appears to possess an adequate store of vanity, silence is, I 
think, the best form of congratulation. 
Did you read the story about Fould's sonb ? He decamped to 
London with Mademoiselle Valérie' of the Gymnase and 1,600,000 
francs. His old man d wrote to Pélissier and told him that he 
should au cas de besoin, user d'autorité. e Pélissier invited the loving 
couple to déjeuner 1 and told them: Je vous donne ma bénédiction* and 
wrote to the old man: Que voulez-vous? Les jeunes gens seront toujours 
de jeunes gens! h Whereat old Fould became the laughing-stock of 
Paris.

but because très faciunt collegium 3—to put the CASE to Engels and 
Lupus in Manchester and obtain their opinion. Since their views 
and my own coincide at every point, you may regard the following 
as our  unanimous  OPINION. 
1. From the standpoint of the duel. It is as clear as day that by their 
despicable attack in the street the two gentlemen, the Intendantur­
rat and the Assessor, have adopted in toto the standpoint of the 
bludgeon and that the only duel which one might engage in with 
such laddies has already taken place during the brawl  itself.  If 2 
chaps waylay a third and both of them set on him, we don't believe 
that any duelling code in the world would permit a subsequent 
duel with such  riff-raff.  If, by flourishing a horse-whip, Mr 
Fabrice intended forcibly to provoke a duel, either Mr Bormann 
ought to have looked on purely passively as a witness, or his 
presence was altogether superfluous. But when two men simul­
taneously set upon one, and one of them actually operates  IN THE 
REAR of the person attacked, then we are dealing with canaille b who 
have given proof that  A FAIR DUEL cannot be fought with them. 
2. Principle of the duel. We don't believe that, generally speaking, 
an affair as relative as a duel can be subsumed under the category 
good or bad. That duelling as such is not rational there can be no 
doubt. Nor that it is a relic of a bygone stage of civilisation. 
However, a concomitant of the one-sidedness of bourgeois society is 
that, in opposition to the latter, certain feudal forms maintain the 
rights of the individual. The most striking proof of this is to be 
found in the United States where duelling is a civil right. 
Individuals may become locked in a mutual conflict so insupporta­
ble that a duel seems to them the only solution. However such 
deadly tension is not  IN FACT  possible vis-à-vis an indifferent person 
such as an Intendanturrat, an Assessor, or a lieutenant. This would 
demand a significant personal relationship. Otherwise a duel is an 
utter farce. It is invariably a farce when performed in deference to 
so-called 'public opinion'. 
3. We therefore regard duelling as being purely dependent on 
circumstances; hence recourse may be had to it as an exceptional 
pis aller" in exceptional circumstances. In the  CASE  under discus­
sion, however, all the circumstances argue quite emphatically 
against it, even if the attack in the street had not put it ALTOGETHER 
OUT OF THE QUESTION. 
4. The really decisive factor is that you are not only opposed to 
all duelling on principle but have proclaimed this principle, and in 
a three constitute a panel - b rabble - c evnedient 

=====第357页=====
173. Marx to Engels. 2 July 1858 323 
Fabrice's presence at that. So you would discredit yourself were 
you nevertheless to engage in a duel through fear of 'public 
opinion'. 
5. In the case under discussion, a duel would have absolutely no 
meaning save as the observance of a conventional formality 
recognised by certain privileged classes. Our party must resolutely 
set its face against these class ceremonies and reject with the most 
cynical contempt the presumptuous demand that we submit to 
them. The present state of affairs is far too serious to permit of 
your consenting to such puerilities and it would be sheer puerility 
to engage in a duel with Mr Fabrice because he is an 
'Intendanturrat' and belongs to the clique qualified to fight duels, 
whereas if e.g. a tailor or cobbler were to set about you in the 
street, you would simply hand him over to the courts without any 
infringement of 'honour'. In the case under consideration you 
would not be fighting a duel with Fabrice, an individual who is 
indifferent to you, but with the 'Intendanturrat' —which would be 
an absurd manoeuvre. In general, the fellows' insistence that 
differences with them must be settled by a duel as a privilege due 
to them—and all FASHIONABLE duels fall under this head—should be 
laughed to scorn. To acknowledge this claim would be altogether 
counter-revolutionary. 
I have given you our view in nuce.* We shall be interested to 
hear how the affair progresses. 
Salut. Your

suffering from HOOPING-COUGH, a most alarming illness, besides which 
my wife is very seedy. So my work has been damnably disrupted 
by this and all kinds of other domestic upsets. 
You will remember that, while our friend Schramm was in 
Jersey, I secured him the position of correspondent to an 
American paper. Now that he's dead and after he had dunned 
them on several occasions, his fee of  SOME  6 POUNDS  has arrived and 
has, of course, fallen to Mr  Rudolf 3 as pocket-money. 
Otherwise nothing new here. That little London German rag 
once run by Gumpert has, I believe, now fallen to 'united 
democracy', sub auspiciish  of the great Blind under the title Neue 
Welt. c 
I assume you have read the statements made in the Star by Mr 
Türr and by the Hungarian émigrés in Constantinople. If not, I 
shall send you The Free Press* Meanwhile Kossuth still remains 
obdurately silent. Our excerpt from Bangya's story has appeared 
in the Tribune? The row in New York will force Kossuth to speak. 
Thus I may have to come right out into the open in this matter. 
Pulszky had de longue main 1 provided a loophole in the Tribune 
when he described Bangya as a former spy of Metternich's (!).g 
Klapka, whom I met for a moment or two at Freiligrath's, 
remarked drily of Bangya: 'Finis coronal  opus.'* 1 He seems to be 
very blasé about Kossuth. Is presently dabbling in Turkish shares. 
Herewith two letters from New York.321 
I have had no word from Ephraim Artful 1 for a fortnight. 
Being convinced, OF COURSE, that there was small likelihood of my 
letter being put to discreet use by him, I worded it with the utmost 
caution so THAT IT WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO  ABUSE  IT. Apart 
from the special CIRCUMSTANCES of the CASE, concerning which I gave 
him your opinion pretty well verbatim, I censured duelling only in 
so far as it is claimed as privilege of caste by fellows who believe 
that their insults must be punished otherwise than those of a tailor, 
cobbler, etc. The revolutionary thing to do, I told him, when 
confronted with such inane presumption and laddies of this ilk, 
was to adopt the 'standpoint of the lout' and the 'code of the 
bludgeon'. On the other hand, in reply to Ephraim's pedantry, I 
said that duelling was among the things Aristotle described as 
being 'indifferent' and which one could either take or leave as one

hope that your little Tussye is better. Gumpert tells me that in the 
English climate whooping-cough is seldom dangerous and, though 
usually chronic, is benign. All the cases they've had in the hospital 
so far have ended well. He gave me both the reports (Marei's) this

I had had material of this kind when I was writing my book.3 I 
also have copies of it for you which I shall be sending; individual 
bits may come in useful for your chapter on wage labour. No 
doubt you will derive some amusement from Marei's grandiose 
conception and sanguine expectations. 
Have neither seen nor heard of the statements by Mr Türr, etc. 
The Star is not much read up here. So I'd be glad if you would 
just send The Free Press h and also, if possible, a copy for Lupus, 
who is still in Buxton, whither he was sent by Borchardt, and 
where, out of boredom, he may well do more walking than is good 
for his leg. 
The two letters from New York which you mention in your last 
were not enclosed.321 
Apropos. Kindly let me have Hegel's Philosophy of Nature0 as 
promised. I am presently doing a little physiology which I shall 
combine with comparative anatomy. Here one comes upon highly 
speculative things, all of which, however, have only recently been 
discovered; I am exceedingly curious to see whether the old man 
may not already have had some inkling of them. This much is 
certain: were he today to write a Philosophy of Nature, subjects 
would come flocking in on him from all directions. One has no 
idea, by the way, of the progress made in the natural sciences 
during the past, 30 years. Two things have been crucial where 
physiology is concerned: 1. the tremendous development of 
organic chemistry, 2. the microscope, which has been properly 
used only during the past 20 years. This last has produced even 
more important results than chemistry; what has been chiefly 
responsible for revolutionising the whole of physiology and has 
alone made comparative physiology possible is the discovery of the 
cell—in plants by Schleiden and in animals by Schwann (about 
1836).  Everything consists of cells. The cell is Hegelian 'being in 
itself and its development follows the Hegelian process step by 
step right up  . to the final emergence of the 'idea'—i.e. each 
completed organism. 
Another result that would have delighted old Hegel is the 
correlation of forces in physics, or the law whereby mechanical 
motion, i.e. mechanical force (e.g. through friction), is, in given 
conditions, converted into heat, heat into light, light into chemical 
affinity, chemical affinity (e.g. in the voltaic pile) into electricity, 
the latter into magnetism. These transitions may also take place

d'Orient', The Free  Press,  No. 18, 30 June 1858. - c G. W. F. Hegel, Vorlesungen  über  die 
Naturphilosophie... 

=====第361页=====
174. Engels to Marx. 14 July 1858 327 
differently, backwards or forwards. An Englishmana whose name I 
can't recall has now shown that these forces pass from one to the 
other in quite specific quantitative proportions so that e.g. a 
certain quantity of one, e.g. electricity, corresponds to a certain 
quantity of each of the others, e.g. magnetism, light, heat, 
chemical affinity (positive or negative—combining or separating) 
and motion. The idiotic theory of latent heat is thus disposed of. 
But isn't this splendid material proof of how the reflex categories 
dissolve one into the other? 
This much is certain—comparative physiology gives one a 
healthy contempt for man's idealistic arrogance in regard to other 
animals. At every step it is forcibly brought home to one how 
completely his structure corresponds to that of other mammals; he 
has basic features in common with all vertebrates and even — if less 
distinctly—with insects, crustaceans, tapeworms, etc. Here too 
Hegel's stuff about the qualitative leap in the quantitative sequence 
fits in very nicely. Finally, with the most primitive infusoria, one 
reaches the original form, the single cell existing independently, 
which again is not perceptibly distinguishable from the lowest 
vegetable life (single-celled fungi such as those causing disease in 
potatoes, the vine, etc., etc.) or, at a higher stage of development, 
from the germ right up to and including the human ovum and 
spermatozoon, and is identical in appearance to the separate cells 
in the living body (blood corpuscles, the cells of the epidermis and 
mucous membrane, secreting cells in the glands, kidneys, etc., 
etc.). 
Some time,you might also let me know what sort of a disease 
dyspepsia crapulosab is. This isn't, as it happens, a bad joke but a 
scientifically recognised term. 
If The Times has any particulars about India tomorrow, we shall 
see what can be done for the Tribune, otherwise it will be no go. So 
you'll see from tomorrow's Times more or less what can be 
expected. 
Warm regards to the FAMILY.

MARX TO ENGELS 82 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 15 July 1858 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park 
Dear Engels, 
D'abord3  I would beg you not to take fright at the contents of 
this letter since it is not in any way intended as an  APPEAL-to  your 
already unduly overloaded exchequer. On the other hand it 
behoves us to put our heads together to see if some way cannot be 
found out of the present situation, for it has become absolutely 
untenable. It has already resulted in my being  COMPLETELY  DISABLED 
from doing any work, partly because I have to waste most of my 
time running round in fruitless attempts to raise money, and 
partly because my abstract thinking—due rather, perhaps, to my 
being physically run down—is no longer a match for domestic 
miseries. The general unpleasantness has made a nervous wreck of 
my wife, and Dr Allen who, of course, suspects where the shoe 
PINCHES  but doesn't know the real state of affairs, has now told me 
repeatedly and positively that he cannot rule out brain fever or 
something of the sort unless she is sent to a seaside resort for a 
longish stay. I for my part know that circumstances being what 
they are, this course, even if feasible, would do her no good so 
long as she continues to be the victim of daily pressures and 
haunted by the spectre of final and unavoidable catastrophe. This 
last, however, cannot be long postponed and, even if it be staved 
off for a few weeks, there still remains the unbearable day-to-day 
struggle for MERE  NECESSARIES  and a general situation such as will 
inevitably bring everything to wrack and ruin. 
There are in London so-called  LOAN-SOCIETIES  182 which advertise 
LOANS  of £5-200, without  SECURITIES  and on the strength of REFERENCES 
alone. I therefore attempted an operation of this kind, Freiligrath 
and an épicier h having offered to act as  REFEREES.  The result was that 
some £2 went on  FEES.  The final, negative, answer arrived the 
day before yesterday. I don't know whether I should make a 
further attempt of this kind. 
To give you an idea of the real state of affairs, I have asked my 
wife to draw up a statement in respect of the £20 advanced by you 
a First - b grocer 

=====第363页=====
175. Marx to Engels. 15 July 1858 329 
and the £24 I drew on the Tribune (of which £2 were overdrawn) 
on 16 June. From it you will see that, as soon as a fairly substantial 
sum such as this arrives, not a penny is left over even for the most 
urgent day-to-day expenses, let alone enjoyment of any kind; that 
exactly the same sickening  STRUGGLE  recommences the following day, 
and within a very short time the creditors, having received only 
the most meagre payments on account, once more begin to exert 
exactly the same pressure in respect of other bills which have 
accumulated in the meantime. At the same time you will see that 
my wife hasn't spent a FARTHING on clothes, etc., for  herself,  while 
the situation as regards the children's summer DRESSES is sub-
proletarian. I think it is essential that you should go through these 
particulars since it would not otherwise be possible to arrive at a 
correct opinion of the  CASE. 
Statement in  respect  of £20 received 19 May. Paid out: 
Rates (water, gas) £7 — 
Pawnshop, interest 3 —

Thus,  after 17 June there was again not a single penny in the 
house and, to cover for four weeks day-to-day expenses which had 
to be paid in cash, we borrowed £4 from Schapper, about £2 of 
which, however, went on the abortive LOAN OPERATION IN FEES. 
The full state of indebtedness, as it now stands in London, is as 
follows. (It will show you that a large part of the same consists in 
debts to small épiciers who have stretched their credit as far as it 
will go.) 
Rates, due 25 June £9 — 
School, due 2 August 6 — 
Newspaperman (for a year) 6 — 
TALLYMAN 3 9 
Butcher 7 14 
Baker 6 — 
Epicier  4 — 
GREENGROCER  and  coal  2 — 
Milkman G 17 
Owing to previous milkman and baker in Soho 9 — 
Dr Allen (£7 paid out of last but one Tribune money) 10 — 
Lina Schaler  9 — 
Schapper 4 — 
Pawnshop 30 — 
Of these debts, the only ones I don't consider urgent are those 
owing to Dr Allen, Lina Schöler, the old creditors in Soho and 
part of what is due to the pawnshop. 
Thus the whole business turns on the fact that what little comes 
in is never earmarked for the coming month, nor is it ever more 
than just sufficient—after deducting regular outgoings on house, 
school, rates and pawnshop—to reduce debts to a level that will 
preclude one's actually being thrown out into the street. In some 
4-5 weeks' time I shall have  ABOUT  £24 to draw on the Tribune. Of 
this £15 will immediately go on rates and rent alone. If only a 
minimum is paid out in respect of other debts—and it is very 
questionable whether the BUTCHER, etc., will be prepared to wait so 
long—the predicament will, on the other hand, again be

LIFE-INSURANCE SOCIETY. Even were I to seek to reduce expenditure 
to the utmost—e.g. take the children away from school, move into 
a wholly working-class lodging, get rid of the maids, live on 
potatoes—not even the auction of my household goods would 
suffice to satisfy the creditors in the vicinity and ensure an 
unhampered removal to some hidey-hole. The SHOW of RESPECTABILITY 
which has so far been kept up has been the only means of 
avoiding a collapse. I for my part wouldn't care a damn about 
living in Whitechapel,322 provided I could again at last secure an 
hour's peace in which to attend to my work. But in view of my 
wife's condition just now such a metamorphosis might entail 
dangerous consequences, and it could hardly be suitable for 
growing girls. 
I HAVE  NOW  MADE  A CLEAN  BREAST  OF IT and I assure you that it has cost 
me no small effort to do so. But enfin, 1 I must speak my mind to 
somebody. I know that you yourself can do nothing to help. All I 
ask is your opinion on WHAT TO DO. I would not wish my worst 
enemy to have to wade through the QUAGMIRE in which I've been 
trapped for the past two months, fuming the while over the 
innumerable vexations that are ruining my intellect and destroying 
my capacity for work.

reckoning then, about £50 à £60 is urgent, and the rest can wait a 
while. I could at once raise £30 towards this amount by means of 
a fresh acceptance, provided the fellow agrees to make out the 
acceptance at 4 months minimum, otherwise I wouldn't be in a 
position to find the money. If he is willing it might also be possible 
to draw £20 at 4 months and another £20 at 6 months (plus 
interest) so that I should have to pay in November and January 
and you would at once get £40 clear. So go and see Freiligrath 
straight away and find out what can be done. It is, of course, 
absolutely essential that the discounter retains the acceptances in his 
own portfolio, otherwise I shall be  ruined.  The rascal ought not to ask 
more than the 20% I am calculating on, which already represents 
a loss of nearly £5. 
In this way, or so it seems to me, you would be covered to the 
extent that you could, at a pinch, wait until it's time to draw your 
next bill. But in view of your wife's state of health even more will 
be needed, of course, and unfortunately I can't manage it. I can't 
even step across to Watts here in connection with his Provident 
Institution as I've fallen out with the fellow. However he only has 
a BRANCH-OFFICE up here; the head-oFFicE is in London and you can 
look it up in any DIRECTORY. The business is called the PEOPLES 
PROVIDENT ASSURANCE SOCIETY AND LIFE AND EQUITABLE INSTITUTION 
Freiligrath will easily get hold of a prospectus, TERMS, etc., for you 
and if there is anything to be done, which I doubt, he could also 
set the matter in train. 
Though I've racked my brains I can think of no other method 
of raising money in England. It seems to me that the moment has 
come for you to have a go at your matera or one or other of the 
Dutchmen.b Ultimately it is a question of wiping the slate clean 
and making A FRESH START; all this business of LOANS merely puts 
matters off and ultimately leads to an even worse crisis, quite apart 
from all the money—what with FEES, etc.—and time that is 
expended in attempts to raise the cash. Moreover, an acceptance 
on my part anticipates the money which I would otherwise have 
been able to send you over a period in small amounts and, 
although a lump sum is worth more to you than the ODD 
five-pound note now and again, this will certainly mean a 
corresponding loss of regular income. 
You must really cast aside any reservations— s'il y en aurait c—in 
this case and attempt a coup. It's a question of finding a further

Dear Engels, 
When your letter arrived on Saturday I did not reply 
immediately because I first wanted to see what response I got to 
another 'ATTEMPT' before taking advantage of the authorisation you 
gave me. On Monday, however, I received an answer in the 
negative. Hence any further delay seemed impracticable. Accord­
ingly to Freiligrath. Today he informed me in writing that the 
thing could be proceeded with on the  TERMS  you proposed, but not 
until 3 August since his  USURER  was unable to go ahead any earlier. 
I shall therefore write and tell him to put the business in hand by 
3 August. 
On Saturday I had a long letter from my mother. For I had 
asked Mrs Liebknecht, who was going to Germany, to take the old

From  the  enclosed letter  of Freiligrath  you  will see  that further 
DIFFICULTIES  have arisen.  But the 'new'  terms seem  to me au fond 3 
better than  the old, for  though payment  is nominally required  in 3

Kindly reply at once  ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.  The matter is  PRESSING.  If 
it can be  arranged  in this  way I  shall,  AT ANY RISK,  immediately send 
my wife  to a  nearby seaside resort  for a  couple  of weeks  and, in

Dear Engels, 
If I haven't written before, this was because it wasn't till 
yesterday that the matter was decided for certain and, indeed, in 
the affirmative. Every time I sat down to write to you, another 
letter arrived from the City to say there was nothing doing and 
that I should try and carry out the transaction with  SOMEBODY  ELSE. 
However, I wanted to tell you something definite  ONE  WAY  OR THE 
OTHER. After he had negotiated with 6 different USURERS, and every 
time the fellows went back on their promise when it came to the 
point, Freiligrath eventually discounted the bill with his own tailor, 
after he had agreed to act as collateral. He had, ab initio, 3 made it 
payable at his own bank. The old chap went to a great deal of 
trouble over the matter, even to the extent of taking certain steps 
not altogether in keeping with his 'professional' status. So if you 
should happen to write to him, give him a little  PAT on the back, an 
action to which he is not wholly impervious. The bill has been 
deposited with Freiligrath  himself.  The tailor declares that he is 
prepared to renew it, whatever the circumstances. But he would 
prefer to receive £20 in November so that he would only have to 
make out a new bill for the remaining £20 payable in January. 
(After receiving your letter,327 I immediately informed Freiligrath 
that the thing could not be proceeded with unless there was a 
certainty of renewal.) 
To my alarm I saw from your letter that you were ill again, and 
in the circumstances it was all the more embarrassing to me to 
have  ANNOYED  you. Please write by return saying how you are, or else 
get Dr Gumpert to write. 
After receiving the money, I promptly paid off as much as 
possible and yesterday sent my wife to Ramsgate, since there was 
not another day to be lost. She really is extraordinarily unwell. If 
Ramsgate isn't too expensive, and she is thus able to have several 
weeks of sea bathing, I believe all will soon be RIGHT again.

MEANWHILE I shall see if there's anything to be done with my 
mother. How I should answer the old girl in regard to my 
relations with Prussia is a very ticklish point. It's just possible that 
she might fork out if she thought my inheritance was under threat 
from the authorities. But again it's just possible—since she seems to 
me to be making her will—that she might in that case put 
everything in the care of the Dutchman,3  which wouldn't suit me at 
all. Que faire dans cette situation?* 1 She writes saying her days are 
numbered, but I believe that's just a manner of speaking. She 
probably wanted me to invite her to London, as indeed I would 
certainly have done had my time not been precious to me just now. 
For the past 2 months I have hardly been able to work, and the 
Duncker business is becoming urgent. c 
I have written a lot for the Tribune of late so as to replenish my 
account a bit, but I'm getting damnably short of material. India 
isn't my department. Cherbourg328 would have provided me with 
ample opportunity for political epigrams, except that I'm too 
ignorant of military matters to give the thing the proper depth. 
To me—though it's an altogether subjective opinion, not to say a 
prejudice—Cherbourg would seem to be no more than a DODGE, 
like all Boustrapa's40  grand doings, a mere SLEIGHT  OF HAND.  At any 
rate,  the Moniteur, no less, contained certain ominous hints to the 
effect that the military authorities are by no means happy about 
the choice of the spot and have raised a host of circumstantial 
objections to the lay-out of the works. It is, furthermore,  FAR  FROM 
BEING  FINISHED  and, in its present state, represents rather what's to be 
than what is. The only thing that is completely finished is the big 
equestrian statue of Napoleon. In Central India, or so it seems to 
me, the fall of Gwalior settles the matter. The Indian papers are 
all very hostile to Campbell and critical of his 'tactics'. 
Enclosed a letter from Lassalle. d Ephraim Artful is a curious

running through the man's letters. 'Then I addressed, etc., a

disagreeable, if not serious, consequences later on. He was in

I know nothing about the Cyclopaedia save that I've seen an 
advertisement for the second volume in the Tribune.3 So it's still 
coming out and, if you have the leisure, you might occasionally do 
something for C.—subject, however, to two reservations: 1. I 
cannot go to the Museumb just now; 2. it would be of more 
immediate advantage to me to increase my balance at the Tribune. 
This has already decreased slightly since my wife went away and I 
cannot in any case write twice for them  myself,  as it's impossible 
for me to deal with subjects such as India, Montenegro, China, 
Bonaparte's military railway system and his installations at 
Cherbourg.328 Hence, as soon as time permits (and, OF COURSE, 
without physical  HARM  to yourself), I would greatly prefer it if, in 
the immediate future, you were to write more often for the 
Tribune,  ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER. 
The sea is doing my wife a lot of good; at the beginning of this 
week she sent for all the children and Lenchen.c  So FAR  so GOOD;  the 
only snag is that, UNDER  THE  CIRCUMSTANCES,  I shall hardly be able to let 
her stay there beyond next week. Mentally she is very much 
refreshed, but physically (save that her nerves are stronger) she is 
not yet all that she might be. In Ramsgate she has made the 
acquaintance of refined and, horribile dictu, d clever Englishwomen. 
After years during which she has enjoyed only inferior company, 
if any at all, intercourse with people of her own kind seems to 
agree with her. 
Have you read the review in The Times of Gladstone's book on

DEAR  Frederick, 
You must exercise your customary forbearance and excuse my 
long silence. The indisposition from which I was suffering even 
before leaving Manchester again became chronic—persisting 
throughout the entire summer—so that any kind of writing costs 
me a tremendous effort. For the same reason my manuscriptb is 
only now about to go off (IN 2 WEEKS), but there will be 2 instalments 
AT ONCE.  Even though I had nothing to do but correct the style of 
what had already been written, I might sometimes sit for hours 
before getting this or that phrase right. For  ABOUT  8 DAYS, by the by, 
I have been much better and on the whole I find the cooler time 
of year more beneficial. Moreover, there is every prospect that, 
with my mother's help, I shall be able to put my domestic affairs 
entirely in order and also start to take HORSE EXERCISE again. The 
latter will be my prime concern, as soon as the  BUSINESS  has been 
attended to. 
Meanwhile I have been writing very regularly for the Tribune, as 
1 have no desire to make these chaps a gift of any money. 
Find out from Lupus or (direcdy or indirecdy) from Borchardt 
whether they know a Mrs von Paula (might sign herself Paulaw) 
who once lived in Breslau. 13 If so, I have something curious to tell 
you.

Re Bangya,  I had in my  possession  (but,  alas, only  for a few

as well  as cuttings from  the  Constantinople papers.  The  excerpts

appear  to be  directly compromised.  I have  now  SUMMONED  him in

Apropos.  I've had an  amusing experience with  the  Tribune.  By 
way of evaluating the  'REPORT  of the  COMMITTEE"1  on the late crisis I 
sent the  paper several articles specifically relating  to  banking, 
CURRENCY,  etc.,  which they published  as  LEADERS.*31  Along comes  a 
BANKER,  a self-styled  'BULLIONIST',  and writes a letter to the Tribune" in 
which he says 1. that never has so  COMPREHENSIVE  A SUMMARY  of the 
whole subject been  PENNED,  etc.,  but 2.  raises  all kinds  of objections 
and challenges  the  editors  to reply.  So  reply  the  POOR DEVILS  must 
needs dof and  INDEED VERY  SAD  WORK  they made of it. But such 
incidents  can  only  do me  good. 
Our friend Jones  HAS DECIDEDLY SOLD HIMSELF (BUT  AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE 
PRICE)  TO THE  BRIGHT COTERIE.  The idiot has ruined himself politically 
without rescuing himself commercially.  I'll cut out the  articles 
relating  to him in  Reynolds's  and  send them  to you.  But how  litde 
his apostasy—the laddie is preaching  UNION  OF THE  MIDDLE AND WORKING 
CLASSES—has  availed  him (he has  sold  The  People's Paper  to the 
Morning Star fellows,  has  retained  a mere couple  of columns  in 
the sheet  for  himself  and is,  moreover, already  at loggerheads with 
his new  allies over  the  financial terms) will  be evident  to you  from 
the fact that  the day  before yesterday  he  went  to Freiligrath  and 
handed  him a  letter  in German  in which  he  asked  for £4,  failing 
which  he  would  be  'locked  up'.  Freiligrath told  him to  address 
himself  'TO OUR  FRIEND GILPIN'.  That Gilpin is  MANAGING DIRECTOR  of the 
SWITZERLAND BANK  and of the paper with which Jones has 
incorporated himself.

tomorrow333 ; THE THING IS OUT OF MY LATITUDE ALTOGETHER. I have not 
read the newspapers at all regularly of late and have had a great 
deal to do, since Ermen has been over there for the past fortnight 
and I am having to cope with the whole shop on my own. Business 
here is tremendously good; for the past 6 weeks the spinners have 
been making Id à l'Ad more per pound on coarse and medium 
counts than for the past 3 years and—quite unprecedented 
this—the local market in yarn rose Id before the Liverpool chaps 
were able to get another 'Ad for cotton. During the past 10-12 
days the rise has slowed down somewhat, but all the spinners are 
booked up well ahead and demand is still quite strong enough to 
sustain prices. If it goes on like this much longer there'll be 
MOVEMENTS for increased wages. In France, too, the cotton spinners 
have for sometime been earning more than in recent years (this is 
positive; I have it from a cotton agent who was over there 
himself); how things look in other branches of commerce there I 
can't say exactly, but the state of the Bourse suggests a 
considerable improvement. All this looks damned rosy and the

devil only knows how long it will last unless there is substantial 
overproduction with India and China in view. Trade must be 
absolutely splendid in India just now; the last Bombay MAIL but one 
advised sales—over a 14-day period—of 320,000 pieces of cotton 
cloth, and the last one a further 100,000. The chaps have already 
sold the whole lot forward, knowing only that it had been 
purchased in Manchester and not yet even shipped. Judging by 
the way the local philistines are talking and also by the state of the 
market, it seems to me that India and China will provide an 
immediate excuse for overproduction and, if we have a good 
winter, it may confidently be expected that kite-flying and the 
unbridled granting of credit will again go ahead merrily in the 
spring. 
The Jones business is most distasteful. He held a meeting here 
and the speech he made was entirely in the spirit of the new 
alliance.334 After that affair one might almost believe that the 
English proletarian movement in its old traditional Chartist form 
must perish utterly before it can evolve in a new and viable form. 
And yet it is not possible to foresee what the new form will look 
like. It seems to me, by the way, that there is in fact a connection 
between Jones' NEW MOVE, seen in conjunction with previous more 
or less successful attempts at such an alliance, and the fact that the 
English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, 
so that the ultimate aim of this most bourgeois of all nations would 
appear to be the possession, alongside the bourgeoisie, of a 
bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat. In the case of a 
nation which exploits the entire world this is, of course, justified to 
some extent. Only a couple of thoroughly bad years might help 
here,  but after the discoveries of gold these are no longer so easy 
to engineer. For the rest it is a complete mystery to me how the 
massive overproduction which caused the crisis has been absorbed; 
never before has such heavy flooding drained away so rapidly. 
Reynolds will become a prominent personage thanks to Jones' 
manoeuvre; he is the only 'educated' man (vulgo 'scholar') who still 
poses as the representative of the proletariat— au fond 3 he is as 
bourgeois as Monsieur Jones has now become, though in a 
different way. For him this is a GODSEND. Be sure to send me the 
cuttings from his paper b you promised me. 
There is still something wrong with Lupus' leg; he still can't 
walk fast without suffering for it, though he is walking passably 
well again.

London, Friday, [8 October b] 1858 
DEAR  Frederick, 
You will today be receiving two packages  AT ONCE  since not all the 
stuff could go into one letter. It consists of: 
1. Cuttings from Reynolds's relating to Jones. You will see for 
yourself where Reynolds is conveying FACTS, and opinions based on 
FACTS,  and where he is venting his spleen. Reynolds is a far greater 
rogue than Jones, but he is rich and a good speculator. The mere 
FACT  THAT  HE HAS  TURNED  AN OUT  AND  OUT CHARTIST shows that this position 
must  STILL  be a 'profitable' one. I have read the speech Jones made 
in Manchester. 4 Since you did not see his earlier SPEECHES in 
Greenwich, etc., you couldn't have detected that he is making 
another TURN and seeking again to bring the 'alliance' more into 
accord with his former attitude. 
2. Pyat's new lettre," which contains one or 2 FACTS that are 
INTERESTING, otherwise in his former manner. 329 The marks in the

margin have been scribbled  by my  BABY3  and do not,  therefore, 
have  any  bearing  on the  contents. 
3. Mazzini's  new  manifesto.b  Still  the  same  old  jackass. Save that 
now he is  gracious enough  not to  consider  le salariat 11 any  longer 
as the  absolute  and  final form. There's nothing funnier than  the 
way he  contradicts  himself,  on the one  hand saying that  in Italy 
the revolutionary party  is organised according  to his  views  and, on 
the other, proving after  'his own'  fashion  not  only that  it has the 
nation behind  it, but  also that there  is every outward prospect  of 
success—and finally fails  to explain  why,  despite  Dio e  Popolo AND 
MAZZINI INTO  THE  BARGAIN,  all is calm in Italy. 
4. A little cutting from  the  Cincinnati Hochwächter containing  a 
letter from 'General' Willich. 
Considering  the  optimistic turn taken  by  world trade  AT  THIS 
MOMENT  (although the vast accumulations of money in the  BANKS  of 
London, Paris  and New  York show that things cannot  by any 
means  be  ALL RIGHT  yet),  it is  some consolation  at least that  the 
revolution  has  begun  in  Russia,  for I  regard  the  convocation  of 
'NOTABLES'  to Petersburg335  as such  a beginning. Similarly  in Prussia 
things  are  worse than they were  in 1847, and the  ridiculous 
DELUSIONS  AS TO THE  MIDDLE CLASS PROPENSITIES  OF THE  PRINCE  OF PRUSSIA  will be 
exploded  in an  outburst  of rage.336  It will  do the  French  no  harm 
to see  that, even without them,  the  world 'mov't' (Pennsylvania-
fashion).4  At the  same time exceptional movements  are on  foot 
amongst  the  Slavs, notably  in Bohemia, which, though counter­
revolutionary,  yet  provide ferment  for the  movement.  The 
Russian  war of  1854-55,e  wretched though  it was and  little though 
its consequences damaged  the  Russians  (but  rather  the  Turks), 
nevertheless clearly precipitated  the  present turn  of  events  in 
Russia.  The  only circumstance which turned  the  Germans into 
mere satellites  of France  so far as  their revolutionary movement 
was concerned,  was the  ATTITUDE  of Russia. This absurdity will cease 
with an  internal movement  in  Moscow.  As  soon  as the  thing 
assumes clearer shape there,  we  shall have proof  of the  full extent 
to which  the  worthy Regierungsrat Haxthausen  has allowed 
himself  to be  hoodwinked  by the  'authorities'  and by the  peasants 
those authorities have trained. 337 
There  is no  denying that bourgeois society  has for the  second 
time experienced  its 16th  century,  a 16th  century which,  I hope,

will sound  its death knell just  as the  first ushered  it into  the  world. 
The proper task  of bourgeois society  is the  creation  of the  world 
market,  at least  in outline,  and of the  production based  on  that 
market. Since  the  world  is round,  the  colonisation  of California 
and Australia  and the  opening  up of  China  and  Japan would seem 
to have completed this process.  For us, the  difficult  QUESTION  is this: 
on the  Continent revolution  is imminent  and  will, moreover, 
instantly assume  a socialist character. Will  it not  necessarily  be 
CRUSHED  in this little corner  of the  earth, since  the  MOVEMENT  of 
bourgeois society  is still  in the  ASCENDANT  over  a far  greater area? 
So far as  China  in particular  is concerned,  I have,  by carefully 
analysing  the  movement  of trade since 1836, established first that 
by 1847 the  surge  in English  and  American exports between  1844 
and 1846 had  proved  a complete fraud  and  that,  in the 10  years 
that followed,  the  average remained pretty stationary whereas 
imports from China into England  and  America rose enormously; 
secondly, that  the  only result  of the  opening  up of the 5  ports  38 
and the  annexation  of  Hong Kong  was a  shift  of  trade from 
Canton  to Shanghai.  The  other  'EMPORIUMS'  do not  count.  The  main 
reason  for the  FAILURE  of this market would seem  to be the  opium 
trade—to which, indeed, every increase  in the  export trade  to 
China  has  invariably been confined; however, another factor  is the 
country's internal economic organisation, its  MINUTE AGRICULTURE,  etc., 
to demolish which will take  an  enormously long time. England's 
present  TREATY  with China332 which,  in my  view,  was  worked  out 
by Palmerston jointly with  the  cabinet  in Petersburg  and was  given 
to Lord Elgin  to take with  him on his  journey,  is A MOCKERY FROM 
BEGINNING  TO END. 
Can you  give  me  your sources  for the  PROGRESS  of the  Russians  in 
Central Asia?  I shall  use the  articlea  for The  Free Press,  at any  rate. 
My mother  has  suddenly  and  unexpectedly withdrawn into 
what,  to me, is an  inexplicable silence.  I am  inclined  to think that 
third persons have  put a  spoke  in the  wheel.  But the  matter will 
resolve  itself. 
Regards  to Lupus.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 21 October 1858 
Dear Moor, 
For the past fortnight I've been VERY MUCH PUT OUT  OF THE WAY by 
sundry slings and arrows—a rumpus at my LODGINGS necessitating a 
move and all that entails and, for good measure, a mass of other 
tiresome happenings. I haven't even found new LODGINGS yet and 
am hardly likely to be out of the TROUBLE before the end of next 
week. 
Much obliged for the stuff relating to Jones, Mazzini and Pyat, 
likewise the 'enthusiastic general'.11 The latter seems to have 
surrendered entirely to the vulgar German-American day-dream; 
habeat sibi,b let him go hang.  Quoad c Jones, I should say that 
Reynolds's is a bit short on  FACTS  and presupposes some degree of 
familiarity with preceding events. This turn things have finally 
taken is hardly surprising in view of the contemptible way 
Monsieur Jones has already long been behaving. But simply to 
throw oneself away like that! Duncombe did at least get his debts 
paid and a good position into the bargain. 
Pyat and Mazzini, even by comparison with formerly, are 
distinguishing themselves by a surprising poverty of intelligence. 
Prospects for Mr Rudolf Schramm seem exceedingly poor. Now 
as always, the corporald is confiscating newspapers and, if the 
telegraphic despatches are to be believed, did not even swear an 
oath on the Constitution yesterday. At any rate, the joyous 
day-dream which the Prussian bourgeois have deluded each other 
into believing will very soon evaporate, but I agree with you when 
you say that this won't be the end of the affair.336 However, I'm 
not yet clear as to what course it will take. I should say that the 
bourgeoisie has not yet got over 1848 and 1849 to such an extent 
as to summon up sufficient courage simultaneously to confront on 
the one hand the aristocracy and bureaucracy, and, on the other, 
proletarian unrest. However, it's possible that, so long as nothing 
is going on in France, the proletarian movement will for a time 
seem too slight a threat to be very intimidating; but in that case its

progress will have to be damned slow. If nothing happens in 
France—which, in view of the present state of the Crédit 
mobilier's 43 shares, is hardly to be expected—Prussia might, of 
course, see the formation of a movement similar to the one in 
Italy during the years 1846-48, with a proletarian background. But 
otherwise I'm afraid the bourgeoisie may come round again before 
it's too late. 
The Russian affair is turning out very well.335 There is unrest in 
the South now, too. Apropos. Could you obtain for me from 
Tchorzewsky, or whoever Herzen's agent is now, a few of his more 
recent publications? After all, these ought to contain something, 
e.g. his roRoca U3b Pocciu (Voices from Russia) and the KOROKOJH 
(Bell).  Some material might be found in them, though hardly very 
much—but certainly now and again in the correspondents' 
reports, etc., etc. 
My sources for the Central Asiatic stuff were Brockhaus' new 
volume Unsere Zeit* (partly copied from the Preußisches Wochen­
blatt) and Petermann's geographical Mittheilungen. h The material is 
all derived from Russian state papers. If you like I could write an 
article about the Russian treaty with China339 (what a slap in the 
face for England and France!) for Tuesday, or thereabouts,' i.e. if 
not prevented by my exodus. Let me know, and also send your 
further comments on the connection you suspect exists between 
the Elgin treaty and Pam. Or perhaps you have already dealt with 
this yourself? 
India is now quite outside my LATITUDE. From the military point 
of view nothing at all remains to be said. So desultory has 
everything become that it's not even possible to do a survey of one 
month's events. Altogether, I'm in a quandary about subjects for 
articles to send you. 
What's the position about the manuscript for Dunckere ? Nows 
YOUR TIME. Come what may, there'll be a new ministry which will 
probably be rather more hesitant about making its début with the 
confiscation of a scientific work. I hope it has gone off. But let me 
know for sure, so that I can reassure Lupus too. Last Sunday he 
arrived at my place very much the worse for drink, but was safely 
escorted home. Since then his leg has been rather worse again; no 
doubt it took a knock.

For the past four weeks, trade here has been going through a 
sticky period during which the spinners have had their profits cut 
by '/ad per lb as a result of a fall in yarn and a rise in cotton. 
However, they are still doing good business and, if cotton again 
comes down a bit, as is quite possible, it will take only a minimal 
increase in demand to restore the situation. Moreover, there are 
signs here and there of moves by the workers to obtain higher 
wages and, if business continues good, these will gather force. 
How are things going with your mater? Best regards to your

I've still not begun the article.341 I am just writing you these few

Enclosed you will find works by the great Blind, who now 
functions as a 'united' friend of the people. The £100 has 
also been remitted to him by Kinkel. Keep the  stuff.  You will 
observe that Pyat and Mazzini still stand head and shoulders above 
these German democrats in the matter of style, etc. Blind has also 
set his hand over here to the trade he learnt on the Mannheimer 
Abendzeitung. He gets a couple of acquaintances in Hamburg to 
send to English papers letters (composed by himself) in which 
mention is made of the stir created by his anonymous pam­
phlets." His friends then write more letters, this time to the 
German press, saying what a fuss has been made by the English 
papers, etc. That, you see, is what it is to be a man of action. 
Paid a visit to 'unhappy' Pieper in hospital. Has a syphilitic boil

HENCE IN VERY  BAD  HUMOUR, these having come on top of all my other

Your articlea went off yesterday as of Friday, since I had sent 
nothing on that day. I myself wrote about the new Prussian 
ministry. Have now sent about six articles on Prussia dated Berlin to 
the Tribune^ So I don't imagine that you will be able to have  ANY 
NEW MATTER concerning Prussia for next Tuesday. One subject that 
might be worth writing about, though in this case I fear our 
COMMON MATERIAL  GOES  NOT  VERY  FAR, would be the growth of industry in 
Prussia over the last 10 years. But WHENCE obtain the 'material'? As 
regards Japan I imagine the Yankees know more about it than we 
do, though in fact their knowledge is always exceedingly superfi­
cial. Those engaged in high politics (e.g. Mr Pulszky in the 
Tribune) are blathering away about a possible war in Italy between 
Austria on the one hand and Bonaparte and Piedmont on the 
other. I regard all that as nonsense. Might it not, on the whole, be 
a good idea to say something sensible for once about Bonaparte's

the most severe liver trouble had virtually incapacitated me for 
work. And as for my 'splendid circumstances', Freiligrath and I 
had deemed fit to conjure up the brightest of pictures for the 
benefit of this average German bourgeois, while altogether 
concealing the darker side, since we both opined that even the best 
bourgeois of this type could not fail to derive a certain malicious 
satisfaction from the knowledge of what the fuorusciti's* cir­
cumstances were really like. So  FAR Köster. 
As regards the delay in sending off the manuscript,b I was first 
prevented from doing so by illness, and subsequently had to catch 
up on the other 'bread and butter' work. But the real reason is 
this: the material was to hand and all that I was concerned with was 
the form. But to me the style of everything I wrote seemed tainted 
with liver trouble. And I have a twofold motive for not allowing 
this work to be spoiled on medical grounds: 
1. It is the product of 15 years of research, i.e. the best years of 
my life. 
2. In it an important view of social relations is scientifically 
expounded for the first time. Hence I owe it to the Party that the 
thing shouldn't be disfigured by the kind of heavy, wooden style 
proper to a disordered liver. 
My aim is not to produce an elegant exposé, but only to write as 
I usually do, which, during these months of sickness, was 
impossible—at least on this subject, although over the same period 
I was compelled to write, and hence did write, the equivalent of at 
least 2 printed volumes of English leading articles de omnibus rebus 
et quibusdam aliis. c 
I believe that even if someone less intelligent than you were to 
acquaint Mr Duncker with this state of affairs, he could not but 
sanction a mode of conduct which, so far as he as a publisher was 
concerned, merely signified the endeavour to give him the best 
value for his money. 
I shall have finished about 4 weeks from now, having only just 
begun the actual writing. 
There is a further circumstance which, however, you should not 
put to him until the arrival of the manuscript. The first section, 
'Capital in General', is likely to run to 2 instalment's since I have 
discovered while elaborating it that here, at the very juncture 
where the most abstract aspect of political economy is to be 
discussed, undue brevity would render the thing indigestible to the 
public. But on the other hand this second instalment must come

out at the same time as the first. This is demanded by their intrinsic 
coherence, and the whole effect depends upon it. 
Apropos. In your letter from Frankfurt you said nothing about 
your economic work.278  As far as our rivalry is concerned, I don't 
believe that the German public suffers from an embarras de  richesses 
in this field. IN  FACT  economics as a science in the German sense of 
the word has yet to be tackled and to that end not just the two of 
us but a dozen will be needed. I hope, at any rate, that my work 
will result in drawing a number of better brains into the same field 
of research. 
I should be infinitely obliged to you if you could write to me 
from time to time about conditions in Prussia and send me the 
relevant newspaper clippings. 
My wife sends her regards and says she is afraid Köster is as 
mistaken about 'her beauty' as he is about her husband's health. 
Freiligrath likewise sends his regards. He is completely im­
mersed in his profession of banker. Hence you should not hold his 
silence against him. 
Salut.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 24 November 1858 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Yesterday I wrote about Prussia.11 So for Friday you have all the 
rest of the world at your disposal. 
Have received the £1. The 'particular' pickle in which I find 
myself at the moment arises from the fact that I was compelled to 
pay out all  AT  ONCE  more than £8 to the newspaper man, who had 
a 'Affairs in Prussia'

been giving me credit for over a year. I'm stone broke, which in 
this weather is not COMFORTABLE. In Trier, my sister3 would now 
seem to have frustrated my mother's perfectly rational INTENTIONS, 
or at least to have postponed THEIR REALISATION sine die. 
Blind was here the day before yesterday with wife.b It was over a 
year since I had seen this FAMILY. From them I learnt sundry pieces 
of gossip. 
1. Mrs Kinkel threw herself out of the window a week ago last 
Monday and has since been buried. Gottfried, 0 with a sublimity all 
his own, attended the post-mortem and delivered an 'oration' at 
the graveside. Freiligrath is so moved that he'll shun me, as a 
'frivolous' man, for a fortnight at least. 
2. Fröbel is over here. Has married a rich wife. Is returning to 
America. According to him Russia and America must share the 
world between them, a point of view that makes him feel very 
superior. He enthuses over American 'luxury' and GENTLEMAN-
LIKENESS, despises the Germans and gives practical proof of this by 
engaging in the German slave trade to Central America. It's really 
too comical that, because deeply impressed by bourgeois society in 
its American reality, this son of Rudolstadt should believe himself 
more 'advanced' than the  REST  OF EUROPE-. Once they  HAVE  FOUND  THEIR 
BREAD  AND CHEESE,  all these scoundrels require is some blasé pretext to 
bid farewell to the struggle. 
3. Asinine Ruge, in a piece for Prutz, has proved that 
'Shakespeare was not a dramatic poet' because he 'had no 
philosophical system', whereas Schiller, being a Kantian, is a  TRULY 
'dramatic poet'.d  Prutz then wrote a 'vindication of Shakespeare'." 
In addition, Ruge described Moleschott in the American papers as 
'a silly ass', whereupon Heinzen sacked him from the Pionier. 
However, the old bounder is now finding a place for his inanities 
in Börnstein's Anzeiger des Westens. 
4. The foolish Ewerbeck returned to Paris two years ago, 
corresponds regularly with Blind. Had let himself be inveigled by 
Ribbentrop into marrying Ribbentrop's maid, only to discover that 
the former was tumbling the latter, after which came divorce, 
lawsuit, etc. He was assistant in a Paris library, and was sacked by 
the priests. Writes to say he only has 1,200 frs left, threatens to 
come to England having read in the Univers, etc., that 'socialism 
and atheism' are flourishing in the latter country.

allegedly approached people  in the  street  for a  shilling. 
6. Loutish Landolphe  has  reappeared  in England  as a  beggar 
and through Blind's intervention,  has  been engaged  by Dr

DEAR  Frederick, 
ARTICLE  received.3  VERY GOOD.  Quoadh Bonaparte, I have lately 
dealt with  two  separate points—the  SHAM PROVOCATION  of England  in 
the Portuguese affair 342 and how the  fellow  is GENERALLY  avenging 
Waterloo2  7 only in so far as he can do so by  SHAM DEMONSTRATIONS 
within  the  'limits  of the  English alliance'  and  hence,  IN FACT,  with 
the permission  of the  English government, although  he is, in 
reality, England's underling. Secondly,  his  edict  re the  CORN-
GRANARIES,0  by which this 'socialist' proposes  to remedy  the  ruinously 
LOW PRICES OF  CORN—dangerously  low, in view of the grumbles of the 
PEASANTRY—by  creating  an artificial demand  at the  BAKERS  expense.0 
GENERALLY,  A  VERY DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT THIS,  TO  RAISE  THE  PRICE  OF  CORN 
THROUGH GOVERNMENT UKASES.  Increasing the cost of bread will do more 
harm  to his  popularity  in the  towns than  it can do  good  in the 
country.

I have not written about the  GENERAL RISING  of the bourgeoisie in 
Europe  but did, of  course, allude  to it in  what  I wrote about 
Prussia.  I have dealt with  the  Russian peasant movement  ABOUT 
twice  in 6  months,3  the  second time simply  to show that  on the 
first occasion  my  diagnosis  was  correct. 
As regards  the  reform movement  in  England,  all I  have 
discussed latterly  is Bright's meeting  in Birmingham,b  the  gist of 
the article being  THAT  HIS  PROGRAMME  IS A  REDUCTION  OF  THE  PEOPLES 
CHARTER  TO THE  MIDDLE CLASS STANDARD.344  Earlier on,  ABOUT  8-12  WEEKS 
ago (I think Parliament was actually still sitting),  a piece  to the  effect 
that  WHIGGISM MUST DISSOLVE AND COALESCE WITH TORYISM INTO THE PARTY OF  THE 
ARISTOCRACY.0  That is all. 
My wife  is copying  the  manuscriptd  and it's  hardly likely  to go 
off before  the end of  this month.  The  reasons  for the  delay: long 
intervals  of physical indisposition which, with  the  cold weather,  has 
now come  to an end. Too  much domestic  and  financial  TROUBLE. 
Finally,  the  first section  is now  longer because  the two  initial 
chapters,  of which  the  first,  The  Commodity,  did not  appear  at all in 
the rough draft while  the  second, Money,  or  Simple Circulation,  was 
only sketched  in the  briefest outline, have been written  at greater 
length than  I originally planned.

[London,]  11 December  1858 
Dear Engels, 
Can you let me  have  an account  of Bright's  MEETING  by Tuesday, 
so worded as to make it clear  THAT  THE  WRITER  WAS AT  MANCHESTER? 
Herewith Kinkeliana.345  Freiligrath seems  to think that, because 
the Kinkel woman  has  broken  her  neck,  her  husband  has  become 
a great  man, or at  very least  a noble  one. So  melodramatically  did 
Kinkel organise  the  funeral—with 'trembling hand'  and  'laurel 
wreath', etc.—that Freiligrath,  who  could  not  wring from  his  lyre a 
single note  of sorrow  for the  'tragic' events, either  in his own  party 
(as at Daniels' death)  or in the  world  GENERALLY  (Cayenne, 346 Orsini 
AND so FORTH),  suddenly goes  and  hymns  the  wretched humbug. 
From  The  Daily Telegraph cutting  you  will see how the  coterie  is 
exploiting  the  death  of the  NASTY,  'acrimonious shrew'  (for  such 
was the  affected, speciously clever, essentially coarse personage 
whose meanness  was  GLARINGLY  displayed  in, e.g., her  ingratitude  to 
Strodtmann  and to Mrs von  Brüningk once  she had  squeezed  the 
latter  dry, etc.) in  just  the  same  way as the  creature herself 
exploited  'KINKELS  HAT.  SHOT THROUGH  AND  THROUGH',  and wrote to 
Germany from London: *'Have  you an  idea what  it is to be 
looked upon  as a  sort  of mother  to all  emigrants?' * That  was  what

the creature wrote  at a  time when  she and  Gottfried,  AS A SORT OF 
BEGGAR,  were knocking  at the  doors  of all the  Jews  in the  City. 
And there's something else  I don't like  in the  palliative letter 
Freiligrath wrote  me. I am  expected  to regard  his  opposition  to 
the general craze  for  amnesty,  i.e.,  IN FACT,  to Rudolf Schramm's 
idiosyncrasy,  as something revolutionary.  But a few  weeks  ago our 
Freiligrath  got  himself naturalised English  and  would  be a  fool 
indeed were  he to  yearn nostalgically  for the  post  of a  badly paid 
clerk  in Germany  so  long  as those nice Crédits mobiliers  LAST. 
Very vividly  do I  remember  Mrs  Freiligrath—at  a time when 
people were already drivelling about amnesty  but the  GENERAL BANK 
OF SWITZERLAND  had as yet no place in the  ROYAL EXCHANGE BUILDINGS— 
most earnestly seeking  to persuade  me not to  raise  any  objection 
to the  acceptance  of amnesty. 
All these people sense  THAT THERE  IS SOMETHING MOVING AGAIN.  And, of 
course,  are  pushing their  way  onto  the  stage bearing banners  of 
liberty. 
Keep  the  enclosed poem  and  letter. 
In this house things look  MORE DREARY  AND  DESOLATE THAN EVER.  Since 
my wife cannot even arrange Christmas festivities  for the 
children—instead,  she is  beset  on all  sides  by dunning letters,  on 
top of  which  she is  having  to  copy  my  manuscript3  and, in 
between whiles,  to run  errands  to the  pawnshop  in town—the 
atmosphere  is gloomy  in the  extreme. Moreover,  my  wife  is quite 
right when  she  says thai, after  all the  misère  she has had to go 
through,  the  revolution will only make things worse  and  afford 
her the  gratification  of  seeing  all the  humbugs from here once 
again celebrating their victories over there. Women  are  like that. 
And the  womanish behaviour  of  Freiligrath,  etc., and  other 
acquaintances justly embitters  her. A la  guerre comme  à la  guerre, b 
she says.  But  THERE  IS NO guerre.  It's  day-to-day routine.

DEAR  Frederick, 
£2 received with  THANKS. 
I knew about Blind's confection (just  the  kind  of thing,  as he 
told me  himself,  that Hecker used  to do),  although  I wasn't,  of 
course, aware  of some  of the  nicer details. D'abord," this Telegraph 
Morning Express  is edited  by  several English Seilers,  and all its 
telegraphic despatches,  or at any  rate the  better part  of them,  are 
reprinted from London morning papers.  I can  vouch  for the  FACT 
that Blind smuggled  a bogus  TELEGR. DESPATCH 1 (dated Brussels) into 
The Morning Advertiser. This  was,  OF COURSE,  instantly appropriated 
by the  Telegraph Morning Express. Secondly,  Dr Bronner  is not 
merely  an but the  agent  of Blind,  [he]  having  'no  other'  to send. 
I also believe  it was  he himself  who  'decreed' that  [the  missive]  be 
sent to  Lupus, since Bronner never does anything [without] 
official sanction.  In  today's Daily Telegraph also,  you  will find  in 
the letter from Berlin: *'Similar petitions have been presented  to 
the (Holstein) Diet by the  German merchants resident  at Bradford 
and Liverpool.'*  The  industry  of these little Baden fleas hatched 
in the  democratic midden  is touching. Even  the  Ancients indulged 
in sundry edifying reflections  on the  subject  of flea jumps. 
I've had a  satisfying experience with  the  Tribune.  For  months 
that rotten sheet  had  published  as  LEADERS  all my  articles  on  China 
(a complete history  of Anglo-Chinese trade,b  etc.) and had  even 
been complimented  on  them.  But  when  the  official text  of the 
Anglo-Chinese treaty332  was  finally released,  I wrote  an  article  in 
which  I said inter alia that  the  Chinese 'would  now  legalise  the 
import of opium, likewise put an  IMPORT  DUTY  on opium and,  LASTLY, 
might even permit  the  cultivation  of opium actually  in China',  and 
thus the  SECOND OPIUM WAR'  would  SOONER OR LATER  deal a  DEADLY  BLOW  to 
the English  OPIUM TRADE,  and notably to the  INDIAN EXCHEQUER^ WELL! 
Mr Dana printed this article  as  being from  an  OCCASIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT-  in London, and himself wrote a bombastic  LEADER

Little  by little philistine Freiligrath  is coughing  up  sundry things 
about Gottfried.d  1.  that Gottfried  is sending Gerstenberg  to see 
various  MERCHANTS  in the  City, suggesting they subscribe  to the 
Hermann. After  all,  says  he, the  poor  man has got to  'live'  and 
make  up for the  'loss' incurred through  the  death  of his  wife. 
2. He  tells  me  that Gottfried, immediately after  the  Mockel woman's 
death, approached  him and  asked whether  (and how big) a  deal 
might  be  done with Cotta over  her  literary estate. 'After  all',  says 
Gottfried,  'I enjoy  the  favour  of the  public' 
It could  be that Blind himself  is again hoodwinking  The  Morning

Dear Engels, 
Will you be so good as to send me Lupus' address. 
If you have done with Serbia,350  there is fresh material READY to 
hand in the (proposed) changes in the Landwehr in Prussia, on 
which I shall have to report. 3 Today's Times contains a detailed 
account dated Vienna of the latest brouhaha in Serbia.b 
While Mr Edgar Bauer is editorc  under THE AUSPICES of Scherzer 
and is even adopting 'class contradictions' and giving them a 
Berlin twist, Mr Gottfried Kinkel, who can't afford to let slip the 
opportunity presented by the Kinkel REVIVAL, is bringing out a 
weekly in London, to wit, the Hermann (not the Cheruscan, I 
presume, but Goethe's SIMPLETON). 352 Freiligrath, or so it seems from 
a brief note he sent me, is already REPENTANT of the BLUNDER d  he 
committed. If you write, tell him (but most politely,  OF COURSE,  for he 
complains about the crude, brash tone of your letters) that in 
Manchester there is much talk among the Germans about his 
alliance with Kinkel; you might also slip in Heckscher's anecdote, 
quoting your source. At this particular time it is of moment to us 
that Freiligrath should break with these swine for good. 
Apropos, Willich is now editing the gymnasts' paper in 
Cincinnati/ Was 'selected' as editor there. He accepted the 
appointment (doubtless obtained for him by Cluss so as to rid 
himself of the man) in a superb circular letter in which he says

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, between 13 and 15 January 1859]354 
Dear Engels, 
If possible, let me have an article by Tuesday (I would then do 
next Friday's"); this is crucial, as I'd like to be able to send Duncker 
'•' On Tuesdays and Fridays Marx sent articles to New York.

368 201. Marx to Engels. Between 13 and 15 January 1859 
my manuscripta by Wednesday, which would be impossible unless I 
have Tuesday free. 
The manuscript amounts to  ABOUT  12 sheets of print (3 
instalments) and—don't be bowled over by this—although entided 
Capital in General, these instalments contain nothing as yet on 
the subject of capital, but only the two chapters: L The Commodity, 
2. Money or Simple Circulation. As you can see, the part that was 
worked out in detail (in May, when I was staying with you318) is 
not to appear at all yet.355 This is good on two counts. If the thing 
is a success, the third chapter on capital can follow very soon. 
Secondly, since the matter in the published part will, by its very 
nature, prevent the curs from confining their criticism solely to 
tendentious vituperation, and since the whole thing has an 
EXCEEDINGLY serious and scientific air, the canaille will later on be 
compelled to take my views on capital RATHER SERIOUSLY. Besides, I 
believe that, all practical considerations apart, the chapter on 
money will be of interest to experts. 
I have had to alter your article on Bonaparte-Italyb somewhat, 
having myself written about the same subject on Tuesday.0 Among 
the AGENCIES which are egging Bonaparte on you forget Russia. Pam 
did not visit Paris for nothing, nor were the Russian  MOVES  IN ITALY 
without significance, nor yet Russia's coquetry with Bonaparte 
since the Peace of Paris.356 If Russia does no more than compel the 
Austrians, through Bonaparte, to sack their minister Buol and 
replace him with a Pan-Slav Russian agent, she will have achieved 
a great deal. 
As Berlin correspondent I have promised an article on the 
Prussian army which you might do ONE OF THESE DAYS.351 
In the American press Ruge is emerging as the fanatical champion of 
the Prince of Prussia. Schrammd has been given permission to return 
to Prussia (the warrant against him having been withdrawn) and to 
appear before a new jury without undergoing preventive deten­
tion.

MARX TO ENGELS 82 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 21 January [1859] 
Dear Engels, 
The ill-fated manuscript3 is ready but can't be sent off as I 
haven't a FARTHING for postage or insurance. This last is essential 
since I have no copy of it. Hence I must ask you to let me have a 
little money by Monday (POST OFFICE IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD 
CORNER). If you could send £2 it would be most welcome as I have 
put off paying various small tradesmen until Monday, after which 
any further postponements will be absolutely out of the question. 
As you can imagine, it is far from pleasant for me to burden you 
again just now when you have paid, or have got to pay, 
Freiligrath's bill. BUT IRON NECESSITY. Next week—as I am giving 
myself a week's holiday  quoadb  the next part of the manuscript—I 
shall see if I can't manage to pull off some financial coup or other. 
I don't suppose anyone has ever written about 'money' when so 
short of the  stuff.  Most autores on this SUBJECT have been on terms 
of the utmost amity with THE SUBJECT  OF THEIR RESEARCHES. 
Should the thing prove a success in Berlin, there's a chance that 
I might get out of all this mess. It's HIGH TIME I did. 
Salut. 
Your 
K. M. 
If the thing proves a success in Berlin, it might be possible to 
strike a bargain with a London publisher in respect of an English 
translation, and there's no comparison between what one is paid 
over here and in Berlin. Besides, such an EVENT would dreadfully 
annoy our worthy enemies. The canaille believed that we were 
both of us done for—the more so just now when Mr Clown 
'Edgar Bauer' has 'supplanted' us 'in the eyes of working-men', as 
Gottfried Kinkel is telling all and sundry in the City. With every 
word they publish, the canaille are making out their own death 
warrants and well may they wonder what SORT OF LIFE' we have 
preserved.

I'm uncertain whether I should mark the thing  'THE  AUTHOR 
RESERVES  TO HIMSELF  THE  RIGHT  OF TRANSLATION -. (As yOU  knOW,  there's  a 
copyright agreement between Prussia and England.) My aversion to 
all humbug and semblance of vanity or pretentiousness says 'No'. 
On the other hand my own interests say 'Yes'. The more so since 
some scrawl about monetary matters is published almost weekly in

answer since I myself must decide by Monday.

ENGELS TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH 357 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] 
Manchester, 25 January 1859 
Dear Freiligrath, 
The bloody boy who was to have got the POST OFFICE ORDER 
yesterday idled away the time instead, which is why the 22/- will 
only arrive today. Many thanks for your trouble and for the 
outlay. 
As to the Neueste Rheinische Zeitung,™ due provision has been 
made, never fear. We have in the meanwhile learnt a great deal 
and forgotten nothing, 359 and that's more than the others can say. 
Of this you could find no better illustration than the Hermann 
(clearly a misprint for Gottfried, otherwise the title's meaningless21 ), 
which you recently described as the Rheinische Zeitungs John the 
Baptist. It's a long time since I've read rubbish as insipid, 
namby-pamby, tail-wagging, lavish of compliments, conciliatory, 
propitiatory and atrociously written as is found in this, the latest 
product of the pseudo-noble sometime Maikäfer 360 which, to 
judge by its style and content, is aimed solely at and tailored to the 
tastes of the Cambeiwell philistines and the German ditto in the 
City. The man has even forgotten what little he managed to pick 
up in 1848 and has become a real bourgeois windbag. Now, since 
it was you who brought up the topic of this cheery customer, 
a An allusion to Gottfried Kinkel's weekly Hermann.

presently touting round  his  'grief,  I will  not  conceal from  you the 
fact that  I have recently been asked  by various philistines  how it is 
that you  have formed such  a bond  of friendship with Monsieur 
Kinkel. Though  an  exaggeration, this placed  me, as you can 
imagine,  in something  of a  quandary. Needless  to say, I  attributed 
it largely  to the  malicious exaggeration with which Kinkel  and 
clique  had  seized  on  what  was a  mere encounter with  you and 
blazoned  it in all the  papers  as an  offensive  and  defensive 
alliance—directed against us—and this  I roundly denied.  As for 
your social intercourse with  the  worthy citizen,  all I  could  do was 
crack  bad  jokes, such  as that, since poets live  in a  world apart, 
Kinkel could only pass himself  off as a  poet  by  citing  his 
intercourse with  you, etc.  Suffice  it to say  that, although  a poor 
diplomat,  I succeeded well enough  in  defending  the  party's 
position. Moreover,  it eventually transpired that  one of the  Jewish 
females  who  patronised  the  gentle Gottfried when  he was  last up 
here,  had  said:  'Ah,  just  let  Kinkel,  the naughty  man,  visit 
Manchester again—he seduced  a girl  of good family  in London 
and keeps  her as his  mistress,  and  that's  the  reason  why his 
wife....' 3

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 27 January 1859 
Dear Moor, 
I look forward keenly to your communication. Meanwhile 
herewith some bits of Paris gossip. 
Yesterday I wrote to Freiligrath about Kinkel, the pretext being 
provided by the good fellow  himself.  I had written to him about 
the matter of the bill, adding a few comments on the political and 
economic aspects of the international situation, and this inspired 
him to declare: 'The Hermann will undoubtedly be followed one 
day by a Neueste Rheinische Zeitung.' 358 What led him to mention 
Kinkel's rag I cannot imagine, unless he hoped to induce me to 
speak my mind on the subject of Johann Gottfried, 3 in which case 
he was not disappointed. I must say that his attempt to establish 
some sort of connection between ourselves and that rotten little 
paper annoyed me very much. The day before yesterday I tried 
twice to write him a letter, b but it was too crude, I was too angry, so 
I left the thing over until yesterday. I treated him very decently, 
but Monsieur Gottfried with considerable asperity. I told him that 
Kinkel was exploiting him in order to establish his credentials as a 
poet, since his own literary fame, spuriously acquired as a result of 
his wife's importunate advertising, would not otherwise endure; 
that the Hermann had only served to increase the contempt I had 
always felt for this vacuous, affected, dandyish jackanapes, and 
that I'd not forgiven the 'cur' the dirty tricks which he had played 
on you and me in America and was too cowardly to admit. 36 It 
was a three page letter; as I said, Freiligrath can have no 
complaint about the way I treated him but, indirectly and by 
reading between the lines, he will learn a great deal. I'm curious to 
see what he will do. 
I have had another visitor in the person of a Wuppertal poet 
and distant relation 0 of mine; in London he made straight for 
Freiligrath, of course, who wrote saying that he seemed to be a 
nice chap. I replied that he was at any rate robust, healthy and 
neither vain nor affected—qualities which, modern German poets 
a Gottfried Kinkel. Engels ironically calls him Johann after his wife, Johanna 
Kinkel. - b See this volume, pp.  370-71.  - ' Carl Siebel

being what they are, made up for a comparative lack of talent. 
Freiligrath told this chap that his salary was a thousand pounds. 
I was terribly annoyed at Freiligrath's surreptitious introduction 
of the Hermann into his letter, but he'll never play another trick of 
that kind on me, you may be sure of that. 
Many regards to your wife and children.

F. E.

207 
MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER 1 
IN MILWAUKEE 
London, 1 February 1859 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Weiwi, 
Your letter is dated 28 February 1858, arrived here (or at any 
rate reached me) at the end of May and is being answered in 
February 1859.321 This is easily explained: During the whole of 
the spring and summer I suffered from liver trouble and it 
was only with difficulty that I found time for essential work. 
Hence such writing as was not absolutely necessary was  OUT  OF THE 
QUESTION. Later in the year, however, I was overwhelmed with 
work. 
Well, to start with, I must convey cordial regards to you and 
yours from all members of the family, likewise from Engels, Lupus 
and Freiiigrath. In particular I would wish to be most kindly 
remembered to your dear wife. 
Engels is still in Manchester, also Lupus, who is giving lessons 
and doing moderately well; Freiiigrath is MANAGER of a branch of 
the Swiss Crédit mobilier 364 in London; Dronke is a commission 
agent in Glasgow; Imandt (I'm not sure if you know him) is a 
teacher in Dundee; our dear friend Weerth died in Haiti, 365 
alas,—an irreplaceable loss. 
Things have gone badly rather than well for me during the past 
2 years; for on the one side the good old Tribune made the crisis a 
pretext for halving my income although in times of prosperity 
they never gave me an extra penny; on the other, the time 
demanded by my work on political economy (of which more 
anon) compelled me (if with a heavy heart) to turn down 
very remunerative offers made me in London and Vienna. 
But I have got to pursue my object through thick and thin 
and not allow bourgeois society to turn me into a MONEY-MAKING 
MACHINE. 
Mr Cluss was over here last May. I happened to be staying with 
Engels in Manchester at the time. Cluss called on my wife and 
accepted an invitation for the following day; and who failed to put 
in an appearance? Why, Cluss! He [disappeared from London 

=====第409页=====
207. Marx to Weydemeyer. 1 February 1859 375 
and never showed his face again. Instead he sent my wife a scrawl 
to which 'embarrassment' had given an uncouth tournure." He 
didn't turn up in Manchester either. Subsequently we learned that 
he had allied himself with Mr Willich. This, then, also explains the 
mysterious discontinuation of his correspondence. If we were 
conceited we would feel duly chastened by the news that a fool 
like Willich had been able to oust us from the good graces of a 
shrewd chap like Cluss. But as it was, the whole story was so funny 
that it eliminated any bitter feelings. 
I have broken witfi Ernest Jones.245 Despite my repeated 
warnings, and although I had predicted exactly what would 
happen—namely that he would ruin himself and disorganise the 
Chartist Party—he took the course of trying to come to terms with 
the BOURGEOIS RADICALS. HE IS NOW A RUINED MAN, but the harm he has 
done to the English proletariat is incalculable. The fault will, of 
course, be rectified, but a most favourable moment for action has 
been missed. Imagine an army whose general goes over to the 
enemy camp on the eve of battle. 
You'll have heard that Mr Kinkel has become a famous man 
again because Mrs Kinkel fell out of a window and broke her 
neck. The 'cheery' customer—never has he felt so jolly as since 
the death of the old Mockel woman—promptly decided to tout 
round his  'grief.  Freiligrath allowed himself to be misled by 
Gottfried's melodramatic scenes into writing a poem about 
Johanna b which he already regrets. For he has come to realise, 
firstly, that Gottfried is merry as a grig, and secondly that he 
immediately used the poem to disseminate to all and sundry the 
lie that Freiligrath had entered into an alliance with him and 
broken with us. A week later, in an attempt to exploit the Kinkel 
REVIVAL sparked off by his wife's death, Gottfried published 
in London a weekly dubbed the Hermann; unless this is the 
Hermann sung by Schönaich c and crowned by Gottsched, 366 the 
title ought to be Gottfried. In the first place the rag preaches 
peace with God and the world, d and secondly it is nothing more 
than a puff for Mr Gottfried vis-à-vis German Philistia in the 
City of London. Nothing more pitiful has ever seen the light 
of day, and we can thank our stars that the 10 years of exile 
have so completely laid bare the hollowness of our democratic 
friends. The Kölnische Zeitung is witty and daring by com­
parison.

What is really choice about Kinkel's exploitation of his wife's 
death is that the latter creature, who was suffering from heart 
disease, was outraged because our suave parson had seduced a 
Jewess by the name of Herz, and generally treated her 'coldly'. In 
Manchester the Jewish women swear that this 1 is the reason why 
Johanna Mockel of blessed memory fell out of the window. 
Anyhow, this would show that, inane though Gottfried may be in 
other respects, he is cunning enough to exploit public CREDULITY. 
But that's enough about this humbug. 
The wind of revolution which is blowing across the Continent of 
Europe has, of course, awakened all the great men367 from their 
winter sleep. 
At the same time as this letter, I am sending one—indeed, my 
first—to Komp. I have given up associations—organised ones. 
They were, I thought, compromising for our friends in Germany. 
Over  here,  on the other hand, after the dirty tricks I have suffered 
at the hands of the louts who have allowed themselves to be used 
as mere tools against myself by a Kinkel, a Willich or some other 
such humbug, and since the Cologne trial," I have withdrawn 
completely into my study. My time was too precious to be wasted 
in fruitless endeavour and petty squabbles. 
And now for essentials. My Critique of Political Economy is to be 
published in instalments (the first ones in a week or ten days' 
timea ) by Franz Duncker of Berlin (Bessersche Verlagsbuchhand­
lung).  It was only thanks to Lassalle's extraordinary zeal and 
powers of persuasion that Duncker was induced to take this step. 
He has, however, left himself a loophole. A firm contract depends on 
the sale of the first instalments. 
I divide the whole of political economy into 6 books. 
Capital; landed property; wage labour; the State; foreign trade; 
world market. 
Book I, on capital, comprises 4 sections. 
Section I: Capital in general comprises 3 chapters, 1. The 
Commodity; 2. Money, or simple circulation; 3. Capital. 1 and 2,  ABOUT 
10 sheets, make up the contents of the first instalments to be 
published. You will understand the political motives that led me to 
hold back the third chapter on 'Capital' until I have again become 
established. 
The contents of the instalments now being published are as 
follows:

A. Historical notes on the analysis of commodities. {William Petty

A. Smith, J.-B. Say; Bullion Committee,0  Ricardo, James Mill; Lord 
Overstone and school; Thomas Tooke (James Wilson, John 
Fullarton).} 
In these two chapters the Proudhonist socialism now FASHIONABLE 
in France—which wants to retain private production while 
organising the exchange of private products, to have commodities 
but not money—is demolished to its very foundations. Commu­
nism must above all rid itself of this 'false brother'.*1 But apart 
from all polemical aims, the analysis of simple money forms is, you 
know, the most difficult because the most abstract part of political 
economy. 
I hope to win a scientific victory for our party. But the latter 
must itself now show whether its numbers are great enough to buy 
enough copies to banish the publisher's 'moral scruples'. The 
continuation of the venture depends on the sale of the first

Dear Lassalle, 
The manuscript" went off from here on 26 January; by 31 
January notification had already got back here from Berlin that the 
manuscript had arrived. The parcels company received this 
notification from their correspondent. On the other hand there is 
your letter dated 31 January in which you say the manuscript 
hasn't arrived. So whatever the circumstances the Prussian govern­
ment— friend Stieber perhaps—has spent 3 days rummaging 
throughb the manuscript. Legally, so far as I am aware, all they 
were empowered to do was ascertain whether the parcel contained 
Brussels lace, other parcels being no concern of theirs. Who is 
going to assure me that some junior official hasn't amused himself 
by using a page or 2 for spills? 
I presume that, in its own interest, the Prussian government 
hasn't taken any  FALSE  STEPS  with my manuscript. Otherwise I should 
see to it that all hell was let loose in the London press (Times, 
etc.).

Today came a letter (which I'll send you later) from Lassalle 
saying that the manuscript0 has not yet arrived. Now take note: It 
went off on Tuesday (25); I was notified as early as 30th January 
by the PACKET COMPANY here that the manuscript had arrived in 
Berlin. Lassalle's letter is dated 31 January. Hence the government 
has been holding back my manuscript for 3 or 4 days at least (if 
Duncker got the manuscript after Lassalle's letter went off). Maybe 
Mr Stieber has been rummaging through0 it, or Mr von Patow has 
been endeavouring to make a hasty acquaintance with economics.

Dear Lassalle, 
I've not yet had an acknowledgment of receipt from Mr 
Duncker and am therefore still in doubt whether the manuscript3 
is yet out of the clutches of the authorities. You will see from the 
enclosed note that it left London on 26 January. 
Ad vocem bellumh: The general view here is that war in Italy is 
inevitable.370 This much is certain: Mr Emmanuelc is in earnest 
and Mr Bonaparte was in earnest. What has swayed the latter is 
1. Fear of Italian daggers.371 Since Orsini's death, he has been 
constantly engaged in secret 'intrigues with the Carbonari, the

exceedingly bleak financial situation: it is, in fact, impossible to go on 
feeding the French army 'in peacetime'; Lombardy is fat and 
fertile. Moreover a war would again make 'war loans' possible. Any 
other loan is 'impossible'. 3. Over the last two years Bonaparte's

something has got to happen if his prestige is to be restored. Even 
in the rural areas there is a great deal of grumbling about the 
ruinously low price of grain and Mr Bonaparte has tried in vain to 
push up the price of wheat artificially by means of his decrees on 
granaries.3  4. The parvenu in the Tuileries is being egged on by 
Russia. Given the Pan-Slav movement in Bohemia, Moravia, 
Galicia, southern, northern and eastern Hungary, Illyria, etc., and 
a war in Italy, Russia would almost certainly break the resistance 
that Austria continues to offer her. (Russia regards the prospect of 
an internal agrarian revolution with horror, and war abroad might 
come as a welcome diversion to the government, quite apart from 
any diplomatic objectives.) 5. Mr Plon-Plon, son of the ex-King of 
Westphalia, b and his clique (headed by Girardin and a very mixed 
bag of Hungarian, Polish and Italian pseudo-revolutionaries) are 
doing all in their power to force the issue. 6. A war against Austria 
in Italy is the only one in which England, who cannot take a direct 
stand for the Pope, etc., and against so-called liberty, would remain 
neutral, at least at the start. Russia, however, would keep Prussia 
in check should the latter feel inclined, which I doubt, to intervene 
at the very outset of the campaign. 
On the other hand one may be perfectly sure that Mr Louis 
Bonaparte is devilishly afraid of a really serious war. 1. The man 
is always full of misgivings and, like all gamblers, is far from 
resolute. He has always inched his way to the Rubicon,372 but 
those standing behind him have invariably had to chuck him in. In 
every case—Boulogne, Strasbourg, December 1851s73 —he was, in 
the end, forced to proceed in earnest with his plans. 2. The 
exceptionally cool reception accorded his scheme in France is not 
encouraging, of course. The masses appear to be  INDIFFERENT.  On 
the other hand there have been outright and earnest remonstra-
tions against it on the part of high finance, trade and industry, the 
clerical party and, finally, the senior generals (Pélissier, for 
example, and Canrobert). Indeed, prospects on the military side 
are far from rosy, even if the braggadocio in the  Constitutionnel""  is 
taken at its face value. Assuming France can muster all in all 
700,000 men, 580,000 of these, at the very highest estimate, will 
be fit for military service. Deduct 50,000 for Algiers; 49,000 
gendarmes, etc.; 100,000 (minimum) for guarding the cities (Paris, 
a Napoleon III, Decree on grain reserves of 16 November 1858, Le Moniteur universel, 
No. 322, 18 November 1858. - b Jerome Bonaparte - c  This refers to the article 
marked 'L. Boniface. Paris, le 29 janvier' in Le Constitutionnel, No. 30, 30 January

etc.) and fortresses of France; 181,000 at least for the army 
keeping watch on the Swiss, German and Belgian frontiers. This 
leaves 200,000 which, even if you add the minuscule Piedmontese 
army, is by no means AN OVERWHELMING FORCE to employ against 
the Austrians in their fortified positions on the Mincio and the 
Adige. 
However that may be, if Mr Bonaparte draws back now, he will 
be done for so far as the bulk of the French army is concerned; 
and this might ultimately induce him to go ahead after all. 
You apparently believe that in the event of such a war Hungary 
would rise. I very much doubt it. Austria will, of course, place a 
corps on the Galician-Hungarian frontier to observe the Russians, 
and this will simultaneously keep the Hungarians in check. The 
Hungarian regiments (in so far as they have not—and many of 
them already have—been dispersed among their enemies, e.g. the 
Czechs, Serbs, Slovenes, etc.) will be stationed in German 
provinces. 
The war would, of course, have serious, and without doubt 
ultimately revolutionary consequences. But initially it will maintain 
Bonapartism in France, set back the internal movement within 
England and Russia, revive the pettiest nationalist passions in 
Germany, etc., and hence, in my view, its initial effect will 
everywhere be counter-revolutionary. 
Be that as it may, you should expect nothing of the émigrés here. 
Apart from Mazzini who, at least, is a fanatic, they're a bunch of 
confidence tricksters whose one ambition is to extract money from 
the English. Mr Kossuth has positively sunk to the level of an 
itinerant LECTURER who hawks the same old nonsense round the 
various PROVINCES of England and Scotland and sells it over and 
over again to ever new audiences. a 
The scoundrels here have all become so conservative that they 
would indeed deserve to be amnestied. Mr Gottfried Kinkel, for 
example, is publishing a weekly here, Hermann by name, 
compared with which even the Kölnische Zeitung is a daring and 
witty paper. (By indulging in sundry flirtations with aesthetic 
Jewesses, the suave, melodramatic parson is said, amongst other 
things, to have driven his wife to fall out of the window and break 
her neck. Freiligrath, being a kind-hearted fellow, was so taken in 
by the scenes of grief that he wrote a poem about the late Johanna 
Mockel, b only to discover a day or two later that the grief was

merely feigned and that never had Mr Gottfried felt so FREE and 
EASY as since the death of his spouse.) The fellow preaches 
'optimism' in a namby-pamby, hat-doffing, somewhat breathless 
manner. The paper should be called Gottfried. For my part I 
would rather write under Manteuffel's yoke than under that of the 
German philistines in the City of London. To Mr Kinkel, however, 
the yoke is all the sweeter and lighter for the fact of his being not 
one jot superior to the said philistines where character and insight 
are concerned. The to-do made by the 'Lewald' woman, alias 
'Stahr', about the late Mockel has compromised the latter person 
still further. 374

Dingelstedt (of Fulda), through whom he hopes to arrange a 
performance of a play he himself has written. In addition, the little 
man writes 'Glasgower Briefe' for Prutz's Museum. b I had all this 
news from philistine Freiligrath. 
From the latter, who came to see me yesterday (I myself being 
confined to the house with a bad throat), I also learned that 
Gottfried's—or Hermann'sc —behaviour towards ladies is invari­
ably so ludicrous (the buffoon now supposes he need only throw 
down his handkerchief) that he has become an object of general 
dégoût. d Moreover, Freiligrath has now also tumbled to the fact 
that Gottfried feels exceptionally 'FREE  AND  EASY'  now that the Mockel 
woman e is dead and—strangest of all—it now transpires that, even 
before the day of the funeral, philistine Freiligrath and wife had 
discovered brother Hermann's 'lack of concern'. 
According to Gottfried, the Hermann, to which the Prussian 
government has, as the Berlin National-Zeitung announces, granted 
a licence for postal distribution, is to cover the 'loss' to his funds 
occasioned by his wife's death. 
In due course, no doubt, Mrs Daniels will become Mrs Bürgers. 
She has written to Lina f saying that 'Bürgers has grown still more 
energetic and self-confident'. In proof of that 'self-confidence' 
she writes, 'we are delighted by Freiligrath's poem about Mrs 
Kinkel/ which was mutilated by the "perfidious" Kölnische 
Zeitung'.

Ad vocem3  Freiligrath. I came, most opportunely for him, on the 
very day he got your letter. b He gave it to me to read and excused 
himself for the non-political nature of the poemc on the grounds 
that he was a 'poet'. Also said he had written to you about the 
Hermann simply as a 'joke'.d  WELL,  AFTER  THESE  VERY  MEAGRE  EXPLANATIONS, 
he said he would write and tell you that he had made everything 
ALL RIGHT  with me. By the by, your letter 'tickled' him tremendously. 
I told him that it was 'very well written' and he, of course, couldn't 
help laughing at me for looking to 'style' first of all ON SUCH AN 
OCCASION. The FACT is, Freiligrath realises that Kinkel has used him 
and, having used him, is actually becoming somewhat uppish 
towards him. (Thus, to Freiligrath's intense annoyance, the 
'Schriften von Gottfried und Johanna Kinkel' figure in large type 
among the Hermann's advertisements and, under the same 
heading, 'F. Freiligraths Gedichte' in small type, so that Freiligrath's 
poems are annexed to the works of Gottfried and Johanna. This 
greatly riles our philistine.) On the other hand, Freiligrath is very 
much beholden to Kinkel for having, apparently against all 
expectations, again put him in the way of a political purgative 
which,  BY THE BY, and if I am not mistaken, has earned him high 
praise and even, it is said, presents from philistines in Germany. 
Nota bene: Mrs Daniels wrote to Lina e (in reply to some quips 
about the Kinkel CASE the latter had sent her): 'We' (she and 
Heinrich, the quiet one') 'are delighted and entranced by Freilig­
rath's poem' and the day-dreaming Heinrich, who had grown 'still 
more self-confident and still more energetic', had actually discov­
ered that 'the perfidious' Kölnische Zeitung had suppressed the 
'most important verse', a verse which existed only in Heinrich's 
Olympian imagination. 
What's this about Blind? 
Apropos. Did you and Lupus see in the papers (maybe a month

Main content Military  proof,  i.e. based on military science, that 
all the reasons advanced to the effect that Austria must have the 
Mincio line in order to protect Germany, correspond precisely to 
the argument that France must have the Rhine frontier in order 
to protect  herself;  further that, whereas Austria's interest in the 
Mincio line is considerable, that of Germany, as a single power, is 
nil, and that Italy will always be dominated militarily by Germany 
so long as the whole of Switzerland isn't French. The thing is 
mainly directed against the strategists of the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung, but otherwise against Mr Bonaparte—from a national 
viewpoint, of course. 
I am willing to stake all my 'powers of discernment'3 on the fact 
that the publication of this pamphlet, which will entail hardly any 
outlay because consisting of only a few sheets, would, at the 
present time, actually be a speculation (IN THE  EMINENT  SENSE  OF THE  WORD) 
for a bookseller. 
Since taking part in the Baden campaign,380  Engels has made 
military matters his special study. Added to which his writing, as 
you know, is exceedingly plausible. 
However, the publisher must preserve the secret of the writer's identity 
until the AUTHOR himself chooses to disclose it. You may be sure 
that the most eminent military writers of Prussia will be suspected 
of being at the bottom of the thing. 
Now here we have something the publication of which is 
intimately related to the times—a question of the day. Hence it 
must be pushed through quickly. Do you think that Duncker will 
agree to do it? It would undoubtedly be in his own interests. One 
can never know in the case of purely scientific stuff whether and 
to what extent the philistines will buy it. Where questions of the 
day such as these are concerned, this can be calculated with almost 
mathematical exactitude. 
Should Duncker agree, Engels authorises you to conclude the 
transaction in his name and on whatever terms you think fit. 
Should he refuse, might there not be some other possibility? I 
know a publisher in Hamburg who would take it. b But this fellow 
was always personally hostile to the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, as he 
plainly told our friend Heine, and hence it would vex me sorely 
were he to obtain so much as a single line from any of us. Besides, 
he treated our never-to-be-forgotten and irreplaceable friend 
Weerth in the most outrageous fashion.

[London,] 25 February' 1859 
Dear Engels, 
Po and Rhine is a first-class idea and must be put in hand 
straight away. 379 You must set to at once, time being everything in 
this case. I have written to Lassalle this very day and am sure that 
little Jew Braun will put the thing through. 
The pamphlet  (HOW  MANY  SHEETS?  Let me have the answer to this by 
return) must first appear anonymously so that the public believes the 
author to be an eminent general. In the second edition, which you 
may account a certainty provided the thing comes out on time, 
you will reveal your identity in a 6-I.INF. foreword, and then it will 
be a triumph for our party. In my 'Preface'b  I have done you a 
few honneurs; and thus it is all to the good if you yourself take the 
stage immediately afterwards. 
Those dogs of democrats and liberal riff-raff will see that we're 
the only chaps who haven't been stultified by the ghastly period of 
peace. 
In any case, you'll get the copies of the Tribune. Not one of the 
military articles'^ has so far been published. Mr Dana didn't print 
the first, which you wrote  A LONG  TIME  AGO,  but will probably do so 
now. I too constantly experience the like. It's often three months 
before the asses discover that we've foretold EVENTS for them, 
whereupon they print the relevant articles.

MARX  TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  25 February  1859 
Dear Engels, 
I am  writing  to you  again  this evening  because  TIME PRESSES.  I am 
morally convinced that,  in  view  of  what  I've  written  to  Lassalle, 
Duncker will accept  the  pamphlet. b Admittedly, little  Jew  Braun 
hasn't written  to me  since  my  manuscript 0 arrived,  and  that  was 
over four weeks  ago. For one  thing,  he was  busy with  the 
publication  of his own  immortal,  'inflammatory'  workd  (STILL,  the 
little  Jew,  even  his  Heraclitus," although atrociously written,  is 
BETTER THAN ANYTHING  THE  DEMOCRATS COULD BOAST  OF),  and then he will 
probably have  to do the  final proof-reading  of my  scrawl.  For 
another thing,  he may be a  trifle stunned  by the  terrible knock  on 
the head dealt  him  indirectly  by my  analysis  of money.  For his 
Heraclitus contains  the  following note which  I shall  now  quote 
verbatim despite  its  interminable length (you've  got to  read  it, 
though): 
'If we  remarked above that  in the  said fragment Heraclitus  has  specified  the 
true nature  and  function  of money  in political economy' (Heraclitus  in fact says: 
a Johann Carl Juta  - b F. Engels,  Po and Rhine.  - ' A  Contribution  to the  Critique of 
Political Economy  - d F.  Lassalle, Franz  von  Sickingen.  - e F. Lassalle,  Die  Philosophie 
Herakleilos des Dunklen von Ephesos. Further  on Marx quotes Note  3 to p.  224 of Vol.  I 
of this work.

'irvpôs T'avTafieCßEO-Sai navra xoà irûp àirâvKO'y <5oirEp XP^ 0™' XP"nM-aTa;. x<*l 
XptlM-âTwv xP"0"°s'a ). 'this, we need hardly point out, is not to make a political eco­
nomist of him, and hence it is far from our intention to suggest that he had grasped 
any of the wider implications of that fragment. But although this science neither 
existed nor could have existed at that time and therefore was not the object of 
Heraclitus' thought, it is correct to say that, precisely because he never goes by 
reflex categories but only by the speculative concept, Heraclitus has, in that frag­
ment, discerned the nature of money in all its profundity and this more truly than 
many a modern economist. And it may not be altogether without interest or, 
indeed, so irrelevant as might at first appear, to observe how what is simply a 
consequence of that thought automatically gives rise to the modern discoveries in 
this field.' b (Nota bene. Lassalle doesn't know the first thing about these disco­
veries.) 
'When Heraclitus suggests that money as a medium of exchange is the antithesis 
of all real products entering exchange and owes its real existence solely to the same' 
(I underline where Lassalle has underlined), 'this is not to say that money as such is 
itself a product invested with a material value of its own, one commodity among 
other commodities, as Say's school' (a nice Continental  DELUSION  that there is such a 
thing as Say's school) 'persists in regarding coin up to this very day; rather it is but 
the ideal representative of circulating real products, a symbol of value for the latter, 
which merely stands for them. And that is only in part a conclusion drawn from the 
fragment, in part only the concept implicit in it for Heraclitus  himself. 
'But if all money is merely the ideal unit or expression of value of all real 
circulating products and owes its real existence solely to these, which are at one and 
the same time its antithesis, it follows from the very consequence' (nice style! It 
follows from 'the very consequence') 'of this concept that a country's sum of values 
or its wealth may be increased only by an increase in real products, but never by an 
increase in money since money, of course, far from being even merely a factor of 
wealth and value' (now we have wealth and value; before it was sum of values or 
wealth), 'never expresses, as an abstract unit, more than the value which is situated 
in the products' (and a nice district, tooc), 'and is real only therein. Hence the error 
of the balance of trade system.' (This is worthy of Ruge.) 'It further follows that All 
money is always equal in value to all circulating products, since it merely reduces the 
latter to an ideal unit of value, hence merely gives expression to their value; hence 
that, by an increase or decrease in the amount of money available, the value of this 
total sum of money will never be affected and will always remain equal only to that 
of all circulating products; that strictly speaking it is never possible to talk of the 
value of all money as compared with the value of all circulating products, because 
such a comparison supposes that the value of money and the value of products are 
two values in their own right, whereas only one value exists, which is realised in 
concrete form in the material product, and expressed as an abstract unit of value in 
money; or rather, value itself is nothing but a unit abstracted from real things, in 
which it does not exist as such, and finding its special expression in money; not 
only, then, does the value of all money remain equal to the value of all products 
but, properly speaking, all money is only the value of all circulating products.' (This 
ultra-bold type is the author's.) 'Hence it follows that, with an increase in the 
•' 'All things are exchanged for fire and fire for all things, as wares are exchanged for 
gold and gold for wares.' Here and below the insertions in parentheses are 
Marx's. - h Marx's italics - c  An allusion to a joke current at the time: one woman tells 
another of her son's death in action near Leipzig (1813), whereupon the other 
remarks: 'And a nice district, too!' ('Auch eine schöne Gegend!')

quantity of coin, since the value of the total remains the same, that of each 
individual coin can only fall, just as it will rise again with a decrease in the quantity 
of coin. It further follows that, since money is merely the unreal theoretical 
abstraction of value and represents the antithesis of real products and materials, 
money as such does not need to have any intrinsic reality, i.e. need not consist of 
any truly valuable material, but may equally be paper money, and it is precisely 
then that it corresponds most closely to its concept. All these and many other 
conclusions, which have only been reached, and along entirely different lines, since 
Ricardos studies and have by no means found universal acceptance, follow from the 
mere consequence of that speculative concept discerned by Heraclitus.' 
I, of course, paid not the slightest heed to this Talmudic wisdom 
but roundly slated Ricardo for his theory of money which, by the 
way, did not originate with him but with Hume and Montesquieu. 
So Lassalle may feel this to be a personal insult. There was actually 
no harm in it, for in my anti-Proudhon piece" I myself adopted 
Ricardo's theory. But I'd had a perfecdy ridiculous letter from 
little Jew Braun in which he said that he had 'the early publication 
of my manuscript at heart, although he himself was engaged in 
writing a major work on political economy' 278 for which he had 
'allocated two years'. But if I were to 'deprive him of too much 
that was new, he might abandon the whole thing'. WELL, to this I 
replied that there was no fear of rivalry since this 'new' science 
could accommodate himself and me and a dozen more besides.b 
My disquisition on money will now show him, either that I know 
nothing of the subject—although if I'm wrong, so is the whole 
history of the monetary theory—or else that he is an ass, since, 
with a few empty abstract expressions such as 'abstract unit', he 
presumes to lay down the law about empirical matters which, if 
one wishes to hold forth about them, call for study, and prolonged 
study INTO THE BARGAIN. For this reason he may, in the innermost 
recesses of his heart, be nourishing something of a grudge against 
me just now. But—and this is what I have been leading up 
to—firstly, Lassalle has really too great a stake 'in the cause' and, 
secondly, he is too much of an 'Ephraim Artful' not to keep in 
with us coûte que coûte, c which is all the more necessary to him 
because of his quarrel with the Düsseldorf people. d Moreover, 
living in Berlin has made him see that, for an energetic fellow 
like himself,  the bourgeois party holds out no prospects what­
ever. 381 
So with clever MANAGEMENT the man will be ours, body and soul, 
no matter how much he indulges in 'inflammatory' antics or makes

Heraclitus pay for being the most succinct of philosophers by 
providing him with the most prolix of commentaries. For the same 
reason I am sure that en cas de besoin 1 he will force Duncker to take 
your pamphlet. I have, by the by, so framed my letter that he can 
show the whole of it to Duncker. It was, in fact, written for 
Duncker rather than Lassalle, though for all his artfulness 
Ephraim is unlikely to notice the fact. 
Hence I consider it certain that Duncker will take the pamphlet, 
so the main thing now is for you to set to work on it at once, for 
this is like a newspaper article. There's no time to be lost. For the 
same reason—immediacy of impact—I believe you shouldn't 
exceed 4 or 5 sheets (if as much is needed). So you may regard 
yourself as totally absolved from the Tribune work (unless some 
martial occurrence steals a march on your pamphlet, which is 
improbable), until you've finished the thing. The most sensible 
thing to do would be to plead sudden illness and stay away from 
the office, so as to write the thing all at one go.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 March 1859 
Dear Engels, 
From the enclosed letter of Lassalle's382 you will see that I know 
my men and what MANAGEMENT means. 
As regards the letter, I would make the following observations: 
1. You must now really follow my advice and shun the office 
altogether for a few days. I did, of course, put the thing in such a 
way as to suggest that I'd already read your manuscript.3 A few 
days here or there are of no importance, but if you only work in 
the evenings you won't finish in time. 
2. In your position you cannot agree to the small fee but must, 
if only honoris causa, settle for the alternative of half the net 
profits. 
3. Lassalle's direction that you send the title (i.e. not write it on 
the manuscript), the foreword (which I'd suggest you don't write) 
and the table of contents to him personally (F. Lassalle, 131 
Potsdamer Strasse, Berlin), is a sensible one. For parcels are being 
opened by the Post Office, and the government mustn't know the 
title,  which would give them the key to the whole secret. 
The manuscript, on the other hand, I shall send from here, as I 
sent my own manuscriptb  (i.e. insured), to Duncker via Fräulein 
Ludmilla Assing. Only I'll get Pfänder to put himself down as the 
sender. 
4. You should indeed include something national, anti-
Bonapartist, but the tone should be careful and gentlemanly. You 
can the more readily employ this colour in that the intention of 
your pamphlet is, IN FACT, a great victory for Mazzini vis-à-vis the 
National Assembly of 1848 (Radowitz c-Mincio),383 and you enable 
Germans for the first time to interest themselves with a good 
conscience in Italy's emancipation. 
Now, GOOD-BYE, OLD BOY.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
[Manchester,] 4 March 1859 
Dear Moor, 
Little Jew Braun d has managed things well; I agree to half the 
net profits. The work is going ahead fairly quickly," 9 long double 
pages of the kind I send you for the Tribune are ready, 2 or 3 
more will see the finish of the Po and then comes the Rhine, 
which won't be as long—barely 3 sheets in all. This evening, 
Saturday and Sunday will certainly dispose of the better part of 
the thing, and I shall let you have it by Wednesday, provided all 
goes smoothly. However I must be on my guard since I'll have all 
the official military writers against me, and if they can pick any 
holes in the thing they'll certainly do so. So better too short than 
too long, and the historical examples can be done quite briefly. 
Besides, if the manuscript arrives in Berlin at the end of next 
week, it will be soon enough; after all, there's going to be war. 370 
So there's no need to worry about time. It's impossible just now to 
absent myself from the WAREHOUSE for several days. There's no real 
need and it wouldn't be much help. What holds one up is poring

Dear Engels, 
Pamphlet1' received. Will run to about 4 printed sheets if not 
more, considering the way pamphlets are printed. Have read it all; 
EXCEEDINGLY  CLEVER;  the political side is also splendidly done and that 
was damned difficult. THE PAMPHLET WILL HAVE  A GREAT SUCCESS. 
I've deleted nothing but one short sentence about Reuss-Schleiz; 
not where you discuss the 'natural frontiers' of that state1  but in 
the first passage where it makes for double emploi 6 and detracts 
from the effect. 
I suggest that the subtitle 'Military Studies' detracts from the 
effect and should be deleted. 
Should you be writing to Lassalle tomorrow I'd like you to do 
something in your own name which I can't do in mine. The FACTS 
are as follows: Last Monday (7 March) something arrived from 
Berlin! What do you think it was? The first proof-sheet' and since 
then I have not had another. Contrary to what Mr Duncker  expressly 
said in his letter, they did nothing at all about my manuscript for 6 
weeks and would now seem to be printing 1 sheet a week. When 
your manuscript arrives they'll perhaps break off again and thus 
the thing may drag on for months. I find this quite deplorable,

and you might  DROP  SOME  WORDS  in your own name to Lassalle about 
the matter. 3 Do the fellows want to put the piece off until the very 
eve of war,370 thereby ensuring that it comes to nothing and giving 
Mr Duncker an excuse to refuse the sequel? 
Besides, I was counting on the money, and this delay has 
rendered intolerable my already distressing mode of existence. On 
this occasion Freiligrath (who is seeking IN EVERY  WAY to reestablish 
himself)b was decent enough to try and negotiate bills for me here 
in London. However the thing came to nothing. 
Apropos the Tribune. For the past 6 weeks they have not 
published one article either of yours or mine. The intrigues 
associated with a presidential election are already BEGINNING. In the 
light of experience I should say that the omission of our articles 
was a preliminary manoeuvre enabling them to notify me that they 
will only be requiring one article per week for the time being. 
Salut.

I believe there will be war. However, a diplomatic intermezzo is 
necessary, partly on account of the clamour in Germany, partly on 
account of the vociferousness of the French bourgeoisie, lastly on 
account of the English Parliament; perhaps also in order that 
Russia may in the meantime extort sundry concessions from 
Austria. The Russians have achieved one main object. In 1846, 
when, for the first time, Austria's finances showed no deficit, 
Russia used the Cracow affair384 to plunge her back into the most 
appalling financial predicament. In 1858 the Austrians appeared 
to have got their finances in some sort of order and announced an 
immediate payment by the Bank, which is why Bonaparte was 
promptly sent into the field and Austria's finances are back where 
they were in 1848. The dissolution of Parliament, the absence of 
government here in the interim, and subsequently Palmerston as 
FOREIGN MINISTER385 are similarly moves required by Russia for the 
purpose of war.

ENGELS TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 14 March 1859 
6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Street 
Dear Lassalle, 
First of all my thanks for your bons offices" with Duncker, which 
have met with such outstanding success and will, for the first time 
in nearly ten years, give me the opportunity of appearing before 
the German public. I sent the manuscript to Marx last Wednes­
day 15 and he will have forwarded it on Thursday. The title page 
should read simply Po and Rhine, Berlin, Published by ... etc., etc. 
Marx and I both consider it better that the thing should first 
appear anonymously because specialised and, at the start, the 
name of a civilian could only be detrimental to a military paper. If 
the thing is successful, as I hope, it will be time enough to put my 
name to it. There's no need for a table of contents, the sections 
being merely numbered. Nor have I written a foreword. 
Marx thinks it will amount to 4 sheets, which I doubt, but it all 
depends on the printing, of course. 
As regards terms, I have decided in favour of half the net 
profits; it goes without saying, of course, that there should be the 
usual number of free copies, one of which you must naturally 
bespeak in advance. They can be sent through publisher's 
channels, though I'd like one (or else proofs) to be sent direct to 
me by post. I might bring it out in English. The matter lends itself 
less readily to a French translation which would, furthermore, be 
difficult to place; however, I shall see. 
How is the printing of Marx's manuscript' getting on? So far 
I've only heard of one sheet having been printed, and yet the 
manuscript has been in Berlin for over a month. This seems to me 
very slow. One or two instalments at least should be out in time 
for the Leipzig FairWh and there's not long to go. 
Reiterated promises notwithstanding, Marx hasn't yet sent me 
your Heraclitus,d which I greatly look forward to seeing, although 
both my Greek and the speculative concept have grown exceeding­
ly rusty. I am equally anxious to read your play,e which I have

expected  you to  take  up this speciality  as well. 
Since  I've  been here  I have been devoting myself largely  to 
militaria, also dallying  at intervals with  an old  love, comparative 
philology.  But  when  one has  engaged  in noble commerce  all day 
long,  it's impossible  to go  beyond sheer dilettantism  in so  vast and 
extensive  a discipline.  And  even though  I once cherished  the 
brash idea  of writing  a comparative grammar  of the  Slavonic 
languages,  I gave  it up  long  ago, the  more  so since Miklosicha  has 
undertaken  the  same thing with such brilliant success. 
So once again very many thanks  and  kind regards from your

has already written recently  in the  Zeit. 1

CLOWN has turned into a real preacher. He doesn't dare attack the

Kinkel's paper is doing excellent business. Prudently, he has 
quite given up writing  himself.  The money comes partly from a

Dear Lassalle, 
Your latest work b and accompanying letter have not yet arrived, 
nor are they to be here so soon. Despatch through publisher's 
channels is about as expeditious as if you were to send me the 
things via Petersburg, Kamchatka and North America. 
If it's not too late, get them to print 'THE RIGHT OF TRANSLATION IS 
RESERVED' on the last manuscript1 I sent you. Otherwise some of the 
German clowns over here might massacre the thing. 
Owing to circumstances which I can't go into today (for I am 
dictating an article in English d while writing this note to you), I am 
very hard pressed for money. Might it be possible for you to carry 
out some sort of bill transaction for me in Berlin having a 
currency of a few weeks, in return for which you could 
subsequently take the fee Duncker owes me?

Yesterday I had a visitor from Paris, a man by whose judgment 
I set tremendous store. Speaking of war,370  he said: Tl n'y a pas 
deux opinions à Paris. Notts avons la guerre.'  * He was quite convinced 
that, were Bonaparte to draw back, he would crack up and, LIKE 
the Empereur Soulouque, would be betrayed by the army  itself. 
Even the Parisian bourgeois, though rabid for peace, are already 
beginning to mutter that the fellow has no more courage than 
Louis Philippe. 
There's one factor, by the by, which you must not overlook; 
Russia is stirring up the whole thing, and her ally, Palmerston (you 
only have to look at The Times) is doing all he can to drive 
Bonaparte to war. On top of that there'll soon be a change of 
ministry here, and then Palmerston will run the thing direct.385 
The pro-Poerio, etc., demonstrations here are wholly inspired by 
him. He has placed his son-in-law, Lord Shaftesbury, at the head 
of these,  AS  RESPONSIBLE EDITOR.38 
I am now,  AFTER  ALL, beginning to believe that the war might hold 
out some prospects for us as well.

Dear Engels, 
I think you have misunderstood Lassalle's letter.3 
All he says is: 
'I'm most anxious to see what the pamphletb contains. Marx's 
workc  will alsobe appearing soon, etc' By this he means he has not 
read your pamphlet. Voilà tout. d The same affectation as in the case 
of my manuscript which he purports not to have  read.  I had a letter 
from him this morning which I shall send on to you later. Had 
your manuscript not arrived he would at least have told me. 
Your manuscript left London the same day as it arrived. Pfänder 
was given a receipt for it. Anyway it is sure to have arrived.

means, namely writing to my mother asking her if she will lend 
me the money for a few weeks. Je verrai. 3 Here in London a bill 
could have been negotiated only through Gerstenberg. But the 
latter, a petty pompous gentleman and Kinkel's patron, shall not 
have the gratification of being asked to do me a service, even a 
purely formal one. 
Ad vocetn Duncker. This Wednesday (day after tomorrow), the 
man will have had the manuscriptb  for almost 9 weeks. So far I've 
been sent only 3  proof-sheets.  Between ourselves I should say quite 
frankly that Duncker is regretting having undertaken the business 
and that's why he is handling it in this dilatory, Wetzlar 
chancellery fashion. 391 If he goes on like this the thing won't even 
be out by Easter. And this puts me in another quandary. I am 
negotiating with an Englishman over the English rendering of 
these first instalments. This last depends, of course, on the 
publication of the work in German, and since everything is done 
at high pressure in London, the Englishman is growing mistrust­
ful. You absolutely cannot make an Englishman understand the 
German way of doing business. 
You will see that the first section does not comprise the 
principal chapter, i.e. the 3rd, on capital. I thought this advisable 
on political grounds, for it's in III that the battle really begins and 
it seemed to me better not to frighten people de prime  abord.' 
Ad vocem telegraphy. I ACCEPT THE OFFER.392 The matter isn't as 
simple as you think. Obtaining the information is nothing, but 
takes up a great deal of time. I shall set up office near the Exchange 
(where the telegraphic companies who despatch the things also 
have their offices). However, your cousind must now let me know: 
1. By what route does he want the despatches sent? There are 3 
companies, one sends via France, the second via Ostend and the 
third via Antwerp. The only things which should be sent via 
France, I think, are those for which no French censorship can 
present a danger. This is, incidentally, the shortest route. 2. What 
does he want telegraphed? Different papers base their views of 
what is important on very different principles. 3. How frequently 
does he want me to telegraph? 4. Besides NEWS from England, do 
these people want news from America, in short, from outside 
Europe? He must give me exact instructions about all this since 
telegraphy demands first and foremost that all non-essentials 
should be omitted. 5. Finally, I must know at what hour of the day 
a I shall see. - h K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. - ' at the 
very outset - d  Max Friedländer

the Presse prefers to receive its news (in the English provinces, at 
any rate, this varies with individual newspapers, according to the 
time they come out). In the case of extraordinary events no time 
could, of course, be laid down, as it could, presumably, for 
ordinary despatches. For stock-market news I would, of course, 
have an exceptional source of information in Freiligrath. 
Ad vocem 'Presse': I accept this offer, too: Firstly, because, unlike 
last time, no conditions are imposed on me as regards the 
treatment of specific political personalities. I make it an absolute 
principle never to assent to a condition. On the other hand, every 
newspaper has a right to expect tact of its correspondents. 
Secondly, because times have changed and I now consider it 
essential that our party should secure positions wherever possible, 
even if only for a time, so that others should not gain possession 
of the terrain. For the time being, of course, it must be used 
cautiously, but the most important thing is to acquire influence at 
various points against more crucial contingencies. I. never received 
the copies of the Presse which you say Friedländer sent me, 
probably because they were wrongly addressed. I ought, by the by, 
to be sent a few numbers immediately; one has to find out from 
the actual paper how, not what, one should write for the Viennese 
public. 
Ad vocem your writing for the 'Presse'. I am quite convinced you 
should write for them. True, it would be 'improper' for you, as a 
Prussian, to write for an Austrian paper just now. But on principle 
we should, as Luther says of God, 'use a thief to catch a  thief', 3 
and whenever we get the chance, contribute to the general state of 
disintegration and confusion. Before the start of the present 
troubles I would neither have written for the Presse  myself,  nor 
have advised you to do so. But the fermentation process has 
begun and now it's up to everyone to do what he can. It is now 
advisable to infiltrate poison, no matter where. Should we confine 
ourselves to writing for papers which on the whole share our 
viewpoint, we'd have to postpone all journalistic activity indefinite­
ly. And should one really allow so-called 'PUBLIC OPINION' to have 
nothing but counter-revolutionary stuff pumped into it? 
Ad vocem 'Tribune': You certainly misunderstood me if you 
thought I was asking you to take the Tribunes subscribers into 
account. The fact of the matter is this: My real business with the 
Tribune consists in writing leaders about anything I choose. Here, 
England heads the bill and France comes second. Much is of an 
11 M. Luther, Von Kauffshandlung und Wucher.

economic nature. But since the change of course in Prussia, 336 I 
have amused myself on the sly by writing an occasional report 
from 'Berlin' and owing to my 'internal' ties with the Hohenzollern 
homeland I have been able to assess conditions there with great 
assurance. Among the said subscribers to the Tribune there are a 
great many Germans. Moreover, the German-American newspa­
pers,  whose name is legion, reprint stuff from it. This being so, it 
was important for me to give local colour to the occasional article I 
wrote from 'Berlin' in order that my polemic with the Prussian 
State might also be pursued in the New World. A little gossip is 
indispensable to local colour of this kind. Besides, present Prussian 
history consists largely of chronique scandaleuse. Hinc illae lacrimae? 
In this respect your last letter served me to good purpose.

the Indian Mutiny.178  A GENERAL  financial  BREAKDOWN  seems inevitable 
unless those classes  are  taxed which  to date have been England's 
most solid supporters. However, even that will  be of no  substantial 
help.  The  joke  is that John Bull will  now  have  to pay out  annually 
between  4 and 5  million cash  in India  in order  to keep  the  wheels 
turning,  and  will  in this nice roundabout  way  restore  his  national 
debt  to the  proper progressive  RATIO.  It must certainly  be admitted 
that the  Indian market  is being paid  a damned high price  for 
Manchester  COTTONS.  According  to the  report  of the  Military 
Commission 80,000  EUROPEANS  as well  as some 200,000  to 260,000 
NATIVES  will have  to be  maintained  in India  for  years  to come. This 
costs  ABOUT  £20 million and the total  NET  REVENUE  amounts to no 
more than  £25  million. Moreover,  the  mutiny  has  added  a 
PERMANENT DEBT  of £50 million or, according to Wilson's calculations, 
a permanent annual deficit  of 3  million.  In addition, there  is the 
GUARANTEE  of £2 million per annum to the  RAILWAYS  until they are 
running  and,  indefinitely,  a smaller  sum if  their  NET REVENUE  falls 
short  of 5%. So far  (apart from  the  short stretch  of railway that 
has been completed) India  has got  nothing  out of the  thing save 
the privilege  of paying English capitalists .">%  for their capital.  But 
John Bull  has  cheated himself,  or  rather  has  been cheated  by his 
capitalists. India's payments  are  merely nominal, whereas those  of 
John Bull  are  real.  E.g. a  substantial part  of Stanley's  LOAN399  was 
simply  to be  used  for  paying  5% to  English capitalists, even  in 
respect  of  railways  the  building  of  which  has not yet  begun. 
Finally,  the  revenue from opium, amounting hitherto  to £4 
million  per  annum,  is under serious threat  as a  result  of the 
Chinese treaty.400 Whatever happens  the  monopoly  is bound  to 
collapse  and in  China itself  the  cultivation  of opium will soon  be in 
full swing. Revenue  was  derived from opium precisely because  it 
was an  article  of contraband.  To my  mind  the  present financial 
catastrophe  in India  is a  more serious affair than  was the war in 
India.

'Engels' pamphlet came out 3 days ago. Today I am sending him two copies by 
book post, as I shall do each day for 6 days in succession. For this is the only way 
we could devise' (!) 'of avoiding heavy postal charges on the one hand and, on the 
other, preventing certain persons from guessing who was the pamphlet's author. Write and 
tell him this.' 3 
Have you ever known such tomfoolery? To distract attention 
from you, they send you copies by book post '6 days in 
succession'! 
Of the thing itself Lassalle writes: 
'The pamphlet is truly impressive by reason of the pungency and sterling 
quality of the strategic knowledge evinced therein.' 
(The 'pungency' of 'knowledge' may be regarded as a lapsus 
pennae}') 
As to my own affair,' Lassalle writes: 
'Duncker tells me that the instalments will be ready by mid-May.' 
(So that's another month's delay.) 
'He maintains he is getting on with the printing as quickly as he can. At any rate 
you are utterly wrong in supposing that he is deliberately dragging his feet. He's 
always rather slow.' 
What I do know, however, is that another 10 days have gone by 
without my getting a proof-sheet. 
Apropos. The Neue Zeit is on its last legs. Mr Edgar, who 
actually ended up by gracing its columns with a short story of his 
own contriving,* resigned a week ago—realising that the world 
was thoroughly unamenable to his genius. Last Saturday 6 it came 
out as a half number, and this week will probably see the end of it. 
The Hermann, too, according to current rumour, will soon depart 
this life. A good thing the curs snatched so eagerly at the 
opportunity of thus shamelessly laying bare their nonentity before 
all the world. Kinkel has KILLED the Kinkel humbug with his own 
hand. The CLOWN,' for his part, has found out just how 'easy' it is 
to take our place in communist literature.

London, 16 April [1859] 
Dear Engels, 
I trust that by the time you get this note your toothache will 
have gone. It's a fiendish thing. 
MEANWHILE I have made arrangements which, within a short time, 
will double my income and thus put an end to the habitual misery. 
Friedländer, Lassalle's cousin (sometime editor along with Eisner 
and Co. of the Neue Oder-Zeitung), present editor of the Presse in 
Vienna (which, en passant, has 24,000 subscribers), offered, in 
January 1858, to appoint me correspondent to his paper. 254 I 
turned this down at the time because he stipulated that only 
Bonaparte, not Palmerston, be attacked. Now he has renewed the 
offer,  ALL CONDITIONS LAID  AsiDF.  Since,  however,  this  will  as a  rule 
involve only 1 article (20 frs) per week, it is comparatively 
unimportant. But I am at the same time to be their despatcher of 
telegrams (in French), 10 frs per telegram, and this, though 
time-consuming, is lucrative. 
The only point that remains to be settled is that of instructions 
to a banking house in London, since telegraphing necessitates 
considerable expenditure. Negotiations—before the terms were 
SETTLED—extended  over 3 weeks. It was only yesterday that I sent a 
definite answer to a letter received the same day from Vienna. So 
it will be 8-10 days before the thing gets under way.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 403 
IN BERLIN 
London, 19 April 1859 
Dear Lassalle, 
I sent no separate acknowledgment of the £14 10/- because the 
letter was registered. But I should have written earlier had I not 
been plagued by a damned 'cousin from Holland',0 who laid claim 
to my surplus working time in THE MOST CRUEL MANNER. 
HE IS NOW  GONE,  and so I can breathe again. 
Friedländer has written to me. d The terms are not as favourable 
as those originally communicated to you, but are nonetheless 
•RESPECTABLE.254 Once a few subsidiary points have been settled 
between us—which will, I think, be done in the course of this 
week—I shall write to him. 
Here in England the class struggle is progressing in a most 
gratifying way. Unfortunately there is no longer any Chartist 
paper in existence and hence I had to give up literary 
collaboration with that movement ABOUT two years ago. 
Now I come to Franz von Sickingen. D'abord,' I must applaud 
a K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. - b As to - c  Johann Carl 
Juta - d See this volume, p. 416. - e First

both composition and action, and that's more than one can say of 
any other modern German play. IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, and aside 
from any reactions of a purely critical nature, the work excited me 
very much at the first reading and hence will induce this reaction 
to an even greater degree in more emotionally inclined readers. 
And that is another and very important aspect. 
Now for THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MEDAL: Firstly—and this is purely a 
question of form—since you have chosen to write in verse, you 
could have put a touch more artistry into the iambics. However, 
though your neglecting to do so might well shock a professional 
poet, I regard it by and large as a merit, our breed of poetical 
epigones having retained nothing but formal polish. Secondly, the 
implicit conflict is not just tragic; it is the tragic conflict upon 
which the revolutionary party of 1848-49 justly foundered. Hence 
making it the fulcrum of a modern tragedy can only meet with my 
wholehearted approval. But then, I ask  myself,  is the theme in 
question suitable for the portrayal of that conflict? Balthasar may 
indeed imagine that had Sickingen not pretended that his 
rebellion was a knightly feud, but had instead raised the standard 
of opposition to the emperor and open war against the princes, he 
would have won. But are we able to share that illusion? Sickingen 
(and with him Hütten, more or less) went under, not because of 
his cunning, but because, as a knight and as representative of a 
declining  class,  he rebelled against existing reality, or rather against 
the new form of existing reality. Strip Sickingen of the appurte­
nances of the individual and his particular education, natural 
disposition, etc., and you have— Götz von Berlichingen. In this 
latter, miserable fellow the tragic opposition between knights on 
the one hand and emperor and princes on the other is adequately 
personified and that is why Goethe rightly made him his hero. 2 In 
so far as Sickingen—and even Hütten up to a point, although in 
his case, as in that of all ideologists of a class, such assertions call 
for substantial modification—is fighting the princes (he turns 
against the emperor b only because the emperor of knights has 
become the emperor of princes), he is, in fact, nothing more than 
a Don Quixote, if with some historical justification. The fact that 
he begins his rebellion in the guise of a knightly feud merely 
means that he begins it in knightly fashion. Were he to begin it in 
any other way, he would have to appeal directly and at the very 
outset to the towns and the peasants, i.e. the very classes whose 
development=the negation of knighthood.

Unless, therefore, you wished to reduce the conflict to no more 
than what is portrayed in Götz von Berlichingen—and such was 
not your plan—Sickingen and Hütten were bound to go under 
because they imagined themselves to be revolutionaries (which 
cannot be said of Götz) and, just like the cultivated Polish 
aristocracy of 1830, turned themselves on the one hand into the 
organs of modern ideas while on the other actually representing a 
reactionary class interest. 404 The aristocratic representatives of 
revolution—behind whose catch-words of unity and liberty there 
still lingers the dream of the imperial past and of club-law—ought 
not in that case to monopolise the interest as you make them do; 
rather the representatives of the peasants (of these in particular) 
and of the revolutionary elements in the towns should provide an 
altogether significant and dynamic background. This would have 
enabled you to give expression in far greater measure precisely to 
the most modern ideas in their most unsophisticated form; 
whereas, in fact now, the dominant idea, apart from religious 
freedom, is civic unity. Then you would automatically have had to 
'Shakespearise' more, whereas your principal failing is, to my mind, 
'Schillering', i.e. using individuals as mere mouthpieces for the 
spirit of the times. Have not you yourself—like your Franz von 
Sickingen—succumbed, to some extent, to the diplomatic error of 
regarding the Lutheran-knightly opposition as superior to the 
plebeian-Münzerian? 
Again, I miss what is characteristic in the characters. I except 
Charles V, Balthasar and Richard of Trier. And was there ever a 
time of more robust character traits than the 16th century? To 
my mind Hütten is, to far too great a degree, merely a represen­
tative of 'enthusiasm', which is boring. Wasn't he also witty, 
an infernal wit, and hence hasn't he been done a grave 
injustice? 
The extent to which even your Sickingen—who, by the way, is 
portrayed much too abstractly—suffers as a result of a conflict 
that is quite independent of all his personal calculations is evident 
from the necessity he is in of urging friendship with the towns, 
etc., upon his knights and, on the other hand, from the 
satisfaction with which he himself imposes club-law upon those 
same towns. 
To come down to details, I would censure the sometimes 
excessive preoccupation of individuals with themselves—the result 
of your predilection for Schiller. E.g. on p. 121, when Hütten is 
telling Marie the history of his life, it would have been quite 
natural to make Marie say: 

=====第455页=====
240. Marx to Lassalle. 19 April 1859 421 
'The whole gamut of sensations', 
etc., up to the words, 
'And weighs more heavily on me than did the years'. 
The preceding verses, from 'They say' to 'grown older', might 
follow at this point, but the comment, 'The virgin in a single night 
matures into a woman' (although showing that the love Marie 
knows is more than a mere abstraction), is completely pointless; 
still less should Marie have begun by reflecting upon her own 
'ageing'. After recounting all that she had said during the 'one' 
hour, she might have given general expression to her feelings in 
the phrase about her "ageing'. Again, what offends me in the lines 
that follow is: 'I thought it was my right' (i.e. happiness). Why give 
the lie to the ingenuous view of the world which Marie has 
hitherto professed to hold, by turning it into a doctrine of rights? 
Maybe some other time I shall give you my opinion in greater 
detail. 
I consider the scene between Sickingen and Charles V to be 
particularly felicitous, although the dialogue on both sides 
is rather too much in the nature of pleading; also the 
scenes in Trier. Hutten's lines about the sword I thought very 
fine. 
Well, that's enough for this time. 
You have made my wife into a special admirer of your play. 
Only Marie doesn't satisfy her. 
Salut.

ENGELS TO ELISABETH ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
Manchester, 20 April 1859 
Dear Mother, 
At last a modicum of peace and quiet in which to write to you 
again. I got both your dear letters and am glad to hear that you 
are all well and that the Blank children have recovered from the 
measles. I am very well; my back teeth are gradually breaking up, 
but not too painfully on the whole, otherwise there's absolutely 
nothing wrong with me; my appetite and digestion are first-rate 
and there hasn't been a trace of the old troubles. 
So little Delius has finally been unable after all to help coming 
the Bradfordian over you. I should have thought he would mind 
his p's and q's a bit more, but since he has evidently begun to stir 
up these little troubles, I can only tell you that in Bradford talking 
big is in the very air, and that, in the long run, it's a sheer 
impossibility for a Bradfordian to tell the truth. Now that the little 
chap shares lodgings with Wilhelm Kutter, who is the greatest tall 
story teller under the sun, he seems increasingly to be acquiring 
the same virtue. If a Bradfordian were to tell me that twice two 
makes four, I would immediately begin to doubt the accuracy of 
the multiplication table. I'm warning you of this in advance, so 
that you're not too hard on the little chap; Bradfordians are all 
alike, they're fluent liars. The story about the horse originated 
simply from my having told the owner that, if he would sell the 
animal for less than £120, he was to let me know—nothing more. 
It's a long way from there to buying. Were it now to be offered 
me at £120, I would think twice before giving £100 for it, since it 
is in fact rather too light for me and for the same money I could 
get a very fine, strong hunter. Come to that, it's not such a tall 
story about his bolting into a shop. Any horse that's really 
mettlesome and has done little or nothing for a whole week will, 
with an indifferent rider, engage in all manner of strange antics, 
and whether the pair of them break their necks is entirely a 
matter of luck. But no horse is going to find it easy to take me 
into a shop against my will, you may be sure of that. 
The other story, the one about Carl Siebel, is still more of a 
fabrication. Far from leading a dissipated life, he spends nearly 
every evening at home, hardly ever goes out and has hardly any 

=====第457页=====
241. Engels to Elisabeth Engels. 20 April 1859 423 
acquaintances. I don't believe there are twenty young men of his 
age in the whole of Manchester who live as soberly as he does. 
True,  in the early days he did once or twice drink a glass too 
many, and indulged in all kinds of childish pranks but, being in 
the company of myself and a few acquaintances and seeing that we 
found nothing to admire in these puerilities, he gave it up. 
Altogether he's still half a child, terribly immature and incapable 
of coping with the most everyday problems. But time will take care 
of that. We Barmen lads all seem to have this in common—that it 
takes us a long time to emerge from uncouth adolescence; I must 
have been just as queer a fish when I was 23. His parents, by the 
way, must have gone about it very oddly if they could do nothing 
with the lad, for he has an excellent side to him, namely awareness 
of his own weaknesses, and, far from being self-willed, is on the 
contrary very amenable to persuasion. What prepossesses me in 
his favour is that, despite all the fulsome praise that has been 
lavished on his verses, he knows at the bottom of his heart that 
these are nothing but immature, unfinished, superficial affairs, 
and the nice young chap was awfully grateful to me when I 
explained this to him good-humouredly but no less clearly for 
that; for after he had presented me with the whole of his 
immortal works, I told him outright that, while they showed talent, 
it was wasted talent, and that none of his stuff was of any value as 
a work of art. The lad must really have been very much of a 
dilettante in Berlin, and in danger of going to the dogs among the 
belletristic riff-raff of the literary world there. Whenever I see 
him, I regularly take him to task on the subject and tell him he 
should turn his back on versifying for a time and make a 
thorough study of the classical poets of all nations in order to 
educate his very confused taste a little, and to learn German, of 
which he still knows nothing. If he does this, he may yet become a 
very steady sort of chap. His parents, by the way, ought to have 
sufficient gumption to place themselves on a rational footing with 
him—one that he can tolerate—or so arrange matters that he can 
gradually find the means and the opportunity of setting himself 
up, here or elsewhere, as an independent business man. The boy 
knows that he can at any time earn sufficient to live on by his 
writing, and if his dear papa has neither the intelligence nor the 
tact to treat him like a grown-up person, he has only himself to 
blame if the chap finally gets sick of the whole thing and decides 
to do nothing but write, when he would quite certainly go 
completely to the dogs. Old Siebel may perhaps imagine that I'm 
putting all kinds of nonsense into his son's head, but he can rest 
15**

424 241. Engels to Elisabeth Engels. 20 April 1859 
assured that I am bringing my whole influence to bear on him to 
deter him from over-much writing (because the boy isn't yet ripe 
for it) and to make him realise that there's no more wretched 
existence than dependence on earnings from literary work, and 
that the sooner he comes to terms with his prosaic, bourgeois 
trade, the better (for without it, since he is au fond"  reluctant to 
learn, there would be nothing to restrain him and he'd go to the 
dogs altogether). If he does this and gains a little more experience 
of life and sheds his awkwardness, I have no doubt he will become 
a very steady sort of chap and achieve something worthwhile in 
the literary field too. I like the boy very much since he is 
exceedingly good-natured, not at all conceited and very frank and 
straightforward. I normally see him twice a week or so. 
I didn't know that E. Blank was in London and hope that he'll 
come up here one of these days; anyhow, a few months ago he 
promised he would. War or no war, by the way, let nothing 
prevent you from coming over here this summer—I'm counting 
firmly on it. As you know, we're bound for Scotland this summer, 
and in the meantime you can take another look at your Walter 
Scott so that you'll know what's what. 
But now I must stop as it's 7 o'clock and I still have sundry 
business letters to write. I had really meant to enclose a note for 
Father, but it is absolutely impossible and I must have the 
statements done for him as well. So I'll write to him as soon as I 
can, in two or three days' time. 
Meanwhile give him my love, and also to my brothers and sisters 
and their families. 
With much love from your son, 
Friedrich 
You needn't, of course, tell Mrs Siebel every word I've said 
about Carl. 
From the bottom of my heart I wish you many happy returns of 
the day, and hope that I shall be able to do so many, many times 
again.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 22 April 1859 
Dear Frederick, 
I have MODIFIED your ARTICLE3 to accord with the latest NEWS. 
You didn't, I suppose, waste your time (as I was obliged to do) 
wading through last Monday's parliamentary debates.1" Their CIST 
was as follows: 
1. England has been duped throughout the negotiations. 
2. England is decidedly pro-Austrian. 
ad 1. The English ministers had announced once before that 
everything was SETTLED. This was when the news of the evacuation 
of Rome °5 was appearing in all the papers. From statements 
made in the House of Lords it follows: that the Popec really had 
requested that his territory be evacuated. France had repeatedly 
complained to the English about the falsity of her position in 
Rome. She had wished to withdraw but was prevented, on the one 
hand, by the Pope's apprehensions and, on the other, by the 
Austrians' refusal similarly to withdraw. This was actually the 
official PRETEXT Boustrapa40 gave England to justify the scene with 
the Austrian ambassador on 1 January.406 WELL, the Pope scotched 
that PRETEXT. Austria ACTUALLY withdrew 2 battalions from Bologna 
and had given ORDERS for the remaining troops to leave. Then 
Bonaparte discovered a pretext for not evacuating, and thus the 
whole business fell through. This put Mr Derby into a very  BAD 
TEMPER and, TO SOOTH HIM, Bonaparte unbosomed himself about the 
'ITALIAN QUESTION' to Lord Cowley, who telegraphed London saying 
he found his demands 'SATISFACTORY'. Thereupon Cowley was sent to 
Vienna bearing Bonaparte's demands which England had ac­
cepted. (This man Cowley is the selfsame swine who, in Vienna in 
1848/49, intrigued against the German revolution.) This was at the 
end of February. Austria, being exceedingly reluctant to engage in 
a war and having at the time not progressed nearly so far in the 
matter of armaments as by the middle of March, accepted 
a 'The State of the Question.—Germany Arming' - lj An account of the debates in 
the British Parliament on 18 April 1859 was published in The Times, No. 23284, 
19 April 1859. - ' Pius IX 

=====第460页=====
426 242. Marx  to Engels.  22 April  1859 
everything. When Cowley arrived  in London  on his way  back  to 
Paris,  both  'he' and the  'Ministry',  as Derby himself says, were fully 
convinced that everything  was  SETTLED,  and  again discredited 
themselves  by making  a fresh statement  to that effect before 
Parliament.  So Cowley departs  in sanguine mood  for  Paris. Here 
he learns that they've been playing blind man's buff with  him and 
that, at Russia's suggestion, Boustrapa  has  agreed  to A  GENERAL 
CONGRESS  at which, again  at Russia's suggestion, only  the 5  great 
powers were  to be  represented,  i.e.  Sardinia  was to be  excluded. 
Derby declared outright that Russia's intervention (although agreed 
with France;  but  Bonaparte,  of course, could  not  reject CONDITIONS 
put to Austria  by England  in his  name)  was  alone  to blame  for the 
fact that peace  had not  been achieved.  On the  same  day 
Palmerston said  in the  House  OF  COMMONS that  he  didn't  (OF 
COURSE) blame Russia;  had  England's mediation been successful 
Russia would  not  have played  the  role  she  would certainly play  at 
a congress  and  which  was her due  where European questions were 
concerned. Although with very  bad  grace, Derby accepted  the 
Russian proposal under certain conditions,  of which THE PRINCIPAL 
was that  the  TERRITORIAL SETTLEMENTS  of the  Treaty  of Vienna  of 
1815407  should  not be  infringed. Austria,  who had  already 
assumed that everything  was  settled,  now  clearly perceived that 
war had  been decided upon  and  that  an attempt  was  being made  to 
lead her by the  nose. Hence  her  reply  to the new  English proposal 
was the  outrageous demand that,  by way of a  preliminary  to the 
congress, Sardinia must disarm. Whereupon Derby proposed  to 
Bonaparte that Sardinia should  be  induced  to consent  to this 
outrage  on condition that both France  and  England simultaneous­
ly undertook  to guarantee  her  against  a breach  of the  peace  by 
Austria during  the  congress. That  ass  Bonaparte rejected this. 
Had he accepted  he could have  got his  agents  to stage some sort 
of fracas  on the  Austro-Piedmontese border, when England would 
have been BOUND DOWN TO AN OFFENSIVE TREATY WITH FRANCE AND SARDINIA 
AGAINST AUSTRIA,  and  Palmerston would have certainly compelled 
the Tories  TO BE  AS GOOD  AS THEIR WORD.  The Austrians, for their part, 
were alarmed  by the  ease with which, under certain circumstances, 
England  was  prepared  to enter into  an offensive alliance against 
them. They therefore promptly declared themselves  in favour  of 
the English proposal,  and  made Sardinia's disarmament  a general 
disarmament. Then came  the row as to  whether disarmament 
should take place before  the  MEETING  of the  CONGRESS,  as maintained 
by Austria,  or after  it, as  maintained  by Bonaparte,  and  then  as to 
whether  or not  Sardinia should  be admitted,  etc. In  short,  all the 

=====第461页=====
242. Marx  to Engels.  22 April  1859  427 
new difficulties stemmed from Bonaparte,  1) the  QUIBBLES  about 
disarmament;  2) after  all,  he and  Russia  had  proposed  the  exclusion 
of Sardinia from  the  congress.  So  enraged  was  Derby last Monday 
that he is  said  to  have literally shouted when  he  declared that 
England would  now  make  one  more,  ULTIMATE  proposal;  but  he was 
weary  of  TRIFLING  and if  that  one  failed  he  would  no  longer  act as 
mediator,  etc. 
ad 2.  Bonaparte could accept these latter proposals since they 
were detrimental solely  to Austria  in so far as  she was  in the  lead 
with  her  armaments.  He had to  accept them  if Derby  was not  to be 
given  a pretext  for  taking  an  outright stand against  him.  Austria 
had to  reject them  if she was not to  deprive herself  of  every 
advantage,  etc.  Bonaparte,  who  had  counted  on  Derby's fall  and 
Palmerston's accession,  was  IN A  PLIGHT  THE  WORSE  since  in  their 
speeches Derby  and  Disraeli  had  plainly indicated that they were 
tired  of being duped  by  Bonaparte  and  Russia  and had,  moreover, 
definitely sided with Austria. Malmesbury said  he  failed  to 
understand upon what pretext Bonaparte  had  intervened  in the 
Italian imbroglio. Derby said that England would  at first observe 
ARMED NEUTRALITY,  but  turn against  any  power which  'for no  good 
reason' instigated  a war.  Derby said that England's interests  in the 
Adriatic  did  not  permit  him  to look  on  with folded arms;  and  that 
he would regard  an  attack  on  Trieste almost  as a  casus belli. 
Disraeli said that Austria  had  behaved with  DIGNIFIED MODERATION'  and 
that Sardinia  was  AMBIGUOUS, VEXING AND EVEN AMBITIOUS-.  Finally they  all 
said that  the  treaties  of 1815  must  be  MAINTAINED,  and  repeatedly 
emphasised, with immediate reference  to the  TERRITORIAL SETTLEMENT 
IN ITALY,  that those treaties  INTENDED  PUTTING  A CHECK  UPON  THE 
ENCROACHING AMBITION  OF  FRANCE'. 
This much  is  certain:  The  ruse whereby Derby, instead  of 
resigning, consigned Parliament  to the  devil, thus temporarily 
banishing Palmerston into private life,  has  placed  the  Russo-
French game  in a  serious dilemma. 
There  are  only  two  alternatives. 
Either Austria allows herself  to be  intimidated  by  minatory 
TELEGRAMS  from London  and  Berlin,  and  WITHDRAWS  Gyulay's 
ultimatum  to Piedmont,408  in which case  not  even  God  will be able 
to help Bonaparte.  For  then  he  will, IN  FACT,  be  compelled  to 
disarm  and be  treated  by the  army  as a  Soulouque.  As it is, the 
workers  in  Paris have been infuriated  by the  turpitude  of 
Blanqui's deportation  to  Cayenne.409  Or  else Austria wearies  of 
diplomatic trifling  and  marches  on  Turin.  In  which case  Mr 
Bonaparte  has won  a diplomatic victory  in as  much  as Austria will

have been  the  first  to declare  war; but  that diplomatic victory will 
have been bought at the expense of  AN  UGLY MILITARY DEFEAT.  In which 
case I don't give 4  MONTHS PURCHASE  FOR HIS  CROWN  AND  DYNASTY. 
I'll send  you the  Tribunes tomorrow. 
Apropos. 
The great imperial Vogt 410 has  written Freiligrath  an  epistle  in 
which  he  informs  him  that this imperial gang  is bringing  out a 
new newspaper  in Zurich  (or  Berne,  I forget which). 4" He  invited 
Freiligrath  to write  for the  feuilleton  and to  enlist  the  profound 
Bûcher  as political correspondent. 
The platform upon which imperial Vogt proposes  to build  a 
new 'party'  and  which  has, as he  himself puts  it, been most warmly 
welcomed  by A.  Herzen,  is this: Germany surrenders  her  extrater­
ritorial possessions. Does  not  support Austria. French despotism  is 
transitory, Austrian permanent. Both despots  to be  allowed  to 
bleed  to  death. (Even some predilection  for  Bonaparte  in 
evidence.) Armed neutrality  for  Germany.  A revolutionary move­
ment  in Germany,  as Vogt 'knows  on the  best authority',  is not to 
be thought of  DURING  OUR  LIFETIME. CONSEQUENTLY,  as soon as Austria 
has been ruined  by  Bonaparte,  the  fatherland will experience  the 
spontaneous beginnings  of a  moderate, liberal-national develop­
ment  à la imperial Regency,  and  Vogt  may yet  become Prussian 
court jester. From Vogt's letter  it is  evident that  he  believes 
Freiligrath  to be no  longer connected with  us in any way. The 
ignorance  of this imperial Vogt about  the  people  he is  dealing 
with! Bûcher,  as an Urquhartite,  is an  Austrian.  The  great Blind, 
ON THE  OTHER HAND,  finding himself in the dil emma of being 
anti-Bonaparte  as a  German  and  anti-Austria asVRotteck,  is AT THE 
PRESENT MOMENT  convening a 'German Parliament', 3 as the telegraph 
will soon announce  in Manchester.412

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 82 
IN BERLIN 
London, 5 May 1859 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Lassalle, 
From the enclosed letter dated April 12,a  which I should like to 
have back, you will see that there is a very considerable difference 
between the terms offered me by your cousin Friedländer and the 
terms you originally communicated to me. b Nevertheless I replied 
by return accepting them.413 I merely noted: 
1. that I could not make disbursements for telegrams, a point, 
by the by, that hardly needed mentioning and had been 
anticipated in your letter; 
2. that, if we came to an arrangement, I should like (though I 
did not make it a conditio sine qua') to be able to draw on them 
with a BANKER here for articles, etc., sent, as is done in the case of 
the Tribune. 
So far there has been no answer, which I find strange. If the 
editors have changed their minds, they might have had the 
decency to inform me. As you are aware, I did not in any way 
thrust myself forward in this matter. But, having accepted, I made 
one or two preliminary approaches to English newspapers, etc.,

MARX TO ENGELS 20 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 6 May 1859 
DEAR  Frederick, 
Your article received.414 You will have seen from a telegraphic 
despatch that Hess has come out against Gyulay's plan (perhaps 
one should describe it as  absence  of plan). Looked at from our—i.e. 
a revolutionary—POINT  OF VIEW,  it would be by no means undesirable 
if Austria were to begin either by suffering a reverse or, which is 
morally the same thing, by withdrawing into Lombardy again. 
This will greatly complicate matters and thus allow sufficient time 
for things to come to a head in Paris. All in all the state of affairs 
is such that, no matter on what side BLUNDERS occur, they will 
necessarily redound to our advantage. If, at the outset, Austria 
were to beat the Piedmontese army, take Turin and thrash the 
French as they debouched from the Alps, Russia might immediate­
ly turn against Bonaparte415—having in any case not yet actually 
entered into any obligations against Germany, and our rotten 
Prussian government would be extricated from the only dilemma 
that might cost it its neck. Again: Such a devastating defeat at the 
very beginning could bring about a mutiny in the French army 
and an anti-Bonaparte revolution in Paris. What then? At this 
juncture the upshot would be victorious armed intervention by the 
Holy Alliance lfi  against a potential revolutionary government in 
Paris,  something which certainly doesn't come into our calcul 3 
a calculations

Even Radetzky had the revolutionary ardour of 1848 in his veins. 
On the other hand I believe that on both sides, Austrian and 
French, the war will now be conducted with reactionary medioc­
rity. 
It was wrong of you not to have sent us at least two more 
pamphlets a —for Pfänder, who sent off your manuscript under his 
own name, and for Freiligrath. It would also be fitting to send a 
copy to P. Imandt (DUNDEE SEMINARY, Dundee). You must pay some 
heed to party relations and keep the chaps in good humour. 
Apropos, I deleted the whole of the preamble to your last 
Friday's article,b firstly because I had my MISGIVINGS about the 
Austrians; secondly because it is absolutely essential that we do not 
identify our cause with that of the present German governments. 
In my view, the worthy Palmerston will very shortly be back at 
the helm as FOREIGN MINISTER or War Minister. Those dolts of 
Tories are indeed making things too easy for him. First they go 
and spoil the Austrians' game by their miserable  SHOW  OF MEDIATION. 
Then, as soon as the Franco-Russian treaty has been made known, 
they bend every FORCE to deny its existence, so as to prove  THAT  THEY 
HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE. This in turn gives The Times the 
opportunity to deride them and adopt a patriotic attitude towards 
Russia.' But the LONG  AND  SHORT of it is that The Times, like all the 
rest of Palmerston's papers (though these, depending on their 
allotted role, either oppose or support the various powers 
involved), is hinting at the necessity of reappointing  THE  TRULY 
BRITISH MINISTER141 (The Morning Advertiser and The Daily Telegraph, 
which write for the  MOB,  are saying it openly). The wretched Tories 
ought instead to have 'lent credence to' the Russo-French treaty 
and seized on the chance of going for Pam. They had the best of 
OPPORTUNITIES. Firstly, Pam was in Compiegne3"' when the whole 
plan was hatched. Secondly, Mr Whiteside, speaking on behalf of 
the ministry, had in fact already told silly old John Bull'1 what had 
long been apparent from the Blue Books,38 namely that in 1848 
Austria approached Palmerston and offered to relinquish the whole 
of Lombardy but to install an Italian government in Venice under 
an Austrian ARCHDUKE, if he would mediate.c Piedmont had 
approached him at the same time, France ditto. What did Pam do?

He rejected the proposal, on the PRETEXT that Venice, too, must be 
given up altogether. He gave this answer after a three weeks' 
silence. As soon as Radetzky was victorious he called upon the 
Austrians to carry out the plan they had divulged to him. In the 
Hungarian affair (with reference this time to the CONDITIONS upon 
which the already desperate Hungarians were willing to submit) he 
performed the same manoeuvre. The fellow's return to the 
ministry constitutes A REM. DANGER. In Germany, by the by, the 
fellows are beginning to see through him. In a book by  Prof. 
Wurm of Hamburg (a history of the war in the East), 3 and a book 
on Nicholas by another German, whose name I can't recall, Pam is 
attacked outright as a Russian agent. 
Ad vocem BUSINESS.11  That ass Friedländer wrote to me on 12 April 
but had forgotten the crucial point, i.e. instructions to a 
banking-house. Instead, he spoke of an 'advance'. This last is 
NONSENSE. £8-10, and often £15, will be needed each week for 
telegrams. I wrote and told the ass so. Up till now no answer, 
although he regularly sends me the Vienna Presse (from which I 
gather that it now has 26,000 subscribers). Yesterday I wrote 
Lassalle a fulminating letter.' I see from,the Presse that Lassalle 
has embarked on his articles and telegraphic despatches for that 
paper with great zeal albeit small talent. However he did not 
accept this post until I had 'given him permission' in writing,' 1 not 
wanting—or so he says—to take the political risk without my 
CONSENT. It would be a rum business, would it not, if all the 
transaction led to was Lassalle's installing himself in that quarter? 
It's possible, however, that the delay is due to Friedländer's 
difficulty in arranging the financial side in Vienna during the 
present TROUBLES. MEANWHILE, out of impatience, I am devoting 
myself to algebra. 
Salut.

Dear Sir, 
I have been receiving the Vienna Presse regularly and my debt 
to you for sending it is the greater in that it throws light on 
conditions in Austria at this important juncture. 
I have not yet had a reply to the letter I wrote you some weeks 
ago.4ls  If, by chance, the proposed arrangement11  has come to 
nothing as a result of the DÉRANGEMENTS of the Vienna money 
market, 4'7 / would beg you to advise me of this by return, for I have 
made certain agreements regarding telegrams with newspapers 
over here which commit me to financial outlays and which I shall 
accordingly terminate forthwith. 
Yours very truly,

Dear Engels, 
From the enclosed letter of Lassalle's,418 which I must have back 
by return, you will see how far things have progressed with the 
a Marx's work for the Vienna newspaper Die Presse (see this volume, p. 432).

Vienna  BUSINESS.  I wrote  to Friedländer  at once.  The  fact  is that 
Lassalle doesn't know that  I get the  Presse every day—I enclose  a 
few excerpts from it—and thus have seen that,  up to the  time  of 
my letter, 3 he  regularly contributed  to the  paper,  but  that  the 
latter stopped  his  telegrams from Berlin  on  account  of  their 
inordinate length; moreover  his  articles were inept  and  would  be 
something  of an  embarrassment  to any  paper.  It is  possible that 
the whole business  is off, but it is  also possible that  the  COMMERCIAL 
PANIC  in Vienna, comparable only  to the one in  Hamburg,41  has so 
far prevented the chaps from making any  ARRANGEMENT.  NOUS

MARX  TO  ENGELS' 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  18 May 1859 
Dear Engels, 
Lassalle's letter418  contains several  POINTS  upon which  I shall haul 
him over  the  coals. D'abord?  the laddie talks about what  he 'is to 
do for me'. But all I  asked  of him was  that  he, who set the  whole 
thing  in train  and  whose articles  I was  constantly seeing  in the 
Presse, should enlighten  me as to the  mysterious silence from 
Vienna.' This  was his  BUSINESS.  Secondly,  he  makes  it look  as

though he had contributed to the Presse only after a tremendous 
struggle, on 'my' insistence. But at one point in the same letter he 
admits that he had already begun sending articles to Vienna before 
I had stated my case. Then, however, he proceeds to reverse the 
'nexus'.  When he sent me Friedländer's offer he drivelled away for 
two pages about whether or not he should write to Vienna, and 
made the thing dependent on my decision. D'abord, it went 
without saying that, if I thought writing for the Presse good 
enough for me, I wouldn't think it beneath Lassalle. Moreover, I 
could see from his letter how anxious he was to obtain my CONSENT. 
Why then do we now have this self-aggrandizing misrepresenta­
tion of the causal nexus? What he says about 'bias' and having 
written to Friedländer 'telling him off about it, is NONSENSE. AS 
Austrian papers go and considering the circumstances, the Vienna 
Presse is edited cleverly and fairly, with far greater tact than 
Lassalle would be able to command. Finally, I did not invite the 
laddie's instructions as to what is or is not 'worthy' of me. I 
consider it RATHER ARROGANT of him to drop hints to me on the 
subject. If Friedländer manages to SETTLE the financial side, I shall 
positivement stand by my decision, which is in no way altered by 
the fact that Lassalle's articles don't seem to suit Friedländer. From 
recent issues of the Presse I see that the number of its subscribers 
has risen to 27,000. 
Lassalle's pamphlet" is an ENORMOUS BLUNDER.421  The publication of 
your 'anonymous' pamphlet made him envious. Admittedly the 
position of the revolutionary party in Germany is difficult at 
present, yet a little critical analysis of the CIRCUMSTANCES suffices to 
make it plain. As regards the 'governments', it is clear from all 
points of view, if only in the interests of Germany's existence, that 
they must be urged not to remain neutral but to be, as you rightly 
say, patriotic. But the affair can be given revolutionary pertinence 
simply by stressing opposition to Russia more strongly than 
opposition to Boustrapa. ° That's what Lassalle should have done 
vis-à-vis the Neue  Preussische  Zeitungs anti-French clamour. Indeed, 
il is this point which, as the war goes on, will in practice involve the 
German governments in high treason and at which it will be possible 
lo seize them by the throat. Incidentally, if Lassalle takes it upon 
himself to speak in the name of the party, he must in future either 
resign himself to being publicly disavowed by us, since circumstances 
are too grave to take account of feelings, or else he must first 
ascertain the views held by others besides himself before following

the joint inspiration of fire and logic.422 We must now absolutely 
insist on party discipline, otherwise everything will be in the soup. 
The confusion presently reigning in men's minds has reached a 
curious peak. D'abord, THERE IS that traitor to the Empire, the 
'imperial regent', 410 who has received cash payments from Paris.42 " 
In the Hamburg Freischütz, Mr Meyen praises Vogt's piece. 3 There 
is a type of vulgar democrat (some sincere ones among them 
believe that an Austrian defeat, complemented by revolution in 
Hungary+Galicia, etc., would bring about revolution in Germany. 
The dolts forget that revolution in Germany ncw=disorganisation 
of her armies and would benefit, not the revolutionaries, but 
Russia and Boustrapa), a type, I say, of vulgar democrat who de­
lights in being able to pipe the same tune as the decembristising'38 
Hungarians (Bangyas all) and Poles (in the Prussian chamber a 
few days ago Mr Cieszkowski called Nicholas the Poles' 'great Slav 
ally') and Italians. Another lot—e.g. Blind who seeks to combine 
patriotism and democratism — are making asses of themselves (and 
old Uhland too among their number) by demanding war with 
Austria against Bonaparte and, at the same time, an imperial 
parliament. D'abord, the asses fail to see that the conditions for the 
fulfilment of this repellent wish are entirely wanting. Secondly, 
however, they pay so little heed to what is really happening as to 
be wholly unaware that, in the only part of Germany which 
counts, namely Prussia, the bourgeois are proud of their Cham­
bers,  whose power is bound to grow with the growing embarrass­
ment of the GOVERNMENT; that these bourgeois are justifiably (as 
recent transactions in the Chambers go to show) disinclined to be 
dictated to by Badeners and Württembergers under the style of 
'parliament', just as the Prussian government is reluctant to be 
ruled by Austria under the style of 'Federal Diet' 423; that these 
bourgeois know from the experience of 1848 that a parliament 
alongside their Chambers destroys the power of the latter while 
itself remaining nothing more than a phantasm. In fact there is 
much more revolutionary purchase in the Prussian Chambers, 
which have to vote budgets and which, in certain EVENTUALITIES, 
have part of the ARMY and the Berlin mob behind them, than in a 
DEBATING CLUB under the style of 'Imperial Parliament'. That

view because  of their  own  importance goes without saying. There 
is a very real fear among  our own  party friends  and  other sincere 
revolutionaries that  war  against Boustrapa would mean  a reversion 
to 1813-15. Finally, those  who  speak  for the  Crédit mobilier 45 in 
Germany (Kölnische Zeitung, Fould-Oppenheim,  etc.)  naturally 
share  the  democrats' apprehensions  and pin  their hopes  on the 
Prussian dynasty's traditional short-sighted perfidy (Peace  of 
Basle, 424 etc.).  On the  other hand,  a section  of the  democratic  and 
revolutionary party feels bound  for  patriotic reasons  to adopt  a 
Jahn-Arndtian tone.  In view  of all  these CONFUSIONS,  and  since  I 
believe that Germany's fate  is hanging  in the  balance,  I think  it 
behoves  the two of us to  issue  a party manifesto.^  If the  Vienna 
business"  is settled,  you  must come  up for the  purpose  at Whitsun. 
If not, I  shall come  to Manchester. 
From these GENERAL THINGS  I NOW  come  to the  STATE  OF PARTIES 
(German)  in London,  and  here  I must recapitulate certain matters 
which  I considered  too  boring  to recount  to you so  long  as they 
were still  in progress. 
First,  you  will recall that  Mr  Liebknecht introduced  the  CLOWN 
E. Bauer into  the  so-called Communist Society 4"6 just when  I had 
publicly broken with Bauer  and  that  the  CLOWN took over  the  Neue 
Zeit in which  the  ignorant blockhead,  by his  EXAGGERATION  of the 
few communist catch-phrases  he had  picked  up  from Scherzer, 
turned  our  party into  a laughing-stock.  For me it was a  most 
disagreeable affair—not because  of the few  louts  in London,  but 
because  of the  malicious glee  of the  democratic crew, because  of 
the FALSE APPEARANCES  evoked by smartly sending  COPIES  of the filthy 
rag to Germany  and the  UNI LED SLATES,  because  of the  knowledge 
the CLOWN  gained  of the  rotten state  of the  party; finally, because 
of the  contacts  he made with  the  International Committee here. 427 
Throughout  the  time  the  CLOWN  was  editing  the  Neue Zeit  and 
lecturing  to the  Society,  Mr Liebknecht remained  in the  latter  and, 
moreover, talked  a great deal  of nonsense about having  to defend 
me against  the  great odium felt  for me by the  workers  (i.e.  louts), 
etc. Well, after only half  a number  (I sent  it to you) of the  Neue 
Zeit had appeared because  of lack  of money, Liebknecht acted  as 
CHAIRMAN  at a  meeting  to which  the  various associations  had  been 
invited  for the  purpose  of saving  the  paper. 428 The  result,  of 
course,  was nil.  After this performance,  I convened  our  people  (a 
small gang, Pfänder, Lochner,  etc., and a few  newcomers, whom

Liebknecht had for a long time—ever since my removal out of 
town 429—treated as his private club) and took the occasion to 
pitch into Liebknecht in a manner far from pleasing to him until 
he declared himself a contrite sinner. He said that an attempt had 
been made to bring out the Neue Zeit again, but had been 
frustrated by his vigorous intervention. I was therefore surprised 
to receive, a day or two later, what appeared to be a successor to 
the Neue Zeit, entitled Das Volk. 430 However, the matter was 
elucidated in a curious way, as follows (see also enclosed letter): 
Mr CLOWN had finally written to Biskamp (you have a letter to 
him from Biskamp) saying that Kinkel had ruined the Neue Zeit 
by his intrigues, appeared to be seething with vindictive feelings, 
etc. WEIL. Biskamp comes up to London and is d'abord STARTLED  BY 
THE FACT that one of his own articles intended for the Neue Zeit has 
appeared in the Hermann somewhat watered down. He hurries to 
the cipwN, who seems far from PLEASED to see him, says he is ill, 
simulates disillusionment and ends up by telling him that the 
whole thing is a mess, that he (Biskamp) should not get involved 
in it, that Kinkel is too strong, etc. But Biskamp, struck by the fact 
that Kinkel had transferred his Hermann to the Neue Zeit's press, 
having given up his former press, and that he was printing his 
manuscripts, hastily sought out Hirschfeld at the press where he 
discovered — Edgar Bauer's manuscript and proof corrections. IN 
ONE WORD, Mr Edgar had used the Neue Zeit to sell himself to Kinkel 
and—evidence of the man's fecundity—made the most of the 
occasion by printing Biskamp's manuscripts as contributions of his 
own.  That oaf Kinkel! He seeks to ruin the Neue Zeit, not by giving 
the CLOWN  money and allowing him to continue as editor, but by 
buying the said CLOWN who, throughout his editorship, had 
eschewed all polemic! But in this way Gottfried thought to rid 
himself once and for all of competition, however small. One more 
word about the activities of this same Gottfried. A third German 
paper made its appearance here, first under the title Londoner 
Deutsche Zeitung, then under the title Germania. This paper, edited 
by a certain Ermani, had Austrian leanings. Gottfried revealed 
that the editor had committed some felony, got Dr Juch to 
threaten him, bought up his paper and press for a mere song 
(whether out of the Revolutionary Fund or with money supplied 
by the Prussian Embassy isn't known) and, they say, intends to 
continue publishing the sheet under Juch's management and a 
different title. Kinkel's paper has 1,700 subscribers, is coming to 
be a source of income, and the fellow wishes to secure it against 
any competition or polemics. 

=====第473页=====
247. Marx to Engels. 18 May 1859 439 
After the CLOWN'S betrayal, Biskamp, etc., founded Das Volk, and 
he and the louts first approached me indirectly through Lieb­
knecht. Then Biskamp came to see me. 
I told him that we could not contribute directly to a small paper 
nor, for that matter, to any party paper which we did not ourselves 
edit However, the latter was a move for which every prerequisite 
was lacking at the moment. On the other hand Mr Liebknecht 
might give Biskamp the benefit of his collaboration. I appreciated, 
of course, that Gottfried has not been left in command of the field 
and that his dirty schemes should be BAFFLED, but all I would 
undertake to do was to let them have from time to time 
'published' Tribune ARTICLES which they could use; to urge my 
acquaintances to take the paper; and, finally, to give them verbally 
any information that reached me and 'pointers' about this and 
that. On the other hand I stipulated that Biskamp should 
forthwith publish (he will do so in the very next number) a 
documented account of Bauer's and Kinkel's dirty work. 3 (I shall 
thus have killed 2 birds with one stone, even if the little paper 
ceases publication.) Further, that the CLOWN'S objective heights must 
be abandoned and that the tone adopted must IN EVERY RESPECT be 
aggressive and polemical and, indeed, as amusing as possible. 
CONSEQUENTLY, I would ask you, Lupus, Gumpert and anyone else 
you can get hold of (point out that our only interest in the thing is 
that it's anti-Kinkel) to subscribe to Das Volk, OFFICE: 3 Litchfield 
Street, Soho. (Quarterly subscription 3/6d post free.) Gumpert and 
Biskamp both come from Hesse-Cassel and since the former may 
have an occasional bon mot up his sleeve, he might send it to his 
compatriot. Finally, let me have the name of some fellow (a 
STATIONER) in Manchester to whom Das Volk could be sent for 
distribution. (Write to the Bradfordian' 1 as well.) 
I consider Das Volk to be a dilettante rag like our Brussels and 
Paris papers.' But covertly and without intervening directly, we 
can use it to worry the life out of Gottfried, etc., etc. Again, the 
moment may come, and that very soon, when it will be of crucial 
importance that, not just our enemies, but we ourselves should be able 
to publish our views in a London paper. Biskamp works for 
nothing and hence is all the more deserving of support. 
What is really choice is that in No. 18 of the Hermann, the CLOWN 
wrote a highly inane, piddling sort of article in which he 'proves' 
that, because of 'England's neutrality', the present war is con-

deinned to be a 'hole and corner war'." 'Conclusive' deeds are no 
longer possible on the unhappy Continent, which is the reason why 
noble England remains 'neutral'. In No. 19 the  CI.OWN  is given a 
dressing-down by Blind from the indignant democratic-patriotic 
standpoint and by Bücher from the Urquhartite and thus, having 
been stamped upon by all parties, he will doubtless soon get the 
sack, even from the Hermann. 1' 
This has been a very good lesson for the louts. Scherzer, that 
old-Weitlingian jackass, imagined that he could nominate party 
representatives. At my meeting with a deputation of the louts (I 
have refused to visit any association, but Liebknecht is CHAIRMAN  of 
one and Laplander' of another 431) I told them straight out that we 
owed our position as representatives of the proletarian party to 
nobody but ourselves; this, however, had been endorsed by the 
exclusive and universal hatred accorded us by every faction and 
party of the old world. You can imagine how taken aback the oafs 
were. 
If you haven't any Po and Rhine left, you must order some.  COPIES 
are also needed for Steffen, Weydemeyer and several reviews

ENGELS TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 433 
IN BERLIN 
Manchester, 18 May 1859 
6 Thorncliffe Grove 
Dear Lassalle, 
You will have found it somewhat strange that I haven't written 
to you for so long, the more so since I owe you an opinion on 
your Sickingen." But that is precisely what has kept me from 
writing to you for so long. With the current and universal 
barrenness of fiction I seldom have a chance to read such a work, 
and for years I have never had a chance to read one of this kind 
in such a way that the reading of it resulted in a detailed 
judgment, a precisely stated opinion. The rubbish isn't worth the 
trouble. Even the few better English novels I read from time to 
time,  e. g. those of Thackeray, have never been able to elicit this 
interest in me, despite their undeniable literary and cultural 
significance. But, having lain fallow for so long, my judgment has 
lost most of its edge and I need a good deal of time before I can 
permit myself to express an opinion. Your Sickingen, however, 
deserves better treatment than that sort of stuff and so I've taken 
my time. The first and second readings of what is in every sense, 
both as regards material and treatment, a German national drama, 
stirred my emotions to the extent that I was compelled to put it 
aside for a while, the more so as my taste has become so vitiated in 
these lean times that it has reduced me, I'm ashamed to say, to a 
state in which sometimes even stuff of inferior quality inevitably 
has some effect on me at the first reading. So in order to be 
wholly unbiassed, wholly 'critical', I put Sickingen away, i. e. 
allowed a few of my acquaintances to borrow it (there are still a few 
Germans here who are more or less knowledgeable about literature). 
Habent sua fata libellih—if they're borrowed one rarely sets eyes on 
them again, and so I actually had to recover my Sickingen by force. I 
can tell you that, after the third and fourth readings, my impression 
has remained unaltered and, in the knowledge that your Sickingen 
can stand up to criticism, I shall now speak my mind.

I know that I am not paying you any particular compliment 
when I state the fact that not one of Germany's present official 
poets would be remotely capable of writing such a play. However, 
fact it is and one all too characteristic of our literature not to be 
voiced. Taking the formal aspect first, your skilful manipulation of 
the plot and the thoroughly dramatic nature of the piece came as 
a very pleasant surprise. Admittedly you have taken a good many 
liberties with the versification but this is more bothersome in the 
reading than it would be on the stage. I should very much like to 
have read the stage version434 ; as the play stands here it could 
certainly not be performed; I have had with me here a young 
German poet (Carl Siebel), a distant relative who hails from my 
neighbourhood, and has had a good deal to do with the stage. He 
may be coming to Berlin as a reservist in the Prussian Guard, in 
which case I may take the liberty of giving him a note for you. He 
thought highly of your play but considered a performance quite 
impracticable by reason of the long speeches in which only one 
actor is occupied while the others may run through their entire 
miming routine 2 or 3 times so as not to stand there like dummies. 
The last two acts give adequate proof that you experience no 
difficulty in making your dialogue brisk and lively and since, with 
the exception of a few scenes (as happens in any play), the same 
thing would seem to be feasible in the first 3, I don't doubt you 
have taken this circumstance into account in your stage version. 
The intellectual content must, of course, suffer as a result—but 
that's inevitable, and the complete fusion of greater intellectual 
profundity, of a consciously historical content (both of which you 
ascribe, not without reason, to the German drama 435), with 
Shakespearean vivacity and wealth of action will probably not be 
achieved—and perhaps not even by the Germans—until some 
time in the future. Indeed, that, to my mind, is where the future 
of the drama lies. Your Sickingen is entirely on the right lines; the 
chief protagonists in the action are representative of certain classes 
and tendencies, hence of certain ideas of their time, and derive 
their motives not from the petty appetites of the individual but 
from the very historical current by which they are borne along. 
But there is one advance that might yet be made in that these 
motives should emerge more of themselves, in a live, active, as it 
were spontaneous manner, more through the development of the 
action, while on the other hand reasoned debate (in which, by the 
way, I rediscovered with pleasure your old eloquence before the 
Assizes and the popular meeting 4:,fi) becomes increasingly super­
fluous. You yourself seem to recognise this ideal as a goal, since 

=====第477页=====
248. Engels to Lassalle. 18 May 1859 443 
you draw a distinction between stage drama and literary drama; I 
admit that Sickingen could be turned into a stage drama along the 
lines indicated, difficult though this would be (for it is truly no 
mean accomplishment). The characterisation of the protagonists is 
linked with this. You quite rightly oppose the cheap individualisa­
tion now prevalent, which amounts to nothing more than petty 
intellectual fireworks and is an essential characteristic of ineffectu­
al imitative literature. At the same time it seems to me that a 
person is not characterised merely by what he does, but also by 
how he does it; and in this respect it would, I think, have done the 
intellectual content of the play no harm had clearer distinctions 
and stronger contrasts been drawn between individual characters. 
The characterisation of the ancients no longer suffices today, and 
it is here, I think, that you might to your own advantage have paid 
rather more attention to the importance of Shakespeare in the 
historical development of the drama. But these are minor points 
which I bring up only to show you that I have also concerned 
myself with the formal aspect of your play. 
Now, as regards the historical content, you have presented what 
to you were the two most important aspects of the movement of 
lhat period very vividly and with justifiable reference to subse­
quent developments: the national aristocratic movement rep­
resented by Sickingen, and the humanist-theoretical movement, 
with its more extensive ramifications in the theological and 
ecclesiastical field, the Reformation. The scenes I like best are 
those between Sickingen and the Emperor3  and between the 
Legate and the Archbishop of Trier (here, in the contrast 
between the narrow-minded German prince of the church and the 
worldly Legate with his aesthetic and classical culture and political 
and theoretical foresight, you have, too, pulled off a nice piece of 
individual characterisation which nevertheless stems directly from 
the representative character of the two protagonists); in the scene 
between Sickingen and Charles the characterisation is also very 
striking. However, in making Hütten tell his life-story, c the content 
of which you rightly describe as essential, you have chosen a 
desperate means of introducing that content into the play. Also of 
great importance is the conversation in Act V between Balthasar 
and Franz during which the former remonstrates with his master 
about the genuinely revolutionary policy he should have followed. It 
is here that the real tragedy becomes apparent; and, precisely 
•' Charles V - '' Richard von Greifenklau - ' a scene between Hütten and Maria in 
Act III 

=====第478页=====
444 248. Engels to Lassalle. 18 May 1859 
because of this significance, it seems to me that it should have been 
rather more strongly indicated as early as Act III, in which there 
are several opportunities for this. But again I digress. 
The attitude of the towns and the princes at that time is likewise 
portrayed more than once with great clarity, thereby pretty well 
exhausting what might be called the official elements of the 
movement as it then was. But something upon which I should say 
you had failed to lay due emphasis are the non-official, plebeian 
and peasant elements, with their concomitant theoretical represen­
tation. In its own way the peasant movement was just as national, 
just as hostile to the princes, as that of the aristocracy, and the 
colossal dimensions of the struggle in which it succumbed contrast 
most significantly with the levity with which the aristocracy, leaving 
Sickingen in the lurch, gave itself up to its historical calling of 
sycophancy. Even allowing for your concept of the drama which, 
as you will have seen, is rather too abstract, not realistic enough, in 
my opinion, I should say that the peasant movement deserved 
closer attention; certainly, the peasant scene with Joss Fritz is true 
to type and the individuality of this 'agitator'437 is very accurately 
portrayed but, relative to the aristocratic movement, it does not 
represent with sufficient force what was then already a surging 
torrent of peasant agitation. In accordance with my view of the 
drama, which consists in not allowing the ideal to oust the real, or 
Schiller to oust Shakespeare, the introduction of society's plebei­
an section, so wonderfully colourful at the time, would have 
provided material of a quite different kind with which to animate 
the play, an incomparable backdrop for the national aristocratic 
movement going on down-stage, which would itself thus appear 
in its true light for the first time. What bizarre portraits does this 
period of dissolving feudal ties not bring forth! Vagabond beggar 
kings,  hungry mercenaries and adventurers of all kinds—a 
Falstaffian3 backdrop which, in a historical play in this sense, must 
needs be even more effective than in Shakespeare! But apart from 
that, I should say more particularly that neglect of the peasant 
movement is what has led you to give an incorrect idea, or so it 
seems to me, of one aspect of the national aristocratic movement 
also,  while at the same time allowing the truly tragic element in 
Sickingen's fate to escape you. In my view, it never occurred to the 
bulk of the nobility then subject direcdy to the emperor to form an 
alliance with the peasants; their dependence on the income 
deriving from oppression of the peasants did not admit of this. An 
a Falstaff is a character in Shakespeare's Henry IV and The Merry Wives of Windsor. 

=====第479页=====
248. Engels to Lassalle. 18 May 1859 445 
alliance with the towns would have been rather more feasible, but 
this did not come about either, or only in isolated instances. The 
national aristocratic revolution could, however, only have been 
effected by means of an alliance with the towns and the peasants, 
particularly the latter; and to my mind the tragic element lies 
precisely in the fact that this essential condition, alliance with the 
peasants, was impossible; that the policy of the aristocracy was 
therefore necessarily petty; that at the very moment when the 
aristocracy sought to take its place at the head of the national 
movement, the bulk of the nation, the peasants, protested against 
its leadership and hence ensured its downfall. To what extent 
there is any historical foundation for your assumption that 
Sickingen really did have some contact with the peasants, I am not 
able to judge, nor is it in any way relevant. So far as I can recall, 
by the way, whenever Hutten's writings are addressed to the 
peasants, they skate over the ticklish question of the aristocracy 
and seek to focus the peasants' wrath primarily on the clergy. But 
in no way do I dispute your right to portray Sickingen and Hütten 
as though it had been their intention to emancipate the peasants. 
However, this immediately presented you with the tragic con­
tradiction whereby these two found themselves placed between the 
aristocracy on the one hand, who definitely did not want this, and 
the peasants on the other. Here, in my view, lay the tragic clash 
between the historically necessary postulate and the impossibility 
of its execution in practice. By discarding this element you reduce 
the tragic conflict to the fact that Sickingen does not join battle 
straight away with Emperor and Empire, but with one prince 
only" (although here too your tact rightly leads you to introduce 
the peasants), while his downfall is made to ensue from nothing 
more than the indifference and pusillanimity of the aristocracy. 
This would, however, have been quite differently motivated had 
you laid more stress at an earlier stage on the mounting peasant 
movement and the mood of the aristocracy, inevitably grown more 
conservative as a result of the earlier Bundschuh and Poor Konrad 
movements. 438 All this, incidentally, represents only one way in 
which the peasant and plebeian movement might be brought into 
the play; one could think of at least ten others which would be just 
as good, if not better. 
As you can see, I am judging your work by a very high 
standard, indeed the highest there is, from both the aesthetic and 
the historical point of view, and the fact that I have to do so in

order to raise an objection here and there will provide you with 
the best proof of my appreciation. Between ourselves criticism has, 
of course, for years been necessarily as outspoken as possible in 
the interests of the party  itself;  but this aside, it is always a great , 
pleasure to me and all. of us when we are given fresh proof that 
our party, irrespective of the field in which it makes an 
appearance, invariably does so with distinction. And that is what 
you, too, have done on this occasion. 
In other respects it would seem that world events are about to 
take a truly delectable course. It would be difficult to imagine a 
better basis for a thorough-going German revolution than that 
provided by a Franco-Russian-alliance. The water has to be right 
up to our necks before we Germans are gripped en masse by the 
furor teutonicus"; and this time we would seem to be in sufficient 
danger of drowning. Tant mieux. b In such a crisis all existing 
powers must necessarily be ruined and all the parties crumble one 
after another, from the Kreuz-Zeitung to Gottfried Kinkel, and 
from Count Rechberg to 'Hecker, Struve, Blenker, Zitz and 
Blum' 439; in such a struggle the moment must necessarily come 
when only the most ruthless and resolute party is in a position to 
save the nation and, at the same time, the conditions be given 
which alone make it possible to jettison completely all the old 
trumpery—internal dissension on the one hand and, on the other, 
the Polish and Italian appendages which are the legacy of Austria.

Dear Moor, 
I entirely agree about the manifesto.11 What ought we to do 
about printing it? It will probably have to be printed in London; 
make some inquiries about costs and other PARTICULARS SO that we 
can launch it immediately it's been written.425 
The Völkchen' business is very amusing, very satisfactory, and 
may turn out to be extremely useful. 430 As regards its distribution 
here,  the following should be noted: While I could easily find an 
English 'STATIONER', he would never stand a chance of catching even 
a STRAY subscriber. To get hold of them we must have recourse to 
the FOREIGN BOOKSELLERS here, Dunnill and Palmer, Princess Street, 
and Franz Thimm, Princess Street. Lupus is taking out a 
subscription with Dunnill and Palmer, Gumpert and I with 
Thimm, who is our bookseller. The Hermann is very much on the 
wane here and there is a whole load of back-numbers; Thimm's 
manager, who doesn't seem overfond of Kinkel, tells me that the

subscribers get fewer every week. So send Thimm a dozen copies 
of the early numbers, particularly the one dealing with the Kinkel 
affair, 1 and another half-dozen or so to Dunnill and Palmer; as 
soon as it appears I shall set that chatterbox Heckscher in motion 
and he will start the thing circulating here as sure as 2x2=4. But 
the stuff for Thimm must be sent direct to the Thimm up here; 
the London chap would be perfectly capable of intercepting the 
things. Then, as soon as Thimm gets subscriptions here, the local 
salesmen will perhaps take a greater interest in the matter. 
I shall deal with the battle of Casteggio next Friday; the affair is 
too insignificant to warrant 2 articles and the telegrams are too 
vague to permit of anything worthwhile being said about it.1' Your 
old map of Lombardy has stood me in very good stead, the scale 
being approx. 1/160,000, hence quite large. Unfortunately the 
delineation of the ground is very poor.

[London,] 25 May 1859 
Dear Fred, 
As things stand here just now, it's doubtful whether I shall be 
able to leave London, certainly not at the beginning of next week. 
It is now a whole fortnight, or so I see from a note in my DIARY, 
since I sent that scoundrel Duncker the last 3 proof-sheets (i. e. 
sheets 9-11). The thing3 was ready, therefore, and all the chap had 
to do was send me the clean proofs of the last 3  sheets  for the list of 
misprints. Instead of that, what do I get? Lassalle's pamphletb and, 
as we hadn't any money in the house and pretty well everything 
has been pawned that can be pawned, I had to send my last 
wearable coat to the pawnshop since there was 2/- to pay on this 
rubbish, which might perhaps cost 8d in Berlin. But to come to 
the point: 
It is now KVIDENT, then, that a further fortnight's embargo has 
been placed on my thing in order to make way for Mr Lassalle. 
The work still to be done on it would take 3 hours at the most. 
But that infernal and conceited fool has decreed the embargo in 
order to secure the undivided attention publici. c Duncker, the 
swine, is happy as a sandboy, however, since it gives him a further 
excuse to postpone payment of my fee. I shan't forget the trick 
the little Jew has played. The speed with which his tripe was 
printed shows that he was magna parsd responsible for our stuff 
being delayed. Besides the oaf is so enamoured of his laborious 
emanations that he takes it for granted that I'm burning with 
impatience to see his 'anonymous' pamphlet and am 'objective' 
enough to take the killing of my stuff as a matter of course. 
The confounded Jew in Viennae hasn't written either. 
Lupus is greatly mistaken about Liebknecht if he imagines that 
this worthy citizen could himself have composed a piece such as 
'Der Reichsregent'. 4"1 Biskamp wrote it f (I gave him the FACTS) and 
it must be Biskamp that writes everything. Nothing is attributable to 
Liebknecht save the 'Politische Rundschau', dated London with the

writer  is  only equalled  by his  unreliability  and  weakness  of 
character, about which  I shall have more  to say  later.  The  fellow 
would have been kicked  out for  good this week  had  there  not 
been special circumstances that necessitated  his  being kept  on for a 
while  as a  scarecrow. 
Even  if my  private circumstances—apart from waiting  for 
Duncker—were  not  likely  to preclude  my  coming  up to  Manches­
ter next week, there would  be the  further consideration that, were 
I to abandon  my  post, everything might easily  go to  rack  and  ruin 
in view  of the  vast intrigues being conjured  up  here, there,  and 
everywhere  by the  emigre democrats,  the  merchants  of Camber-
well,  the  Weitlingians,  etc., etc., and in  view  of the  extraordinary 
feebleness  of the  people  who are  supposed  to represent  us here. 
Yesterday,  by the by, I got  Pfänder  to give categoric instructions  to 
that inert hunk  of flesh, Schapper,  to the  effect that  if he did not 
rejoin  the  Workers' Society  (the  so-called communist one) 3" 
forthwith  and  take over  the  MANAGEMENT  thereof,  I would sever  all 
'connections' with  him.  This  is the one  sphere  in which  we  could 
make  use of the  hippopotamus,  yet the  fool thinks  it beneath  him.

Something more descriptive  and  individual could easily  be gleaned 
from  the  Times  CORRESPONDENT,  etc. I  can't interpolate  it myself  as 
this would lead  to unevenness  of style. Failing this Dana will  go and 
insert some utter nonsense  off his own bat. 
Today  I am  sending  you 2  numbers  (the  last ones)  of the  Presse

At 7 o'clock yesterday evening  Mr  Liebknecht turned  up  with  6 
lines  for Das  Volk having,  by his  failure  to appear  (and the  idiot  is 
always taking  on all  manner  of things), thrown  the  entire setting

he doesn't succeed. Bürgers redivivus h but far  WORSE,  since

MARX  TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  28 May  [1859] 
Dear Engels, 
Herewith  a letter  I have received from Dana. What should  I 
answer? 
Apropos.  I have just learned from Biskamp,  on the  authority  of 
the CLOWN3  himself, that Bruno Bauer  was  definitely  in the pay of 
Russia.  He  received  300  friedrichsdors from  von  Budberg,  the 
Russian ambassador.  The  CLOWN  was  brought  in as  accomplice. 
Bruno dropped  the  thing because Budberg didn't treat  him 
'respectfully'  and  left him to  chambrer 0 in the  antichambre.  He came 
to England  for the  purpose  of attempting, with  his  brother—par 
nobile fratrum c—a similar transaction with  the  English government. 
Fell through,  OF  COURSE. WHAT  DO YOU SAY TO  THIS? 
Salut. 
Your 
K. M.

prevented from replying to my friends.432 
After your receipt of my manuscript a fortnight elapsed before I 
got any acknowledgment. In it you said that printing was to 
commence a week later. That week turned into more than three 
weeks. About eight weeks ago Lassalle wrote to say that the thing 
would be finished by the middle of May. More than three weeks ago 
I received the last three proof-sheets. The amendments that were 
called for could easily have been made in a single day. Instead, work 
would again seem to have been completely suspended during that 
time,  although printing was  complete.  I hereby declare that I am tired 
of this systematic and deliberate procrastination and that I hereby 
demand, and indeed categorically, that you desist from these 
machinations, the purpose of which seems to me exceedingly 
suspect. All my acquaintances in England are of the same opinion 
and have earnestly enjoined me to take the above step. 
Yours faithfully,

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 1 June 1859 
Dear Engels, 
Enclosed 1 copy of the Presse containing some particulars that 
may be of interest to you. No answer from that fellow, 
Friedländer, 254 needless to say. However, my present explanation 
for this is as follows: When he lectured Friedländer about bias, a 
Lassalle did so, OF COURSE, not only in his but also in my name. 
Friedländer believes that I am hand in glove with Heraclitus the 
Dark Philosopher. b So he naturally can't imagine that under PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES I can write for a Viennese, paper. Every day the 
Vienna Presse contains veiled attacks upon the Berlin wiseacre. 
Thus,  for instance, in a leading article on 29 May: 
'But how can one demand a sense of national self-respect of those speculative 
minds which see in Napoleon III the avenging arm of history and, in his alleged 
genius for liberating the peoples, complacently admire the reflection of the 
ineptitude, pedantry and aridity of their own categorising intellects.' 
The very insistence with which Lassalle required of me not to 
write any more to his cousin c is evidence that the fellow carried on 
his intrigues in my name also. Thus the blockhead has frustrated 
the best prospect I had for the summer. Besides, in certain 
eventualities it would be a good thing if I had some say in the 
Vienna Presse. 
When you next write about Garibaldi, WHATEVER MAY BE HIS FATE, 
crack a joke about the curious position in which only 'his uncle's 
nephew"1 could have found  himself,  namely that beside him the 
leader of the volunteer corps figures as a  HERO.  Can you imagine 
anything of the kind happening under the old Napoleon? By the 
by, in today's Times the Paris correspondent writes that the 
Bonapartists are already GRUMBLING loudly about Garibaldi's 'fame', 
and that  A FEW  SELECT POLICE have been smuggled into his corps and 
send in detailed reports about him.e Adhering strictly to Mazzini's 
instructions, Garibaldi omitted all mention of Bonaparte in his 
proclamation.441 Mazzini's latest thing' is not, by the by, as good as

under  a false assumption, have been forced  to  give this  man 
regarding  the  appearance  of the  book,  has  more than sufficed  to 
show me up as a  REGULAR HUMBUG  in the eyes of the aforesaid John 
Bull.  The  repeated  and  impatient inquiries  of my  friends  and in 
the end, the  rumour that  the  thing will  not be  coming  out at 
all—a rumour carefully disseminated,  out of  what motives  I 
cannot  say, by a  Berlin clique here—finally proved  too  much  for 
my patience. 
Lastly,  I trust that,  in consideration  of these reasons,  you  will 
regard  my  letter merely  as the  hasty expression  of an  irritability 
aroused  by all  manner  of circumstances  and  absolve  me of any

DEAR  Frederick, 
You must excuse  me for not  writing  to you  before,  and  only 
these  few  lines.  My  time  has  been completely taken  up  with work 
and with running private  and  party errands. 
D'abord1  I was  delighted  to  hear that  you  liked  the  first

To my wife's considerable  AMUSEMENT,  I awaited  WITH SOME ANXIETY YOUR 
JUDGMENT. 
Ad vocemc  'Volk': Admittedly  its administration leaves  a great deal 
to be  desired, since there  is only  one  type-setter,  no  errand-boy, 
etc., on top of  which  not a  single 'trustworthy' despatch clerk  has 
yet presented  himself,  and  above  all, no  money. Nevertheless,

can be found of appointing a reasonably reliable despatch clerk, 
the thing will survive. Moreover, the 'little sheet', although only 
indirectly given a  TURN  by us, has set the whole of democracy by 
the ears. Not just here, but also in Switzerland, where Vogt-
Kinkel have pitched into me in the Handels-Courier with one of 
those blackguardly little articles with which you are familiar. 3 I'll 
get them to reproduce it in the next number.b 
I shall speak to Biskamp on the Manchester question. For his 
part, he asked me yesterday to write and tell you that not a single 
copy had been ordered in Manchester. It looks to me as though 
Hollinger (the printer) has already been bribed by Kinkel. Nous 
verrons. 0 
Kinkel, following an audience with Kossuth and money pay­
ments from Vogt, has gone over to the camp of high treason. 
Bücher and Blind have resigned in 'indignation'. Kinkel's col­
leagues are now as follows: Bamberger, Ed. Bauer, Beta (How do 
you do?) and Born d (our ex-Born'se brother). A fine lot. Add to 
which one or two old whores. 
Ad vocem Freiligrath. Between ourselves, a rotter. Having now 
seen that things are taking a revolutionary TURN (you must have 
heard about the labour RIOT in Berlin44  ) and that Kinkel is 
becoming DISRESPECTABLE, he reviles him. But the sixth and last 
volume of his collected works (s/é of it translated rubbish) 
published in America, which he has just received and sent me, 
concludes with the poem about Johanna Mockel/ whereas he has 
suppressed the anfi-Kinkel poem. 8 This is a filthy thing to do and 
it was with very sceptical mien that I listened to his excuses on the 
subject. The devil take the bardic profession. 
Ad vocem Vogt. Has placed himself at Prussia's 'disposal' in the 
Volks-Zeitung (Berlin). 
Ad vocem Duncker. That dolt Duncker, to whom I had written in 
exceedingly rude terms about his dilly-dallying, has sent me a 
letter admitting outright that the last delay of 3 weeks (when 
everything had been completed save for the list of misprints) was 
due to the publication of the 'anonymous pamphlet',b the one 
concocted of 'sweat, fire and logic'.422 I deliberately divulged to the 
press the fact that you were the author of Po and Rhine, 43 because

I had good reason to suppose that the author of the 'anonymous

bit thick, Mr Lassalle placing an embargo on me at will! The thing 
is coming out in Berlin this week—my first instalment, I mean.

The rotten STAFF here is no joke, I assure you. Biskamp at least 
writes quickly and has a ready wit. Liebknecht is AN AWFUL  NUISANCE. 
Due to his over-ingenious manoeuvrings, the little sheet was only 
able to publish the gossip about Kinkel and Bauer in a much 
attenuated form. b 
Your article0  appeared in the Volk on the same day it arrived.

omissions as Mr Biskamp thought fit.

work. Today is the day for the Tribune articles.b So there's not a 
minute to spare. Hence I'm merely writing to let you know that I

This much for the present:

you have a reply.445 
Ad vocem pamphlet In no way corresponds with my own view or 
that of my party friends in England. It is probable, by the by, that 
we shall express our view in print. 
Ad vocem Duncker: Have written to tell him I'm sorry if my letter 
offended him. However it's a scandalous piece of procrastination. I 
received the last proof-sheete as much as 5 weeks ago. You can't 
expect me—once I have a contract—to behave towards a publisher 
or permit myself to be treated by him as though he were printing 
the thing only as a 'favour' to  yourself.  One good turn he has 
already done me, and that is to lose me my English publisher until 
further notice. 
Ad vocem Vogt (Imperial bailiff) 410: We  possess  evidence, not only 
that the man has received money for himself from Bonaparte, but 
also money to suborn Germans in the interests of Franco-Russian 
propaganda.420  Up till now he has succeeded only in the case of

Dear Frederick, 
Two manuscripts received today. One of them splendid—yours on 
'fortification', though I must say I feel some twinges of conscience 
about having made such demands on the litde spare time you 
have.  One grotesque, viz. Lassalle's reply to myself and you 
respecting his Sickingen.445 A whole sheaf of closely written pages. 
Incredible that at this season and in the present historical 
circumstances, a man should not only find time to produce stuff 
of this kind  himself,  but actually presume that we have time to 
read it. 
Ad vocema  Volk. Should your booksellers actually deliver the 
little paper to you, which I doubt, you and Lupus will be surprised 
to see in tomorrow's issue an announcement that there is some 
'prospect' of our, etc., collaboration. b The diplomatic reasons 
which decided me to talce this step will be communicated by word 
of mouth. 
Duncker: Nothing yet received, neither money nor copies.0 Tell 
Lupus about this; he'd already have had one otherwise. 
Ad vocem Schramm*: This great man was a failure in Berlin. His 
wife's family council therefore decided that he should take a 
minor commercial post in Krefeld. Thereupon the 'failure' 
addressed a long scrawl to the Ministers in Berlin saying he had 
considered it his political duty to join combat with Minister 
Manteuffel, whom he abhorred, but now, having fulfilled that 
duty, and finding that Prussia was not à sa hauteur à lui, c requested 
to be released from the commonwealth of subjects. Granted, and 
Schramm arrived in London along with the other PARCELS. NOW 
intends, as he warned the Hohenzollern cabinet, to get himself 
'naturalised' an Englishman. The worst blow that has befallen 
Prussia since the batde of Jena. 46

Manchester,444  22 June [1859] 
Dear Sir, 
I would request you to send the balance of the fee for my book b 
without delay to my wife in London. 
In the letter you wrote me at the end of May you said that the 
book would come out and the fee be paid 'next week'. Neither the 
one nor the other was done until today, 22 June. Your principle 
would seem to be that a 'strictly scientific work' can never come out 
too late and, more particularly, that one should wait until such time 
as the general spread of the war 37° has stimulated a 'strictly scientific' 
interest. 
The same circumstances as have induced you to sanction this 
further postponement might, perhaps, justify a postponement 
until 1860, particularly in view of what you say in your letter, 
namely that, in the case of scientific works in  respect  of which there is 
no undertaking as to the time of publication, it is customary for 
German publishers to place an embargo on their appearance in 
favour of topical works whenever this would seem to be 
opportune.

MARX  TO  ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,]  14  July  1859 
DEAR  Frederick, 
You must have been wondering about  my  long silence,  but  there 
was a perfectly natural explanation  for it.  During  the  first week448 
I had to  scurry round like  mad in an  attempt  to get Das  Volk into 
some kind  of order,  and  this week  PRIVATE MATTERS  obtruded. 
WELL.  The  state  of the  Volk when  I got  back  was as  follows: 
Kinkel  had  been felled  by our  latest quips. (Since then  I have gone 
on with  the  'GATHERINGS'.  49 In the  current issue  I'll do  this section 
by myself.  Unless,  of course, some piece  of news gives Biskamp 
occasion  to introduce  a few  more drolleries.)  But at the  same time 
Das Volk showed every sign  of disintegrating,  and it was  doubtful 
whether  it would continue  to appear. During  my  absence debts 
had been contracted amounting  to  over  £6,  since  the  'agents', 
printer, 3 old  Uncle  Tom  Cobley  and all  suspected that  my  return 
would put an end to the fun. Biskamp was  IN THE  MOST DEJECTED STATE. 
He had  been given notice  by the  Kölnische b (having been 
denounced  by a  competitor);  to receive charity from Speck went 
against  the  grain,  and he had  therefore spent several nights 
camping  out in the  'park'. Finally,  the  printer  had  been 
approached  by  'genuine democrats, likewise socialists,  but  moder­
ate, and  inimical  to any  kind  of personal politics (Blind?)',  who 
were prepared  to take over  Das  Volk  and  provide  the  necessary 
subsidies.  SUCH WAS  THE  GENERAL STATE OF THINGS WHEN  I ARRIVED  AT LONDON. 
a Fidelio Hollinger  - b Kölnische Zeitung 

=====第498页=====
464 263. Marx to Engels. 14 July 1859 
First I gave Biskamp £3, at the same time persuading him to 
accept a schoolmaster's post in Edmonton which, since he won't be 
required to live in, do any supervision or give more than 4 lessons, 
will permit him to write just as much for the paper as  hitherto.  OTHERWISE 
he would soon have been DISARMED by misfortune and idleness. He 
is moving there on the first of August. Actually he won't be any 
further away from London than I am.429  On the other hand, it will 
be better for me if he is not present in person when I myself have 
more to do with the paper, as I intend to do  BY and  BY. I only paid 
out £1 5/- for the paper (debts) and compelled Garthe, Speck and 
a few louts to get together the sum of £3 15/- as part payment for 
Hollinger. In addition I had to repay Mr Liebknecht the 16/- he 
had advanced to Hollinger during my absence. Hence £5 1/- had 
to be expended before 'current' operations began. These included 
15/- paid to Carstens," 5/- for rent of the despatch room, 4/- for 
STAMPS,  2/6d advanced to Mr Hollinger in respect of No. 9. So as 
you can see, I've pretty well scraped the bottom of the barrel 
before I've begun. However, if we maintain the pressure for a few 
more weeks there is every prospect that the Hermann will go 
under and leave us in complete possession of the field. 
Moreover, with the new despatch arrangements the thing will 
become SELF-PAYING. I am of the firm opinion that, even if we have 
to set the little paper's sights rather lower for a time, we must,  AT A 
CERTAIN MOMENT, give it a meaningful line. Should the Hermann go 
under we shall change over to Hirschfeld's press. (Cheaper, gives 
more credit, more expeditious.) FOR THE MOMENT, however, it's 
absolutely essential that a few more subsidies be sent from 
Manchester. 
Napoleon's peace*50  exceeds all my expectations. Yesterday the 
French revolutionary gang in London were all of them exultant 
and Louis Blanc was running around like a madman; the Italians, 
however, are gnashing their teeth. Even Mazzini, although he 
foretold the result 6 weeks before the end of the war, succumbed 
AFTERWARDS all the same to the illusion that Bonaparte would at least 
throw THE AUSTRIANS out of Italy. I have read a letter  (PRIVATE  LETTER) 
from an Irishman who sleeps with the Duchesse de Padua in Paris. 
According to this man, the secret articles of the treaty stipulate 
two Turkish provinces for Austria; the amalgamation of the 
Prussian Rhine Province and Belgium into a 'Catholic state', or 
rather the use of this 'new empire' as a pretext for snapping up 
the delicious titbits.

The over-ingenuity of Prussia, with the support of Lassalle," etc.,

Dear Moor, 
I'd have written something about the peace450  for the Volk, but 
since I neither see nor hear anything of what's going on, I 
conclude that you are dealing with the subject yourself and hence 
that my article would be double emploi? 
Excepting the continuation of the war, nothing could be more 
welcome to us than this peace. Prussia discredited, Austria 
discredited, Bonaparte discredited, Sardinia and vulgar Italian 
liberalism discredited, England discredited, Kossuth ruined, Vogt 
& Co. discredited, no gains for anybody except the Russians and 
the revolutionaries, i. e. what little Jew Braun e would call a 'tidy 
revolutionary situation'. 451 But His Excellency Ephraim Artful e is 
the most discredited of all.

DEAR  Frederick, 
Since the last number of the Volk proved so very exiguous, I 
intend this week to put something in about Russia. It would please 
me greatly if an article by you could appear at the same time. 
Wouldn't it be possible to do something military summing up the 
campaign, or else ridiculing the whole affair?" But it would have 
to be here by Thursday. If the little sheet fails to appear on 
Friday, it always means a serious loss of revenue; last time this fell 
off appreciably, another reason being that we suddenly had to 
change all our agents and get rid of Scherzer among others. The 
CLOWN  Edgar Bauer (an admirer of Bonaparte) has uttered a 
mighty threat, viz. that we are to be attacked in the next Hermann.

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 18 July 1859 
Dear Moor, 
I shall send you tomorrow or the day after the £5 still required 
to pay off the Volk's arrears. It was too late for me to do it today, 
and besides I have the company of the 'little man', scilicet3 
Dronke, who sidled up to me at the Exchange; the little chap's 
business seems to be doing passably well. Apart from current 
day-to-day gossip, on which he holds forth like a pothouse 
politician, he seems reluctant to talk about politicis, particularly of 
the past, and this I encourage, for after all I treat him as an 
extraneus.h His knowledge, however, has not increased, and the 
profundity of his politics may be summed up in his remark that 
the Italians 'have got to hit out now, or they're not worth a thing'. 
But to revert from the little man to the Volk; we must at once 
discuss what is to be done. If the £7 you took with you has 
vanished so quickly, and the louts' £3 15/- as well, the £3 I have in 
reserve will doubtless soon be gone too. Que faire? c I've heard 
nothing about Strohn's return. There's not much more to be done 
with Borchardt. As soon as Lupus returns—but heaven knows 
where he is—I shall at all events get him to carry out a 
reconnaissance. Before that I wouldn't care to approach him 
personally. Nor do I run across him any more, though I've several 
times kept half an eye open for him in Oxford Road. 
At any rate you must let me know sometime exactly how matters 
stand financially under the new administration, so that I can have 
an answer ready to eventual queries. How many copies are now 
being sold? Have you cut down the newsboys, etc., to 1/2d per 
copy? What do the total weekly expenses amount to and what is the 
income—hence what is the deficit? 
Mr Thimm has been talked round very nicely. Das Volk is now 
displayed in his window IN  A CONSPICUOUS POSITION, a much better one 
than the Hermann and the  KOJIOKOJIK,  which flank it. A few more 
'Gatherings' and the last-named" 1 will doubtless be done for 
a to wit - b outsider - c What is to be done? - d  Engels has 'den letzteren', probably a 
slip of the pen; 'den ersteren' ('the first-named') would fit the context better, as the 
'Gatherings' were directed against the Hermann, not against the  KOJIOKOJIÎ>.

altogether.440  The way in which Kinkel has suddenly taken to his 
heels is very funny. a 
Next week's LEADER on the peace ought to be done by you. It's 
important, I think, since we've been lucky enough to get hold of 
the secret articles,b that this point be fully exploited. As you are 
making a Tribune article0  out of it anyway, that should be easy for 
you. This point may well give the Volk a significance of quite a 
tlifferent order, and exact for it a position in the press. Think this 
over. 
Let me know also by return what you people would like me 
to write about this week; then I shall do it on Wednesday 
evening. 
I have sent for the Portfolio and am studying these and other 
Russian documents and Palmerstoniana; shall also get hold of as 
many BACK NUMBERS of The Free  Press  as possible. It's really high time 
I went through the  stuff,  seeing what importance the thing is now 
assuming. Can you tell me where the Russian memorandum on 
Russian policyd originated and which Prussian ministerial crisis 
brought it to the light of day452? So far as I am concerned the 
internal EVIDENCE and the classic phraseology are, of course, more 
than sufficient, but I need these  FACTS  for the debate with Philistia; 
anyway it is stupid of Urquhart to be so unnecessarily secretive. 
Is there anything to be wormed out of Blind  quoad"  Vogt 420? 
The 'little man' doesn't believe the thing, of course, and asks 'why, 
then, didn't we see to it that the documents were printed'? 
Generally speaking the documents in Vol. 1 of the Portfolio are 
not the most important, though there are some nice things among 
them, particularly those by Pozzo di Borgo and the memorandum 
to the German governments.' What idiots they are and how the 
Russians must laugh at them! 
The memorandum in The Free Press is a true classic from start 
to finish, including the almost comical way in which the worthy 
diplomats make out that regicide is at once self-sacrifice and a 
republican virtue. Still, it seems to be going a bit far when 
Nicholas8 gives his sonh this kind of lesson with regard to the

DEAR  Frederick, 
I would gladly have written the article on the peace, for it would 
simply have meant combining last Friday's and today's articles for the 
Tribune^ They were, moreover, good articles, for ira facit poetam. c 
However, as Biskamp has begun the thing, has already announced No.

precludes one interfering in this way. Once he is in Edmonton, his 
very remoteness will ensure that at crucial moments such as this the

LEADER  can be taken out of his hands without hurt to his amour 
propre —which is all he gets out of it. 
But what the two of us can do to put some stiffening into the 
next issue, is support him on his left and right flanks. On the 
pretext of discussing Urquhart's document," I shall briefly sum up 
Russia's PART in this tragi-comedy and at the same time disparage 
Bonaparte.454 You, on the pretext of writing a final article on 
military affairs,1" must also set about Bonaparte, etc. (and on the 
same occasion take a swipe at Prussia). In my view it is of the 
utmost importance morally that a belief in Bonaparte's greatness 
should not be allowed to arise among the Germans. As for 
Austria, the agreed  LINE  we have adopted of blaming everything on 
the sovereignc is SUFFICIENT. 
Ad vocemd the document. Fell into the hands of the 'Prince of 
Prussia'6 during the regency crisis on the occasion of Manteuffel's 
sudden removal.336 More than that is not to be coaxed out of 
Urquhart's idiots. Certain passages have been forged because they 
didn't get hold of the complete document.452 The authenticity of the 
whole is vouched for by the style peculiar to all, even 'secret', 
Russian documents, in which certain stereotyped, conventional 
untruths take turn and turn about. It is a  LINE  even Pozzo di Borgo 
adopts in his writing. The plain truth about Russia's machinations 
comes to light only with the chance publication of the documents 
of Russian agents not in the direct employ of the Russian state.

Dear Engels, 
£3 received. Immediately paid out £2 to Hollinger and 15/- to 
Lessner. Out-of-town subscriptions are increasing (there are 
already 60) but are not payable until the end of the quarter and 
call for a weekly ouday on STAMPS. I am now convinced, 1. that 
there was a debt of  ABOUT  £7 of which I was not told before I left 
for Manchester444; 2. that the advertisements (instead of £5, 
receipts were ABOUT 20/-) and Mr Scherzer's London subscrip­
tions—  I have sacked him—were just a piece of private skuldug­
gery. With proper MANAGEMENT, which is now under way but whose 
results won't make themselves felt for weeks to come, the 
advertisements alone will pay for the little sheet. Since more 
money is needed immediately, write to Dronke. If you tell the litde 
man that for the time being the paper can only exist by party 
sacrifices and hence we are asking all party members to make 
such sacrifices, he can, if he wishes, get the letter printed. I am 
convinced that, within 6 weeks, the thing will be on a solid footing. 
But there can be no question of giving it up now that Gagern and

Co., in short the entire 1848 gang, are again taking the stage. 
Thimm has asked us to put his name in the paper as our 
distributor in Manchester. I could not carry out my intention this 
week, for I was overcome by a kind of cholera as a result of the 
heat and was vomiting from morning till night. Being able to write 
again today, I have written for the Tribune,  A GLORIOUS  VINDICATION of 
your military article,3 basing it on Francis Joseph's and 
Bonaparte's manifestos.6  The paper had been so much intimidated 
that it suppressed all your articles for a time. During my absence 
Blind was scheming to gain control of the Volk. I wrote him an 
exceedingly rude letter, which was followed by an INTERVIEW. After 
that, however, there'll be no dunning the man for money for a 
while. Philistine Freiligrath hasn't even paid his subscription, 
although pressed twice. Instead, when speaking to Mr Juch, he 
deprecated the 'undignified' tone of the Volk, although he tells us 
that he is 'delighted' with it.  * By and by we shall take our revenge 
upon these diplomatical fellows.* 
You forgot to let me know whether you wish to do a review of 
my piece.c  There is great rejoicing among the fellows here. They 
imagine the thing's a failure because they are ignorant of the fact 
that Duncker hasn't even advertised it yet. Should you write 
something, don't forget, 1. that it extirpates Proudhonism root 
and branch, 2. that the specifically social, by no means absolute, 
character of bourgeois production is analysed straight away in its 
simplest form, that of the commodity. Mr Liebknecht informed 
Biskamp that 'never has a book disappointed him so much', and 
Biskamp himself told me that he didn't see 'à quoi bon'. d Is Lupus 
back? 
In your second article on the ware you will not, I am sure, 
forget to stress the inadequate strength of the pursuit after victory 
had been won, and the pitiful whining of Bonaparte, who had at 
last got to the point where Europe did not, as hitherto, out of fear 
of revolution, permit him to play the old Napoleon within given 
limits.  In this connection it would be pertinent to recall the 
1796-97 campaign, when France was not able to take her time

Dear Moor, 
Have written to Duncker.456 Also about the total absence up till 
now of any advertisements of your book3  in the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung and Kölnische Zeitung. I can't possibly do an 
article on it this week; it is quite an undertaking and I should have 
had NOTICE of it somewhat earlier. Besides, I've begun the military 
article 13 and want to get it finished quickly. However, I promise to 
do the article for next week.c 
Some nonsense was edited into my last article. I said that, 
during the march from Pavia, the 5th corps so exerted itself on 
the 3rd and 4thd that, had the 4'/2 hours lost through the halt 
been put to use, the result would not have been materially 
different, nor would the corps have arrived on the battle-field

appreciably earlier. In print it says that it was the halt alone which 
made that exertion possible, which 1. is just the opposite and 2. is 
nonsense. In the first place the troops were not in the least tired at 
6 o'clock in the morning of the 3rd, having only fust moved off, so 
that the halt could be of no benefit to them, and secondly the halt 
deprived them of the cool hours of the morning and forced them 
to march when the midday heat was at its greatest. To any military 
man, the sentence as it now stands would seem quite preposterous. 
Much good all these stylistic improvements do me anyway, if 
printing errors are responsible for the most egregious nonsense, 
e.g. rest for thrust (!) and so forth. My articles are particularly 
distinguished by this kind of nonsense, the remainder being 
tolerably well corrected. 
How, by the way, could you permit Herwegh's lousy poema to 
be included? 
Quanto al danaro,b  Dronke will be back here again in a 
fortnight's time (about 10 days from now, that is), so I shall have to 
put everything off till then. Nor have I any news of Lupus. Where 
to get money from in the meantime is difficult to say. I'll try 
Heckscher, but just now I have my hands full and a great deal of 
my time is taken up with the article on your book. If only Strohn 
were here! Gumpert is at home, confined to bed with laryngitis 
and unable to speak. However, I shall see; if at all possible 
Heckscher will have to keep the paper going this week. But the 
miserly Freiligrath should certainly be made to cough up. 
How funny that you should have obtained so flattering an 
opinion from Mr Liebknecht too. c It's just like these folk. The 
gentlemen are so used to our doing their thinking for them that 
invariably and without exception they want to have everything 
presented to them not only on a platter, but already pre-digested, 
not only the quintessence in the smallest possible space, but also a 
detailed exposition, READY COOKED AND DRIED. One is expected to 
perform miracles, ni plus ni moins. 6 What does an ass of that 
species really want? As though he couldn't discover for himself 
from the first 3 lines of the preface that this first instalment was to 
be followed by at least 15 others before he got to the final 
conclusions. Naturally, the solutions to ticklish monetary problems, 
etc., mean nothing whatever to Liebknecht, seeing that such 
problems simply don't exist for him. But the least one could ask of

the printer is the only one to blame. Herwegh's rotten poem" got 
in without my knowing about it. I therefore compelled Biskamp to 
give an explanation in the last issue b and, INTO THE BARGAIN, I got 
him to publish the Landwehr soldier's song (as a fitting sequel to 
Herwegh). 458 
What is catastrophic so far as I'm concerned is that Biskamp 
isn't going to Edmonton but (it would seem) has accepted the post 
of tutor chez Bibra (the innkeeper) in the middle of the West End. 
If this is so I shall press for a written agreement with the 
gentleman. For, like all professional humorists he's a capricious, 
hysterical old woman, and we're not going to right the apple-cart 
so that someone else can drive it away. We must make sure we get 
possession of the thing. 
Linac  is back here from Cologne. Bürgers has grown quite 
'high-minded' since his release. He reprobates the Volk's 'rever­
sion' to the old manner of using 'bad jokes' to split the 'party'. For 
him, it would seem, the 'party' comprises anyone who is 'not' 
official, and that includes Vogt and Kinkel. Needless to say these 
'hints'  were given merely out of tender regard for 'me'. 'One' copy 
of my work had arrived at Bermbach's for the dozen or so party 
friends in Cologne. Bürgers hadn't read it, of course, nor will he, 
'but in my interests' expressed his indignation that the thing 
should be coming out 'by dribs and drabs' and not all 60 sheets  AT 
ONCE. For the rest, he's tutor at some 'merchant's', which only takes 
up a few hours each morning, and apart from that he gives one 
other lesson. All in all, he earns 700 talers. His 'work' is confined 
to mornings. After the midday meal he starts 'recovering' from his 
half day's work and lounges about chatting by the hour at Mrs 
Daniels' house where, however, he has a serious rival in Dr Klein. 
But in the evenings he hurries to Löllchen's to preside with great 
dignity over the Cologne debating club until far into the night. He 
'esteems' Lassalle's activities but hasn't 'read' anything of his, not 
even Franz von Sickingen. The spurious pretext of having 
contracted a serious chest complaint during his time in prison has 
provided him with a splendid means of masking his habitual 
idleness. In addition, the 'high-minded man' frequents 'music 
clubs'.  As regards the Cologne trial 71 he actually repeated to Lina 
several most infamous and far from unwitting lies, e.g. that it was 
us not him and the other asses in Cologne who sent that ass

convincing examples of the materialistic viewpoint would not come 
amiss,  in place of my indifferent reference to the February

Would it be possible to scrape together some money for the 
Volk by Wednesday morning? 
Last Monday (Monday is always settlement day; i.e. a week ago 
today) the toted deficit had been reduced to no more than about 
£2. (This did not, of course, include the charge for No. 13, which 
only has to be met today, and still less for No. 14, where payment 
doesn't fall due until today week. The issues are, of course, only 
charged at the end of the week following publication.) So things 
are in good shape. But today there is further expenditure to be 
met, in addition to the usual £1 extra (15/- for Lessner, 5 for the 
OFFICE). I myself am under so much PRESSURE that I cannot at this 
moment advance a single  FARTHING  and am, moreover, wasting an 
inordinate amount of time over the business. As for philistine 
Freiligrath, he imagines that he is giving adequate proof of his 
'convictions' by maintaining a 'neutral' attitude towards ourselves 
and the Hermann. 
Ledru and L. Blanc have united to publish a paper, the Union 
Républicaine. It is to appear at the beginning of next month from 
the same press as the Volk, and would benefit the latter in as much 
as Hollinger would then print by machine instead of by hand as 
heretofore. 462 It makes the continued existence of the Volk all the 
more essential, by the by. 
Later on (as soon as I'm fit again), I shall write to Germany 
about the business. And to Borchardt too? 
To make the thing a PAYING proposition more quickly, fresh 
outlays would be necessary in a town like London: errand-boys 
besides Lessner, etc.

No answer yet from Duncker, the swine?

Dear Moor, 
Just now I'm in such a jam, paying off private debts which have 
accumulated in respect of the new financial year, that only in the 
case of direst need shall I be able to advance any money to the 
Volk during the next few weeks. I neither see nor hear anything 
of Strohn, but should know at once if he returned to Bradford. If 
the worst comes to the worst you could always write to 
Borchardt—I don't see why not. Then you could let me know 
and, if necessary, Lupus might also drop in on him. I neither see 
nor hear anything of Borchardt. 
Yesterday evening, when about to- write the 2nd article on your 
book,3 I was interrupted in such a way as to preclude further 
work. I shan't be able to make up for lost time today and so the 
article will have to be put off till next week, greatly to my 
annoyance. 
I was out of town from Saturday to Monday, and on Monday 
evening found the enclosed scrawl from Duncker.463 The note I 
enclose will enable you to obtain the 6 copies of Po and Rhine; 
send me those you don't need. Freiligrath has had one. It's really 
high time the fool was forced to adopt a less equivocal position, or 
at very least to shell out. 
Duncker is frankly trying to do me down. Lassalle mentioned 
2,000 copies; now he claims to have printed only  1,000.  Siebel, 
who is back here again, tells me that, to judge by his own 
experience of the pamphlet's success with booksellers, this must be 
a lie. Que faire? b 
What do you think of the pretty excuse for failing to advertise

Dear Engels, 
I received the enclosed notea on Thursday afternoon. I 
therefore hastened into town. Matters could only be arranged by 
my borrowing £4 from Garthe, which will have to be returned. On 
Monday I shall write to Borchardt. To abandon the paper now 
would seem to me foolish on several counts: 1. because this would 
save the now foundering Gottfriedb ; 2. because after the King of 
Prussia's' death there will be radical changes in Germany, when 
we must have a paper of our own; 3. because of the growing 
number of subscribers (although for the time being this is simply a 
disadvantage financially, since the cost in STAMPS increases weekly 
while payments aren't due until the end of the quarter). The Volk 
already wields considerable influence in the United States. For 
instance the preface to my book d has been reprinted from the 
Volk and variously commented on by German papers from New 
England to California. 
You couldn't, I suppose, arrange to let me have your articlee by 
Wednesday, there being nothing 'topical' about it this time?

Might it be possible to raise some money from German business 
employees in Manchester through your cousin Siebel? 
I shall certainly succeed in getting some money out of Berlin 
and New York. But there's the next 6 to 8 weeks to be taken care 
of. 
As TO Freiligrath, just come and  TRY  extracting one shilling from 
him if you can! 
Incidentally, and between ourselves, we'd have done better over 
money if new deficits hadn't continually arisen as a result of 
renewed thefts. But these were perpetrated by the old agents. 
Beginning with Scherzer, I've thrown out all those who had 
compromised themselves. But what remained of the old leaven3 
wasn't any good and, even if these uncouth louts have been 
well-behaved hitherto, they blot their copybook when they make 
their exit. I finally threw out the last of them—Mr Lange —last 
week. It would have been relatively much easier to start up a 
completely new paper from scratch rather than, as Biskamp and 
Liebknecht did, continue, if only nominally, the existence of an 
organ that was rotten through and through. b 
Herewith a letter from Dana. 
Though I don't think much of his POETRY, could your RELATIVE 
Siebel do some little piece of verse for the Volk? But nothing 
sublime, please! So as to nettle Freiligrath, we simply must unearth 
some poet or other, even if we have to write the verse for him 
ourselves.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 26 August [1859] 
DEAR  Fred, 
'Das Volk' is no more. I had already advanced to Hollinger the £2 
you sent at the end of last week, for otherwise last Friday's issue (a 
week ago today) would not have come out. I have therefore paid it 
back to  myself.  In addition I owe Garthe £4 (for the paper) and 
ABOUT £2 more to Lessner, £6 in all. Moreover in Hollinger's case 
the deficit has accumulated—which doesn't, of course, concern us 
so immediately. However, it ought not to be allowed to grow any 
more. This can only be charged when the money for the 
subscriptions has come in. The French paper is not going to 
appear because of the amnesty. 465 
Borchardt, the braggart, wrote to say there was nothing doing in 
Manchester. First, because of the peace, then because of the 
amnesty. But more especially—and this was something he had not 
himself felt able to refute—because Das Volk was a scurrilous 
paper (oh, you idiot of a philistine!). I.e. not nice enough for the 
Steinthals and other such Ikeys. On the other hand a letter arrived 
at the same time from Lupus in which he spoke very highly of Das 
Volk. But the FACT is that as the paper improved, losses increased 
and readers fell off. Besides, that idiot Biskamp, with all sorts of 
people on at him, appeared to be jealous on account of his 
dwindling importance on the paper. 
Lastly, in view of Liebknecht's ineptitude and Biskamp's 
instability and weakness, it would have become increasingly 
necessary for me to intervene directly in the editorial work (for if 
sales were low among the louts, they were correspondingly high 
among the German diplomatic haute volée 3 in London). Distances 
being what they are here, the thing was in any case taking up too 
much of my time, and my own circumstances  ARE  IN SUCH  A DESPERATE 
STATE THAT I MUST LOOK TO THEM.

MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN LONDON 
London, 17 September 1859 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I should ere now have returned Blind's letter of 8th Sep­
tember,468 which you passed on to me, had not various passages 
therein made it necessary for me to take further steps to ascertain 
the facts of the case. 
In this letter Blind maintains that he had had 'nothing whatever to 
do with the problem in question' (i.e. with the public denunciation of 
Vogt).  He further maintains that 'the remarks' he made 'in the 
course of a private conversation...' 461 (implying that he's only spoken 
about Vogt 'in private') 'were completely misinterpreted'. The words 

=====第521页=====
279. Marx to Liebknecht. 17 September 1859 487 
'completely misinterpreted' are used with reference to  myself.  It 
was J who 'completely misinterpreted' Blind's 'remarks made in the 
course of a private conversation' and hence 'completely misrepresented' 
them to you and Biskamp. The misrepresentation in question is 
not witting, deliberate misrepresentation, but misrepresentation due 
either to the inherent difficulty of Blind's account, or to the 
feebleness and natural perversity of my powers of comprehension. 
As to which I would observe: 
1. Vogt was a tool used by Bonaparte to corrupt liberals in 
Germany and German revolutionaries abroad. Vogt further 
offered 30,000 gulden to a certain liberal writer in Germany in 
order to win him over in the interests of Bonapartist propagan­
da.—These two on-dit 3 were imparted to me IN THE MOST SERIOUS 
MANNER by Blind on 9 May, the day of Urquhart's first meeting. He 
imparted them to Freiligrath. He imparted them to others. He 
repeated, or rather reaffirmed, them in your presence, in Holling-
er's presence, in my presence, on the day we all three of us had  AN 
INTERVIEW with him. In regard to these two points, therefore, there 
can be no question of any interpretation, false or otherwise. They 
have been admitted. They can be proved by evidence. They are 
FACTS in so far as we consider Blind's statements as FACTS. 
2. Now as to Blind's 'interpretation'— minus the name Vogt qua 
agent of Bonapartist corruption, and minus the affair of the 
30,000 gulden—it is to be found in an article in the London Free 
Press dated 27 May with the heading: 'The Grand Duke 
Constantine to be King of Hungary'. Blind is the author of this 
article in which he says that *he 'knows the name of a Swiss 
Senator to whom he (Prince Jerome Napoleon) broached the 
subject'*, and even knows what Plon-Plon DID BROACH TO THE Swiss 
SENATOR; in which he further  * knows of 'the attempts made ... to 
win over to the Russo-Napoleonic scheme some of the exiled 
German Democrats, as well as some influential Liberals in 
Germany'*; in which he further KNOWS that *'large pecuniary 
advantages were held out to them as a bribe'*; and in which, 
finally, he is  * 'glad that these offers were rejected with indigna­
tion' *. This 'interpretation' is printed and did not therefore occur 
'in the course of a private conversation'. Again, it would seem from 
this that Blind, far from having had nothing to do with 'the 
problem', played the part of initiator. 
3. Add together 1. the facts related, and admitted to have been 
related, by Blind and 2. the 'interpretation' which Blind had 
a rumours 

=====第522页=====
488 279. Marx to Liebknecht. 17 September 1859 
printed and which is legally verifiable as such, and what do you 
get? 
The anonymous pamphlet Zur Warnung minus a few irrelevant 
phrases. Whether or not Blind composed this pamphlet is 
therefore completely immaterial. He is responsible for publishing the 
elements which go to make it up. 
He mentioned the name Vogt and the affair of the 30,000 
gulden 'in the course of a private conversation'. Not only with me 
but with Freiligrath and others. And not as a private and 
'confidential' matter but as political denunciation. He himself had 
the 'interpretation' relating to these two POINTS printed. 
It is quite immaterial, therefore, whether or not the pamphlet 
which subsequently came out was composed by him! All it contains 
is the sum total of verbal Blind and printed Blind. It is Blind 
added together. Hence it was not only / who regarded him as its 
author. Freiligrath did too. He even questioned him about it. 
Author or otherwise, it in no way alters the case. He is still the 
instigator responsible. 
You will recall that at the above-mentioned meeting he stated on 
his word of honour that he had not composed the pamphlet. 
Composing and writing are in effect two separate things. I now 
have documentary, legally valid evidence (which is at your disposal) to 
the effect that the pamphlet was printed by F. Hollinger, was 
handed to him by Blind, was written in Blind's  hand,  and was 
regarded by F. Hollinger as Blind's product.469 
What remains, then, is my interpretation, described not merely 
as a 'misinterpretation' but a 'complete misinterpretation'. 
As regards the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung, the relationship 
between myself and that paper has always been one of outright 
hostility. What is at issue in the law-suit that is to be heard in open 
court at Augsburg on the 28th of October 470 is not a QUARREL 
between the A. A. Z. and Vogt but a legal ruling on the 
relationship between the German ex-imperial regent 410 Vogt and 
the French EMPEROR Louis Bonaparte. In my view, then, what is at 
issue for every German revolutionary, even if not a member of a 
'Fatherland Association', 471 is not, in this instance, 'the affairs of a 
newspaper with which he had nothing whatever to do'; rather it is 
his own affair. That, however, is a matter of taste. De gustibus, etc. 3

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 21 September 1859 
Dear Engels, 
I have received your letter472 together with the enclosure. My 
domestic AFFAIRS, by the by, have again reached the inevitable point 
of crisis, worse this time than ever before, because I can't see any 
way out. A go at my brother-in-lawa ended IN NOTHING Freiligrath's 
business is WINDING  UP. Whether the Swiss will set up a new London 
agency, and for him, in 1860 is still in doubt. So he now has a 
better excuse than ever to refuse to handle any bill transactions. 
Dana has warned me about OVERDRAWING. Consequently I'm in a 
complete  FIX.  Apart from minor hazards (e.g. this week they are 
threatening to cut off the gas and water) the more considerable 
debts have all been mounting up and a substantial portion of these 
can no longer be put off. E.g. house, school, etc. 
As I shall have to write to Duncker shortly about the second 
instalment, let me know whether he has advertised the first 
instalment in the press. It seems to me that he would gladly let  THE 
WHOLE MATTER DROP. 
The damnable thing about it is that I no longer have a 
Bamberger in London. Otherwise I could certainly arrange a few 
ACCOMMODATION  BILLS  which I would subsequently pay with the money 
from America. In these CIRCUMSTANCES it can never be a question of 
anything  but  [MAKESHIFTS. 
You must forgive me for telling you this tale of woe. But down 
here there is absolutely no-one to whom I can freely unburden 
myself. 
As I've already told Lupus in my letter,474 you will both be 
hearing from me shortly about some odd political scandals.

Manchester, 22 September 1859 
Dear Moor, 
Lupus has just brought me your letter. I only got back the 
evening before last from a tour of Scotland with my parents" and 
have now packed them off home again. 
A day or two before my old man arrived I had the most 
damnable bit of bad luck. At a drunken gathering I was insulted 
by an Englishman11 I didn't know; I hit out at him with the 
umbrella I was carrying and the ferrule got him in the eye. The 
chap immediately put the matter in the hands of his LAWYER. I 
made the necessary counter-moves, and since his eye wasn't 
permanently damaged and he has now recovered, it at first 
seemed probable that the affair would be settled—though I would 
still be responsible for the costs. Now, however, the swine has 
suddenly done a volte-face and is threatening me with an ACTION; 
and if it came to that the thing would cost me over two hundred 
pounds, on top of which there would be a public scandal and a 
ROW with my old man, who would have to put up the money. 
However I still hope to get round the JOBBING  LAWYERS;  if all goes 
really well the DRUNKEN BRAWL will cost me forty or fifty pounds. The 
worst of it is that I'm completely in the hands of this swine and his 
SOLICITOR, can do nothing to force the issue and must put up with 
everything to avoid a scandal, otherwise the costs will be even 
heavier. Needless to say these blasted English don't want to 
deprive themselves of the pleasure of getting their hands on a 
BLOODY FOREIGNER. 
So this time my troubles have certainly not come singly. I simply 
don't know what to do until I can see how the business is going to 
turn out. My English acquaintances are behaving very honourably 
and instantly took the thing up, but I'm going to be bled, that's 
certain, and how much, heaven only knows. 
At all events I shall send you a five-pound note about Saturday 
or Monday to prevent the worst happening; meanwhile I can get it 
carried over to the October account. You may rest assured that I

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 23 September [1859] 
DEAR  Frederic, 
BAD  NEWS.  This time I'm in some doubt whether the business down 
here CAN  BE GOT OVER. There are very nasty difficulties in the way. 
I'm also in some doubt about your own affaire. Apart from the 
scandal—if the fellow's eye is better, if it can be proved that he 
OFFENDED you first and, further, that he had already agreed to your 
compromise, etc.—  I don't see that,under English law, there is very 
much he can do. In London you would at worst be fined £2-£5. It 
seems to me that the purpose of the whole thing is  TO  OBTAIN  MONEY 
ON FALSE PRETENCES. 
If the situation here is not to get any  worse,  I believe it essential 
that I should be able to send off 'Infantry' to Dana in ABOUT a week 
or' 10 days from now. Although he said 15 September it certainly 
won't be too late and in any case he must admit that we have 
shown good will. The main thing is that it should be not so much 
profound as prolix. 
If, immediately after your arrival in Manchester475 and after 
having made inquiries about the 'Englishman',11 you had departed 
again, for London, say, and made it known to the swine through a 
third party that you were on your way to the Continent, you would 
have been able to come to any arrangement you wanted. This 
might still be  possible  for, judging by Allen, etc., all Englishmen now 
believe that there will be a GENERAL  AMNESTY  47fi on the Continent and

IN LONDON 
Manchester, 7 Southgate 
[between 24 and 26 September 1859] 
Dear Moor, 
Enclosed fiver B/B 95281 Manchester, 1 January 1859. 
Shall deal with the other matters very shortly. 
For the present just one more point to which an answer is 
required by return if possible. 
1. How much money is needed to return to those subscribers to 
the Volk who have paid direct, the few pence due to them in 
respect of undelivered copies? 
2. What arrangement was made about this with Thimm and 
others? Have the booksellers deducted what was not delivered,  OR 
HOW? Or not paid at all yet? 
I must have clarification of these matters, if possible at  once,  and 
I shall, if possible, raise the money—it can't amount to much—to 
settle the sorry business of the direct subscribers. Up here the 
bourgeois are complaining like mad that they've been cheated, and 
Lupus and I have to swallow it all. So let me have an answer at 
once.  The day before yesterday Lupus was involved in a row on 
this account and I shall have to see the 'third party' as soon as 
possible. 
'Infantry' is in hand and if at all possible I shall finish it before 
the week is out.

284. Marx to Szemere. 26 September 1859 493 
As to my own affair up here, surely you don't imagine that I, 
for my part, didn't also have SENSE enough to hand the thing over 
to a LAWYER and listen to his opinion. It's not a case of some 
miserable fine imposed by a magistrate but of an ACTION  AT NISI  PRIUS 
FOR DAMAGES,  in which the costs alone could be as high as £200. You 
surely don't imagine that I shall let myself be swindled like this 
without lifting a finger; as to running away, I need hardly say 
that, my circumstances being what they are, there can be no 
question of it, even for a fortnight; and being as well known in 
Manchester as I am, no one here would imagine that I would run 
away from the firm, etc., in order to escape a lawsuit of this sort. 
The real joke is that the use of pretty well any instrument gives 
a LAWYER a HANDLE with which to sway a BRITISH JURY, namely moral 
indignation at BLOODY FOREIGNERS who don't use their fists, etc. In 
which case the verdict goes against the FOREIGNER as sure as 2x2=4, 
and on top of that he has to fork out the costs. Anyway you can 
count on it that I shall fork out no more than is absolutely 
necessary. As yet the affair hasn't progressed an inch but I hope it 
will soon be settled so that I may at least get a clear idea of what 
can be done to help you through the crisis. 
Many regards to your wife and the girls.

In reply to your letter d.d. Sept. 23 I beg to state: 1) On the 
arrival at London of the N. Y. T. containing P's declaration, 
which to sign with his name he had not dared," I sent the

N. Y. T. two letters with a full Statement of the case. Simultane­
ously, I addressed a private note to the Editor in which I insisted 
upon the necessity of exposing the manoeuvres and intrigues of 
the wide-mouthed charlatan. 479 We shall, by and by, ascertain, whether 
or not my letters were published by the N. Y. T.a 
As to the great London Daily Papers, it is quite out of the 
question to induce them to give publicity to a full exposure of 
Kossuth. The statement, in the first instance, would imply a libel 
case, which to stand the editors are, or at least affect to be, afraid 
of, considering the difficulty to prove such charges of bribery, and 
to summon the witnesses before a British tribunal. In the second 
instance, Kossuth is too unmitigated a humbug to not share the 
secret sympathies of the venal London press-gang. I have, however, 
put down a summary for the 'Free Press' (the Urquhartite paper 
which appears on the last Wednesday of every month)b I have 
authorised them, if they think it necessary, 'to dress the salad' in 
their own style, and I think myself warranted in supposing that 
the 'thing' is to come out this very week. In that case I shall 
forward you a copy. Although circulated among a very exclusive 
public, the Free Press finds its way to all the cabinets and capitals 
of Europe. It is well known at Constantinople. Besides, the 
statement having once appeared in the Free Press, some London 
correspondents, connected with the German press, and more or 
less influenced by me, will find it easier to transplant the thing to 
the Teutonic soil. 
I enclose Asboth's declaration from the N. Y. T.c The turn now 
given to K's proceedings is, that that 'illustrious' patriot attempted 
only to prevent 'a premature rising in Hungary', and that the 
clever 'statesman' altogether^succeeded in this 'difficult' task. 
Some time ago, Urquhart had his correspondence with Kossuth 
(which I alluded to, as you will recollect) translated into Italian, 
and copiously distributed throughout Italy.d 
2) In regard to the wine-affair, I became informed, soon after your 
departure from London, that my brother-in-lawe was not to return 
to Amsterdam before October. I have, therefore, not yet written to 
him on the business. 
For England I have till now vacillated between two men, both of 
whom, though in different ways, appear fit for undertaking the

task. The one is a German, without capital, but very energetical, 
speculative, and industrious. The other is an Englishman, who 
deals in French and German wines, a 'respectable' merchant, 
although no large one. At all events, he has contrived to get on 
with his wine-business and to rise, in the short period of 6-7 years, 
from very small beginnings to comparative affluency. The former 
candidate would have been exclusively given to the business in 
question; the latter has the advantage of greater means, a settled 
concern, and established connexions. If, as will be decided in a few 
days,  the German is, for the present, not yet ready to enter on the 
affair (and I have reason to think so), I shall make a conditional 
offer to the Englishman. You will then be informed of his 
conditions and may decide  yourself.

Dear Engels, 
Yesterday evening I had a visit from Lessner, whom I had sent for 
in connection with the Manchester subscribers to the Volk. 
Like Biskamp, he assures me that (apart from Lupus) there 
wasn't a single direct subscriber to the Volk. And up till now no 
one has sent a FARTHING to London. 
After the Volk ceased publication Thimm wrote to Lessner 
asking for an account. Lessner replied that he could send him an 
account only in respect of the period in which he, Lessner, had 
been despatch clerk. He then sent him an invoice for the 
individual numbers. Up till yesterday there had been no reply from 
Thimm.

Dear Lassalle, 
It is very good of you to be the first to take up the pen again, 
and this in a matter touching my interests, despite the fact that 
appearances speak against me. 
As for my silence, let me say briefly: 
First, I didn't get either of your letters until weeks after their 
despatch, namely on my return to London from a journey to 
Scotland via Manchester, made for business reasons.444 Meanwhile 

=====第532页=====
498 287.  Marx  to Lassalle.  Not before  2 October  1859 
events  had  moved  so fast that they  had, as it  were, removed  the 
point  of our  debate.3  For the  POINT  IN QUESTION  did not  relate—nor, 
between  you and me,  could  it have related—to  the  nationalities 
issue,  but  rather  to the  most suitable policy  to be  pursued  by the 
German revolutionaries towards their  own  governments  and  other 
countries.  Now I  would nevertheless have sent  a reply,  if a  belated 
one, had  there  not  been fresh grounds  for  delay.  In one of  your 
letters  you  asked  for  evidence relating  to Vogt. That evidence  was 
in the  hands  of Karl Blind.  The  'worthy democrat', however, 
though privately inclined  to play  at moral indignation  as well  as 
stir up scandal, resisted  all expostulations  TO COME OUT. Consequendy 
I broke with  him. (He  even denied authorship  of Zur Warnung, 
the anonymous pamphlet published  in London 461 and  reproduced 
in the  Augsburger.h However,  I have succeeded  in obtaining 
documentary evidence against  him  (Blind)  in this matter,469  to 
which  I shall revert  'at the  right time  and the  right place'.) This 
provided  a fresh occasion  for  prolonging  my  silence.  And,  since 
'the evil deed  is accursed  in that  it must constantly engender evil'c 
my silence itself became  an obstacle  to my  breaking  it. On top of 
that—and  I beg you not to  regard this simply  as a  figure  of 
speech—there  was a  whole series  of domestic complications,  as yet 
by no means eliminated, which  in fact robbed  me of all  desire  to 
write.  So much  for my  silence, which, however,  and  despite  all 
APPEARANCES  TO THE  CONTRARY,  was in no way motivated by ill-will. 
Now  as to  Duncker, 
on my  return  to London  I found  a letter from  him  which 
apparently rendered  it impossible  for me to  make  any  further 
direct approach  to the man  regarding  the  sequel.478  On the  other 
hand,  not  having written  to you for so  long,  I couldn't possibly 
start off by  suddenly writing  to you  about  my own  concerns.  So I 
let the  matter  DROP,  on the  tacit assumption that,  if I  hadn't heard 
from Duncker  by a  certain date,  I should have  to approach 
another publisher. 
However,  one of  your earlier letters  led me to  suppose that 
Duncker  had  undertaken  to publish  2 instalments,  or rather  the 
first section ('Capital  in General')  in its  entirety.d  But on the  other 
hand  the  first instalmente  was  much more compendious than  had

been originally planned, nor, for that matter, did I want him to be 
a 'publisher malgré lui 3'. However, since the first 2 instalments 
form a whole, it would be desirable for them at least to appear 
under the same imprint. 
I shall now be obliged to remodel the thing completely, as the 
manuscript for this second instalment is already a year old250; and, 
since my circumstances do not permit me to devote much time to 
the matter just now, I hardly think I shall be able to finish it 
before the end of December. That, however, would be at the very 
outside. 
I am busy with an English rendering of the first instalment and 
this, too, has been disrupted by a bad domestic spell. At any rate I 
am assured of a better reception in England than in Germany 
where, so far as I am aware, nobody inquires after the thing or 
gives a straw for it. All I want is to place the whole of this first 
section, at least, before the German public. Should the latter 
continue to pay no heed to the work, I intend to put all 
subsequent sections straight into English and no longer concern 
myself with the German philistines.

Because of sundry interruptions and an (otherwise insignificant)

My quarrel not settled yet and might still be damnably

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 5 October [1859] 
Dear Engels, 
In view of the way things are managed here (Speck has gone 
bankrupt and disappeared; Garthe, the cashier, is in Brighton) 
and always have been managed so far as the Volk is concerned, it 
is impossible to obtain an accurate account AS TO FOREIGN  [out-of-
town] SUBSCRIBERS during the pre-Lessner period. Biskamp maintains 
that, with the exception of the very first issues, Thimm was always 
sent a dozen copies. 
Hollinger is suing me for £12 and a couple of shillings arrears 
in respect of Das Volk, together with the type for the last issue, 
which did not appear. The dirty dog is trying to make out all of a 
sudden that I'm the 'proprietor', although the whole business, I 
won't say foundered (for your philistine here is a hopeless 
proposition), but closed down with a deficit because I wasn't the 
proprietor and was unable to knock the slipshod management into 
shape despite all the time I spent on it. Still less did I ever give the 
chap a legal guarantee. I think his account is wrong, for apart 
from the other moneys received, the fellow had had £7 from me 
for the 3 penultimate issues alone (his account covers the last 2 
issues).—The 15/- for Lessner did not go through his hands but 
was paid direct by me.—However, I'm not going to engage in any 
controversy on the subject since I would thereby immediately 
acknowledge his right to sue me. The dirty dog will swear on oath 
and get one of his type-setters to swear on oath that I gave a 
guarantee. (Even were this the case he should have sued Biskamp 
first.) I shall call in Biskamp, etc., to give counter-evidence. Had I 
the means, I should have avoided all public proceedings, not by 
paying Hollinger, but by buying the debt he incurred with one 
Lisle, Hollinger's LANDLORD and owner of the press. Hollinger owes 
this man some £60 and has never paid him a FARTHING. 
But circumstances being what they are, there can be no question 
of anything of the kind. 
Unless I bring off some sort of coup—and I simply cannot see 
how I can do so—my position will become completely untenable. 
Freiligrath made another attempt at negotiating a bill. But

yesterday evening, at the same time as threatening letters from the 
LANDLORD, etc., etc., a letter arrived from him saying it was definitely 
no go. The enclosed letter from Lassalle, which I answered by 
return, 3 looks like good news to me. The thingb  appears to be 
selling despite the conspiration de silence. Otherwise I wouldn't have 
received this indirect request from Duncker. I shall, by the by, be 
totally incapable of going on with the thing 473 until I've CLEARED up 
the worst of the domestic mess d'une manière ou d'une autre. 0 Your 
articles on my affair d have been reprinted in German papers from 
New York to California (with the tiny little Volk we hooked the 
whole of the German-American press). To show you the kind of 
rubbish that's appearing in Germany, I enclose a cutting of the 
advertisements in the Vienna Presse. Il suffit"  TO READ  the index. (By 
THE BY, I am giving lectures about the first instalment to a  select  circle 
of artisans.' It seems to interest the chaps a great deal. 483) 
Lastly, a report on two 'great men'.367 
Ad vocem* R. Schramm. Some while ago this pitiful blockhead 
was in Ostend, whence he sent a contribution to the Hermann.*1 
Not that I'm in the habit of reading that trashy sheet; I heard 
about this through Freiligrath. In his contribution R. Schramm 
declares that one could gauge the depths to which the Germans 
had sunk simply by listening to their conversations on the beach. 
Thus he had, for instance, overheard two ladies chattering away in 
broad Wuppertal accents and one of them had addressed the 
other as 'Mrs Engels'. So that's the kind of revenge this wretch 
takes!  But by way of retribution the blockhead recently lost £2,000 
(teste' Freiligrath), having, like a fool, entered the 'precious stones 
business'. This had, moreover, frustrated his scheme of starting a 
German paper of his own in London (was to have come out this 
month). To the chap's intense annoyance and as a riposte to his 
childish MALICE, I got Biskamp to see that the  FACTS—non­
appearance of the paper, gem trade and loss of money—were 
published in the Weser-Zeitung. 
Ad vocem K.  Blind.  With regard to this homme d'état, I must go 
into greater detail. 
About a fortnight after my return to London from Manchester, 
Biskamp told me that Blind had proposed, through Hollinger,

that I, and the communist element generally, must go. In our 
stead—sensible socialism. At that time I had, as you know, written 
nothing for the Volk save for a pleasantry or two. a However, I 
forthwith wrote Blind, not a letter, but a communication of  ABOUT  IO 
LINES484  in which I called him amongst other things an 'homme 
d'état' and an 'important man', and alluded to his henchman 
'Fidelio' b (i.e. Hollinger). Next day along comes Liebknecht, and 
tells me that Blind and Hollinger are sitting in the pub on the 
corner. The former, he said, was expecting me. I therefore went 
there with Liebknecht. Blind gave his word of honour that there 
was nothing in the thing. That swine Hollinger ditto. Hence I 
could only believe them. However, the meeting gave me a chance 
of finding out about other machinations of Blind's. Inter alia, the 
conversation came round to Vogt. Blind assured me on his word of 
honour (as he had already assured Freiligrath, though omitting his 
word of honour) that he had neither written the anonymous Zur 
Warnung nor launched it upon the world. I said this surprised me, 
since it contained no more than what he had told me by word of 
mouth on the occasion of Urquhart's meeting on 9 May. 461 I 
reminded him that he had assured me at the time that he 
possessed tangible evidence, knew the name of the man to whom 
Vogt had offered 30,000 or 40,000 gulden, but 'unfortunately' could 
not divulge it, etc. Well, Blind hadn't the face to deny this but 
expressly admitted it more than once in Liebknecht's and 
Hollinger's presence. 
WELL!  A few weeks ago the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung wrote 
to Liebknecht, who had sent them Zur Warnung. Liebknecht came 
to me. 470 I told him to go and find Blind, and that I should await 
the homme d'état 'in the pub at Blind's corner'. Blind was at some 
resort—St. Leonard's, I think. Liebknecht wrote to him; wrote 
once,  twice. At last a letter from the homme d'état. In the coolest 
and most 'diplomatic' manner the latter regretted that T should 
have called to see him in vain. Liebknecht, he went on, must 
understand that he (Blind) had no desire to intervene in the 
affairs of a 'paper with which he had absolutely nothing to do' and 
in a matter with which he had absolutely nothing to do. As for 
Liebknecht's allusions to 'remarks' let fall 'in the course of a 
private conversation', these could only be attributed to a 'complete' 
misunderstanding. And that, or so the 'homme d'état' imagined, was 
that.

Press'.  - b Fidelio—the assumed name of Leonore, heroine of Beethoven's opera 
Fidelio.

I now took Liebknecht with me to Collet. I recalled that The Free 
Press of 27 May ('The Grand Duke Constantine', 440 etc., p. 53) 
had contained a paragraph which I immediately suspected to be 
Blind's handiwork and which, taken in conjunction with Blind's 
verbal admissions before Liebknecht, Hollinger and myself, 
constituted the entire contents of the anonymous pamphlet, 
besides providing proof that it was not just en passant, in the course 
of a 'private conversation', that Blind had touched on this 'matter 
with which he had absolutely nothing to do'. Hence to Collet, who 
instantly declared Blind to be the AUTHOR. He still had Blind's letter 
in which the latter had enclosed his card but had asked that his 
name should not be disclosed. This was convincing evidence. 
By a series of manoeuvres which it would take too long to 
describe here, I further extracted the enclosed (which you must let 
me have back by return. I have also shown it to Freiligrath). So much 
for the respectable citizen's 'word of honour'! 
Well, last Saturday Liebknecht sent the homme d'état a letter 
(modelled on a letter from myself to Liebknecht in which I had 
summed the matter up in somewhat forceful terms 3). We are 
awaiting the answer and will let you know the details.

My dear Franck,

altogether a mistake.

1) On Thursday (Sept. 29), I sent you a copy of the London Free 
Press d.d. 28 Sept., containing a statement headed: Particulars of 
K's Transaction with L. N. On the very day of its issue that number 
of the F. P. was forwarded to all the newspaper offices of 
London. The Times published its article in K's favour3 only after 
having made sure from the F. P., that K. is as venal a fellow as the 
Times writers. 
For the case of the number of the F. P., sent to you, having 
been intercepted by the French Post-Office, I enclose the article 
above said in this letter. 
2) The statement of the F. P. has been reprinted in English, 
Scotch and Irish provincial papers. A literal translation of it has, 
by friends of mine, been inserted in the Augsburg Allgemeine 
Zeitung 6 and the Bremer Weserzeitung. Another German transla­
tion is said to have appeared in the Berlin 'Nationalzeitung'. 
3) Simultaneously with your letter, I received to-day the New 
York Tribune d.d. September 24 which, under the title 'K. and 
L. N.', brings an elaborate article of mine, filling two and a half 
columns, and put forward in a prominent place of the paper. The 
Tribune having always had a faiblec for K., and P. being its 
London correspondent, this publication is a real success, the more 
so, since P. is nominally denounced in the article, and the 
apologetical passages of his own letter to the New Y. T.d  are 
ridiculed. There exist at least some hundred smaller American 
papers, published in the English language, which receive their mot 
d'ordre* from the Tribune, and, consequendy, will reprint that 
article. The German American press, from New York to San 
Francisco, will, by this time, have translated the article into the 
Teutonic vernacular. 
Moreover, it should not be forgotten that New York is the 
centre of the Hungarian emigration in America. 
If you [should] be unable to get the Tribune d.d. Sept. 24., I 
shall send you the article on the condition of your remitting it, since I 
possess no other copy, and stand in need of it should it be replied 
to by P. 
4) K's letter to Mac Adam,f on which the Times leader remarks, 
has been generally ridiculed by the London papers, so much so

that K. induced that same Mac Adam to declare in the same 
papers, that the letter was a private letter and not meant for 
publication.3 As a specimen, of the manner in which K's letter was 
handled, I enclose a leader from the London Daily Telegraph. 
5) If you can forward me any further particulars on K's 
proclamations and intrigues in Hungary, they will be very 
welcome, and are sure to find their way into the Press. 
6) My stationer was unable to get the Times' copies you ask for. 
Generally, some days after their issue, London Daily papers are 
difficult of procuring. 
7) The remark on Perczel in the F. P. article is based on a public 
declaration of his. I thought fit to allude to it, in order to throw 
confusion into the ranks of K's partisans as to the source from 
which the information proceeds. 
8) From the note enclosed, you will see that the English 
merchant, on further consideration, declines entering upon the 
wine-affair. The German, I spoke of, has returned to the 
Continent. Thus I see no prospect of pushing on this affair in 
England. 
As to my brother-in-law,b I have written to him, but not yet 
received his answer.

Collet came  to see me  yesterday. Statesman Blind  had  called  on 
him and  complained forcefully about  his  (Collet's) having failed  to 
preserve editorial secrecy vis-à-vis myself.  He  (Collet) must call  on 
me to  prevent  my  doing  any  more  MISCHIEF.  The  Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung was 'A RUSSIAN  (!)  ORGAN',  which was why he 
(Blind) would  not  hold  out a  helping hand  to it. 470 To me,  Collet 
said:  *'At the  outset,  he  made upon  me the  impression  of a  very 
sneakish fellow.' * Statesman Blind, like  the  gentleman  he is, has not 
deigned  to answer Liebknecht,  and  imagines he's been able  to spike 
my guns through Collet.  THE  FOOL!  At the  same time  he  tried  to 
get Collet  to tell him who had  written about Kossuth  in the  [Free]

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 26 October 1859 
Dear Engels, 
I trust that you aren't ill or that some other misfortune hasn't 
befallen you, but would beg you, whatever the case,  TO DROP SOME 
LINES  since your protracted silence" worries me. 
Do please return me the cutting from the Tribune3 which I 
enclosed in my last. 
Duncker has now definitely declared himself willing to bring out 
the second instalment.473  Lassalle speaks of his 'Italian' tactics quasi 
re bene gesta b and, in the course of pressing me to make a 
statement, lets fall the modest hope that perhaps I have revised 
'my' opinion.485 
The Kinkel or Schiller festival here, a festival, by the by, that 
will turn out to be an altogether wretched affair, is something 
Freiligrath, 'as a German poet', could not but associate himself 
with, though I warned him that he was required simply as an 
accessory to Gottfried. 486 
As regards the Volk I have avoided the COUNTY COURT  PROCESS 0 by 
sacrificing  ABOUT  £5 while, on the other hand, getting Hollinger to 
recognise Biskamp as  PROPRIETOR  on the receipt; he (Biskamp) is 
therefore responsible for the balance, but since he possesses no 
property whatsoever, he is absolved of any further liability. This 
step—a highly unpleasant one under the  ACTUAL  CIRCUMSTANCES—had 
to be taken because Kinkel's gang was only waiting for the case 
in order to raise a public scandal, and not one of the 
paper's hangers-on was presentable enough to be exhibited in 
court. 
At the request  (ENCOMPASSED  in two very plaintive, abject letters) of 
the Augsburger Zeitung I sent them the document relating to 
Blind. 48 It served the laddie right, the more so because he went to 
Collet and 1. tried to make use of him for sundry subterfuges, 2. 
denounced Liebknecht to Collet as  'BELONGING  TO THE  COMMUNIST  PARTY'

[...] The  Blind affair  is  very funny indeed;  it's  always  a 
particularly agreeable spectacle when  a would-be diplomatic 
wiseacre comes  a cropper.  The  fellow could  be terribly discredited 
as a result. Needless  to say he  gave  his  'word  of honour' simply IN 
THE DIPLOMATIC SENSE OF THE WORD,  just as it is no insult to call someone 
a swine  IN A  PARLIAMENTARY  sENSE. b This enrichment  of the  language  by 
Blind  is worthy  of recognition. What would  be nicest  of all, by the 
way, would  be to  discover that  Mr  Blind's 'evidence'  had no  basis 
other than  hot air  which, this sinister saviour  of his  country being 
what  he is, I  think highly probable. 
Lupus  is in  despair over  the  deterioration  of BITTER BEER,  which  is

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London,] 3 November 1859 
Dear Frederick, 
Lessner hasn't got the names of the people to whom Das Volk 
was sent. All he knows is the number of copies (12) which he 
regularly despatched to Thimm. 
Biskamp maintains that the books he ordered from Thimm 
were not for his own account but for that of the parson who 
employed him as a schoolmaster. Nor, come to that, had Thimm 
ever said a word about the matter. He will be writing to him about 
it, likewise about Panzer's acquisitive propensities. A few days ago 
he was taken on by the Weser-Zeituns at 50 talers a month. 
My work is making poor progress. 3 I'm plagued by too many 
domestic disruptions and too many worries. You'll have heard 
about the 'grand' Schiller festival here.486  Freiligrath and Kinkel, 
or rather Kinkel and Freiligrath, are to be its heroes. Seeing that 
the whole thing emanated from the Kinkel clique here and that 
even the invitations to form a committee were sent out by that 
wretch Beta, Gottfried's factotum, I wrote to Freiligrath weeks ago 
saying I hoped  HE  WOULD  KEEP  ALOOF  FROM  THE  KINKEL  DEMONSTRATION. 488 In 
reply I received a not exactly unequivocal letter from the fat 
philistine in which, inter alia, he said: 
'Even should Kinkel secure Briseis in the shape of the festive address, this 
would be no reason for Achilles to withdraw sulking into his tent.' 

=====第546页=====
512 295. Marx to Engels. 3 November 1859 
So Kinkel is Agamemnon and Freiligrath Achilles 3! Moreover, 
he says that the festival 'is relevant in more ways than one' (in what 
ways we shall presently see), and finally that he has written a 
poem on Schiller b commissioned by the city of Boston (United 
States). 
Later I discovered from the Hermann that Freiligrath was acting 
as a member of the committee and that there was some talk of his 
having written a cantata on Schiller (set to music by Pauer)c; in 
other words, that the philistine had kept something back from me. 
Later still I got another letter from him in which he said I would 
seem to have been right after all, though his participation had 
partially frustrated Gottfried's plans. 
Well, when I saw the man he told me with bated breath about 
all that had happened. Beta and Juch, Kinkel's agents, had heard 
from America that Freiligrath had written the poem on Schiller 
for Boston. Gottfried had, besides the address, reserved the festive 
cantata for  himself.  Believing, however, that non bis in idem, d and 
that it wouldn't be feasible to co-opt Freiligrath without conceding, 
or rather offering, him the poetic part (though they counted on 
his turning down the offer), Juch and Beta invited Freiligrath, on 
behalf of Kinkel's committee, to join that committee and write the 
cantata. Freiligrath said he had already composed a poem for 
Boston, gave an inconclusive reply but promised to serve on the 
committee. This last treated the matter as a mere formality and 
did not renew its request. Freiligrath, however, hastily sets to work 
(no such difficulties here as in the case of the Volk for which he 
never could manage as much as 3 lines), writes a cantata (in the 
same metre as Schiller's dithyrambs'; he read me the stuff—pomp 
and circumstance), hurries to Pauer, has it set to music and, 
through his friends in the Schiller festival choir, compels Kinkel 
and Co. to renew their invitation to him. Then he sends them the 
rubbish which, 'by an anachronism', happened to be already 
finished and complete, not only written but actually set to music, 
and likens himself at the end of his epistle to a 'menial' who has 
served his 'master' without waiting for orders (Messrs Kinkel, Beta, 
Juch and Co.)! (And it's the philistine himself who tells me 
this.) 
a In Homer's Iliad Agamemnon and Achilles quarrelled for the possession of Briseis, 
the captive queen of Lyrnessus. - b  Here and below Marx refers to Freiligrath's 
poems 'Zur Schillerfeier. 10.November 1859' which are subtitled 'Festlied der 
Deutschen in Amerika' and 'Festlied der Deutschen in London'. - c 'Die Sitzungen 
des Schiller-Comité's', Hermann, No. 43, 29 October 1859. - d the same thing must 
not be done twice (from Roman law) - e F. Schiller, 'Dithyrambe'. 

=====第547页=====
295. Marx to Engels. 3 November 1859 513 
However the 'tension' between him and Gottfried was not yet at 
an end. Freiligrath attended the committee, where Gottfried 
behaved very coolly towards him. Now Freiligrath—'quite fortuit­
ously' or so he says—had introduced into his cantata a passage 
during which it was 'essential' for Schiller's bust to be unveiled. 
Gottfried, no less fortuitously, had arranged for the climax of his 
sermon to coincide with the 'moment of unveiling'. After a 
prolonged tussle, throughout which philistine Freiligrath sat in 
silence and let his friends (riff-raff of all kinds) do the talking, it 
was at length decided that the 'unveiling' should fall to Freiligrath, 
whereupon Gottfried, sighing heavily, declared that in that case he 
would now be obliged to address his entire oration to 'the veiled 
portrait'. Whereupon one of Freiligrath's pals rose to his feet and 
said that this difficulty could be overcome if Kinkel were to make 
his speech after the cantata. Gottfried, however, voiced his 
unqualified opposition to this, declaring with the utmost indigna­
tion that 'he had already made so many concessions over the affair 
that this could not possibly be demanded of him'. And that was 
the end of that. So the sermon will come first. 
And Freiligrath told me all this rubbish with great seriousness 
and gravity; on the other hand he finds it perfectly natural that he 
should never have breathed a word to the committee about the 
Kinkel gang's having taken it for granted that his (Freiligrath's) 
supposed 'party friends' should not be invited to join the 
committee, thus making a Kinkel demonstration of it. Though he 
knew perfectly well that I wouldn't attend, he should never have 
permitted such 'ostracism' on the part of a committee on which he 
himself sits. Blind is on it, of course. 
Ever since his poem about the Mockel woman,3  Freiligrath has 
treated us 'strictly in private' as his friends while openly walking 
arm-in-arm with our enemies. Qui vivra verra} 
Ad vocemc  Blind:  The scoundrel has now been to see Hollinger. 
For the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung had written to him saying 
that, if he persisted in his reticence, he would be brought out into 
the open in the most unpleasant manner, and that they possessed 
a document incriminating him. 487 He accused Hollinger of having 
let the cat out of the bag. Hollinger, with justice, said quod nond 
and asked why Blind refused to admit responsibility for it. The 
latter told him that, while he had indeed written the manuscript, a 
friend of his had composed it. The fact of the matter is that while 
Blind wrote and composed it, Goegg supplied the most inculpating 
a F. Freiligrath, 'Nach Johanna Kinkels Begräbnis'. - b He who survives will see.

bits. Now the respectable Goegg is 'apparendy' Vogt's friend, as he 
needs must be since Fazy, through the Swiss bank, owns shares 
worth 25,000 frs in his looking-glass factory and generally serves 
him as BANKER. Hence Goegg's indignation at the act of 'high 
treason' can only be ventilated sotto voce. Such are the 'serious 
republicans'.

Freiligrath really deserves to be severely chastised for once and I 
hope that an opportunity will present itself before the Schiller 
nonsense is over (or its after-pains). 486 Such poet's vanity and 
literary presumption combined with toadyism is altogether too 
much, and on top of that the Augsburgerb credits him with political 
virtue! 
I suppose you read about Vogt's law-suit470  in the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 297 et seq. c? The thing went quite well, but 
Biskamp's letter is shockingly discreditable. The fellow could

perfectly well have dealt with his private affairs in a separate note 
but, as things are, it is exceedingly distasteful that the editor of the 
Volk should send the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung a testimonial, 
begging to be taken on as correspondent, and that this should 
appear in print." Vogt will make a great noise about it. Why do we 
always have such tactless idiots hanging round us? 
But most satisfactory is the discrediting of Blind. The statement 
in your letterb and the document487 have now obliged the worthy 
diplomat to come creeping out into the open, if only to save 
himself being discredited still further. He has boasted about the 
evidence he possesses and, if he holds his tongue, will seem an 
unmitigated liar. 
Vogt is in no less nice a mess. Case dismissed for lack of 
jurisdiction, ordered to pay all the costs, and referred to a 
jury—what can he do? 
He will have to sue either the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung 
before a Bavarian jury—in which case he will be doomed in 
advance—or the Volk—and then Blind will be  SUBPOENAED—or  else 
Blind  himself.  In any case, it will turn out badly for him, and I 
don't see how he can do anything but discredit himself still more. 
All this is most consoling. 
Garibaldi would seem to be playing a somewhat ambiguous role. 
A general of that ilk is in a difficult position. Once he had been 
forced to compound with the devil, there was no turning back. For 
Victor Emmanuel the obvious thing is, of course, first to exploit 
Garibaldi and then ruin him. Altro esempioc of how far you get 
with a 'practical attitude' in a revolution. It's a pity about the chap, 
though. Excellent, on the other hand, that Piedmont should lose 
its spurious character as representative of Italian unity.489 
I shall do you an article about army reform in Germany when 
this affair has progressed a little further. Far-reaching things are 
happening in the sphere of military organisation, not only in 
Prussia but elsewhere, in Austria, etc. Everywhere the French style 
of uniform, etc., is being adopted, and in many respects this even 
means quite definitely putting the clock back. But so far 
everything's still rather confused; as soon as I can clarify my ideas 
a little I'll do the article for you.d 
I also hope that soon there'll be something further for me to 
report on in China and the Far East  GENERALLY.  Likewise Morocco.490 
a Biskamp's letter, dated 20 October 1859, was published in the Allgemeine Zeitung, 
No. 300, on 27 October 1859. - b to the Editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung - c Another

perhaps, let me have some political information ad vocemb  Pam on 
the subject so that I am au fait 
At the moment I'm deep in Ulfilas.491 It was really high time for 
me to polish off that damned Gothic, which I'd always been so 
desultory about. To my surprise I find I know far more than I 
thought; if only I can get hold of another reference book, I think 
I shall polish this off completely in a fortnight. Then I shall go on 
to Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon, with which I've never been on 
more than nodding terms. So far, I've been working without a 
dictionary or other reference book save the Gothic text and 
Grimm.0 However, that old fellow is really splendid. 
What I need badly here is Grimm's Geschichte der deutschen 
Sprache. Could you let me have it back? 
I think I shall see Lupus this evening. 
We are having a Schiller festival up here too (programme 
enclosed). Needless to say, I have nothing whatever to do with the 
thing. Mr Alfr. Meissner is sending a prologue, and Siebel will do 
the epilogue, straightforward recitation, of course, but done in 
proper form. In addition, this flâneur is producing a performance 
of 'Wallensteins Lager' d; I've been to two of the rehearsals and, if 
the chaps keep their nerve, it might be quite passable. The 
committee members are, without exception, a bunch of fools; 
among the public Borchardt plays at being in opposition. He's no 
less negatively pompous than the others are positively so, except 
that his negation is based on the same point of view as the position 
of the others, i.e. he admits that he is essentially one of their 
number.

ENGELS TO JENNY MARX* 
IN LONDON 
Manchester, 5 November 1859 
Dear Mrs Marx, 
I must really beg you to forgive me for having been so 
shockingly remiss that Moor finally had to get you to extract the 
article in questionb from me. However, I had no idea that it was 
needed for anything except staving off possible ructions on Mr 
Pulszky's part and hence was in no hurry at all about returning it.c 
But this time it really is enclosed. 
Freiligrath, the fat philistine, is really behaving in a most 
disgraceful way and deserves to be well and truly chastised, for 
which an opportunity will, I trust, soon present  itself.  Most 
amusing is the Trojan War over the momentous question as to 
who should have the cantata and who the festive speech, and 
which is to come first, the speech or the cantata.d The philistines 
up here are greatly vexed by Lupus' and my refusal to get mixed 
up in the Schiller do. Only yesterday evening I had another 
sparring match with three enthusiastic Schillerians. These folk are 
quite unable to comprehend how anyone could fail to jump at 
such a beautiful opportunity for self-advertisement. They want to 
found a 'Schiller Institute'4  2 here, i.e. a German club in which to 
read, eat, drink, hold lectures, do gymnastics, act plays, make 
music and goodness knows what else. Borchardt was silly enough 
to attend the preliminary meeting and to speak against it (he 
urged me to go too but for that very reason I stayed away) and 
when it was put to the vote, Hoyoll the crippled painter and one 
other man voted with him, and Borchardt, of course, suffered a 
spectacular defeat. Subsequently he subscribed £4 10/- to the 
thing, which makes him a member for 3 years. You have no idea 
what German erudition has suddenly come to light here on this 
occasion. There's a Dr Götze, a Dr Marcus, a Dr Dolch, a Dr 
Samelson, all fellows of whom one had never heard before. These 
and a few aesthetic Jews have taken charge of the whole thing, 
and once again erudition plays mentor to the Jews—save in the

case of Samelson, he's a doctor who, for the past four years, has 
'quite recently settled in Manchester'. Nothing but  self-
advertisement and tittle-tattle, and they actually expect one to take 
part in it. 
For that matter, I myself am indulging in tittle-tattle, as you see, 
and hence it would be best for me to break off altogether. Please 
give my warmest regards to the girls, and do not forget Moor.

IN BERLIN 
London, 6 November 1859 
Dear Lassalle, 
You'd have had a reply from me sooner if my spare time hadn't 
been entirely taken up with a mass of repulsive domestic business. 
1. Thank you for your good offices with Duncker.493 You're 
mistaken, by the by, if you think that I expected glowing tributes 
from the German press, or gave a rap for them. I expected to be 
attacked or criticised but not to be utterly ignored, which, 
moreover, is bound to have a serious effect on sales. Considering 
how vehemently these people have, at various times, railed against 
my communism, it was to be expected that they would now 
unleash their wisdom against the theoretical argument in support 
of the same. For after all, Germany is not without its specialised 
journals on economics. 
In America the first instalment3 was discussed at length in the 
entire German press from New York to New Orleans. I only fear 
that it is too theoretical in tone for the working-class public there.

298. Marx to Lassalle. 6 November 1859 519 
You'll have been surprised by the information in the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung concerning Vogt's law-suit 470 and by the strange 
company in which I find myself in that journal/ 
Here, in  brief,  is the story: 
Besides the Hermann, there used to be a so-called working-men's 
paper here, Die Neue Zeit, whose last editor was Edgar Bauer. One 
of his colleagues on that paper was Biskamp, who was a 
schoolmaster out in the country. The paper was opposed on what 
is called principle to the Hermann. For Edgar Bauer thought it was 
time he played at being a communist. I, needless to say, had 
nothing to do with this. Bauer wrote and told Biskamp that, in 
order to rid himself of a rival, Kinkel had transferred his sheet to 
the printer of the Neue Zeit h which last, depending as it did on 
that printer's credit, was completely in his power. On receipt of 
this letter, Biskamp rushed up to London to discover, not only 
that Kinkel had destroyed the Neue Zeit by swapping printers, but 
also that Edgar Bauer, the editor of the so-called 'working-men's 
paper', had joined the editorial staff of the Hermann and gone 
over to Kinkel. 
A brief note re Biskamp: He was at one time a co-publisher of 
the Hornisse. He edited the Bremer Tages-Chronik in company with 
Dulon and Ruge. In Switzerland he joined the Communist 
League. 494 His relationship with Ruge meant that we never saw 
each other while he was in London. I took no notice of him, but 
he occasionally took notice in a polemical way of me. This man is a 
strange mixture of noble instincts, innate (and also physical) 
weakness, asceticism and idleness, Kantian moral consciousness 
and tactless whimsicality. His nervous irritability makes him liable 
to surrender any position 'on principle', to precipitate himself 
suddenly into the most hopeless situation, to endure it passively 
and stoically for a while, and then suddenly perpetrate stupidities 
bordering on the iniquitous. The man as I paint him here is not, 
of course, the man I used to know. I am painting a portrait which 
experience has gradually pieced together for me. 
But to return to my story. Biskamp at once gave up his 
schoolmaster's post to take up 'the struggle of labour against 
capital' (i.e. Kinkel), started Das Volk without any means what­
soever except subsidies from a workers' society, etc. So long as the 
thing lasted he was, of course, on the verge of starvation. He had 
secured work as correspondent to a couple of papers in Germany, 
but lost this as soon as his new function became known. A few

private lessons barely enabled him to eke out the life of a 
Bohémien. 
Before continuing I should point out that I have had no 
connection whatever with any of the public workers' associations 
(including the so-called communist one50) since 1851. The only 
workers with whom I foregather are 20-30 picked men to whom I 
give private lectures on political economy.483  Liebknecht, however, 
is chairman of the workers' society which helped Biskamp to start 
Das Volk. 
A few days after the birth of this paper Biskamp and 
Liebknecht came to see me and invited me to collaborate. At the 
time I declined outright, partly for want of time and partly 
because I was about to leave London for a longish spell. 444 All I 
promised was to obtain a few financial contributions from friends 
in England, which in fact I did. On that same day I related to both 
of them what Blind had told me with great moral indignation the 
day before about Vogt, and also named my source. Biskamp used 
this for an article, 3 as I later saw. During my absence he reprinted 
in Das Volk Blind's anonymous pamphlet, b which was printed by 
the same press as Das Volk At the same time Liebknecht sent a 
copy of the pamphlet to the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung 470 for 
which he supplies the English article. (As to this last circumstance, 
I should point out that the refugees here contribute to all papers 
indiscriminately. I believe myself to be the only exception to this, 
as I do not contribute to any German paper. Be it noted, by the 
by, that Palmerston, through the channel of the Prussian embassy, 
which in turn used Williams—the English bookseller—for its 
organ, has tried to get Liebknecht removed from the A. A. Z. on 
account of his  ANTI-GOVERNMENTAL  tendencies.) 
After my return to London, Das Volk received from myself and 
Engels various contributions wholly unrelated to the affaire Vogt. 
Apart from a few attacks on Schleinitz's diplomatic circulars/ all I 
supplied was a humorous comment or two on Kinkel's aesthetic 
dissertations in the Hermann, viewed from a grammatical stand­
point.* 1 Life here in London is too tough for one not to indulge 
in distractions of this kind every 8 years or so.

The paper came to a sudden end, mainly for lack of money. 
Biskamp, besides being wholly without means of subsistence, 
contracted a painful disease and had to go into the German 
hospital. When he was discharged he must literally have starved to 
death if I hadn't taken care of him. During this period he wrote to 
several German papers in the hope of becoming their correspon­
dent, but to no effect. Then he got a letter from the editorial 
board of the A. A. Z., whereupon he wrote them that shockingly 
discreditable epistle—behind the backs of his friends, of course.1* 
Naturally he believed he was writing a private letter. The idiot is 
now overcome with contrition and for a couple of days has neither 
eaten nor slept. I don't know what will become of him. If I have 
told you all this at some length, it is not in order to justify the 
man's behaviour, but to explain it. If he were so venal a fellow as 
most of the 'democrats' here, he wouldn't have precipitated 
himself into a situation which he hadn't the strength to endure. 
As to my statement in the A. A. Z.,b the circumstances are as 
follows: 
As you know, Blind published his denunciation of Vogt. At the 
same time an anonymous article by him c appeared in the London 
Free Press (Urquhart's PAPER), containing much the same informa­
tion—I enclose the article with this letter—but omitting Vogt's 
name and sundry other particulars.440  Now when Vogt brought his 
action against the A. A. Z., and the latter appealed to Liebknecht, 
he, being responsible to the A. A. Z., naturally appealed to me 
and I to Blind. The latter refused to answer for his statements. It 
was all due to a misunderstanding, he said. The whole thing had 
nothing to do with him. He even went so far as to give his word of 
honour that he had had nothing to do with the anonymous 
pamphlet. Repeated requests were of no avail. This conduct was 
all the more infamous in that the worthy fellow knew that Vogt 
was citing me—privately in London and publicly in Switzerland— 
as the source of the denunciation so as to represent the whole 
thing as deriving from the malicious ill-will borne by the 
communist towards the 'eminent democrat' and 'ex-imperial 
regent' 410 I therefore began by turning to Collet, who made no 
bones about stating that Blind had written the article in The Free 
Press. Next, I obtained a statement from the type-setterd who had 
set the type for the pamphlet.487 Blind's duplicity called for

castigation. I had absolutely no intention of pulling this 'republi­
can's'  chestnuts out of the fire for him. Indeed, it is only by 
forcing him and Vogt to attack one another that the truth will 
come out. Finally, like any paper which accepts a denunciation of 
this kind, the A. A. Z. deserves to be supplied with 
any information that can possibly help to throw light on the 
facts. 
I shall now have the whole of Germany's vulgar democracy 
about my ears, and Biskamp's folly will make this all the easier for 
them. Needless to say, it would never occur to me to skirmish in 
insignificant journals with all these insignificant scoundrels.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 7 November 1859 
Dear Engels, 
I shall send you the Grimm. a 
I have not written anything yet about Morocco,490 or about the 
Caucasus,495 or any military stuff on Asia. I have no diplomatic 
particulars about Morocco, so you will have to pick up your pen 
again. My circumstances are such as to preclude my doing 
sufficient work on the 2nd instalment, which I regard as of crucial 
importance.473 It does, in fact, contain the pith of all the bourgeois 
stuff. 
Biskamp's letterb  is infinitely discreditable; in view of his 
situation one can explain but not excuse it. The whole of vulgar 
democracy is seeking to hush up the Blind affair in the German 
press while assailing me. E.g. Mr Meyen, present editor of the 
Freischütz." I have now sent a sharply-worded statement to the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung and the Reform in Hamburg.* 1 I shall 
bring Vogt and Blind face to face even if it has to be done at gun 
point. 
In a couple of lines in the Tribune the wretched Pulszky 
dismisses my lettere as emanating from the camp of the 'CRACKED' 
Urquhart.£ The fellows dare not open their traps. For they don't 
know what kind of evidence we have at our disposal. For Kossuth, 
or so Szemere wrote and told me, secretly decamped after the

Dear Lassalle, 
I am answering your by return. 
It isn't a question of your finding the money, but of a bill 
transaction. Would you allow me to draw on you at 3 months? // 
so you would be provided with security (guaranteed not only by 
myself,  but also by Engels) before the bill fell due. It's a question, 
therefore, of an accommodation bill or, to put it more crudely, 
kite-flying. It still remains very doubtful, of course, whether I could 
manage to negotiate a bill of this kind over here. However there 
might be some  CHANCE  of it. Engels would have procured what was 
necessary had not all his liquid assets been tied up as a result of an 
action for causing bodily harm to an Englishman. 3 The affair is 
costing more than £100 and accommodation bills drawn in 
London on Manchester are only possible between businessmen. 
I think it is now too late to insert the anti-Meyen statement.b 
Assuming the Reform and the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung accept 
it, it would arrive too late in Berlin/ Assuming they don't accept it, 
it will in any case be too late for any consideration of the great 
Meyen's article,* 1 which will by then be outdated.

As regards Vogt, it behoves our party—as opposed to vulgar 
democracy—to force him to pick up the gauntlet thrown down by 
Blind. Both gentlemen seem to be equally anxious to keep their 
distance. It was very clever of Vogt to make me out to be the 
source of the denunciation, but also to select as his target the 
A. Z. in Augsburg rather than the Volk in London. As regards 
myself,  he can attribute the thing to rancour, if only because of 
the erstwhile opposition to him on the part of the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung. (You are doubtless aware that, when Lupus came to the 
National Assembly in Frankfurt, he opposed Uhland's vote of 
thanks to John, the imperial regent. Vogt seized this opportunity 
to vent his spleen and made an abusive speech attacking the 
N. Rh. Z. en general and Lupus in particular. 97 Lupus thereupon 
called him out. But Vogt thought his skin too valuable to the 
Fatherland to risk it in this way. Lupus thereupon threatened to 
box his ears publicly in the street. Thereafter Vogt never made an 
appearance unless flanked by his sister on one side and a woman 
acquaintance of his sister's on the other. And Lupus was too 
courteous, etc.) But again, Mr Vogt knew that Germany's vulgar 
democrats regard me as their  bête noire. Furthermore, had he sued 
Das Volk instead of the A. Z., Blind, etc., would have been legally 
compelled to give evidence on oath and the matter would have 
been bound to come to light. Finally, it was one thing to break a 
lance with a revolutionary paper direct, and quite another to do so 
with the reactionary A. Z. The way in which the 'noble' Vogt 
(Vogt the 'well-rounded', as his barrister described him, 498 is rather 
more  TO THE  POINT) attacked me in the Biel Handels-Courier* rejoiced 
my heart. I am, it seems, in communication with 'the police', live off 
the workers, and such-like inanities. 
As to Kossuth, all the particulars about his transaction with 
Bonaparte were provided by Szemere (formerly Hungarian Prime 
Minister, presently in Paris).479 I sent him my anti-Kossuth articleb 
in the Tribune and shall let you have it as soon as he returns me 
the cutting from Paris. The nicest part of it is that Kossuth's agent, 
Pulszky, is the Tribune's London correspondent. 
The Schiller festival here was a Kinkel festival. 486 Freiligrath 
himself,  who took part in it despite my warning, now realises that 
Gottfried used him simply as a tool. He told me that Kinkel's 
melodramatic speech was a veritable farce which literally had to be

went on behind the scenes between Kinkel and Freiligrath before 
the public performance actually took place.3 In the days of the 
N. Rh. Z. Gottfried invariably figured in the press with a 
travelling-bag for attribute. Later on, it was a musket, then a lyre, 
then a  distaff.  Now our parson never does so without a black, red 
and gold flag.499 The so-called 'working men' whom he has 
gathered round him belong to a guild; article 1 of the rules of 
their society runs: 'In accordance with the rules, all politics are to 
be excluded from the society's debates.' Before 1848 these same 
fellows enjoyed Bunsen's patronage.

Dear Lassalle, 
Could you possibly get the Volks-Zeitung to publish the following 
reply c to Blind's declaration in No. 313 of the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung} If so, please send me 2 COPIES of it. En passant, I 
would draw your attention to the hymn of self-adulation struck up 
by Gottfried Kinkel in the latest Hermann 6 to the accompaniment 
of general rejoicing on the part of the Germans in London. 
In haste.

Dear Engels, 
I hope that a Morocco will arrive from you on Friday.3 Apart 
from everything else, this is the time of the presidential elections, 
and in any case I fear that restrictions will again be put on the 
quantity of articles to be delivered. This fate will befall me all the 
sooner if, given the present shortage of material, I don't write 
about THEMES like this that interest the fellows. 
You must also write something for me,  PRIVATELY,  OF COURSE,  not for 
the Tribune, about the Schiller tomfoolery in Manchester. In my 
next I shall tell you about the Kinkel festival down here. Just now 
Freiligrath is deeply resentful of Gottfried. Meanwhile you should 
read the latest number of the Hermann^ and see with your own 
eyes how 'Parson Charming' drools over  himself. 
The Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung has not, it seems, accepted my 
declaration because it was apparently rendered superfluous by the 
one sent to them by Blind. c I have now sent them an answer to 
this slyboots from Baden with a positive demand—for I refer at 
the same time to the letters they wrote med—that they print my 
answer/

ENGELS TO EMIL ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
Manchester, 16 November 1859 
Dear Emil, 
Our procedure and method of adjustment are simply as follows: 
The rollers are removed and the yarn laid over them, after which 
they are replaced; the upper roller is then moved upwards by 
means of screws (one at either end of the machine) until there is 
sufficient tension on the yarn. 
1. The rollers are made of iron with rectangular pegs at the 
ends which fit into rectangular apertures (in the axle). This, 
however, applies only to the lower roller, which is rotated by the 
machine; the upper one rests in a simple socket and runs 
automatically with the other. 
2. As already said, the screws are at either end of the upper 
roller and are tightened by the machine, not by hand. 
3. The brushing cylinder has fixed mountings for its axle so as 
to ensure that it is in the right position immediately the yarn is in 
place and tightened. For all but the very fine counts we now have 
cylinders clothed alternately with brushes and wooden slats which 
rub against the yarn. 
4. Your final question—how the connection is effected between 
the roller one inserts and the part that rotates—is not clear to me; 
however I think it has already been answered under 1. 
It's impossible for me to make you a sketch of the machine, as I 
can't describe the wheels from memory. But you'll have no 
difficulty in making one of your own, since to the best of my 
knowledge all the essential parts correspond exactly to yours, and 
we use the same machine both for coarse and fine counts, altering 
the PULLEYS, if anything, in order to reduce the speed. For normal 
use the average diameter of the PULLEYS for the brushes is 20 inches 
and for the rollers 14 inches, the speed of the shaft being 163.90 
revolutions per minute. For really fine counts we increase the 
diameter of the  PULLEY  for the rollers to 18 inches. The screws are 
driven  by an -OPEN AND CROSS STRAF. 
Our machines are made partly by ourselves, partly by Wren & 
Hopkinson; you wouldn't be able to buy a complete machine or 
individual parts over here unless you approached G. Ermen.

Manchester, 17 November 1859 
Dear Moor, 
As though it wasn't enough to be saddled with a Russian, I have 
a Genevan arriving today, and Ermen shows an increasing 
tendency to foist onto me the onerous side of representing the 
firm. Nevertheless I still had hopes this morning of finding time 
for an article, but it proved utterly impossible. Next Tuesday, 
however, you will get an article on Morocco,3 you may be sure of that. 
This will be followed as soon as possible by more on the RIFLE 
VOLUNTEER MOVEMENT,502 Prussian army reformb and diverse other 
matters. 
The business of the ASSAULT has been settled/ Thirty pounds 
damages and twenty-five costs. It's been paid-^partly by borrow­
ing. The action was brought in London and, quite apart from the 
scandal up here, the publication in the German papers of The 
Times report of the affair would have been a nice juicy titbit for

poetical creations consisting, as you will observe, of 
Prologue by Meissner,

audience to sleep. Fortunately this made everything so late that a 
full performance of the programme would have lasted until 1 
o'clock in the morning. Samelson's stanzas were therefore con­
signed to the lumber room. The 'Armada'3 was excellently recited 
by one Link, then came the play.b  A very nice stage, but bad 
acoustics, excellent grouping, much—almost too much—activity 
constantly going on up stage. All in all, the lads acted quite well 
but were difficult to understand on account of the unduly 
voluminous beards they wore in front of their mouths and also 
because they didn't address the audience properly. The friar was 
good (Dolch, a former corps student, author of a Geschichte des 
Deutschen Studententhums, a fool and a donkey). Siebel's epilogue, 
delivered by Link in a most melodious voice and with much 
decorum, was effective. In short, part 2 saved the day; in the 
second part and in the piece dropped from the first the lads 
predominated (also indirectly attributable to a good deal of 
•UNDERHAND INFLUENCE' on my part, for the introduction to Wallensteins 
Lager was composed from data supplied by me and was actually 
very good); the first was dominated by the wiseacres and 
self-assertive philistines and schoolmasters. 
Now they propose to found a Schiller Institute492 with the 
surplus, the surplus, however, being a deficit of £150!

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 19 November 1859 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Engels, 
Today I'm sending you all sorts of curious things: 1. a letter 3 
from philistine Freiligrath to me; 2. a letter from Orges (of the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung) to Biskamp; 3. an issue (No. 43) of 
the Gartenlaube^ published in Leipzig, and 4. a letter from Imandt 
to me together with a cutting from the Trier Volksblatt 504 Finally, I 
would advise you to buy .today's Hermann as it contains the story, 
devised by Mr Beta, of the Schiller festival here and casts a strange 
light on the conduct of our friend Freiligrath. c 
Before going into these matters and in case I forget, I would 
mention that the Hungarians in New York, Chicago, New Orleans, 
etc., have held meetings at which they resolved to send Kossuth a 
letter suggesting he vindicate himself with reference to my article 
in the New-York Tribune.d Otherwise they would renounce their 
ALLEGIANCE to him. I don't know whether I have told you about the 
latest news I have received from Szemere.e  D'abord, 1 that after the 
peace of Villafranca, Kossuth decamped from Italy without a word 
to his officers, amongst whom Klapka. Kossuth was afraid 
Bonaparte would hand him over to Francis Joseph. 496 Originally, 
so Szemere now writes, this same worthy had not been included in 
the Bonaparte business. Klapka, Kiss and Teleki had, off their 
own bat, agreed with Plon-Plon to instigate a revolution in 
Hungary. Kossuth got wind of it and, from London, threatened to 
denounce them in the English press should they not include him in 
the compact. SUCH ARE THOSE WORTHIES. 
In some ways I envy you for being able to live in Manchester, 
cut off as you are from the war between mice and frogs.505 Down 
here I have to wade through all this ordure and do so in 
circumstances which already consume too much of the time I

should be devoting to my theoretical studies. Conversely, I'm glad 
that you only have to put up with all the ordure at second hand. 
Last Thursday I received the enclosed letter from Freiligrath. 
What follows will help you understand the full extent of his 
depravity and pettiness. Throughout the time when that fellow 
(Blind) was playing his perfidious role vis-à-vis ourselves, he was 
on the most intimate terms with Freiligrath. He acted as his homme 
d'affaires—in the matter of the great Kinkel-Freiligrath controver­
sy—on the organising committee for the Schiller festival. At that 
festival the Blind and Freiligrath families sat cheek by jowl 
throughout the performance. Well, on the following morning 3 The 
Morning Advertiser carried a report in which Freiligrath's poem 
was described as 'ABOVE MEDIOCRITY'b. The same critical sense 
(whereof,  indeed, not much is needed to strip student Blind of his 
mask of anonymity) which told me that Blind, and Blind alone, 
had written the anti-Vogt paragraph in The Free Press,c  also told 
me that he was the author of this article. The only thing which 
surprised me was that the obsequious sycophant had had the 
courage to speak about Freiligrath IN THIS COOL MANNER. I sent the 
latter thé cutting. Whereupon I received from him the enclosed 
letter which, if one reads between the lines, more or less voices the 
suspicion that J was responsible for introducing a forgery into 
student Blind's  EXERCISE—namely,  the quip about Freiligrath. On 
Saturday I went to see Freiligrath. I didn't yet know about the 
statement he had made in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung (to wit, 
that he was not one of Vogt's accusers, nor had he ever written a line 
for the 'Volk'). d He was careful, too, not to breathe a word to me 
about it. I told him de prime  abord e that I thought it by no means a 
crime on Blind's part to consider Freiligrath's poem as 'ABOVE 
MEDIOCRITY', for this was an aesthetic judgment; but that it did 
seem to me altogether too much when he allowed Blind to 
bamboozle him into thinking I had amended Blind's task for 
him—through some mysterious third party—and interpolated the 
quip about himself (Freiligrath). Greatly embarrassed, the philis-
tine now admitted,  d'abord,*  that he had shown Blind my letter, 
and proceeded to show me the two letters from Blind. In the first, 
student Blind describes a person frequently seen near me at the 
Urquhartite meeting of 9 May 420 and who had skulked round him 
a 11 November 1859 - b 'Crystal Palace.—The Schiller Commemoration', The 
Morning Advertiser, No. 21344, 11 November 1859. -  <= [K. Blind,] The Grand Duke

at the Crystal Palace (10 November).503  In the second letter 
(Freiligrath was condescending enough to write to Blind saying he 
couldn't believe J had interpolated the insulting bit) Blind declares 
that that wasn't really what he'd meant to say. I next told the 
philistine that the only two Germans or, for that matter, persons, 
who had accosted me more than once on the platform on 9 May 
had been Blind and Faucher and NOBODY ELSE. Well now, Blind 
knows Faucher, whom he asked to be introduced to on the Schiller 
committee and whom he thanked on Freiligrath's behalf for 
backing Freiligrath's 'cantata' against the 'speech'. 3 Again, the 
slyboots from Baden failed to mention Faucher's name. (I 
immediately informed the latter of the fact.) For Faucher knows 
EDITOR Grant of The Morning Advertiser, and might help to get 
Blind kicked out of the  LICENSED  VICTUALLER PAPER were he to demand 
that Blind make a personal statement as to whether he (Faucher) 
had got him (Grant) to interpolate something in Blind's article, 
which is why student Blind is capable of remembering what 
Faucher's FEATURES were like on 9 May. He recalls that they were 
the same FEATURES that skulked round him at the Crystal Palace on 10 
November. But he forgets that this individual he knows so well is 
that selfsame Faucher. 
This whole business is so rotten—tortuous—and so typical of 
philistines Freiligrath and Blind that I had to go into this nonsense 
at some length. It's altogether typical of philistine Freiligrath that 
he should not deem himself accountable to me for his appearance 
in public with Kinkel and Co., for his statement in the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung, for his coquetry with the Hermann, for his 
intercourse with Blind at a time when he knew about that 
scoundrel's 'word of honour', b etc.—but believes that everything 
should revolve round somebody's having had the audacity to find 
his poem (I enclose it)  ABOVE  MEDIOCRITY' instead of crying it up  AS THE 
VERY INCARNATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME. 
I told him I didn't give a fig for that affair, compared with 
which there were far more important things at stake between 
myself and Blind, etc. 
As for the 'machinations' against him on the part of Kinkel, etc., 
he had only himself to blame. Why demean himself with the 
fellows? 
Finally I wanted to know what was contained in No. 43 of the 
Gartenlaube.'' It then transpired that Mr Freiligrath was on very 
a by Kinkel (see this volume, pp. 512-13) - b See this volume, pp. 502-04. - c It 
contained Beta's article 'Ferdinand Freiligrath'.

close terms with Mr Beta, had entertained him in his own house 
and had 'suffered' Beta to write a fulsome biography of himself 
and an apotheosis of his family, and was irritated only at Beta's 
having concluded (at Kinkel's instigation, of course) with the 
suggestion that Freiligrath's poetry, like his character, was being 
ruined—by me. It was I who was to blame for the fact that Mr 
Freiligrath, never particularly' prolific in the matter of original 
work, had for years pursued the business of banking rather than 
the business of poetry. Mr Freiligrath showed no feeling of shame 
in my presence for having demeaned himself by consorting with 
that scoundrel Beta, one-time sub-editor of Louis Drucker's How 
do you do? Nor for the gross flattery ladled out by that abject 
creature. What shocked him was to be publicly portrayed as 
'influenced' by me. He wasn't sure whether he oughtn't to make 
some statement on the subject, being deterred from doing so only 
by his fear of a counter-statement on my part. The fellow thinks it 
'in the nature of things' that, if he lets out a fart, it should cause a 
great flurry; that on the one hand he should serve Mammon and, 
on the other, be 'priest to the Muse'; that his want of character in 
practice should be hailed as 'political virtue' in theory. The man is 
sensitive to the tiniest pin-prick. His petty histrionic bickerings 
behind the scenes with Gottfried" he treats as weighty intrigues. 
On the other hand he considers it quite in order that my family 
should forego, not just recognition but even notice, of a closely 
reasoned work such as the instalment on money, b and that, as a 
result of my uncompromising political attitude, they should have 
to endure much misère and, in fact, lead a joyless existence. The 
man thinks that my wife should, moreover, gratefully bear with 
the slights publicly inflicted on myself in the knowledge that Mrs 
Freiligrath is eulogised and extolled and that even his Käthchen, c a 
SILLY GOOSE who doesn't understand a word of German, is 
commended to your German philistines. The man has not a 
vestige of fellow-feeling. Otherwise he would see how my wife is 
suffering, and how much he and his spouse contribute thereto. 
How false and ambiguous his behaviour is, both from the personal 
and the party point of view. 
Nevertheless, I cannot and dare not risk any kind of éclat d with the 
fellow. He sees to my bills on the Tribune, something I'm bound to 
regard as a favour (although the standing thus gained with 
Bischoffsheim is to his advantage, not mine). Otherwise I should

find myself in the same old quandary about how to get my money 
from the Tribune. On the other hand, nothing would please 
Kinkel and Co.—the whole of vulgar democracy (including Mrs 
Freiligrath)—more than that this row should take place. If only 
for that reason it shouldn't be allowed to happen just now. 
However, it will be hard for me to take all these slights lying 
down.

Another thing you should note in the latest rotten Hermann is 
the way Mr Blind commends himself as a prophet.3 
The UPSHOT of all the Hermann's revelations from Berlin re 
Stieber is that Duncker, the old policeman, is again trying to take 
the place of Stieber, his rival and enemy (since 1848).b Moreover, in 
the last issue but one of the Hermann, the reinstatement of Police 
Superintendent Duncker was declared by the Berlin correspon­
dent to be the true aim of modern world history.0

1. THANKS for your last letter but one. I shall, however, probably 
succeed in arranging a bill on myself here in London, at an 
exorbitant rate of interest. 
2. You had best abandon your anti- Vogt statement now that 
the Reform has already printed a statement of mine. 3 My chief 
concern now is to compel Mr Vogt to pursue the matter in 
London. b 
3. I have told Freiligrath that you have praised his poem on 
Schiller and criticised his conduct towards you.507  He will now 
write to you. Read No. 43 of the Gartenlaube wherein Kinkel's 
sycophant, Mr Beta (sometime editor of the How do you do? 
published here by Louis Drucker, and presently  faiseur-en-chef c of 
the Hermann, whose EDITORS are all recruited from the literary 
Lumpenproletariat), makes the discovery that Freiligrath 'seldom 
sang any more' after he had been 'inspired' by me. d During recent 
years Freiligrath has been whoring too much after the idols of 
Babylon, so great is his thirst for popularity. His wife may not be 
an altogether beneficent influence IN THIS RESPECT. I will dilate no 
further on this theme, except to say that I show more considera­
tion for old personal and party friends than seems right to many 
very clever people in our party. 
4. Ad vocem' Bonaparte. So far as I can see, the Italian war370 
has temporarily strengthened Bonaparte's position in France; 
betrayed the Italian revolution into the hands of the Piedmontese 
doctrinaires and their henchmen; made Prussia exceptionally 
popular with the liberal vulgus( by virtue of her Haugwitzian 
policy; increased Russia's influence in Germany; and, finally, 
propagated demoralisation of an unprecedented kind—a most 
repulsive combination of Bonapartism and drivel about 
nationalities. I for my part fail to see any reason why members of 
our party had to give dialectical support to these nauseous, 
counter-revolutionary illusions of philistine-liberal provenance. It 
is my belief that, from the moment when Disraeli publicly 
admitted the existence of an alliance between Bonaparte and 
Russia,415 and more especially from the moment when Russia sent 
out her shameless circular note to the German courts,* the 
battle-cry should have been raised against the .Russo-French

alliance. Opposition to Russia would instandy have disposed of the 
delusion that there was anything anti-liberal about a turning 
against France. 
Schleinitz's despatches,3  which I have studied in detail, together 
with the statements made by the ministers over here, some direct 
to Parliament, some in the press, confirm my view that Prussia had 
no intention of intervening so long as the German frontier was not 
violated. Bonaparte, as the protégé of Russia and England, had at 
the time been given permission to conduct a 'localised' war in 
order to keep him in France. Prussia would not have dared lift a 
finger and, had she done so, there would have been war between 
Germany and Russia, than which nothing could be more desirable. 
But IN FACT  there was no question of it, because Prussia would never 
have had the courage to take such a step. Rather it was a question, 
partly of exposing the Prussian government in all its miserable 
weakness, partly and above all of unmasking Bonapartist DELUSIONS. 
Nor would the game have been too difficult, since all the 
representatives of the revolutionary party from Mazzini to Louis 
Blanc, Ledru-Rollin and even Proudhon would have joined in. 
This would have meant that the polemic against Bonaparte's 
imposture could not have acquired the appearance of hostility to 
Italy or France. 
I am not, of course, going into the matter thoroughly here, but 
merely jotting down a few points. However, I shall, with your 
permission, make one further observation. There is a possibility 
that things will come to a head again soon. In that case one of two 
things must prevail in our party: either no one speaks for the 
party without prior consultation with the others, or everyone has 
the right to put forward his views without any regard for the 
others. Now this last is certainly not to be recommended, since a 
public polemic would in no way benefit so small a party (which, I 
hope, makes up in vigour for what it lacks in numbers). I can only 
say that, during my travels through England and Scotland (this 
summer)444—for our old party friends are scattered about the 
country—I did not find anybody here who would not have wished 
you had modified your pamphlet6 in many respects. I see a quite 
simple explanation for this, namely that foreign policy, in 
a to the Prussian embassies in Britain, Russia and Germany (Berlin, June-July 1859); 
reports on the despatches appeared in the Neue Preußische Zeitung, No. 170, 24 July 
1859 ('Zu der "Vermittlung"'), No. 171, 26 July ('Preußische Depeschen') and 
No. 174, 29 July 1859 ('Deutschland'). See also p. 520 - b F. Lassalle, Der italienische

MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 23 November 1859 
Dear Freiligrath, 
I have just received a copy of your letter to Liebknecht" in 
which the following passage occurs: 
'I possess only one letter from Vogt, dated 1 April 1859. This letter, as Marx 
conceded only last Saturday, does not contain a single syllable that might be used to 
substantiate a charge against Vogt.' 
Since accuracy is desirable in matters of this kind, I must 
register a formal protest in regard to this passage. 
Firstly, I conceded nothing. To concede  (conce'dere)  presupposes a 
debate in which one of the assertions originally put forward is 
withdrawn and the opposing view accepted. Nothing of the kind 
happened between us. The initiative was mine. I told you 
something; I conceded nothing. The facts were as follows: 
I recalled that you yourself had asked Mr Blind whether he was 
the author of the anonymous pamphlet,b since both the tone and 
the content of his verbal account tallied entirely with the 
pamphlet.461 I stressed that, before encountering Mr Blind at 
Urquhart's meeting of 9 May,420  I knew nothing of Vogt's 
participation in the Italian imbroglio, save only for his letter to 
you. I reminded you that, on the evening you showed me that 
letter, it never remotely occurred to me to infer therefrom that 
Vogt had been bribed, or anything of the kind. All I found in the 
letter was the same old, all too familiar, superficially liberal 
a Freiligrath's letter to Liebknecht of 21 November 1859. - b Zur Warnung 

=====第574页=====
540 308. Marx to Freiligrath. 23 November 1859 
pot-house politics of his. If I laid any emphasis on all this, 
it was— à tout seigneur tout honneur* —so as not to detract in 
any way from Mr Blind's merit in uncovering Vogt's high 
treason. 
Secondly, however, it never occurred to me to say that 'Vogt's 
letter did not contain a single syllable that might be used to 
substantiate a charge against Vogt'. All I said was that, having read 
the letter, it would not occur to me to draw such a conclusion. But 
the immediate subjective impression made upon me by the letter is 
very far removed from an  objective  judgment on the content of the 
letter, or even on conjectures which might be made about it. I 
never had either the occasion or the opportunity to subject the 
letter to the critical examination necessary for such an objective 
judgment. That Mr Blind put a different construction on, for 
instance, the letters Vogt addressed to you, him, etc., is and was 
known to you. E.g. in his article in The Free Press (27 May) b these 
letters are expressly mentioned as corpora delicti,0  even though no 
names are given. This is again the case in his statement in the 
Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung." 1 
From Mr Vogt I now come to Mr Beta, whose No. 43 I bought 
after getting your letter." Having perused the opus, I decided to do 
exactly what I have been doing for the past 10 years, namely 
ignore such  stuff.  But I have today heard from two very close 
friends (not in London) urging me to make a statement in the 
interests of the party. I shall first deliberate the pros and cons 
for twice 24 hours. If, after mature deliberation, I should 
decide to speak, my statement would contain essentially the 
following: 
1. If an attempt were made wrongly to attribute to me any 
influence over you, this could at most apply to the brief life-span 
of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, at which time you were writing 
what was truly splendid and indisputably your most popular 
poetry. 
2. A biographical sketch in a few sentences of Mr Betziege* alias 
Hans Beta, starting from the time when he wrote for a 
blackmailing theatrical rag in Berlin, going on through his 
editorship of the How do you do? under Louis Drucker, vintner 
and clown (including my visit to the How do you dds lair 509) and his 
a honour to whom honour is due - b [K. Blind,] 'The Grand Duke Constantine to Be

subsequent activities in Leipzig, when he simultaneously libelled 
me in the Gartenlaube, i.e. reproduced the tripe from the How do 
you do? and appropriated my anti-Palmerston pamphlets," and 
ending up with his present occupation of factotum to Gottfried 
Kinkel. It might, perhaps, do some good if the German public 
were to be shown what a scoundrelly bunch of lumpenproletarians 
it is that is croaking loudest in the foul swamp of current German 
literature. 
3. Two letters from Heine to myself which will enable the public 
to decide between the authority of Heine and the authority of 
Beta. 
4. Finally, a couple of letters written to me by Johann Kinkel b 
and Johanna Kinkel at the time of the N. Rh. Z. I would use these 
to unseat the melodramatic parson from the high horse upon 
which this Father Brey c (it is in that sense that your version of 
Goethe should be amended) is charging me in what is for him the 
typical arena of a Gartenlaube. 
I am telling you all this so that, as is fitting between friends, you 
will have been informed in advance should I decide to make a 
statement.510 
As for Liebknecht, Kolb is clearly seeking to justify himself in 
Cotta's eyes by using your letter to sacrifice Liebknecht as a 
scapegoat, for his own, not Liebknecht's quid pro quo. Peccant reges, 
plectuntur Achivi d still holds good. 
To obviate all misunderstanding I have, at the same time as this 
letter to you, sent Liebknecht a copy of the passages in it relating 
to the Vogt affair.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 26 November 1859 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Haverstock Hill 
Dear Engels, 
On Monday I sent you a long letter about the wrangles down 
here.  On Tuesday I sent you the Gartenlaube 3 and Beta's article. 512 
Well, every day I've been waiting to hear from you since, in  AFFAIRS  of 
this kind, it is only your  letters  that revive my wife's DROOPING SPIRITS. One 
can simply laugh off such rubbish if the rest of one's life is tolerable. 
But in my CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WEIGH HEAVILY UPON THE FAMILY. 
Well, today I'm sending you: 
1. A letter from Lassalle to myself. 513 The 'statement' I sent the 
Volks-Zeitung is the same as appeared in No. 325 of the Augsburg 
Allgemeine Zeitung. b (Another, two columns long, about my attitude 
to vulgar democracy, etc., appeared in No. 1.39 of the Hamburg 
Reform. c I took the opportunity of naming you as the author of Po 
and Rhine, a fact obstinately kept dark by that same vulgar 
democracy.) From Lassalle's letter you will see that he, who  IN POINT 
OF FACT was piping the same tune as Vogt, would much rather the 
Berlin public did not know about my opposition to Vogt and his 
propaganda. 
From the same letter you will see that he at last intends to set to 
work on his 'Political Economy'™ but is clever enough to wait 
another 3 months until he is in possession of my second 
instalment.473  The motives for the consistent failure, even on the 
part of one who is 'friendly', to break the conspiration de silence are 
now plain. 
I have taken the opportunity of giving Lassalle a brief outline of 
my views on the Italian question, at the same time telling him 
that, should anyone wish at such a critical moment to speak in the 
name of the party, the following alternatives must hold good. 
Either he consults the others beforehand, or the others (euphemis-

tic for you and me) have the right to put their own view before 
the public, without regard for that anyone. 
2. A letter from Liebknecht to Freiligrath. You will have seen 
from the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung that Freiligrath declared, 
firstly, that he had been made out to be Vogt's accuser 'without his 
knowledge and consent'; secondly, that 'he had never written a 
line for the Volk' (doesn't write at all). a Mr Kolb, who had wrongly 
construed a private letter from Liebknecht to himself and had 
been told off by Cotta after this statement of Freiligrath's, 
naturally sacrificed Liebknecht as a scapegoat. 511 But Freiligrath, 
who is a SUBALTERN of Fazy's, was outraged and wrote an 
exceedingly rude letter to Liebknecht.b I enclose Liebknecht's reply 
to it.c 
Now Freiligrath's letter to Liebknecht contained the following 
passage: 
'I possess only one letter from Vogt, dated 1 April 1859. This letter, as Marx 
only last Saturday  conceded'  (I UNDERLINE),  'does not contain a single syllable that might 
be used to substantiate a charge against Vogt. Why on earth, then, should I be trying 
to prove him guilty of attempted bribery?' 
Now although on the one hand Freiligrath is indispensable to me 
for drawing bills on New York, although on the other I wish for 
political reasons to avoid a breach with him, and, lastly, am fond 
of him personally WITH ALL  HIS FAULTS,  I could not do otherwise—it 
was absolutely essential—than send him a formal protest about the 
above lines. For who is to guarantee that he will not write the 
same thing to Vogt and that the latter will not have it published? 
The matter he misrepresents was as follows: 
During my meeting with him, at which the topic was Blind, not 
Vogt,d I told him (there was no question of a  debate,  and still less of 
his calling me to account, as might be inferred from the words 
'Marx conceded') that he himself had considered Blind to be the 
author of the pamphlet,e the latter having told him what he had 
told me; also that, before my meeting with Blind on 9th May,420 I 
had known nothing at all about Vogt's activities, save his letter to 
Freiligrath from which—as he, Freiligrath, would recall—I did not 
infer bribery, but rather found therein the same old, all too 
familiar, superficially liberal pot-house politics of his. This is, after 
all, not at all the same thing as 'conceding that the letter did not

1859.  - b on 21 November 1859 - c  Liebknecht replied on 23 November. - d See this

contain a single line that might be used to substantiate a charge'. I 
pointed this out to him, at the same time expressing my 
astonishment at his failure to call Blind to account for having, in 
The Free Press,3 treated similar letters (including Freiligrath's) as 
corpora delictib So far I have had no answer from him, although he 
usually replies at once. It is possible—and this would be 
disastrous—that he has taken this opportunity to sever old party 
ties which, or so it would seem, have long become irksome to him. 
HOWEVER THAT  MAY  BE, I was bound to protest against his account of 
the affair. 
Enough of this rubbish.

provide evidence next week in a TORY WEEKLY (the WEEKLY MAIL, I 
THINK) to the effect that Garibaldi was receiving money from

interval, repeatedly failed to get hold of him. Lupus is of the same 
opinion as  myself,  namely that Freiligrath's behaviour hardly 
admits of further party relations with him, but that on purely 
party grounds, and aside from your personal position, you are 
absolutely justified in avoiding any breach for the present s'il y a 
moyen 3—it would be a triumph for Kinkel and Co. which they 
would trumpet abroad and exploit for all they were worth. But it's 
something we shan't forgive the weak-minded ass. If his relation­
ship with Fazy really compelled him to make a statement at all, 
Freiligrath ought to have consulted you, which would at any rate 
have resulted in something other than the inane affair which he 
caused to be published in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung? He 
would seem to be dead keen on an amnesty, to judge by his 
strenuous denials of all participation in the Volk. But his getting 
on to personal terms with Mr Bettziech, receiving him in his own 
house, is something which Lupus, who went with Freiligrath to see 
Bettziech at the time of the How do you do? affair, 509 will never 
forgive him. And it really is a dirty trick. As things are now, 
however, it seems questionable whether we can go on much longer 
without an open breach with Freiligrath; he is increasingly subject 
to the literary man's itch, nor will madame 0 fail to point out morning, 
noon and night that Mr Beta, Kinkel and company do at least 
praise him publicly, whereas all he gets from us even privately is a 
MODICUM of recognition, and we can never be relied on to make him 
'known by reason of his fame'. d However, Freiligrath is all too well 
aware that, while Kinkel and Co. may be of use to him in 
peacetime, he would be nothing without us at the moment of 
batde, and that he could never ally himself with our enemies 
without running all manner of unpleasant risks. He will, I think, 
take care not to go too far and will finally pin his hopes on our 
forbearance. 
Your 'Declaration' in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung" will put 
Blind into a very nasty position. How, without discrediting  himself, 
he will lie his way out of the pass his lies have brought him to, I 
fail to see. 
These shabby goings-on must indeed be a sore trial to your wife.

MARX  TO  FERDINAND FREILIGRATH514 
IN LONDON 
[London, about  30  November  1859] 
Dear Freiligrath, 
I am  neither Liebknecht's letter-writer,  nor his  ATTORNEY.  I shall, 
however, send  him a  copy  of that part  of your letter which relates 
to him. 
I have decided against  the  statement  I had  briefly envisaged, 
bearing  in mind that  'odi  profanum vulgus  et arceo'." 
While  the  statement  was  certainly against Beta,  it was for  that 
very reason bound  to be  also about  you, as you  will have seen from 
the SUMMARY.  If only  for  that reason,  I gave  you  notice  of it,  quite 
apart from  the  intimacy  in which your family  and his  appear  in his 
opu$culum.h 
You find  it unpleasant  to have your name mixed  up in the  Vogt 
affair.  I don't give  a damn  for  Vogt  and his  infamous lies  in the 
Biel Handels-Courier, c but I  will  not  have  my  name used  as a  mask 
by democratic tricksters.  As you  know,  if someone  is forced  to call 
upon witnesses,  no  other person  can  'object'  to being cited  as a 
witness.  In  accordance with ancient English legal USE,  RESTIVE 
WITNESSES  may,  horribile dictu,d actually  be  crushed  to death.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN MANCHESTER 
London, 10 December 1859 
Dear Engels, 
Article received." I trust your health has improved. 
As to the Freiligrath business, more in the course of this letter. I 
presume you saw the Hermann of a week ago today containing 
'Vorletzte Sitzung des Schiller-Comités', b a self-portrait of the 
scoundrelly bunch of lumpenproletariaris which has gathered 
round Gottfried Kinkel. The article was written by the worthy 
Beta. 
What do you make of Mr Lassalle's notifying me  ALL  AT ONCE  of 
his 'Political Economy'.278 Does this not explain why my work0  was, 
firstly, so much delayed and, secondly, so badly advertised? 
Lassalle lives in Duncker's house, or so I am told by Fischel of Berlin 
(was in England for a few days; editor of the Berlin Portfolio 492— 
Urquhartite—of which Nos. 1 and 2 contain excerpts from my 
anti-Palmerston PAMPHLETS on Poland and Unkiar-Skelessi d). In

Berlin, it would seem, he (Lassalle) is noted for his vanity. The 
stick with which he was given a drubbing 3 was Ais own—a 
memento bought in Paris, Robespierre's stick bearing the device, 
liberté, égalité, fraternité! 
I wrote and asked Lassalle whether he might not be able to get 
hold of some money for me (against a bill on myself which I 
would give him). b He replied saying that he himself was living on 
credit until July, and had appropriated Duncker's FLOATING  SURPLUS. 
Then he suggested I draw a bill on him (Lassalle), discount it 
here,  and send him the money before it fell due. But over here 
the name of Lassalle is not, of course, worth Vioo of a FARTHING. I 
have latterly been cited at the COUNTY COURT by sundry fellows— 
quite small ones, such as the MILKMAN, etc., and can, in fact, see no 
way out of the crisis which has grown steadily worse for the past 
half year. Extra expenses, e.g. ABOUT £5 for the rotten Volk 
lawsuit, and Mr Biskamp, whom I have fed for three months (and 
am not yet quit of), have, indeed, contributed their mite to the 
predicament. But all in all that made little odds. What is really 
devilish is not having a Bamberger here in London any more, for 
there are at present considerable possibilities in regard to bill 
transactions. Had fat philistine Freiligrath so wished, he might 
even have procured me a LOAN, for after all the philistine had the 
security to hand. But the fellow imagined (and no doubt actually 
boasted) that he was doing a great deal if, a week before I drew a 
bill on the Tribune, he loaned me £2 for a week. I have, by the by, 
made various other attempts to find a usurer. BUTTILLNOWWITHOUTANY 
RESULT. 
I know that you yourself are in a fix as a result of being taken 
to court recently,0 and hence am telling you about the  STATE  OF 
THINGS only because I feel a need to discuss it with SOMEBODY. I hope 
that our domestic misfortunes won't deter you from coming up here 
for a few  days.  It's absolutely essential for my girls to have a 'human 
being' in the house again for once. The poor children have been 
too early tormented by domestic misery. 
Now ad vocemd Freiligrath. 
Having waited a week, the philistine wrote the following letter: 
'Dear Marx, 
'I have received your letter of the 23 inst.' (November)e 'and Liebknecht's of the 
same date and, in order to simplify matters, am replying to both in this letter to

Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung thinks  fit to put my  name  at Mr  Kolb's disposal  ad 
libitum  and  without previously notifying  me a; but I, if I  protest against that abuse, 
must first give  due  notice!!  The  argument used  by Liebknecht  in support  of this 
pretty doctrine  is so  jejune that  it calls  for no  serious refutation  on my  part. 
I would simply remark that,  in no  circumstances  and for no  personal  or 
party considerations whatsoever, shall  I put up  with arbitrary actions  of this 
nature. 
'That's  all about  and for  Liebknecht! 
'And  now for  your letter. 
'I gladly allow your objection  to the  word "conceded" used  in my  letter  to 
Liebknecht  (of 21  November).  I set no  store  by that word.  Nor did it  conceal  any 
implication  of any  kind,  and I  might just  as well have used "remarked"  or "said". 
So without further contention  I concede your "conceded".  If we  were both  of the 
same opinion from  the  start,  so much  the  better!' 
(The slyboots doesn't tumble to the fact that he is thereby 
conceding wry opinion of Vogt and Blind.) 
'As regards your anti-Beta statement  you  must,  of course,  do exactly  as you 
think  fit. All the  same,  I believe that your first impulse  to ignore  the  thing was  the 
better  one and  more worthy  of you! Now  that you  have  had  more than twice  24 
hours  for  deliberation,  you  will have decided  one way or the  other. Whether this 
way or that  is quite immaterial  to me! 
'That  you  should have wished  to inform  me  beforehand,  "as is  fitting between 
friends",  of your anti-Beta statement  is most deserving  of thanks.  For  that matter 
your statement,  so far as I can see, was to be  directed against Beta,  not  against 
myself,  and  hence scarcely called  for  prior notification  of your intention 
'At all  events  let me not  omit  to mention  en  revanche that  I myself shall 
probably  be publishing another statement  in which  I shall repeat, once  and for all, 
that I object  to the use of my  name  in connection with  the  Vogt affair. 
Your 
F. Freiligrath.' 
UNDER  THE  CIRCUMSTANCES  I could, of course, only reply IN A  VERY 
MODERATE TONE  to this letter, 'malicious' in intent and adorned with so 
many!! I therefore wrote by return: 
'Dear Freiligrath,0 
'I am neither Liebknecht's letter-writer, nor his  ATTORNEY.  I shall, 
however, send him a copy of that part of your letter which relates 
to him. 
'I have decided against the statement I had briefly envisaged, 
bearing in mind that "odi profanum valgus et arceo". d 
'While the statement was certainly against Beta, it was for that 
very reason bound to be also about you, as you will have seen from 
the SUMMARY.  If only for that reason, I gave you notice of it, quite

put me  into  a real rage. Unfortunately  the  chap's such  a cripple 
already that  no  amount  of  beating could make  him  more 
misshapen than  he is.  However, sometime  we shall have  to wreak 
personal vengeance  on the  rascal.  At any  rate, some satisfaction 
can be derived from  the  fact that Kinkel's beautiful soul  is forced 
to seek  its mate  in a  filthy  pig of  this kind. Just think what  it takes 
to produce  one  single Bettziech! Whole generations  of crippled 
moles having,  by the  Darwinian process  of  NATURAL SELECTION, 
evolved  to the  highest degree  the  faculty  to live on dung, with shit 
for their chosen element. Filthy, blatant lies  and  impotent 
malice—such  are the  tools with which that mendacious parson 
Kinkel's  bad  conscience seeks  to keep  on its  legs. LET  US GET  THESE 
FELLOWS ONCE FACE TO FACE AGAIN,  and  you'll  see  what becomes  of the 
gang  of scoundrels. 
Darwin,  by the way,  whom  I'm  reading just  now, is  absolutely 
splendid.3 There  was one  aspect  of teleology that  had yet to be 
demolished,  and  that  has now  been done. Never before  has so 
grandiose  an  attempt been made  to  demonstrate' historical 
evolution  in Nature,  and  certainly never  to such good effect.  One 
does,  of course, have  to put up  with  the  crude English method.

may, perhaps, succeed. In which case there would be a chance of our 
being able to breathe again. 
In Russia the movement is progressing better than anywhere 
else in Europe. On the one hand the constitutionalism of the 
aristocracy versus the Tsar, on the other of the peasants versus the 
aristocracy. Moreover, having at long last realised that the Poles 
have not the least inclination to be dissolved in Slav-Russian 
nationality, Alexander blustered frightfully. Thus the extraordi­
nary successes of Russian diplomacy during the past 15 years, 
notably since 1849, are more than counter-balanced. Come the 
next revolution and Russia will oblige by joining in. 
You have, I imagine, read Bonaparte's uneasy document 
addressed to the préfets in which he demands that exact returns be 
made of, inter alia, all respectable Orleanists, 124 Legitimists,303 
republicans and socialists, but more especially of 'reliable' 
Bonapartists? 
From the enclosed note you will see that that louse, Juch— 
PROPRIETOR of the Hermann—feels entitled to approach me about 
the Stieber affair.517  The rotten swine had deleted from Eichhoff's 
denunciation of Stieber in the Hermann* everything relating to our 
trial, ' the 'small, insignificant party' being alluded to only en 
passant I shall give the low scoundrel a proper dressing-down 
while, of course, doing everything in my power to damage that 
rascal Stieber.  Eichhoff,  by the by, was simply a tool where all 
these Stieber revelations were concerned. The business originated 
with ex-policeman Duncker in Berlin, whose removal in 1848 was 
largely brought about by Stieber's yapping from the democratic 
camp.  From then on Duncker got his private police to watch 
Stieber's every step until he finally thought the moment had come 
for him to be kicked out. Furthermore, that ass Eichhoff was 
stupid enough to show his ass's ears in his last article from Berlin 
in the Hermann, in which HE WOUND UP HIS DENUNCIATIONS AGAINST 
STIEBER—WITH WHAT? WITH THE REQUEST OF THE RESTITUTIO IN INTEGRUM OF 
VIRTUOUS Police Superintendent Duncker. b 
Nothing but fools and rapscallions, all these chaps, against 
whom Freiligrath bears no grudge, even if they do 'take liberties 
with his name'.

Dear Moor, 
I slaved away all day so as to have the afternoon free for the 
article and, when I came to light the gas, it burnt so low that the 
whole office had to stop work. At home it's been worse if anything 
for almost a week now; the prolonged spell of frost and fog has so 
increased the consumption of gas during the day that by the 
evening there's no pressure at all and hence no light. This makes 
it impossible for me to do the article today, and anyhow it may 
well gain by my having to wait until the day after tomorrow or 
Thursday, since the move from Ceuta against Tetuan should 
begin any day now.519 Admittedly, this will be pretty awful for you, 
•since it means you'll have to slave away tomorrow when you had 
D<jen counting on me. 
Siebel has been to Hamburg, where he was told by the literary 
Bohemians that 'Freiligrath has broken with Marx'. So you can see 
how Mr Kinkel is still carrying on the business of article-writing, 
self-advertising tittle-tattle even now that Mockel 3 is dead. Mr 
Strodtmann, presently on the Hamburg Freischütz, has apparently 
reverted to being a faithful disciple of Johann Gottfried.

Dear Engels, 
You do not appear to have read both Freiligrath's and Blind's 
statements in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung (supplement, of 
presumably 8, 9, 10 or 11 December). 3 This shows that the 
rumour that 'Freiligrath has broken with Marx' could have got 
about without Kinkel's help. 
I have had a meeting with Juch about the Stieber proceedings in 
Berlin517  (the charge against Eichhoff concerns only his comments 
about the communist trial—the case comes up on the 22nd—so 
that the whole of that trial will be re-enacted before the public i* n

etc., weren't so spineless, they could now take a lovely revenge); ^ e

IN LONDON

Dear Mrs Marx, 
I take the liberty today of sending you a dozen bottles of wine 
for the festive season in the hope that they will be to your liking 
and contribute to the FAMILY'S cheer. 
The champagne and Bordeaux (Château d'Arcins) can be drunk 
at once, while the port wine should be allowed to rest a little and 
won't be in proper condition until about New Year. 
I have been frankly annoyed here by the Freiligrath goings-on.b 
It's forever the same old thing with that belletristic lot; they always 
want the newspapers to pay them homage, always want their 
names kept before the public, and the most inept little couplet of 
their own devising is of greater moment to them than the most 
tremendous historical event. Since none of this is attainable unless 
organised by a coterie, it goes without saying that the latter 
becomes the prime requirement, and we poor communists are, 
alas,  completely useless in that respect; worse still, we are fully 
alive to the swindle, deride this organisation du succès,  and ourselves 
feel almost criminally averse to becoming popular personalities. 
Now it shows great stupidity if, for these reasons, such a poet feels 
ill at ease in such a party, for here there is absolutely none of the

competition which he is bound to encounter everywhere else—and 
it shows even greater stupidity if he throws in his lot with a bunch 
in which competition from a Kinkel is a foregone conclusion. Mais 
que voulez-vous?" In order to exist a poet requires incense, a great 
deal of incense, and Mrs Poet consumes even more. Competition 
or no competition, Mrs Poet will always be in raptures for the side 
which daily parades before the public her noble genius of a 
Ferdinand,  herself,  her interesting offspring, her cats, dogs, 
rabbits, canaries and other vermin, and indeed, showers them with 
Bengal lights, sentimentality and romantic lies. And what Mrs Poet 
wants,  Mr Poet must needs want also, and this all the more in that 
madame gives expression to his own innermost thoughts. Das 
Volk, INDEED! The Gartenlaube is a very different kind of paper, 
and unctuous Bettziech a very different kind of man from the 
communists. b After all in the Gartenlaube they still treat us as a 
poet's family and accord us a weekly mention, nor does crooked 
• Bettziech ever let slip an opportunity to pay us a little compliment 
or give us a puff.—-True, Kinkel is praised far more highly for his 
poetry, which is greatly inferior to ours, and they publish many 
more anecdotes about him, but the man is Bettziech's patron after 
all, and everything will come right in the end. And then, take the 
Schiller festival! These communists despise and deride Schiller, so 
how could one run a Schiller festival with them? But the Schiller 
festival is more important than all the rest of history put together 
and, after all, why was Schiller born a 100 years ago if not for us 
to write a cantata about him today? c 
And then there is the further consideration that the noble 
Ferdinand's poetry pretty well dried up years ago and the little he 
still manages to extract from his noddle is appallingly bad. This 
necessitates thinking up DODGES such as collected editions, etc., and 
that's something that can't be done every day. So, in order that 
one should not be forgotten, a puff becomes daily more of a 
necessity. Who, IN FACT, ever talked about Freiligrath between 1849 
and 1858? Nobody. It was Bettziech who first rediscovered this 
classic writer, who had been so lost from mind that he was used 
only as Christmas and birthday presents and no longer figured in 
literature but in the history of literature. And, of course, nobody 
was to blame for all this save Karl Marx, with his 'inspiration'. But 
once F. Freiligrath has been thoroughly warmed up by the incense

of the Gartenlaube, then you'll see what poetry will come bubbling out 
of him! 
How petty, shabby and paltry are the doings of these poets! 
Give me Siebel any day; he may be a rotten poet, but he does at 
least know that he is a thorough humbug and all he asks is to be 
allowed to advertise himself—nowadays a necessary procédé 
without which he would be a complete nonentity. 
But you really mustn't take all this bickering too much to heart. 
As a 'personage'a Freiligrath is bound sooner or later to betray 
weaknesses such as will put him into our hands when the time is 
ripe.  Meanwhile, no breach if it can be avoided. 
I am very sorry that I shan't be able to come up on Friday, but 
there are such a lot of changes going on here that yesterday, for 
instance, I had to slave away till 9.45 at night, and there can be no 
question of getting away.

[London,  28 March  1856] 
Dear  Mr  Engels, 
Moor wants  to know whether  you are  coming here  for Easter  as 
we would  all so  very much like.  In that case  he would  not  send 
you the  BLUE BOOKS. 38 Please drop  us a  line  to say  whether  you are 
coming. Then  we  could take  the  thing  to the  PARCELS COMPANY  on 
Monday.  I have just posted your article.522 Chaley3  is VERY  BUSY  with 
the KARS PAPERS  b and is dictating to a somewhat seedy-looking 
Pieper. What  do you  make  of the  scandals  in Berlin? Have  you 
read the  report from  the  Berlin correspondent 12 in today's Times?A 
Now  we  know  the  reason  for the  Kreuz-Zeitung's sackcloth-and-
ashes LEADERS. 
I also have  a bone  to pick just  now  with  the  Minister  of the 
Interiore about  the  little business  of my  inheritance.  You  will 
remember that  my  late uncle's' effects included  a mass  of letters 
and manuscripts belonging  to my  grandfather,g  who was War 
Minister  to the  Duke  of Brunswick.  The  Prussian State, with  Mr 
von Scharnhorst  for  intermediary,  had  already entered into 
negotiations with  my  father11 with  a view  to purchasing these 
manuscripts which contain material  on thq  military history  of the 
Seven Years War.300 Then along comes  my  brother—and  in the 
final statement relating  to the  estate  I find  the  following curious 
entry:  As  regards  the  books which were found,  the  Minister  of 
11 Karl Marx  - b K. Marx,  'The  Fall of Kars'.  - c Probably  G. B.  Wilkinson  - d 'From

State has, 'on grounds of piety', taken over the same for the sum 
of 10 talers. He had the comparatively worthless portion sold by 
auction in Brunswick for 11 talers and now, without asking, takes 
over, out of piety, the more valuable, which he has valued at 10 
talers,  but debits me with the cost of carriage from Brunswick to 
Berlin. Funny sort of piety! But now for the real casus belli. In 
addition, he gets Florencourt, the chief clerk, to write: 
'Besides the books, a large number of papers, amongst them a number of the 
late Landdrost von Westphalen's manuscripts—some on military history—have also 
come to light. The latter are, however^ for the most part exceedingly incomplete 
and defective and it seems improbable that the same are of any real literary 
interest.' 
So they imagine that, without sending me a legal inventory and 
without having the papers valued, they can appropriate them by a 
coup de main. I strongly suspect that my brother, fired by patriotic 
zeal, promptly presented the manuscripts to the State, the more so 
in view of my mother's a letter, in which she tells me she had 
already written to them about the value of the papers and asked 
what they intended to do with them. Their silence is very peculiar. 
He believes that I, like the rest of my submissive sisters,b will 
simply leave everything to him, the mighty 'Cheeef of the family. 
But there he's mistaken. 
I have begun by making 'discreet inquiries' so that bit by bit I 
can lay claim to my 'PROPERTY'. 
I shall be curious to see what they answer. With Berlin in its 
present state of excitation it would be very easy for us to create a 
scandal. But out of consideration for my mother we shall tread 
somewhat cautiously before we start one. 
We hope to see you here next week. 
With cordial regards, yours,

secretary. They have ousted me altogether with the chi-i-ief of the 
household. 
On Tuesday morning0  a cab stopped in front of our door, and 
who do you think stepped out? Conrad Schramm, whom we 
thought dead long ago. That FOOL Seiler had already written an 
obituary notice about him in the evening papers. The poor fellow 
is very very unwell. A real picture of misery. Yesterday Karl got 
him admitted to the German hospital, where he is being very well 
looked after for £1 a  WEEK.  In his mind, by the way, Schramm is 
the same as of old, just as he was in his early, good period, when 
we all liked him for his buoyancy and FRANKNESS. He is continually 
cracking very good jokes about God and the world. But of the 
latter, so he thinks, he must soon take his leave. Fortunately he 
has kept free of the 'American clarity' by which old Mirbach and 
mv brother Edgar distinguished themselves so very much. 
Karl will be writing tomorrow.d Warmest greetings from all of 
us.

JENNY MARX  TO ENGELS 525 
IN WATERLOO NEAR LIVERPOOL 
[London, about  14 August  1857] 
Dear  Mr  Engels, 
We are all so  pleased  to hear that  you are  getting better again 
and feeling stronger.  But  Moor still insists that  the  real  way to 
cure your illness  is prolonged dosage with iron.  He has  been 
conscientiously studying medicine  at the  Museum,3  and all  modern 
doctors prescribe  it and  rate  it above cod-liver  oil;  they  are  thus 
wholly  in agreement with English doctors  who,  after years  of 
practice, have come  to the  same opinion.  By the by, he  begs  you 
most urgently  not to  overtax your brain with  the  work  for  Dana. 
Loafing  and  dozing  and  doing nothing  are  just  as necessary  as 
IRON. 
No doubt  you  will have  had the two  further letters  he addressed 
to Manchester.b  One  contained NOTICES about ARMIES,  the  other 
about  the  Armada.180 
A few  evenings  ago  that clown Edgar Bauer came  to see us; 
truly  a dried cod—without  any  cod-liver  oil and on top of  that 
with pretensions  to wit So  frightful were  his  EFFORTS that  I almost 
fainted, while Karl  was  sick—not just figuratively  but in  fact. 
Jones  has  lost his  wife  and is now  happy  as a  sandboy;  he hails 
all INDIANS  as Kossuths and applauds the  INDIAN PATRIOTS. 526 His 
opponent,  the  high-minded Richard Hart,  a PAID  Urquhartist,  is 
now a lawyer  at the  Coal Hole. Karl heard  him  pleading there. 
I hope your next letter will bring  yet  more good news.  We are 
all so very anxious about  you. 
The wine suits  me  splendidly.  The  sherry  is truly excellent.  The 
port seems  not  quite  so good,  but I  like it particularly  on account 
of its sweetness.  It will put me to  rights again. 
With warm regards, 
Jenny Marx

JENNY MARX TO CONRAD SCHRAMM 3 
IN ST. HÉLIER, JERSEY 
[London,] 8 December [1857] 
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, 
Hampstead 
Dear Mr Schramm, 
It is so long since we have heard from you that we are all most 
eager for news. We often talk about you and, more keenly than 
anything else, regret our inability to help beguile and enliven 
somewhat your long, solitary winter days and hours. 
If it isn't too much trouble, do let us have a sign of life some 
time.—What do you feel about the general mess? Wouldn't you 
say there was something really quite exhilarating about the way 
the rotten old structure is crashing and tumbling down? It is to be 
hoped that your relations aren't yet using the crisis as a pretext for 
turning their backs on you and hence that you yourself have not 
as yet suffered any material ill-effects. Though the American crisis 
has touched our purse all too appreciably, in as much as Karl is 
writing for the Tribune only once instead of twice a week, all its 
European correspondents except Bayard Taylor and Karl having 
been given their notice, you can nevertheless imagine how  HIGH  UP 
the Moor is. He has recovered all his wonted facility and capacity 
for work, as well as the liveliness and buoyancy of a spirit long 
since blighted by great sorrow, the loss of our beloved child,0 
whose death I shall never cease to mourn in my heart. By day 
Karl works for his living and by night at the completion of his 
political economy.250  Now, when the times require this work, and it 
has come to be a necessity, it will, no doubt, find some wretched 
publisher. Already not only we, but also Lupus and Steffen have 
felt the immediate impact of the crisis. The former has lost the 
better part of his lessons because the house has gone bankrupt, 
and the latter was no longer able to remain in Brighton because 
the Indian business 178 put an abrupt end to his instruction of the 
Indian CADETS. On top of that, his sister lost what little money she 
had through the faillite* of a banker. Little Dronke has started up

a business of his own in Glasgow. I believe that all the ranting in 
the Glaswegian press against 'unscrupulous people who start up 
businesses without any capital whatsoever' is directed against the 
little fellow. For the moment Freiligrath is still securely ensconced 
in his diminutive Credit mobilier. But if the sinister rumours 
about the Parisian Crédit mobilier and its steady decline prove 
true,  he too will soon go tumbling after and have to bid farewell to 
his manager's desk. So far, the crisis would not appear to have 
made any deep impression on our good, honest friend Liebknecht, 
or at least n'a-t-elle pas encore frappé son physique'; he still retains 
unimpaired his notorious, fearsome, famous, fabulous appetite 
and his pristine love for a RASHER  [OF]  BACON. 
Yesterday we heard from Engels in Manchester. b He says: 
Among our local philistines the crisis has induced a strong 
desire for the bottle, no one can bear to stay at home, alone with 
his cares and his family, the clubs are livening up, and the 
consumption of liquor is rising sharply. The worse of a jam a chap 
is in, the more frenzied his efforts to cheer himself up. And then, 
the morning after, what more striking example of remorse, both 
alcoholic and moral! In Manchester, 8 or 9 manufacturers have 
already come a cropper in the past few days. But nowhere do 
things look so splendid as in Hamburg. Never has panic assumed 
so perfect and classic a form. The house of Ulberg and Cramer, 
whose debts when they failed amounted to 12,000,000 banco 
marks (of which 7 million were bills on themselves!), had a capital 
of not more than 300,000 marks!! Everything there is now 
worthless, utterly worthless, save for silver and gold. Last week 
also saw the failure of Christian Matthias Schröder. J. H. Schröder 
& Co. in London telegraphed saying that, if 2 million marks would 
be enough, he would send the equivalent in silver. Came the 
reply: 3 millions or nothing; he couldn't spare the 3 millions and 
Christian Matthias crashed. The big American house which, after 
2 days of negotiation with the Bank of England, recently obtained 
a million-pound advance, thereby saving its skin, belonged to Mr 
Peabody. 
This 4th JULY ANNIVERSARY DINNER MAN246  calls to mind that lout 
Heinzen. Although the crisis has whittled down his Pionier to half 
its former size (despite the collaboration of student Karl Blind, 
that greatest of revolutionary statesmen), the rascal still continues 
to maintain that 'crises are mere Marxian inventions and figments 
of the brain'. Again, this gobbler-up of communists calls to mind 
•' it has not yet affected him physically - b See this volume, pp. 211-13.

red Becker," who has now been released, and this means, dear 
Mr Schramm, that willy-nilly you will have to make giant strides 
across the ocean with me, from Europe to America and back 
again, since with red Becker we are back once more in the dear 
Fatherland, the violet which will not, on this occasion, escape with 
a black, or rather blue, eye—back, indeed, in dear old Cologne, so 
that I cannot resist telling you something about our old friend 
Mevissen and his family. Quite a short while since, old Leiden lost 
2 children from consumption, then Mrs Mevissen, while one of his 
sons lost his life when the Pacifique went down. 
You can imagine how sullen and sulky all the democrats are at 
the moment. For now that they are again faced with the much 
abhorred knife-and-fork problem, and can no longer lay all the 
blame on princes and tyrants, there must needs be an end to 
political fiddle-faddle and ale-house oratory. 
But now my chatter has lasted so long that it's time for me to 
bid you adieu. Warmest regards from myself and the girls, who 
are growing up to be so sweet and lovable and charming.

JENNY MARX TO ENGELS 527 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, 9 April 1858] 
Dear Mr Engels, 
For the past week Karl has been so unwell as to be quite 
incapable of writing. He believes you will already have deduced 
from the laboured style of his most recent letter3 that his bile and 
liver are again in a state of rebellion. I trust his medicines will 
finally take effect. The worsening of his condition is largely 
attributable to mental unrest and agitation which now, of course, 
after the conclusion of the contract with the publisher b are greater 
than ever and increasing daily, since he finds it utterly impossible 
to bring the work to a close. I now also intend to write straight 
away to the little Berlin Jewc  who this time has proved a CLEVER 
manager. The children are well. Unfortunately they had to stay 
indoors all through the Easter holidays. The weather was too 
ghastly and the perpetual rain made our clayey soil so soft and 
muddy that it was like having the whole of Böckeburg clinging to 
one's soles. The Guardians with the two very interesting articles on 
France arrived today. From this we gather that you, too, are in 
Manchester and haven't risked an Easter  TRIP.  But fox-hunting no 
doubt? 
Warmest regards from us all.

TO FERDINAND LASSALLE 528 
IN BERLIN 
London, 9 April 1858 a 
Dear Mr Lassalle, 
Since Karl last wrote to youb the liver complaint from which he 
was already suffering at the time—unfortunately it recurs every 
spring—has got so much worse that he has had to dose himself 
constantly. Today he feels quite incapable of writing and has 
therefore asked me to convey to you his heartfelt thanks for your 
kind efforts on his  behalf.  Nor can I help but express my pleasure 
at the successful conclusion of the contract, from which I gather 
that you are not yet completely engrossed in theoretical works and 
that, besides immersing yourself in Heraclitus (which I, too, have 
been studying a little), you have still retained your practical 
aptitudes and remained, as the English say, 'A  CLEVER  MANAGER'. Karl 
would long since have written to you at length about your work, 
but it's so difficult for him to write at all. The mental unrest and 
agitation he feels through not being able to bring his work to a 
close all at one go contribute greatly, of course, to the aggravation 
of his condition, likewise the tiresome work for our 'DAILY BREAD', 
which is another thing that certainly can't be deferred. However 
we hope that he'll be able to deliver the manuscript0 on 
time. 
As soon as he feels a little better he will write to you and, in the 
meantime, perhaps you will make do with this brief note of mine. 
With warm regards

JENNY MARX TO MARX 529 
IN MANCHESTER 
[London, about 9 May 1858] 
My darling Karl, 
I'm sorry I haven't anything better to send you than  Sch[...] a 
Roller'sb letter; I kept it back yesterday but maybe you ought to 
see it after all. 
I hope that you will reach some definite POINT OF FACT with 
Friedländer; nothing much is ever to be got out of a German 
newspaper and it's beyond me how you could ask the enormous 
rate of £1 10/- for more than one article, especially since they 
have a correspondent 254 for their regular BUSINESS; they certainly 
can't want more than an enjolivement? The most that can be 
extracted from the  Presse,  as an AVERAGE MAXIMUM, will be £2—don't 
delude yourself on that score. Engels is sure to say 'you'll be able 
to make at least £10 a week out of it'; though such delusions may 
be very agreeable at the time, they are often doomed to 
disappointment in the event. 
The course of the revolution in Prussia336  tickles me tremend­
ously; particularly the 'ships, sails, masts and [waves]' speech made 
by liquor Prince Smith on his Baltic estate, and the rapturous 
applause it received. And on top of that the Kölnische Zeitung's 
transports over von der Heydt, and the admiration evinced even 
by the Presse for the energy and determination shown by the 
democratic press in Berlin??!! 
The girls would have written to you long ago, but little 
Jenny declared that she detested the idea of what was simply a 
private letter being subjected to threefold censorship. Hence her 
silence.

Dear Mr Engels, 
Moor has just gone to the Museuma  and has asked me to thank 
you for the £5 note you sent so promptly. And now, on top of all 
our other misfortunes, comes the COUNTY  COURT.  The affair's all the 
more vexing because I arrived just 5 minutes too late, otherwise 
the judge would certainly have granted me the right to make 
monthly payments as on the first occasion. You cannot conceive, 
dear Mr Engels, how painful it is for Karl and me to be such a 
constant burden on you and, with every letter, to despatch a fresh 
jeremiad appealing to your friendship and kindness. 
Karl has had 6 copies of Po and Rhine for some time now. He 
forgot to tell you. Of those 6 copies he has given away 3 to 
acquaintances (Imandt, Juta and Cavanagh). I shall be sending you 
the rest next week.

otherwise gloomy holiday, and will ensure a merry Christmas Eve. 
The sparkling bubbles of the champagne will make the dear 
children forget the lack of a little Christmas tree this year, and be 
happy and jolly for all that. 
I have been terribly irritated by fleshy philistine Freiligrath and 
his Westphalian rectitude and respectability. On the other hand I 
was greatly amused today by your letter about the fat man and the 
lean woman,3  and I cannot understand why I sometimes let the 
wretches' behaviour upset me so. Had we been 'BETTER OFF' this 
year, I'd have seen the funnier side of all this trouble, but humour 
goes by the board when one is constantly having to struggle 
against the pettiest misère; never have I found it so oppressive as 
now, when our dear little girls, who are blossoming so sweetly, 
have to endure it too. And then, on top of that, the secret hopes 
we had long nourished in regard to Karl's book b were all set at 
naught by the Germans' conspiration de silence, only broken by a 
couple of wretched, belletristic feuilleton articles which confined 
themselves to the preface and ignored the contents of the book. 
The second instalment 473 may startle the slugabeds out of their 
lethargy and then they will attack its line of thought the more 
ferociously for having kept silent about the scientific nature of the 
work. Nous verrons! 1 I am, too, particularly curious to see what 
Ephraim Artful d is going to hatch out. For his conduct in the 
matter is not altogether clear; Prussian Blue, like Ferdinand the 
Pure, e must be treated with great circumspection just now. and an 
official breach with the latter must still be postponed. He's only so 
thick with Blind because the latter was his MANSERVANT in the great 
Kinkel affair and stood up for his rights on the boozy Schiller 
committee. Because Blind helped by seeing to it that the bust of 
Schiller was unveiled (the green serge cover positively refused to 
come off until 4 men had tugged at and tussled with it) during his 
cantata' and not during the  LOW  COMEDIANS  SEMAPHORING, 8 he now has 
to stand publicly side by side with the arrant liar and cover the 
latter's mendacity and cowardice with his own political loyalty and 
purity. Fazy's miserable lackey! But enough of these dratted 
people! I am also sending you my brother's bookh through

review. Actually mon cher frère'' has virtually done us out of the 
legacy and it was a downright lie when he wrote and told me some 
years ago that these papers were nothing but useless disjointed 
notes with which absolutely nothing could be done, and which 
didn't even have any 'exchange value'. b I have ample cause to pick 
a quarrel with him, nor would anything be easier, in view of his 
present precarious political position, than to compromise him 
thoroughly. The Schleinitzes and Dunckers would be glad to take 
up the matter. Well, last week, without Karl's knowledge, I 
approached him about money. Since every attempt Karl had made 
to raise money had failed, I resolved in this extreme EMERGENCY to 
take the unpleasant step which I had hitherto avoided, even in the 
darkest days. Although Ferdinand refused to make me an 
'advance', 'himself restricted to his pension', my letter has put me 
in a FALSE POSITION in regard to him, and my hands are completely 
tied. For the present I shall have to confine myself to reproaching 
him for the peculiar way he has treated my father0 in the preface. 
Even the crazy, egoistic brother,*1 who embittered my father's 
existence and, up to the last year of his life, extorted from my 
mother6 a yearly allowance paid out of her small widow's income, 
is dealt with better, more decently and in greater detail than our 
humane, truly noble and magnanimous father. The latter, it is 
true,  'knew his Shakespeare better than his Bible', a crime which is 
not forgiven him even in the grave by his pietistic113 son. 
Moreover it was exceedingly strange that, touching as he did on 
our family circumstances, he should have omitted all mention of 
my father's second marriage and failed to name the second 
mother, who was the light of my father's life and who tended and 
nurtured her step-children with loyalty and love and devotion 
such as a woman's own children seldom meet with. This enabled 
him skilfully to cheat my brother Edgar and myself of her 
existence which he found intrusive. But this last is a matter of 
complete indifference and affects me very little; only father and 
mother should not have been treated and passed over in this 
way—and for that he must do penance. I am anxious to know 
what you will have to say about the military part of the book.

1 This letter was first published in an abridged English translation in Karl Marx 
and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence. 1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary

2 This refers to Robert Cobden's pamphlet What Next and Next? published in 
London in early 1856. It attacked Britain's foreign policy during the Crimean 
War waged by Britain, France, Turkey and Piedmont against Russia (1853-56). 
In particular, Cobden condemned die draft peace treaty with Russia as failing 
to guarantee stable peace.—3 
3 This presumably refers to Marx's articles on the Danubian Principalities of 
Moldavia and Wallachia written for the New-York Daily Tribune. As can be seen 
from Marx's letter to Engels of 22 September 1856 (this volume, p. 68), they 
were not published, and have never been found. The articles touched on 
Swedish history, probably in connection with the conclusion on 21 November 
1855 of a defence treaty aimed at Russia between the Kingdom of Sweden and 
Norway on die one hand, and Britain and France on the other. 
Marx contributed to the New-York Daily Tribune from August 1851 to 
March 1862. At his request many of the articles for the Tribune were written by 
Engels. In fact it was not until August 1852 that Marx began sending his own 
articles. By agreement with the editors some of the articles dealing with 
individual European countries were datelined Paris, Berlin or Vienna (see this 
volume, pp. 352, 361, 368 and 410). 
Marx's and Engels' articles in the New-York Daily Tribune dealt with key 
issues of foreign and domestic policy, the working-class movement, the 
economic development of European countries, colonial expansion, and the 
national liberation movement in colonial and dependent countries. Many of 
them were reprinted in die Tribunes special editions—the New-York Weekly 
Tribune and the New-York Semi-Weekly Tribune—and were quoted by other 
American newspapers, in particular by The New-York Times. Some were 
reproduced in the Chartist Peoples Paper, London. The Tribune editors 
sometimes took liberties with the articles, printing them unsigned in the form 
of editorials, and making insertions, some of which were in direct contradiction 
to the content of the articles (see, e.g., this volume, pp. 81 and 100-01). A

number of articles were not printed at all. Marx repeatedly protested against 
these practices. In the autumn of 1857 he was forced to reduce the number of 
his contributions in view of the Tribune's financial difficulties resulting from the 
economic crisis in the USA. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, he 
ceased contributing altogether, mainly because the Tribune had come under the 
sway of people who advocated a compromise with the slave-owning states and 
abandoned its initial progressive stand.—3, 68, 73, 81 
4 Marx quotes a leading article from The Times, No. 22267, of 18 January 1856, 
which discussed the preliminary conditions for a peace treaty with Russia. The 
paper commented on the report, received the day before, about Russia's 
acceptance of the peace proposals put to her by her opponents in the Crimean 
war, and urged extensive military preparations to force Russia into 'uncondi­
tional acceptance' of the demands made on her.—3 
5 A congress held at the Romanian town of Foc$ani in July and August 1772 
aimed at ending the Russo-Turkish war started by Turkey in 1768. The 
Russian delegation proposed, in particular, that Wallachia and Moldavia should 
be granted independence under the joint protection of the European powers. 
No agreement having been reached at the congress, hostilities were resumed 
and continued until 1774.—3 
6 This refers to an episode in the Russo-Turkish war of 1735-39, which had been 
provoked by incursions, in 1735, of the Crimean Tartars into the Ukraine and 
the invasion of the Caucasus by the Crimean Khan, a vassal of the Sultan. In 
May-June 1736, a Russian army under Field Marshal B. C. Münnich entered 
the Crimea and occupied the Western part of the peninsula, including 
Bakhchisarai, the Khan's capital. However, a shortage of provisions, forage and 
water and the outbreak of epidemics forced Münnich to withdraw to the 
Ukraine.—3 
7 The principal works of Adam Müller, who belonged to the romantic school in 
political economy, are Die Elemente der Staatskunst. Theile I-III, Berlin, 1809 and 
Versuche einer neuen Theorie des Geldes mit  besonderer  Rücksicht auf Grossbritannien, 
Leipzig und Altenburg, 1816. Marx discussed Müller's views in Vols. I and III 
of Capital (present edition, Vols. 31 and 33).—4 
8 Synoptics—the writers of the first three Gospels. Marx refers to Bruno Bauer's 
book Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker. Bd. 1-2, Leipzig, 1841; 
Bd. 3, Braunschweig, 1842.—4 
9 On 19 January 1856, David Urquhart's Free Press (No. 15) published under the 
heading 'The Chartist Correspondence' a number of documents on the 
Chartists' activities in  1839-41,  including Urquhart's correspondence with the 
then British Prime Minister Lord Melbourne, Home Secretary Normanby and 
others. The letters show that Urquhart had abused the Chartist leaders' trust by 
giving the British government detailed information of Chartist plans and 
intentions. 
While publishing some works attacking the foreign policy of the British 
ruling circles, in particular that of Lord Palmerston, leader of the Whig 
oligarchy, in The Free Press and other Urquhartite publications, Marx 
emphatically dissociated himself from Urquhart's conservative views and 
criticised them in the press.—4 
0 This refers to Engels' duties as corresponding clerk and general assistant in 
the Ermen & Engels firm in Manchester, of which his father was co-owner. He

assumed the post in the early 1850s, largely because he wanted to be able to 
give material aid to the Marx family, and kept it until 1870. Engels' confidential 
business reports to his father mentioned in die letter have not come down to 
us.—5 
1 ' Between January and May 1856 Engels wrote a series of articles on Pan-Slavism 
for the New-York Daily Tribune, which did not print them. The manuscripts 
have not been preserved.—5, 14, 51, 68, 73, 81, 100 
12 Further in his letter Engels cites facts showing that opposition to Napoleon Ill's 
regime in France was mounting. Marx used them in his article 'The American 
Difficulty.—Affairs of France', published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 25 
February 1856 (present edition, Vol. 14, pp. 602-04).—5 
3 Sire de Franc Boissy—a French song containing satirical allusions to royalty and 
the government.—6 
4 A reference to the repressions that were part of the Bonapartist coup d'état of 
2 December 1851 in France.—6 
5 Engels here refers to the discussion of the so-called Five Points or preliminary 
terms for peace between Russia and the coalition that fought Russia in the 
Crimean war (Britain, France, Turkey and Piedmont). The Five Points were 
presented to the Russian government through Austria in the form of an 
ultimatum by the Allied Powers in December 1855. They called for 
replacement of the Russian protectorate over the Danubian principalities by a 
protectorate of all the contracting parties, a revision of the Bessarabian border 
involving Russia's relinquishment of the territory along the Danube, neutralisa­
tion of the Black Sea, closure of the Straits to warships, a ban on the 
maintenance by Russia and Turkey of arsenals and navies in the Black Sea, and 
collective protection of the Sultan's Christian subjects by the Great Powers. The 
Allied Powers also reserved themselves the right to impose additional demands. 
The terms were accepted by the Russian government and provided the basis 
for the Paris peace talks. 
The Turkish fortress of Kars in Transcaucasia was captured, after a long 
siege, by the Russians on 28 November 1855. The fall of Kars, the last major 
event of the Crimean war, speeded up the termination of hostilities. Under the 
Paris peace treaty (March 1856) Kars was returned to Turkey in exchange for 
the evacuation of Sevastopol and the other Russian towns held by die 
Allies.—7,  21 
6 The Aliens Bill audiorised the deportation of aliens from England at any time 
by decision of the British government. Enacted by Parliament in 1793, it was 
valid for one year and was renewed in 1802, 1803, 1816, 1818 and, in 
connection with revolutionary events on the Continent and Chartist demonstra­
tions in England, in 1848. In later years too, conservative circles repeatedly 
sought its renewal. In particular, the question was discussed for several months 
from the autumn of 1855, following the publication on 10 October by 
L'Homme, a refugee newspaper appearing in Jersey, of an open letter by the 
French petty-bourgeois democrat Félix Pyat to Queen Victoria on the occasion 
of her visit to France in August of that year. The letter sharply attacked 
Britain's alliance with the Second Empire and was used as a pretext for the 
expulsion of the publisher of L'Homme and some other French refugees from 
the island and for press attacks on refugees in general. However, protests by 
progressive circles forces the authorities to refrain from further steps. On

17 This may be an ironic reference to Richard Wagner, who—in his Das Kunstwerk 
der Zukunft (1856) and other writings—called his works the 'music of the 
future',—8 
18 Marx refers to the diplomatic correspondence between Pozzo di Borgo, the 
Russian Ambassador to France, and Count Nesselrode, the Russian Chancellor 
of State. Marx knew of it from diplomatic documents published under the tide 
The Portfolio, or a Collection of State Papers by David Urquhart in London from 
1835 to 1837, and from the book Recueil des documents relatifs à la Russie pour la 
plupart secrets et inédits utiles à consulter dans la crise actuelle, Paris, 1854.—9 
19 This work, intended by Engels for Putnam's Monthly, which published his series 
The Armies of Europe in the second half of 1855, was presumably never

21 Queen's Bench—here the reference is to a London jail intended mainly for 
insolvent debtors.— 13 
22 Marx means The Lay of Igor's Host, a monument of old Russian literature 
describing the ill-starred campaign undertaken by Igor, Prince of Novgorod 
Severski, against the nomadic Polovtsians in 1185. The work was published in 
German several times. One edition appeared in Berlin in 1854 under the title 
Lied vom Heerzuge Igors. As follows from Marx's later letters to Engels, he found 
the Lay, in the language of the original and in French translation, in 
F. G. Eichhoff's book Histoire de la langue et de la littérature des slaves..., and later 
also a bilingual German edition, which he sent to Engels in Manchester.—15, 
19, 26, 31, 37 
23 Acta litteraria Bohemiae et Moraviae, Pragae, 1774-1783, were literary and 
historical collections published by the Czech Enlightenment historian Mikulâs 
(Adauctus) Voigt. —16 
24 Marx means Schlözer's recommendations, quoted on p. 261 of Dobrovsky's 
book, for the study of the Slavonic languages and the compilation of Slavonic 
dictionaries. The recommendations are contained in Schlözer's book Allgemeine 
Nordische Geschichte, p. 330.—16 
25 Dobrovsky's words, taken from his book Slavin (p. 419), actually refer to Acta 
litteraria Bohemiae et Moraviae published by Mikulâs (Adauctus) Voigt, not to 
Johannes Voigt's Geschichte Preußens.— 16 
26 Archdeacon William Coxe, traveller, historian and writer, left his vast collection 
of manuscripts and books to the British Museum. Marx made excerpts from 
the following manuscript letters and reports of British diplomats in Russia: 
Various Papers on the Genius and Character of the Russians, Rondeau to Walpole, 
Dispatch from Mr. Fuch (Finch) to Lord Harrington, Sir George Macartney to the Earl 
of Sandwich, and Sir James Harris to Lord Grantham. He made ample use of them 
in his Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century (see present edition, 
Vol. 15).—17

27 Polovtsians (Kipchaks or Cumans) —Turkic nomadic tribes who inhabited the 
South-Russian steppes from the eleventh to the thirteenth century. Following 
the Mongol invasion in the mid-thirteenth century some of them fled to 
Hungary and the Balkans, where they were absorbed, while those remaining 
were subjugated by the conquerors and merged with the peoples inhabiting the 
Golden Horde, the medieval Tartar-Mongol state.—19 
28 This refers to the so-called Königinhof manuscript, a collection of patriotic poems 
glorifying Bohemian antiquity, which the Czech philologist and poet Vaclav 
Hanka claimed to have discovered in a church in the village of Krâlowé Dwoîe 
(in German: Königinhof) in 1817. It was published in Czech under the title 
Kralodvorsky Rukopis in 1819, and in 1829 in Czech and in German, translated 
by the Czech poet Vaclav Alois Swoboda. Marx probably had the latter edition 
in mind. 
In the 1880s the manuscript was revealed to be a recent imitation.—19, 26 
29 This apparendy refers to 'Bogarodzica', a medieval Polish hymn to the Virgin 
first recorded in 1407. It is attributed to Adalbert (Wojciech), Bishop of Prague 
(957-997).—19 
30 Chambre introuvable was the name given by King Louis XVIII to the French 
Chamber of Deputies, which in 1815-16 consisted of extreme conservatives. It 
attacked the government from the right and was eventually disbanded by the 
King because of its arch-reactionary views. 
Here Marx calls the Prussian Chamber of Representatives Chambre 
introuvable because it was dominated by the Junkers, whose extreme reactionary 
attitudes were worrying the government which feared they might provoke 
revolutionary tendencies.—20 
31 The expression 'the crazy year' ('das tolle Jahr') was first used by Johann 
Heinrich von Falkenstein in a chronicle published in 1739 to describe the 
popular unrest in Erfurt in 1509. Later it was widely used in literature to 
designate the revolutionary year 1848.—20 
32 This refers to the struggle in the French "National Convention (which met on 
20 September 1792) between the Girondists, i.e. the party of the big bourgeoisie 
(a number of whose leaders came from the department of Gironde), and the 
Montagnards, commonly referred to as the Mountain, who occupied the upper 
seats in the Convention, i.e. the Jacobins, which represented the progressive 
bourgeoisie and the masses. As a result of the popular uprising of 31 May-2 
June 1793, the Girondist government was overthrown and the Jacobin 
revolutionary democratic dictatorship was established.—21 
33 The words 'take- care of Dowb' were originally used by, and then popularly 
added to the name of, the British Secretary of War Panmure who, in an official 
dispatch of June 1855 informing General Simpson of his appointment as 
commander-in-chief in the Crimea, asked him to look after Panmure's nephew, 
the young officer Dowbiggin.—21 
34 At the battle of Inkerman in the Crimea (5 November 1854) the Anglo-French 
forces defeated the Russian army, but the latter's vigorous action prevented the 
Allies from storming Sevastopol, to which they lay siege instead. Engels 
describes the battle in detail in his article 'The Battle of Inkerman' (see present 
edition, Vol. 13, pp. 528-35).—21, 178, 297 
35 From 1846 to 1854 Ferdinand Lassalle handled Countess Sophie von 
Hatzfeldt's divorce suit against Count Edmund Hatzfeldt-Wildenburg. The

divorce was agreed to in July 1851. Later, the countess received 300,000 talers 
under the property settlement.—23, 27, 227 
36 Gustav Levy's visit to Marx in London in late February 1856 was preceded by 
another, in the second half of December 1853, when he also came with a 
message from Düsseldorf workers. This shows that after the 1848-49 revolution 
the proletarian circles in the Rhine Province continued to regard Marx and 
Engels as their leaders. Already during his first visit Levy maintained that an 
uprising was needed in Germany and that the factory workers were ready for 
it. Marx, then too, argued that, with reaction rampant in Germany, an uprising 
would be premature, as would a resumption of the activities of the Communist 
League in Germany urged by Levy.—25 
37 The letter is only dated 'Tuesday', but Marx's intention, mentioned in the 
letter, to send an article on Kars to New York on Friday is evidence that the 
letter was written on Tuesday, 25 March, since the article appeared in the 
New-York Daily Tribune on 8 April 1856 and had to be mailed in London not 
later than Friday, 28 March, to arrive in time for that issue.—28 
38 Blue Books—periodically published collections of documents of the British 
Parliament and Foreign Office. Their publication began in the seventeenth 
century.—28, 120, 431, 561 
39 'Enclosure 2' has been preserved. Written in Jenny Marx's hand, it is the record 
of a talk she had with Colonel Touroute,/ who related a number of facts 
compromising Lassalle. He pointed out, in particular, that the extravagant life 
Lassalle led in Countess Hatzfeldt's house, his use of her money for 
stock-exchange speculation, his arrogance towards workers, his self-assurance 
and dictatorial demeanour roused the indignation of the Düsseldorf workers.— 
31, 36 
40 Boustrapa—nickname of Louis Bonaparte, composed of the first syllables of the 
names of the places where he and his supporters staged Bonapartist putsches: 
Boulogne (August 1840), Strasbourg (October 1846) and Paris (coup d'état of 
2 December  1851).—31,  94, 170, 230, 256, 290, 336, 425, 435 
41 Marx drew on Tassilier's letter for his article 'The France of Bonaparte the 
Little' (present edition, Vol. 14, pp. 615-20). Cayenne, in French Guiana, South 
America, a place of penal servitude for political prisoners, was dubbed the 'Dry 
Guillotine' on account of the high mortality among convicts caused by the harsh 
prison regulations and the unhealthy tropical climate. A translation of 
Tassilier's letter, sent by Marx to the Chartist People's Paper, was published on 
12 April 1856.—31 
42 Marx means the polemics between the Chartists and the Urquhartites, which 
had been exacerbated by the publication in Urquhart's Free Press (19 January 
1856) of 'The Chartist Correspondence' (see Note 9). The Urquhartites' hostility 
towards the revolutionary trend in the British working-class movement found 
expression in attempts to represent the Chartists as demagogues and agents of the 
Russian Tsar. The Chartists, for their part, described the Urquhartites as 
reactionaries advocating a restoration of the customs and practices of the Middle 
Ages.  A sharp controversy developed, in particular, over the future of Parliament. 
The Chartists held that it should be reformed on democratic principles and used 
as an instrument of social change, whereas the Urquhartites advocated total 
abolition of the representative system and a return to patriarchal forms of 
government.—32, 44

43 In February and March 1856 Ernest Jones, the Chartist leader, attempted to 
reorganise the activities of the National Charter Association. Writing in The 
People's Paper, he suggested that the Association should no longer hold 
conferences or elect leaders, but that he, Jones, and James Finlen should be 
recognised for life as the only members of its Executive. Jones believed that this 
form of centralisation would make for greater efficiency. His proposals were 
endorsed by the majority of the Chartist members, but led only to a temporary 
increase in membership (to about 2,000 by the beginning of March 1856) and 
local activation of Chartist propaganda. At the same time, Jones' attempts to act 
as the Association's only leader caused serious discontent among Manchester 
Chartists. 
Marx and Engels, who maintained close ties with revolutionary Chartists, 
criticised Jones' efforts to galvanise the Chartist movement by such artificial 
measures, which, they predicted, could not ensure lasting success.—  32, 34 
44 This refers to the German National Assembly convened in Frankfurt am Main in 
May 1848 for the purpose of unifying Germany and drawing up an Imperial 
Constitution. Its mostly liberal deputies turned the Assembly into a mere 
debating club. In early June 1849 the Right-wing deputies and the moderate 
liberals left the Assembly after the Prussian King and other German monarchs 
had rejected the Constitution it had drafted. What remained of the Assembly 
moved to Stuttgart, where it was dispersed by Württemberg troops on 18 June 
1849. 
The petty-bourgeois democrat Löwe von Calbe was a deputy to the 
Assembly in 1848-49.—32, 63 
45 Engels means the establishment of banks similar to the Société générale du Crédit 
mobilier, a big French joint-stock bank founded by the Péreire brothers in 1852. 
The Crédit mobilier was to mediate in credit transactions and help in setting up 
industrial concerns and building railways in France, Spain, Austria, Russia and 
other countries. It was closely associated with Napoleon Ill's government and 
under its protection engaged in large-scale speculation. It went bankrupt in 
1867 and was liquidated in 1871.—34, 68, 119, 126, 128, 133, 142, 145, 216, 
225, 231, 240, 244, 291, 296, 349, 360, 437 
^ At the battle of Jena (14 October 1806) the French army, commanded by 
Napoleon, routed the Prussian army, thus forcing Prussia to surrender. 
At Austerlitz (Czech name: Slavkov) Napoleon's army defeated the Austrians 
and Russians on 2 December 1805.—37, 170, 180, 461 
47 Marianne, founded in 1850, was a secret republican society which opposed 
Napoleon III during the Second Empire.—37, 42 
48 On 14 April 1856 Marx was invited as an official representative of the 
revolutionary refugees in London to a banquet commemorating the fourth 
anniversary of the Chartist People's Paper. In his address he spoke of the 
German and other proletarian revolutionaries' solidarity with the revolutionary 
wing of the Chartist movement, concentrating in particular on the historic role 
of the proletariat. The banquet was also addressed by the German Communist 
Wilhelm Pieper. The other speakers were mostly Chartists (James Finlen, 
Ernest Jones and others). Marx did not intend to publish his speech, but it was 
included in the newspaper report that appeared on 19 April 1856 under the 
heading 'Fourth Anniversary Banquet of The People's Paper' (present edition, 
Vol. 14, pp. 655-56).—38

Straubingers —German travelling journeymen. Marx and Engels often ironically 
gave the name to backward elements of the German working-class movement 
who were still influenced by guild prejudices and mistrusted the revolutionary 
intelligentsia.—38 
A reference to the German Workers' Educational Society in London, which was 
founded in February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other leaders of 
the League of the Just (in the 1850s the Society had its premises in Windmill 
Street, Soho). After the reorganisation of the League of the Just in the summer 
of 1847 and the founding of the Communist League, the latter's local 
communities played a leading role in the Society. In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx 
and Engels took an active part in the Society's work, but on 17 September 1850 
they and a number of their followers withdrew because the Willich-Schapper 
sectarian and adventurist faction had temporarily increased its influence in the 
Society and caused a split in the Communist League. Later Schapper realised the 
faultiness of his position and took steps towards a reconciliation with Marx. The 
resultant weakening of the sectarians' influence made it possible for Marx and 
Engels to resume their work in the Educational Society in the late 1850. In 1918, 
the Society was closed down by the British government.—41, 363, 451, 
520 
This refers to the German republican democrats who, following the capture of 
the fortress of Mainz by the French army in October 1792, formed the Friends 
of Liberty and Equality Society on the pattern of the Jacobin Club. The Mainz 
Clubbists joined the new administration (the Mainz Commune) and carried out 
a number of progressive reforms (abolition of feudal obligations, social-estate 
privileges and the guild system). Under the Clubbists' influence, the Rhenish 
German National Convention, convoked in Mainz in March 1793, proclaimed 
the merger of Mainz with the French Republic. The Clubbists' activity was 
violendy terminated in July 1793, when the French army was driven out by the 
forces of the counter-revolutionary European coalition.—41 
In his letter of 6 April 1856 Johannes von Miquel, a former member of the 
Communist League, asked Marx to state his views on the attitude the 
proletariat should take to bourgeois parties in the event of a revolution in 
Germany. Miquel's own statements on this question testified to a retreat from 
the consistendy revolutionary standpoint. He limited the tasks of the revolution 
to establishing a united centralised state and ignored the need for social 
change. He maintained that the proletariat should ally itself not only with the 
petty-bourgeois democrats but also with the bourgeois liberals and refrain from 
such revolutionary measures as might frighten the bourgeoisie away from the 
revolution. 
No answer by Marx to Miquel is extant.—42, 44 
On 8 April 1856 Count Walewski, Foreign Minister of France, made a 
counter-revolutionary speech at a plenary session of the Congress of Paris 
convened to work out the peace terms following the Crimean war. He declared 
that British and French troops would continue to occupy Greece, while French 
and Austrian troops would remain in the Papal states to combat 'anarchy' (i. e. 
the national liberation movement). He attacked the Belgian press, describing its 
support for the French republicans and criticism of Napoleon III as incitement 
to 'insurrection and murder'.—42

57 The Foreign Affairs Committees were public organisations set up by the 
Urquhartites in a number of English cities between the 1840s and 1860s, 
mainly with the aim of opposing Palmerston's policy.—44 
58 In 1856 Marx's series of articles Lord Palmerston, originally intended for and 
partly published in the New-York Daily Tribune (see present edition, Vol. 12), 
appeared in Sheffield under the title The Story of the Life of Lord Palmerston  ( The 
Free Press Serials, No. 5, 1856). This was a reproduction of the series as 
published under the same title between December 1855 and February 1856 in 
several issues of The Free Press, the Urquhartites' London paper. Apart from 
this, one of the articles, published in The Sheffield Free Press in November 1855, 
appeared as a pamphlet in Sheffield in 1856 (The Free Press Serials, 
No. 4a).—44, 58 
59 This refers to Heine's third will, which he dictated to notaries F. L. Ducloux 
and Ch. L. E. Rousse on 13 November 1851.—45 
60 Engels made excerpts from Bazancourt's book between June and September 
1856.  In the autumn of that year he summed up the results of his critical 
analysis in an article entitled 'Saint-Arnaud'. Marx sent the article to the 
American journal Putnam's Monthly, but the editors returned it unpublished.— 
45, 51, 71, 73, 80, 93, 106, 124, 126, 128 
61 This refers to a work planned by Marx on the history of-British and Russian 
diplomacy in the eighteenth century, of which he only completed five chapters 
of the Introduction. For these he made use of pamphlets, diplomatic 
documents and unpublished manuscripts, mostly of the period of the Northern 
War (the Russo-Swedish war of 1700-21), which he found in the British 
Museum Library. His negotiations with Nikolaus Trübner for publication of the 
work ended in failure. The chapters of the Introduction appeared by 
instalments in Urquhart's Sheffield Free  Press  from late June to early August 1856 
as they were sent in by Marx. Eventually publication was stopped because of 
arbitrary editorial abridgements and printing errors. In June 1856 the London 
Free Press began reprinting the text from the Sheffield paper, and on 16 
August 1856 it started reproducing the chapters from the beginning, with 
publication continuing until 1 April 1857. In both papers the unfinished work 
was printed under the title Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th 
Century (see present edition, Vol. 15). 
In 1899 Eleanor Aveling, Marx's daughter, published it in London in book 
form under the heading Secret Diplomatic History of the Eighteenth Century.—46,

64 Between 1845 and 1847 potato blight caused widespread famine in Ireland. 
The poverty of the small tenants ruthlessly exploited by the big landowners had 
made the bulk of the population almost entirely dependent on a diet of 
potatoes grown on their own small patches. About one million people starved to

death, and the wave of emigration caused by die famine swept away another 
million. Large areas of Ireland were depopulated. The abandoned land was 
turned into pastures by the English and Irish landlords.—49 
65 This refers to the mass eviction of Irish tenants, a policy pursued by the 
English and Irish landlords since the late 1840s to turn ploughland into 
pasture. It was stimulated by the falling demand for Irish corn owing to the 
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, and by England's growing need for Irish 
cattle and animal produce.— 50 
66 The Encumbered Estates Court was to enforce the Encumbered Estates Act for 
Ireland, passed by Parliament in 1849. This act was supplemented by a series of 
other acts in 1852 and 1853. The 1849 Act provided for the sale of mortgaged 
estates by auction if their owners were proved insolvent. As a result, the land of 
many ruined landlords passed into the hands of usurers, middlemen and rich 
tenants.—51 
67 Engels compares Bazancourt's description of the Crimean war to Bat-
rachomyomachia (The Battle of the Frogs and Mice), an Ancient Greek 
anonymous mock-heroic poem parodying Homer's  Iliad.—  51 
68 Marx and Wilhelm Pieper travelled to Hull on 7 June 1856. From there Marx 
went to see Engels in Manchester, while Pieper returned to London to carry

about 10 September 1856. She went there to visit her sick mother, Caroline von 
Westphalen, who died on 23 July. Marx's letter was sent from Manchester, 
where he was staying with Engels. —54 
70 Black Madonna—a name given by some art specialists to early wood carvings of 
the Virgin Mary. It was used, in particular, by Karl Friedrich von Rumohr in 
his book Italienische Forschungen (Berlin, 1827), from which Marx made 
excerpts in Bonn in 1842 for his planned treatise on Christian art.—54 
71 The Cologne Communist Trial (4 October-12 November 1852) was a trial of a 
group of Communist League members charged with 'treasonable conspiracy'. It 
was rigged by the Prussian police on the basis of forged documents and 
fabricated evidence, which were used not only against the accused but also to 
discredit the whole proletarian organisation. Seven of the twelve defendants 
were sentenced to prison terms of three to six years. Marx directed the defence 
from London, sending material revealing the provocative methods used by the 
prosecution. After the trial he and Engels exposed its organisers (see Engels' 
article 'The Late Trial at Cologne', published in the New-York Daily Tribune, 
and Marx's pamphlet Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, 
present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 388-93 and 395-457).—56, 69, 376, 477, 552

73 Only part of the draft of Marx's letter to Isaac Ironside, editor of The Sheffield 
Free Press, has reached us. The beginning, up to and including the words 'I 
shall consider myself obliged to stop the publication', is written in pencil in 
Engels' hand with changes in ink by Marx. The rest of the text, with much 
struck out, is in Marx's writing. That the draft was written on 21 June 1856 can 
be seen from Marx's letter to his wife written on the same day. Ironside 
answered the letter on 23 June 1856.—57

74 This refers to the publication of Marx's Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 
18th Century in The Sheffield Free Press (see Note 61). Further on Marx speaks 
of Ironside's intention to publish this work in the Urquhartites' Free Press 
Serials, an intention which failed to materialise.—57 
75 This letter was written in reply to one from William Cyples, a member of the 
Sheffield Free Press  staff,  which Marx reproduced, together with his reply, in a 
letter to Engels on 28 July 1856. Marx's relations with the newspaper had been 
complicated by the arbitrary changes made by the editors in his Revelations of 
the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century, which soon led him to stop publication 
of the work in this paper (see Note 61). 
The letter was first published in English as part of Marx's letter to Engels of 
28 July 1856 in Der Briefwechsel zwischen F. Engels und K. Marx. 1844 bis 1883.

76 The Friendly Societies were workers' organisations whose main purpose was to 
provide material aid to their members in the event of disability and old age, 
pay funeral expenses and the like. This was done out of membership dues.—59 
77 This refers to Marx's conflict with The Sheffield Free Press over the publication 
of his Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century (see Note 61). The 
following draft of a letter by Wilhelm Pieper to William Cyples has survived: 
'28 Dean Street, Soho 
London, 17 July 1856 
'Sir, 
'I am directed by Dr. Marx to inform you that he cannot congratulate you 
on the emendations you have thought fit to introduce in the copy destined for 
Saturday's publication. 
'Passages that might safely have been omitted—for the sake of space—have 
been carefully preserved, while the most characteristic portions analyzing the 
policy of Peter I have been suppressed. This explains why he has interpolated 
about three lines of absolute importance for the understanding of the reader, 
in substitution for the same number of lines suppressed in another place, out of 
consideration for the pressure of space you allege in your letter to 
Dr. Marx.'—60 
78 Marx means the concluding events of the fourth bourgeois revolution in Spain 
(1854-56): the resignation of Espartero's liberal government on 14 July 1856, 
the coming to power of the counter-revolutionary General O'Donnell, and the 
popular uprising, led by the ex-toreador Pucheta, against the new government 
in Madrid and a number of other cities. Espartero's refusal to support the 
insurgents and the weakness of their leaders contributed to the defeat of the 
movement. On 17 July the uprising was suppressed in Madrid and soon after in 
the other cities too. Marx described these events in his articles 'The Revolution 
in Spain' (see present edition, Vol. 15).—61 
79 The Grand Cophta was the name of an omnipotent and omniscient priest who 
headed the non-existent Masonic 'Egyptian Lodge' which die famous eigh­
teenth-century impostor 'Count' Cagliostro (Giuseppe Balsamo) claimed to have 
founded.—61 
80 Contrary to Urquhart's intention to reserve the new publication of Marx's 
Revelations of  the Diplomatic History of  the 18th Century for his projected journal, the 
five chapters of the Introduction that had been written were republished in The 
Free Press, the Urquhartites' London paper (see Note 61).—62

Crapauds (literally: toads) was the nickname of a group of opportunist deputies 
(the 'Bog') in the French Convention (1793-95) who vacillated between the 
Right and the Left wing. Marx and Engels in their letters often used the name 
in reference to French philistines, in particular French petty-bourgeois 
refugees, some of whom lived in Jersey until 1855 and later in Guernsey.—65,

In the second half of August Engels went to London to meet his mother, who 
was visiting England.—66, 72 
This refers to the legacy left to Jenny Marx by her mother, Caroline von 
Westphalen. Part of it consisted in shares which, at the time of the mother's 
death, were in the hands of her step-son, the Prussian Minister of the Interior 
Ferdinand von Westphalen.—68 
Georg Weerth died of jungle fever on 30 July 1856 in Havana while on a tour 
of West Indian countries as agent of a German commercial firm. Marx and 
Engels did not learn of their friend's death until much later.—68, 72 
Marx's information was inaccurate. The book on England, Englische Freiheit, 
was written not by Bruno, but by Edgar Bauer, Marx referred to it later in his 
letters to Engels of 18 March and 21 April 1857 (see this volume, pp. 106 and 
122).—68,  122 
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street—a name for the Bank of England situated 
in Threadneedle Street, London. 
By the Paris concern Marx means the Banque de France.—71 
An allusion to the French bankers Isaac and Emile Péreire, who in the 1820s 
and 1830s adhered to the Saint-Simonist school. In 1852 they set up the 
joint-stock bank, Crédit mobilier (see Note 45), which they falsely claimed gave 
effect to the Saint-Simonist idea of overcoming class contradictions and 
achieving prosperity for all by introducing a new, rational system of public 
credit. The practical application of the scheme, which had the support of 
Napoleon III and was called ironically 'Bonapartist socialism' by Marx, led to an 
orgy of stock-exchange speculation and corruption in France. 
Marx uses the term 'imperialism' further on in the sense of 'Bonapartism'.— 
72 
The Crystal Palace—a structure of metal and glass in London's Hyde Park built 
for the 1851 Great Exhibition and used for various displays and shows 
later.—72 
Marx used the data on the state of the European money market cited in this 
letter in a number of articles on the approaching economic crisis in Europe 
which he wrote for the New-York Daily Tribune in late September and the first 
half of October 1856 (see present edition, Vol. 15). These articles opened the 
long series of his contributions on the 1857 world crisis.—72 
This refers to Marx's private library which he had built up in the 1840s and left 
in Cologne in May 1849 in the care of his friend Roland Daniels, a member of the 
Communist League, when Marx was expelled by the Prussian authorities. Shortly 
before his arrest in 1851, Daniels hid the books in the storehouse of his brother, a

wine merchant. Acquitted at the Cologne Communist trial at the end of 1852, 
Roland Daniels came out of prison a sick man and died of tuberculosis in August 
1855.  In early 1856 his widow undertook to send the books to Marx but, owing to 
the high carriage costs and other difficulties, Marx did not receive his library until 
December 1860 after some books had got lost.—72 
92 The beginning of this letter has been torn off, the manuscript is damaged in a 
number of places (indicated by three dots in square brackets). Written in an 
unknown hand in the upper left corner is the date '27/28 Sept. 1856'. Being a 
reply to Marx's letters of 22 September and 26 September, the letter could not 
have been written before 27 September 1856.—72 
93 An allusion to Ewerbeck's inordinate literary vanity, on which Engels also 
commented in a letter to Marx of 15 October 1851 in connection with the 
publication of Ewerbeck's book L'Allemagne et les Allemands, Paris, 1851 (cf. 
present edition, Vol. 38, p. 478). 
The Père-Lachaise is a cemetery in Paris where many famous writers and 
artists are buried.— 73 
94 Engels means the regular reviews of the Crimean war which he wrote for the 
New-York Daily Tribune in 1855 and 1856 (see present edition, Vols. 12-14). 
Since Engels was not an official correspondent of the Tribune, the reviews were 
sent to New York by Marx. Most of them were published as leaders. Engels 
made no copies of the manuscripts he sent to Marx, while issues of the Tribune 
carrying his articles could not always be obtained in Manchester.—73 
95 In the period immediately preceding the 1848 revolution in France the 
Constitutionnel newspaper announced almost daily: 'L'horizon politique s'obscur­
cit' ('The political horizon is darkening'). Marx cited this cliché in his article 
'Bonaparte's Present Position', published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 
1 April 1858 (see present edition, Vol.  15).—73,  290

97 An allusion to Mieroslawski's theory that the Poles had a special mission of 
liberation and were called upon to serve as an instrument of universal social 
change (Marx plays on Archimedes' famous words: 'Give me a fulcrum and I 
will move the earth').—75 
98 Marx means the republication in the London Free Press of the part of the 
Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century which had earlier been 
published with abridgments and numerous misprints in The Sheffield Free Press, 
and in the same form in The Free Press (see Note 61).—75 
99 This refers to the continued publication of Marx's Revelations of the Diplomatic 
History of the 18th Century in The Free Press (see Note 61). From 16 August 1856 
the paper was increased from four pages to eight. Marx and Engels called the 
enlarged edition the new Free Press (see, e.g., Engels' letter to Marx of 31 
March 1857, this volume, p. 117).—76, 117

102 In November 1847 Switzerland was plunged into a civil war unleashed by the 
Sonderbund, a separatist union of seven economically backward Catholic cantons 
which resisted progressive bourgeois reforms. The Guizot government of 
France, supported by the governments of Austria and Russia, came out in 
support of the Sonderbund and the Catholic Church. However, Lord 
Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, seeking to weaken France, prevented 
her direct intervention in Swiss affairs and thereby contributed to her further 
rapprochement with Russia. The rout of the Sonderbund army by the Federal 
forces on 23 November deprived the European powers of a pretext for further 
diplomatic moves in the Swiss conflict.—81 
103 In October 1856 France and Britain, fearing that the reign of reaction and 
terror in the Kingdom of Naples (the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) might set 
off a revolutionary explosion, demanded that Ferdinand II, the Neapolitan 
King, should pursue a more flexible policy. Ferdinand II, confident of Austria's 
backing, refused to comply, whereupon France and Britain put their naval 
squadrons in the Mediterranean on die alert. However, the planned expedition 
against Naples did not take place owing to differences caused by Napoleon Ill's 
intention to instal a prince of the Bonaparte dynasty on the Neapolitan throne. 
By the autumn of 1856, the struggle had intensified for the union of the 
Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia and for an end to their 
dependence on the Ottoman Empire. The British government, apprehensive of 
France's intention to instal a member of the Bonaparte dynasty as head of the 
united state, and fearing the growth of Russian influence in the principalities, 
actively supported Austria's and Turkey's opposition to the movement for 
unification (this is what Marx had in mind speaking about Palmerston's alliance 
with Austria on die Turkish issue). However, despite the diplomatic complica­
tions and the resistance of the reactionary aristocrats, the principalities merged 
in 1862 to form the single state of Romania.—81, 107, 243 
104 This refers to the Crystal Palace in London (see Note 89).—81 
105 -j/he symptoms of economic crisis, die rise in unemployment and in the cost of 
living, the shortage of housing and food, and the increased taxation led to more 
frequent manifestations of the workers' discontent in Paris and other French 
cities,  to which die government responded with mass arrests. Those arrested 
were accused of putting up posters in the streets threatening property owners, 
landlords, usurers and even Emperor Napoleon III. 
The article in the Moniteur mentioned by Engels (it appeared on 24 October 
1856) protested against attacks in English newspapers on the French 
government and some of Napoleon Ill's entourage. It had broad repercussions 
in die British press.—82 
106 Banks patterned on the French Crédit mobilier (see Note 45) were established 
widi die latter's participation in a number of Central European countries.—83 
107 Marx used the data contained in Engels' letter and in The Manchester Guardian of 
17 November 1856, also sent by Engels, in his article 'The Crisis in Europe' 
published in die New-York Daily Tribune on 6 December 1856 (see present edition, 
Vol. 15).—83 
108 Engels means die wars Britain waged almost incessandy as a member of various 
anti-French coalitions against revolutionary and Napoleonic France in die late 
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (from 1793, when the French 
Republic officially declared war on it, up to the final fall of Napoleon's empire 
in 1815). Spain, which originally fought against France and suffered a number

of defeats, concluded a separate peace with the French in 1795 and, under 
pressure from the French Directory, and later from Napoleon, twice sided with

10 In September 1856 there was a royalist uprising in Neuchâtel. Many of the 
insurgents were arrested by the Swiss authorities. The King of Prussia insisted 
on their release. In reply, Switzerland demanded that he should relinquish his 
tide to Neuchâtel. Under the pressure of France, on whose initiative a 
European conference on the issue was held in March 1857, Prussia was forced 
to renounce her claims. 
In the eighteenth century the principality of Neuchâtel and Valangin (in 
German: Neuenburg and Vallendis) was under Prussian rule. It was ceded to 
France in 1806, during the Napoleonic wars. In 1815, by a decision of the 
Vienna Congress, it was incorporated into the Swiss Confederation as its 21st 
canton, while remaining a vassal of Prussia. On 29 February 1848 a bourgeois 
revolution in Neuchâtel put an end to Prussian rule and a republic was 
proclaimed. Prussia, however, laid constant claims to Neuchâtel up to 1857, 
thus causing an acute conflict with the Swiss Republic.—86, 88, 89 
11 Marx presumably alludes to the fact that under the Final Act of the Congress 
of Vienna (1815) Prussia received what was known as Swedish Pomerania from 
Denmark. Denmark received in compensation the duchy of Lauenburg from 
Prussia.—86 
12 The Polish region of Silesia, part of the Austrian Empire from 1526, was seized 
by Prussia during die War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48) caused by the 
claims of several European powers, above all King Frederick II of Prussia, to 
the Habsburg domains, which, in default of a male heir at the death of 
Emperor Charles VI, went to his daughter, Maria Theresa.—86 
1S Pietism was a trend in the Lutheran Church that emerged in Germany in the 
seventeenth century. Distinguished by extreme mysticism, it rejected rites and 
attached special importance to personal religious experience.—86, 575 
14 Marx developed these ideas on Prussia's history in his article 'The Right Divine 
of the Hohenzollerns' (see present edition, Vol. 15).—87 
15 An allusion to the fact that in 1848 Valdenaire was a deputy to the Prussian 
National Assembly, in which the liberal majority favoured a constitution 'by 
agreement (Vereinbarung) with the Crown'. Marx and Engels ironically called 
the members of the Berlin Assembly 'agreers'.—87 
16 Marx means the Imperial Constitution adopted by the Frankfurt National 
Assembly on 28 March 1849, but rejected by most of the German governments 
and in the first place by the King of Prussia. In May 1849 uprisings in defence 
of the Constitution flared up in Saxony, Rhenish Prussia and the South 
German states of Baden and Palatinate. In the last two a united insurgent army 
was formed, in which Frederick Engels fought. The movement was led by 
petty-bourgeois democrats, whose vacillation and passive defence tactics 
doomed it to defeat. The movement was finally suppressed in July 1849. Engels 
described it in The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution and Revolution 
and Counter-Revolution in Germany (see present edition, Vols. 10 and 11).—90

i'7 On the eve of and during the Crimean war Bruno Bauer published the 
following pamphlets: Rußland und das Germanenthum, Charlottenburg, 1853; 
Rußland und das Germanenthum. Zweite Abtheilung. Die deutsche und die 
orientalische Frage, Charlottenburg, 1853; Deutschland und das Russenthum,

Rußland und England, Charlottenburg, 1854 (French edition: La Russie et 
l'Angleterre, Charlottenburg, 1854). These works, particularly the last two, were 
criticised in Marx's unfinished draft 'Pamphlets über die russische Kollision von 
B. Bauer', written in January 1857 (see present edition, Vol. 15).—90 
l18 This study by Bauer was first published in Berlin in 1874 under the tide Philo, 
Strauss und Renan und das Urchristenthum. —91 
u9 In the spring of 1856 floods occurred in the valleys of the Rhône and the 
Loire. Feigning concern for the victims, Napoleon III visited a number of the 
affected towns and villages in a boat and personally handed out money. He also 
directed a message to the Minister of Public Works recommending measures to 
prevent such calamities.—92 
120 "The Marx family lived in Dean Street, Soho, an overcrowded and unhealthy 
London district where poorer refugees lived, from December 1850 to the 
autumn of 1856.—94 
121 Marx means the concessions made by Switzerland to Prussia in the conflict over 
Neuchâtel (see Note 110). 
Initially, the Swiss government had flatly refused to comply with Prussia's 
demand for the release of the arrested royalists who had rebelled in Neuchâtel 
in September 1856, and declared it was prepared to resist the threatened 
Prussian invasion. However, under pressure from Napoleon III, who did not 
want a war near the French frontier, the Swiss government released those 
arrested on 16 January 1857. The King of Prussia replied by rescinding the 
mobilisation order. The conflict was settled through diplomatic channels.—94 
122 Marx presumably means the Swiss government's official report to the Federal 
Diet on the Prusso-Swiss conflict over Neuchâtel (see Note 110) published in 
the Neue Preussische Zeitung on 1 January 1857. It maintained, in particular, 
that contrary to the assurances of the French government, the King of Prussia 
had assumed no commitments vis-à-vis the Emperor of France concerning 
renunciation of his claims to Neuchâtel and Valangin.—94 
123 xhe Corps législatif was established, alongside the State Council and the Senate, 
under the Constitution of 14 February 1852, following the Bonapartist coup 
d'état of 1851. The members of the State Council and the Senate were appointed 
by the head of state, while the Corps législatif was an elected body, the elections 
being supervised by state officials and the police, so that a docile majority was 
always ensured. As its powers were confined to endorsing bills drawn up by the 
State Council, the Corps législatif was, in effect, a screen for Napoleon Ill's 
unlimited rule.—94, 109 
124 The Orleanists were supporters of the Orleans dynasty which held power in 
France during the July monarchy (1830-48). They upheld the interests of the 
financial aristocracy and the big industrial bourgeoisie.—95, 291, 552 
125 Marx means the second of Engels' articles entided 'Mountain Warfare in the 
Past and Present' (see present edition, Vol. 15). The New-York Daily Tribune 
did not publish it. A copy of the article, written in Marx's hand, has reached us.

Constance, and Basle, in the event of the Prusso-Swiss conflict over Neuchâtel

126 Tije  letter is undated. But since it is Engels' reply to a letter from Marx of 20 
January 1857 and was answered by Marx on 23 January, it was presumably 
written on 21 or 22 January.—96 
127 Marx alludes to the influence exerted on the New-York Daily Tribune editors by 
Count Gurowski, a Polish pan-Slavist journalist, of which he had been informed 
by Olmsted, an agent of Putnam's Monthly. Marx attributed to his influence the 
Tribune editors' rejection of some of his own and Engels' articles, and the delay 
in publishing others (see this volume, p. 81).—98 
128 The New-York Daily Tribune did not publish the article.—98 
129 This refers to the colonial war Britain was waging against Persia (Iran) in 1856-57. 
In October 1856 Persian troops seized the city of Herat, the centre of the 
principality of Herat, claimed by Persia and Afghanistan. Britain took advantage 
of this to declare war on Persia with a view to further expansion in the Middle 
East, directed against both Persia and Afghanistan. In November a British naval 
force captured several Persian strong points on the coast of the Persian  Gulf. 
However, growing popular discontent in India compelled the British to hasten the 
conclusion of a peace treaty in March 1857, under which Persia relinquished her 
claims to Herat (later annexed to Afghanistan), while Britain withdrew her forces 
from the area.—98, 107, 134 
130 Marx probably means the formation, in 1854, of the US Republican Party, 
which put forward a programme to limit Negro slavery in the Southern states, 
and the considerable success it scored in the 1856 Presidential election, its 
candidate getting over 300,000 votes, one-third of the total. Howard Greeley, 
the publisher of the New-York Daily Tribune, was one of the party's leaders.—98 
131 A reference to the article 'Saint-Arnaud', which Engels wrote on the basis of 
C. L. Bazancourt's book L'expédition de Crimée (see Note 60).—100 
132 Marx means the supporters of the currency principle, one of the schools of the 
quantity theory of money widely subscribed to in Britain in the first half of the 
nineteenth century. According to this theory, the value and pi ice of 
commodities are determined by the quantity of money in circulation, and 
economic crises are caused mainly by violations of the laws of money 
circulation. The proponents of the quantity theory sought to maiiu un the 
stability of money circulation by means of obligatory gold backing ol bank 
notes.  The theory provided the economic justification for Peel's Bank Acts 
(introduced in England in 1844, and in Scotland in 1845). Under the 1844 Act, 
the Bank of England was divided into a Banking Department and an Issue 
Department and fixed proportions were laid down between t 1,•• amount of 
bank notes issued and the bullion required to back them. How , the actual 
demand for currency forced the government to suspend the Act in 1847 and 
1857 and to issue paper money in excess of the fixed limit. 
Marx showed the untenability of the currency principle in A Contribution to 
the Critique of Political Economy (present edition, Vol. 30). He discussed the 
1844 Bank Act in a number of articles (present edition, Vols. 12, 15 and 
16).—102, 126, 135, 202, 208, 215

in Detmold and brother of Georg Weerth, who died in Havana in July 1856, 
has reached us. Engels' letter was written in reply to Freiligrath's request of 11 
February for enquiries to be made about Georg Weerth's papers, including his 
diaries, which his relatives wanted to publish in Germany. In a letter to Engels 
on 16 February Marx also mentioned Freiligrath's request (see this volume, 
pp. 100-01). On receipt of Engels' reply, Freiligrath, as he said in his letter to 
Karl Weerth, at once wrote to Detmold. It may therefore be assumed that 
Engels' letter was posted shortly before, probably about 25 February.—103 
34 Engels means the vote of no confidence in Palmerston's government after a 
debate on the Anglo-Chinese conflict in the House of Commons lasting from 
26 February to 3 March 1857. The conflict has been provoked by the 
bombardment of Canton in October 1856 in retaliation for the Chinese 
authorities' arrest of a contraband vessel sailing under the British flag. The 
bombardment was the prelude to another colonial war by Britain—later in 
alliance with France—against China, the Second Opium War (1856-60). After 
the vote Palmerston dissolved Parliament, and in the new election his 
candidates, who supported the aggression against China, beat the Opposition 
even in their stronghold, Manchester, securing a majority for Palmerston in the 
House of Commons. Marx dealt with these events in several articles published 
in the New-York Daily Tribune in March and April 1857 (see present edition, 
Vol. 15). 
The Free Traders advocated non-interference of the state in the economy. 
Their stronghold was Manchester (hence the Manchester School and the 
Manchester Party). In the 1840s and 1850s the Free Traders were an 
independent political group which later formed the Left wing of the Liberal 
Party. 
The Peelites were moderate Tories advocating concessions to the commercial 
and industrial bourgeoisie. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 by their 
leader, Robert Peel, caused a split in the Tory party, with the Peelites forming 
an independent group that allied itself with the Whigs. In the late 1850s they 
joined the Liberal Party.—104, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115

136 The facts connected with the election campaign in Manchester and some data 
concerning Robert Lowe, John Potter and other candidates for Parliament 
related by Engels in this letter and those of 11, 20 and 31 March were used by 
Marx in his article 'The Defeat of Cobden, Bright and Gibson' (present edition, 
Vol. 15).—104, 110, 117 
137 The fraudulent machinations of the Docks Napoleon joint-stock company and 
the breach by Napoleon Ill's government of its promise to keep young Arthur 
Berryer, who was implicated in the machinations, out of trouble if his father, 
the well-known lawyer Pierre Antoine Berryer, refrained from denunciations 
embarrassing to the ruling quarters, were later discussed by Marx in his article 
'Portents of the Day' (present edition, Vol. 15).—105 
138 The Société du dix Décembre (Society of December 10) was a secret Bonapartist 
society consisting mainly of déclassé elements and political adventurists. Set up 
in 1849, it owed its name to the election of Louis Napoleon to the Presidency 
of the French Republic on 10 December 1848. Marx gives a detailed 
description of the Society in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see 
present edition, Vol. 11, pp.  149-51,  180-82, 186, 193-96).—107, 157, 436

140 From 1806 to 1808 the King of Naples was Joseph Bonaparte, elder brother of 
Napoleon I, and from 1808 to 1815 Joachim Murat, one of Napoleon's 
marshals.—107 
141 "Truly British Minister"—an allusion to Lord Russell's description of Palmerston 
as a champion of British interests in his House of Commons speech of 20 June 
1850,  in which he sought to justify Palmerston's military and diplomatic moves 
against Greece in connection with the burning in Athens in 1847 of the house of 
the merchant Pacifico, a Portuguese Jew and British subject. Lord Russell argued 
that Palmerston was motivated by the need to uphold the prestige of British 
citizens. The actual aim of Palmerston's moves was to make Greece surrender 
several strategic islands in the Aegean.—107, 116, 276, 431 
142 Marx means the policy of Britain's ruling quarters towards Persia, Afghanistan, 
China and other Asian countries during Palmerston's first term as Foreign 
Secretary (1830-41). Thus the British government declared the siege of Herat 
in November 1837 by Persian troops an act of hostility towards Britain and 
took advantage of it to send a naval squadron to the Persian  Gulf.  The Shah of 
Persia was forced to lift the siege in August 1838 and later to conclude a trade 
agreement with Britain advantageous to the latter. 
Palmerston was also Foreign Secretary when Britain unleashed what came 
to be known as the First Opium War (1840-42), which marked the first stage in 
turning China into a semi-colony of West European capitalist states.—107 
143 -pne  Aberdeen coalition ministry (1852-55) consisted mainly of Peelites 
(break-away. group of Tories) and Whigs. Junior posts were held by Radicals 
and leaders of the Irish faction in the House of Commons. Marx and Engels 
described the bankruptcy of this government of 'All the Talents' in the article 
'The Late British Government' (present edition, Vol. 13, pp. 620-26).—108 
144 Marx means the massacre by government troops of participants in a mass 
meeting for electoral reform in St. Peter's Field near Manchester on 16 August 
1819.  By analogy with the battle of Waterloo it was called Peterloo. 
The 6 gagging acts—the six exceptional laws passed by the British Parliament 
in 1819 after the massacre in St. Peter's Field. Introduced by the Tory ministry, 
of which Palmerston was a member, they virtually abolished habeas corpus and 
freedom of the press and of assembly.—108 
145 An allusion to the power struggle in France that preceded the Bonapartist coup 
d'état of 2 December 1851. Louis Bonaparte, President of the Second Republic, 
was in conflict with the party of Order, the bloc of the two monarchist 
factions—the Legitimists, supporters of the Bourbons overthrown in 1830, and 
the Orleanists (see Note 124), who supported the junior (Orleans) branch of the 
Bourbon dynasty. The party of Order was the strongest force in the French 
Legislative Assembly which was disbanded by Bonaparte's supporters on 
2 December 1851.—108 
146 Engels ironically compares the Polish émigrés in the Turkish service who 
fought on the side of the North Caucasian mountaineers against Russia to the 
300 Spartans who, headed by King Leonidas, defended the Pass of 
Thermopylae against the army of the Persian King Xerxes I in 480 B.C.—109 
147 Engels means Tucker's Political Fly-Sheets, a series of 12 issues published by the 
Urquhartite Tucker in London in 1853 and 1854 and republished in 1855.

Issues 1 and 2 contained the pamphlets 'Palmerston and Russia' and 
'Palmerston and the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessy', reproducing the content of 
articles 3, 4 and 5 of Marx's 8-article series on Palmerston published in The 
People's Paper in 1853 (see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 341-406). The other 
issues carried mostly articles by David Urquhart also attacking Palmerston's 
foreign policy.—110, 111, 115 
This refers to those articles of Marx's series Lord Palmerston which appeared in the 
New-York Daily Tribune. In contrast to The  People's  Paper,  which published all eight 
articles and as a consecutive whole (see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 341-406), the 
Tribune carried only six articles, in the form of four separate leaders under 
different titles: 'Palmerston', corresponding to articles 1 and 2 in The People's 
Paper  (NYDT,  19 October 1853), 'Palmerston and Russia', corresponding to 
article 3  (NYDT,  4 November 1853), 'A Chapter of Modern History', 
corresponding to articles 4 and 5  (NYDT,  21 November 1853), and 'England and 
Russia', corresponding to article 7  (NYDT,  11 January 1854).—  111,

Marx means the seizure by British naval forces of the Iranian port of Bushire 
in the Persian Gulf during the 1856-57 Anglo-Persian war (see Note 129).— 111 
The Anti-Corn Law League was founded in 1838 by the Manchester 
manufacturers and Free Trade leaders Richard Cobden and John Bright. It 
advocated the abolition of the high import duties on agricultural produce 
imposed—in the interests of the landed aristocracy—by a series of Corn Laws 
to maintain high prices for that produce on the home market. The struggle 
between the industrial bourgeoisie and the landowners over the Corn Laws 
ended in their repeal (June 1846), after which the League announced its 
dissolution. Some of its branches, however, continued in existence for several 
years.—113,  116, 215, 305 
Marx means the June 1848 uprising of Paris workers, whose defeat largely 
predetermined the failure of the 1848-49 revolution and the 
subsequent period of political reaction in Europe in the 1850s.—113 
In his letter of 5 March 1857 Charles Dana wrote that of all of Marx's articles 
only the second instalment of the article on mountain warfare had not been 
published, and this because interest in the Swiss question had subsided. The 
two articles on Persia, he wrote, had been merged into one and published, 
while the second article on Austria's trade had been set and would be published 
as soon as space permitted. However, it was not until 4 August 1857 that this 
article entitled, like the first, 'The Maritime Commerce of Austria' actually 
appeared in print.—114 
'Geniality leaves off where money matters begin'—this remark was addressed to 
the King of Prussia by David Hansemann, a leader of the liberal Rhenish 
bourgeoisie, on 8 June 1847 at a sitting of the First United Diet, from which 
the government was vainly trying to obtain endorsement of a fresh loan.—114 
In a speech in the House of Commons on 23 February 1848 Anstey presented 
the facts relating to the publication in 1835, in Urquhart's series The Portfolio, 
of secret documents from the archives of the Grand Duke Constantine, Viceroy 
of Poland. The documents had been seized by Polish insurgents in 1830 and 
were later handed over by Polish refugees to Palmerston. It was only at the 
insistence of King William IV that Palmerston made them available for 
publication (for details see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 386-87).—115

155 The  Peace Party  or the  Peace Society (Society  for Promoting Permanent  and  Universal 
Peace) was an organisation founded by the Quakers in London in 
1816.  It was strongly supported by the Free Traders, who held that, given 
peace, free trade would enable Britain to make full use of her industrial 
superiority and thus gain economic and political supremacy.—115

160 xne bombardment of Odessa by an Anglo-French squadron took place on 22 
April 1854, soon after Britain and France joined Turkey in the war against 
Russia (the Crimean war, 1853-56). It was essentially a military demonstra­
tion.—119 
161 Marx refers to the Vienna Conference of 1855, which was to work out the 
terms for peace between the participants in the Crimean war (1853-56). It was 
attended by representatives of Russia, Britain, France, Austria and Turkey and 
lasted, with intervals, from 15 March to 4 June 1855. The conference was 
preceded by several rounds of talks between the Ambassadors held in 1853 and 
1854 on the initiative of Austrian Foreign Minister Buol, who sought to 
mediate between the belligerents. The conference produced no results. 
Britain was represented by its Special Envoy Lord John Russell.—119 
162 The facts mentioned in this paragraph were dealt with in greater detail by 
Marx in his article 'Result of the Election', published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune on 22 April 1857.—119 
163 Marx probably means one of the articles on Pan-Slavism written by Engels for 
the New-York Daily Tribune but not published (see Note 11).—120 
164 Engels wrote this letter in reply to Jenny Marx's of 12 April (see this volume, 
p. 563). The manuscript is not dated. However, the article 'Changes in the 
Russian Army', which was enclosed in the letter and was published in the New 
York Daily Tribune on 6 May 1857, was presumably sent to New York from 
London not later than Friday, 17 April, so the letter was probably written on 
about 16 April.—121 
165 A reference to Dana's letter to Marx of 6 April 1857 inviting him to contribute 
to The New American Cyclopaedia, 'a popular dictionary of general knowledge' 
prepared by a group of progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers on the 
New-York Daily Tribune editorial staff and edited by Charles Dana and George 
Ripley. It was published in 16 volumes by D. Appleton and Company, New 
York, in 1858-63 and reprinted in 1868-69. A number of prominent US and 
European scholars wrote for it. On Engels' advice Marx agreed to contribute a 
number of articles. But Engels wrote most of them himself so that Marx could 
complete his economic research. Marx wrote mainly biographical essays on 
military and political figures with help from Engels in dealing with the military

aspect. Marx and Engels wrote their articles from revolutionary-proletarian, 
materialist positions notwithstanding the condition laid down by the editors that 
they should not express their party point of view. Because of this condition 
Marx limited the range of his subjects mainly to military matters and to studies 
on different countries, renouncing his initial intention of writing essays on the 
history of German philosophy, the Napoleonic Code, Chartism, socialism and 
communism. He held that these subjects could not be dealt with in a spirit of 
even apparent neutrality. It may have been for this reason also that Marx did 
not contribute the article 'Aesthetics', as originally planned. 
The articles in The New American Cyclopaedia were published anonymously, 
and only volumes II, V and XVI contained lists of the authors of major 
articles. Marx was mentioned as the author of the articles 'Army', 'Artillery', 
'Bernadotte', 'Bolivar', 'Cavalry', 'Fortification', 'Infantry', and 'Navy' (actually 
these articles, except for 'Bernadotte' and 'Bolivar', were written by Engels). 
Marx's and Engels' authorship of other articles has been established on the 
basis of the Marx-Engels correspondence, Charles Dana's letters to Marx, 
Marx's notebooks, which recorded the despatch of articles to New York, and of 
other archive material (conspectuses, extracts for articles, etc.). In all, the 
authorship of 81 articles has been established. 
Marx and Engels contributed to The New American Cyclopaedia from July 
1857 to November 1860, their articles (those we know of) appearing in volumes 
I-V, VII, IX and XII. They were also included, unchanged, in the 1868-69 
edition of the Cyclopaedia but were not reprinted any more during the authors' 
lifetime. They were collected and published in 1933 in the Soviet Union in 
Marx and Engels, Works, First Russian Edition, Vol. XI, Part II. The most 
complete publications of these articles are to be found in Volumes 14 (1959) 
and 44 (1977) of the Second Russian Edition of the Works of Marx and Engels 
and in Vol. 18 of the present edition (1982). However, these publications did 
not include the articles 'Austerlitz', 'Augereau' and 'Badajos', of which Engels 
was erroneously regarded as the author. When preparing the Russian edition, 
the editors established the true authors of a number of articles wrongly 
attributed to Marx and Engels by some bibliographers. Thus the articles 
'Abd-el-Kader' and 'Chartism' were written by William Humphrey, 'Austerlitz' 
by Henry W. Herbert, 'Epicurus' by Hermann Raster, 'Socialism' by Parke 
Godwin, and 'Hegel' by Henry Smith. The article 'Aesthetics' cannot be by 
Marx either, for it conflicts with the views on the subject expressed in his 
works.—122, 134 
The letter is not dated. Since it was in reply to Marx's letter of 21 April 1857 
and Marx answered it on 23 April, Engels must have written it between these 
dates.—122 
On 26 February 1857, speaking in the House of Commons about the British 
government's unlawful actions in the Anglo-Chinese conflict, Cobden tabled a 
resolution condemning Britain's military operations in China. After a long 
debate the motion was adopted, resulting in a vote of no confidence in 
Palmerston's government (see Note 134).—127 
While working on Die Philosophie Herakleitos des Dunklen von Ephesos, Lassalle 
was also writing a historical drama, Franz von Sickingen. In a letter to Marx on 
26 April 1857 he said that it would in a sense 'set things alight'.—129 
Engels arrived in London early in June 1857 and returned to Manchester at 
the end of the month.—131, 136, 141, 154

171 'Social philosophy' ('Sozialphilosophie') was the term Moses Hess used in his works 
of the 1840s to denote the teachings of the French Utopian socialists 
(Saint-Simon, Fourier and others) and the petty-bourgeois social doctrines of 
Proudhon.—133 
172 Most of these articles were soon written and publishpd in The New American 
Cyclopaedia (in the present edition they are in Vol. (18). In addition, Engels 
undertook to write other 'A' articles ('Alma', 'Ammunition', 'Airey' and 
'Army'—all ordered by Dana in his letter to Marx of 8 May 1857). Some 
articles mentioned in» the list ('Axle', 'Approaches', 'Advanced Guard') were not 
published in the Cyclopaedia and probably not written by Engels. The articles 
'Abukir', 'Anglesey' and 'Augereau' were in all probability written by other 
authors.—137 
173 On coming to London in early June 1857, Engels had a relapse of the ailment 
about which he wrote to Marx on 20 May (this volume, pp. 130-31). He 
probably stayed with his brother-in-law Emil Blank, husband of his sister Marie. 
Engels gives only 'Friday morning' as the date of this letter. In earlier 
editions it was dated 12 June 1857. But since it was written in early June and 
not later than 10 June (as can be seen from the fact that Marx wrote the draft 
of his letter to Collet on the back of this letter not later than 10 June—see 
Note 174), and moreover on a Friday, the letter can only have been written on 
5 June.—137 
174 The extant draft of the letter (on the back of Engels' letter to Marx of 5 June 
1857) is not dated. However, since Collet replied to Marx on 10 June 1857, it 
may be assumed that the letter was written about 10 June.—138 
175 The draft letter is not dated. It was written in reply to Collet's letter to Marx of 
10 June, presumably immediately after it was received.—138 
176 This letter is written on Dana's letter to Marx of 11 June 1857, which Marx 
mentions in the first lines. Dana wrote telling Marx that he was returning the 
manuscript of the article 'Saint-Arnaud' (see Note 60) rejected by Putnam's 
Monthly; Dana did not advise him to write the article 'Ships against Walls' 
because the editors refused to guarantee its publication. He also wrote that he 
hoped to be receiving articles for The New American Cyclopaedia soon.—140 
177 Marx means the list of articles for The New American Cyclopaedia which he sent 
to Dana following the one drawn up by Engels on 28 May 1857 (see this 
volume, pp. 136-37). This list is not extant.—142 
178 Marx refers to the Indian uprising of 1857-59 against British rule. It flared up 
in May 1857 among the Sepoy units of the Bengal army and spread to large 
areas of Northern and Central India. (Sepoys were mercenary soldiers 
recruited from among the Indians and serving under British officers.) Its main 
strength was provided by the peasants and the poor artisans. Directed by local 
feudal lords, the uprising was put down owing to the country's disunity, 
religious and caste differences, and the military and technical superiority of the 
colonialists.—142, 146, 413, 566

supporters of revolutionary action, attempted to start an uprising in Italy with a

by Pizacono seized a ship bound for Tunis from Genoa and landed in the 
Kingdom of Naples. Attempts were also made to start uprisings in Leghorn 
and Genoa but, like the expedition to the South, they also failed. Pizacono and 
many of his associates perished in clashes with Neapolitan troops. Mazzini 
managed to avoid arrest and return to London.—142 
180 xhis refers to excerpts which Marx made from the various sources on the 
military history of antiquity for Engels, who was working on the article 'Army' 
for The New American Cyclopaedia. The notes from the encyclopaedias of 
Ersch-Gruber and Pauly mentioned below in the text are extant. Marx also 
made excerpts, probably later, from Wilkinson's three-volume Manners and 
Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, London, 1837.—147, 565 
181 A reference to the second batch of 'A' articles which Engels wrote for The New 
American Cyclopaedia in accordance with his list (see this volume, pp. 136-37). 
Judging by an entry in Marx's notebook made on 24 July 1857, Marx sent 
these articles to New York with the first batch of 'A' articles received from 
Engels on 14 July (see this volume, p. 146).—148, 159 
i82 The Loan Societies—a variety of the Friendly Societies in England (see 
Note 76)—granted workers low-interest loans repayable in instalments. Their 
funds,  like those of the Friendly Societies, consisted of membership dues. Loans 
could be made to non-members, provided they had two reliable guarantors.—

183 From 27 July to 8 November 1857 Engels underwent medical treatment at the 
seaside: at Waterloo near Liverpool (until the end of August, when he returned 
to Manchester for a fortnight in view of his father's arrival there), at Ryde on 
the Isle of Wight (from the 8th to the end of September), and in Jersey (until 8 
November), whence he returned to Manchester.—149, 154, 160, 195 
i84 An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in K. Marx and 
F. Engels, The First Indian War of Independence 1857-1859, Foreign Languages 
Publishing House, Moscow [1959].—151, 233 
185 The letter Engels sent to Jenny Marx from Waterloo, presumably about 11 
August 1857, has not been found. It was written in reply to Marx's letter to 
Engels of 9 August.—151 
186 Marx based his assumption of the possible retreat of the British troops from 
Delhi on the numerical superiority of the insurgents, who had captured this 
important fortress in the middle of May 1857, soon after the beginning of the 
Indian uprising (see Note 178). But the insurgents, who adhered to the tactics 
of passive defence and were demoralised by the treacherous behaviour of the 
local feudal lords, failed to take advantage of their superiority. This enabled 
the British to hold out until they received reinforcements. In mid-September they 
took Delhi.—152 
187 The  reference  is presumably  to articles  for The New  American Cyclopaedia  or to 
material  for  articles which Marx intended  to write  for it  with Engels' help on 
military questions.—153 
i88 Conrad Schramm, a member of the Communist League and a close friend of 
Marx and Engels, was ill with tuberculosis. In 1852 he went to the USA hoping 
to earn a living and improve his health. In the summer of 1857 he returned to 
London and, his condition having worsened, he was immediately placed in a 
hospital for German refugees. On 20 September he moved to Jersey where

Engels too soon came for treatment. Schramm died on 15 January 1858.—158, 
171, 312 
189 The letter, written presumably on 11 August 1857, when Marx despatched 
articles for The New American Cyclopaedia, has not been found.—159 
190 This letter was published in earlier editions without the notes on Bennigsen 
and Barclay which Engels made for Marx's biographical articles for The New 
American Cyclopaedia (see Note 165). The notes were first published— 
separately from the letter—in 1977, in Vol. 44 of the Second Russian Edition 
of the Works of Marx and Engels, under the editorial heading 'Bennigsen and 
Barclay'. In the present edition the letter is published in full with the notes for 
the first time.— 162 
191 Here and below Engels describes events during the war of the Fourth Coalition 
(Britain, Russia, Prussia and Sweden) against Napoleonic France. After the 
defeat of the Prussian army by Napoleon in the spring of 1806 the main 
theatre of war shifted to East Prussia, where Napoleon encountered stubborn 
resistance from the allied army of Russia and Prussia. 
The battle of Preussisch-Eylau on 7-8 February 1807 between the French 
army and Russian and Prussian forces was indecisive.—162, 170, 175 
192 The French laid siege to Danzig (Gdansk) in March 1807. The garrison, 
consisting of Prussian troops and a Russian detachment, offered stubborn 
resistance. The fortress surrendered to superior enemy forces at the end of 
May 1807.—162 
193 The battle of Smolensk, during the Patriotic War of Russia against Napoleon, 
took place on 16-18 August 1812. Units of the First and Second Russian armies 
(commanded by Barclay de Tolly and Bagration) which had joined up on 3 
August rebuffed the attacks of Napoleon's troops to cover the withdrawal of 
the main forces. At the cost of heavy losses Napoleon captured the city, which 
was abandoned by the Russian rearguard after the main forces had 
withdrawn.—163 
194 This passage reflects the tendentious presentation of the events of the Patriotic 
War of Russia, 1812, in Jomini's Vie politique et militaire de Napoléon (Vols. 1-4, 
Paris,  1827) and other books (e.g. Bernhardi's Denkwürdigkeiten aus dem Leben ... 
des Grafen von Toll, Vols. 1-4, Leipzig, 1856), which Engels used as sources. In 
particular, they contain inaccuracies in explaining why Mikhail Kutuzov, newly 
appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army, abandoned the position at 
Gzhatsk (more precisely at Tsarevo-Zaimishche), which it had occupied since 29 
August 1812, and withdrew to Borodino. Kutuzov did so because he intended 
to give decisive batde with a more favourable balance of forces, for which it was 
necessary to win time and bring up reinforcements. The battle of Borodino was 
fought on 7 September. It brought about a turn in the war in Russia's favour, 
despite the forced but expedient abandonment of Moscow.—164 
195 In the final version of their article 'Barclay de Tolly' Marx and Engels gave a 
more accurate description of Barclay's role. There the remark concerning the 
predominance of administrative and diplomatic functions in Barclay's activities 
during the war of the Sixth Coalition (Russia, Austria, Prussia, Britain, Spain, 
Sweden and other countries) against Napoleonic France, applied only to the 
1814 campaign, and Barclay's role as military commander in a number of 
battles during the 1813 campaign is noted.—164

604 Notes 
196 Published here are three short texts by Engels, probably fragments of a letter 
to Marx of 11 or 12 September 1857 which has not been preserved in full. Like 
other letters written at the time, they reflect Engels' help to Marx in writing 
biographical articles for The New American Cyclopaedia. 
The first and third fragments (written on separate sheets) were published in 
the Second Russian Edition of the Works of Marx and Engels as the letter in 
question. The second fragment (written on two sheets) has never been published 
before. The approximate date of writing has been established on the basis of the 
previous letter of Engels to Marx, written on 10 September, and Marx's replies 
written on 15 and 17 September 1857. 
The order in which the fragments are presented in this volume is the order 
in which they are assumed to have been written.—164 
197 At the battle of Grossbeeren on 23 August and of Dennewitz on 6 September 
1813,  the Prussian corps under Bülow defeated the French. Both battles took 
place during the war of the Sixth Coalition (Russia, Austria, Prussia, Britain, 
Spain, Sweden and other countries) against Napoleonic France. In the 1813 
campaign Bernadotte commanded the allied Northern Army, which included 
Bülow's corps.—164, 274 
198 At the battle of Leipzig (16-19 October 1813) die allied armies of Russia, 
Austria, Prussia and Sweden defeated Napoleon and his allies. This 'battle of 
the nations' led to Germany's liberation from Napoleon's rule.—165, 179 
199 The Directory (consisting of five directors of whom one was re-elected every 
year) was the leading executive body in France set up under the 1795 
Constitution. It governed France until Bonaparte's coup d'état of 1799 and 
expressed the interests of the big bourgeoisie.—165 
200 Engels refers to the military operations in Transylvania (then part of Hungary) 
of a revolutionary army against the Austrian forces, Romanian detachments, 
provoked into action against Hungary by the Austrian authorities, and a 
Russian detachment sent by the Tsarist government to help the Habsburg 
Empire. Started under Bern's command in December 1848, during the 1848-49 
revolution in Hungary, this campaign ended a few months later in the 
practically complete liberation of Transylvania from the counter-revolutionary 
forces. However, in the second Transylvanian campaign (mentioned below) 
called forth by a new concentration of counter-revolutionaries in the summer 
of 1849 and the arrival of fresh contingents of Tsarist troops, Bern's entire 
army was routed at the end of July 1849 and he himself had to flee to 
Turkey.—167 
201 Bern's march into the Banat (a region in the Serbian Voivodina, then part of 
Hungary) was undertaken in the spring of 1849 to put down the Serbian 
movement for autonomy incited by the Austrian audiorities and influenced by 
the Serbian big bourgeoisie, nobility and clergy. As in Transylvania, the 
struggle in die Banat with its population of Hungarians, Germans and 
Romanians as well as Serbs, was complicated by clashes between Serbians and 
non-Serbians, and the erroneous stand adopted by the Hungarian bourgeois 
and aristocratic revolutionaries on the national question. Only on 28 July 
1849,  shortly before the fall of the Hungarian Republic, did they officially 
agree to recognise the equality of all nationalities inhabiting Hungary.—167

despatch to New York that day. As is seen from Marx's notebook, they were 
sent off to Charles Dana on 22 September 1857.—168 
203 Here and below Marx writes about Bern's participation in the Polish national 
liberation uprising of November 1830-October 1831. The majority of its 
participants were revolutionary gentry (srdachta) and its leaders came mostly 
from the aristocracy. It was suppressed by the Russian army with the support 
of Prussia and Austria. 
At the battle of Iganin on 10 May 1831 the Polish insurgents were 
victorious in a clash with Russian troops. 
At the battle of Ostrolenka on 26 May 1831 the Polish insurgents were 
defeated by Russian forces under Dibich. The final blow was delivered when 
the Russians captured Warsaw (see below) after storming its suburb Vola on 
6 September. The remnants of the insurgent army fled to Prussia and 
Austria.—169, 172 
204 The battle of Austerliti (see Note 46) was an important event in die war of the 
Third Coalition (Austria, Russia, Britain and Sweden) against Napoleonic 
France (1805).—170, 174 
205 On the battle of Jena on 14 October 1806 see Note 46. The same 
day Marshal Davout's army defeated the main Prussian forces at Auerstädl The 
defeat of Prussia in these two battles led to the quick occupation of the 
Kingdom of Prussia by die French and to the retreat of the remnants of the 
Prussian army to the eastern frontier. 
These battles occurred during the war of the Fourth Coalition against 
Napoleonic France (see Note 191).-—1^4, 178 
206 At the battle of Wagram (Austria) on 5-6 July 1809 during the war of the Fifth 
Coalition (Austria, Britain), Napoleon's army defeated the Austrians.—170, 
175, 176 
207 An entry in Marx's notebook shows that he sent Engels' articles 'Algeria' and 
'Ammunition' to New York on 18 September 1857.—173 
208 A reference to the Treaty of the Tafna of 30 May 1837 between Bugeaud and 
Abd-el-Kader, the leader of the Algerian liberation war which lasted, with short 
intervals, from 1832 to 1847. The French had resumed operations against 
Abd-el-Kader in 1835 in violation of the peace treaty concluded a year earlier. 
Under the treaty of the Tafna France again recognised the independence of 
Abd-el-Kader's state in Western Algeria, except for a few coastal towns. In 
1839 the peace was again violated by the French, and the Algerian liberation 
struggle was resumed. When working on the article 'Bugeaud', Marx took into 
account Engels' opinion of this general. In particular, enlarging upon Engels' 
remark about Bugeaud's venality, Marx wrote: 'A secret article, not reduced to 
writing, stipulated that 30,000 boojoos (about $12,000) should be paid to Gen. 
Bugeaud' (present edition, Vol. 18, p. 212).—177 
209 The battle of the Alma took place on 20 September 1854 between the Russian 
forces and the numerically superior allied forces of the French, British and 
Turks.  It was the first batde after the Allies' landing in the Crimea (at 
Eupatoria) on 14 September. The defeat and withdrawal of the Russian forces 
left the road to Sevastopol open for the Allies. 
The battle of Balaklava (mentioned below in the text) between die Russian 
and the allied Anglo-French and Turkish forces took place on 25 October 
1854.  Units of the Russian army tried to cut off the English and Turkish troops

taking part in the siege of Sevastopol from their base in Balaklava. They 
succeeded in inflicting serious losses on the enemy, especially on the English 
cavalry, but failed to achieve their main objective.—177, 297 
21° A reference to the siege of Sevastopol by the French and British troops during 
the Crimean War (1853-56) which lasted from September 1854 to August 1855 
(349 days).—178 
211 This campaign took place during the war of the European coalition (Austria, 
Prussia, Britain, the Netherlands, Spain, Piedmont, Naples and other monar­
chies) (1792-97) against the French Republic. Prussia, a member of the coalition 
from 1792, concluded a separate peace with France in Basle in 1795.—178 
212 The Tugendbund (Union of Virtue)—one of the patriotic societies founded in 
Prussia after its defeat by Napoleonic France in 1806-07. It united representa­
tives of the liberal nobility and the bourgeois intelligentsia and aimed at 
spreading the idea of an anti-Napoleonic liberation war and supporting 
moderate liberal reforms in Prussia. The Tugendbund was banned on 
Napoleon's demand on 31 December 1809 by Frederick William III, who also 
feared its activities. However, it continued to exist secretly until the end of the 
Napoleonic wars.—178 
213 An allusion to the 1848-49 revolutionary movement in Baden. The German 
petty-bourgeois democrat and journalist Blind took part in it, while the 
German republican Hecker was a military leader in the Baden uprising in April 
1848.—179 
2,4 The battle of the Katzbach (Silesia) was fought on 26 August 1813 during the war 
of the Sixth Coalition (Russia, Prussia, Austria, Britain, Sweden, Spain and 
Portugal) against Napoleonic France. The Silesian army, commanded by 
Blücher and consisting of a Prussian corps under York and two Russian corps 
under Langeron and Sacken, defeated the French army of Marshal Mac-
donald.—179 
215 At the battle of Dresden on 26-27 August 1813 Napoleon's army routed the 
allied forces of Austria, Prussia and Russia (the Bohemian or chief army), 
commanded by the Austrian Field Marshal Schwarzenberg.—179 
2)6 In a number of batUes in the Montmirail region (east of Paris) Napoleon 
defeated separate units of Blücher's Silesian army in mid-February 1814 by 
taking advantage of their isolation from one another.—180 
217 At the battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 the Anglo-Dutch and Prussian forces 
commanded by the Duke of Wellington and Blücher defeated Napoleon's 
army, thus deciding the allies' final victory over Napoleonic France. The 
outcome of the battle of Waterloo is credited to Blücher's army which was 
defeated by Napoleon at Ligny on 16 June but managed to escape French 
pursuit and join up with the Anglo-Dutch forces.—180, 357 
218 Marx's notebook contains an entry of 29 September 1857 about the despatch to 
New York of his article 'Bessières' and the articles 'Bern' and 'Bosquet' written 
joindy with Engels. —181 
219 As is seen from Marx's notebook, in September and October 1857 he wrote for 
the New-York Daily Tribune a series of five articles on the state of the Second 
Empire's finances and Napoleon Ill's financial policy. The articles were not 
printed. The manuscripts have not been found.—181, 297

221 The Mahratta principalities (the Mahrattas or Marathas inhabited a large 
territory in Western India) were formed on the territory of the Mahratta state, 
which arose in the latter half of the seventeenth century during the struggle 
against the Empire of the Great Moguls. Later, particularly in the 1730s and 
1740s, it underwent a process of feudal decentralisation. The confederation of 
the Mahratta principalities thus formed disintegrated in the second half of the 
eighteenth century. Weakened by the struggle with the Afghans and internal 
strife the principalities fell prey to the British East India Company which 
annexed a considerable part of their territories in the three Anglo-Mahratta 
wars (1775-82, 1803-05 and 1817-18) and made the remaining princes its 
vassals.—185 
222 Marx used the contents of Engels' letter for his two articles, 'The Revolt in 
India', written on 29 September and 6 October 1857 (see present edition, 
Vol. 15). The purely military evaluation of possible British operations intended by 
Engels for Marx's information was supplemented with the political assessment 
of the aims of the Indian national liberation movement and the efforts of the 
British colonialists to preserve their rule in India.—185 
223 As is seen from entries in Marx's notebook, on 29 September 1857 he sent to 
New York, besides 'Battery', three articles received from Engels: 'Bivouac', 
'Blindage' and 'Bonnet'; on 6 October, he despatched one more batch of 'B' 
articles: 'Bomb'; 'Bomb-Ketch', 'Bomb-Proof, 'Bomb Vessel', 'Bombardier' and 
'Bombardment'.—185

Brighton on 29-30 September, on his way to Jersey to complete his medical 
treatment (see Note 183). Available sources do not establish with certainty 
whether Engels and Marx met at the appointed time, but we know from Marx's 
own words (see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 85) that he and Engels visited their 
sick friend Conrad Schramm in Jersey, most probably at the beginning of 
October 1857.—187

229 Harney, the former leader of revolutionary Chartism, withdrew from the 
labour movement in die first half of the 1850s, when diere was a general 
decline in die English proletariat's political activity. In die autumn of 1855 he 
went to St. Helier, die capital of Jersey, to convey an address of solidarity from 
British radicals to Victor Hugo on die occasion of the British decision to expel 
him and other French emigrants from die island (see Note 16). Harney settled 
there and in mid-1856 became editor of The  Jersey  Independent, whicn he devoted 
almost entirely to local problems, criticising the local system from bourgeois-
radical positions.—188 
230 Hejira (or Hegira)—the flight of Mohammed and his followers from Mecca to 
Medina in 622, from which the Mohammedan era is dated.

234 Engels refers to die preliminary draft of die article 'Armada' for The New 
American Cyclopaedia which he wrote on the basis of excerpts made by Marx 
from various sources. Marx put die finishing touches to Engels' text. The 
material Engels sent for die Cyclopaedia presumably included also die article 
'Ayacucho', to which Marx added a final paragraph before sending it and die 
article 'Armada' to New York on 23 October 1857, as an entry in his notebook 
shows (for these articles see present edition, Vol. 18).—190 
235 This refers to die article 'Artillery', which Charles Dana asked Marx to write 
for The New American Cyclopaedia early in May 1857. Engels undertook to write 
die article but, busy widi 'Army' and smaller articles for die Cyclopaedia, he did 
not begin it till after 19 October. Marx and Engels did not expect diat die 
article could still be included in die current volume widi die 'A' articles and 
diought, as diis and the following letters show, diat it could be inserted in some

2S8 Further on Engels describes the siege and storming of the insurgent-held 
fortress of Delhi by British troops during the Indian uprising of 1857-59 (see 
Note 178). The city fell on 19-20 September 1857. Engels dealt with these 
events in his article 'The Capture of Delhi' published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune on 5 December 1857 (see present edition, Vol. 15).—197

240 Marx proposed to meet Engels who was returning from Jersey to Manchester 
via London after his long stay at the seaside (see Note 183). The two friends 
did not meet, probably because of the 'bad arrangements of the railway 
Company in Brighton', as Engels wrote to Marx on 15 November 1857 (see 
p. 200). Marx may also have confused the date of Engels' arrival in London: he 
was to be there on 9 November (Monday) and not on the 5th (Thursday). So 
Marx's remark 'a week ago on Thursday' seems to be a mistake. Besides, from 
the above-mentioned letter of Engels it transpires that it was on the Monday 
that their meeting was to take place.—199 
241 Marx seems to refer to his two articles ('The Revolt in India') published as 
leaders in the New-York Daily Tribune on 13 and 23 October 1857. When Marx 
wrote them, at the end of September and the beginning of October, he did not 
have sufficient information on the British siege of Delhi (which was finally 
captured on 20 September) and assumed that a successful storm of Delhi was 
hardly possible.—199 
242 Engels' information on the rapid increase in exports of English textile goods to 
India was used by Marx in his article 'The Financial Crisis in Europe', 
published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 22 December 1857 (see present 
edition, Vol. 15).—202 
243 The discovery of gold in California in 1848 and in Australia in 1851 helped to 
overcome the 1847 economic crisis and its aftermath. The temporary revival of 
industry and trade after the crisis was also due, to a certain extent, to European 
and American goods gaining access to the Chinese market as a result of the 
Anglo-Chinese war of 1840-42 (known as the first Opium War). In 1857, 
however, this access was hampered by a new military conflict of the European 
powers with China (see Note 134).—203

245 Ernest Jones proposed as early as April 1857 to hold such a conference and to 
invite bourgeois radicals. In calling for an alliance with the radicals in order to 
campaign jointly for electoral reform Jones hoped to revive the mass Chartist 
movement on this basis. However, he made serious political concessions to the 
radicals when working out a common platform for uniting with them. Of the 
six points of the People's Charter (universal suffrage, annual Parliaments, vote 
by secret ballot, equal constituencies, abolition of property qualifications for 
candidates to Parliament, and payment of M.P.s) he retained only the demand

for universal manhood suffrage. Jones' conciliatory policy caused discontent 
among the rank-and-file of the National Charter Association. After repeated 
postponements a joint conference of Chartists and bourgeois radicals was 
convened in London on 8 February 1858. Marx and Engels regarded Jones' 
conciliation with the radicals as a manifestation of his political vacillation and 
broke off their friendly relations with him until a few years later, when Jones 
again adopted a revolutionary stand.—210, 249, 264, 375 
246 George Peabody was a big American financier. Frorn 1851 onwards, he gave 
annual dinners in London to British aristocrats and American guests to mark 
the anniversary of US independence (proclaimed on 4 July 1776).—212, 567 
247 Engels' information on Hamburg bankruptcies was reproduced almost word for 
word by Marx in his article 'The Crisis in Europe', published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune on 5 January 1858 (see present edition, Vol. 15).—213 
248 Marx dealt in greater detail with the consequences of the repeal of the Corn 
Laws during the crisis in his article 'The Financial Crisis in Europe', published 
in the New-York Daily Tribune on 22 December 1857 (see present edition, 
Vol. 15).—215 
249 This refers to the Hamburger Garantie-Diskonto-Verein founded at the end of 
November 1857 in connection with the money crisis in Hamburg, to facilitate 
the circulation of bills and banknotes bearing the stamp of this association.— 
216 
250 In the summer of 1857 Marx began to write a series of economic manuscripts 
in order to sum up and systematise the results of his extensive economic 
research started in the 1840s and continued most intensively in the 1850s. 
(In the first half of the 1850s he filled 24 paginated and several unpaginated 
notebooks with excerpts from the works of bourgeois economists, books of 
statistics, documents and periodicals.) These manuscripts were preliminary 
versions of an extensive economic work in which he intended to investigate the 
laws governing the development of capitalist production and to criticise 
bourgeois political economy. Marx oudined the main points of this treatise in 
an unfinished draft of the 'Introduction' (one of the first manuscripts of the 
series) and in letters to Engels, Lassalle and Weydemeyer (see pp. 298-304, 
269-71,  286-87, 376-78). Further economic study prompted Marx to specify 
and change his original plan. The central place in the series is occupied by the 
extensive manuscript, Critique of Political Economy (widely known as the 
Grundrisse), on which Marx worked from October 1857 to May 1858. In this 
preliminary draft of his future Capital Marx expounded his theory of surplus 
value. After the first instalment had been prepared for publication in 1859 
under the title A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx added 
several more manuscripts to the series in 1861. 
The manuscripts of 1857-61 were first published in German by the Institute 
of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU in 1939 under the editorial heading 
Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie (Rohentwurf). These manuscripts 
and A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One are included in 
Vols.  29 and 30 of the present edition.—217, 224, 226, 238, 244, 249, 256, 270,

253 This idea did not materialise.—224 
254 In his letter of 17 December 1857 to Marx, Lassalle enclosed a letter from his 
cousin Max Friedländer to Marx inviting him to contribute to the Vienna 
newspaper, Die  Presse.  Friedländer became one of its editors in 1856. Previously 
he had taken part in publishing the democratic paper Neu« Oder-Zeitung, to 
which Marx also contributed throughout 1855. Not knowing the political line of 
Die Presse at the time, Marx did not agree, one of the reasons being probably 
the condition imposed by Friedländer: to criticise Napoleon Ill's policy and 
abstain from attacking Palmerston. In 1859 negotiations with Friedländer were 
resumed and lasted for a long time. Their success was hampered, on the one 
hand, by Lassalle's pro-Bonapartist statements during the Italian war of 1859 
which evoked dissatisfaction on the part of Friedländer, who for a time 
thought that Marx approved of these statements, and on the other hand, by the 
editors' tendency to be duped by the pseudo-constitutional demagogy of the 
new Austrian government of Schmerling, which put Marx on the alert. Only in 
October 1861 when Die Presse criticised the government did Marx agree to be 
its London correspondent.—226, 227, 269, 272, 416, 418, 455, 571 
255 Crédit fancier (Land Credit)—a French joint-stock bank set up in 1852 on the 
basis of the former Paris Land Bank. It granted short- and long-term loans on 
the security of immovable property at a definite interest. The Crédit foncier 
received considerable subsidies from the government. 
Comptoir national d'Escompte de Paris (National Discount Bank of Paris) was 
founded in 1848 by the Provisional Government of the French Republic. 
Originally it discounted bills and granted credits on the security of goods stored 
in public warehouses. Under Napoleon III it became a joint-stock society (in 
1853) and acquired the privilege of making advances on government bonds 
and shares of industrial and credit companies.—230 
256 The  Zollverein, a union of German states which established a common customs 
frontier, was set up in 1834 under the aegis of Prussia. Brought into being by 
the need to create an all-German market, the Customs Union subsequendy 
embraced all the German states except Austria and a few of the smaller 
states.—  230 
257 Some of the thoughts expressed by Marx in this letter were developed in his 
article 'The Crisis in France', published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 12 
January 1858 (see present edition, Vol. 15).—232 
258 Further Engels refers to an episode in the Indian uprising of 1857-59 (see Note 
178).  After the fall of Delhi and Cawnpore in the summer of 1857, the centre 
of resistance to the British shifted to Oudh. A British garrison was besieged in 
Lucknow, the capital of that state, by the remnants of the Sepoy army and 
Oudh insurgents. General Havelock's force sent to relieve the garrison reached 
it in September but was compelled to remain besieged with it. It was not until 
November 1857 that the garrison was relieved by a force under General Colin 
Campbell from Cawnpore (Engels describes this episode). However, the 
insurgents' successful operations in Campbell's rear compelled him to leave 
Lucknow and return to Cawnpore. Campbell undertook another campaign to 
Lucknow three months later and captured the city on 19 March 1858.—234

pp. 227-28) has not been found.—239, 242, 250 
261 Engels' article 'Army' for The New American Cyclopaedia (on Marx's and Engels' 
contribution to the Cyclopaedia see Note 165) was published not in Vol. I but in 
Vol. II, which appeared in 1858.—239 
262 On 7 January 1858 Engels sent Marx three 'C articles: 'Campaign', 
'Cannonade' and 'Captain', which, according to an entry in Marx's notebook, 
were despatched to New York the next day with Marx's articles "The Siege and 
Storm of Lucknow' and 'Bolivar y Ponte'.—  241, 244 
26S -phe article 'Caps (Percussion)' was not printed in The New American 
Cyclopaedia.—241,  257, 259 
264 Marx refers to statistical data on England's balance of trade and the cost of her 
imports and exports during the Crimean war, 1854-56. He obtained these 
figures from a report of the Manchester Foreign Affairs Committee (see Note 
57), which was sent to him by the editors of the Urquhartite newspaper The 
Free Press before it was published. The Free Press itself did not publish it until 
13 January 1858. Marx used these figures in his article 'British Commerce' (see 
present edition, Vol. 15).—243 
265 During the march of General Campbell's troops from Cawnpore to Lucknow in 
November 1857 to relieve the garrison besieged by the Indian insurgents (see 
Note 258), General Windham's force, left behind to protect Cawnpore, was 
defeated by the insurgents on 27 November. This forced Campbell to return 
hastily to retake Cawnpore instead of consolidating in Lucknow. Later 
Engels described these events in the article 'Windham's Defeat', 
published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 20 February 1858 (see present

266 The original letter is dated 14 January 1858, which is an obvious slip of the 
pen. In fact the letter could not have been written earlier than 16 January for 
in it Marx informed Engels of Conrad Schramm's death on 15 January 1858, 
acknowledged receipt of Engels' article 'The Relief of Lucknow' despatched 
from Manchester to London on 14 January, as we see from Engels' letter of 
that date, and answered questions put to him in that same letter. Besides, in a 
letter to Engels on 23 January 1858 Marx mentioned this letter, saying it was 
'sent off a week ago today', i. e., 16 January. 
On the first English publication of this letter (datelined 14 January 1858) 
see Note  1.—248 
267 Marx refers to the Great Redan, Bastion No. 3 of the Sevastopol fortifications, 
which was attacked by the British at the time of the allies' decisive storm of the 
fortress on 8 September 1855, during the Crimean war (1853-56) of Britain, 
France, Turkey and Piedmont against Russia. The storm was repulsed by 
Sevastopol defenders. On this episode and Windham's role in it see Engels' 
article 'The Great Event of the War' (present edition, Vol. 14). 
On Windham's defeat by the Indian insurgents in November 1857 see Note 
265.-249 
268 Marx wrote about this in his articles on the Indian national liberation uprising, 
in particular in those published in the New-York Daily Tribune: 'The Revolt in 
India' (4 August 1857), 'Indian News' (14 August 1857), 'State of the Indian

Insurrection' (18 August 1857), etc. (present edition, Vol. 15).—249 
269 On 22 January 1858 Marx made an entry in his notebook about the receipt 
from Engels and the despatch to New York of the second batch of 'C articles 
for The New American Cyclopaedia, in particular 'Carabine', 'Carabineers', 
'Carcass', 'Carronade', 'Cartouche', 'Cartridge' and 'Case Shot' (see present 
edition, Vol. 18). The article 'Carabineers' was not published in the Cyclopaedia 
nor has the manuscript been preserved.—251 
270 At the end of his article 'Albuera' Engels noted that the siege of the 
French-held fortress of Badajos (Southwestern Spain) by the allied forces of 
Britain, Spain and Portugal was raised the day after their victory over the 
French at Albuera on 16 May 1811 (see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 10-11). In 
fact the fortress was besieged by the allies three times during the Peninsular 
War between Britain and Napoleonic France. The first siege in May 1811 was 
lifted before the battle of Albuera because of the approaching French reserves. 
On 25 May, following the victory at Albuera, the allies resumed the siege but 
they were forced to raise it on 17 June. The allies laid siege to Badajos for the 
third time in March 1812 and took it on 6 April. As Engels pointed out in his 
letter to Marx on 18 February 1858 (see this volume, p. 267), the inaccuracy in 
the article 'Albuera' is accounted for by a mistake in one of the sources he 
used.—251,  252, 267 
271 Marx refers to an attempt on the life of Napoleon III by the Italian 
revolutionary Felice Orsini on 14 January 1858. Orsini hoped thus to give an 
impetus to revolutionary actions in Europe and activate the struggle for Italy's 
unification. The attempt failed and Orsini was executed on 13 March of that 
year.—251,  255, 256, 257, 266, 271, 289 
272 No special article on the 1857 national liberation uprising in India was written 
for The New American Cyclopaedia. Later the description of this uprising was 
included in the article 'Hindoostan' published in the Cyclopaedia.—252 
273 Engels' letter to Harney has not been found.—253 
274 As can be seen from an entry in Marx's notebook, on 29 January 1858 he sent 
to New York the following articles received from Engels together with this 
letter: 'Berme', 'Blenheim' and 'Borodino'. In view of a new request from Dana 
for 'B' articles, which Marx forwarded to Engels on 23 January (see this 
volume, p. 251), Engels put off 'C articles and began fulfilling this 
request.—254 
275 The amnesty of political emigrants who had taken part in the 1848-49 
revolution in Germany was not proclaimed by the Prussian government until 
early 1861.—255, 266 
276 Marx refers to the position of Louis Bonaparte as President of the French 
Republic before the coup d'état of 2 December 1851. His term as president was 
to expire early in May 1852, and according to the republic's Constitution a 
person could be elected to the post a second time only after a four-year 
interval. So Louis Bonaparte was in danger not only of losing his power and 
salary but also of being prosecuted for numerous debts.—256 
277 Marx developed these ideas in his article 'An Attempt on Bonaparte' published 
in the New-York Daily Tribune on 22 February 1858 (see present edition, 
Vol. 15).—256 
278 Lassalle's book on political economy was published in Berlin only in 1864 under

und Arbeit—  261, 355, 396, 542, 547 
279 Marx alludes to the peak of the 1857-58 economic crisis experienced by the 
Manchester businessmen. He calls it the 'Sturm- und Drangperiode' by analogy 
with the well-known literary movement in Germany in the last three decades of 
the 18th century, which reflected the discontent of progressive sections of 
society with the feudal absolutist systems in German states.—263 
280 jn 1842 bourgeois radical Free Traders made attempts to obtain control of the 
Chartist movement. To divert the workers from the Chartists' social and 
political programme they put forward a vague demand for what they called 
'complete suffrage'. Joseph Sturge, Edward Miall, Joseph Livesay and other 
radicals, supported by some conciliatory-minded Chartist leaders (Lovett and 
others), managed to convoke two conferences of bourgeois radicals and 
Chartists in Birmingham in 1842 to discuss a joint campaign for electoral 
reform. However, the Chartist majority at the conferences rejected the 
proposal to substitute a new 'BUI of Rights' and the 'complete suffrage' demand 
for the People's Charter, which led to a break between the Chartists and 
radicals.—264 
281 After Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III on 14 January 1858, Le 
Moniteur universel and other official newspapers began publishing chauvinistic 
addresses of loyalty by higher social and military circles. Many of them accused 
Britain of granting asylum to terrorists and assassins like Orsini and demanded 
that they be persecuted in their 'den'. The publication of these addresses was 
regarded in Britain as an indirect threat and caused an aggravation of 
Anglo-French relations in 1858.—264 
282 when Marx wrote the article 'Bolivar y Ponte', the history of the Latin 
American countries' war for independence (1810-26) had not yet been 
adequately studied. Books and memoirs by European adventurers who had 
taken part in the war out of mercenary motives were widely read at the time 
(among them Ducoudray Holstein, a Frenchman who had become Bolivar's 
personal enemy, and the Englishman G. Hippisley). The authors of these books 
attributed numerous vices to Bolivar (perfidity, arrogance, cowardice) and 
presented his struggle against federalist and separatist elements for the 
unification of the Latin American republics as a striving for dictatorship. In 
reality, Simon Bolivar played an outstanding role in the struggle of several 
Latin American countries for liberation from the Spanish yoke, the establish­
ment of republican forms of government and for progressive bourgeois 
reforms. 
Marx had only the above-mentioned biassed sources at his disposal. Hence 
his inevitably one-sided view of Bolivar's personality in his article, in this letter 
and in Herr Vogt written later (see present edition, Vol. 17); His attitude to 
Bolivar was to a certain extent determined by the fact that the sources he used 
exaggerated Bolivar's striving for personal power, and over-emphasised the 
Bonapartist features against which Marx and Engels were then waging a 
relendess struggle. Nevertheless, Marx pointed out the progressive aspects of 
Bolivar's activity, such as his emancipation of Negro slaves, and on the whole 
appreciated the revolutionary anti-colonial struggle for national liberation in 
Latin America.—266 
28S Marx alludes to the rumours about the illegitimate birth of Napoleon III, 
whose official father was Napoleon I's brother Louis Bonaparte, King of 
Holland in 1806-10.—266

284 Marx refers to an article in  Cobbett's  Annual Register. From July to December, 1802 
(Vol. II, London, 1810, columns 128-33) on the aggravation of Anglo-French 
relations during Napoleon's consulate because of the anti-Napoleonic statements 
in the press by French political refugees in England. Later Marx used this article 
and passages quoted in it from Le Moniteur universel, No. 320, 9 August 
1802,  for his article 'The French Trials in London' published in the New-
York Daily Tribune on 27 April 1858 (see present edition, Vol. 15).— 
266 
285 Engels presumably refers to his articles 'Camp' and 'Catapult' for The New 
American Cyclopaedia. Marx helped Engels to collect material for them (see, for 
example, Marx's letter to Engels of 1 February 1858). There is no entry in 
Marx's notebook about their despatch to New York. It is quite possible that 
Engels sent Marx the article 'Coehorn' with 'Camp' and 'Catapult'.—267 
286 An  excerpt from this letter was first published in English in Marx and Engels, 
Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1955 
and in full in The Letters of Karl Marx, selected and translated with explanatory 
notes and an introduction by Saul K. Padover, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood 
Cliff,  New Jersey, 1979.—268 
287 After Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III, Count Walewski, Foreign 
Minister of France, sent the British government a despatch on 20 January 1858 
expressing his discontent at Britain's granting asylum to French political 
refugees. The despatch served as a pretext for Palmerston to introduce a new 
Aliens Bill, also called Conspiracy to Murder Bill (see Note 16), on 8 February 
1858.  According to this Bill, anyone living in the United Kingdom, an 
Englishman or a foreigner, who took part in a conspiracy to murder a person 
in Britain or any other country, was to be tried by an English court and 
severely punished. During the second reading of the new Aliens Bill the 
radicals Milner Gibson and John Bright, who had been defeated at the 
parliamentary elections in March 1857, when the Whigs, Palmerston's 
adherents, came to power, but were re-elected in the autumn of that year, 
moved an amendment censuring Palmerston's government for failing to give a 
fitting reply to Walewski's despatch. The House of Commons adopted the 
amendment by a majority vote, rejected the Bill and compelled Palmerston's 
government to resign.—273, 275 
288 Marx analyses the state of France's economy, including agriculture, in early 
1858 in his article 'The Economic Crisis in France' published in the New-York 
Daily Tribune on 12 March 1858 (see present edition, Vol. 15).—273 
289 A reference to the second Anglo-Burmese war (1852) which resulted in the 
British capture of the Province of Pegu.—274 
290 By '2 cives romani [Roman citizens]' Engels means the British Prime Minister 
Palmerston and Napoleon III. (He alludes here to the Latin expression 'civis 
Romanus sum'—'I am a Roman citizen' cited by Palmerston in his speech in 
the House of Commons on 25 June 1850.) Engels has in mind in particular their 
intention to send an English and a French squadron to the shores of Naples at the 
end of 1856 under the pretext of bringing pressure to bear on the reactionary 
regime there (see Note 103), and their repressive measures against democrats in 
France and Britain after Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III.—

293 In their 'Letter to the Parliament and the Press' of 24 February 1858 (an 
English translation was published in London as a separate booklet), Pyat, 
Besson and Talandier stated that the crowned personages who usurped 
political power as Napoleon III had done, deserved to die a violent death and 
that their assassination would be a justified historical act. The letter caused 
excitement among British ruling circles and in the British press. Marx sharply 
criticised such adventurist statements by French petty-bourgeois refugees and 
their terroristic ideas.—278, 279 
294 An allusion to Félix Pyat, who contributed to the French satirical journal Le 
Charivari in the 1830s and 1840s and wrote a number of plays for the Théâtre 
du Port Saint-Martin (Paris).—278 
295 The Honourable Gentleman opposite—a form of address used in the British 
Parliament in respect of an M.P. in the opposition.—278 
296 Engels means the German liberals and petty-bourgeois democrats who 
supported the German Imperial Constitution of 1849 (see Note 116).—279 
297 Marx refers to a letter he received from Friedrich Kamm dated 19 December 
1857.  Kamm, a German refugee in America, wrote that he and his friends had 
set up a Communist Club in New York and asked Marx to send him 
information about the communist movement in Europe, certain theoretical 
works and Communist League documents. He also asked for practical advice in 
organising the work of a newly founded club. Marx's reply has not been found, 
but his letter to Joseph Weydemeyer of 1 February 1859 shows that he 
corresponded with Albrecht Komp, another leader of the New York 
Communist Club (see this volume, p. 376).—282, 288, 293, 469 
298 In 1806, an English expedition under Captain Popam and General Beresford 
was sent to capture Buenos Aires, which belonged to Spain, then an ally of 
Napoleonic France. Meeting with no serious resistance from the Spanish 
colonial authorities, Beresford's force seized Buenos Aires but was surrounded 
and compelled to surrender by the Argentine patriots.—285 
299 This letter is Marx's reply to Lassalle's letter of 3 March 1858, containing a 
number of questions regarding the publication of Marx's economic work (see 
this volume, pp. 269-71). 
On the first English publication of Marx's letter see Note 82.—286 
300 fhe Seven Years War (1756-63)—a war of Britain and Prussia against Austria, 
France, Russia, Saxony and Sweden. As a result of it France ceded many of its 
colonies (including Canada and almost all its possessions in the East Indies) to 
Britain, while Prussia, Austria and Saxony were obliged to recognise in the 
main its pre-war frontiers.—289, 294, 561

the Seine embankment, where some participants in the June 1848 uprising in 
Paris were detained after its defeat.—290

that he 'detests and abominates democracy'.—290 
303 -["hg Legitimists—supporters of the Bourbon dynasty overthrown in 1830. They 
upheld the interests of the big hereditary landowners. 
During the Second Republic the Orleanists (see Note 124) and the Legitimists 
formed the 'party of Order', an influential conservative bloc in the Legislative 
Assembly (1849-51), which Engels has in mind when he speaks, further on in the 
text, about the joint rule of these groups under the constitutional-republican 
system.—291,  552 
304 A reference to La loi relatif à des mesures de sûreté générale (Law on Public 
Security Measures) known as La loi des suspects (Suspects Law) adopted by the 
Corps législatif (see Note 123) on 19 February and promulgated on 28 February 
1858.  It gave the Emperor and his government unlimited power to exile 
to different parts of France or Algeria or to banish altogether from French ter­
ritory any person suspected of hostility to the Second Empire.— 
291 
306 Engels refers to the marriage in London on 25 January 1858 of Frederick William, 
the son of Prince William of Prussia (later King and Emperor William I), and the 
English Princess Victoria Adelaide Marie Louise, Queen Victoria's eldest 
daughter.—292 
306 In 1848, during the Second Republic, the monarchist Louis Adolphe Thiers 
actively supported Louis Bonaparte's candidature for the presidency. But later, 
as a leader of the Orleanist wing of the 'party of Order' plotting the restoration 
of the Orleans dynasty, he and other members of the party entered into 
conflict with Louis Bonaparte and his entourage During the Bonapartist coup 
d'état of 2 December 1851 Thiers was arrested and, after a short detention in 
the Mazas prison in Paris, was banished from France. Upon his return in 
August 1852 he became a member of the 'society opposition'.—292 
SO' Marx refers to a conference of the delegates of the Italian National Constitutional 
League, the liberal-minded big bourgeoisie and nobility, held in London on 
1 March 1858. It adopted a number of mainly declarative resolutions, 
proclaiming the necessity to form a federation of Italian states, introduce a 
Constitution preserving the monarchic government, and carry out a number of 
liberal reforms. A special resolution condemned Orsini's attempt on the life of 
Napoleon III.—294 
308 Under Napoleon Ill's decree of 27 January 1858 the whole of French territory 
was divided into five military districts, with Paris, Nancy, Lyons, Toulouse and 
Tours as their centres and Marshals Magnan, Baraguay d'Hilliers, Bosquet, 
Castellane and Canrobert as their commanders. Marx calls these districts 
pashaliks (a comparison earlier used by the French republican press), to 
emphasise the similarity of the unlimited powers of the reactionary Marshals 
and the despotic power of the Turkish pashas.—296 
309 Captain-generalships—administrative districts set up in Spain and its colonies in 
the sixteenth century, during the period of absolute monarchy. Civil and

314 Surgeon Simon Bernard, a Frenchman living in London, was tried as an 
accomplice in Felice Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon HI (manufacture 
of bombs and so on). The trial took place in London from 12 to 17 April 1858. 
Bernard was acquitted by the Central Criminal Court on 17 April.—307, 309 
315 In April 1858 the Chamber of Representatives of the Kingdom of Piedmont 
discussed a conspiracy bill. Introduced at the request of Napoleon Ill's 
government, it envisaged measures against attempts on the life of foreign 
monarchs. During the debate on 16 and 17 April, Prime Minister Cavour and 
General La Marmora recalled the summer 1848 events and exposed the policy 
of the bourgeois republican general Cavaignac, then head of the executive in 
France, who refused to support revolutionary Italy in her struggle against 
Austria.—309 
316 Marx refers to the Government Commission on the Workers' Question which 
jnet at the Palais du Luxembourg and was presided over by Louis Blanc. The 
Commission was set up on 28 February 1848 by the Provisional Government of 
the French Republic under pressure from workers who demanded a Ministry of 
Labour. It consisted of workers and employers and acted as a mediator in 
labour conflicts, often taking the side of the employers. On the very next day 
after the mass actions of 15 May 1848, the government disbanded the 
Luxembourg Commission.—310 
317 Later Marx wrote two articles on this subject: 'A Curious Piece of History' and 
'Another Strange Chapter of Modern History', published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune on 16 June and 23 September 1858.—310 
318 Marx stayed with Engels in Manchester from 6 to about 24 May. To recover his 
health he practised sport, riding, etc. While in Manchester Marx continued 
working on the economic manuscript of 1857-58 (see Note 250), intending to 
complete his research and begin preparations for publication of the first part of 
his work, A Contribution to the Critique of Political  Economy.—  312,  315, 368 
319 Marx refers to Napoleon Ill's representation to the Council of State on the 
introduction of a law on confiscation of landed property of philanthropic 
institutions and converting it into state interest-bearing securities. 
Marx discussed this problem at length in his article 'Bonaparte's Financial 
Manoeuvres.—Military Despotism' (present edition, Vol. 15).—317 
320 Marx received Engels' article 'Cavalry', written for The New American 
Cyclopaedia, by 22 June 1858 and, as seen from an entry in his notebook, sent it 
off to New York the same day.—323

A. Komp's letter of 15 June 1858 from New York, both written tcijùjn. Marx 
did not enclose them m his letter to Engels and they were mislaid^Hrong h'ft '

found but we may judge of its contents by the above-mentioned letter to 
Weydemeyer. Komp was a leader of the New York Communist Club, and his 
letter to Marx contained information and requests similar to those contained in 
a letter from Friedrich Kamm, another leader of the Club, written on 
19 December 1857 (see Note 297). After replying to his American correspondents, 
Marx forwarded their letters to Engels on 9 February 1859 (see this volume, 
pp. 384-85).—324, 326, 337, 339, 374, 384

in Manchester.—332 
324 Marx's letter to his mother has not been found.—334 
325 This presumably refers to Engels' article written between 16 and 20 July 1858 
and published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 13 August. Marx made an 
entry in his notebook on 27 July about the despatch of the article to New York, 
giving its heading as 'Transport of Troops to India' (see present edition, 
Vol. 15). The Tribune editors introduced changes into the article and printed it 
under the heading 'How the Indian War has been Mismanaged'.—334 
326 The original letter is dated 4 August 1858, which is presumably a slip of the 
pen, for in it Marx mentions events about which he could have learned from 
the newspapers only later: the opening of the Cherbourg naval port after its 
reconstruction and the actions of Napoleon Ill's government in connection 
with this. Engels' reply of 10 August 1858 warrants the assumption that Marx 
wrote the letter on 8 August. 
On the first English publication of the letter see Note 20.—335 
327 This seems to refer to Engels' letter in reply to Marx's letter of 25 July 1858 
(see this volume, p. 334). The letter has not been found.—335 
328 Marx refers to the festivities on the occasion of the opening, on 4 August 1858, 
of the Cherbourg naval port after its reconstruction. 
On the invitation of the French government, Queen Victoria of the United 
Kingdom and the Prince Consort Albert attended the ceremony. According to 
Napoleon Ill's plans, the reception given them was to relax the tension in 
Anglo-French relations after Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III (see 
Note 271). However, the demonstration of France's naval strength in 
Cherbourg aroused new British apprehensions. In this connection Napoleon 
declared in a Note of 7 August 1858 that the reconstruction of the naval port 
did not pursue any hostile aims towards Britain.—  336,  339, 340 
329 Félix Pyat's letter was written on 14 July 1858 and published separately under

Crises and Currency in Britain', printed in the New-York Daily Tribune on 23 
and 28 August 1858 as leaders, and 'British Commerce and Finance', published 
on 4 October.—342

and France with China during the second Opium War (1856-60). The treaties 
made new ports available to foreign trade; foreign diplomatic representatives 
were authorised in Peking; foreigners were allowed to travel freely in the 
country for commercial or other purposes; Britain and France received 
economic privileges through the introduction of new commercial rules 
legalising the opium trade, and were paid indemnities. 
Marx discussed these treaties in his articles written in August and early 
September for the New-York Daily Tribune: 'History of the Opium Trade' and 
'The Anglo-Chinese Treaty' (see present edition, Vol. 16). However, the article 
mentioned in this letter was not published in the Tribune.—342, 347, 362, 387 
333 Engels refers to the official despatches of Lord Canning, Governor General of 
India, of 17 June and 4 July 1858 to the Secret Committee of the Court of 
Directors of the British East India Company (they were published in The Times, 
No. 23117, 6 October 1858). 
In these despatches Canning defended his proclamation of 3 March 1858 
on the confiscation, in favour of Britain, of the lands of Oudh, including the 
estates of the local feudal lords who had joined the Indian uprising. (Marx 
assessed this proclamation in his article 'The Annexation of Oudh' published in 
the New-York Daily Tribune on 28 May 1858; see present edition, Vol. 15.) 
Canning's point of view was not shared by a number of prominent colonial 
officials and M.P.s who favoured a more flexible policy towards the Indian 
feudal lords and hoped to win them over with promises to leave their domains 
intact. 
Marx did not write any article about Canning's despatches.—343 
334 Engels seems to refer to Jones' speech at a Chartist meeting in Manchester on 
4 October 1858, a brief account of which was published in  The,  Leader,  No. 446, 
9 October 1858, in the 'Political Foreshadowings' section. 
About Jones' temporary vacillations and his policy of compromise with 
bourgeois radicals see Note 245.—344, 345 
335 Marx writes here about the revolutionary situation in Russia after her defeat in 
the Crimean war (1853-56). Fearing the growing peasant unrest, Alexan­
der II's government was forced to start preparations for the abolition of 
serfdom. On 3 January 1857 a Secret Committee consisting of high 
government officials and headed by the Emperor was formed to discuss the 
peasant question. In January 1858 the Committee was made public and 
renamed the Chief Peasant Question Committee. 
To discuss the draft peasant reform, it was proposed to hold in 
St. Petersburg a congress of deputies of the Gubernia Landowners' Commit­
tees,  called by Marx the 'convocation of notables' by analogy with the 
convocation of notables in France on the eve of the French Revolution. The 
congress took place in the autumn of 1859.—346, 349 
336 jn  view  0f the insanity of Frederick William IV of Prussia the question arose of 
appointing Regent his brother, Prince William of Prussia (later King and Emperor 
William I). The Prussian bourgeoisie hoped that the Regency would lead to liberal 
reforms and remove Manteuffel's reactionary ministry, although the reactionary 
measures taken by the Prince of Prussia in 1848 gave little ground for such 
hopes.  Nevertheless, similar illusions about the advent of 'a new era' were 
widespread among liberal monarchist circles. Prince William was appointed 
Regent on 7 October 1858.—346, 348, 410, 470, 571

ländlichen Einrichtungen Russlands (Th. 1-3, Hannover-Berlin, 1847-52), the 
Prussian official and writer August Haxthausen who toured Russia in the 
1840s, gave a false idea of the material well-being of the Russian peasantry. He 
advocated preservation of the peasant commune arguing that this was the only 
way to save Russia from the revolutionary consequences of its toiling people 
becoming proletarian. He thought that the abolition of serfdom should be 
carried out gradually because, he wrote, the necessary conditions for the wage 
labour system did not exist in Russia.—346 
338 This refers to one of the main provisions of the Nanking Treaty Britain 
concluded with China as a result of the Anglo-Chinese war of 1840-42 (known 
as the first Opium War). It was the first of a series of unequal treaties imposed 
on China by the Western powers, treaties that reduced it to the status of a 
semi-colony. Under the Nanking Treaty five Chinese cities—Canton, Shanghai, 
Amoy, Ninbo and Fuchon—were opened to English trade.—347 
339 Under the Aigun Treaty of 28(16) May 1858, the left bank of the Amur, from 
the confluence of the Shilka and the Argun to the sea, was recognised as 
Russian territory, while the question of the Ussuri Area, from the confluence of 
the Ussuri and the Amur to -the sea, was left open until the final fixing of the 
frontier between Russia and China. Navigation on the Amur, Sungari and 
Ussuri was prohibited to all states except Russia and Ching China. The treaty 
thus returned to Russia the left bank of the Amur developed by die Russians in 
the seventeenth century and taken from it under the Nerchinsk Treaty of 
1689.  Besides, it thwarted the British diplomats' attempt to exacerbate 
Russo-Chinese relations and closed the Amur to West-European shipping. The 
treaty was ratified by Russia on 8 June 1858.—349 
340 This letter is dated only 'Friday'. The exact date of its writing was established 
on the basis of facts mentioned in it, in particular Marx's reference to an article 
on rifled cannon published in The Times on 22 October 1858.—350 
341 Marx seems to refer to his article 'Mr. John Bright' printed in the New-York 
Daily Tribune on 12 November 1858 as a leader, without any heading. It bears 
signs of the editors' interference (see present edition, Vol. 16).—350 
342 A reference to the conflict between France and Portugal caused by the seizure 
of the French merchant vessel Charles et Georges by the Portuguese authorities 
in Mozambique on 29 November 1857. The vessel had on board a number of 
East-African Negroes who were to be shipped, allegedly as free emigrants, to 
the French island of Réunion. 
The Franco-Portuguese talks continued for almost a year but brought no 
results. On 13 October 1858 Napoleon III, whom Marx calls here Quasimodo 
(a character from Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris), sent a special Note to the 
Portuguese Government demanding the return of the confiscated vessel and 
the release of its captain. The demand was backed by the despatch of two 
French warships to the Portuguese capital. Portugal was compelled to yield. 
Marx touches on the subject in his article 'The French Slave Trade' 
published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 1 December 1858 with considerable 
editorial changes (see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 621-23).—351, 357 
343 This presumably refers to Blind's articles published anonymously in 1858 
under the general heading Flügblätter des Vereins 'Deutsche Einheit und Freiheit' in 
England.— 351, 353 
344 John Bright, a British radical and Free Trade leader, put forward a

programme for electoral reform. Of the six points of the People's Charter 
(universal suffrage, annual Parliaments, vote by secret ballot, equal constituencies, 
abolition of property qualifications for candidates to Parliament, and payment of 
M.P.s), he retained only the demand for vote by secret ballot. The other demands 
were either omitted altogether or drastically moderated. Thus Bright suggested 
that suffrage should be granted only to persons paying property tax; in place of 
equal constituencies he suggested fairer representation for the existing 
constituencies.—358 
345 Marx refers to Freiligrath's letter to him of 6 December 1858 and Freiligrath's 
poem 'Nach Johanna Kinkels Begräbnis' (written on 20 November 1858 on the 
occasion of the death of Cottfried Kinkel's wife, Johanna Kinkel, and published 
in Die Neue Zeit, No. 24, 11 December 1859).—359 
346 Cayenne—a place in French Guiana where political prisoners were sent for 
penal servitude. The high mortality caused by the hard prison conditions and 
the unhealthy tropical climate earned it the nickname of the 'Dry Guillotine'.—

347 Marx is mistaken here. Fitzgerald and Stanley could not have spoken in the 
House of Commons on Monday, 13 December, for Parliament did not meet 
from 2 August 1858 to early January 1859. On 14 December The Times 
(No.  23176) reprinted excerpts from Lord Stanley's speech of 13 December 
1858 before the young cadets of the Manchester military school, one of the 
topics being the situation in India. (The speech was reported in greater detail 
in The Manchester Guardian.) Fitzgerald too may have spoken at this meeting. 
This warrants the assumption that Marx actually meant these speeches.—363 
348 Marx means his new article on the Anglo-Chinese Treaty. It was not published 
by the New-York Daily Tribune.—363 
349 In his Message to the XXXVth Congress of 6 December 1858, President James 
Buchanan expressed US aggressive intentions as regards Costa Rica, Nicaragua, 
Brazil, Paraguay and other countries of Central and South America and ÜS 
strivings for supremacy on the American continent. In the sphere of home 
policy, Buchanan asked Congress to increase allocations for the navy and the 
Postal Department in 1858 and urged the construction of a Pacific railroad. 
Marx's article about Buchanan's message was not published by the New-York 
Daily Tribune.—364 
350 Marx had asked Engels to write an article for the New-York Daily Tribune about 
the events in the principality of Serbia. On 30 November 1858 the so-called 
St. Andrew Skupstina met after a long interval. At the session, the liberals, who 
had joined forces with the supporters of the Obrenovic dynasty, clashed with 
the ruling Ustavobranitelji (Defenders of Constitution) group representing the 
big landowners, traders and the top officialdom. The conflict led to the 
deposition of Alexander Karageorgievic and the reinstatement of Milos 
Obrenovic, who agreed to carry out a number of liberal reforms. The St. 
Andrew Skupstina abolished the oligarchic council set up under the 1838 
Constitution, restored the Skupstina as a permanent legislative body, and 
declared freedom of the press. Though the liberal reforms were moderate and 
short-lived, the fall of the Ustavobranitelji regime gave an impulse to Serbia's 
economic and cultural development. 
It is unknown whether Engels wrote the article on Serbia.—364, 366 
351 Presumably Engels did not write any article on the proposed changes in the 
Prussian army. Later, when France and Piedmont were on a collision course with

Austria, he wrote the article 'German Resources for War' (on 10 February 1859) in 
which he also described the state of Prussia's armed forces (see present edition, 
Vol. 16).—366, 368 
352 Gottfried Kinkel called his weekly after Arminius (Hermann), the leader of the 
Germanic tribes' struggle against Roman rule in the first century A. D. Marx hints 
at the coincidence of this title with the name of the hero of Goethe's poem 
'Hermann und Dorothea', a simple, patriarchally-minded man striving for peace 
and a domestic idyll.—366 
S53 The prospectus for the Hermann was an advertisement announcing the 
forthcoming publication of the weekly, dated 24 December 1858 and signed by 
Kinkel. 
Marx's letter to Freiligrath about 'the Kinkel affair' has not been 
found.—367 
354 The  letter is not dated. The approximate time of its writing has been 
established on the basis of the facts mentioned in it, in particular the reference 
to Marx's rewriting of Engels' article on Napoleon Ill's policy, as a result of 
which the article 'The Money Panic in Europe' virtually written by them both, 
was sent to New York, its final version having been written on 13 January 1859 
(see present edition, Vol. 16). The letter could hardly have been sent off to 
Manchester later than 15 January because, judging by its opening lines, Marx 
was expecting a new article for the New-York Daily Tribune from Engels by 
Tuesday, 18 January.—367 
355 Marx means the 'Chapter on Capital', which constitutes the bulk of his economic 
manuscripts of 1857-58 (see Note 250) and was written from October 1857 to May 
1858 (see present edition, Vols. 29 and 30).—368, 389 
356 In the autumn of 1858, Palmerston, then head of the Whig opposition to the 
Derby-Disraeli Tory Cabinet, was invited by Napoleon III to Compiègne in 
order to clarify his position on the impending Franco-Austrian war. At the 
meeting Palmerston did not object to the Austrians being expelled from Italy, 
but in his speech at the opening of Parliament on 3 February 1859 he 
condemned France's action. 
On Russia's influence on Napoleon Ill's policy see Marx's article 'The War 
Prospect in France' (present edition, Vol. 16). 
The Peace Treaty of Paris concluded the Crimean war (1853-56). It was 
signed at the Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856 by Austria, Britain, France, 
Prussia, Sardinia and Turkey, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other. 
Under the treaty, Russia ceded the mouth of the Danube and part of 
Bessarabia, renounced its protectorate over the Danubian principalities and its 
protection of Christians in Turkey, agreed to the neutralisation of the Black 
Sea and returned the fortress of Kars to Turkey in exchange for Sevastopol 
and other Russian towns held by the Allies. By skilfully exploiting the 
differences between Britain and France the Russian diplomats at the Congress 
blocked the attempts to impose even more onerous peace terms on 
Russia.—368, 411, 431 
357 This draft of Engels' letter to Freiligrath was enclosed by Engels in his letter to 
Marx of 27 January 1859 (see this volume, p. 373). As follows from that 
letter, a three-page fair copy was sent to Freiligrath on 26 January. Neither the 
fair copy nor the other draft versions which Engels made while writing the 
letter have been preserved.—370 
358 In a letter to Engels that has not reached us Freiligrath probably wrote about

the projected publication of a new revolutionary newspaper which was to be a 
sequel to the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, organ of the proletarian wing of the 
democratic movement during the 1848-49 revolution in Germany. Freiligrath 
seems to have given an incorrect interpretation of the trend of the future 
newspaper as against that of the petty-bourgeois weekly Hermann which 
Gottfried Kinkel began to publish on 1 January 1859.—370, 372 
359 Engels paraphrases the dictum 'They have learned nothing and forgotten 
nothing', which during the restoration of the Bourbons (1815-30) was often 
applied to their conservative supporters who had failed to draw any lessons 
from the French Revolution. The dictum was first used, also in referring to the 
French extreme royalists, by Rear Admiral Chevalier de Panât in a letter to the 
journalist Mallet du Pan in 1796. In later years it was often attributed to 
Charles Talleyrand.—370 
360 The handwritten weekly Der Maikäfer, eine Zeitschrift für Nicht-Philister 
(May-Bug, a Journal for Non-Philistines) was founded by Gottfried Kinkel and 
Johanna Mockel in Bonn in 1840, at the time when the literary May-Bug Club 
was set up. With the outbreak of the revolution in Germany in 1848, both the 
journal and the club ceased to exist. Marx and Engels gave an ironic 
characterisation of the periodical and the club in the pamphlet  77K  Great Men 
of the Exile (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 244).—370 
361 The letter is not dated. The approximate time of its writing has been 
established on the basis of a reply letter from Engels. The article mentioned 
below was not published by the editors of the New-York Daily Tribune.—371, 
373 
362 Between September 1851 and March 1852 Gottfried Kinkel toured America in 
an attempt to raise a so-called German-American revolutionary loan. It was to 
be floated among German refugees and Americans of German extraction and 
used to begin an immediate revolution in Germany. During the tour Kinkel 
conducted a slanderous campaign against Marx and Engels. The attempt to 
distribute the 'revolutionary loan' failed. Marx and Engels in a number of 
works and letters denounced the undertaking as an adventurist attempt to 
produce a revolution artificially during a period when the revolutionary 
movement was on the wane.—372 
363 Marx's description of Princess Clotilde, daughter of King Victor Emmanuel of 
Piedmont (Sardinia), as a 'mild, angelic child' is clearly ironic. When writing 
about her forthcoming marriage to Napoleon Ill's cousin, Jerome Bonaparte 
(nicknamed Plon-Plon), in his article 'Louis Napoleon's Position' mentioned in 
this letter, Marx notes that Clotilde, 'despite her young years, is very 
strong-minded' (Vol. 16, p. 169).—373 
364 See Note 45.-374, 567 
365 Marx is mistaken here: Georg Weerth died in Havana, Cuba (see Note 
85).—374 
366 In 1751 J. Ch. Gottsched published in Leipzig an epic poem by Ch. O. von 
Schönaich devoted to Arminius (Hermann), the leader of the Germanic tribes that 
had revolted against Roman rule. Gottsched supplied the poem with a laudatory 
preface, and on his recommendation the Leipzig University crowned Schönaich 
with the laurels of a poet in 1752.—375

applied to German and other refugees, primarily petty-bourgeois democrats, 
who after the 1848-49 revolution engaged in pseudo-revolutionary activities, 
organised plots, raised 'revolutionary loans', formed governments in exile, and 
the like. In their joint work The Great Men of the Exile (present edition, Vol. 11) 
Marx and Engels gave a satirical description of some of them.—376, 500, 502 
368 In its issue of 19 October 1711, The Spectator propounded the idea that the 
price of commodities depended on the mass of money in circulation, a view 
shared by Montesquieu and Hume. In criticising this view in his A Contribution 
to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx referred to this issue of the journal 
(present edition, Vol. 30).—377 
369 In his article 'The French Army' sent to the New-York Daily Tribune on 
31 January 1859, Engels opposed his calculations concerning the strength of 
the forces France could field in Italy in case of war to the exaggerated figures 
contained in Louis Boniface's article datelined Paris, 29 January 1859, which 
appeared in the Constitutionnel, No. 30, on 30 January 1859. Engels pointed 
out that the Constitutionnel data had been furnished by the Emperor himself 
(see present edition, Vol. 16, p. 171). A report of 31 January from Paris, 
published in The Times, No. 23219, on 2 February 1859, stated outright that 
Napoleon III, whom Marx calls in this letter Mr Boustrapa (see Note 40), was 
the author of the article in the Constitutionnel. —379 
370 xhis refers to the war preparations of the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) and 
France against Austria. The war (29 April to 8 July 1859) was launched by 
Napoleon III, who under the banner of the 'liberation of Italy' strove for 
aggrandizement and needed a successful military campaign to shore up the 
Bonapartist regime in France. Piedmont ruling circles hoped that French 
support would enable them to unite Italy under the aegis of the Savoy dynasty. 
The war caused an upsurge of the national liberation movement in Italy. The 
Austrian army suffered a series of defeats. However Napoleon III, frightened 
by the scale of the liberation movement in Italy, abruptly ceased hostilities. On 
11 July, the French and Austrian emperors concluded a separate preliminary 
peace in Villafranca. France received Savoy and Nice; Lombardy was annexed 
to Sardinia; the Venetian Region remained under the Austrians.—380, 399, 
401, 405, 462, 537 
371 Marx refers here to the Carbonari, members of secret political societies in Italy 
and France in the first half of the nineteenth century. In Italy they fought for 
national independence, unification of the country and liberal constitutional 
reforms. 
In the latter half of the 1850s a number of attempts were made on the life 
of Napoleon III, including one by the Italian revolutionary Orsini (see Note 
271).  Some of these attempts were attributed to the desire to teach 
Napoleon III a lesson for the breach of his commitments to the Carbonari 
organisation, of which he was a member in 1831. Part of the questions touched 
upon in this letter are discussed in the articles "The Money Panic in Europe' by 
Marx and Engels, 'Louis Napoleon's Position' by Marx and 'The French Army' 
by Engels (all three are in Vol. 16 of the present edition).—380 
372 The Rubicon—the name of a river in Northern Italy, on the boundary between 
Umbria and Cisalpine Gaul, which Caesar crossed with his army in 49 B.C. 
thereby starting a civil war with Pompey. To cross (or pass) the Rubicon—to 
embark on an undertaking from which one cannot turn back.—381

and Strasbourg on 30 October 1836, and to the coup d'état in Paris on, 2 
December 1851 which led to the establishment of Napoleon Ill's dictatorship 
and the proclamation of the Second Empire in 1852.—381 
374 Marx probably means the tribute to Johanna Mockel, Gottfried Kinkel's wife, 
published in The Daily Telegraph by the German writer Fanny Lewald (Stahr). 
Marx mentions it in his letter to Lassalle of 3 March 1860 (see present edition, 
Vol. 41).—383 
375 The New-York Daily Tribune did not publish this article by Marx.—384 
376 On 8 February 1859 Georg Eccarius wrote to Marx saying it had been 
definitely established that he had consumption. While expressing his readiness to 
endure his misfortune with fortitude, he wrote about his apprehensions 
concerning the possible consequences of his disease for his family. In 
conclusion he asked Marx to send him books for self-education.—386 
377 The letter has not been found.—388 
378 The letter is not dated. The approximate time of its writing can be deduced 
from Marx's mentioning that his brother-in-law, Johann Carl Juta, would be 
travelling to Manchester, and from the fact that on 22 February 1859 Marx 
wrote a letter of recommendation to Engels for him.— 389 
379 Engels informed Marx of his intention to write the pamphlet Po and Phine (see 
present edition, Vol. 16) in a letter written in the second half of February 1859 
(it has not reached us). In the same letter he obviously oudined the content of 
the planned work, which Marx then set forth in this letter to Lassalle. Engels 
finished the pamphlet by 9 March 1859.—391, 393 
380 Engels took part in the Baden-Palatinate uprising in June-July 1849 with the 
detachment of August Willich, whose adjutant he was. He participated in four 
batdes, including the big one at Rastatt. — 392 
381 Marx refers to the fact that Ferdinand Lassalle was close to the opposition 
elements of the Prussian liberal bourgeoisie grouped round the Berlin 
Volks-Zeitung. On 31 January 1859 Lassalle, who became disappointed in the 
newspaper, wrote to Marx as follows: 'The Volks-Zeitung, the only halfway 
democratic newspaper in Berlin, has rushed over to the ministerial camp and 
plays a role unique for its unworthiness in the history of the democratic 
press.'—396 
382 In this letter, written at the end of February 1859, Lassalle informed Marx that 
he had reached an agreement with Franz Duncker regarding the publication of 
Engels' Po and Rhine. He stated the terms and suggested that the pamphlet 
should be published in French translation too.—398 
383 In his speech in the Frankfurt National Assembly on 12 August 1848 General 
Radowitz asserted that Austria's boundary along the Mincio (in other words, 
continued Austrian rule in Northern Italy) guaranteed Germany against French 
invasion. This doctrine was refuted in Engels' pamphlet Po and Rhine and in 
Marx's article 'The War Prospect in Prussia' (see present edition, Vol. 16, 
pp. 216, 235 and 270).—398 
384 A reference to the national liberation and anti-feudal uprising in the city of 
Cracow, which had been under the joint control of Austria, Russia and Prussia 
from 1815. The insurgents seized power on 22 February 1846 and pet up a 
National Government, which issued a manifesto abolishing feudal services. The 

=====第661页=====
Notes 627 
uprising was put down in early March 1846. In November 1846, Austria, 
Prussia and Russia signed a treaty incorporating Cracow in the Austrian 
Empire.—401 
385 Further events showed that Marx's forecast was true. In April 1859 the British 
Parliament was dissolved and new elections in June 1859 brought to power 
a government headed by Palmerston, who had been in opposition until then. 
The ideas expressed by Marx in this and other letters of that period 
concerning the situation in Europe in view of the maturing military crisis, were 
developed in his article 'The War Prospect in France' written for the New-York 
Daily Tribune (see present edition, Vol.  16).—401,  405, 429 
386 Engels means one of the three annual fairs in Leipzig, the spring fair, at which 
all German publishing houses used to exhibit their books.—402 
387 After a long imprisonment, the Italian liberal Carlo Poerio and his associates, 
participants in the 1848-49 revolution, were expelled by the Neapolitan 
authorities and placed on a ship bound for America. On the way, the captain 
set diem free at a British port. On 12 March 1859 The Times (No. 23252) 
published a letter to the editor by Lord Shaftesbury hailing Poerio and his 
friends as 'honest and heroic men'. To support them a committee was set up in 
London with Lord Shaftesbury as President. Palmerston, too, was a member.— 
405 
388 The letter is not dated. The time of its writing is clear from the enclosed letter 
of Eccarius to Marx, written on 20 March 1859, and from Marx mentioning his 
article on the Reform Bill, which was presumably sent to New York on 22 
March, Tuesday, one of the two weekdays when articles were despatched to 
America.—406 
389 Besides 'The New British Reform Bill' (see present edition, Vol. 16), Marx 
wrote two more articles on the 1859 Reform Bill, on 22 March and 1 April 
1859,  but they were not published in the New-York Daily Tribune and have not 
reached us.—406, 411 
390 Marx has in mind cases when the New-York Daily Tribune reprinted articles 
from the London Times.—406 
391 From 1693 to 1806 Wetzlar was the seat of the Reichskammergeriecht (Imperial 
Court of Justice) which examined disputes between the lands, complaints 
connected with taxation, and other questions. It was also the highest court of 
appeal for the lands and cities comprising the Holy Roman Empire of the 
German Nation. It was notorious for procrastination and red tape.—408 
392 Marx means the new proposal Max Friedländer had made to him in the course 
of negotiations on Marx's work for the Vienna newspaper Die Presse (see also 
Note 254). It was forwarded to him by Lassalle in a letter written at the end of 
March 1859, and Marx's letter is the reply to it. This time Friedländer did not 
stipulate that Marx should abstain from criticising Palmerston and proposed 
that, besides articles, Marx should send telegraphic despatches on current 
events. In his letter Lassalle also asked Marx for advice concerning his own 
work for the paper. Marx wrote about the negotiations also in.his letter to.

Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy and offered his help in selling 
50-100 copies of the German edition of the book in America. Dana also 
requested Marx to write articles on 'Fortification' and 'Infantry' for The New 
American Cyclopaedia. Both articles were written by Engels (see present edition, 
Vol. 18).—410 
394 In 1852 the Tory government of Derby was brought down by the Free Traders 
led by Bright, and Palmerston became Home Secretary in the new coalition 
government of Aberdeen. The fall of the Aberdeen government in 1855, 
caused by setbacks in the Crimean War, cost Russell the post of Foreign 
Secretary, while Palmerston headed the new, Whig government. During the 
second Derby ministry (1858-59), opposition by Bright and Russell contributed 
to the government's resignation, clearing the field for Palmerston's second 
cabinet.—411 
S95 On 31 March 1859 the House of Commons rejected, after a second reading, 
the Reform Bill proposed by the Tory government of Derby-Disraeli, which led 
to the government's fall. In the preceding debate, on 24 March, Bright and 
Gibson spoke against the Bill. Gibson quoted Bright, who said in one of his 
earlier speeches that 'there was no Bill so revolutionary as a bad Bill'. While 
favouring the preservation of some elements of the obsolete system |of 'rotten 
boroughs', Gibson opposed the new distribution of electoral districts! proposed 
by the government. j 
The ideas expressed in this letter were probably discussed in greater detail 
in Marx's article on the Reform Bill written on 1 April 1859, which was not 
published by the New-York Daily Tribune editors.—411

398 while a member of the House of Commons, Thomas Chisholm Anstey, 
together with David Urquhart, repeatedly criticised Palmerston's foreign policy. 
As Attorney-General of Hong Kong in 1854-58, he came out against corruption 
and abuses by the British colonial administration, for which he was virtually 
removed from office. Upon his return to England in 1859, The Times printed, 
on 9 April, a statement by M.P. Edwin James announcing his intention to 
publish documents bearing on Anstey's dismissal.—412 
399 Marx refers to the India Loan Bill introduced in the British House of 
Commons on 14 February 1859 by Secretary of State for the Affairs of India 
Stanley. The loan of £7,000,000 was required to cover the extra expenses of 
the British administration in India. Marx wrote about the Bill and India's 
financial position in general in his article 'Great Trouble in Indian Finances' 
(present edition, Vol. 16).—413 
400 Marx means the Shanghai Anglo-Chinese trade agreement of 8 November 
1858,  which supplemented the Tientsin Anglo-Chinese Treaty of 1858. It 
established general rules of trade and listed goods free from export and import 
duties (articles of consumption intended for foreigners) and those subject to 
duties. The import of opium into China was formally allowed only in the form 
of foreign medicine which, however, was tantamount to the legalisation of the 
opium trade, though on a restricted scale.—413 
401 On 5 April 1859 the New-York Daily Tribune, No. 5602, printed a reader's letter 
signed 'Asboth' with comments on Engels' article 'Chances of the Impending

War' (see present edition, Vol. 16). The author referred to an earlier letter of 
his, about Engels' article 'The Austrian Hold on Italy' (see Vol. 16). That other 
letter, signed 'A', appeared in the Tribune, No. 5581, on 11 March 1859 (in 
Asbôth's second letter the date was given incorrectly as '14th inst'). The later 
letter largely repeated the first. Asbôth considered die assessment of Austria's 
possibilities in the impending war given by Engels in his two articles 
insufficiently thorough and exaggerated.—417 
402 In a letter which has not reached us, Engels may have informed Marx of a 
review of American newspapers published in a supplement to the Allgemeine 
Zeitung, No. 102, on 12 April 1859. Much space in the review was devoted to 
the New-York Daily Tribune which, in the words of the author, had published 'a 
number of interesting military-scientific articles on the North Italian theatre of 
war'. The review stressed that the Tribune editors were strongly influenced by the 
ideas of German revolutionaries.—417 
403 Marx wrote this letter in reply to one from Lassalle of 8 April 1859. In his 
letter Lassalle forwarded a postal order to Marx, informed him of the 
publication of Engels' pamphlet Po and Rhine and asked for Marx's opinion on 
his drama Franz von Sickingen. He had sent Marx tihree copies of his drama (for 
Marx, Engels and Freiligrath) on 6 March 1859, together with a note 
explaining the 'tragic idea' of the drama. The aesthetic principles formulated in 
the note and in the preface to Sickingen, and embodied in the drama, were at 
variance with the demands Marx and Engels made upon realistic art, namely, 
truuSfully to depict in the idiom specific to it the concrete reality of a definite 
social environment at a given period of history. Lassalle saw the essence of 
drama in the tragic conflict of the hero—the bearer of a certain abstract idea, 
in this case a revolutionary one—with the masses, who are incapable of 
grasping this idea in an adequate form owing to their backwardness and 
ignorance. This compells the hero to deviate from his ideals in practice and 
resort to 'cunning' (Pfiffigkeit), and ultimately dooms him to defeat. 
In his reply Marx gave a critical analysis of Sickingen from a dialectical-
materialist standpoint and, in effect, argued against Lassalle's principles and the 
political tendency of the drama. 
In English this letter was published, abridged, in Marx and Engels, 
Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1955, 
and in full in The Letters of Karl Marx, selected and translated with explanatory 
notes and an introduction by Saul K. Padover, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood 
Cliff,  New Jersey, 1979.—418 
404 This refers to the Polish national liberation uprising of November 1830-
October 1831. Its participants belonged mostly to the revolutionary gentry, and 
its leaders to the aristocracy. The uprising was crushed by Tsarist Russia aided 
by Prussia and Austria. Lack of support by the peasants, due to the leaders' 
refusal to abolish serfdom, contributed to its defeat. See also Engels' speech 'On 
the Polish Question' (present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 549-52), and his The Peasant 
War in Germany, where he writes about the failure of the nobility to win over 
the peasants in Germany in 1522 and in Poland in 1830 (Vol. 10, p. 444).—420 
405 This refers to the withdrawal of the French troops that had occupied Rome 
during the suppression of the Roman Republic in 1849 and stayed on in 
subsequent years, as did the Austrians, who in 1849 had occupied the territory 
of the Legations, Marke and part of Umbria, belonging to the Roman 
Republic—425

406 At a reception of the diplomatic corps in the Tuileries on 1 January 1859, 
Napoleon III said to the Austrian Ambassador J. A. Hübner: 'I regret that our 
relations with your Government are not as good as formerly.' This statement 
led to a diplomatic conflict with Austria, war against which had been decided 
on much earlier: in July 1858, in Plombières, a secret agreement had been 
reached between France and Piedmont, under which France was promised 
Savoy and Nice in exchange for participation in the forthcoming war against 
Austria.—425 
407 A reference to the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna held by European 
monarchs in 1814-15. Signed on 9 June 1815, it laid down the frontiers of 
European states and their regimes—based on the principle of legitimism—as 
decreed by the victor powers. The Final Act sealed the political fragmentation 
of Germany and Italy.—426 
408 Marx refers to the ultimatum the Austrian government presented to Piedmont 
on 19 April 1859 in a letter by Count K. Buol-Schauenstein, Austria's Foreign 
Minister, to Count Cavour, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Piedmont 
(published in the Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 116, supplement, 26 April 1859). It 
demanded that Piedmont should disarm within three days and disband the 
detachments of Italian volunteers. Refusal to comply with these demands would 
be regarded as a casus belli. On 29 April the Austrian army under Field 
Marshal Gyulay crossed the frontier river Ticino, thus starting the Austro-Italo-
French war of 1859.—427 
409 Louis Auguste Blanqui was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for his part in 
the 1848 revolution. In the spring of 1859, having served his term in Belle-Ile 
and Corsica, he was deported to Algeria. Following the amnesty of 16 August 
1859,  he returned to Paris.—427 
410 Ridiculing Karl Vogt, Marx often puns on his name. Vogt or Landvogt was the 
name of provincial governors or other officials in the German Empire in the 
Middle Ages. 
By calling him 'the great imperial Vogt', Marx alludes to the fact that he 
was one of the five members of the Regency of the Empire (Reichsregentschaft) 
formed in Stuttgart in early June 1849 by the 'Rump' of the Frankfurt National 
Assembly. The Regency's attempts to enforce die Imperial Constitution (see 
Note 116) by parliamentary means ended in failure.—428, 434, 436, 450, 460, 
488,  521 
411 Vogt and his followers intended to publish a weekly, Die Neue Schweiz, in 
Geneva. Later that title was dropped in favour of Neue Schweizer Zeitung. 
On Vogt's letter to Freiligrath and the 'Programme' appended to it see 
Marx's exposé Herr Vogt (present edition, Vol. 17, p. 115).—428 
412 Marx alludes to Blind's call for the union of 'the leaders of all German popular 
parties' contained in his article published in the Hermann on 16 April 1859. 
According to Blind, this was to put an end to the confusion of opinions on the 
Italian crisis. Blind himself pronounced against both the pro-Austrian and 
pro-Bonapartist stand in this article.—428 
41S Marx's reply to Friedländer's letter of 12 April 1859 has not been found.—429, 
433 
414 The New-York Daily Tribune did not publish this article by Engels, which 
presumably dealt with the Austro-Italo-French war, then in its early days.—430

Notes 631 
415 The reference is to the secret Paris treaty of 19 February (3 March) 1859 
concluded between France and Russia. Russia undertook to adopt a 'political 
and military stand which most easily proves its favourable neutrality towards 
France' and not to object to the enlargement of the Kingdom of Sardinia in the 
event of a war between France and Sardinia on the one hand and Austria on 
the other. Information about this secret treaty leaked into the press but the 
Russian Foreign Minister Gorchakov officially denied the existence of any 
written obligations to France. Marx refers to this treaty in his article 'The 
Financial Panic' (present edition, Vol. 16).—430, 537 
416 The Holy Alliance—an association of European monarchs founded in 
September 1815, on the initiative of the Russian Tsar Alexander I and the 
Austrian Chancellor Metternich, to suppress revolutionary movements and 
preserve feudal monarchies in European countries. During the 1848-49 
revolution and subsequent years, counter-revolutionary circles in Austria, 
Prussia and Tsarist Russia attempted to revive the Holy Alliance in a modified 
form.—430 
417 Marx refers to the commercial panic in Vienna started by the bankruptcy on 5 
May 1859 of the big firm of Arnstein & Eskeles. Marx deals in detail with this 
subject in the article 'Highly Important from Vienna' (present edition, 
Vol. 16).—433 
418 A reference to Lassalle's undated letter to Marx written in all probability in 
mid-May 1859. Marx discusses it in this letter and in one to Engels dated 18 
May 1859.—433, 434 
419 Marx compares the commercial panic in Vienna in the spring of 1859 (see Note 
417) to that in Hamburg during the economic crisis in the autumn of 
1857.—434 
420 On 9 May 1859 Marx, while attending a public meeting organised by Urquhart 
in connection with the Italian war, was told by the German democrat Karl 
Blind that Vogt was in receipt of subsidies from the French government for 
Bonapartist propaganda and had offered bribes to some writers to induce them 
to come out in support of Napoleon III (see present edition, Vol. 17, 
pp. 116-17).—434, 436, 460, 468, 533, 539, 543 
421 In his anonymous pamphlet Der italienische Krieg und die Aufgabe Preußens. Eine 
Stimme aus der Demokratie, published in May 1859, Lassalle advocated the 
dynastic unification of Germany under the aegis of the Prussian monarchy, as 
against the idea of Germany's unification as a democratic republic put forward 
by Marx and Engels in 1848. Lassalle also tried to justify the neutrality of 
Prussia and other German states in the Austro-Italo-French war of 1859, an 
attitude which, he argued, contributed to the weakening of Austria, Prussia's 
rival, and the establishment of Prussian hegemony. At the same time he 
justified the policy of Napoleon III, in particular his demagogy on the 
nationalities question (the so-called principle of nationalities), and hailed the 
Bonapartist Second Empire as the potential 'liberator' of Italy.—435 
422 Marx uses Lassalle's words here. In a letter to him Lassalle described his work 
on the pamphlet about the Italian war as follows: 'In the last few days, writing 
nights through, I have tried to weave from logic and fire something ... which 
will not be lost on -the people in any case..."—436, 458 
423 The Federal Diet—a representative body of the German Confederation, an 
ephemeral union of German states, founded in 1815 by decision of the

Congress of Vienna. Though it had no real power, it was nevertheless a vehicle 
for feudal and monarchical reaction. During the 1848-49 revolution in 
Germany, reactionary circles made vain attempts to revive the Federal Diet, 
intending to use it to prevent the democratic unification of Germany. After the 
defeat of the revolution, the Federal Diet received its former rights in 1850 and 
survived till 1866.—436 
424 fhe Peace of Basle was concluded on 5 April 1795 separately between France 
and Prussia, the latter being a member of the first anti-French coalition. The 
treaty was the consequence of the French victories as well as of the differences 
between the members of the coalition, in particular between Prussia and 
Austria.—437 
425 No manifesto was issued.—437, 447, 449 
426 Marx refers to the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 
50).—437 
427 -T/ne International Committee was set up in London on 25 January 1855 on the 
initiative of Ernest Jones. On 6 May 1856 it was renamed the International 
Association. It included English Chartists and French, German, Polish, Italian, 
Hungarian, Spanish and Russian political refugees in London. The Associa­
tion's political and ideological heterogeneity hampered the performance of its 
main function, promotion of the international cooperation of democratic 
forces. The Association ceased to exist in 1859.—437 
428 xhe last two issues of the weekly Die Neue Zeit —Nos. 41 and 42 of 10 and 16 
April 1859—had only two pages instead of the usual four. It was one of these 
issues that Marx sent Engels. 
The meeting mentioned by Marx was held at the London hotel Germania 
on 1 May 1859 on Liebknecht's initiative. Attended by members of German 
workers' societies in London, it decided to start publication of Das Volk, a 
weekly representing the views and interests of the German workers in 
Britain.—437 
429 Early in October 1856 the Marx family moved to a London suburb.—438, 464 
430 Das Volk —a German-language weekly published in London from 7 May to 20 
August 1859—was founded as the official organ of the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London. Its first issue appeared under the editorship of 
the German journalist and petty-bourgeois democrat Elard Biskamp. Beginning 
with issue No. 2 Marx took an active part in its publication: he offered advice, 
edited articles, organised material support, and so on. In issue No. 6 of 11 
June,  the Editorial Board officially named Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, 
Ferdinand Freiligrath, Wilhelm Wolff and Heinrich Heise as its contributors 
(see present edition, Vol. 16). 
Marx's first article in the paper—'Spree and Mincio'—was printed on 25 
June.  Under Marx's influence Das Volk began to turn into a militant 
revolutionary working-class newspaper. In the beginning of July Marx became 
its virtual editor and manager. 
Das Volk carried Marx's preface to his work A Contribution to the Critique of 
Political Economy, six of his articles, seven articles by Engels and his review of 
Marx's A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. 
Das Volk reflected the elaboration by Marx and Engels of questions 
concerning the revolutionary theory and tactics of the working-class struggle, 
described the class struggles of the proletariat, and relendessly fought the

exponents of petty-bourgeois ideology. It analysed from the standpoint of 
proletarian internationalism the events of the Austro-Italo-French war of 1859 
and the questions of German and Italian unification, exposed the foreign policy 
of Britain, Prussia, France, Russia and other states, and consistendy opposed 
Bonapartism and its overt and covert supporters. 
In all, sixteen issues appeared. The newspaper ceased publication for lack 
of money.—438, 447 
431 This refers to a branch of the German Workers' Educational Society in London 
and to an association, close to it, formed by German refugee workers in 
London's East End in November 1858.—440 
432 In his letter of 24 April 1859 from New York, Albrecht Komp told Marx that 
there were favourable opportunities for selling copies of the first instalment of 
his book, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, in die USA. Enclosed 
was a Jetter from Joseph Weydemeyer of 27 March 1859 confirming Komp's 
information.—440, 446, 454 
433 On 21 March 1859 Lassalle wrote to Engels telling him that he had sent copies 
of his drama Franz von Sickingen to England for him, Marx and Freiligrath. In 
this connection Lassalle referred to his letter to Marx of 6 March where he had 
explained his motives for writing the drama, and the aesthetic principles 
underlying it. He probably meant the note—appended to that letter—in which 
he elucidated his concept of the 'tragic idea' (see Note 403). 
This letter of Engels', with the critical analysis of Lassalle's play, continued 
the polemic, started by Marx in his letter to Lassalle of 19 April 1859 (see this 
volume, pp. 418-21), on the evaluation of the historical events and characters 
presented in the drama, on its political message and on problems of aesthetics and 
art. 
On the first English publication of Engels' letter see Note 100.—441 
434 In early 1858 Lassalle published anonymously a stage version of his drama 
Franz von Sickingen. But when the Royal Court Theatre refused to put it on, 
Lassalle published it as a literary drama (at die beginning of 1859).—442 
435 Here and below Engels refers to ideas Lassalle put forward in the preface to 
his Franz von Sickingen. Engels argues against them in one form or 
another.—442 
436 Engels refers to the trial of Lassalle on 3-4 May 1849. He was arrested in 
Düsseldorf on 22 November 1848 on a charge of inciting people to offer 
armed resistance to the government in his speech at a popular meeting in 
Neuss (near Düsseldorf). The proceedings against him were delayed by the 
legal authorities in every possible way. At Lassalle's request, expressed in his 
letters to Marx and Engels, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung came out in defence of 
him and of other persecuted Düsseldorf democrats (see present edition, Vol. 8, 
pp. 344-46, 463-65, 474-76; Vol. 9, pp.  339-41,  377-78, 383-88). Marx and 
Engels also took part in the efforts of democratic organisations to speed up the 
investigation. The jury acquitted Lassalle. —442 
437 Engels calls the leader of the peasant movement of the early 16th century an 
"agitator" (Wühler), the name moderate constitutionalists in Germany in 
1848-49 applied to republican democrats.—444 
438 xhe Bundschuh and the Poor Konrad were secret peasant associations whose 
activities prepared the Peasant War in Germany in 1525 (see Engels' The Peasant

War in Germany, present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 431-38, 440 and 441).— 
445 
439 A reference to the German Republicans and petty-bourgeois democrats, the 
names of whose leaders occur in the refrain of a song popular in South 
Germany during the 1848-49 revolution: 
'Hecker, Struve, Blenker, Zitz und Blum, 
Bringt die deutschen Fürsten um!' 
('Hecker, Struve, Blenker, Zitz and Blum, 
Slay the German princes!'). 
With these lines Engels opens his work The Campaign for the German Imperial 
Constitution, in which he criticises the petty-bourgeois democrats' attitude during 
the revolution (see present edition, Vol. 10, p. 149).—446 
440 TJK Free Press, No. 5, of 27 May 1859 carried Karl Blind's anonymous note 
'The Grand Duke Constantine to Be King of Hungary' exposing the plans for 
giving the Hungarian throne to the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia. Marx 
mentioned this article in his Herr Vogt (see Vol. 17, pp. 122-24). Blind also 
hinted at the possibility of some refugee German democrats and liberals being 
bribed by the Bonapartists. 
The same issue of the journal carried an excerpt from a private letter 
comparing Kossuth's tendency to yield to Bonapartist demagogy in the 
nationalities question with Mazzini's critical attitude to it. Marx may have drawn 
on the two items for the facts he relates to Engels. —452, 504, 521 
441 This refers to the proclamation which Garibaldi addressed to the local 
population upon the entry of his volunteer corps into Lombardy in May 1859 
(see 'Garibaldi's Proclamation to the Lombards', The Times, No. 23319, 30 May 
1859).—455 
442 The reference is probably to the workers' demonstrations for better living 
conditions held in Berlin on 1 and 4 June 1859. Some of the participants were 
arrested.—458 
443 On 14 May 1859 Das Volk (issue No. 2) announced the publication of the 
pamphlet Po and Rhine. On Marx's initiative, the announcement suggested that 
the author of the pamphlet was a prominent member of the proletarian party. 
In its issue No. 5 of 4 June Das Volk carried an editorial on the publication of 
Marx's A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. It contained extracts 
from the Preface to the book and for the first time named Engels as the 
author of Po and Rhine.—458 
444 Marx came to Engels in Manchester approximately on 12 June 1859 to discuss 
questions connected with the publication of Das Volk. From Manchester he 
went to Scotland to visit former members of the Communist League Peter 
Imandt and Heinrich Heise, with whom he discussed the financing of the 
paper. Marx returned to London about 2 July.—459, 462, 470, 472, 497, 520, 
538 
445 This refers to Lassalle's letter to Marx and Engels of 27 May 1859, in which he 
replied to the criticism of his drama Franz von Sickingen contained in Marx's 
letter of 19 April and Engels' letter of 18 May 1859 (see this volume, 
pp. 418-21 and 441-46). In essence Lassalle argued against Marx's and Engels' 
view of the principles of drama and artistic création and'against their conception 
of the historical events presented in his drama. Lassalle tried to justify his attempts 
to glorify the German nobility and play down the historical role of peasant

Notes 635 
uprisings, describing the peasantry as class with reactionary tendencies, and 
Thomas Münzer, the ideologist of the plebeian peasant masses, as a religious 
fanatic—460, 461 
446 Marx and Engels refrained from openly attacking Lassalle's pamphlet in the 
press.  However, indirect polemic against him could be found in their 
newspaper articles, in Engels' pamphlet Savoy, Nice and the Rhine and in Marx's 
Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vols. 16 and 17). It concerned the appraisal of 
the Austro-Italo-French war of 1859, the policy of the ruling classes of France 
and Prussia and the ways of unifying Italy and Germany.—462 
447 Marx did not have to issue a public statement because his book, A Contribution 
to the Critique of Political Economy (see present edition, Vol. 30), had appeared, 
as he soon learned, on 11 June 1859.—463 
448 Marx means the first week after his return to London. He came back about 2 
July 1859 (see Note 444).—463 
449 Das Volk regularly published 'Gatherings from the Press', a column with 
quotations from and critical comments on Kinkel's weekly Hermann. Besides 
Marx, Elard Biskamp took part in writing it (see present edition, Vol. 16, 
pp. 625-34). Marx's biting 'Gatherings' forced Kinkel to resign from the editorial 
board of the weekly. He announced his resignation in the Hermann, No. 26, 2 July 
1859.—463,  468 
450 On 8 July 1859 the emperors of France and Austria held a separate 
meeting—without the King of Piedmont—in Villafranca, at which they 
reached an agreement on an armistice. The meeting was initiated by 
Napoleon III, who feared that the protracted war might give a fresh impulse to 
the revolutionary and national liberation movements in Italy and other 
European states. On 11 July France and Austria signed a preliminary peace 
under which Austria was to cede to France its rights to Lombardy and France 
was to transfer this territory to Piedmont. Venice was to remain under the 
supreme power of Austria, and the rulers of the states of Central Italy were to 
be restored to their thrones. It was intended to create a confederation of Italian 
states under the honorary chairmanship of the Pope. 
The Villafranca preliminaries formed the basis of the peace treaty 
concluded by France, Austria and^ Piedmont in Zurich on 10 November 
1859.—464, 465 
451 Presumably an allusion to Lassalle's letter to Marx and Engels of 27 May 1859 
(see Note 445), in which he asserted that 'a collision ... that constantly recurred in 
all or almost all the past revolutions, and is bound to recur in future ones, is 
the tragic collision of the revolutionary situation itself.—465 
452 In publishing the 'Memoir on Russia' on 13 July 1859 the editors of The Free 
Press wrote that the document had been discovered during the 'Prussian 
ministerial crisis'. This put Engels on his guard and made him, like Marx (see 
his letter to Engels of 19 July 1859, this volume, p. 470), doubt the authenticity 
of some of the passages. 
And indeed, from subsequent issues of The Free Press (of 27 and 31 July 
1859) it appeared that the publication was based not on the original document 
but on material published in the German conservative newspaper Preussisches 
Wochenblatt zur Besprechung politischer Tagesfragen, Nos. 23, 24 and 25, June 9, 
16 and 23, 1855. This publication quoted neither the source from which the 
document had been taken nor its title or the full text. Later Bismarck in his 

=====第670页=====
636 Notes 
memoirs (Gedanken und Erinnerungen, Stuttgart, 1898, Bd. 1, S. 111-112) stated 
outright that the publication had been a forgery. 
Though Marx and Engels were sceptical about the document, they did not 
know that it was completely false. Therefore Marx had it reprinted, from The 
Free Press, in the New-York Daily Tribune (early August) and in Das Volk (late 
July-early August 1859) prefacing it with an 'Introductory Note' (see present 
edition, Vol. 16, p. 415).—468, 470, 476 
453 The 'Memoir on Russia, for the Instruction of the Present Emperor', published 
in The Free Press, said that Russia's interests demanded the murder of Prince 
Alexei (son of Peter I) and Peter of Holstein, i. e., Peter III.—469 
454 Marx means his series of articles "Quid pro Quo", which he began publishing 
in Das Volk (see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 445-64). The series remained 
unfinished as the newspaper ceased publication. In the published instalments 
the 'Memoir on Russia' was not dealt with.—470 
455 The letter has no date. It was written in reply to Marx's letter of 19 July 1859 
(this volume, pp. 469-71) and answered by Marx on 22 July (pp. 472-74). So 
the letter must have been written between these dates.—471 
456 Engels' letter to Duncker has not been found.—474 
457 From late June to 20 August 1859 Das Volk published a series of articles 
entitled 'Feierstunden-Arbeit eines Arbeiters' ('Spare-Time Work of a Worker'). 
The author advocated schools for workers and disparaged the bourgeois 
phrases about the sanctity of private property, the need for forgiveness and 
conciliation with one's enemies. 
The earlier instalments appeared unsigned but the last three were marked 
by the letter 'P'. The series was written by the Danish refugee N. Petersen.— 
476 
458 In its 'Feuilleton' column, Das Volk, No. 13, 30 July 1859, carried a poem by a 
Landwehr soldier from Frankfort on the Oder describing the mechanism of the 
needle gun. The editors supplied it with ironical comments.—477 
459 Early in May 1851 Peter Nothjung was sent on a tour of Germany as an 
emissary of the Cologne Central Committee of the Communist League. On 
10 May he was arrested in Leipzig. The documents seized from him enabled 
the authorities of Prussia and other German states to arrest more League 
members.—478 
460 Crawshay's letter, published in The Free Press, No. 8, 27 July 1859, stated that 
die 'Russian Memoir' had been published in 1855 in a German newspaper (it 
was the Preussisches Wochenblatt zur Besprechung politischer Tagesfragen —see Note 
452) and that it had been translated for The Free Press by 'a German'. The 
letter gave no indication as to the identity of that 'German'.—479 
461 About the middle of July 1859 Marx talked with Blind, Liebknecht and 
Hollinger, die owner of the print-shop in which Das Volk was printed, about 
the anti-Vogt anonymous pamphlet Zur Warnung (A Warning) which had been 
reprinted in Das Volk, No. 7, 18 June and the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung, 
No. 173, 22 June. The pamphlet exposed Vogt as a bribed Bonapartist agent. 
During the conversation, Marx gave it as his opinion that the pamphlet had 
been written by Blind as it contained facts which the latter had related to him 
at a public meeting on 9 May 1859 (see Note 420); Marx also pointed out that 
the proofs of the pamphlet, discovered by Liebknecht in Hollinger's print-shop

in mid-June and sent by him to the Allgemeine Zeitung contained corrections in 
Blind's handwriting. However, Blind, unwilling openly to attack Vogt, denied 
his authorship. His attitude was later condemned by Marx in his polemi­
cal work Herr Vogt (present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 122-32).—479, 486, 498. 
503, 539 
462 The project to publish the Union Républicaine did not materialise. So 
this volume, p. 484.—480 
463 Engels means Duncker's letter of 3 August 1859, which was in reply to Engels' 
letter, no longer extant, of 25 July. Duncker wrote that he had sent six copies 
of Engels' pamphlet Po and Rhine, and would advertise Marx's A Contribution to 
the Critique of Political Economy in German papers several weeks after its 
publication because, he maintained, this would make for better sales.—481 
464 The Urquhartite Free Press had been suggesting that Mazzini was a 'Russian 
agent'. This idea had been expressed, in particular, in the note 'Kossuth and 
Mazzini' published in The Free Press, No. 5, 27 May 1859. 
By Mazzini's 'diplomatic revelations' Engels means his assertions in The 
Times (No.  23381,  10 August 1859) about the existence of a secret agreement 
between Bonapartist France, Tsarist Russia and the Austrian Empire on 
combating national liberation movements in Europe.—482 
465 Marx means the Union Républicaine, which was to be published by Ledru-Rollin 
and Louis Blanc (see this volume, p. 480). 
Napoleon Ill's amnesty for political offenders (16 August 1859) was to 
ensure his government the support of liberal circles.—484 
466 The letter is not dated. The time of its writing may be established by reference 
to Marx's mentioning his article about Italy and Hungary. He probably means the 
article 'Kossuth and Louis Napoleon' published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 
24 September (No. 5748) and dated 5 September 1859. It is quite possible that 
Marx sent Engels the letter on the same day.—485 
46V i^e letter is not dated. But since it was in reply to Marx's letter presumably 
written on 5 September 1859 (see Note 466), the time of its writing can be 
approximately established by comparing the two letters. Marx asked Engels to 
send him by Friday (i. e., 9 September) 'a military piece on China' (probably in 
connection with the resumption of the Western powers' second Opium War 
against China). Being unable to supply the article by the appointed day, Engels 
informed Marx of this on the eve, i. e., on 8 September.—486 
468 Blind's letter to Liebknecht of 8 September 1859 is quoted in full in Marx's 
Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 122).—486 
469 Marx means the written declaration given to him on 17 September 1859 by 
August Vögele, the compositor, testifying that the pamphlet Zur Warnung had 
been set in Fidelio Hollinger's print-shop, that the manuscript was in Blind's 
hand and that Hollinger had named Blind as the author of the pamphlet (see 
present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 123, 124-25 and 319).—488, 498 
470 On 22 June 1859 the Allgemeine Zeitung reprinted the pamphlet Zur Warnung, 
which induced Vogt, in July, to bring an action for libel against the paper. The 
case was heard on 24 October 1859. In early August the editors of the 
Allgemeine Zeitung had asked Liebknecht for proof of the accusations against 
Vogt contained in Zur Warnung. Liebknecht requested Marx to help him obtain 
Blind's admission that he, Blind, was the author of the anonymous pamphlet. 
Marx considered such an admission necessary also because Vogt had declared 

=====第672页=====
638 Notes 
Marx to be the author of the pamphlet. Besides, Marx wanted to expose the 
cowardice of this petty-bourgeois democrat who dared not challenge 
Bonaparte's agents openly and was, as it were, aiding and abetting Vogt in his 
dispute with the Allgemeine Zeitung. Though Marx emphatically condemned the 
paper's conservative views, in this case he assisted it in the interests of the 
common struggle against Bonapartism. The court dismissed Vogt's action (see 
present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 111-32, also pp. 3 and 8-9).—488, 503, 507, 514, 
519, 520 
471 Marx refers to the Friends of the Fatherland Society (Vaterlandsfreundegesellschaft) — 
a republican association of German refugees in London that existed in the 
1850s and 60s. Karl Blind, Ferdinand Freiligrath and Fidelio Hollinger were 
among its members.—488 
472 The letter has not been found.—489 
473 After the publication, in June 1859, of the first instalment of A Contribution to 
the Critique of Political Economy (see present edition, Vol. 30), Marx intended, as 
previously agreed with the Berlin publisher Duncker, to prepare for the press 
and publish as the second instalment the 'Chapter on Capital', which constitutes 
the bulk of his main economic manuscript of 1857-58; and then publish the 
remaining parts of his economic work (see Notes 250 and 355). 
As he proceeded with his plan, however, he realised that he would have to 
do more research to formulate the basic propositions of his economic theory. 
But his journalistic activity and other party obligations, above all the need to 
refute publicly Vogt's slanderous allegations against proletarian revolutionaries, 
temporarily diverted him from his economic studies. It was not until 1861 that 
he resumed them in earnest. Later Marx decided to publish his researches not 
as the second and further instalments of A Contribution to the Critique of Political 
Economy but as a large independent work.—489, 498, 502, 508, 511, 522, 523, 
542, 574 
474 The letter has not been found.—489 
475 Marx means Engels' return to Manchester on 20 September 1859, after 
accompanying his parents on a short tour of Scotland (see this volume, 
p. 490).—491 
476 Speculation of this kind probably stemmed from the amnesty for political 
offenders demagogically granted by Napoleon III on 16 August 1859 (see Note 
465) and from the expectations of a similar amnesty in Prussia in connection 
with the forthcoming enthronement of William I.—491 
477 The letter is not dated. It was written in reply to Marx's letter of 23 September 
1859.  Marx answered it, presumably, on 27 September (see Note 480). So this 
letter seems to have been written between these two dates.—492 
478 Marx's letters of 26 September and 8 October 1859 to Bertalan Szemere, the 
former Prime Minister of the Hungarian revolutionary government, is evidence 
of his desire to strengthen contacts with refugee Hungarian revolutionary 
democrats. In the.se  letters Marx criticises Kossuth's attitude in the years of 
emigration, in particular his tendency to take Napoleon Ill's demagogy in the 
nationalities question at face value, and his-illusions concerning the possibility 
of using the French Emperor as an ally in the struggle for Hungary's 
liberation. This criticism docs not extend to Kossuth's activity during the 
1848-49 revolution, when he headed the revolutionary forces fighting for 
Hungary's national independence and, in the words of Engels, was 'a truly

revolutionary figure, a man who in the name of his people dares to accept the 
challenge of a desperate struggle' (Vol. 8, p. 227).—493, 504 
479 On 23 August 1859 the New-York Daily Tribune published an anonymous item 
marked 'From Our Own Correspondent' (written by the Hungarian emigrant 
Ferenc Pulszky) which was an attempt to justify Kossuth's ties with Napoleon 
III. Early in September Marx sent two articles to the paper exposing the ties of 
both Kossuth and his followers, including Pulszky, with Bonapartist circles. The 
facts testifying to Kossuth's dealings with Napoleon III, which Marx cited in the 
two articles were given to him by Bertalan Szemere on 1 September 1859 when 
the latter visited him in London. The Tribune published, on 24 September, one 
article by Marx on the subject, 'Kossuth and Louis Napoleon' (present edition, 
Vol. 16), possibly combining the two he had sent. Whether Marx's private letter 
to the Tribune editor, Charles Dana, was used in it is not known, for the letter 
has not been found. On 28 September the London Free Press published Marx's 
article 'Particulars of Kossuth's Transaction with Louis Napoleon', which was a 
condensed version of the Tribune article.—494, 497, 507, 525 
480 -phe letter has no date. The approximate date of its writing has been deduced 
from Marx's acknowledgment of the money Engels sent him in a letter written 
between 24 and 26 September (see Nöte 477), and from the fact that Marx 
wrote it on an 'article day', i. e., a day when he sent material to the New-York 
Daily Tribune. In this case it was, most likely, Tuesday, 27 September. It has 
also been taken into account that this letter preceded the one Marx wrote to 
Engels on 28 September 1859.—495 
481 The letter is not dated. It is the reply to Lassalle's letter of 30 September 1859. 
In sending the latter on to Engels on 5 October 1859, Marx wrote that he had 
answered it 'by return' (see this volume, p. 502). Taking into account the time 
letters took to get from Berlin to London, it may be assumed that Marx 
received Lassalle's not earlier than 2 October. 
On the first English publication of Marx's letter see Note 20.—497 
482 The article 'The New Portfolio' published in The Free Press, No. 9, 31 August 
1859 reported the forthcoming publication in Berlin of a collection of 
diplomatic documents and materials corresponding to the Portfolio series 
published by David Urquhart in London (see Note 18). The German series, 
edited by Eduard Fischel, appeared in Berlin in 1859-60 under the title Das 
Neue Portfolio. Eine Sammlung wichtiger Dokumente und Aktenstücke zur Zeitge­
schichte. The above-mentioned article also said that the 'Memoir on Russia' 
first appeared, in German, in the Preussisches Wochenblatt and that the publica­
tion in The Free Press was a translation from the German (see Note 452).— 
500, 547 
483 Marx means the lectures on political economy he gave in the German Workers' 
Educational Society in London in the autumn of 1859, after the publication of 
his A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. The draft of one of the 
lectures has been published in the present edition under the title 'On the 
Division of Labour' (Vol. 16, pp. 617-18).—502, 520 
484 This communication has not been found.—503 
485 In a letter to Marx written in October 1859 Lassalle again tried to prove the 
correctness of the tactics he had advocated in his pamphlet Der italienische Krieg 
und die Aufgabe Preußens (see Note 421). Marx replied to him on 22 November,

640 Notes 
supplementing his criticism of Lassalle's anti-proletarian, pro-Bonapartist 
position on this question with fresh arguments (see this volume, 
pp. 536-39).—508, 522 
486 Marx refers to the festivities to mark the centenary of Schiller's birth on 10 
November 1859. The preparations in London were handled by a jubilee 
committee consisting of petty-bourgeois refugees headed by Gottfried Kinkel, 
who hoped to use the festival for his own publicity purposes.—508, 511, 514, 
525 
487 This refers to August Vögele's written declaration (see Note 469), which Marx 
sent to the editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung on 19 October 1859 in connection 
with Vogt's law-suit against the paper (see Note 470).—508, 513, 515, 521 
488 Marx's letter to Ferdinand Freiligrath has not been found.—511 
489 Engels seems to refer to the planned march of Romagnese and Tuscan 
volunteers under Garibaldi to Central and South Italy with a .view to 
reactivating die struggle for Italy's unification. The plan had been put forward 
by Italy's democrats headed by Mazzini, who were not satisfied with the 
Villafranca treaty (see Note 370). The march was to take place in late October 
or early November 1859. 
Victor Emmanuel, King of Sardinia, and his liberal following at first sought 
to exploit Garibaldi for the unification of Italy under the aegis of the Sardinian 
dynasty, but fearing an outbreak of popular unrest in Central Italy diey 
succeeded in having the expedition cancelled.—515 
490 In the summer of 1859 hostilities resumed in the second Opium War in China 
(1856-60). 
In October 1859 Spain declared war on Morocco and invaded the country. 
This colonial incursion met with stubborn resistance and brought the Spaniards 
no success. The fighting continued until March 1860. In April a peace treaty 
was concluded under which Spain received indemnities and insignificant 
territorial concessions.—515, 523 
491 At the time, Engels was studying the Gothic translation of the Bible made by 
the Visigothic bishop Ulfilas. The extant fragments of Ulfilas' Bible, the main 
written monument of the Gothic language, were available in a number of 
editions prepared by different German scholars.—516 
492 The Schiller society, founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection 
with the centenary of Schiller's birth, was conceived as ä cultural and social 
centre of the city's German colony. At first Engels was critical of the society and 
kept aloof from it. But after certain amendments were made in the Rules, he 
became a member of its board, in 1864, and later President of the society, 
devoting much time to it and exercising a considerable influence on its 
activities.—517, 531 
493 Marx means Lassalle's negotiations with the Berlin publisher Duncker on the 
publication of the second instalment of A Contribution to the Critique of Political 
Economy (see also Note 473).—518 
494 The Communist League—the first German and international communist 
organisation of the proletariat formed under the leadership of Marx and 
Engels in London early in June 1847, as a result of the reorganisation of the 
League of the Just (a secret association of workers and artisans that appeared 
in the 1830s and had communities in Germany, France, Switzerland and 

=====第675页=====
Notes 641 
England). The League's members took an active part in the bourgeois-
democratic revolution in Germany in 1848-49. In 1849 and 1850, after the 
defeat of the revolution, it was reorganised and continued its activities. In the 
summer of 1850 disagreements arose between the supporters of Marx and 
Engels and the sectarian Willich-Schapper group, which resulted in a split 
widiin the League. Owing to police persecutions and arrests of League 
members in May 1851, the activities of the Communist League as 
an organisation practically ceased in Germany. On 17 November 1852, 
on a motion by Marx, the London District announced the dissolution of the 
League. 
The Communist League played an important historical role as the first 
proletarian party based on the principles of scientific communism, as a school 
of proletarian revolutionaries, and as the historical forerunner of the 
International Working Men's Association.—519 
495 Marx refers to the war waged by the mountaineers of Daghestan and Chechnya 
under Shamil against Tsarist Russia. Having defeated Shamil's main forces and 
taken him prisoner (August 1859), the Russians were breaking the resistance of 
separate detachments of Shamil's followers.—523 
496 During the Italian war of 1859 Kossuth was in Italy where, on his initiative, a 
Hungarian legion has been formed to fight against Austria on the side of 
Piedmont and Bonapartist France. He hoped to win independence for 
Hungary with the help of the latter. 
On the Villafranca peace see Note 450.—524, 532 
497 On 26 May 1849 Wilhelm  Wolff,  who shortly before had taken over the seat of 
a moderate deputy in the Frankfurt National Assembly, spoke in the Assembly 
against the adoption of an address to the German people drawn up by die poet 
Uhland in the name of moderate democrats, and proposed declaring the 
Imperial Regent of Germany, Archduke John of Austria, and his ministers 
traitors to the people. His speech was sharply criticised by bourgeois deputies, 
Karl Vogt in particular.—525 
498 Marx puns on die phrase abgerundete Natur ('an intellectually mature character') 
used by barrister K. Hermann, who represented Vogt in his lawsuit against the 
Allgemeine Zeitung (see Note 470). The phrase can also mean 'well-rounded 
character' (in the physical sense), and it is in this sense that Marx later used it 
in his polemical work Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 28).—525 
499 Marx and Engels ridiculed these attributes of Kinkel in their satire The Great 
Men of the Exile (see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 252-55). 
Black, red and gold symbolise the unity of Germany; petty-bourgeois 
democrats associated the colours with the idea of a union of autonomous lands 
in the manner of the Swiss Confederation.—526 
500 The letter is not dated. By its contents it is close to Marx's letter to Engels of 16 
November 1859. Marx's mentioning that he wanted an article about the war in 
Morocco 'by tomorrow', and that he was writing an article about the Suez 
question, 'not having written on Tuesday', suggests that 'tomorrow' means 
Friday (Tuesday and Friday being the days when Marx sent articles to the 
New-York Daily Tribune), and that this letter was written on Thursday, 
17 November.—529 

=====第676页=====
642 Notes 
501 Marx's article about the events connected with the building of the Suez Canal, 
which had aggravated the contradictions between Britain and France, was not 
published by the New-York Daily Tribune.—529 
502 xhe rifle volunteer movement started in Britain at the end of 1850 as a 
reaction to Napoleon Ill's aggressive policy, which was seen as holding the 
threat of a French invasion of the British Isles. Progressive circles believed that 
the movement could also help reform the extremely conservative British 
military system. 
An article by Engels on the volunteer movement in Britain appeared in the 
New-York Daily Tribune later (see F. Engels, 'The British Volunteer Force', 
present edition, Vol. 17). Engels also wrote a series of articles on the subject for 
the Manchester weekly The Volunteer Journal, for Lancashire and Cheshire 
(present edition, Vol. 18).—530, 544, 546 
503 On 10 November 1859 the Crystal Palace (see Note 89) was the scene of 
festivities to mark the centenary of Schiller's birth, with German petty-
bourgeois refugees, above all Kinkel, playing the main  role.—531,  534 
504 xhe cutting from the Volksblatt presumably was a report on Vogt's lawsuit 
against the Allgemeine Zeitung (see Note 470) containing slanderous attacks on 
Marx and his followers.—532 
505 Marx alludes to Batrachomyomachia (The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice), an 
old anonymous Greek parody of Homer's Iliad.—532 
506 xhis letter is the reply to two letters by Lassalle, dated mid-November and 20 
November 1859. Marx reverts to the disagreements with Lassalle over the 
assessment of Napoleon Ill's policy and the tactical line on the question of 
Italy's and Germany's unification, and answers Lassalle's attempts to prove the 
correctness of his stand formulated in a letter written in October 1859 (see 
Note 485).—536 
507 In a letter to Marx written in mid-November 1859 Lassalle praised Freiligrath's 
poem 'Zur Schillerfeier. 10. November 1859. Fesdied der Deutschen in 
London' and at the same time expressed offence at Freiligrath's failing to 
acknowledge his drama Franz von Sickingen, which Lassalle had sent him for 
comment.—537 
508 At the beginning of April 1859 Vogt sent Freiligrath and others his political 
'Programme' calling on the states of the German Confederation to maintain 
neutrality in the war France and Piedmont were preparing against Austria. 
Vogt urged political leaders to support his 'Programme' in the press (see 
present edition, Vol. 17, p. 115).—539, 543 
509 On 19 August 1851 Marx, accompanied by Ferdinand Freiligrath and Wilhelm 
Wolff,  visited the offices of the London German weekly How Do You Do? and 
demanded satisfaction of the publisher Louis Drucker and the editor Heinrich 
Beta, who had printed an item containing insulting allusions to Marx's 
connection with the Prussian Minister of the Interior, Ferdinand von 
Westphalen (Jenny Marx's stepbrother).—540, 545 
510 Marx decided against making his statement (see this volume, p. 535).— 
541 

=====第677页=====
Notes 643 
511 On 15 November 1859 the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung published Freiligrath's 
Statement (see this volume, p. 533) appending to it a note by Gustav Kolb, the 
Editor-in-Chief, claiming that in his letter to the newspaper Liebknecht had 
named Freiligrath among the persons who could come forward with charges 
against Vogt. Actually, Liebknecht had only written that Freiligrath could, 
together with Marx, confirm that Blind was the author of the pamphlet Zur 
Warnung (see Note 461). 
Cotta was the publisher of the Allgemeine Zeitung.— 543 
512 The long letter mentioned by Marx has probably not been preserved. Another 
letter containing the Gartenlaube and Beta's article was sent, most likely, on 19 
November 1859 though that was a Saturday, not a Tuesday (see this volume, 
pp. 532-36).—542 
613 This refers to Lassalle's letter of 20 November 1859, written in reply to Marx's 
letter of 15 November (see this volume, p. 526). In this letter Lassalle tried to 
persuade Marx not to publish his declaration against Vogt and Blind in the 
Volhs-Zeitung (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 8-9).—542 
514 This letter to Freiligrath is quoted in full in Marx's letter to Engels of 10 
December 1859 (see this volume, pp. 548-49) and has come down to us only in 
this form. When reproducing the letter Marx did not date it, but he wrote it, as 
he informed Engels, immediately upon receiving Freiligrath's reply to his letter 
of 23 November. Freiligrath's reply is also quoted in full in the above-
mentioned letter to Engels. Freiligrath, however, had not answered Marx's 
letter at once but, as Marx wrote, had done so after 'having waited a week', 
i. e., on 30 November. Marx's letter to Freiligrath quoted in his letter to Engels 
was written at about this time too.—546 
5,5 The letter is not dated, but it may be assumed from its contents that it was 
written in reply to Marx's letter of 10 December 1859. Marx answered on 13 
December. So Engels must have written his letter between these two 
dates.—550 
516 This letter was first published in English in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, 
Correspondence. 1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary and Notes, Martin 
Lawrence Ltd., London [1934].—551 
517 The note mentioned is a letter to Marx from A. Peza, a London bookseller, of 
11 December 1859, communicating Hermann Juch's request to appoint the 
place and time for a meeting. Juch, the proprietor of the London weekly 
Hermann, wished to see Marx in order to get information on the Cologne 
Communist trial (see Note 71) which he needed because Wilhelm Stieber, the 
chief of the Prussian political police and the central figure in that trial, had 
lodged a complaint in a Berlin court against Karl Eichhoff,  the Berlin 
correspondent of the Hermann, who had denounced Stieber on its pages (see 
this volume, p. 536). 
In May 1860 Eichhoff was sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment.—552, 
554 
518 The letter is not dated, but since Marx answered it on 20 December 1859, it 
may be assumed that it wâs-written the day before. This is confirmed by Engels' 
mentioning that he hacUte» unable to write the article orr%forocco for the day 
when material was usually despatched from London to New York, in this case 
Tuesday, 20 December. The last day when an article due to get to London 

=====第678页=====
644 Notes 
from Manchester by December 20 ought to have been written was December 
19, and that was the day when Engels wrote this letter.—553 
519 Engels refers to the events of the Spanish-Moroccan war of 1859-60 (see Note 
490).  His next article on the subject published in the New-York Daily 
Tribune—'The Moorish War'—was written in mid-January 1860 (see present 
edition, Vol. 16).—553 
520 In a letter published in the Hermann on 17 December, Borkheim maintained that 
Blind enjoyed the same prestige in Baden and Württemberg as Kinkel in 
Prussia.—555 
521 The letter is not dated, but it has much in common in content with Marx's 
letter to Engels of 25 March 1856. Mrs Marx's mentioning of the report 'from 
the Berlin correspondent in to-day's Times' is evidence that she wrote the 
letter on 28 March.—561 
522 Probably one of Engels' articles on Pan-Slavism for the New-York Daily Tribune 
not published by the editors (see Note 11).—561 
523 The letter is not dated. Jenny Marx's asking whether the eye lotion had helped 
Engels, and the fact that Marx had notified him of the despatch of the lotion in 
a letter of 9 April 1857 warrant the assumption that Jenny was writing a few 
days after 9 April. Engels answered her letter about 16 April 1857 (see this 
volume, p. 121).—563 
524 The letter is not dated. Judging by its contents, it was in reply to Engels' letter 
to Marx of 29 July 1857 and the parcel he had sent die Marx family in London 
(see this volume, pp. 149-50). Of great help in dating the letter is Jenny's 
mentioning that Marx was busy 'shaping the Indian news into an article'. 
Judging by an entry in Marx's notebook, the article was despatched to the 
New-York Daily Tribune on 31 July 1857.—563 
525 The letter is not dated. It is the reply to Engels' letter to Mrs Marx of about 11 
August 1857, which has not been found. Marx mentions Engels' letter to Jenny 
in his letter to him of 15 August (see this volume, p. 151). Mrs Marx 
presumably answered Engels' letter shordy before that date.—565 
526 Jenny Marx means Jones' statement in the press in support of the popular 
uprising in India (see Note 178).—565 
527 The letter is not dated. But since Jenny Marx mentions her intention 'to write 
straight away' to Lassalle, and her letter to him is dated 9 April 1858, there is 
good reason to believe that her letter to Engels was written on die same day. 
This assumption is corroborated by Jenny's mentioning the arrival of the 
Manchester Guardians sent by Engels to London on 8 April, of which he 
informed Marx the next day (see this volume, pp. 304-05).— 569 
528 This is the reply to Lassalle's letter to Marx of 26 March 1858, in which 
Lassalle wrote that he had come to terms with the Berlin publisher Duncker on 
the publication of Marx's A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.—570 
529 The letter is not dated. As can be seen from its contents, it was written during 
Marx's stay with Engels in Manchester in May 1858 (see Note 318). Jenny 
probably wrote a few days after Marx's arrival there (6 May), since she 
mentions the enclosure of Cluss' letter to Marx which she had received after 
Cluss had visited her. On 11 May Engels communicated to Jenny a request by 
Marx concerning Cluss which probably had something to do with Cluss' letter 
which Jenny had forwarded to Marx (see this volume, p. 313).—571

Notes 645 
530 The letter is not dated. It was obviously written after 13 August 1859 since 
Jenny mentions the receipt by Marx of six copies of Engels' pamphlet Po and 
Rhine and Marx's intention to send some of them to Manchester the following 
week. Marx had promised to send copies of the pamphlet in a letter to Engels 
of 13 August 1859 (see this volume, p. 483).—572 
531 The letter is not dated. It may be assumed that it was written on 4 November 
1859,  because Engels answered it on 5 November 1859 (see this volume, 
p. 518) and because Jenny writes about Marx's 'struggling with Friday's article'. 
4 November was a Friday, one of the two days when Marx sent articles to the 
New-York Daily Tribune.—573 
532 This letter, written in reply to Engels' letter of 22 December 1859, is not dated. 
As can be seen from its contents, Jenny wrote it a day or two before Christmas, 
i. e., on 23 or 24 December 1859.—573 
533 xhis article of Marx's for the New-York Daily Tribune has not been 
found.—575
