PREFACE 
The fiftieth and concluding volume of the English edition of the works of 
Marx and Engels contains letters written by Engels between October 1892 
and July 1895. 
In the last years of his life, Enge ls witnessed amazing changes in the 
politics and economics of contemporary so ciety. Processes which began in 
the capitalist world in the 1870s had led, by the early 1890s, to major changes 
affecting every aspect of life, ther eby exerting a direct impact on the 
working-class movement. The emergence of parliamentary government, the 
expansion of voting rights, the complete legalisation of trade unions and 
other worker organisations  had created favourable conditions in which to 
campaign for a real improvement in the position of working people, for an 
increase of the influence of socialist parties and for the strengthening of their 
role in political life. There had also been changes in certain aspects of 
capitalist production, although these were not yet so obvious. As one might 
expect, Engels increasingly directed his thoughts to the prospects for and 
future of the struggle for working-class emancipation and to the ways and 
means of achieving its short-term and long-term goals; this is reflected in his 
numerous letters. His ideas on these issues  were neither the result of abstract 
argument, nor were they the merely th eoretical calculations of an academic 
isolated from the real world. To the e nd of his life, Engels maintained close 
contacts with the leaders of socialist parties in various European countries, 
with followers of Marx, with young scholars who showed an interest in his 
theoretical works and in Marxism, willingly sharing with them his views and 
ideas. A determined opponent of dogmatising, Engels revised many former 
concepts regarding forms and methods of proletarian struggle for workers’ 
rights and a radical reformation of society in the light of history and the 
major changes taking place in his own da y. Himself an eye-witness of the 
first steps taken by an independent working-class movement, and an active 
participant in this movement for almost fifty years, he was well

positioned to appreciate the undoubted successes achieved by it. He saw 
their successes as visible proof of the validity of the Marxist theory on the 
historical role of the working class. 
The early 1890s were, in this respect, a sign of things to come. By this 
time socialist parties had been set up in most European countries. They were 
winning ever-wider support, and held seats in the parliaments of a number of 
states. As a rule, their programmes we re based on Marxist theory. The most 
powerful of these parties, the Germ an Social-Democratic Party, whose 
success had led to the annulment of the Anti-Socialist law, was securing a 
growing number of votes at each successive  election, and there seemed to be 
every reason to believe that it might soon become a decisive power in the 
Reichstag. When the English trade-union congress decided to include in its 
programme the demand for the nationalisation of the means of production, 
when the trade union representatives were sent to international socialist 
congresses, and the Independent Labour  Party was set up in 1892, Engels 
began to anticipate the emergence in the near future of a mass political party 
of the English working class. The viability of the new International, which 
had emerged in the wake of the 1889 International Congress in Paris, had 
been proved by the enthusiastic response to its appeal for May Day 
demonstrations to campaign for an 8-hour working day. Hundreds of 
thousands of people were now taking pa rt in these demonstrations every 
year. 
All these events inspired Engels with optimism. If the working-class 
movement in the major countries of Eur ope continued to develop at this rate 
and along these same lines, then he be lieved this might accelerate the crisis 
of the capitalist system. ‘The growth of the proletarian movement in all 
countries’, he wrote to Bebel in October 1893, ‘is about to precipitate a crisis 
... which may not be upon us for some five or six years yet.’ This optimism 
was further strengthened, as letters published in this volume (pp. 172-189) 
reveal, by his trip to Europe in the summer of 1893, in the course of which 
he visited Vienna, Berlin and Prague , and attended the final session of the 
International Socialist Congress in Zurich. 
Engels’s belief that the capitalist system—at least in Europe, to which his 
statements on this subject are invari ably restricted—would collapse in the 
relatively near future was based not only on the success of the proletarian 
movement, but also on his theoretical analysis of new phenomena and trends 
in capitalist economics. In 1891, in hi s critique of the draft of the new 
programme of the German Social-Democratic Party, Engels

noted that the creation of large joint- stock companies and trusts meant ‘an 
end not only to private production but also to planlessness (present edition, 
Vol. 27, p. 224). Further on he writes that ‘the material and cultural 
conditions’ for the transformation of capitalist production into socialist 
production ‘on behalf of society as a whole and according to a preconceived 
plan’ are being created by cap italist society itself (ibid.). 
Subsequent events confirmed that Engels had correctly identified the 
trends appearing in the development of capitalist production. He believed, 
however, that these trends were lead ing, moreover in a relatively short 
historical period of time, to the collapse of the capitalist system. While 
appreciating that ‘those economic consequences of the capitalist system, 
which must bring it up to the critical point, are only just now developing’, he 
nonetheless considered it quite possible that this crisis in the capitalist system 
would occur quite soon as a result of ev ents taking place in the major states 
of Europe (see this volume, pp. 59, 75-6, 273). In articles, and particularly in 
letters, Engels identified individual cases of corruption involving a number of 
prominent politicians in France, Italy and elsewhere as symptoms revealing 
the general inability of the bourgeois st ate to discharge its functions, as 
indications that the existing social or der was on the verge of collapse. ‘... 
there is nothing stable about France ... a cr isis of the first water in Italy...—he 
wrote to F. A. Sorge on January 16, 1895, ‘in short, things are growing 
critical throughout the whole of Europe’ (p. 424). 
This crisis of bourgeois society, a crisis which Engels believed to be 
imminent, would also be the result, in his opinion, of the intensifying 
economic conflict among the major capitalist countries, caused in part by the 
emergence of the USA onto the world market. Developing this idea in a 
letter to N. F. Danielson, dated 24 February 1893, Engels wrote that 
economic rivalry between the USA on the one hand, and England, France 
and Germany on the other, could only mean that ‘the crisis must come, tout 
ce qu’ il y a de plus fin de siècle’ (p. 111). Clearly Engels supposed that this 
rivalry would provoke an acute economic crisis which would spread to the 
political and social spheres, and that this might well create the prerequisite 
conditions for the collapse of the capitalist system, a collapse which, so he 
believed, would occur not automatically, but as a result of the energetic 
actions of the working class. In Decem ber 1894, he wrote to P. Lavrov, ‘... 
the whole of Europe is warming up, crises are brewing everywhere, 
particularly in Russia’ (p. 389). Three months later, in a let- 
=====第16页=====
xvüi Preface  
ter to Vaillant, he wrote: ‘The end of the century is taking a decidedly 
revolutionary turn’ (p. 455). 
Pondering the various possible forms of that revolutionary crisis which 
might, in his view, create favourable conditions in which the proletariat 
could win political power in the countri es of Europe, Engels’s hopes turned 
in particular to Germany, which had the strongest socialist workers’ 
movement and was suffering from acute internal conflicts. On 5 December 
1892, he wrote to Laura Lafargue ‘the  next revolution ... is preparing in 
Germany with a consistency and stead iness unequalled anywhere else’ (p. 
59). He believed that the revolution, having begun in Germany or France, or 
possibly in some other country, for example in Austria or Russia, would 
inevitably spread to other countries. ‘If France’, he wrote to Lafargue on 27 
June 1893, ‘perhaps, gives the signal, it will be in Germany—the country 
most profoundly influenced by socialism, and where the theory has the most 
deeply penetrated the masses—where th e fight will be settled’ (p. 157). At 
the same time he believed it very likely that ‘if it does not bring the final 
victory, it will nevertheless make that  victory a foregone conclusion’ (p. 
175). 
As we now know, these prognostications were not fulfilled. However, this 
does not mean that they had no real basis. That his arguments were not 
groundless, and that he had accurately noted the trends is shown by the major 
events which marked the first decades of the 20th century. On 8 February 
1895, Engels wrote to G. V. Plekhanov: And when the devil of the revolution 
has someone at his collar, then he has Nicholas II ’ (p. 440). Indeed, ten years 
later, a popular revolution developed in the Russian Empire, and if it was not 
then victorious, it nonetheless shook the foundations of the autocracy and 
made a profound impact on other countries, particularly in the East. Engels 
often expressed the idea that the approaching war would be pan-European, 
and twenty years later that war broke out. However, his main prognosis 
concerning the imminent collapse of capitalism proved invalid, and not only 
as regards the timing. Having recognised that his and Marx’s hopes that the 
proletariat would be victorious as early as the mid-19th century (see present 
edition, Vol. 22, p. 533) were mistaken, Engels nonetheless remained captive 
to such illusions, believing that capitalism had already exhausted its potential 
by the end of the century, and that conditions were ripe for the emergence of 
new social relations. His postulates that the latest economic crisis would 
bring with it the collapse of bourgeois society, that capitalism had outlived

itself and was at the time failing to stimulate the development of productive 
forces were proved mistaken by the subsequent course of history. 
However, those same facts upon which Engels based himself when as-
sessing the objective pre-conditions necessary for the victory of the new 
social order, for a socialist revolution,  facts which, so it seemed to him, 
confirmed the inevitability of the emergence in the near future of the 
possibility of a radical reformation of society, were also the facts which 
prompted him to reassess concepts formulated in the wake of the revolutions 
of the 19th century as regards the ways a nd means by which the proletariat 
could achieve political power, a factor which he considered of major 
importance and a necessary prerequisite of any transition to new social 
relations 
The letters published in this volume reveal the development of Engels’ 
thoughts on the strategy and tactics of the emancipation struggle. He realised 
that the methods used in those revolutions in which he himself had been 
actively involved were no longer applicable : ‘The era of barricades and street 
fighting has gone for good; if the military fight, resistance becomes madness. 
Hence the necessity to find new revolutionary tactics, (see this volume, p. 21) 
he wrote to Lafargue in November 1892. At the same time—and most 
importantly—by the 1890s the working class in the majority of European 
countries had much greater opportunity to use legal methods thanks to the 
emergence, albeit in differing forms, of parliamentary government. Here 
Engels attributed the main role to parliamentary activity by the socialists, and 
to universal suffrage. He did so ba sing himself on the experience of the 
German Social-Democratic Party, whose practical activity d eeply influenced 
his thinking. A number of Engels’s letters (to Victor Adler on 11 October, to 
August Bebel on 12 October, and on 18 October 1893) contain ideas which 
received their final formulati on in Engels’s last work, Introduction to Karl 
Marx’s ‘The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850’. Emphasising the 
importance of the campaign for universal suffrage then being mounted in 
Belgium and Austria, he wrote to August Bebel: ‘The suffrage movement 
won its first victory in Belgium, and now Austria is about to follow suit. At 
the outset this will ensure the survival of universal suffrage, but also 
encourage us to make further demands—in Germany no less than in France 
and Italy’ (p. 206). In another letter to Bebel he again emphasises the 
importance of legal methods of proletarian struggle, arguing that 
‘governments are again coming under the control of a living political 
movement among the 
=====第18页=====
XX Preface  
people ... it is we who determine it’, its ‘conquests in the libertarian sense, 
greater political power for the working man, the extension of his freedom of 
movement’ (p. 219). 
The letters published in this volume provide manifest evidence of the 
pleasure which Engels felt at the su ccesses of the socialists and their 
increasing influence. This is clearly seen in a letter from Engels to Julia, 
Bebel’s wife, about a meeting between Be bel, Lafargue and Burns at his flat: 
‘That such a meeting should be possible, a meeting at which the three leading 
parliaments of Europe, the three dominant nations of Europe, will be 
represented by three Socialist Party l eaders, is in itself proof of what 
enormous advances we have made’ (p . 131). A year later he expressed his 
confident belief that ‘before long th ere will be no European parliament 
without labour representatives (ibid., p. 283). ‘Today’, he wrote to E. 
Vandervelde in October 1894, ‘the soci alist movement everywhere is more 
powerful than the so-called public for ce’ (p. 357). These successes, achieved 
by using exclusively ‘legal’ methods, strengthened his view that universal 
suffrage and other legal methods now made it possible for the working class 
to win political power by peaceful means. He anticipated, however, 
preventive actions by reactionary forces. Such counter-measures must, in his 
opinion, inevitably involve the violati on of constitutional rights and the open 
use of force. This, in its turn, might  compel the masses to offer direct 
resistance, that is, to attempt to seize power by force, by the use of arms. In 
other words, Engels did not exclude the possibility of using such methods, 
but only in response to coercive action by the ruling circles. ‘Where there is 
no reactionary power to be overthrow n’, he wrote to Bebel on 7 October 
1892, ‘there can be no question whatever of revolutionary power (p. 8). He 
developed this same idea further in a letter to Lafargue a month later: ‘It’s 
even ten to one that universal suffrage, intelligently used by  the workers, will 
drive the rulers to overthrow legality, that  is, to put us in the most favourable 
position to make the revolution’ (p. 29). Nonetheless he continues to see any 
attempt at armed uprising as foredoomed if the ruling circles still command 
the armed forces. He did not, it is true, exclude the possibility that in 
Germany, the army might become ‘ 1/3 —  2/5 socialist’ (p. 225) as a result of 
the growing influence of the Social-Democratic Party in the countryside, 
which provided the bulk of army recruits.  However,  as many  of his letters  
show,  he hoped  in the main that the current situation would enable the 
socialists to become the parliamentary majority, and thus implement their 
immediate goals.

Preface  xxi 
Such an outcome, however, in Engels’ view, could only be achieved by 
expanding socialist influence to ever br oader sections of working people, and 
above all, the working class. ‘A revolution in the minds’ of workers, he 
wrote, ‘ ... is a guarantee of a fa r mightier and more comprehensive 
revolution in the world’. (p. 296). He attached particular significance to 
socialist propaganda among the peasantry, ‘without which we cannot expect 
to be victorious’. 
In his letters, Engels devotes consid erable space to his thoughts on specific 
events in the European proletarian movement, moreover not only in 
Germany, France and England, as in pr evious years, but also in Austria, 
Belgium and Italy, where this movement was rapidly gaining strength. An 
increasing number of letters pass between Engels and Victor Adler, Filippo 
Turati, Antonio Labriola (most of the letters addressed to Labriola have still 
not been found). New names also appeared, such as E. Vandervelde, leader 
of the Belgian socialists. Engels’s attention was drawn in particular to facts 
demonstrating the success of the socialists and their practical activity, the 
struggle of the popular masses to extend democratic freedoms, strikes and 
other worker demonstrations in support of their economic demands. These 
letters illustrate Engels’s deep interest in internal party issues, and especially 
in the larger and more influential parties. In Germany these issues concerned 
relations between the Marxist core of the party leadership and reformist 
elements, particularly in matters relating to the party programme, and also to 
parliamentary tactics; in France the main issues were solidarity among 
socialist forces, ways and means of cr eating a single socialist party, and the 
role and tactics of ‘the workers’ movement in this process; in England the 
issues were the creation of a mass independent party of the working class, the 
role of existing socialist organisations in this process, their mutual relations, 
and also the need to support the trade unions in their desire to take an active 
part in the international socialist workers’ movement; in Italy the main issue 
was that of strengthening, both organisationally and ideologically, the young 
socialist party, etc. 
In a number of letters Engels expressed his views on the state of and pros-
pects for the socialist movement in the USA. He saw the sources of its weak-
ness as lying not so much in the sectarian line being pursued by the Socialist 
workers’ Party, the bulk of whose membership was made up of German immi-
grants, as in objective circumstances, wh ich created ‘considerable and peculiar 
difficulties to the steady growth of a labour party’ (p. 236). 
=====第20页=====
XX11 Preface  
While criticising the reformist tendency which existed in some socialist 
parties, Engels nonetheless considered that such differences of opinion 
should be solved primarily by internal party debate, but that ‘to do away with 
every question involving genuine contr oversy’, was impermissible (p. 376). 
Furthermore, as regards the various views among socialists on the ways and 
means of achieving their immediate goal—the political power of the 
proletariat—he wrote: ‘Once we are ag reed on that, differences of opinion ... 
as to the ways and means of struggle are unlikely to give rise to a dispute 
over principles’ (p. 119). 
Engels’s letters offer striking evidence of his desire to give every possible 
encouragement to contacts among leaders of socialist parties in different 
countries, and to inform his colleagues about the experience acquired in the 
course of the liberation struggle, about major events in the working-class 
movement, and about the state of affairs in socialist organisations. He 
informs the Lafargues in detail about the electoral successes of the German 
Social-Democrats (p. 154), about the state of affairs in English socialist 
organisations (pp. 342-44). He inform s Bebel about the English miners’ 
strike (pp. 204-5), with Sorge he sh ares his views on the activities of the 
French Workers’ Party (p. 249), on the po litical situation in England (pp. 81, 
229), and on the battle among various tr ends within the German Social-
Democratic Party (pp. 141-42). Almost every event of any significance in the 
European workers’ movement between 1893 and 1895 is reflected to some 
degree or other in his letters of this period. 
The material published in this volume shows that Engels continued his 
contacts with Russian socialists, revealing a lively interest in the situation in 
Russia. Having analysed the situation in the country, he posited that it might 
soon become the arena of revolutionary events. How well Engels knew the 
situation in Russia is revealed by his letter to N. F. Danielson, who translated 
Das Kapitalmto Russian and with whom he corresponded for many years, up 
to the end of his life. In a letter written on 24 February 1893, Engels noted 
the acute social contradictions, in this country with a huge peasant 
population, where, as a result of the rapid if belated, development of 
capitalism, the crisis might prove ... mo re powerful and acute than anywhere 
else (p. 112). 
Together with an analysis  of the current state of affairs in the proletarian 
liberation struggle in various countries and its future prospects, Engels’s 
letters also contain his assessment of and ideas on the consolidation and 
development of international proletarian links, the activities of 
=====第21页=====
Preface  xxüi 
the new International, and relations among the socialist parties. In many 
cases where misunderstandings clouded these relations, Engels acted as an 
arbiter, seeking to mitigate the discord and to assist in finding a compromise 
solution. The position he adopted helped, for example, in resolving the 
conflict between the German Social-Dem ocratic Party and socialists in a 
number of other countries  over whether May 1 shoul d be marked by ceasing 
work, or should be limited to demonstrations held in the evening (see volume 
49, p. 115). On this issue Engels argued that every party must adhere to the 
international commitments it had assumed or, if that were not possible, reach 
agreement on its actions with the other parties to such commitments. Engels 
believed that complete equality and independence in resolving problems 
constituted the essential basis of relations among socialist parties, a belief he 
set out most clearly in a letter to Lafargue dated 3 January 1894: ‘A certain 
manner of proceeding may be excelle nt for one country, and utterly 
impossible or even disastrous in another’ (p. 254). 
Engels supported the widest possible participation in international socialist 
congresses by working-class organisations, including those which did not 
pursue socialist aims. ‘These groups’, he wrote to Turati on 16 August 1894, 
‘by the very fact of attending our congresses, are unconsciously drawn into 
the socialist lap’ (p. 341). 
Not believing himself to have the right to interfere in the activities of 
socialist parties, Engels limited himself to advice and recommendations, and 
even these he sent only to those closest to him, to whom he was able to say 
unpalatable things with perfect frankness. To Bebel, Liebknecht, Kautsky, 
Paul and Laura Lafargue, Adler, Sorge and others with whom he regularly 
corresponded, he gave his evaluati ons and expressed his criticisms, 
occasionally in quite sharp, and in some cases perhaps not altogether 
objective terms. However, this was not intended for the eyes of others, nor, of 
course, was it seen by either writer or reader as some infallible truth. Indeed, 
many optimistic prognostications and hopes were not intended for 
publication at all, were often coloured with emotion, and in many cases 
cannot be viewed as the result of any precise or detailed analysis. 
The case is very different when it comes to letters written to people with 
whom Engels was little acquainted, often in reply to direct theoretical 
questions, or containing theoretical criticism of a particular economic, 
philosophical or historical work, or outspoken polemics with 
=====第22页=====
xxiv Preface  
their authors. Here Engels is always precise, his evaluations restrained, his 
conclusions argued and less categorical. Su ch, for example, are his letters to 
Franz Mehring (14 July 1893) and to Borgius (25 January 1894). which are 
de voted to clarifying a number of fundamental questions relating to the 
materialist concept of history, and which conclude, as it were, a cycle of 
letters dealing with this subject and published in Volume 49 of the present 
edition. Here he returns yet again to a criticism of the vulgar interpretation of 
historical materialism, which denies that ideological or other non-economic 
factors have any influence whatsoev er on the historical process. ‘An 
historical moment, once it is ushered into the world by other, ultimately 
economic, causes,’ he wrote to Mehring, ‘will react in its turn, and may exert 
a reciprocal influence on its environment, and even upon its own causes’ (p. 
165). 
These letters may be grouped together with a number of others also 
devoted to theoretical and historical questions: to Robert Meyer, 19 July 
1893; to W. Sombart, 11 March, and to Conrad Schmidt, 12 March 1895; and 
also to Hirsch, 19 March, to Paul Lafa rgue, 3 April, to Karl Kautsky, 21 May 
1895, and a few others. Of particular interest here are comments of a 
methodological nature, still pertinent toda y. Engels once again warns against 
a dogmatic approach to Marxism. ‘But Marx’s whole way of thinking’, he 
wrote to Sombart, ‘is not so much a doctrine as a method. It provides not so 
much ready-made dogmas as aids to fu rther investigation, and the method for 
such investigation’ (p. 461). His thoughts on the objective nature of the 
historical process are very profound: ‘As Marx sees it, the whole of past 
history, so far as major events are concerned, is an unconscious process, i.e., 
those events and the consequences th ereof are not deliberate; either the 
supernumeraries of history have wanted something that was the diametrical 
opposite of what was achieved, or else that achievement entailed 
consequences quite other than those th at had been foreseen’ (ibid). Engels 
sets out his understanding of the di alectics of the necessary and the 
fortuitous, the concept and the phenomenon (p. 466), ideologies (p. 164), the 
role of the individual in history (p. 266), and also some ideas on the history 
of the Peasant War in Germany in the 16th century (p. ???), the communal 
form of ownership (pp. 214, 488) and other questions. 
As in previous years, questions of  foreign policy were often touched upon 
in Engels’ correspondence, primarily in  terms of ascertaining the position of 
the socialist parties with respect to the threat of war. Engels 
=====第23页=====
Preface  xxv 
was more certain than ever that ‘the next war, if it comes at all, will not 
permit of being localised in any way’, that ‘given the enormous armies of 
today and the appalling consequences fo r the vanquished, a localised war is 
no longer possible’ (p. 100). He repeated again and again that the socialist 
workers’ movement had no interest whatsoever in war. ‘At the moment a war 
would be utterly useless to us; we have a sure means of making progress 
which a war could only disrupt’, he wrote to Sorge, on 18 January 1893 (p. 
84). In his letters there is a reference to a series of articles entitled ‘Can 
Europe Disarm?’, written with the aim of helping the German Social-
Democratic Party determine its position on the draft new military law (p. 
107). He also used these articles when th e French socialists turned to him for 
advice during the drafting of a law to replace a standing army with a militia 
system (p. 253). 
Right up to the end of 1894, Engels’ letters reveal the enormous work he 
had to undertake in order to prepare for the press the manuscripts of the third 
volume of Das Kapital. Having returned to this work in the autumn of 1892, 
he continued it, with only brief interruptions, up to the publication of the 
book at the beginning of December 1894. Almost every letter during these 
years contains at least one brief reference to his work on the manuscript, and 
then on the proofs. ‘I have been compelled to decline all outside work, 
though ever so tempting, unless absolute ly necessary’, he wrote in March 
1893 (p. 123). More than a year later, having sent the last part of the 
manuscript to the printers, he summed up the situation in a letter to Nikolai 
Danielson: ‘Everything not absolutely n ecessary had to be put back in order 
to finish Vol. 3rd’ (p. 309). 
Following the publication of the book, Engels immediately began to carry 
through his own plans. On 17 Decem ber 1894 he described to Laura 
Lafargue a detailed plan for re-editions and new works, a plan amazing in its 
scope. ‘That is my position’, he wrote, ‘74 years, which I am beginning to 
feel, and work enough for two men of 40 ... But as it is, all I can do is to 
work on with what is before me and ge t through it as far and as well as I can’ 
(p. 387). He did not abandon the idea of new editions of the earlier works of 
Marx, which had become virtually unobtainable, and, as he wrote to R. 
Fischer on 15 April 1895, ‘I have a sche me for again presenting Marx’s and 
my lesser writings to the public in a complete edition’ (p. 497). However he 
succeeded in carrying through only a small part of this project. 
The contents of this volume reveal the attention which Engels gave, 
=====第24页=====
xxvi Preface  
regardless of his occupation with other affairs, to new editions of Marx’s 
works and of his own, and their translation into other languages. He wrote 
the introductions for new editions, edite d or read through translations. He 
willingly assisted followers of Ma rx who published articles popularising 
Marx’s theory and seeking to apply the materialist concept of history to the 
study of specific facts and events. 
The volume contains a wealth of materi al revealing Engels’s character, his 
responsiveness and willingness to repl y to any question, provide any 
assistance not only to those close to hi m, but on occasion even to people he 
barely knew or did not know at all. His rigorous adherence to principle 
combined with a desire to listen to, understand and seek to convince his 
opponent, his readiness to engage in any discussion, but his intolerance of 
pretence and deliberate falsehood. Many of his letters are full of concern for 
Marx’s daughters, his friends and supporte rs, in whose affairs he always took 
an active interest. 
Special mention must be made of those of Engels’s letters which speak 
about his trip to the continent in August-September 1893. In them he de-
scribes his impressions of what he sa w and the changes that had taken place 
in Europe over the previous two decades, the state of affairs in the workers’ 
movement in Germany and Austria, and his assessment of the International 
Socialist Congress in Zurich. Everything in these letters is of interest: the 
details of daily life noted by his sharp eye, his stories, full of humour and 
good will, about people he met, and his optimistic impressions of meetings 
with workers—members of th e Social-Democratic Party. 
Some of the letters contain references to the writing and publication of

Obvious slips of the pen in the texts of the letters have been corrected 
without indication. Abbreviated proper names, geographical names and 
individual words are given in full. Defects in the manuscript are indicated in 
footnotes, while lost or illegible passages of the text are indicated by 
omission points. If occasional reconstructi on is possible it is given in square 
brackets. Any passages deleted by the author are reproduced at the bottom of 
the page in cases where there is a significant discrepancy. Rough drafts of 
letters or fragments reproduced in some other documents, etc., are indicated 
either in the text itself, or in the notes. 
Foreign words and expressions in the text of the letters are left as given by 
the author, with a translation where necessary; Russian (cyrillic) words are 
noted but printed in English. English words and expressions used by Engels 
in text written in German and French are printed in small caps; (large caps if 
capitalized in original). 
In the case of references to one and th e same fact or event in the texts of 
different letters, the endnote number is duplicated. 
The texts of the letters and notes were prepared by Oksana Matkovskaya 
(letters from October 1892 to August 1893), Yevgeniya Dakhina (letters 
from September 1893 to December 1894), and Natalia Kalennikova (letters 
from 1895 onwards and supplements). The Preface was written by Boris 
Tartakovsky. The volume was edited by Irina Shikanyan, Valerija Kunina 
and Boris Tartakovsky. The Name Inde x and the Index of Periodicals were 
prepared Vera Popova; index of quot ed and mentioned literature by 
Alexander Panfilov (Russian Independent Institute of Social and National 
Problems). 
This volume, including the Subject Index, was prepared for the press by 
International Publishers, New York, from the manuscript materials available. 
To The Reader 
Volume 50 completes the first and, as yet, the only edition of the works 
and correspondence of Karl Marx and Fr ederick Engels in English known as 
the Collected Works.  
This edition of the works of Marx and Engels was undertaken on the 
request of Marxist scholars in England and the USA by the Institute of 
Marxism-Leninism (now the Russian Independent Institute of Social and 
National Problems, and is published jointly by Lawrence and Wishart (Great 
Britain), International Publishers (USA) and ‘Progress’ 
=====第26页=====
xxvüi Preface  
(now Progress Publishing Group Corporation), Moscow. The idea of 
publishing this unique English-language edition of the Collected Works of 
the founders of Marxism was supported by scholars not only in English-
speaking countries, but also in a number of other countries in Europe and 
Asia. The high level of scholarship a nd the quality of the publication have 
repeatedly won commendation in the international press. The present edition 
is the most complete of all those issued to date. It offers the reader a 
comprehensive review of the written legacy of Marx and Engels, reveals the 
development of Marx’s theory from the moment of its inception, and sets the 
works in their historical context. 
This edition comprises 1,968 works, including those which remained 
unfinished, or which were not published during the lifetime of their authors, 
as well as other documents written by them. Approximately half of these 
(805) are here published in English for the first time. Thirteen volumes 
(volumes 38-50) are devoted to the enormous epistolary output of Marx and 
Engels—3,957 letters—of which most (2,283) have hitherto never been 
published in English. 
This edition also offers English-speaking readers their first opportunity to 
acquaint themselves with a newly comprehensive way of publishing Marx’s 
economic works, including the three volumes of Capital and two preparatory 
manuscripts (volumes 30-37). 
Great changes have taken place since Ma rx and Engels wrote their works, 
changes which could not be anticipated in their day, and many postulates in 
their theory now inevitably require critical reassessment. One thing, 
however, remains indisputable, and that is the enormous contribution they 
made to the development of socialist thought. The unbiased reader can 
appreciate the scale of thei r intellectual influence. 
There can be no doubt that the publication of the theoretical and 
epistolary work of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels has enriched man’s 
scientific and cultural legacy. 
The editors wish to express their th anks to subscribers and readers for 
their co-operation over a period of some 29 years (the first volume was 
published in 1975), during which they have expressed both criticism and 
unwavering interest, and also commendable patience in awaiting publication 
of the final volumes.

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN IN 
HANOVER 
London, 4 October 1892 
Dear Kugelmann, 
Very many thanks for the little bit of Leibnitz. 1 
As regards Herr Vogt, please send one copy to Bebel and two to me, but if 
you yourself don’t possess another, it goes without saying that you should 
keep one and send only one to me. 2 
As regards The Knight of the Noble Consciousness and Palmerston, What 
Has He Done, I have unearthed one more copy of each and these are en-
closed herewith. 
On the other hand I have only one copy of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, 
but no loose issues, and only a few volumes of the Revuec; if I want a 
complete set I have to borrow it. Y ou had better get Miquel to return you 
yours. After all he is the only one who might now be endangered by its 
possession and he’ll be grateful to you for taking it off his hands. However 
Volume I as well as other indivi dual volumes occasionally crop up in 
second-hand booksellers’ catalogues. 
For the rest, I am keeping tolerably well. But if you are expecting an 
exhaustive pathological discourse on my somewhat complicated and no 
doubt also somewhat obscure case, I’m afraid I cannot oblige you. I am in 
correspondence with many doctors in 5 or 6 countries and all of them

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 7 October 1892 
Dear August, 
First to business. 
Lafargue sent me a France with the enclosed notice of an interpellation by 
Millevoye, 5 a Boulangist. 6 He intends to make use of this opportunity to 
remind the Chamber of everything done by the German Socialists in 1871 
and thereafter to maintain or restore good relations between France and 
Germany, and of what they have had to endure as a result. He would like to 
have: 
les dates des protestations des socia listes allemands, les paroles prononcées 
au Reichstag et ailleurs, et les condamnations subies a . 
Now since the things I have here are incomplete or only to be extracted 
with untold labour from collections of periodicals buried in numerous 
packing-cases, during which process I might easily overlook what is most 
important, you would greatly oblige me and the French if you would take out 
the most cogent items and send them to me together with dates and 
references (from the official stenographic report). That is, 
a The dates of the protests by the German Soci alists, the speeches made in the Reichstag and 
elsewhere, and the sentences served.  
=====第32页=====
6 Letters-1892  
1. The statements which led to the incarceration of the Brunswick 
Executive in 1870 in Lötzen, along with date and period of detention. 7 
2. Your protest in the Reichstag against the annexation 8 and perhaps also 
one or two cogent passages from the Volksstaat attacking the war and the 
annexation; 
3. A few trenchant excerpts from la ter Reichstag speeches by you and 
Liebknecht, along with dates and particulars of the subject of the debate in 
which they were made; 
4. Anything else that seems to you important. 
Not a great deal is needed. You w ill know roughly how much is needed 
for a speech and if you then add 1 or 2 spare quotations, that will do. I should 
be glad if you would also quote some of your own statements, lest the French 
should imagine that Liebknecht did it all himself or even say that Liebknecht 
was an exception and that the others thought differently. 
Yesterday we sent you in the Workman’s Times 2 French newspapers with 
reports on Liebknecht’s speeches and also a piece by Guesde which will 
have pleased you. a 
Lafargue will be drumming up support in Carmaux and other towns in the 
South until his return on the 16th or 17th of this month, That is when the 
Chamber reassembles, and he must have the material by then. 9 
He writes to say that the patriotic press, all of which, and particularly La 
France, is in the pay of Russia, has launched furious attacks on Liebknecht. 
The Russian embassy now pays the newspapers by the job—so much for 
each individual article accepted. Which is  also a sign that the Russians are 
short of funds. There is no doubt that Liebknecht has raised a furore. I don’t 
begrudge the old man his popularity and, in two respects, can only hope, 1. 
that it won’t make him even more obstinate with regard to the editorship of 
the Vorwärts and, 2. that in the Reichstag the malicious sniping of the 
German patriots and accusations of hi gh treason, etc., don’t suddenly 
provoke him into maintaining the opposite, thereby landing not just himself 
in the cart but us as well. A reporter on the Gaulois quotes him as saying: 
‘Were Germany to declare a war of  aggression on France, the German 
Socialists would declare war on their own government, et moi-même je 
prendrais un fusil pour

défendre l’intégrité du territoire française’ a When he corrects this obviously 
exaggerated report, it is not impossible that he will go to the opposite 
extreme, should the Junkers and bourgeois in the Reichstag work him up into 
a real passion. 
Lafargue says that Loubet and the Minister for Public Works, Viette, 
would go to considerable lengths to bring about an acceptable settlement of 
the strike at Carmaux 10 and compel the company to climb down, but that 
Freycinet is against it. The latter has designs on the presidency of the 
Republic and therefore wants to keep in with the voters of the Right and the 
Centre. 
Otherwise, Lafargue is very satisfied with the Congress. 11 
The 12 copies of the Neue Zeit 12 arrived here and were passed on to 
Tussy. The chaps ought to have sent them to her instead of to me, but as it 
was a day was lost. Unfortunately th ere has recently been a change of 
ownership at the Pall Mall Gazette and we don’t yet know what prospects the 
paper will now hold out for us. 
Your account of the movement among the miners tallies with our 
experience in this country; here, too, the chaps keep themselves very much 
apart from the other branches of labour and are progressing more slowly than 
the rest. But in our case, the fact that there is already a strong workers’ party 
behind them will eventually s ee us through; the chaps are bound to join us, 
once the movement has taken a hold on them. On the other hand there are, 
both here and in Germany, bad and unr eliable leaders who cannot be induced 
to trust the workers in other branches. In this country, moreover, the petty 
jealousies existing between the men of one coal-field and another have so far 
not even permitted the creation of a united guild comprising all mine 
workers. 
I shall do my utmost to stop the French from dispensing with your con-
tributions. It is vitally important th at occasionally, at any rate, accurate 
reports on the German movement should appear in Paris and particularly that 
the public should be made aware of th e general political situation in which 
you people have to carry on the fight. You alone can do that, nor is there any 
need at all for you to come into conflict with Liebknecht as a result, provided 
he doesn’t regard contributions to the French paperb as his monopoly. That 
wouldn’t do at all.

You need have no fear that Burns is keeping too much in the background. 
The man’s vanity is on a par with Lassalle’s. But compared with the 
precipitate way in which K. Hardie thrusted himself to the fore to secure 
pride of place by resorting to little dodges, he was unques tionably right in 
adopting a non-committal attitude. 
At the moment I am reading Hans Müllera and have not yet finished. It is 
all stale stuff and long familiar to us. The few bad speeches he quotes are not 
even skilfully chosen. Had I wanted to make out a case against the petty-
bourgeois goings-on in the party or parliamentary group, I should have 
provided quite different material. The Steamship Subvention alone provides 
eight times as much as he does and of better quality. 13 He takes a speech 
made by Liebknecht in 1881 14 during the period of general confusion that 
followed the promulgation of the Anti-Socialist Law 15 instead of later ones 
when the political situation makes the pacific, philistine overtones seem far 
less excusable, and then goes so far as  to assert that power is in all 
circumstances revolutionary and never r eactionary. The jackass fails to notice 
that where there is no reactionary power to be overthrown there can be no 
question whatever of revolutionary power. After all, you cannot start a 
revolution against something that can be removed without the least effort. 
If there is one thing that sends the self-opinionated students, the men of 
letters and the would-be literati of the working class into a state of impotent 
rage, it is the sight of our party calmly continuing along its victorious course 
without needing the help from these petty panjandrums. If mistakes are made, 
the party is strong enough to deal with them itself. Witness the undeniably 
tame philistinism of the majority of th e parliamentary group at the time of the 
Steamship Subvention, wit-ness the traditional tendency of the Party 
Executive, a tendency which continued to manifest itself for a short while 
after the Anti-Socialist Law had been repeal ed, to intervene in a dictatorial 
manner (and which, moreover, had its counterpart in an identical tendency 
among the executives of the previous Berlin organisation), etc., etc. Our 
Party is now so strong that it could, without risk of degeneration, digest not 
only a goodly number of petty bourgeois but also the “heddicated” and even 
the worthy Independents, 16 had not the latter given themselves their 
marching orders.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 14 October 1892 
My dear Lohr, 
Thanks from Louise and myself for your  letters this morning. Had one from 
Paul from Bordeaux last night. Business first. Enclosed you find 
1. Manifest des sozial demokr atischen Ausschusses (Executive) 
Braunschweig 5. September 1870a with a letter from Mohr and myself 18 but 
which Paul better quote as from Mohr, who, I believe, signed it. This is 
referred to in the MS. extracts under No. II I (on page 2). 
2. First and Second Addresses of the General Council of the 
International on the War, July 23rd 1870 and Sept. 9th 1870.b With French 
translation made, I believe, in Geneva; it very likely requires revision both as 
to correctness and style. 
3. A series of MS. extracts received from Bebel who with his wifec set to 
work at once to supply us with what we wanted. 
I think this will be sufficient for Paul’s speech, though I don’t envy you 
the task of translating all these things, especially the rather lax style of our 
Reichstag orators. 
Anyhow, now Paul is armed and need not depend upon Liebknecht’s 
promises which are sooner made than kept, as a rule. 
I am glad Paul is going to take part again in the debates of the Chambre,d 
and if he is wise, he will attend the Palais Bourbon 6 assiduously during this 
last session of the present Parliament. I have some notion that electors want 
to see and hear something of the parliamentary activity of their deputy, and if 
they do not, there may be a risk not only of losing his seat, but also of not so 
easily securing another. After all, as things are now, both in France and 
Germany, electoral success in many places  at least, depends on the votes of a 
number of hangers-on of the party, men

that are influenced by petty considerations, and whose simple abstention may 
lose the seat. Then, too, Paul’s first speech 19 showed evident signs of 
embarras, caused by his not being used to the new atmosphere where he had 
to live, move and have his being; and th e sooner and the more he gets used to 
that and to the parliamentary forms, standing orders, and business habits of 
the Chambre, the better. This time he will have to show them that their 
howlings and interruptions will not intimidate him, and if he only tries, I am 
sure he can do it. I don’t know French Chambers, but it seems to me, in a 
similar case I should take no notice of interruptions, reply to none of them, 
and in the last extremity call upon the president to ensure to me my right of 
being heard. (Capital advice on the part of one who notoriously cannot keep 
his own temper!) 
Arndt you describe quite correctly. I see from Liebknecht’s report on his 
journeya that he gives Arndt a mild slap but a slap anyhow, and probably he 
will have been told, at Marseille, of the proceedings of Blanquists 20 and 
Allemanists. 21 Liebknecht seems quite intoxicated with his triumph and, for 
the moment, plus français que les français eux-mêmes}b Unfortunately he 
always deals in extremes, and I can onl y hope that he will not be goaded, by 
patriotic bullies in the Reichstag, into tumbling head over heels into the 
opposite extreme. So far, his a ttitude in his speeches in Mannheim 22 etc. has 
been all that could be desired. 
I understand your news about Roubaix to this effect that the people there 
will ask Paul to stand for the Chamber next autumn. That would be very 
good, Roubaix would be a pretty safe seat , while Lille seems rather shaky, to 
be carried at a period of extra local exc itement, but very uncertain, so far, at 
ordinary periods. 
Anyhow, ca marche en Francec (everything but the Journal quotidien!)d 
and Carmaux 10 shows not only the progress of our ideas among the working-
class, but also the fact of the bourgeois and the government knowing, it. The 
self-contained attitude of the people there— et encore des méridiouaux, des 
Gascons gasconnants!e—and the quiet but determined way in which the 
socialist town-councils proceed wit hout any possibil-ist weakness or 
concessions, show an immense progress.  The more the French are coming to 
the front, the more I shall be glad. The Continental movement, to be 
victorious, must be neither all French nor all German,

but franco-allemand. If the Germans taught the French how to use the

I have your letters of 31 July and the 9th inst. It was my fault that Pumps

to write in German off her own bat, a nd so I did it for her. Naturally I knew 
nothing of her tippling exploits in Darmstadt and put “Sie”. Her husbandc is 
not to blame, for he knows no German. Pumps is expecting a child any day, 
her fourth. Her second, a boy, unfortunately died, while her youngest, also a

letter for several days in the hope of  hearing from him. But up till now there 
has been nothing. The position is that I must know first of all how exhaustive 
the biography is to be, whether it is intended for a periodical and if so which, 
etc., etc. If the man proposes to deal with our Carla merely qua chemist, all he 
needs are a few particulars that could serve as a framework. If, however, he 
intends to depict the man as he was, the question arises as to whether he is 
the most suitable candidate and whether one ought, without further inquiry, 
to place at his disposal the letters to and from Carl. Again, a chemist living in 
Germany would necessarily be unfamiliar with the circumstances of a man 
who had lived in England for 30 years and more, and this would involve me 
in work of a much more comprehensive nature. That would not deter me. I 
should gladly devote as much time to it as I could spare, once I had seen the 
back of Volume II I of Capital to which I have now returned. But who will 
provide me with a guarantee that my information is used in the spirit in 
which it was given? When in our presence, and in fact he spent all his 
vacations here in London except when he went to Germany in the summer, 
Carl was first and foremost a Social Democrat and up till now Social 
Democrats have been somewhat thinly  represented in the ranks of the 
chemists. It certainly wouldn’t do if, in his biography, the biographer were, 
so to speak, to beg his readers’ pa rdon because the man whose life he was 
depicting had had the misfortune to be a Social Democrat! 
Anschutz was, if I’m not mistaken, for a time a pupil of Carl’s in 
Manchester. As already mentioned; I shall be glad to be of service—in so far 
as I have the time—but first of all I must know what is required and what 
kind of biography it is to be. 
The executors in Manchesterb are right in wanting to wind up whatever 
can be wound up without going into the settlement of the copyright 
questions. That will take time if only because the publishers stand to gain 
from a certain delay and are therefore in no hurry. I have heard nothing from 
Roscoe either; doubtless he won’t make a move until he can put forward and 
accept or reject specific proposals. 
I hope your daughter continues to improve and that she has been able to 
leave her bed in the meantime.

ENGELS TO CHARLES BONNIER 
IN OXFORD 
[Draft]  
London, mid-October 1892 
My dear Bonnier, 
I have received Prototc—thank you. First of all, however, a correction. 
You say: 
‘whereas the French socialists are protesti ng against the Russian alliance and do not wish 
to hear about a war with Germany, Bebel in pa rticular and you yourse lf are quite willing to 
accept the idea of a defensive war against France and Russia in which the German socialists 
would take part’, and that ‘these accusations , which are well received in France, irritate 
Guesde’.  
If the French socialists are not expre ssly discussing the case of a defensive 
war in which they would be willing to repel an attack by the Emperor 
William,d this is because it is well known, recognised and accepted that

there is no need to talk about it. There is not a single socialist in Germany 
who doubts that in such a case the French socialists would only be doing 
their duty in defending their national independence; there is not one who 
would hold it against them; on the contrary, they would applaud them, That 
is precisely the point of view in my articlea. If I were not proceeding from the 
view that, should there be a foreign attack, the French socialists would take 
up arms to defend their homes, the whole of my article would be absurd. 
What I am requesting is the benefit of the same principle for the German 
socialists in the case of a Russian attack, even if it is supported by official 
France. The same holds true for Bebe l’s speeches. The people in France who 
use this as a basis for accusations agai nst us belong to that kind who say: 
quod licet Jovi gallici non licet bovi Germanicib; to make them see reason is, 
it seems to me, the task of the Fren ch socialists, and presents no great 
difficulty.c 
I would also warn you that what M. Protot cites from my article is nothing 
but gross falsehood. 
You say that the brochure is well done. I find it very weak; the end, where 
this joker poses as an economist is more than grotesque. If he has a strong 
point, it is the royal disdain which he pours out on his readers. Indeed, one 
must assume that one’s readers are incura ble idiots in order to dare to offer 
them such a collection of palpable falsehoods (in which you see only snippets) 
and lies contradicting one another. Is it then sufficient to put on a masque of 
Dérouléde in order to persuade those who create public opinion in Paris to 
swallow anything one wishes. Has Boulangism 6 survived Boulanger to the 
point of being more powerful than during Boulanger’s lifetime? 
Such a collection of lies and falsehoods is, in fact, irrefutable. It would 
require 3,200 pages to reassert the truth against these 32 pages. There is not a 
single quotation of any significance which is not shamelessly distorted; it was 
only after comparing several texts that I had the measure of M. Protot’s 
affrontery. 
As for the literary style, I find it lamentable, in striking contrast to the 
assiduity with which he has collected his material. Clearly another 
a F. Engels, Socialism in Germany. — b what is acceptable for the French is not acceptable for 
the German - c The following phrases are crossed out in the draft letter: ‘That such chauvinist 
stupidities irritate Guesde I can well believe, but that  is not my fault, nor that of Bebel. As for 
the rest, when I sent my article to Paris, I warn ed my friends of the danger, expressing my fears 
due to national susceptibilities; but I was told th at, on the contrary, this was just what was 
needed’.

hand was at work here. Certainly not Protot. 
Nor is it, as Vorwärts believes, one of the Unabhängiger.a 16 Their mani-
festo (Hans Midler’s Klassenkampf)b is characterised by the lack of care he 
has taken in selecting his supporting texts. 
Nor is it the French police; one senses that they have had a hand in it, 
but they are not the ones who have so interested themselves in the foreign 
policy of the Romanian socialists. 
If M. Protot accuses the latter of bei ng the enemies of Holy Rus, if he 
twice quotes the Bucharest Munca (Labour), and divulges that Nadejde de 
Jassi is ‘Zingaro’,c it is because he is acting in  the interests of the Russian 
embassy, which must have supplied this information, and probably also the 
information on the German socialists, co llected in Berlin by some attaché 
there. 
Thus Protot’s lampoon is not only in the interests of the police, but also in 
the interests of Russia; it is part and parcel of those frantic efforts that Russia 
is making to ensure a French alliance. It is Russia, in fact, which needs 
France. She is so completely exhauste d by the social disorganisation caused 
by the economic transformation that she has been experiencing since 1861, 
by the ravages of deforestation, by the ruination of agriculture and the cottage 
industry, by famine and cholera, that she could not wage a war through to the 
end. Her finances and her credit are in  a state of collapse reminiscent of 
France in 1788; if the western public continues to keep its purse closed, there 
remain only three alternatives: 1) bankruptcy, 2) the convening of a national 
assembly to sanction a new loan, whic h then might succeed in the west; 3) 
war as a measure of desperation— and in that last case France is necessary: 
once war were declared, the French ar my engaged, ten against one, the Tsard 
would reach an agr eement with Williame and Francis Joseph,f who would 
hasten to meet him, and la belle France would pay the expenses of the 
banquet of reconciliation.

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER  
IN VIENNA  
London, 23 October 1892 
Dear Victor, 
There is no need for you to worry about the Trades Unions’ International 
Congress. 24 In the first place the whole business was probably only a device 
for getting the anti-Zurich resolution 27 accepted and might well not even be 
raised by the Parliamentary Committee. 28 Secondly, the attendance of 
individual Continentals is neither here nor there, seeing that even the Paris 
bourse du travail 29—still, if no longer altogether, dominated by the 
Possibilists 30—resolved that the Trades Unions be asked to abandon their 
plan. So who else might one expect to go? Maybe Mr Gilles, as 
representative of the German Independents 16 ?! 
It would be a great help if the Austrian Trades Unions 31 w e r e  t o  s e n d  
their resolution to the Parliamentary Committee. I shall ask Aveling for the 
address which I cannot find. 
Yesterday I walked up Primrose Hill for the first time and, provided I’m 
careful, think I shall have made some slight progress by the end of the week. 
I shall make a note of MacEwen. He is at any rate a CONSULTING  SURGEON 
which means that he can only advise other doctors and not the public direct. 
But I shall find that out. You have no idea of the extent to which everything 
here, including medicine, is governed by etiquette and how one breach of 
that etiquette is infinitely more frowned upon than ten of the sexual code. I 
recall a dictum of the Mancunian Me dico-Ethical Society which sat in 
judgement over my friend Gumpert in Manchester. While paying a visit of 
condolence (this was around 1866-67) to a family who were not his patients, 
he had expressed slight misgivings  about their family doctor’s having 
permitted other children to approach th e bodies of two children who had died 
of scarlet fever. The other doctor lodged a complaint and the verdict was: 
THAT DR GUMPERT HAD COMMITTED A  BREACH OF MEDICAL ETIQUETTE, 
THOUGH HE WAS MORALLY RIGHT! Well, again my best thanks—I shall 
follow your advice. 
Tomorrow I shall again write to Stepniak about his work 32. If you haven’t 
had anything by the end of the fortnight, by 7 or 8 November say,

please write to me again, then I’ll send him a reminder. It’s the only way you 
can get anything out of a Russian. 
I am now on Volume II I of Capital. If, just once during the past four 
years, I had been able to see three cl ear months ahead of me, it would have 
been finished long ago. But I never had any such luck. On this occasion I am 
making time for it by forcibly suppressing and by totally neglecting all my 
correspondence and other concerns. I found that I had made very good 
headway with the most difficult passage the last time I tackled it and up till 
now it’s been going pretty smoothly, though admittedly I have now come up 
against the chief obstacle which has long been standing in my way. 33 But I 
work with a will and, so far, with undiminished vigour and doubtless 
something will come of it this time. 
Herewith a document typical of an archists of Czech nationality. The 
gentlemen are beginning to bludgeon one another with the principle that 
voting is a revolutionary act. I am prepar ed to excuse its deficiencies on the 
grounds that, not being Germans, the louts were not altogether aware of the 
full impact their rhetorical flourishes would have on a German. 
We were all absolutely delighted by the good news about your wife.a We 
hope the improvement will continue and th at before long you will be able to 
send us further glad tidings. 
Warm regards from Louise.b to you, your wife and your children, and the 
same also from

ENGELS TO CHARLES BONNIER 
IN OXFORD 
[Draft] 
London, 24 October 1892 
My dear Bonnier, 
In Le Figaro Guesde says: 
‘Just as Liebknecht stated that , in the case of aggression by France, he would be obliged 
to remember that he is German, we would remi nd the workers’ party, in the case of German 
aggression, that we are French’.  
Thus Guesde and myself are in perfect  agreement, and it is with him that 
you should settle matters. 
You speak of an unfortunate phrase by Bebel—which one? You reproach 
him with so many! If it is the one in Figaro that he would fire at Guesde, it 
belongs to M. Huret; Bebel writes that it existed only in this gentleman’s 
fantasy. 
You talk of preventing war, and you boast of having voted for Domela 34— 
with his plan you would crush all the socialist parties in Europe. 
It is all very fine to speak of preventing a war, from whichever side it 
might come. But why allow yourself to believe in illusions. Do the French 
socialists have some means of preventing the young Williama from declaring 
war in a moment of madness? Can the German socialists forbid Carnot or 
some patriotic ministry to commit a similar folly? Furthermore, if it were 
William or the street-corner revanchists who were the real danger; it is the 
Russian government which is pulling th e strings of these puppets, these by 
hopes, those by fears. So now prevent it from inciting war! 
If war breaks out, those who are defeated will have the opportunity and 
the duty to bring about a revolution—and that’s that.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 3 November 1892 
My dear Lafargue, 
I am plunged up to the eyes in the 3rd Volume of Capital which must be 
completed once and for all. I am working on the least edited and most 
difficult part: banks, credit, etc. 33 I cannot interrupt the work for anything 
whatsoever, otherwise I should have to start from the beginning all over 
again. Hence all my correspondence is interrupted and I can write you only a 
few words. 
It is most unfortunate that you believed in Millevoye’s promises, who 
flouted you like a good politician 36— in future you will know that in politics 
such people pass for GENTLEMEN . I get letter after letter from Germany in 
which they complain about your absen ce at the critical moment and I warn 
you that it will be difficult to have our people undertake work for debates 
from which the principal speaker for whom the work is done absents himself. 
Publication in pamphlet form 9 will not have a hundredth part of the effect of 
a parliamentary speech; that’s a matte r on which our Berlin people are well 
qualified by experience to pronounce. 
The least you might do would be to send a delegate to Berlin on the 14th, 
37 that would enable you to have it out with our people over there. So do try 
to send someone; it’s an expedition that will pay. 
You will have seen the reports in the papers of the ghastly effects, in 
Dahomey, of the new projectiles. 38 A young Viennese doctora who has just 
arrived here (ex-assistant to Not hnagel) saw the wounds made by the 
Austrian projectiles in the Nurmitz strike, and he tells us the same thing. 
There’s no doubt that people in danger of being shot to bits in this manner 
will want to know why. It’s a capital th ing for maintaining peace, but also for 
curbing the so-called revolutionary inclinations, on whose outbursts our 
governments count. The era of barricades and street fighting has gone for 
good; if the military fight, resistance becomes madness.

Hence the necessity to find new revolu tionary tactics. I have pondered over 
this for some time and am not yet settled in my mind. 
I am beginning to go out again a bit. I had nearly three months as a 
prisoner at home; now I am starting to walk, but little and slowly; but at least 
I realise that it will soon be over. And a bout time, as I feel that the lack of 
exercise in the open air must come to  an end. And when I am completely 
restored, we can, I hope, arrange things so that you and Laura give us the 
pleasure of spending a few weeks with us. We have so many things to 
discuss, and it is time Laura saw London again.

Now you ought to take seriously into consideration your impending visit 
to London; we have talked so much about it that at last it ought to be put into 
execution. We all should be so glad to see you here again once more. 
I am in daily expectation of news th at Pumps has had another baby. It’s

I wonder whether Jack Burns did say the nonsense about the foreign

tell you that the work is going more smoothly than I could have hoped; the 
last time I had to break off, I had made good headway and now it’s paying 
dividends. But there still remains a mass of work to do, though I am far

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL  
IN BERLIN 
London, 6 November 1892 
Dear August, 
All this time I have been slaving away dutifully at Volume II P and not, 
I’m glad to say, without success. Today I may already be said to be fairly 
past the main obstacle, the credit system—upon which nothing remains to be 
done but the technical editing—which, however, is of a complex and time-
consuming nature. 33 I have greatly enjoyed the work, firstly because I have 
discovered so many brilliant new sides to it—ask Louise,b to whom I have 
read quite a lot of it out loud—and s econdly because it has also shown me 
that, when all’s said and done, my ol d noddle is still up to the mark, even 
where relatively difficult things are c oncerned. The worst havoc the years 
have wrought is in the sphere of memory whose doors are no longer so easy 
to find or to open, which means a general slowing down. This is something I 
can very well put up with, however. 
But though I may have broken the back of the work, it’s very far from 
finished. Besides this section there still remain the two last ones (rather less 
than 1/3  of the whole) which I haven’t so much as looked at yet, and then 
comes the final, technical editing of the whole which, while not difficult, is 
all the more tedious and wearisome for that. It will probably take me the 
whole of the winter—and then there’ll be the proofs—coinciding with those 
of the 2nd ed., Vol. II .a 
I have made time for it by forcibly suppressing in all my correspon-

dence in so far as it wasn’t absolutely vital. Not my correspondence with 
you, however, although I cannot reply so promptly or in as much detail as I 
should like. Well, you won’t, I suppose, have any objection if it means that 
the Witcha takes up her pen rather more often instead of me. 
Lafargue has still to learn that, amongst bourgeois politicians, promises 
are made only to be broken. 36 In any case his intentions would have been 
frustrated by Standing Orders which pr eclude debate on such questions. He 
is still rather too much of a tyro on the floor of the Chamber; however he has 
promised to frequent it more regularly in future. They now want to publish 
the documents in pamphlet form. 9 
I expressed myself badly in speaking of Hans Müller.b I didn’t mean that 
you, as the Party Executive, should take  any notice of his concoction and still 
less that you should do so in the manner suggested by me. But if a polemic 
against the angry young man was embarked upon under your aegis, then, etc. 
it seems to me absolutely essential that the party should criticise its own 
antecedents on such occasions and th ereby learn to do better. True, the 
blunders committed at the time of the Steamship Subvention, 13 etc., are over 
and done with, but the same people are still around and some, at least, are 
capable of acting as before. It all the blunders perpetrated by the 
parliamentary group and by some of its members are to be concealed under a 
mantle of love, this would, in my opinion, be tantamount to breeding 
Independents. 16 Messrs Frohme, Blos, etc., should acquire a thicker skin. Am 
I wrong in attributing certain motions redolent of ‘Independence’, tabled at 
the Party Congress by the Solingen people, to the latter’s opposition to 
Schumacher’s bourgeoisifica tion and philistinisation? 42 A touch of 
retrospective veracity in the Neue Zeit would do no harm and you, with your 
tact and expertise, would be the right man for the job—but whether, of 
course, your position on the Executive doesn’t make this inadvisable is 
another matter. One way or the other, however, such criticism must 
eventually be expressed. 
It was with pleasure that I read th e report of your Executive last night.c 
Very good. Calm, objective, adhering to the facts which are allowed to speak 
for themselves and only at the end a few necessary brief words denoting 
proud self-confidence. We shall have to see if Aveling can’t get some

cotted out of sheer English chauvinism. The existence in Germany of a labour 
movement with procedures so different from those of the British movement 
and which, though contemptuous of the TRADES UNION and politico-
parliamentary rules here considered sacrosanct, nevertheless goes on from 
strength to strength, is exceedingly galling to people in this country. And I 
don’t mean the middle classes. The old Trades Unions regard each of your 
victories as a defeat for themselves and their own methods. The Fabians 43 are 
riled at your forging ahead despite your having declared war upon all 
bourgeois radicals. The leaders of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION 44 
detest you for refusing either to have secret dealings with them or to join the 
mutual admiration society which Justice has long been trying to make you 
accept, now by dangling a carrot, now by cracking a whip. Because of the 
vast ignorance of the English masses in regard to foreign affairs and their 
hereditary arrogance which leads them to look on a foreigner as a second-rate 
human being and everything occurri ng abroad as of little account, a 
conspiracy of silence is easily imposed. The Chroniclea is in the hands of the 
Fabians where labour matters are concerned, Justice has been led by 
Hyndman to espouse the cause of that rotter Gilles, the Workman’s Times 
likewise believes that nothing’s any good unless based on a big English-style 
TRADES UNION organisation—so where are we to get the thing published? 
Only in the bourgeois press, as a news item of general interest. If, for the 
space of no more than a year, we coul d find a paper willing to open its pages 
to straightforward accounts of the German movement, the whole business 
would come to an end. For there is enough latent internationalism, if 
nurtured, to put paid to the stupid arrogance of the British, at least in the 
majority of cases. But as it is...! 
The Workman’s Times is threatening to close dow n. There’s more to this 
than meets the eye and we’re trying to find out what. Nothing like that 
happens over here without jiggery-pokery of some sort. 
Now ad vocemb Vollmar. As I see it, the man was attacked most ineptly. 
The pitfall in this case was the phrase state socialism. That phrase does not 
express any clear-cut concept but, like ‘social question’, etc., is simply 
journalese, a mere cliché from which anything or nothing may be interred. 
To contest the true meaning of such  a word is sheer waste of time;

for its true meaning consists precisely in its not having any. It would have 
been difficult to avoid examining this supposed concept in the Neue Zeit and 
what K. Kautsky has to say about it is, in fact, very good (except that he too 
supposes that the thing has absolutely got to have a true meaning). 45 But it is 
doing Vollmar an immense and quite unnecessary favour to contend with him 
in political debate about what state socialism is or is not—there’s no end to 
such pointless political palaver. As I see it, what ought to be said at the Party 
Congress is this: ‘My dear Vollmar, what you imagine state socialism to be is 
all one to us, but on various occasions y ou have said such and such about the 
government and our attitude towards it, and that’s where we  have got you; 
what you have said runs just as much counter to the tactics of the party as do 
the pronouncements of the Independents, and it is for this you have got to 
answer! Only on the score of his unashamed arse-crawling to Williama and 
Caprivi is he vulnerable, indeed very much so, and it was to this particular 
point I wished to draw your attention before the Party Congress.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 12 November 1892 
My dear Lafargue, 
You do not tell me where I should address my reply, and so I am sending 
it to Le Perreux. 
Herewith I append a cheque for £20 wh ich you have asked, but I must 
warn you that in the future it will be absolutely impossible for me to make 
good the shortages of funds, let alone the peculations that might occur within 
the French party. Each national party ought to see to its own expenses, and 
one should not hear—in France, above all—this constant complaint that ‘the 
fees are not remitted’. Such kind of thi ngs would never take place if there is 
just a bit of order; a cashier ought to be subject to some kind of control, and 
when he falls ill, he is to be replaced , and he is accountable for receipts and 
expenditures. If some inevitable misfortune assailed you—all right, let it be; 
but paying for such negligence of responsible agents of the party, that’s 
tough indeed! 
But, after all, the fat is in the fire—so much for that! 
I have explained to Bebel the entire affair of Millevoye’sa; it seems as if 
they are calming down on this account; your success at Carmaux and 
elsewhere must have contributed to that. The fruits of your peregrinations 
through France begin to ripen, and all of us are pleased to see the progress 
made in France. Do you realise now what a splendid weapon you in France 
have had in your hands for forty year s in universal suffrage; if only people 
had known how to use it! It’s slower and more boring than the call to 
revolution, but it’s ten times more sure, and what is even better, it indicates 
with the most perfect accur acy the day when a call to armed revolution has to 
be made; it’s even ten to one that unive rsal suffrage, intelligently used by the 
workers, will drive the rulers to overthrow legality, that is, to put us in the 
most favourable position to make the revolution. We should reach a new 
stage in the 1893 elections, and then there will

be that union between Socialists of different shades of opinions of which 
Liebknecht never stops talking. That union will come about as soon as there 
is a score of Socialists in the Chamber; if our people have—as I hope—a 
majority, they will be able to dictate terms. In the meantime, go on with your 
‘victories and conquests’, and you will find that it is the Germans who will 
applaud you the most warmly.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 19 November 1892 
Dear August, 
This time your Party Congress 51 didn’t go off as brilliantly as it did on the 
last occasion. The debate on the que stion of salary leaves a very 
a 17 November  
=====第59页=====
Letters- 1892 33 
nasty taste in one’s mouth—not that I think the English or French would have 
done any better in that respect—though Louise refuses to admit as much. As 
I know from long experience, what we are up against here is one of the 
limitations imposed upon the outlook of  working men by the conditions 
under which they have lived hitherto. The same people who think it perfectly 
natural for their idol Lassalle to have a private income and live the life of a 
consummate sybarite are denouncing Liebknecht for wanting, as their paid 
editor, barely one-third of that sum, although the paper yields them five or six 
times as much. 52 To be dependent, even on a labour party, is a hard lot. And, 
quite aside from the question of money, it’s a most otiose position for anyone 
with any initiative to  be editor of a paper belongi ng to the party. Marx and I 
were always agreed that we would never accept such a position and that the 
only paper we could have was one that was not financially dependent even on 
the party itself. 
If taken too far, your ‘nationalisation’ of the press 53 would have very 
material drawbacks. It’s absolutely essential for you to have a press in the 
party which is not directly dependent on the Executive or even the Party 
Congress, i.e. which is in a position unreservedly to oppose individual party 
measures within the programme and accepted tactics, and freely to criticise 
that programme and those tactics, within the limits of party decorum. As the 
Party Executive, you people ought to encourage a press of this nature—
indeed initiate it, for you would then exert far more moral sway over it than if 
it were to come into being partly against your will. The party is outstripping 
the strict discipline of earlier days; with 2 or 3 millions and an influx of 
‘heddicated’ elements, more latitude is needed than what has hitherto not 
only sufficed but actually proved a useful restraint. The sooner you people 
adapt yourselves and the party to this changed situation the better. And the 
first step is a formally independent party press. It is bound to come about but 
it would be better if you were to allow it to come about in such a way that it 
remains under your moral sway from the outset and does not arise in 
opposition to yourselves. 
You people blundered badly—not in Berlin but at Brussels 54— over the 
question of the May Day celebrations. You must have known at the time 
what you could promise and perform, and yet you went and promised more 
than you are now able to perform. I c onsider your own speech on the subject 
no whit inferior to Victor’s and readily believe that a stoppage of work in 
Germany would demand sacrifices out of all proportion to victories and 
gains. 55 But when the strongest party in the world suddenly 
=====第60页=====
34 Letters- 1892 
sounds a retreat in this way, the general impression this produces is very bad. 
Noblesse oblige. You are the fighting force, the corps de bataille of the 
modern labour movement and, what you promised in Brussels, you were 
morally bound to do. Now, while it is undoubtedly better not to follow up 
one stupidity with another, far greater one—granted the crucial importance 
just now is not to interrupt the German party’s victorious progress—you 
should nevertheless consider what kind of impression this Berlin resolution is 
going to make on the world at large. The affair would also seem to have 
aroused indignation in France and th e chaps there will doubtless be giving 
you a piece of their mind. You cannot affo rd to inflict such moral injury upon 
yourselves again—so in Zurich you must have the courage of your 
convictions and declare outright that you cannot commit yourselves to a 
stoppage of work; then, though people may be angry with you, they will not 
be able to reproach you with breaking your word and beating a retreat. 56 It is 
nonsensical to try and organise the m ovement uniformly in each individual 
country. The Austrians, to whom a stoppage of work on May Day is 
necessary, and who are accordingly prepar ed to make those very sacrifices 
which you rightly repudiated in your particular circumstances, are as justified 
in acting as they do as you were; now, however, they can make reproaches to 
which you can offer no answer. For by their very conduct they have proved 
that the impossibility clause laid down at Brussels does not apply. 
We over here have not yet had the state socialism debate. 
I must congratulate you on your resolutions. They are really first-rate and 
I know of only one person who could ha ve improved on them, namely Marx. 
The resolution on state socialism, like that on anti-Semitism, hits the nail on 
the head. And it is precisely resolutions of this kind that have in the past been 
the Achilles’ heel of the German movement; they have been sloppy, 
indeterminate, nebulous and cliché-ridden—in short, for the most part a 
disgrace. Fortunately they are so untrans latable that anyone translating them 
into a foreign language is compelled to read into them a meaning which they 
themselves do not possess. 
Below is a theatre drawn by Louise or Aveling. For the past week the 
page thus embellished has been repeat edly placed amongst my writing paper, 
which is why it now has the honour of finding its way to you. 57

of London—the Fabians 43 of the Chroniclea—about the Party Congress. The 
poor souls are in a mess. The great Shaw, having in May urged upon you the 
necessity of collusion with the Liberals and demonstrated that, failing such a 
policy, nothing could result but defeat and disgrace 59, now admits in a speech 
to the Democratic Club that they have been scandalously done in the eye by 
the Liberals and that all they had r eaped on the occasion of the elections 
was—defeat and disgrace; also that the Liberals, together with the Tories, are 
now out to do the workers in the eye! And these are the people who propose 
to teach you ‘practical politics’! In fact  he now actually says that the two old 
parties have but one and the same policy and that, barring them, there is 
nothing but—Social Democracy! This will, I think, have the effect of a cold 
douche on our good Ede.b Cordial regards to your wife and all the friends.

box that Emile de Girardin’s file of dossiers, from which issued ‘a scandal a 
day’, was for the July Monarchy. 61 As long as this goes on, I think your 
place is in Paris, in the Chamber, at the centre of the news, to put yourself, 
and keep yourself, in touch with what is happening and in particular with 
what emerges from one day to the next. Every fresh piece of scandal which is 
brought to light will be a weapon for us . It’s time I was done with the 3rd 
volumea the close of the century is more and more charged with electricity. 
I’m glad to say it’s going passably well (I mean the work on the 3rd volume) 
and I hope to finish it during the winter. The greatest difficulty has been 
overcome. 
Sam Moore has just left us. He is going to spend the greater part of his 
leave in the country with his parents and will be back in January. We shall 
see him again next Sunday.b 
If I am not mistaken I have already told you that Pumps had a little girl on 
the 13th—both are doing well. 
For the last few days I have been well enough again to go out for a quarter 
of an hour; I hope this will help to restore me altogether. 
The Germans have committed a fine bl under over May Day; not in Berlin, 
but in Brussels. 34 They ought to have reserved the right, at the International 
Congress, to celebrate the day in their own way and according to 
circumstances. Their withdrawal creates a deplorable impression and should 
you give them a good wigging, you’ll be doing no more than your duty. Any 
other party could have allowed itself th is retrogressive move; they, in their 
position as the main body of the European army, could not make it without 
great prejudice to the movement as a whole. I entirely approve the reasons 
which decided them in Berlin: the harm, to them, of a stoppage of work 
would have been out of all proportion to the advantages to them; but that 
should have been foreseen, and they s hould have had the courage at Brussels 
not to vote for a stoppage.  
And what of Laura? When do we see her here? Kiss her for me.

ENGELS TO JULIE BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 29 November 1892 
Dear Mrs Bebel, 
Of all the letters I got on my birthday, yours is the first I feel impelled to 
answer. My most sincere thanks. I spent the day ‘in the best of health’, for, 
even though I am not in full control of my movements and cannot walk as 
much as I should like to, I nevertheless feel quite robust and everyone says I 
look very well. This time we turned my birthday into an English May Day 
celebration, i.e. we brought it forward from the Monday to the previous 
Sunday.a Louise felt that, as I couldn’t fa il to tipple somewhat on an occasion 
like this, one day would be enough and two days too many. We had a real 
houseful, our African, Sam Moore, also Bax, the Avelings, Bernsteins, 
Mottelers, the Russian Volkhovsky, and two working men from the Society 
62 ; that, I think, was all. No. I nearly forgot little Inkab who has really filled 
out on the food she gets in Berlin and whose plumpness suits her very well—
now I have tangible proof that people have learned how to eat their fill in 
Berlin and let no one speak to me in future about starving Berlin! 
We still had a small supply of dried woodruff and so Louise and I con-
cocted a May cup with the aid of Moselle, red wine and champagne—at this 
foggy time of year it would hardly be possible to imagine, let alone 
a 27 November - b Inka Fischer

brew, anything better. Since one and all had laid a good foundation in the 
shape of a cold meal, the said cup was valiantly attacked, not least by Your 
Humble Servant, the Narrator and, strictly between ourselves, several of the 
gentlemen, among them—I was about to say it but shall stop before it’s too 
late—became somewhat the worse for wear. Juliusa was in great form; he 
sang various songs and told funny stories though, with his customary 
obstinacy, indulged in nothing but water or coffee. In short, we were all very 
jolly until past midnight, which is saying a great deal, considering the 
distances here in London and the fact that all railway and omnibus services 
close down after 11 o’clock on Sunday night. And so I was able to retire to 
bed secure in the knowledge that I had entered my 73rd year in a worthy 
fashion. However I hope that my health  will allow me to do even better next 
year. Then my birthday falls on a Tuesday, and so we shall again be able to 
make a start on Sunday, though in that case I should like to carry on 
carousing until Tuesday night. 
I should like to have attended that beanfeast in Berlin. Inka tells me that 
she could not get through to you and Be bel because of the crush so there 
must have been an enormous number present. 63 Still, I don’t doubt that I’ll 
witness something of that kind again, if not this year then the next, provided 
that is, you come over and fetch us. The little Fischer girl sees in you so great 
a mental affinity with my dear good Lenchen that I can be doubly confident 
in placing myself in your charge. 
As August left only one measly page for your use, I shall reverse the 
position and he will get only one from me. 
With warm regards 
Yours,

Dear August, 
Many thanks for your good wishes—I stood the whole thing very well and 
without any evil after-effects whatever, nor should I be in any way averse to 
celebrating yet another birthday tomorrow—but so strict a watch is kept on 
me that I should never be allowed to i ndulge in such excesses! Your Prussian 
police are as nothing by comparison with a medical Witcha like this. But I 
always keep wondering what good it will do and what are the sins that have 
earned me such conscientious surveillance. Being unable to rid myself of a 
silly superstitious belief in ‘equalising justice’, I am drinking mineral water 
and lemonade and doing penance for the aforesaid sins without knowing 
whether I have actually committed them . More about politics in my next—in 
a day or twob—but I must see to it that I finish Volume II I.C In France things 
look remarkably tempestuous; c’est le commencement de la find! The time 
will again come when the French will have an oppor tunity to show their good 
qualities.

victory in the Mainz elections. 69 You Mainz people sometimes tend to be

gas-bags—born wine salesmen—but when it comes to the point you can also 
buckle to and move mountains, and it w ill always be remembered in your 
favour that Mainz was the only German city to play an honourable role 
during the great revolution. 70 Nature gave you the gift of the gab which is 
just what is wanted when it comes to working on the peasants, the more so in 
that you have in the wine grower s round about you a great quantity of 
material to work on. If you address yourself energetically to the task, you 
will be able to achieve something and show the Cologne people how it’s 
done. From Mainz to Cologne and down to Cleve there’s still many a poor 
soul to be snatched away from the priests and still many a constituency to be 
won, and this is precisely the moment when the gentlemen of the Centre 71 
are on the point either of thoroughly compromising themselves over the 
military question or of leading the entire Centre up the garden path. 
Apart from that, I should like to send you my best thanks and to say how 
glad I am that you had been keeping well and have been feeling even ‘better’ 
since. I too am keeping well. We had the whole Brimstone Gang 72 here on 
Sunday and a few more besides, a ll of whom vigorously addressed 
themselves to the wine cup.a 
If we have a few more of these scandals in Paris 60, we may soon be able 
to re-enact the old comedy of autumn ‘47 in Brussels; the world is beginning 
to look shaky.

ENGELS TO NATALIE AND WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BERLIN 
London, 1 December 1892 
Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
My best thanks for your kind note and good wishes for my seventy-second 
birthday which we celebrated last Sunday amidst the usual circle of friendsa 
all of whom remained until the 28th had actually dawned! Winter seems to 
have set in really early over there if you have already been blessed with snow 
and a temperature of 10 degrees R. We don’t have such extremes, but rather 
content ourselves with a pleasing alterna tion of rain and fog, getting more of 
both than we should like. 
Unfortunately it was not possible to send off this letter in time to give your 
Willyb my greetings on his birthday. I tr ust you will be so good as to accept 
these belated wishes. I thought it probable that your Theodorc to whom, as 
also to Karl,d please convey my sincere thanks for the good wishes, would be 
able to take a break from his tedious week in Mittenwald by spending a 
Sunday with you, and I’m glad to see that this was in fact so. The best of 
luck to your Karl with his exams. 73 I, who never passed an exam in my life, 
can nevertheless well imagine how a young man must feel three months 
before such an event. 
The Stadthagen affair has shown that they are still perfectly capable of 
persecuting us even without the Anti-Socialist Law. 15 That the debate on 
salary at the Party Congress 52 has caused your family great annoyance I can 
well believe, but that kind of thing is inevitable in public life. Not everyone 
is as eager as the German Reichstag to vote grants; in other countries even 
ministers and, on occasion, crowned h eads no less, must expose themselves 
to unpleasantnesses of this kind. It is a case of everyone trying to prove that 
‘where money begins, benevolence ends’. 74 On the other hand, Liebknecht 
enjoyed a well-earned trium ph with the Ems Despatch, 75 which makes up for 
a good deal, and then again his trip to Marseilles was an ovation from start to 
finish. 5

Dear Liebknecht, 
You will have to wait a little while for the sequel to this, as Volume II P 
admits of no delay. In France it almost seems as though we are back in ‘47, 
and Panama 60 could well put paid to all the bourgeois cochonnerie.b The 
scandals of 1847 and of the Second Empire are trivial by comparison. Do 
write and tell your Paris correspondents to keep you informed about it and to 
send you the material in newspapers—these are matters you must pursue in 
person.

ENGELS TO LUDWIG SCHORLEMMER 
IN DARMSTADT 
London, 1 December 1892 
My dear Schorlemmer, 
My sincere thanks for your kind good wishes for a day that was happily 
spent.a Though I may not actually be fit for active service in the ‘glorious 
army’ as I enter on another year of my life, I am nevertheless in good health 
and, on the whole, robust and I think you are right in saying that for the time 
being I shall continue to pull my weight. 
To go by your latest information on Anschutz, it would certainly be best if 
we were to hear no more of him. Ol d Pflüger—a nephew of mine used to 
work in his laboratory—is, so far as I can judge, a real philistine and if, on 
top of that, Anschütz’s father was a Pru ssian officer, that makes matters even 
worse, The fact is that it will be difficult to find the right man for Carl’sb 
biography, one who is not only a chemist but also a Social Democrat, and not 
only a Social Democrat but also a chem ist and, what’s more, a chemist who 
has made a close study of the history of his discipline since Liebig’s day. 
Presumably we shall have to wait and see whether we can find that man or 
whether we must content ourselves with the two aspects of Carl being treated 
separately. I myself must above all else finally complete Volume II I of 
Capital and cannot see how I could break off just now—and on top of that 
there are also the proofs of the 2nd edition of Volume II ! 
And then, too, we live in very turbulent times, what with the military 
affair, 76 the impending crisis in Germany, the Panama scandals 60 and the 
crisis that has already set in in France as well as the crisis over Ireland that 
will almost certainly occur over here next spring. 77 In times like these my 
correspondence increases twofold and threefold and if, on top of everything 
else, one is forbidden on account of one’s eyes to wield a pen by lamplight, 
how can one possibly manage? And as fo r daylight here in London in winter! 
We’re glad if we get four or five hours of it and often there’s none at all—
gaslight all day because of the fog.

ENGELS TO CHARLES BONNIER 78 
IN OXFORD 
[Draft] 
[London, 3 December 1892] 
My dear Bonnier, 
Es wird nichts so heiss ge gessen, wie es gekocht wird.a You have the ad-
mirable habit of serving warm, very warm, but would I not sometimes risk 
burning my lips? The newspaper, as you know, is not yet being published. 48 
You ask me to convey to the Germans a kind of ultimatum from the 
French. If I undertake to do so, will you guarantee that, in reply to a direct 
query by Berlin to Paris, Paris without disavowing me entirely would not say 
that I had exaggerated. 
a If you don’t cool it, you’ll not be able to drink it.

Letters- 1892 47 
As to the core of your ultimatum: 
1) let us first see what will happen here between now and 1st May, and 
what will happen this 1st May. 
2) Between May and August a number of things might happen before 
Zurich 56 which cannot today be anticipated, 
3) and, all the more so, between August 1893 and May 1894. 
With the military question in Germany, 76 with Panama 60 in France, with 
the Irish complication in England 77—three acute imminent political crises—
with an industrial crisis everywhere, it seems to me that we could put our 
time to better use than quarrelling over how to mark 1st May, 1894, a day on 
which, perhaps, we will have better things to do than ‘demonstrate’! 
As for your perennial Protot, I couldn’t care less about him, any more than 
about his fellows, the agents-provocateu rs of the German police. When will 
you adopt a similar attitude? 
In any case, it seems to me rather odd that you are prepared to allow the 
English to disregard the resolutions of Brussels 54 but them alone. 79 What 
will French logic say to that?a 
As for the rest I know only one party which has the right to reproach the 
Berlin Congress. 51 That is the Austrian party. 81 Until now 1st May in Berlin 
has been worth far more than those in Paris. 
I am writing today to Bebel.b I will tell him of your ultimatum, but for the 
moment only as your personal opinion.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 3 December 1892 
Dear August, 
I was delighted by what you said in your letter of the 22nd about the 
disinclination you people feel for any further ‘nationalisation’ of the party 
press. 82 So there’s no need to waste any more words on the subject. 
As regards the May Day celebrations, I concede that you were perfectly 
right so far as the Berlin resolution was concerned. But the fact remains that 
the general impression you produced in Brussels was that in future you too 
would celebrate on 1 May and not invoke the permission not to do so that 
was granted purely by way of an exception.^ So you shouldn’t be surprised 
by the hullabaloo to which the Berlin resolution has given rise. But your 
intention of getting Congress to settle on Sunday as the day on which 
celebrations should be held in future is likely to hit on some snags. Except 
for the English everyone will be against it, many of the smaller parties out of 
sheer bravado. It would be a sorry retreat and the last people to join in its 
official proclamation would be those who secretly reserve the right to do 
likewise, whether it was proclaimed or not. 
Well, yesterday evening I got a rabid letter from Bonnier (he never writes 
any other kind) in which, having read your article in the Neue Zeit, 83 he 
declares in the name of the French that, if the first Sunday in May were to be 
adopted, they would drop the whole business of May Day. ‘ Jamais,’ he 
writes, ‘notre parti n’acceptera (le dimanc he) et nous sommes bien décidés à 
tenir ferme.’’a And he believes you people are playing with fire. 
I wrote and told himb 1. that things are never as black as he paints them, 2. 
asking who had authorised him to speak in the name of the French party, 3. 
that before May 1893, and between then and August ‘93 in Zurich 56 and 
between then and May ‘94 much might happen 
a Our party would never agree (to the Sunday) a nd we are fully determined to stand firm. - b See 
this volume, Letter 28  
=====第75页=====
Letters- 1892 49 
that we didn’t expect and that, with 3 acute political crises in the offing 
(Army in Germany, 76 Panama in France 60 Ireland in England 77) and a 
general industrial crisis, we probably had better things to do than bicker 
about how best to demonstrate on 1 May ‘94, when we might have work of a 
very different nature to do; 4. how his proposal to allow the English, and 
them only, to celebrate on the Sunday chimed in with French logic; 5. that I 
knew of only one party—the Austrian 81—which had any right to reproach 
the Germans, that the May Day celebrations in Berlin more than made 
amends for those in Paris and 6. that I had passed on his ultimatum to you, 
but purely as his own private opinion.  
The man is consumed by an irrepressible urge to be up and doing but, such 
being the case, he shouldn’t have gone to  Oxford where he is all on his own 
with red Wolffa who is completely out of everything. It’s a priceless idea, 
wanting to direct the European labour movement from Oxford—the last 
genuine remnant of the Middle Ages still to be found in Europe—but for us it 
makes an infuriating amount of unnecessa ry work and I shall protest in no 
mean terms to Paris about this go-between. The really unfortunate thing is 
that he’s the only person who understands  German save for Laura, and she 
lives out of town. 
For the rest, the Party Congress went off quite well, but subscribing to the 
resolution 84 despite the sundry rubbish it contains, must have been a bitter 
pill for Vollmar to swallow. 
Ede came to see me, bringing with him a whole bunch of letters from K. 
Kautsky—who had also written to me—all of them concerned with the Neue 
Zeit, and wanting me to add my mite. My  opinion is that, if you accept the 
change proposed by Dietz, you should think it out and prepare for it properly, 
and not go ahead till January, otherwise it will be altogether premature. 85 But 
speaking generally, I should say that, since becoming a weekly, the Neue Zeit 
has to some extent relinquished its old character in favour of a new one 
which it has not been completely successful in assuming. The paper is now 
being written for two sets of readers and cannot do full justice to either. 
If it is to become a popular, part-po litical, part-literary and artistic and 
part-learned journal, à la Nation, then it will have to move to Berlin. The 
political section of a weekly must  be written at the hub of things, on the eve 
of publication, otherwise it will always be lagging behind. And, 
a Ferdinand Wolff  
=====第76页=====
50 Letters- 1892 
save for the correspondents, those wo rking on the political section must 
always be in the same place. The idea of editing a review in Berlin and 
London and publishing it in Stuckert a doesn’t seem feasible to me. In any 
case there would be a 20 or 30 per cent difference in subscriptions between a 
Berlin and a Stuttgart weekly. I am regarding this simply from a bookselling 
point of view, having no more than a nodding acquaintance with the other 
aspects that need to be considered and about which you out there will be 
better informed than I. 
But if the Neue Zeit undergoes these changes, it will appeal to only one 
section of its former public and will have to be organised solely for their 
benefit. It would then no longer be open to those articles from which it has 
hitherto derived its greatest and most enduring value—the longer, learned 
papers which run on through 3 to 6 numbers. Hence, alongside the Neue Zeit 
there would have to be a predominantly learned monthly— if necessary even 
quarterly—journal with a correspondingly restricted circle of subscribers, and 
this would have to be offset by raising the price if the paper was to be kept 
going. 
Indeed, it seems to me altogether necessary, if the party publishers wish 
increasingly to secure a monopoly of party publications, including learned 
ones, that they should not aim at bulk sales for everything, whether suitable 
for that purpose or not. An original  paper on political economy is bound to 
be primarily a detailed treatise, nor can it be expected to sell in bulk. 
Similarly, a genuine historical work, the outcome of independent research, 
does not lend itself to publication by installments. In short, I think there 
should be two separate departments,  one for bulk sales, the other for 
ordinary, slower-moving sa les through booksellers, in smaller quantities and 
at a correspondingly higher price. 
What happens when an attempt is made to boost sales beyond the limits 
called for by the nature of the case is something I have learned from my own 
experience. Though written as popularly as possible, my Anti-Dühring is by 
no means a book to suit every working man. But along comes Dietz, takes 
over part of the Zurich edition and then tries to boost sales by remaindering 
the thing at a reduced price with 11 assorted booksellers. This is not at all to 
my liking and next time I shall be on my guard. It is the only longer work I 
have written since 1845 and, whichever 
a Stuttgart  
=====第77页=====
Letters- 1892 51 
way one looks at it, it is degrading to see it treated in that way. By the by, 
there’s no need to say anything to Dietz about this—the thing is over and 
done with and cannot be altered, nor w ould I have mentioned it to you had it 
not provided an apt illustration of what  I mean by the wrong way of selling 
books. 
For the rest, times are growing criti cal. Every morning when I read the 
Daily News and such French papers as have arrived, it takes me right back to 
‘47. At that time, too, one expected some further scandalous revelations each 
morning and one was seldom di sappointed. The Panama affair 60 beats 
everything that went on in the way of corruption under Louis-Philippe and 
under Bonaparte II I. The initial outlay,  including bonifications to the press 
and Parliament, amounted to 83 million francs. This will be the ruin of the 
bourgeois republic, for the Radicals 86 are as deeply im plicated as the 
Opportunists. 87 On every side attempts are being made to hush things up, of 
course, but the more they are hushe d up the worse they get. Once the 
revelations were under way and a fe w people had become irretrievably 
implicated in the scandal, these ha d perforce to cover themselves by 
betraying their accomplices and showi ng that they had only been swimming 
with the stream. Already the committee is in possession of such enormously 
compromising statements th at there’s no holding back; a few may slip 
through the net, but large numbers have already been named and, of course, 
the fewer the names that are compromised the great er the odium that attaches 
to the bourgeois republic. Though much may still happen in the meantime, 
this is nevertheless the beginning of the end. Fortunately all the monarchist 
parties are completely done for, nor will it be at all easy to find another 
Boulanger. 6 
Herewith an extract from Lafargue’s letter for the Vorwärts —but do 
ensure that the paper gives no indication whatsoever  that the letter emanated 
from a deputy. 88 
What Liebknecht entirely overlooked in the matter of Bismarck’s Ems 
forgery was that that’s the sort of thing diplomats do in secret but never boast 
about. 75 But if one of them does happen to boast about it, the breach of 
etiquette is such as to render him persona non grata. After this it will never 
again be possible to appoint Mr Bismarck Imperial Chancellor, otherwise any 
foreign government could refuse to enter into negotiations with a man who 
not only is not above using such methods, but actually boasts of having used 
them. The Imperial Government would risk incur-

again. I believe it would do a lot of good if this were said on the floor of the 
Reichstag.

[Postscript from Louise Kautsky]  
Dear August,  
It seems to be my fate that my space should be rationed because I once over-stepped the 
mark and wrote a leader, so rather than look at  your last letter, I shall look instead at the 
pretty inkstand that invites kind, happy thought s and was inaugurated with the proofs of the 
second volume of Capital. Thank you very much for it—how good you both are; now that 
I’m equipped, I am, it seems, likely to run on and to be rapped over the knuckles for so 
doing. Well, that isn’t what I was intending to write about—all I meant to say was that not 
once this week have I been able to get round to  writing, there having been, alas, so much to 
prevent me—glass-workers, trans port workers, Reumann, Victor,b meeting of the 
unemployed and, last but not least, the Jews. They are not getting the Vorwärts, August, so 
could you please make inquiries? Then, some tim e ago, I asked if you could let me have 
another copy of the Vorwärts’ report on the Congress, but you probably forgot—I’d like two 
if at all possible, otherwise one; it’s the re port on the Party Conference I want, not the one 
made by you people at the Conference. Victor enjoyed the time he spent with you and wrote 
saying that to him it seemed as though the poor Austrians were standing guard in the wet and 
the cold, whereas you people were sitting snug in  your encampment, despite the struggle and 
the fighting. Then there’s another thing—I still have two English reports on the International 
Glassworkers’ Congress 89 to spare. Would you like one? It’s very interesting, but you would 
have to write a few lines about it by way of justification and send a sample copy, and would 
you please ask Fischer if he might perhaps write  something for a Bavarian paper, in which 
case I would send him the other copy. I would,  of course, send them without any strings 
attached but I feel responsible because it’s the English who have  to pay for the whole thing, 
so I’d be grateful if you’d let me know. I must close, so more anon; it’s time for the post and 
I must close.  
With loving kisses to you and Julie, 
the Witch

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 4 December 1892 
Dear Baron, 
My best thanks for your good wishes in respect of a day that was spent 
very happily. Alas, tippling still does not agree with me and I shall have to 
atone for it by abstaining for the next few weeks. 
Thank you, too, for sending the prospectus for the new journal—do you 
know the chaps 91 ? I have never heard of any of them. 
I haven’t yet been able so much as to look at Schmidt’s latest on the rate 
of profita since, until Volume II Ib is finished, I shall have to fend off 
everything that might entail extra work—there being far too many inter-
ruptions as it is. 
As for the Neue Zeit, 85 Edec and I have discussed it at length, and 
yesterday I wrote a long letterd to August on the subject. 
It is my opinion that if, as proposed by Dietz and August, the Neue Zeit is 
to be given a lighter, more popular tone and made ‘more interesting’ from a 
literary point of view, it will have to move to Berlin. For only there can a 
political review covering all events up to the eve of publication be catered for 
on the spot and only there can a wealth of artistic and literary work, which 
would otherwise come a week too late, be produced

with speed and ‘immediacy’. This and other circumstances would mean that 
a Berlin edition would have 20 or 30 per cent more subscribers than a 
Stuttgart one. 
But in that case the Neue Zeit would have to sacrifice the better part of its 
contents—and the latter would call for a monthly or quarterly of a more 
rigorously learned nature than hither to and which, because intended for a 
smaller public, would have to be sold at a higher price.  
But what if neither is feasible? In that case—and this has only just oc-
curred to me—it might perhaps be better to turn the Neue Zeit back into a 
monthly but with the same capacity as at present, i.e. 104 sheets a year and 
8-9 a month. The longer articles could then appear in one, or at most 2, 
numbers and would, in the second case, have  to be subdivided into I, II  or I, 
II , II I, IV installments which would be conducive to their general 
intelligibility. With 2 sheets a month it’s impossible to break off longer 
articles at the point the sense requires, since this would almost invariably be 
precluded by considerations of space and diversity. But in this way you could 
train your contributors to divide up their things themselves into 2 
installments. And then there could be ‘something for everyone’ in every 
number. But here again, you would have  to reckon on a reduced circulation, 
and hence be obliged to raise the pr ice—or so at least it seems to me. 
At all events, before making any experiments you should consider the 
matter carefully. Once made, a false step is difficult to reverse. 
If the weekly Neue Zeit were to move to Berlin it would, in many respects, 
replace the weekly central organ which might otherwise hol d out for another 
year. Between now and then a great deal may happen. Things are livening up. 
It looks as though the Panama scandal 60 might mark a turning-point so far as 
the development of France is concerne d. You should pester Lafargue about 
collecting material for a longish essay on the subject, or supplying you with 
articles as each particular phase of the scandal reaches its climax. With that 
sort of material the Neue Zeit would be able to outstrip the dailies even in the 
matter of factual news. 
As for the Vorwärts —the less said the better!

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 5 December 1892 
My dear Lafargue, 
Your remarks concerning Bebel compel me to refer back to your letter 
from Lille. 93 What you say about him is unfair in the extreme. Far from 
Liebknecht correcting Bebel on any matte r whatsoever (an amusing idea to 
anyone who understands the situation), it’s precisely the contrary that is 
taking place. It is Liebknecht who is promising wonders, and if the whole 
thing doesn’t collapse and dissolve, it’s thanks to the work Bebel is doing. If 
Liebknecht said only agreeable things to  you at Marseilles, don’t forget that 
this is how he behaves with everyone; 5 that he always acts on the impulse of 
the moment and that consequently he says white here today, but tomorrow 
somewhere else he will say black, and he  will maintain in all good faith that 
he has not contradicted himself. You complain about the Berlin resolution 
concerning May 1st, 54 well and good, according to our German press, 
Liebknecht is reported to have said that at Marseilles he explained the 
position to you, including the impossibility for the Germans to stop work on 
May 1st; and that ‘the French’ had fully acknowledged the force of his 
arguments. If that is true, by what right do you complain of the Berlin 
resolution? If Liebknecht has erred (for he  believes what he says), what have 
=====第82页=====
56 Letters- 1892 
you to say of the man who, accord ing to you, ‘corrects’ Bebel? 
I fear that behind all this lies the dissatisfaction of our Oxford hermit.a If 
his impulsive nature makes him unjust to Bebel, who is an ironic and 
business-like character, the heat he is generating during his compulsory 
activity in the heart of the only city in the world where the Middle Ages 
continue in full swing, will drive this aversion to the point of hatred. As it is, 
I never get a letter from him which does not teem with abuse of Bebel. I 
grant all that, I give full recogniti on to the hermit’s good faith and goodwill, 
but firstly an enthusiast of that kind is a dangerous guide in matters of 
practical life, particularly when he lives in the isolation of Oxford, consumed 
by the desire to do something for the movement. And it’s not just something 
to do that he needs, but positively something important and decisive. You 
know how he pestered us over the paper. 48 The day before yesterday he sent 
me a veritable ultimatum in the name of the French Party (he always speaks 
in its collective name) addressed to the German Party: if the Germans at 
Zurich propose the postponing of the May celebrations to the first Sunday, 
the French will withdraw from the dem onstration altogether, and there will 
be, if not war, at least something like the breaking off of diplomatic 
relations—and goodness knows what else. Anyhow he warns the Germans 
‘that they are playing with fire’. However, his French logic allows him to add 
that if the English insist on demonstrating on the Sunday, the French would 
see no harm in it! 
I answered him fairly ironically that I would communicate his ultimatum 
to Bebel, but only as his personal opinion.b 
Naturally I don’t take Bonni er’s explosions for the attitude of the French 
Party; on the contrary, even if you authorised him I should not do so; I know 
him to be quite incapable—with the best will in the world—of expressing 
other people’s ideas and words without putting in his own. He can’t help it; 
like Liebknecht, he only knows two shades, black and white; he either loves 
or hates; and as he cannot love Bebel, he needs must hate him. But you 
would be monstrously wrong to form your view of the German movement 
according to his. Laura being in the country cannot gainsay all the gossip 
about the Germans, and it’s a great pity that he is the only one of you all who 
understands German.

Have you seen his ‘Moment’? There are poems in it (Heine’s 
Poesiemusik,a die Instrumental- und Vokalpoesie die keine Musik istb), poems 
on Germany; that ‘unfathomable’ and extremely chaotic Germany which has 
never existed outside Victor Hugo’s imagination. The Germany which was 
supposed to be preoccupied only with music, dreams and clouds, and which 
left the care of matters here below to the French bourgeois and journalists. 
This good fellow would but speak of oaks, of forests, of students with scars 
on the face, of Gretchen and other play things—and this after having lived in 
a country which is today the most prosaic and workaday in the world. Do 
read all that, and if then you believe a single word of what he has to say about 
Germany, it will be your fault. 
Besides, you may remember that recen tly, as you needed documents with 
respect to Liebknecht, it was Bebel who immediately set himself to work for 
you, while Liebknecht—though it concerned him closely—would but 
confine himself to sending several newspapers to you. 
Enough of that. Had it not been to destroy the false judgements about the 
most perspicacious, the most sensible and the most energetic man in the 
German party, I would not have written to you at such length. I wanted to

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 5 December 1892 
My dear Löhr, 
It’s a long time yet till April, but if it cannot be managed otherwise, well 
then we must submit and only consider the matter finally settled, affaire 
bâclée, that you celebrate, both of you, your silver wedding here. And maybe 
you may manage a few days with us in the meantime, at all events we will 
consider that an open question still. 
If you do not receive this week the Arbeiterinnenzeitung please let us 
know; Louise will write again. The pa per having been handed over to the 
women altogether has probably cause d some irregularities which will soon 
be set right. 
Ah le Panama! 60 I can tell you I am 45 years younger again, and living 
through a second ‘47. Then La Presse (Girardin’s) brought every day a fresh 
revelation about some scandal. 61 or some other paper brought a reply to some 
charge of his; and this went on till it killed Louis Philippe. But those 
scandals, and even those of the Second Empire dwindle into nothingness 
compared with this Grand Nationa l Steeplechase of Scandals. Louis 
Bonaparte took jolly good care, when he coaxed the peasants’ money out of 
their buried hoards, to do so for the benefit of his State loans, which were 
safe; but here the savings of the sma ll tradesman, the peasant, the domestic 
servant and above all of the petit rentier,a the loudest howler of all, have 
gone into irretrievable ruin, and the miracle has been performed of 
transforming a canal which has not been dug out, into an unfathomable 
abyss. 1,500 million francs, 60 milli on pounds sterling, all gone, gone for 
ever, except what has found its way into the pockets of swindlers, politicians 
and journalists; and the money got together by swindles and corrupt dodges 
unequalled even in America. What a base of operations for a Socialistic 
campaign! 
The  thing  has  evidently  been  based   upon  its  own  immensity.

Everybody considered himself safe becau se everybody else was as deeply in 
it. But that is just what now makes hushing up impossible; partial disclosures 
having set in, the innumerable receivers of ‘boodle’ (for here American is the 
only possible language) are by their very numbers debarred from common 
and concerted action, everybody fights on his own hook and as best he can, 
and no talking and preaching can prevent a general sauve qui peut.a That the 
police have placed themselves at the di sposal of the Committee after the 
strike of the courts of law, shows that confidence in the stability of swindle is 
broken, and that it is considered safe to keep well with the ‘financial purity’ 
side. 
To my mind c’est le commencement de la fin.b The bourgeois republic and 
its politicians can hardly  outlive this unparalleled exposure. There are but 
three possibilities: an attempt at monarchy, another Boulanger, 6 or socialism. 
The first and the second, if attempted, could only lead to the third, and thus 
we may be called upon, long before we  in consequence of our own action 
had a right to expect it, to enter upon a career of immense responsibility. I 
should be glad of it, if it does not co me too soon and too suddenly. It will do 
our Germans good to see that the French have not lost their historical

were for Germany without leaving a sm all impression of the philistine even 
on the working class. Our revolution of 48/49 was too short and too 
incomplete to wipe that out altogether. Of course, the next revolution which 
is preparing in Germany with a consistency and steadiness unequalled 
anywhere else, would come of itself in time, say 1898-1904; but 
revolutionary times, preparing a thoroughgoing crisis, in France, would 
hasten that process, and moreover, if the thing breaks out in France first, say 
1894, then Germany follows suit at once and then the Franco-German 
Proletarian Alliance forces the hands of England and smashes up in one blow 
both the triple and the Franco-Russian  conspiracies; then we have a revo-
lutionary war against Russia—if not even a revolutionary echo from 
Russia— vogue la Galère!c

Dear Mrs Stepniak, 
Mrs Kautsky showed me your note in which you are kind enough to ask 
me to spend next Saturday evening with you. I should do so with the greatest 
pleasure, but unfortunately my locomotive capabilities are still too limited to 
enable me to undertake such distant expeditions. 
I am at present practically confined to the neighbourhood of Primrose

decline invitations besides yours.

Esteemed Comrade, 
Many thanks for kindly sending your Geschichte des Arbeiter-
Bildungsvereins.a I regard the publication of studies on the history of the 
Austrian labour movement as a highly rewarding task, the more so since in 
our fast-moving time some moments, important in themselves, are lost to 
posterity as they only live on in the memory of the participants and have 
never been recorded in writing. I, for my part, am again working diligently 
on Volume 3,b a bit of news which will probably compensate you for my not 
answering your kind letter in person. 
Yours faithfullyc

devilish misprint had accused you of bigamy too, something you ha d completely overlooked

ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV 96 
IN PARIS 
London, 14 December 1892 
My dear Lavrov, 
I do not see why I would oppose the publication of the letter from Lopatin 
about a conversation that he had with me. 97 Therefore do as you like. 
I was pleased to learn from Mendelson that you are well. As for me, I 
have no reason to complain—quite the contrary. For three months now I 
have been working on the 3rd volume of Capital, and although there is still a 
great deal to do, this time I have grounds to hope that I will finish it. 
As for the Berlin resolution, I am of the opinion that the Germans 
committed at Brussels the mistake of promising—although indirectly— more 
than they can fulfil. 54 The 1st May 1890 and ‘91 has shown that in Germany 
a strike is impractical; the sacrifices were not worth the possible gains. At 
Hamburg alone the attempt cost more than 100,000 marks. 98 The 
coincidence that 1st May 1892 was a Sunday led them to forget in Brussels 
that real world to which the crisis—more acute this time in Germany than 
elsewhere—has sharply returned them. 
The strike on 1st May ‘93 could cost us too dear—in Germany, and, by 
reaction, elsewhere. A strike in Germany would dry up both funds and

financial credit of the party for more than a year. And that at a time of 
military crisis and the possible dissolution of the Reichstag, 76 with elections 
in May or June. 
It is the law of the development of parties that a party which has achieved 
a certain degree of power finds that the very demonstrations which it could 
not do without in its early days have become impractical. 
For the rest, as for the forms, one could have shown a little more regard 
for the susceptibilities of others. However, what will you—these are the 
grobe Deutscht who do not know how to sugar the pill. 
As regards the rest, it seems to me that Panama 60 is more important than 
1st May, given the times. Panama puts me in mind of 1847, when every day 
one could expect some new scandal. 61 1847 dug the grave of the July 
Monarchy, and what  will 1892 bring? 
Yours,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 20 December 1892 
My dear Löhr, 
Yesterday we forwarded by Van Oppe n and Co’s Express (they have an 
office in Paris too, but I did unfortunately not note the address) the box with 
pudding and cake, and hope it will arrive  safe (directed to you, Le

Perreux). The pudding is not quite boiled out, our copper would not heat last 
Saturday and so, instead of twelve  hours’ boiling, the unfortunate pudding 
only got about nine or ten, But if you give it two to three hours’ boiling 
before serving, it will be all right. 
Before crossing the Channel, the Oxford sagea gave us a call here. I hope I 
quietened his anxiety about the first of Mayb to some extent, The attempt, in 
1890, to chômerc at Hamburg alone cost the party above 100,000 marks 98, 
and in my opinion it would never do to allow the bourgeois to bleed the 
German party’s cash and credit ‘ à blanc just at the moment when a 
dissolution of the Reichstag 76 is in the air, and when every farthing would be 
wanted. 
Panama is delightful, 60 The papers you so kindly send me, and old Mother 
Crawford’s letters—though awfully cut down by the respectable people of 
the Daily News —form already a pretty comprehensive dossier which I intend 
to complete up to the—I hope— bitter end. Respectability here, of course, 
triumphs. 
Wenn sich das französische Laster erbricht, setzt sich die englische Tugend 
zu Tischd—and I’ll be damned if I do not prefer a thousand times that plain 
open outright French vice to this hypocritical British virtue. Here corruption 
has been brought into a system and has been endowed with a complete code 
of étiquette which you have only to keep within, in order to be perfectly 
bullet-proof against all charges of undue corruption. In France no man would 
stand a chance in a popular constituen cy, a town especially, who openly 
wanted to get into Parliament for the purpose of furthering his own interests; 
here, anybody who wanted to get in for any other purpose would be 
considered a fool and a Don Quixote. The English Panama is called Building 
Society and has more than one head— the savings of the small people have 
been eaten up in these societies by wholesale, and no great fuss about it.e One 
M.P. is in here too, Spencer Balfour —he will take the Chiltern Hundreds and 
retire into private life—while lots of M.P.’s make money by selling their 
names as directors of all sorts of swindling companies, which is considered 
perfectly fair so long as it is not pushed to excess.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 22 December 1892 
Dear August, 
We recently had the pleasure of seeing Cato Censorius Bonnier here while 
in transit from Oxford to Paris. I think I made some impression on him by 
pointing out that 1. his manner of giving ultimatumsa is hardly calculated to 
promote mutual understanding and 2. that it really might be better if the 
German party were to preserve its funds  and its credit for th e eventuality of a 
dissolution and future elections rather than dissipate both on a stoppage of 
work on May Day. It’s unfortunate for both French and Germans that this 
chap should be an indispensable middleman between the two, since Guesde 
seems reluctant to make use of any one  else. But thwarted as it is by the 
isolation and inactivity of Oxford, his enthusiasm plus his intense urge to be 
up and doing serves to evoke discord rather than collaboration. And in the 
present state of Europe what is called for above all else is precisely the 
harmonious collaboration of Germans and French. 
Many thanks for the Reichstag stenographic reports. I shall not be able to 
read your big speech about the Army until tonight, but I was delighted by 
what you said about Heinze’s law. 99 So long as prostitution cannot be wholly 
eradicated, our first bid ought, I think, to be the girls’ total exemption from 
any kind of extraordinary legislation. Here in England this is more or less the 
case; there are no ‘morality police’, and no controls or medical examinations, 
but the police still have tremendous power  because it is a punishable offence 
to keep a disorderly house, and every house in which a girl lives and 
receives visitors can be treated as su ch. But although this law is enforced 
only on rare occasions, the girls ar e none the less exposed to frightful 
extortion on the part of policemen. This relative freedom from degrading 
police restrictions enables the girls to preserve an independent and self-
respecting character in a way that

would hardly be possible on the Continent. They look upon their situation as 
an unavoidable evil to which, since it has befallen them, they must resign 
themselves, but which otherwise need in no way affect their character or self-
esteem and, given the chance to get out of their profession, they seize upon it, 
as a rule, successfully. In Manchester there were whole colonies of young 
men—bourgeois or clerks—who lived with girls of this kind, being in many 
cases legally married to them and treating them at least as well as a bourgeois 
would a woman of his own class. The fact that now and then one of these 
girls might take to the bottle in no wa y distinguished them from their middle-
class counterparts over here, themselves no strangers to the habit. Indeed, 
some of these married girls, having moved to another town where there was 
no fear of their running into ‘old acquaintances’, have been introduced into 
respectable middle-class society and ev en into the squirarchy—squires being 
the English equivalent of country  Junkers—without anyone’s noticing 
anything in the least objectionable about them. 
It is my belief that, in dealing with this matter, we should above all 
consider the interests of the girls themse lves as victims of the present social 
order, and protect them as far as possible against ending up in the gutter—or 
at least not actually force them into the gutter by means of legislation and 
police skulduggery as happens throughout the Continent. In this country the 
same thing was attempted in a number of garrison towns where controls and 
medical examinations were introduced, but it didn’t last long; the only good 
thing the social purity people have done has been to agitate against this. 
Medical examinations are absolutely  worthless. Wherever they were 
introduced here, syphilis and gonorrhoea increased. I am convinced that a 
police surgeon’s instruments are exceed ingly effective in transmitting vene-
real disease, since he would be unlikely to spend time or trouble on disin-
fecting them. Free courses on venereal disease should be made available to 
the girls, then most of them woul d probably take precautions themselves. 
Blaschko has sent us an article on medical controlsa in which he is forced to 
admit that these are absolu tely useless; if he were to draw the logical 
conclusion from his own assumptions, he  would be bound to conclude that 
prostitution must be freed from all restrictions and the girls be protected

against exploitation, but in Germany that would seem utterly Utopian. 
I hope that Kneipp treatment is doing Dietz good; at all events Nasoa 
maintains that the crack-brained parson made him astoundingly healthy. By 
completely changing the habits of people the routine of whose urban 
professional lives has made them a bit rigid and set in their ways, and by 
forcing them to take exercise in the ope n air, the said cure may, from what I 
have heard, do them a certain amount of good or, indeed, harm—according to 
the nature of the case—just as does the ‘water cure’ when it is not as a rule 
the mineral water that does the trick, but rather the change of routine and the 
strict diet. But otherwise you are right; amongst our people there is many a 
one who deems it his duty fervently to embrace any and every new ‘ism’ and, 
likewise, any disgruntled bourgeois or bureaucratic malcontent, any obscure 
literary or artistic genius. He may equally well set himself up as the protector 
of all victims of persecution and injustice, and discover in every ism a theory 
of world redemption hitherto suppressed by the wicked capitalist world order. 
It is an excellent way of turning to  account and putting on display the very 
things one has not learnt. One has only to look at what the late-lamented 
Volksstaat achieved in that sphere! 
The Panama business 60 gets nicer every day. As  so often in France the 
affair is taking a quite dramatically exaggerated course. At any moment, or 
so it seems, the efforts to thrust it out  of sight are going to succeed, and then 
up it springs again where least expect ed and more vigorously than ever 
before. Now the situation is such that no hushing up will avail. First the 
affair was to be hushed up in the courts, whereupon fresh revelations 
necessitated the setting up of a committee of inquiry; then it was the latter 
that was to be hamstrung, an attempt that was only partially successful and 
only to the extent that further legal proceedings of a more serious nature 
were instituted. And now there’s a spate of fresh revelations and 
prosecutions of deputies and senators. The ball has been set rolling and is 
very far from coming to a stop. Standing in the wings are 1. Constans, who 
knows that he is played out and is anxious to avenge himself, 2. Rochefort 
and the Boulangists, 6 who also know a great deal, 3. the Orléans family, who 
would like to make use of all this farcical business to attempt a restoration. 
All these people know a great deal and can to a large extent prove it. And if 
the worst comes to the worst, Ch.

de Lesseps and Rouvier will avenge th emselves by compromising as many 
people as possible and involving them in their fall. Rothschild summed 
up the situation in the words: 
‘I need the monarchy and shall buy it once a nd for all; the Republic costs me too much, 
since every few years I have to buy yet another ravenous crew.’  
What wouldn’t that jackass Boulanger give for that now if he hadn’t shot 
himself! He’d be in clover; indeed, I shouldn’t be surprised if an attempt 
were made to find another Boulanger. Fortunately this would not be at all 
easy. The monarchy, too, is down on its luck—the Right voted as one man 
for the Panama lottery 100 and, what is worse, made propaganda for it in the 
rural areas, thus landing philistines a nd peasants in the cart. The 1,700 
million francs that were swallowed up consisted to a very large extent of the 
savings of little men (over 800,000 are said to be involved!), hence the wave 
of indignation, while the Right (Clerical Monarchists) who at first rejoiced 
over the Panama scandal, are now turning coy. 
How it will all end is obvious—ultimately in our favour. But in a country 
as incalculable as France it is difficult to predict what intermediate stages 
there will be. Several, at any rate, before our people really take possession of 
the stage. Only if there were to be revolution in Paris would the Socialists 
come to power; for in Paris—cf. the Commune— every revolution is 
automatically socialist. But Paris is less turbulent than the provinces and that 
is a good thing, Paris is blasé, not l east because the workers, disunited, 
confused and patriotic (in so far as they sense that Paris is—wrongly, or so 
they feel— no longer the political hub of the world), can see no way out. 
Should the scandals continue, there might be a presidential crisis—Carnot 
has at least connived at a lot of dirty work—and whatever happens there will 
be parliamentary elections next year. Also a good many municipal elections 
in Paris. All this will provide more than enough legal loopholes. On the other 
hand, uncertainty as to the reliability of the army (which is new to general 
military service and not so hardened to it as Prussia) is a safeguard against 
coups d’ état, as is the unarmed state of the masses (who this time could not, 
as always before, turn to the Na tional Guard for guns and ammunition) 
against attempted uprisings. It therefor e seems very probable that the crisis 
will take a peaceful course. It’s just what  we need, however, if we are to have 
time to reap the benefits of Panama—no violent upheavals and time for the 
ferment to take effect throughout the country. In the provinces the Marxists 
have virtually no rivals; in Paris it is, for the time being, quite

a good thing if Blanquists, 20 Allemanists 21 and Broussists 30 should wear 
each other out. 
At all events, internal developments in France have again become of 
paramount importance and we shall soon see to what extent the chaps are 
equal to the tasks by which they are c onfronted. I must say that, where major 
crises such as this one ar e concerned, I have consid erable confidence in them. 
Not in their ability to win instant and striking victories—there may yet be 
short-lived episodes of a horribly reactionary nature—but in their ability 
eventually to emerge with honour. Nor, from our point of view, should things 
happen too quickly. We too require time for growth. 
Quite between ourselves, I am over the worst so far as Volume II P is 
concerned. The difficulties in the most difficult section have been sur-
mounted. 33 But until I have been through th e last two sections I can say 
nothing definite about the da te of completion. There may still turn out to be 
individual difficulties that will take some time. But I have sighted land and 
the worse and most time-consuming part is behind me; this time I shall 
finish. When you come over here I shall show it to you. 
You would in any case do better to come via Calais; it’s hardly any further 
from Stuttgart and maybe even somewhat  nearer than via Ostend.—Cordial 
regards to you, your wifeb and your children and a Happy Christmas to you.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BERLIN 
London, 28 December 1892 
Dear Liebknecht, 
A Happy New Year to you, your wifea and your children. 
As regards the French, I pointed out to Lafargue more than a week ago 
that now’s the time.b However, it’s quite possible that the chaps don’t want 
to expend their powder too soon. To  begin with, the Panama affair 60 is still in 
its early stages, the more important revelations won’t come till after the New 
Year, and so far nothing serious has been proven, legally speaking, against 
any living parliamentarian; in January, both Radicals 86 and Monarchists may 
find themselves well and truly in the soup and then it will be possible to 
speak up far more effectually. Secondly, there are, in the Chamber, not only 
Marxists but also Blanquists, 20 Allemanists 21 and free lances à la Cluseret—
not to mention complete reprobates such as Lachize and Thivrier who have 
latched on to our coat-tails—and, with the socialist groups in Parliament 
differing as they do, it would be easy for the others to give them as good as 
they got, so to speak. Now an attempt is being made to find a common basis 
for action. If this succeeds, as seem s probable, it will be easier to get 
something done. 
I tender this merely as a possible e xplanation for the chaps’ silence. 
In this country we have long had to  contend with Bonnier’s enthusiasm. 
He fairly peppered us with shot over the May Day business. 54 I drew his 
attention to your statement in the Vorwärts in which you said that at 
Marseilles you had given the chaps advance notice of what the Germans’ 
attitude would be on 1 May ‘93, and that they had declared themselves 
satisfied.c 
So they have no right to complain. I then went on to tell him that, what 
with Panama in Paris, the military business in Berlin 76 and a general 
industrial crisis into the bargain, there might be something better for us

to do on 1 May than demonstrate. 3 Indeed, in Paris he would subsequently

Here, in old Europe, things are pr oceeding at a somewhat livelier pace 
than in your ‘youthful’ c ountry which still can’t quite  extricate itself from the 
hobbledehoy stage. It is remarkable, though perfectly natural, that in so 
young a country, which has never know n feudalism and has from the outset 
grown up upon a bourgeois basis, bourgeois prejudices should be so firmly 
entrenched even in the wo rking class. Indeed it is  precisely his opposition to 
a mother country still garbed in feuda lism that leads the American working 
man to suppose the traditional bourgeois ec onomic system he has inherited to 
be by its nature something immutably superior and progressive, a non plus 
ultra. Just as in New England, where pur itanism, precisely because it is the 
raison d’être of the whole colony, has become a traditional heirloom and all 
but indistinguishable from local patriotism. However much the Americans 
may twist and turn, they cannot simply di scount, as if it were a bill, what is 
beyond doubt a tremendous future, but will have to wait until it falls due; and 
precisely because that future is so great, their present must be largely taken 
up with preparations for it, a task which, as in any young country, is chiefly 
of a material nature and calls for a de gree of conservative thinking, a clinging 
to traditions connected with the f ounding of the new nationality. The Anglo-
Saxon race—those damned Schleswig-Ho lsteiners as Marx always called 
them—is in any case slow in the uptake, a trait its history both in Europe and 
in America (economic success and,  on the whole, peaceful political 
evolution) has tended to foster. Here momentous events alone can be of any 
avail and if, in addition to the transfer—now almost complete—of state-
owned lands into private hands, industry were to expand under a somewhat 
less hare-brained tariff policy and forei gn markets be conquered, things might 
also go well for you people. In this country, too, the class struggles were 
more violent during the period of growth of large-scale industry and petered 
out precisely at the time of Britain’s undisputed industrial domination in the 
world; similarly in Germany the growth of large-scale industry since 1850 
has coincided with the rise of the socialist movement, and in America things 
are not likely to turn out any differently. It is the revolutionising of all time-

by the growth of industry which likewise revolutionises men’s minds. 
Furthermore, the Americans have long provided the European world with 
proof of the fact that the bourgeois republic is the republic of capitalist 
businessmen in which politics is merely a business transaction like any 
other—something which the ruling bourge ois politicians in France have long 
known and practiced on the quiet, and whose truth is at last being brought 
home to the French on a national scale by the Panama scandal. 60 Not that the 
constitutional monarchies can preen them selves on their virtue, for each has 
its own little Panama; England, the building society scandals of which one, ‘the 
Liberator’, has conscientiously ‘liberated ’ vast numbers of small depositors of 
savings amounting to some £8 million 104 ; Germany, the Baare scandals and 
Lowe’s “Jewish rifles’ 105 (which prove that the Prussian officer is, now as 
always, a thief, but in a very, very small way—the one thing that is modest 
about him); Italy, the Banca Romana, already an approximation of Panama, 
which has bought some 150 deputies and senators 106 and concerning which, 
so I am told, documents are shortly to be published in Switzerland; Schlüter 
should keep an eye out for anything about the Banca Romana that appears in 
the press. And in Holy Russia the Russian Prince Mesh chersky waxes in-
dignant over the indifference with whic h the Panama revelations are received 
in Russia, the only explanation for this being, he says, that Russian virtue has 
been corrupted by the example of the Fr ench, and that ‘we ourselves have more 
than one Panama here at home’. 
However, the Panama affair is the beginning of the end of the bourgeois 
republic and may soon place us in so me very responsible positions. The 
whole of the opportunist 87 and the better part of the Radical gang 86 are 
compromised up to the hilt; the government  is seeking to hush things up but 
that is no longer possible, for documentary evidence is in the hands of people 
who wish to overturn those now in power: 1. The Orleans, 2. the former 
minister Constans, now out of the r unning because of reve lations about his 
scandalous past, 3. Rochefort and the Boulangists, 6 4. Cornelius Herz who, 
being himself deeply involved in all manner of frauds, has plainly taken 
refuge in London merely in order to buy his way out by compromising his 
fellows. All these people have more than enough evidence against this 
thieving crew, but are holding back, firstly and more generally, so as not to 
expend all their powder at one go and,  secondly, in order to give the 
government and the courts of law time to become hopelessly compromised. 
This is all grist to our mill; enough in formation gradually leaks out not only 
to keep the pot on the boil and

run the dirigeantsa increasingly onto the rocks, but  also to allow time for the 
scandal and the revelations to do their work in the remotest parts of the 
country before the inevitable dissolution of the Chamber and the general 
elections which, however, ought not to come too soon.  
That things have very nearly got to the point at which our chaps in France 
will be the only possible rulers of the state is evident. But it mustn’t happen 
too quickly, our people in France being by no means ripe for leadership. As 
things are now, it is absolutely impossible to say what intermediate stages 
there will be in the mean time. The old Republican parties are compromised 
down to the last man, while the Royalists and Clericals, having sold Panama 
lottery tickets 100 on a vast scale, have identified themselves with that affair—
if that idiot Boulanger hadn’t shot himself, he would now be cock of the 
walk. I should be curious to know whether the old unconscious logic of 
French history will again assert itself on this occasion. There are going to be 
a great many surprises. If only during the interval in which the air is being 
cleared, some general or other doesn’t seize power and foment a war; that is 
the only danger. 
In Germany the party’s undeviating, irresistible advance proceeds at a 
steady pace. Everywhere small successe s provide proof of progress. If the 
Army Bill 76 is adopted more or less as it stands, there’ll be a new floodtide 
of malcontents coming to join our ranks. If the bill is thrown out, there’ll be a 
dissolution, a general election, and we shall get at least fifty seats in the 
Reichstag which, in a conflict, might often give us the deciding vote. At all 
events the struggle, while it may, perhaps, also break out in France, can only 
be fought to a finish in Germany. But it’s a good thing that Volume II Ib is 
now at last to be completed—not that I can say when that will be. Times are 
growing unsettled and the wind is rising.

ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI 
IN MILAN 
[London,] 7 January 1893 
Dear citizen Turati, 
I was very pleased to see the translation of the Manifesto in the Lotta di 
classe but I am so overloaded with work that I have not been able to compare 
it with the original. In a few days I will send you a copy of the most recent 
German edition (London), with the comp lete prefaces, for your pamphlet 
edition. 
As for my writing a preface, here is my position. Anothe r Italian friend, 
whom you no doubt know, is preparing a translation, and perhaps a lengthier 
work on this writing.a As he told me of his intention before the publication of 
the first issue of Lotta di classe I  feel I must consult him before giving you a 
definitive answer. 108 Moreover, I am beginning to find these prefaces an 
embarrassment. Only recently I had to write one for a Polish translation. I 
really have nothing new left to say.

means that I should decide upon the sum without any prior agreement or 
knowledge of the actual circumstances. What we should offer depends on 
altogether too many circumstances of which I am completely ignorant. The 
comité in Manchester will surely be sending, or have sent out, some sort of 
appeal indicating roughly the amount to be raised, and an initial list of the 
first subscriptions, etc., etc. After all, one has got to know all this if one is to 
have any idea how high or low one should, or alternately should not, go. 
Would you therefore be so good as to inquire from Perkin what has been 
done in this respect and, if you think fit, ask him to inform me of it so that 
we have some kind of yardstick to go by. 
It’s a disgrace that these university ch aps should be such jackasses! I even 
had to put pressure on Roscoe to get him to write the article for Nature.a And 
the Germans—how proud they could be of Schorlemmer! But he didn’t 
belong to the you-scratch-my-back-I-scratch-yours clique and that’s why, 
now he’s dead, he has to suffer for the fact that he was no Panamite of 
academic learning. Panama left, ri ght and centre, nothing but Panama, 60 
even in academic chemistry!

Dear Mme Mendelson, 
The article in Vorwärts of which you speak was written in Paris.a It seems 
that the author was told that the 5 arrested Poles belonged to the same socialist 
school as, among the Russians, Plekhanov and his friends; and the correspon-
dent has thus committed the quid pro quo that we have all sadly read. 
The article which I sent to Vorwärts is in the following issue (No. II , 13th 
January). 111 
Let us congratulate ourselves nonetheless that this latest base action by the 
French government has only led to an expulsion.

find them I shall send them on to you. The reason for my failure to put them 
in the post was the Bakunin article which in the end I felt bound to answer, 
and that meant keeping the numbers here in case of possible controversy. In 
the last (13th)a article, which has unfortunately been mislaid—we have just 
realised that it has meanwhile been sent to you by Mrs Kautskyb—there is 
yet another batch of rubbishy anarchist lies. The author, who gives his 
name—one Héritier (a young Genevese, nurtured in the bosom of old J. Ph. 
Becker) tries to justify himself even  after my answer—mendaciously. Since 
he has written to me, I shall reply,c notifying him that, if be does the same 
sort of thing in his proposed opus, I sh all rap him severely over the knuckles 
for it. 49 
Over here the Independent Labour Party, 114 about which you will have 
read in the Workman’s Times, has held a conference in Bradford. Owing to 
their sectarian attitude the Social Democratic Federation, 44 on the one hand, 
and the Fabians, 43 on the other, have been unable to absorb the socialist 
accretions in the provinces, so that th e setting up of a third party was no bad 
thing. But now, such is the extent of those accretions—especially in the 
industrial districts of the North—that even at this, the first congress, the new 
party was more strongly represented than either the Social Democratic 
Federation or the Fabians, if not more strongly than both put together. And 
since the bulk of its members are undoubtedly first class, since its centre of 
gravity lies in the provinces rather than in that hive of intrigue, London, and 
its programme is substantially the same as our own, Aveling did right in 
joining it and in accepting a position on the Executive. If th e petty private 
ambitions and intrigues of the London panjandrums can be kept under some 
control, and its tactics are not too misguided, the Independent Labour Party 
may succeed in enticing away the masses, not only from the Social 
Democratic Federation but, in the provinces, also from the Fabians, and thus 
enforcing unity. 
The Social Democratic Federation has pushed Hyndman completely into 
the background. It did so badly as a result of his policy of intrigue that—
thanks to the provincial delegates—Hyndman has been utterly discredited in 
the eyes of his own people. An attempt to regain his popularity on the 
Unemployed Committee—on which other people sat too—by means of 
revolutionary ranting (his personal cowardice being 
a 12th in the Ms. — b Engels inserted this af terwards, in the margin. — c See this volume, pp. 85-

=====第109页=====
Letters- 1893 83 
a byword among his best friends), merely resulted in an increase of the 
influence wielded by Tussy and Aveling on that Committee. The only thing 
the Social Democratic Federation insists upon is its seniority as the oldest 
socialist organisation over here but in  other respects it has grown far more 
tolerant of others, has ceased to inve igh against them and is on the whole 
appreciably more aware of being what it is, namely far smaller than it made 
itself out to be. 
Here in London the Fabians are a bunch of careerists who have sense 
enough to recognise the inevitability of a social upheaval but are quite in-
capable of entrusting this gigantic task solely to the untutored proletariat and 
are therefore accustomed to take the lead; fear of revolution is their guiding 
principle. They are the ‘heddicated’ par excellence. Their socialism is 
municipal socialism; it is the commune not the nation, which, at any rate to 
start off with, is to be the owner of the means of production. They then 
proceed to propound this, their socialis m, as the extreme but inevitable 
consequence of bourgeois liberalism—hence their tactics of not directly 
confronting the Liberals as opponents but of inducing them to draw socialist 
conclusions, ergo they cheat them in order to PERMEATE LIBERALISM WITH 
SOCIALISM and do not put up socialist candidates against the Liberals, but 
rather foist the former on them by force if not by false pretences. That in so 
doing they are either betraying and hoodwinking themselves, or else are 
hoodwinking socialism, they do not, of course, realise. 
With great assiduity they have produced, along with all manner of trash, a 
number of good propaganda pieces —the best of this kind, in fact, the English 
have produced. But the moment they come to their own brand of tactics and 
gloss over the class struggle, the rot sets in. Hence, too, their fanatical hatred 
of Marx and all the rest of us —because of the class struggle. 
Needless to say, the chaps have a bi g middle-class following and therefore 
funds and, in the provinces, they have many dependable working men who 
refuse to have anything to do with the Social Democratic Federation. But 5/6 
of their provincial members see more or less eye to eye with us and, when it 
comes to the point, they will definitely desert. In Bradford—where they are 
represented—they have several tim es voiced unqualified opposition to the 
Fabians’ London Executive. 
As you see, it is a critical juncture so far as the movement over here is 
concerned, and something may come of the new organisation. For a short 
while it looked as though it might come under the wing of 
=====第110页=====

Champion who, whether consciously or unconsciously, is working for the 
Tories just as are the Fabians for the Liberals—under the wing of Champion, 
then, and of his ally Maltman Barry, whom you will remember from The 
Hague 115 (Barry is now by his own admission an agent in the regular pay of 
the Tories and MANAGER OF THE SOCIALISTIC WING OF THE CONSERVATIVES !) 
116—see Workman’s Times of November and December—but in the end 
Champion thought it best to resume his editorship of the Labour Elector and 
has thus taken up the cudgels against the Workman’s Times and the new 
party. 
It was a shrewd stroke on Keir Hardie ’s part to place himself at the head 
of this new party and yet another blunde r on the part of John Burns to remain 
aloof on this occasion as well, having already done himself a great deal of 
harm by his total inertia outside of his own constituency. I am afraid be may 
land himself in an impossible situation. 
It goes without saying that, in this  instance too, personal ambition is 
causing men like Keir Hardie, Shaw Maxwell and others to pursue sundry 
ulterior aims. But the danger inherent in this diminishes in proportion as the 
party itself grows in strength and numbe rs, and has, indeed, already receded 
because of the necessity of not leavi ng any loopholes for competing sects. In 
recent years socialism has made enor mous headway among the masses in the 
industrial districts, and I look to those masses to keep the leaders properly in 
order. Of course there will be blunders and to spare, and also jiggery-pokery 
of every description; let us only hope we are able to keep them within proper 
bounds! 
At worst the setting up of a new organisation may be regarded as an 
advantage in that it is easier to  achieve unity when there are three competing 
sects than when there are two which are diametrically opposed to one 
another. 
As regards what you wr ote about Poland on 23 December, since the time 
of Kronstadt the Prussians have been prepared to go to war with Russia and 
are therefore pro -Polish (indeed have provided proof of this). 117 The said 
Poles will have sought to exploit this to provoke a war whereby they hope to 
be liberated with Germany’s help. But that is not at all what Berlin wants 
and, should they pull off their coup, Caprivi will undoubtedly  leave them in 
the lurch. At the moment a war would be utterly useless to us; we have a sure 
means of making progress which a war could only disrupt.

ENGELS TO LOUIS HÉRITIER 
IN GENEVA 
[Draft] 
[London,] 20 January 1893 
Dear citizen, 
It is with sincere satisfaction that  I see from your letter of 25 December 
that the passage taken from your article on Beckera was distorted in trans-
lation. 49 Indeed, I was amazed when I saw your name at the end of the 
article. I had heard you spoken of with truly paternal affection, and the 
expressions used in your article on Becker constituted a far too painful 
contrast. Unfortunately, you still let the public believe them to be yours, as 
the rest of the article also. 
As for what you have to say in the Volks-Tribüne concerning my obser-
vations, this in no way changes my opinion. You must know that MM. the 
anarchists invented the slander about the conference held in Marx’s house 118 
with the sole purpose of proving that Marx wished to secure his own 
preponderance by any means, fair or foul. You say that this is his domination 
over the delegates. For you this alleged fact is worth being 
a Johann Philipp Becker  
=====第112页=====
86 Letters- 1893 
told. However, when I prove that it is false, you say that is a mere detail of 
no importance whatsoever. 
I have proved the falsehood of your assertion. You said that the London 
conference placed the Jurassians under the command of the Geneva Federal 
Council. I find that to be the opposite of the truth. You reply: ‘What I said 
seems to me today to be the absolute truth. ‘You remind me of good man-
ners, though I do not know in what respect: do you wish me to remind you of 
sincerity? 
Your No. XII a proves once again that you know almost nothing about 
what happened outside the anarchist milieu. Judging by your observations 
concerning the Geneva internationals, it would seem to me impossible that 
you have seen a complete collection of the Egalité de Genève. If the Geneva 
internationals were to some extent infected by petty-bourgeois ideas, they 
shared this defect with th eir adversaries, the anarchists, whom you prefer, yet 
who offer only the reverse of the petty-bourgeois coin, and with almost all 
the French and Belgian internationals—Proudhonists with few exceptions. Of 
all the groups of the Romance languages, only those among the Spanish 
supporters of the General Council were Social-Democrats in the present 
sense of that term. As for the rest, ha ve those of Geneva proved today that 
they are worth more than their predecessors? 
In the same No. XII ,a you reproduce a large number of anarchist errors 
and lies, and you accord them a faith wh ich, after my warning, should have 
lost some of its original naivety. You promise a second work on this same 
topic. I hope that, befo re engaging upon the matter,  you will obtain some 
documents which shed light on the assertions and machinations of the 
anarchists, and which will certainly enable you to judge impartially. 
Otherwise you will oblige me to reply again. It is of little importance what 
the bourgeois newspapers have to say a bout the old International, but when 
its history is distorted even in party organs this is quite a different matter. All 
that I ask of you is that you should not write about a subject without having 
studied both sides, the documents on this side and on that. Our worker public 
has to snatch from its meals and its sleep the few hours that it can devote to 
reading: it therefore has the right to ask that everything we present should be 
the result of conscientious work, and not lead to futile controversies that it is 
impossible to follow.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 119 
IN BERLIN  
London, 24 January 1893  
Dear August, 
I continue. Aveling’s verbal accounts have reinforced a suspicion pre-
viously entertained by me, namely that Keir Hardie nurtures the secret wish 
to lead the new party 114 in the same dictatorial fashion as Parnell led the 
Irish, and that his sympathies inclin e more towards the Conservative than 
towards the Liberal opposition party. He has said openly that, come the next 
elections, there should be a repetition of  Parnell’s experiment whereby he 
forced Gladstone to toe the line and that where no Labour candidate can be 
put up, people should vote Conservative by way of giving the Liberals a taste 
of their power. 120 Now this is a policy which, in certain circumstances, I 
myself have demanded of the English, but to proclaim something of this sort 
in advance, not as a possible tactical measure, but as tactics to be pursued no 
matter what the circumstances smacks strongly of Champion. Especially 
when, at the same time, Keir Hardie refers disparagingly to the extension of 
the suffrage and other reforms, which alone  might be expected to give reality 
to working-class suffrage  over here, as purely political matters which must 
take second place after social demands—e ight hours, industrial safety, etc. 
Though, renouncing as he does their enforcementhy Labour M.P.s, he fails to 
explain how these social demands are to be implemented unless by grace of 
the middle classes, or else by means of indirect pressure exerted by Labour’s 
casting vote in the elections. I draw your attention to this knotty point in 
order that you may be informed shoul d occasion arise. For the time being I 
do not attach any particular importan ce to the matter since at the very 
=====第114页=====
88 Letters- 1893 
worst Keir Hardie is likely to err gravely in his estimate of the workers in the 
industrial districts of the North of England, who are not a flock of sheep, and 
since he will, in any case, encount er opposition enough in the Executive. But 
a tendency of this kind ought not to be completely ignored. 
I look forward very much to seeing the stenographic report of Singer’s 
speech about the Stock Exchange; in the Vorwärts it read quite excellently.a 
But in dealing with this subject there is one point which all our chaps tend to 
overlook. The Stock Exchange is an  institution in which the bourgeois 
exploit, not the workers, but one another; the surplus value that changes 
hands on the Stock Exchange is already extant surplus value, the product of 
past exploitation of labour. Only when that process is complete can it serve 
the hanky-panky on the Stock Exchange. To begin with, the Stock Exchange 
is merely of indirect interest to us, in the same way as its influence and its 
repercussions on the capitalist exploitation of labour are merely indirect and 
exerted in a devious way. To suggest that the workers should take a direct 
interest in, and wax i ndignant over, the fleecing on the ‘Change of the 
Junkers, manufacturers and petty bourgeois is to suggest that the workers 
should resort to arms to protect the possession by their own immediate 
exploiters of the surplus value they have filched from those self-same 
workers. What an idea! But as the finest fruit of bourgeois society, as the 
breeding ground of extreme corruption, as the forcing house of the Panama 60 
and other scandals—and hence, too, as a first-class means for the 
concentration of capitals, for the disintegration and dissolution of the last 
remnants of natural cohesion in bourgeois society and, at the same time, for 
the destruction of all obligatory moral concepts and their inversion into their 
opposite—as an incomparable element of destruction, as the most powerful 
accelerator of impending revolution—in this historical sense the Stock 
Exchange is indeed of immediate interest to us. 
I see the Centre 71 has moved that there be a stay of prescription for the 
period in which the Reichstag suspends prosecutions. Since the Centre is the 
dominant party the motion seems likely to be carried. 121 Should this happen, 
it would seem to me inappropriate to make the government a gratuitous 
present of the above limitation of parliamentary rights without any quid pro 
quo. The quid pro quo should consist in the express acknowl- 
a Vorwärts, No. 17, 20 January 1893  
=====第115页=====
Letters- 1893 89 
edgement that the Reichstag’s right of suspension is also applicable to penal 
detention. Otherwise the Reichstag would again be beating a retreat—
whatever legal plausibility the measure might seem to possess. 
The bogey of war has again raised its head. Herewith Dalziel’s despatch 
from today’s Daily Chronicle —as a youthful competitor of Reuter, Wolff and 
Havas, Dalziel is more readily open to such reptilian manoeuvres. 122 The 
affair as such is absurd. The Russian s are simply not prepared for war and 
would have to be quite off their heads to embark on one now. There is, of 
course, a possibility that, after the failure of the last Parisian loan, 123 they 
would only be able to obtain money in Paris if war were really imminent or 
had already broken out—but that would be a counsel of despair. What cannot 
be completely ruled out is the possibility that the Opportunists 87 and Radicals 
86 in France will seek to save themselves from Panama by means of a war or 
at any rate have this at the back of their minds as a last recourse. But where 
could they find the pretext that would ju stify them in the eyes of the world? 
As I have said before, in the next war England will play a dominant role on 
account of its naval supremacy. 124 And as it happens, England has just played 
a nasty trick on the French in Egypt. 125 To gain England’s support, in the 
present state of tension between the two governments, there would have to be 
a casus belli which, even to your philistine, would seem a gross provocation, 
and this Caprivi will not provide. 
The more information I gather on this point, the more I am struck by the

order that he might, on the eve of the now inevitable war, give Austria to 
Russia in exchange for France: Leave me France and I’ll leave you Austria 
and Turkey and, what’s more, unleash Italy against Austria via Trieste and 
Trient.a And he clearly imagined he would pull it off. Reflect for a while on 
the course of history since 1878 127 and you will, I believe, come round to my 
view. 
To me Tutzauer’s hire-purchas e speech in the Reichstag Report

Would you be so kind as to send me another half-dozen copies of the 
circular in reply to the one issued by Free Russia? I would like to send it to 
my friends in Germany and elsewhere; perhaps you would be so good as to 
tell me if it has been sent to Bebel and Vorwärts.  
Is there a printing error on page 1, line 4? Is Dragomanov recommending 
the Polonisation of Lithuania, or its colonisation (by Russian colonists)?

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 26 January 1893 
Dear Baron, 
Gine has just told me that you are awaiting an answer from me about 
Marx’s biography. 130 It had in fact escaped my mind that this was urgent. 
Please accept my apologies. 
I wouldn’t know what to add to the material you mentioned—unless 
perhaps one or two bits from the sketcha in the Handwörterbuch der 
Staatswissenschaften that was sent to you. Elster—a cousin of Conrad 
Schmidt’s who referred him to me—asked me to write something for him, 
which I did, wholly from our own standpoint, all unsuspecting that be would 
print it—after he had deleted a few excessively unbourgeois passages. Well, 
it’s all one to me. 
The matter of the Neue Zeit has, of course, been shelved for the time being 
on account of Dietz’s treatment, apart from the fact of your having spoken to 
August.b He says it is impossible to revert to a monthly. In which case the 
external arrangements will doubtless remain pretty well unaltered—and it is 
up to the editors to make the paper more meaty and more amusing for its 
readers. At all events it seems to me that any drastic change will have to be 
put off until Dietz is fit for work again. And you yourself will in any case be 
swamped with a superfluity of good and well-

Tussy is tremendously busy agitating; she has been in the Midlands, 
Edinburgh and Aberdeen and is supposed to be coming here today. When I 
see her, I shall ask her for some personal reminiscences about Moor. 131 
I gave Ede the Brazilian paper, 132 though I told him that the importance of 
these South American parties is always in inverse proportion to the 
grandiosity of their programmes. 
Ede is gradually recovering from his neurasthenia; he has likewise re-
gained his old sprightliness, as is evident from his personal behaviour and 
also from his article on Wolf to whom he does too much honour.a I believe 
that what he now needs most of all is something to liven and cheer him up in 
order that his soundness of judgement may once more gain complete control 
over his still somewhat excessive aspirations after justice. 
Nothing fresh to report otherwise.—Also and, belatedly, a Happy New 
Year to you.

I have so arranged the articlec as to enable you to publish it either in three

subject to rigorous surveillance. Moreover I still don’t know whether the 
relevant documents are in a safe place ab road and so it is essential to avoid 
doing anything that might deliver them up into the hands of the Italian 
government. 
I have mentioned names only where the facts relating to them have already 
appeared in the Italian press and could therefore be produced as supporting 
evidence. The only exceptions are the two names Arbib and Martini on p. 3; I 
could provide no supporting evidence for these, so if you have misgivings 
delete them. 
The bearer of the revered name is Menotti Garibaldi, a lad who has 
already been hard at work for years past founding all sorts of things. 134 
Not long ago the Vorwärts alluded to Bonghi the Republicana—the man is 
an arch-reactionary and an ex-minister of the Right. All in all, the Vorwärts 
has been notable for such mistakes regarding foreign countries, not least 
England!

programme of the English Socialist League. 136 The Manifesto is a historic 
document, sui generis.a and if you attach to it a document dated forty years 
later, you will give the latter a special character. 108 Moreover, I cannot at the 
moment find the English original for co mparison, because I have not seen it 
since it first appeared, and I know nothing about the programmes and other 
publications of the Socialist League, a society which has rapidly become 
anarchist, so that all those members who did not want to take part in this 
change of front (the Avelings, Bax, etc.) have withdrawn. As a result the 
League that has been dead for some time is now only referred to here as an 
anarchist society. You can imagine,  therefore, to what quid pro quo a reprint 
of the original programme together with the 1848 Manifesto might lead.

Dear Madame Mendelson, 
A thousand thanks for the trouble you have taken to translate the two 
articles for me. 137 As for the warning —ostrzezenie —I had already deci-
phered it with the help of a Polish dictionary that I inherited from Marx. And 
the Gazeta Robotnicza has really been of unexpect ed assistance in my Polish 
studies—you say that the Polish in this newssheet is too German. Then it is 
like the Russian of Lavrov, and that explains why the Russian of the one and 
the Polish of the other present me with so few difficulties. I am indeed 
making progress, and if I had time to apply myself seriously to it for three 
months, I would venture to garble in Polish. 
I will try to make use of your manuscripts—in the meantime I would ask 
you to let me know if I may publish the facts contained in your letter on the 
Moscow students and Russian officers—without, of course, revealing the 
source of my information. 138

ENGELS TO VLADIMIR SHMUILOV 40 
IN DRESDEN 
[Copy] 
London, 7 February 1893  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. Dear Comrade, 
My best thanks for your kind hope that I should attain my nineties. If I 
remained as I am now, I should have no objection but were I, like so many, 
to degenerate physically and mentally as well, I would really rather not. 
Were that the case, I should prefer to be counted out. 
As to your requests regarding Marx’s biography, 140 I am afraid that there 
is little I can do to meet them. Moreover I lack the time, being engaged on 
the 3rd volume of Capital and unable to take time off from it. 
Ada I. There is nothing I can recommend over and above the biographical 
material already in your possession. Nothing reliable, at any rate. 
Ad II . Marx’s practical activities betw een 1844 and 1849 were in part 
devoted to the working men’s associati ons, especially the Brussels associa-
tion between 1846 and 1848, and to the League. 141 It is only on these last that 
you will find anything in print, namely in our prefaces to the Manifesto

Communist Trial along with my introductiona thereto, Zurich edition,

1885.—As regards the International, Eichhoff ALONE is reliable,b for he 
worked from Marx’s notes; all the rest from Fribourg,c to Laveleyed and 
Zacher,e are a source of nothing but LIES AND MYTHS . Here it would be more a 
case of writing a fat book to set matters right than of sending material for a 
third party to work on. I can, however, send you two publications issued by 
the General Council (Prétendues Scissions and L’Alliance de la Démocratie 
Socialiste)f for the decisive struggle with Bakunin.—Héritier’s offering in the 
Berliner Volks- Tribüne on the subject of the Jura Federation and M. 
Bakunin 49 betrays unexampled naïveté in its blind faith in the anarchists’ 
inventions and, from what Héritier writes and tells me, his translator has 
vitiated it still further in the anarchist sense. (In which case, by the way, the 
Russian censor will, with  his excisions, guard you against a good many 
mistakes.) 
Ad II I. You will have to get hold of The Holy Family by fair means or 
foul. In no circumstances will I let my own copy out of my hands and to 
supply particulars of the contents is an impossible task. Nor would it do any 
good to write out for you the main passa ges. You must be familiar with the 
whole. It surely ought to be possible to pick one up in Berlin. 
As to the genesis of historical materialism, you will, in my opinion, find 
everything you want in my Feuerbach (Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of 
Classical German Philosophy) —the appendix by Marx is, of course, itself the 
genesis! Also in the prefaces to the Manifesto (new Berlin edition, 1892) and 
to the Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial.  
Marx quietly elaborated the theory of surplus value in the fifties, all on his 
own, and resolutely refused to publish anything on the subject until he was in 
absolutely no doubt about each of  his conclusions. Hence the non-
appearance of the 2nd and subsequent instalments of A Contribution to the 
Critique of Political Economy. 142 
I am sending you the Splits and Alliance by post and hope these will 
suffice. Unfortunately that is all I can do for you.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 9 February 1893 
Dear August, 
First of all my congratulations on y our magnificent speech of 3 February 
which had already given us enormous pleasure in the Vorwärtsa excerpt but 
came out even better in the stenographic report. It is a masterpiece, in no way 
impaired by one or two minor theoreti cal inaccuracies, these being inevitable 
in verbal delivery. You are quite right to arrange for copies of the speech to 
be distributed in their hundreds of thousands,b notwithstanding and in 
addition to the distribution of the whole debate in pamphlet form.c 
This debate, in which the worthy bourgeois sought to dispel the tedium of 
sittings that had grown arid—thanks to their intrigues behind the scenes—
and also, whenever chance offered, to lead us nicely up the garden path, has 
turned out to be a truly colossal victory for us. And that they themselves 
sense this is borne out by the fact th at after Liebknecht ‘s speech they had 
had enough and indicated as much—through Stoecker! 143 So now at last the 
gentlemen have realised that if a parliament devotes it-

self for five days on end to social reorganisation in our own sense of the term 
and if, on top of that, the said parliament is the German Reichstag, this is a 
milestone symbolising yet another victory for the workers’ party. This latter 
circumstance has given proof to the whole world, friend and foe alike, of the 
triumphant position won by the German party. If things go on like this, we 
shall soon be able to exist at no cost of effort to ourselves, on the stupidity of 
our opponents alone. 
It was obvious that you would have to bear the brunt of the debate. So far 
as I can judge, Frohme’s speech did i ndeed provide some pretext for the 
victorious hullabaloo from Richter and Bachern and Hitze, and the business 
of Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle ought to be carefully investigated. If what 
Hitze asserted is correct, Frohme lacked the competence to quote from them, 
but if not, he ought to have made a personal statement in self-vindication. 144 
Otherwise everything went off beautifully and Liebknecht ‘s concluding 
speech, though indifferent in  content, was neverthe less ‘trenchant’ and good 
polemically. In short, it has been a triumph. The Witcha was so overjoyed 
that yesterday she called me Agnes Pinchpenny, whereupon I drew her 
attention to the fact that she was a proper Fidgety Ann, as anyone who knows 
her will confirm. She is even worse than the latter, for its not so much her 
legs that are fidgety but her brain. 145 
There is much to be said for your suggestions as to what the best plan for 
the Russians would be in case of war. 146 But don’t forget that if the 
overthrow of France would be intolerable to Russia, the suppression of 
Germany would be no less so to Italy and England. Every localised war is 
more or less subject to control by the neutrals. The next war, if it comes at 
all, will not permit of being localised in any way. They—the Continentals at 
any rate—would all be drawn in during the first months, it would au-
tomatically begin in the Balkans and England at most might be able to 
remain neutral for a time. Your Russian plan, however, presupposes a 
localised war and that, given the enorm ous armies of today and the appalling 
consequences for the vanquished, I no longer regard as possible. 
In Egypt it is simply a case of the Russians (the French are mere puppets 
on strings) making things difficult for the English, and thereby tying up their 
troops and fleet as much as possible. If war broke out, Russia would then 
have something to offer the English in return for an alliance 
a jocular name for Louise Kautsky  
=====第127页=====

or at least their neutrality and at such a juncture the French would be 
delighted to exchange Egypt for Als ace. Meanwhile the Russians are up to 
the same game in Central Asia on the Indian border where it will be years 
before they are strong enough to mount serious attacks and where the ground 
is very far from being prepared for this purpose. Incidentally, in connection 
with Egypt, Turkey should also fall to Russia. 
(Have just had another Russian visitor who has held me up for over an 
hour, the result being that it is now 4 o’clock and in consequence this will 
have to be a shorter letter.) 
I see that on your Military Committee you also have a Major Wachs. If he 
is the same man as a cousin of Dr Gumpert’s of Manchester, I met him there 
some 25 years ago, At that time he ha d joined the Prussians as a former 
lieutenant in the service of Hesse-Cassel and was much disappointed to find 
amongst his victors of 1866 the same preoccupation with spit and polish as 
had, or so he thought, been the cause of Hesse-Cassel’s defeat. 147 I gave him 
some encouragement, saying that if he would only go ahead and stick it out 
with the Prussians, he would probably discover that the army also had its 
good sides. Later on, at Spichern, 148 when in command of a company, he 
greatly distinguished hi mself by occupying on hi s own initiative a railway 
tunnel in defiance of his major. In the General Staff’s historya he is mentioned 
in most glowing terms—one of the very few lieutenants of whom it makes 
any mention at all. Since then I have read various strategic-political essays of 
his—most of them on the East—in which there are some very good things 
along with others (political) with which I don’t agree. At all events he is an 
efficient officer—if it’s the same man. 
By the way, a compromise seems more  probable than ever. Even the Free 
Thinkers 149 and the Centre 71 are prepared to supply 28,000 men, while 
Bennigsen is offering 40,000. No doubt so  many will fall by the wayside that 
the government will get 50,000 rather than  the 60,000 it wanted (perhaps also 
just a few more, provided it doesn’t waver) 76 and the bourgeois fatherland 
will once again be saved from dissolution and conflict. 
The ‘ball’ was thought up by our charming Witch’s fidgety brain. The 
‘Society’ 62 gave a concert which was followed by a ball. At 11 o’clock the 
first part of the concert ended, whereupon I obediently took my leave,

so the dancing cannot have started be fore 1 o’clock. She herself always 
speaks of dancing with a condescension more appropriate to someone many 
years her senior, and if she is to dance a waltz you yourself will doubtless 
have to lead her onto the floor. In which case I’m by no means so certain that 
her Viennese blood might not reassert its rights. 
In the next (February) No., now at the printers, the Polish Przedswit, 
which comes out here, will contain the following item: 150 At Grajewo, on the 
East Prussian border, there is a junior Russian official by the name of 
Spatzek, a Bohemian by birth, who is employed on translating way-bills. 
Despite his wretched wage he makes long journeys, some of them as far as 
Constantinople, leads a fast life, frequently enters Prussian territory on the 
pretext of hunting and is very friendly with Landrat von der Gröbben of Lyck 
who provides him with a vast quantity of hunting and other travel permits. 
When the frontier was closed on account of cholera, nobody was allowed 
across, but Mr Spatzek along with his wife and H-n, another Russian official 
suspected of spying, were able to travel to Königsberg without hindrance. In 
the opinion of people on the far side of the border this gadding about on 
German territory is purely and simply for the purpose of spying out the outer 
forts sited between the East Prussian lakes, on which occasions our overwise 
Prussian Landrat is only too pleased to be made use of by his Russo-
Bohemian friend. The arrogant Prussi an bureaucrats are everywhere easily 
taken in. 
Moreover the Russian troops on the border were not long ago the recip-
ients of a whole load of literature, to wit numerous copies of a pamphlet by 
Alexandrov, a lieutenant in the artillery in Tashkent, On the causes and 
necessity of the impending war.a One copy has been i ssued to each company 
in order that the officers ma y duly enlighten their men. 
Perhaps you might be able to make use of this information in your private 
conversations with the people on the Military Committee. 
Over here Keir Hardie has moved an amendment on the subject of 
unemployment 151 to the Address (Reply to  the Speech from the Throneb) in 
Parliament. In itself this was quite a good thing. But Keir Hardie committed 
two colossal blunders. 1. The amendmen t was formulated quite unnecessarily 
as a direct vote of censure on the government, so that its acceptance would 
have forced the government to resign and thus the whole thing was 
tantamount to a Tory manoeuvre, 2. he chose to be seconded by

the Tory Howard Vincent, a Protectionist, rather than by a Labour member, 
thereby completing the picture of a Tory manoeuvre and of himself as a Tory 
puppet. Moreover 102 Tories voted in his favour and only 2 Liberal-Radicals, 
152 not one Labour member. Burns was agitating in Yorkshire. As I have 
already written you,a his manoeuvrings and pronouncements since Bradford 
153 have more than once been suggestive of Champion’s influence; this has 
now become more than a suspicion. The source of his means of subsistence is 
unknown, and over the past two years he has spent a great deal of money on 
travelling. Where does it come from? The English working man demands of 
his parliamentary representatives and ot her leaders that they devote all their 
time to the movement. But if he won’t pay them, he himself is to blame if 
they accept money from other parties as a means of support and for electoral 
purposes. So long as this goes on, there will always be Panamites 154 amongst 
the labour leaders over here. 
Incidentally, if Mr Keir Hardie continues to be allowed to behave in this 
way, he will soon be laid low. The wo rking men of Lancashire and Yorkshire 
are not the sort of people to attach th emselves to conservative leading-strings 
or to pluck the Tories’ chestnuts out of the fire for them. Just give K. Hardie 
enough time and the consequences of his policy will rebound on him 
personally and become evident to all. 
Burns has gone to Halifax to agitate in connection with the elections and 
consequently did not vote on Keir Hardie’s motion. 
For it is by-election time in Huddersfield and Halifax, two manufacturing 
towns in Yorkshire, each of more th an 100,000 inhabitants.  The Independent 
Labour Party has put up a candidateb in Halifax, as have the other two 
parties. Then it made the following offer to the Liberals: If you withdraw 
your candidate in Halifaxc so that we only have the Toryd to contend with, 
we’ll vote for you in Huddersfield. The Liberals refused. Whereupon the 
LIBERAL WAS DEFEATED LAST TUESDAY IN HUDDERSFIELDe by the Toryf—as 
a result of the Independent Labour Party’s abstention, Again, at another by-
election in Burnley, Lancashire, not far from Halifax, the Liberals polled 750 
fewer votes than in the previous electi on—also as a result of our abstention. 
The poll in Halifax is being held today and the Tory will probably be elected. 
That would bring Gladstone’s majority, now 36, down to 34. Events such as 
these are

making things hotter each day for the Li berals. Up till now progress has been 
splendid and Gladstone will have to capitulate to the workers. Most 
important of all are the political measures, namely the extension of the 
franchise for working men by implementing what is presently on paper and 
which would increase the Labour vote by 50 per cent, the curtailment of the 
duration of Parliament (now seven years!) and the payment of electoral 
expenses and M.P.’s salaries out of public funds. 
Meanwhile these fresh successes scor ed by an independent policy are 
bound to increase the working man’s self-esteem and tell him that virtually 
everywhere the fate of the elections , and hence of each government, lies in 
his hands. That is the most important  part: self-confidence and self-reliance 
on the part of the class. It will also tide them over all the miserable little 
intrigues which are simply the result of the masses’ lack of confidence in 
themselves. Once we have a body of working men that really moves en 
masse, the crafty manoeuvrings of thos e worthies the leaders will cease, for 
they will do them more harm than good.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 12 February 1893 
My dear Löhr, 
Glad indeed I was to see your handwriting otherwise than outside an 
Intransigeant ox a Figaro, and I reply at once, as today Sunday I have a few 
minutes free and tomorrow I shall have to rush off again into the jungle of 
Banks, Credit, moneyed capital, rate of interest, in order to finish off Das 
Kapital, book II I, chapters 30-36. It is—this section V—as good as finished 
as far as real difficulties are concerned,  but it wants a good d eal of ‘finishing’ 
in the literary sense: arranging, weeding out repetitions etc. 33 This I hope to 
settle in 8-10 days, then come Sections VI and VII , and then—the end. My 
correspondence in the meantime is suspended and my rack is full, cram-full 
of unanswered letters from all quarter s, reaching from Rome to New York 
and from Petersburg to Texas; so if I snatch a moment to write to you, it’s 
only because it’s you and no one else. 
Louisea sent you a letter of seven pages rather more than a week ago—have 
you really never received that? Pleas e inquire, we will do the same here. 
Yes, the Arbeiterinnen-Zeitungyou will like. It has a healthy proletarian 
character in it—including the literary imperfections—which contrasts very 
agreeably with all the re st of the women’s papers. And you may well be 
proud of it, for you too are one of its Mamas! 
I am sorry to hear about Paul’s continued unsatisfactory health—has he 
not yet got rid ofthat infernal taenia? Surely there is plenty of Filix Mas or 
Koussoh to be had in Paris to drive it out, even without a regular siege. Of 
course as long as he nurses it, he will not get well, the beast will eat him up. 
And why in the name of goodness does he travel thus? Nobody out of France 
can make it out that he and others allow this splendid opportunity to slip out 
of their hands. 155 I can very well understand that the harum-scarum lot of so-
called Socialist deputies does not want him to speak, they all pull in different 
directions and play each his own game, and they know that Paul, once in the 
tribune, would be unacc ountable and incon-

trollable by them, but from our point of view that is the very reason why he 
should speak. Are the Socialists, ju st before the elections. 156 by their silence 
to create the suspicion that  they are no better than the Panamitards and have 
reasons of their own to screen them and to hush the whole thing up? In Italy 
that is the case, the couple of men elected in the Romagna (as Socialists) are 
in the hands of the government through the subventions paid by the latter to 
the so-called cooperative societies directed by the former, and which 
subventions as likely as not come out of the coffers of the Banca Romana. 
That accounts for their silence. 106 But in France!?! I can assure you, this 
unaccountable silence has not raised the respect in which the French 
Socialists are held abroad. Of course , Brousse and Co. have had their share 
out of the secret funds furnished by Panama—but is not that a reason more 
for our people to speak out? Formerly à la guerre comme à la guerre was a 
French proverb, is it still so? 
According to Mother Cr awford, the severe sentences on the Lesseps and 
Co. are mere dust thrown into the eyes of the gogosa—the Court of Cassation 
will quench them, 157 on the ground that the Prinet instruction did not 
interrupt prescription, and that therefore the délits en question sont prescrits.b 
If that turns out to be the case, then it means that the ‘knowing ones’, ceux 
qui ont touchéc are bold enough to tell all France that she is a gogo all over. 
That would be se moquer du mondé with a vengeance. 
Well, I hope the popular wrath will be roused at last, and vengeance taken. 
It’s getting time. 
Bebel shall send you his speech of the 3rd February in the Stenogramm. It 
is really splendid, and you may find it very useful for the Socialiste. 158 Our 
people have had the Reichstag all to themselves for a fortnight. First the 
Notstandsdebatte,e 3 days, and all parties, from the government downwards, 
imploring our men to use their power to smooth matters down with the 
striking colliers, etc. 159 Then the colossal blunder of the bourgeois to 
provoke our people to a debate on the future organisation of society—this 
lasted five days! 143 —the first time the subject as been discussed in any 
parliament. And only three speakers on our side at all—Bebel spoke twice, 
Frohme and Liebknecht—and the bourgeois had to leave us the last word 
and give it up in despair (for we could stop the clôturef by a simple count 
out, there never being the quorum of 201 present).

Dear August, 
You will have received the document I sent off by registered mail yes-

I had envisaged its being published in  8 articles in 8 successive numbers 
of the Vorwärts. But some other method may seem better to you, in which 
case feel free.

of anything better. 160 You couldn’t very well call it a Social-Democratic 
Military Bill, though this might do at a pinch if you were to adopt the 
proposal en bloc.  
I sent the thing to you rather than to Liebknecht because you are a member 
of the Military Committee and asked me for a ‘lecture’. That will exonerate 
me so far as he is concerned. Also because I would sooner entrust you than 
him with such alterations as may be demanded by the Press Laws, and, in 
general, because the article is the concern not merely of the Vorwärts, but of 
you all, and you might have your ow n individual opinions as to the best 
method and time of publication—at any rate before the matter is again 
debated in plenary session. 
As you will have seen from the Workman’s Times, the English working 
man is, thanks to the Avelings, now ke pt better informed about party affairs 
on the Continent, 158 especially those in Germany. 161 
After what happened in the last elections, the Liberal government has had 
to stir its stumps a bit. True, the meas ures are ‘Liberal’ but at any rate better 
than might have been expected. The new Bill re electoral registers, 162 if it 
should go through, will 1. strengthen the Labour vote by at least 20 to 30 per 
cent and give the workers an absolute majority in another 40 or 50 
constituencies, and 2. save the candidates a considerable outlay every year; 
the latter have themselves been responsible for getting their voters placed on 
the register, and that’s a very expensive business over here. This can pass 
muster.—Salaries for M.P.s are very much on the cards and should 
materialise, if not in this session, then almost certainly in the next one. 
Gladstone has accepted them in principle. Again, it’s a great advantage that 
there should be only one electoral register, i.e. only one suffrage, for all 
public elections, and the importance of this  is enhanced by the fact that there 
is another Bill in sight for the setting up of Parish (over here rural parishes) 
Councils 163 which will eliminate the last traces  of what has hitherto been a 
semi-feudal system in country districts. If all this goes through and becomes 
law during this session, the political position of the working class will be 
materially improved, which is in itself an added incentive for the chaps to 
make the most of that new position. However many intrigues and blunders 
there may be over here, and these will be legion, there can be no doubt that 
tremendous progress is being made, and in a few years’ time you may 
already find cause for surprise in the English.

that, I have to forbid myself all extra-work and even all correspondence that 
is not absolutely necessary. Otherwise nothing would have detained me from

upon a very difficult subject too, but as far as I recollect the Ms.a is far more 
finished than that of Section V. So that  I still hope to be able to complete my 
task in the allotted time. The great difficulty was, to get 3-5 months absolute 
freedom from all interruption, so as to devote the whole time to Section V, 
and that is now fortunately done. In working, I have often thought of the 
immense pleasure this volume will give to you when it appears. I shall send

Maintenant revenons à nos moutons.b 
We seem to be agreed upon all points except one, which you tackle in 
both your letters of 3d October and 27 January, though in each from a 
different point of view. 
In the first you ask: was the economic change, which after 1854 had 
become unavoidable, 166 of such a nature that it must, instead of developing 
the historical institutions of Russia, on the contrary attack them in their root? 
In other words, could not the rural commune be taken for the basis of the 
new economic development? 
And, January 27th, you express the same idea in this form: the grande 
industriec had become a necessity for Russia, but was it unavoidable that it 
was developed in a capitalistic form? 
Well, in, or about, 1854 Russia started with the commune on the one hand, 
and the necessity of the grande industrie on the other. Now, if you take the 
whole state of your count ry into account, as it was at that date, do you see 
any possibility of the grande industrie being grafted on the peasants’ 
commune in a form which would, on the one hand, make the development 
ofthat grande industrie possible, and on the other hand raise the primitive 
commune to the rank of a social institution superior to anything the world 
has yet seen? And that while the whole Occidentd was still living under the 
capitalist régime?. It strikes me that such an evolution, which would have 
surpassed anything known in history,  required other ec onomical, political 
and intellectual conditions than were present at that time in Russia. 
No doubt the commune and to a certain extent the artel, contained germs 
which under certain conditions might ha ve developed and saved Russia the 
necessity of passing through the torments of the capitalistic ré-

gime. I fully subscribe to our author’s letter about Zhukovsky.a But in his, as 
well as in my opinion, the first condition required to bring this about, was the 
impulse from without, the change of economic system in the Occident of 
Europe, the destruction of the capitalist system in the countries where it had 
originated. Our author said  in a certain preface to a certain old manifesto, in 
January 1882, replying to the question whether the Russian commune might 
not be the starting-point of a higher social developmentb: if the change of 
economic system in Russia coincides with a change of economic system in 
the West—so that the two complement  each other, the present Russian 
common ownership of land may serve as the starting-point for communist 
development.c 
If we in the West had been quicker in our own economic development, if 
we had been able to upset the capitalistic regime some ten or twenty years 
ago, there might have been time yet for Russia to cut short the tendency of 
her own evolution towards capitalism. Unfortunately we are too slow, and 
those economic consequences of the capitalistic system which must bring it 
up to the critical point, are only just now developing in the various countries 
about us: while England is fast losing her industrial monopoly, France and 
Germany are approaching the industrial level of England, and America bids 
fair to drive them all out of the world’s market both for industrial and for 
agricultural produce. The introduction of an, at least relative, free trade policy 
in America is sure to complete the ruin of England’s industrial monopoly, 
and to destroy, at the same time, the industrial export trade of Germany and 
France; then the crisis must come, tout ce qu’il y a de plus fin de siècle.d But 
in the meantime, with you, the commune fades away, and we can only hope 
that the change to a better system, with us, may come soon enough to save, at 
least in some of the remoter portions of  your country, institutions which may, 
under these circumstances, be called upon to fulfil a great future, But facts 
are facts, and we must not forget th at these chances are getting less and less 
every year. 
For the rest I grant you that th e circumstance of Russia being the last 
country seized upon by the grande capitalist grande industrie, and at the

same time the country with by far the largest peasant population, are such as 
must render the bouleversement 3 caused by this economic change, more 
acute than it has been anywhere else. The process of replacing some 500,000 
landowners,b and some 80 million peasants by a new class of bourgeois

leads her triumphal car over heaps of corpses, not only in war, but also in

thusiasm for the republic—with a small r; since it has been written with a 
capital R, it seems worthless, save as an almost obsolete historical stage. 
Your speech was very good and I regret  only one thing: that it was not 
delivered two months ago. 168 But better late than never.a It doesn’t surprise 
me that the Chamber and the press f ound it ill-timed; if we were to wait upon 
their  placetb we should never open our mouths. As for the Millerand & Co. 
Radical Socialists, it is absolutely esse ntial that the allian ce with them should 
be based on the fact that our Party is a separate Party, and that they recognise 
that. 169 Which in no way rules out joint action in the forthcoming elections, 
provided that the distribution of seats to be jointly contested is made in 
accordance with the actual st ate of the respective for ces; those gentlemen are 
in the habit of claiming the lion’s share. 
Do not let the fact that your speech es in the Chamber do not create as 
much stir as formerly discourage you. Look at our people in Germany: they 
were booed for years on end, and now the 36 dominate the Reichstag. Bebel 
writes saying: if we were eighty or a hundred (out of 400 members), the 
Reichstag would become an impossibility. There is not a debate, no matter 
what the subject, in which we do not intervene and we are listened to by all 
the parties. The debate on the socialist organisation of the future lasted five 
days, 143 and Bebel’s speechc was wanted in three and a half million copies. 
Now they are having the whole debate published in pamphlets’ 1 at five sous, 
and the effect, already tremendous, will be doubled! 
You are absolutely right to prepare for the elections. We ought to conquer 
at least 20 seats. You have the immense advantage of knowing, from the 
municipal elections, the minimum extent of your strength in each locality; for 
I am sure that, since last May, you have appreciably increased it. 170 That will 
help you greatly in distributing candidatures between yourselves and the 
Radical Socialists. But possibly you would prefer to put up your candidates 
wherever you stand a chance, with the proviso to withdraw them, if 
necessary, in favour of the Radicals, for the second ballot, in the event of the 
latter having polled more votes. 
The most important thing in the elections is to establish once and for

all that it is our Party which represents socialism in France, and that all the 
other more or less socia list fractions—Broussists, 30 Allemanists, 21 and pure 
or impure Blanquists 20—have been able to play a part beside us only by 
virtue of the dissensions incidental to the more or less infantile phase of the 
proletarian movement; but that now the stage of infantile disorders is over, 
and the French proletariat has reached  full consciousness of its historic 
position. Should we win 20 seats, all th e others combined will not have as 
many, since they are more likely to lose some than to gain any. In which case 
things will go forward. In the meantime, nurse your re-election: I have a 
feeling that your absences from the Chamber have not contributed any too 
much to ensure it. 
Panama 60 is not finished, not by a long ch alk. And it is a disgrace that the 
trouble and honour of making disclosures should be left to the Royalists and 
their dubious allies. They could not have a better battle cry than: Down with 
the robbers, and if the great mass of the stupid countryside takes their part 
against the Republicans, it is to the cowardice of the Radical Republicans 86 
that they will owe this tr iumph. You say that the republic is not in danger, 
that the deputies have returned from the recess with this certainty; well, then, 
they should strike for all they are worth and not let themselves be confused 
with the robbers by their silence. Y ou are quite right: th e political ineptitude 
of the whole bourgeoisie defies the imagination. 
The only country where the bourgeoisie still has a little common sense is 
England. Here the formation of  the Independent Labour Party 114(though still 
in embryo) and its conduct in the Lancashire and Yorkshire electionsa have 
put a match to the government’s backside; it is stirring itself, doing things 
unheard-of for a Liberal Government. The Registration Bill 162 unifies the 
suffrage for all parliamentary, municipal, etc., elections, 2) adds at least 20 to 
30 per cent to the working-class vote, 3) removes the cost of election 
expenses from the candidates’ shoul ders and places it on those of the 
government. The payment of an honorarium to M.P.s is promised for the next 
session; and there are also a whole number of juridical and economic 
measures for the benefit of workers. In short, the Liberals recognise that, to 
make sure of governing at the present time, they can do nothing but increase 
the political power of the working class who will naturally kick them out 
afterwards.

The Tories, on the other hand, are behaving at the moment with un-
bounded stupidity. But once Home Rule 171 is on the Statute Book, they will 
realise that there is nothing for it but to enter the lists to gain power, and to 
that end there remains but one means: to win the working-class vote by 
political or economic concessions; thus  Liberals and Conservatives cannot 
help extending the power of the working class, and hastening the time which 
will eliminate both the one and the other. 
Amongst the workers here, things are going well. They begin to realise 
their strength more and more, and that there is only one way of using it, 
namely, by forming an independent party. 
At the same time international feeling gains ground. In short, things are 
going well everywhere. 
In Germany the dissolution of the Reichstag is always a possibility 76 ; 
however, it lacks probability; everyone, apart from us, is afraid of it. We 
should win 50 to 60 seats.

separate note. 
And this is, about your silver wedding here on the 2nd of April. You know 
you have promised, and I keep you to your word. Now as it is as likely as 
not, or rather more likely, that Paul will have to go to the Brussels

thence? Unless you prefer going with him and having a look at your native

the honour you conferred on it.

for the happy event, and so, not being able, or rather having forgotten to add

Dear Citizen Turati, 
I am sending you the proofs, though I have not been able to examine them 
in depth in the little time you gave me. 178 I am staying at the sea coast for a 
few days, 175 and the packet was sent to me here, which was a further loss of 
time. 
You are free to add the programme of the International—that is, the 
Statutes and Preamble,a or the Inaugural Address of 1864,b as I do not have 
here a copy of the Russian edition of the Manifesto. I do not know exactly 
what it is you are talking of. 
Thank you for the two brochures, which I shall read with great interest. 
Mme Kulishov has probably received a letter from Mme Kautsky by now. 
Greetings to Mme Kulishov and to yourself from Mme Kautsky and yours 
truly,

ENGELS TO F. WIESEN 179 
IN BAIRD (TEXAS) 
London, 180 14 March 1893  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. Dear Comrade, 
An accumulation of work has preven ted me from replying any sooner to 
your note of 29 January. 
I don’t see why it should necessarily represent an infringement of the 
Social-Democratic principle if a man puts up candidates for some political 
office for which election is required and if he votes for those candidates, 
even if he is engaged in an attempt to abolish that office. 
One might consider that the best wa y to abolish the Presidency and the 
Senate in America would be to elect to those posts men who had pledged 
themselves to bring about their abolition;  it would then be logical for one to 
act accordingly. Others might consider this method to be inexpedient; it’s a 
debatable point. There could be circumstances in which such a mode of 
action might also involve a denial of the revolutionary principle; why it 
should always and invariably be so, I entirely fail to see. 
For the first objective of the labour m ovement is the conquest of political 
power for and by the working class. Once we are agreed on that, differences of 
opinion between upright men, in full command of their wits, as to the ways 
and means of struggle are unlikely to give rise to a dispute over principles. 
In my view the best tactics in any given country are those which lead most 
quickly and surely to the goal. But in America in particular that goal is still a 
very long way off, and I believe I woul d not be wrong in attributing to this 
very circumstance the importance which is still sometimes attached to such 
academic issues over there. 
I authorise you to publish these lines—unabridged. 
Very sincerely yours, 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 173 
AT LE PERREUX 
Eastbourne, 175 14th March 1893  
28 Marine Parade 
My dear Laura, 
Well, that was a pleasant letter of your s. So we expect you as early as 
possiblea in the course of next week, and once here, we shall not let you 
cross the Channel again under, at least, a fortnight or three weeks; even if 
the ‘honourable member’b could not be spared from his agitating tour for so 
long. 
We shall return on Fridayc to London. On Saturday Louise and I have both 
promised to speak at the joint Commune Celebration of the Verein 62 and 
Bloomsbury Society 181—a joint festival, though I’d rather have a good 
butcher’s joint. The Sunday following is the Brussels Conference 172—that is 
to say the second Sunday following, viz. the 26th; you do not say whether 
Paul will be there though it would be very important, on account of certain 
intrigues carried on by the old clique Hyndman-Brousse-Allemane, 
supported, for the time being, by Seidel, the secretary of the Zurich 
Committee 182 ; evidently a last attempt is going to be made by this bro-
kendown lot to prepare for themselves  a more favourable position at the 
Congress. From Brussels, Bebel 183 is almost certain to come to London for a 
few days and maybe Liebknecht too. 
Now I should be uncommonly glad to ha ve Paul and Bebel here together 
for a few days in order to do away once for all with certain  French prejudices 
against Bebel who is by far the best man we have in Germany, in spite of 
what the French may consider his Teutonic rudeness. So you see I have a 
special interest of a political character, besides the personal one, in your 
showing up here early in the week. 
I do not at all object to a tour de France made by Paul in an organised 
electoral campaign; on th e contrary I consider it a capital move. But a

deputy after all has certain duties in the Chamber, especially in this Panama 60 
time, and as every election depends, after all, on the votes of a goodly 
number of plus ou moins indifferent philistines, it struck me that his re-
election might be put in jeopardy by his neglect of his parliamentary 
functions. Indeed I have heard something to that effect hinted at. And when I 
saw his continued absence during some very important moments of the 
Panama crisis, I could not help thinking that he was losing some very 
important chances, and that all this could be brought up against him. Apres 
tout,b it would be too much generosity on his part to prepare seats for others 
and lose his own. If you were as strong in France as our people in Germany, 
where above twenty seats belong to us almost et par droit de conquête et par 
droit de naissance,c then it would be different, but then such violent 
campaigns would not be required either. 
To-day is Mohr’s dying day, and just the tenth anniversary. Well, in strict 
confidence I can tell you, that the 3rd volumed is as good as ready. The most 
difficult section, Banks and Credit, 33 is finished; only two more sections 
remain, of which only one (Rent of Land)e may offer some formal difficulties. 
But all that remains to be done is mere child’s play to what I had to do. Now 
I need no longer fear interruptions. What I had not been able to get before 
this last winter, was 4-5 months clear of such interruptions; now I’ve had 
them and the thing is as good as done. Only don’t tell anyone, as I cannot yet 
fix the time, within a couple of months, when the Manuscript can go to the 
printer’s. 
As to what you say of Jaurès, that fills me with terror. Normalien et ami, 
sinon protégé, de Malonf—which of the two is worse? And yet, neither of 
them is a qualification equal to the superiority of a man who can write in 
Latin on the origin of German Socialism.g 
Now then I must close. The sooner we hear from you in London about the 
day of your arrival and the earlier you fix that date, the better. Ainsi donc, au

yesterday evening with some anxiety. All’s well that ends well, and I cannot 
wait to see him again on Saturdayb evening—in any case, we hope to have 
the pleasure of seeing both of  you on Sunday at our place. 
We have been here for a fortnight, and we are returning to London the day

ENGELS TO HENRY DEMAREST LLOYD 184 
IN CHICAGO 
[Draft] 
Eastbourne, middle of March 1893 
Dear Sir, 
I have duly received your two favors of 3/2 and 9/3 with enclosures. I 
very much regret that I shall not be able either to assist personally at your 
Congresses 185 or to supply the papers you ask me for. I should send them to 
you with the greatest pleasure, were it not that all my time is at present taken 
up with the manuscript of the third book of my late friend Karl Marx’s great 
work on Capital, which I am preparing for publication. This third book ought 
to have been out years ago; but never until now could I secure that continued 
freedom from interruption which alone will enable me to finish my task. I 
have been compelled to decline all outside work, though ever so tempting, 
unless absolutely necessary. By the time your congress meets, the MS ought 
to go to press, but this could not be, were I to accede to your request. For the 
work you ask me to do ought not to be journalistic commonplace; it ought to 
be the very best I can furnish, it w ould require mature study and thought; and 
that means a considerable amount of time, which for the reasons given, I am 
not in a position to sacrifice. 
I have, however, forwarded you per bookpost a copy of the English edi-
tion of the Communist Manifesto of 1848 (by K. Marx and myself) and 
another of my Socialism: Utopian and Scientifica published a few months 
ago, as a small tribute which I hope may prove of interest to some members 
of your Labor Congress.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 186 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 18 March 1893 
Dear Sorge, 
We have just spent a fortnight by the sea at Eastbourne 175 where we had 
magnificent weather and whence we have  returned greatly refreshed. Now 
we can get down to work again. But in fact the visiting season is once more 
upon us—next Sunday (tomorrow week) there’s the Brussels Conference on 
the Zurich Congress, 172 when Bebel will nip over here for a few days 183 the 
Lafargues will be coming at the same time and I am glad to have again 
inveigled the young man over here so that he and I can discuss French affairs 
at some length. All the same I ought s till to have enough time left to finish 
off Volume II P since I am now over the worst. 
The matter of the Socialiste has now been settled. 
It would seem that a crash is the only solution to the silver business in 
America. 187 For Cleveland does not, it seems, have either the strength or the 
courage to smash this vicious circle of corruption. And it really would be a 
good thing if there were to be a crisis. A nation—a  young nation—so proud 
of its ‘practice’ and at the same time so frightfully bone-headed in the matter 
of theory as America can only eradicate so ingrained an idée fixe at the cost 
of damage to itself. The plausible idea that, if one has no money when one 
needs it, this is because there is not enough money in the world at large, is a 
childish notion common both to the PAPER CURRENCY nonsense à la Kellogg 
and to the silver nonsense, and the sure st cure for it is experimentation and 
bankruptcy which last might also prove quite beneficial to ourselves in other 
respects. Provided only some sort of tariff reform is achieved this autumn, 
there will be no need for you to repine, for the rest will surely follow. The 
main thing is that American industry is becoming capable of competing on 
the world market. 
Over here things are going very well. The masses are undoubtedly on the 
move, and of this you will find details in Aveling’s admittedly somewhat 
long-winded reports in the Volkszeitung. The best evidence of this 
a of Capital  
=====第151页=====

is the fact that the old sects are losing ground and having to fall into line, The 
Social Democratic Federation 44 has actually deposed Mr Hyndman; every so 
often he is allowed to do a little grum bling and grousing a bout international 
politics in Justice, but he is finished, HIS OWN PEOPLE HAVE FOUND HIM OUT . 
For the space of ten years the man lost no opportunity of provoking me 
personally and politically, a nd I never did him the honour  of replying, in the 
conviction that he himself was man enough to effect his own ruin; eventually 
I was proved right. After a whole decad e of carping they recently invited 
Tussy to write reports on the international movement for Justice, an 
invitation she naturally declined pending the public retraction of the infamous 
calumnies of herself and Aveling which Justice has for years been the 
vehicle. 
The same thing is happening where the Fabians 43 are concerned. As in the 
case of the Social Democratic Fede ration, their own branches in the 
provinces have outgrown them; in this, as in the Chartist movement, 
Lancashire and Yorkshire are again taking the lead. Men like Sidney Webb, 
Bernard Shaw, etc., who WANTED TO PERMEATE THE LIBERALS WITH 
SOCIALISM , must now submit to being permeated BY THE SPIRIT OF THE 
WORKINGMEN MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN SOCIETY . They fret and fume but IT’S 
NO USE —either they remain on their own, officers without soldiers, or they 
conform. The first seems more likel y and is also more desirable. 
The Independent Labour Party 114—as the latest arrival—has brought with 
it fewer ingrained prejudices, contains good elements, the working men of 
the North being the arbiters, and to that extent is the most genuine expression 
of the present movement, True, there are amongst the leaders all kinds of odd 
individuals and even many of the best, as in America where you are, have 
acquired the parliamentary system’s deplorable habit of cliquism, but they 
have the support of the masses who will e ither teach them how to behave or 
throw them overboard. They still make blunders and plenty of them, but the 
worst perils are over and I now look for rapid progress which will not be 
without its repercussions in America. 
In Germany the situation has almost r eached crisis point. According to the 
last reports on the sessions of the Military Committee a compromise would 
hardly seem possible. 76 The government is making it impossible for the 
gentlemen of the Centre 71 and the Free Thinkers 149 to change sides,a and a 
majority cannot be obtained without 40 or 50 of their number. So

there’ll be a dissolution and new elections. If all goes well, I reckon that we 
shall get 2 1/2 million votes, for our numbers have grown like mad. Bebel’s 
estimate is 50 or 60 seats, for the geography of the constituencies is not in 
our favour and all the others band together against us so that, in the second 
ballot, we cannot convert even substan tial minorities into majorities. I would 
rather that things carried on as they are until 1895 when we should be able to 
make an impact of a very different order, but no matter what happens 
everything, from Richter to Little Willy,a must needs help us on our way. 
A young man from Texas, F. Wiesen of Baird, wanted me to make a 
statement deploring the nomination of candidates ‘for President’ as a denial 
of the revolutionary principle, since the intention was to abolish the 
Presidency, I sent him the enclosed answer.b Should a garbled Version be

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 20 March 1893 
Dear Baron, 
Lessner’s articlea reads very well though it certainly cost Ede a vast 
amount of work to lick it into some sort of literary shape. As to the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung’s review, I once remarked—the notion suddenly came 
into my head—that it would be by no means a bad idea if the whole thing 
were to be reprinted en bloc and that this might be suggested to Dietz. On 
further consideration I realised, of c ourse, that there were sundry snags and 
that it would saddle me with more work than I could properly take on until 
Volume II P was finished, so I thought no more about it. But Lessner seems 
to throw himself into literature with the same impetuosity as once he did into 
painting. 
As a matter of principle I have ceased to read anything further on the rate 
of profit, not having read eith er little Schmidt’s second articlec or that by 
Lande.d These must wait until I get to th e preface to Vol. II I. In the 
meantime your irrepressible private adversary, Stiebeling, has again sent me 
his latest opus,e hoping—though probably in vain—that I shall accord it a 
kindly notice. 
As to the source of the nonsensical report about my illness, I am com-
pletely in the dark, but there was not  the least occasion for it. Nor can I 
discover where it first appeared or in what paper, so I have no clue whatever 
to go by. Still, we have cracked divers  bottles in honour of my serious loss of 
strength and my hourly awaited demise.f 
Five of the seven sections of Vol. II I have been finished but for the— 
formal—final editing; the main difficulty, the section on credit, 33 has

been overcome. I am now on renta which may take up yet more time, so I 
still can’t say when. This is between ourselves.  
Had I known that you were still prep ared to continue working on the 
Theories of  Surplus Valued, 102 I should have let you keep it, but having 
heard nothing for years and as I need the Ms. occasionally for purposes of 
comparison in connection with Vol. II I, I wrote asking you for it. In view of 
your other activities there would, after all, have probably been considerable 
uncertainty about when you might be done with this and subsequent 
instalments.b We shall settle this account shortly. 
The manifold plans regarding the Neue Zeit would seem to have been 
consigned to oblivion—let us hope it will carry on, even without such violent 
revolutions, But it still seems to me that  the fundamental shortcoming lies in 
the fact that the contents are aimed at one kind of reader, while the price is 
based on another.c 
Over here the movement is making excellent progress. The danger of 
sectarianism—presented both by th e Social Democratic Federation 44 and by 
the Fabians 43—has been largely averted; the Independent Labour Party 114 
will either absorb them or spur them on and get rid of their useless leaders. 
The masses, especially in the North, in the industrial areas, are finally and 
indubitably on the move. Blunders and dirty tricks there will still be in 
plenty, but that can be dealt with. The day before yesterday Aveling was in 
Manchester where the Executive of the Independent Labour Party were 
holding their first meeting. The resolutions were quite satisfactory. Aveling 
was chosen to represent it in Brussels 172 and later also in Zurich, 56 along 
with Keir Hardie and Shaw Maxwell.  No doubt you will be hearing more 
from Ede. (This is in confidence, of course; I don’t know what the chaps 
intend to publish.) 
Kindest regards.

Silbermannssohn,b and quite as depreciated as the metal he takes his name 
from) asking me for an ‘article’ {rien que ça!)c for his numéro uniqued of his 
May Journal; and that in the name of the Commission d’organisation de la

left; 2) Commission d’organisation, 108 rue du Temple, in a timber over the 
right, and 3) P. Argyriades himself, 49 rue de Rivoli over the leaf at the 
bottom. 
Well, as I am quite in the dark about the ins and outs, the amitiés, inimitiés 
et neutralitésf the various sets in Paris, I don’t know what to reply and should 
be glad if you would kindly tell me how our friends are placed with regard to 
the Commission d’organisation in general and the silvery Grec and his 
Blanquist friends in particular and what I had better do? As to an article, that 
is out of the question, at the very outside I should send him what the Yankees 
call a ‘sentiment’. 
And perhaps you can tell us at the same time when we may expect you 
here? which question reminds me of something else, namely of the necessity 
of not forgetting to enclose the cheque for ten pounds with which I remain, 
with love from Louise

Dear Comrade Radimsky, 
In reply to your esteemed note of the 18th inst., I can only tell you how 
glad I am that the Communist Manifesto will be appearing in Czech 
translation as well. 188 It goes without saying that, so far as I am concerned, 
there is absolutely no objection at all; on the contrary, it will give not only 
me but also Marx’s daughters the utmost pleasure. 
But if Adler told you that I have a ‘command’ of the Czech language, he 
was, so far as I am concerned, pitching it a bit high. I am happy if, with 
much toil and the help of a dictionary, I can understand one column in a 
newspaper. Nevertheless I much look forward to the numbers of the 
Délnické Listy you have been so kind as to promise me. They’ll help me to 
keep my hand in rather better. 
With cordial regards to the Czech  comrades and to you yourself.

ENGELS TO JULIE BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 31 March 1893 
Dear Mrs Bebel, 
August’s presence 183 has made me conscious of the shameful fact that I 
have long owed you an answer to your kind letter, so I have at once taken up 
my pen lest you should continue to ha ve cause to resent my tardiness. 
August, I can assure you, is exceptionally well and takes his raw eggs in 
brandy with admirable punctuality. The f act that his stomach is in excellent 
fettle was proved conclusively last evening at the Mendelsons and still more 
so later on at home, for after that good but truly enormous supper he slept 
more soundly than any of us. 
We are expecting Burns here today and thus, for the first time in history, 
three Socialist members of pa rliament from Germany, Francea and England 
will come together. That such a meeti ng should be possible, a meeting of the 
three deputies of the three leading parliaments of Europe—three Socialist 
Party leaders representing the three dominant nations of Europe—is in itself 
proof of what enormous advances we ha ve made. I only wish that Marx were 
alive to witness it. 
Well, now it is also time to remind you of your promise to visit us here in 
the summer and take me back with you to Germany. 189 True, August is 
afraid that a possible dissolution of the Reichstag might upset everything, but 
that is something I cannot see, for if there is in fact a dissolution, it will 
happen this month, i.e. in April (whi ch will be upon us tomorrow), while the 
elections will be held in June at the latest, 76 in which case a holiday will be 
more necessary than ever—for August as well as for yourself—and if you 
were to see the fine weather we have  here and all the greenness of spring 
which also brings with it a mass of flowers that lasts until the end of June, 
you would assuredly come, dissolutions and fresh elections or not. So, as 
always, I shall count on your keeping your word and shall also accompany 
you to Berlin, for since last autumn our respective trips have been 
indissolubly linked.

And now for yet another matter. August had taken it into his head to return 
on Monday.a But over the past ten years or so Easter Monday has become a 
proper holiday over here—one of the four so-called Bank Holidays. 190 It is a 
real popular festival. That being the case, all the railways are busy with extra 
trains and excursion parties, all the stations are filled to overflowing and all 
the regular trains are neglected by the management, since what matters is the 
extra profit. These Bank Holidays are th e only days in the year when it is 
somewhat dangerous to travel on Eng lish trains, and consequently no one 
travels on those days unless he has to. We therefore implored August to 
abandon his plan and not leave until Tuesda y, which he has promised to do. I 
am positive you will agree that he shoul dn’t travel on a day when arrivals 
and departures are never punctual a nd when all the accidents that didn’t 
occur during the previous three months have a habit of occurring all on one 
day. 
And now I shall take a hearty swig in honour of your coming visit—for 
we are at this moment enjoying our morning glass of ale. 
With warm regards, 
Yours,

wished to take the opportunity of consulting both Marx’s daughters per-
sonally about your inquiry. 
You are totally unknown not only to me but also to the Lafargues, and you 
will understand that it wouldn’t do to entr ust a total stranger with a matter as 
important and as difficult as the French translation of Volume II  of Capital.  
Apart from a thorough knowledge of the German language, it also calls 
for an equally thorough grounding in economics, and this, unfortunately, is 
to be found only very rarely amongst young socialists. That is something that 
would also have to be discussed beforehand. 
Next, you seek my collaboration—and on this score all I can say to you is 
that for years to come my time will be fully occupied with projects that are 
of at least equal importance. 
Most important of all, however, and this alone might give actuality to your 
inquiry, is that there should be a publisher for the translation. If you have 
one, that and nothing else would repay the trouble involved in taking the 
other questions into consideration. 
Yours very truly

Thank you for dropping the formalities. I, as you see, do the same. We

I am glad your life as a surveyor suits you so very well. It must be a great 
relief to you after the boring work in th e office and in the corn exchange of 
East Riding. I would like it for a short time too, but only for a short time. In 
the long run, I couldn’t live without the hum of a big town. I have always 
lived in big cities. Nature is wonderful.  I have always liked going back to her 
as a change from the movement of history, but History, after all, seems even 
more wonderful than Nature to me. It  took Nature millions of years to 
produce conscious beings and now it take s these conscious beings thousands 
of years to act together consciously; conscious not only of their actions as 
individuals, but also of their actions as a mass; acting together, and effecting 
in common a common purpose, willed by them in advance. That end we are 
now on the point of attaining. And to watch this process, this approaching 
accomplishment of a thing never before a ttained in the hist ory of our earth, 
seems to me a spectacle worth looking at, and for the whole of my past life I 
have been unable to turn my eyes away from it. However, it is tiring, 
especially if you believe you are called upon to co-operate in the process; 
and then the study of Nature comes in as a grand relief and remedy. For after 
all, Nature and History are the two components in which we live, move and 
have our being. 
Kind remembrance from all friends here. 
Ever yours F.

Dear Mr Mehring, 
Naturally I have not the slightest obj ection to your printing the passage 
from my letter of 28 September you copied out and sent me. All I would ask 
is that you make one change in the final sentence:

‘while the Lavergne-Peguilhenian genera lisation would be reduced to its true 
content, namely that feudal soci ety engenders a feudal world order’. 194 
The original wording is really too slipshod. 
I look forward to seeing the Lessing-Legende published on its own. That 
kind of thing is greatly impaired if brought out piecem eal. It was very 
meritorious of you to work your way through the tangled mass of Prussian 
history and to establish the correct correlations therein. The Prussia of today 
makes this absolutely essential, howev er disagreeable the work as such may 
be. There are various points, especially in this or that passage where you 
retrace the links with the preceding peri od, on which I do not entirely see eye 
to eye with you, but that does not prevent me from saying that yours is by far 
the best work that exists on this period of German history. 
Yours very truly, F.

My dear Laura, 
As for the last few days we have neither heard from you nor seen any 
papers with your handwriting on them, we are beginning to be anxious about 
your health, and the enclosed letter fro m Rave with the influenza atmosphere 
it breathes, is not encouraging either. It is this letter which puts the pen into 
my hands to-day. I don’t know anything about any of the points he mentions.

with what you have been good enough to do in the matter. Therefore

3. The proof-sheets are no use to me. I write to him 25 that I sent his letter 
to you, to settle all points, and that I shall be quite satisfied if he sends the 
proofs to you. 
I returned last night from Manchester, where I assisted at the funeral of 
poor Gumpert (he was cremated). He fe ll ill, as you heard while here, last 
December of angina pectoris, which, brought on embolism of the brain with 
partial paralysis, and succumbed last Thursdaya to a fresh attack, after fearful 
sufferings. 
May Day here is as confused as in Paris. The Eight Hours Committee and 
the Trades Council 197 are sure to have a separate demonstration each. And in 
this critical period Aveling falls ill, the Hull Dock Strike 198 intervenes and 
may lead to a general Dock and Shipping Strike all over the kingdom, giving 
Tussy more to do than she can manage—so that nobody knows how matters 
will go.

ENGELS TO LUDWIG SCHORLEMMER 
IN DARMSTADT 
London, 29 April 1893 
My dear Schorlemmer, 
I got your letter of 22 March and then the notification of your daughter’s 
death. Please accept my heartfelt c ondolences. Your earlier letters had 
already prepared me for it and from what you had said it was hardly to be 
expected that she would su rvive the spring. And if, as in your case, one is 
constantly a witness to the suffering caused by illness, while knowing that no 
remedy exists, one is bound in the end to resign oneself more readily to the 
final deliverance. Mrs Kautsky also asks me to convey to you her sincere 
condolences. 
Death has also claimed its victims over here. Last December Dr Gumpert 
suddenly went down with an incurable heart complaint and on the 20th of this 
month he died of it. Last Mondaya I attended the burial, or rather cremation, 
in Manchester. Unfortunately I had to get back the same day and thus missed 
the chance of looking up Siebold or Klepsch and could not therefore glean 
any further information on the subject of the estate. This is another matter 
that will be adversely affected by Gumpert’s death. He was an energetic man 
who, especially in the case of the ailing Siebold, managed successfully to 
hurry things on, and, in view of the friendly relations we had enjoyed for 
many years, was glad to be of help. I have heard absolutely nothing more 
about the manuscripts and publisher’s contracts. If you are unable to tell me 
anything about this, I shall write to Siebold again shortly. 199 
I recall having seen Dr Spiegel on one  occasion over here years ago. I 
think he will make a thoroughly good job of  Carl’s career and attainments as 
a chemist. 200 Unfortunately it wouldn’t do to publish anything more than that 
in a scientific journal. 
Your hopes for a dissolution of the Reichstag 76 will in all likelihood be 
fulfilled within the next week or fortnight. Caprivi has got himself into such 
a fix that he probably cannot concede as much as the gentle-

men of the Centre 71 and the Free Thinkers 149—who are bent on com-
promise—could consent to without imper illing the existence of their parties. 
I would rather that the dissolution were postponed until 1895; by that time 
we shall occupy a very different pos ition and may become the crucial party 
in the Reichstag. One way or the other, we’re bound to benefit by it. 
At Easter, or rather on Good Friday,a a German member of the 
Reichstag—Bebel—a French deputy—Lafargue—and an English member of 
parliament—Burns—Socialists all three—met for the first time at my house. 
A historical milestone too. 
With sincere regards from Mrs Kautsky and myself

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 186 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 17 May 1893 
Dear Sorge, 
The Lincoln affair happened while I was still in Manchester—at the 
end of 1864—but I have no more than a hazy recollection of it, nor, 
amongst Marx’s and my papers, have I ever set eyes on Lincoln’s reply. 201 
Maybe I shall come upon it tucked away somewhere, if ever I get round to 
sorting out and classifying the chaotic mass of stuff, but of that there can 
be no question unless I have three or four weeks to devote to it. All I can 
find is in Eichhoff’s pamphlet on the International, Berlin, 1868 (based 
on notes and material of Marx’s); p. 53 reads: 
‘Lincoln’s re-election on 8 November 1864 wa s an occasion for the General Council to 
send him an address with its best wishes. At  the same time, it called mass meetings in 
support of the Union’s cause. That was why Linc oln, in his message of reply, expressly 
acknowledged the services of the Internati onal Working Men’s Association for the good 
cause.’a 
In short, all I can say is that such material as I have on the International 
a W. Eichhoff, Die Internationale Arbeiterassociation... (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 361-
62). 
=====第167页=====
Letters- 1893 141 
Working Men’s Association before 1870 is very incomplete—some of the 
General Council’s minutes, Marx’s and Lessner’s, and also partly Becker’sa 
collections of newspaper cuttings and, finally, Marx’s letters to myself. I 
haven’t even got a complete set of the General Council’s official documents, 
proclamations, etc., let alone the correspondence of the secretaries who 
retained virtually all of it. There are no official Congress minutes at all. 
Nevertheless, it’s far better than anyt hing anyone else has got, and I shall 
classify it as soon as I can. But when? 
Volume II Ib is progressing steadily. I have reached the two final sec-tionsc 
and here too, I think, the worst is now behind me. But there’s still several 
weeks’ work to be done on them, afte r which I shall proceed to the final 
editing. I should like to send part of it to press before the summer holidays 
but don’t know whether I shall manage this. The final editing can be done 
while printing is actually in progress. And the matter is becoming urgent, for 
it looks as though we in Germany are about to enter a period of great turmoil 
and struggle which means that the thing has got to be finished before then. 
What my views are concerning German affairs you can see from the 
interview in Le Figarod which I am sending you by the same post as this. As 
in all interviews, the text has in parts become somewhat insipid and the 
thread sometimes gets lost, but otherwise it has been correctly reported. The 
morale of our people in Germany is alt ogether excellent; so far as they are 
concerned, the election campaign is a real boon and they revel in it, despite 
all the trouble and effort it costs them. Bebel, who spent a week here at 
Eastertime 183—after the Brussels Conference 172—is a new man and writes to 
say that; in addition to Hamburg, he ha s been asked to stand for Strasbourg in 
Alsace where in 1890 we had 4,800 votes as against 8,200, and where a lot of 
the Francophils will vote for him. There are between a hundred and a 
hundred and ten constituencies in which we shall be kicking off with more 
than one third of the total poll (to go by the 1890 results) and in some eighty 
of the constituencies we shall, I think, either get in straight away or else in 
the second ballot. How many will fall by  the wayside in the latter depends on 
the opposition candidate. Against Conservatives 202 or National Liberals 203 
our chances are very good, less so against Freisinnige 149 and still less so 
against the Centre

supposing our opponents’ ca ndidate sticks to his guns over the military 
question. 76 Bebel hopes for 50 or 60 seats in all. 204 
The atmosphere in Germany has changed a lot and, though the bourgeois 
press may still vociferate as loudly as  ever, the respect our people now 
command in the Reichstag has gained for them a position very different from 
before. Nor is it possible for anyone to  turn a blind eye to the ever-growing 
might of the party. If, at the next elec tions, we again show a marked increase, 
respect may grow on the one hand but so, on the other, will fear. And the 
latter will drive the wort hy philistines of one accord into the government 
camp. 
The May Day celebrations over here were very nice, but although they 
only happen once a year, they are alread y becoming almost a routine affair; 
they have lost their first bloom. Once again the narrow outlook of the Trades 
Council 197 and of the socialist sects—Fabians 43 and Social Democratic 
Federation 44—has led to our having two demonstrations. But everything 
went according to plan and we—the Eight Hour Day Committee—drew a far 
bigger crowd than the combined oppos ition. Our international platform, 205 in 
particular, was very well attended. I would estimate that there were in all 
240,000 people in the park, of w hom we had 140,000 and the opposition 
100,000 at the outside. 
Champion, with his TORY and LIBERAL UNIONIST funds 206 (allegedly £100 
for each of the 100 working-class candi dates agreeing to stand in hopeless 
constituencies merely in order to deprive the Liberals of votes), has been 
made a thorough fool of by our old friend Maltman Barry. This blockhead, if 
Scottish speculator, has joined the Tories of whom, by his own admission,a 
he is the paid agent, and would seem to have been planted alongside 
Champion, whom the fund-dispensing Tories do not altogether trust, as a 
sleeping partner and watchdog—what the Jesuits call a socius. Thus, during 
Champion’s illness, he was sole editor of the Labour Elector, and told such 
improbable tales out of school that he quite spoiled his own little game, thus 
temporarily saving the Independent Labour Party 114 from becoming the 
pawn of the aforesaid gentry. Unfortunately Aveling has been seriously ill 
for a month now; in view of the constant caballing that goes on here, he 
cannot well be spared. He has gone to Hastings 207 to recuperate for a while.

will have a favourable effect on the elections this autumn in France. 208 If our

Dr. Isaac A. Hourwich 
Dear Sir, 
Many thanks for your interesting study on the Economics of the Russian 
Village,a which I read, I hope, not without profit. 
As to the burning questions of the Russian revolutionary movement, the 
part which the peasantry may be effected  to take in it, these are subjects on 
which I could not conscientiously state an opinion for publication without 
previously studying over again the whole subject and completing my very 
imperfect knowledge of the facts of the case by bringing it up to date. 210 But 
for that I am sorry to say I have not at present the time. And then, I have 
every reason to doubt whether such a public statement by me would have the 
effect you expect of it. I know from my own experience of 1849-52 how 
unavoidably a political emigration splits itself up into a number of divergent 
factions, so long as the mother-country remains quiet. The burning desire to 
act, face to face with the impossibility of

doing anything effective, causes in many intelligent and energetic heads an 
over-active mental speculation, an attempt at discovering or inventing new 
and almost miraculous means of action. The word of an outsider would have 
but a trifling, and at best a passing effect. If you have followed the Russian 
emigration literature of the last d ecade, you will yourself know how, for 
instance, passages from Marx’s writings and correspondence have been 
interpreted in the most contradictory ways, exactly as if they had been texts 
from the Classics or from the New Testam ent, by various sections of Russian 
emigrants. Whatever I might say on the subject you mention, would probably 
share the same fate, if any attention was paid to it. And so from all these 
various reasons, I think it best for all whom it may concern, including myself, 
to abstain. 
Yours very truly F.

original brutal energy and moves onwards with a moderated step; even in 
France and Germany, this is to a certa in degree the case also; it is only in 
industrially young countries like America and Russia, that capital gives full 
fling to the recklessness of its greed. The consolation, however, lies in this: 
that by this very recklessness it hurries on the development of the immense 
resources of these young countries, and thereby prepares the period when a 
better system of production will be ab le to take the place of the old. 
In America, at least, I am strongly inclined to believe that the fatal hour of 
capitalism will have struck as soon as a native American working class will 
have replaced a working class compos ed in its majority by foreign 
immigrants.

a duffer par excellence, exceedingly diligent but no less superficial and 
muddle-headed for all that. 
I have just read Elie Reclus’ PRIMITIVE FOLK —what it is called in French I 
don’t know.b Here again, unparalleled muddleheadedness and pragmatism; 
moreover, his material is appallingly jumbled up so that one is often at a loss 
to know what tribes and peoples he is talking about; such material as might 
be of value is absolutely useless in  the absence of an accurate comparison 
with sources. Add to that the anti-theo logical prejudice of an anarchist who, 
on top of that, is a son of a Protesta nt clergyman. There is an occasional 
good, cynical observation. Valuable to Englishmen in so far as it flies in the 
face of their respectable preconceived ideas. 
The elections brought joy only to ourselves and to Caprivi. It’s too funny 
for words to see how the Centre 71 and the Free Thinkers, 149 the two parties 
most anxious to avoid a dissolution 76 because they were most afraid of the 
electorate, should now, after dissolution, be on the whole more afraid of the 
government and the possibility of conflict than they are of the electorate—so 
afraid, in fact, that, even before the elections, they have split into two sides of 
which one has come out squarely in fa vour of the government while the other 
still continues to vacillate. I must say, I had never imagined that progress 
towards the ‘one reactionary mass’ 214 would be so rapid. The resistance put 
up by the Richters and Liebers is, in f act, a very half-hearted and ineffectual 
affair and, should we gain the victories—in numbers of votes polled, seats 
being of lesser importance—which this disarray seems to promise, that 
resistance might collapse altogether. In which case we shall be the only 
opposition party, and then the fun can begin. 
It is strange how circumscribed all th ese ‘heddicated classes’ are by their 
social milieu. Such gasbags of the Centre and the Free Thinker Party as still 
remain in opposition represent farmer s and lower middle-class, if not 
actually working-class people of whose fury at the ever-increasing burden of 
taxation and the impressment of recru its there can be little doubt. Yet that 
popular fury is transmitted to thei r honourable deputies through heddicated 
organs, lawyers, merchants, parsons, schoolmasters, doctors, etc., men who, 
because of their more general education,  see a little bit further than the party 
masses and who have learnt enough to know that,

in a major conflict, they would be crushed between the government and 
ourselves. Hence they seek to avoid su ch a conflict and transmit the fury of 
the populace in muted form to the men in the Reichstag—let there only be 
compromise! Needless to say, they fail to see that this method of postponing 
the conflict propels the masses on to our side, i.e. gives us the strength, when 
the conflict comes, to fight it out to the finish. I expect to see a significant 
advance on the occasion of these elections—24 million votes, maybe 
more204—but many more still the next time! 
Caprivi’s joy, by the way, will be short-lived. If, as seems probable, his 
demand goes through, the masses will be driven over to us from the other 
side. And for a couple of years German y will doubtless be able to stand the 
strain of additional taxation, but this demand will not be the last. In a couple 
of years Russia may give the appearance of having recovered a little, 
whereupon the more will have to be de manded again and in that case even 
the one reactionary mass may be driven to seek another dissolution. All over 
Europe we are again coming into the revolutionary mainstream— vive la fin 
de sièclea! 
Bax’s sketches 215 are certain to cause you trouble. Though they have their 
moments, these are becoming increasingl y rare and the style as a whole is 
tailored to a local and, what’s more, pretty narrow readership consisting of 
Fabian 43 and other intellectuals. 
Your Berlin correspondentb has a pronounced subjective streak, but he can 
write, and has a good command of the materialist view of historical—though 
not, perhaps, always of current-events. His Lessing-Legende was quite 
excellent, although there are one or two points on which I would place a 
different interpretation. 
You can manage the Zurich Congress on your own. 56 My plans are not yet

Dear Sir, 
I regret that I am unable to comply with your request. 216 
In the first place, it so happens that  my party comrades in Germany are 
conducting an election campaign agai nst, among others, anti-Semitic 
candidates, 217 which means that at this juncture party interests preclude my 
expressing an impartial opinion about anti-Semitism. 
In the second place, I believe that my  party comrades in Vienna and in 
Austria generally would never forgive me were I to allow myself to be 
interviewed for the Deutsche Zeitung.  
I remain, Sir, etc.

Dear citizen Turati, 
Thank you very much for the information you were good enough to send 
me on the subject of the Domanico project. 218 I would very much like to 
reply to him as a young girl in Bellagio 219 replied to me more than fifty years

basi’ —’domani!’a Unfortunately that is impossible. He knows perfectly well 
that I am legally impotent in his case; he is not asking me for any 
authorisation, but simply suggesting that I associate myself in some way with 
his quite disinterested undertaking. As it is quite impossible for me to take on 
the revision of the translation (even if Domanico was willing to do it), I have 
no means of exerting pressure on him; I thought it was better for the moment 
to gain time and ask him for information; you will find at the end of this 
letter a copy of my reply to him.b 
Is the edition of Capital in the Economist’s Library in Turin to which you 
refer an Italian edition? I would be very interested in it, since that is 
something of which I have been unaware up till now; would you be so kind 
as to let me have the full title? and the name of the translator and the editor? 
so that I can get hold of a copy of this translation in order to say a few words 
about it in a new German editi on or in the preface to the 3rd volume. 
As for Deville’s resume, I have review ed the first part, but not the second 
half, the editor was too rushed. That is why Deville has sometimes presented 
as absolute theses of Marx which he had posited only as relative, as valid on 
certain conditions or with certain restrictions. However, that is the only fault 
I can find. 220 
The second edition of the 2nd volume of Capital will soon appear. I am 
reading the proofs of the last part, and it will not be long before it is pub-
lished. There are only the printing errors to be corrected, but in a book of this 
kind that is always important. 
Thank you for the translation of the Manifesto. 108

[Draft] 
[London,] 7 June 1893 
Dear citizen,a 
In reply to your kind letter of the 2nd of this month, I wish to thank you for 
letting me know of your intention to publish an Italian edition of Marx’s 
Capital. 218 
But before answering your various que stions, I have to know who is going 
to make translation and how, as this work is very difficult and demands of 
the translator both a profound knowledge  of the German and of political 
economy. 
The translation from the French edition alone wouldn’t be perfect as the 
Italian suits more the philosophic style of the author. 
I believe that the necessary means w ill be found to complete the work of 
such great importance and to publish a new edition that would be up to the 
contents of the book. 
Sincerely 
Yours,

Bulgarian Social-Demokrat. I, for my part, dare to count on your good will in 
asking you to forward the lines enclosed to his address.a If it is not too much 
to ask, I would be grateful if you would let me know, merely by postcard, 
whether I am mistaken in identifying Sevlievob as the town otherwise known 
as Philippopolis? I do not have a Bulgaria n dictionary, my Serbian dictionary 
offers no clarification, but I have the vague impression of having read 
somewhere that this was the Bulgarian name of this town. 222 If I am correct, 
you need not reply.

AT LE PERREUX 
London, 20 June 1893 
My dear Löhr, 
I was glad to conclude from your letter that there was still time to insert, 
in your Rave amendé et corrigé,a such of my suggested alterations 
a amended and corrected  
=====第180页=====
154 Letters- 1893 
as you approve of. 195 That was one of the reasons why I did not lay great 
weight on having the proofs here: once the matter mise en page,a it is 
difficult to insert alterations which necessitate either the cutting out, or the 
putting in, of a line or a few lines; at least in Germany I have had many a 
hard fight about the extra expence arising therefrom, and Mister 
Sonnenschein is careful to insert, in the agreement, a precise limit of what 
such alterations may cost extra. As to your two objects: to have a faithful 
translation, and one that should read as an original work, you have certainly 
attained them both and I am longing to read myself—without keeping one 
eye constantly on misprints and formal matters—again in your French: when 
I read it I said to Louise there is only one man in and about Paris that knows 
French, and that one is neither French nor a man but Laura. 
As to the Alsatian Rave I’ll forgive him his Alsatianism in consideration 
of his working-class countrymen; the 12,000 Muhausenb votes for Bueb, the 
6,200 Strasburg ones for Bebel (who is almost sure to get in there) and the 
3,200 Metz ones for Liebknecht, beside s odds and ends all over the country. 
Bebel who has been there several times lately is quite in love with the 
Alsatian working men and with the country altogether, although at Strasburg 
last Sunday fortnight they nearly smothered him bodily with their 
enthusiasm in Hammerle’s beer-garden. 
Our elections went off glorious. 204 In 1890—20 seats, now 24 carried at 
the first assault; in 1890—about 60 ballottage s, this time 85. Of seats we lost 
two and gained six new ones; of the 85 ballots, there are 38 in which, in 
1890, we did not get into the ballot (only the two candidates with the highest 
number of votes are admitted to ballot); and of the 85, there are also 38 in 
which we have chances (in the remaining 47 we are in a hopeless minority, 
unless miracles happen) and out of these 38 we may reasonably expect 25 
successful elections. But the gap cause d by the complete break-up of the 
Radical (Freisinnige) Partei 223 has created such a state of confusion that we 
must be prepared for a series of surprises; amongst the Radicals, party 
discipline has ceased to exist and the pe ople in each locality will just act as 
they think fit. By bringing up our full strength at second ballot by the 
assistance of the bourgeois democrats in South Germany and of the mutual 
jealousies and bickerings of the other parties, we shall be able to come up 
again to the old complement of 36, 
a is set up - b French name: Mulhouse  
=====第181页=====
Letters- 1893 155 
so that only for an increase above that number we shall be dependent on the 
active assistance of Radicals, Anti-Semites 217 and Catholics, 71 that is to say 
upon the strong anti-military current whic h pervades the peasantry and petty-
bourgeois class. 
But the number of seats is a very secondary consideration. The principal 
one is the increase of votes, and that is sure to be considerable. Only we shall 
not know it until the full official returns are placed before the Reichstag; the 
most important part of that increase will consist in the— relatively small—
number of votes cast in entirely new, remote country places, showing the 
hold we are beginning to take of those rural districts which were hitherto 
inaccessible to us and without which we  cannot expect to  be victorious. 
When they are all counted up, I still be lieve we shall have something like 2 
1/4 million votes, more than has ever been cast for any other party in 
Germany. 
Altogether, the effect has been stunning upon the whole of the German 
and English bourgeois press. And well it may be. Such a steady, unbroken, 
resistless progress of a party has never been seen in any country. And the 
best of it is that our increase of 1893 involves—by the extent and variety of 
the newly broken ground it shows—the certain promise of a far greater 
increase at the next general election. 
The new departure of the parti ouvriera with regard to ‘patriotism’ is very 
rational in itself 1’; international union can exist only between nations, whose 
existence, autonomy and independence as to internal matters is therefore 
included in the very term of interna tionality. And the pressure of the pseudo-
patriots, sooner or later, was certain to provoke an utterance of this kind, 
even without the alliance with Millerand and Jaurès 169 who no doubt have 
also urged the necessity of such an act. Guesde’s interview in the Figaro 224 
is excellent, not a word to be said against it. The address of the Conseil—
here I am interrupted. I shall have to go to the railway station. Mrs. Gumpert 
(you know Dr. Gumpert died a short time ago) is going to Germany and on 
the way going to stay a few days with us, and I must fetch her from the train. 
So I must say good-bye for a day or two, my observations on the address 
being of no great importance and no hurry whatever about them. Good luck 
to the everlasting traveller.c What a change has come over poor Clemenceau

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 27 June 1893 
My dear Lafargue, 
You were absolutely right to protest against the imbecilities of the 
anarchists and Boulangeo-Jingoes; 226 even though Millerand and Jaurès 
(who certainly preceded you in this matte r) contributed to this that does not 
matter. Particularly on the eve of a general election 156 it is impossible to 
leave the field wide open to slander. So we are agreed on this point; the 
Germans have done as much on more than  one occasion, to the great distress 
of Bonnier who moves in an idealistic anti-patriotic sphere (though mainly 
anti-patriotic for others, since no one wishes more than he that ‘France 
should take the lead in the movement’). And here is the National Council 
uncompromisingly declaring itself patriotic—and at the very moment when 
the elections in Germany 204 quite as uncompromisingly prove that it is not 
France which is taking the lead at present—poor Bonnier, he was here on 
Sunday, and looked quite abashed. 
Your declaration will have its effect  in France, I hope, and I hope with

equal fervour that it will go unnoticed in Germany. This is why: they are not 
grave matters, but I believe I should draw your attention to them to make 
sure you avoid them next time. 
I don’t want to speak of your use of the word patriot, of what you define 
as the only ‘true’ patriots. 
That word has a limited meaning-or else such a vague one, depending on 
circumstances-that for my part I shoul d never dare to apply that title to 
myself. I have spoken to non-Germans as a German, in the same way as I 
speak to Germans as a pure Internationalist; I think you could have achieved 
a greater effect if you had simply called yourself French—which is a 
statement of fact, a fact including the logical consequences which flow from 
it. But no matter, it’s a question of style. 
You are again perfectly right in extolling France’s revolutionary past, and 
to believe that its revolutionary past will find response in its socialist future. 
But it seems to me that, having reached that point, you incline a little too far 
towards Blanquism, i.e., towards the theory that France is destined to play the 
same role in the proletarian revolution (not merely that of initiator but also 
that of leader) as it played in the bourgeois revolution of 1789-98. This is 
contrary to the economic and political  facts of today. The industrial 
development of France has lagged behind th at of England; at this juncture it 
is behind that of Germany which has made giant strides since 1860; the 
working-class movement in France today cannot be compared to that of 
Germany. But it is not the French, nor the Germans, nor the British who, by 
themselves, will win the glory of having crushed capitalism; if France—
PERHAPS —gives the signal, it will be in  Germany, the country most 
profoundly influenced by socialism and where the theory has the most deeply 
penetrated the masses—where the fight will be settled, and even then neither 
France nor Germany will ensure final vi ctory so long as England remains in 
the hands of the bourgeoisie. Proletarian emancipation can be only an 
international deed; if you try to turn it into a purely French deed you are 
making it impossible. The exclusively French leadership of the bourgeois 
revolution—albeit inevitable, thanks to the stupidity and cowardice of the 
other nations—led to—do you know what?—to Napoleon, to conquest, to the 
invasion of the Holy Alliance. To try and assign the same role to France in 
the future is to distort the international proletarian movement, as, indeed, the 
Blanquists do, and make France look ridiculous, for beyond your frontiers 
such pretensions are made fun of. 
=====第184页=====
158 Letters- 1893 
And look where this leads you. You speak of 
France, at ITS immortal Paris Congress in 1889, 227 raised the banner, etc., etc.  
How you in Paris would laugh if the Belgians spoke of Belgium at ITS 
immortal Brussels Congress of 1891, 228 or Switzerland at ITS immortal 
Zurich Congress! 229 Furthermore, the actions of these congresses are actions 
neither French, Belgian nor yet Swiss, but international. 
Then you say: 
the French Workers’ Party 11 is at one with German Social-Democracy against the 
German Empire, with the Belgian Workers’ Party 230 against the Cobourg monarchy, with the 
Italians against the Savoy monarchy, etc., etc.  
There would be nothing against all that if you had added: and all these 
parties are at one with us against th e bourgeois Republic which oppresses us, 
Panamises us and ties us to the Russian tsar. After all, your Republic was 
made by old Williama and Bismarck; it is quite as bourgeois as any of our 
monarchist governments, and you mustn’t suppose that with the cry of ‘Long 
live the Republic’ on the day after Panama, 60 you will find a single supporter 
in the whole of Europe. The republican form is no more than the simple 
negation of monarchy—and the overthrow of the monarchy will be 
accomplished simply as a corollary to revolution; in Germany the bourgeois 
parties are so bankrupt that we shall pass at once from monarchy to the social 
republic. Hence you cannot go on opposing your bourgeois republic to the 
monarchies as something to which othe r nations should aspire. Your republic 
and our monarchies are all one in relation to the proletariatb; if you help us 
against our monarchist bourgeois, we shall help you against your republican 
bourgeois. It’s a case of reciprocity and by no means the deliverance of the 
downtrodden Monarchists by the gr eat-hearted French Republicans; this 
doesn’t tally with the international outlook and even less with the historical 
situation which has brought your republic to the feet of the tsar. Don’t forget 
that, if France makes war on Germany in the interests and with the help of the 
tsar, it is Germany which will be the revolutionary centre. 
But there is another very regrettable affair. You are 
‘at one with German Social-Democ racy against the German Empire’.

about alliance and international unity, it is necessary for this...’

This has been translated in the bourgeois press as gegen das deutsche 
Reich’.a And that is what everybody will s ee in it. For Empire means ‘Reich’ 
as well as ‘Kaisertum’ (imperial regime); but in ‘Reich’ the emphasis is laid 
on the central power as representing national unity, and for this, the political 
condition of their existence, the German Socialists would fight to the end. 
Never would we wish to reduce Germany to the pre-1866 state of division 
and impotence. Had you said against th e emperor, or against the imperial 
regime, no one could have sa id much, although poor Williamb is hardly of a 
stature to deserve being honoured in this way; it is the owning class, 
landlords and capitalists, which is the enemy; and that is so clearly 
understood in Germany that our workme n will not understand the meaning of 
your offer to help them to defeat the crackpot of Berlin. 
So I have asked Liebknecht not to mention your declaration insofar as the 
bourgeois papers do not do so; but if, ba sed upon this unfortunate expression, 
there were attacks on our people as traitors, it would give rise to a rather 
painful argument. 
To sum up: a little more reciprocity could do no harm—equality between 
nations is as necessary as that between individuals. 
On the other hand, your manner of speaking of the republic as a desirable 
thing in itself for the proletariat, and of  France as the chosen people, prevents 
you mentioning the—unpleasant but undeniable—fact of the Russian 
alliance, or rather the Russian vassalage. 
Well, that’s enough, I think. I hope I have convinced you that in the first 
flush of your renascent patriotism you have overshot the mark a little. Not 
that it is very important and I hope the thing will go by without raising a 
dust, but should it recur it might lead to unpleasant controversies. Your 
published documents, though intended for France, must also PASS MUSTER  
abroad. If it comes to that, our worthy Germans have not always been correct 
either, in all their expressions. 
As for the German elections, I am prouder of the defeats than of the 
successes. We have lost Stuttgart by a minority of 128 votes out of 31,000 
electors, Lübeck by 154 out of 20,000, and so on. On this occasion all the 
parties formed a coalition against us; even the democrats of the South, who 
left us in the lurch at Stuttgart, at Mannheim, at Pforzheim, at Speyer and 
voted for us only in Frankfurt. What we won we owe—for the first time— 
entirely to our own strength. Consequently the 44 seats are worth ten times

more than 100 won with the help of the liberals and democrats. 
Liberalism has completely abdicated  in Germany. There is no real 
opposition outside our Party. William will have his soldiers, his taxes and—
his Socialists in the army and outside the army, in ever-growing numbers. 
The final figure of the socialist vot es will not be known for 10-15 days;

My dear Lafargue, 
I am writing to Bebel and explaining the situation to him; 25 there are 
certainly many reasons in favour of a postponement of the Congress to a 
later date. 232 But 
1. November is out of the question, nobody goes to Zurich in winter when 
it is raining and cold. Further, your Chamber, the Reichstag and the British 
Parliament will be in session then. So give up that date. Another can be 
settled later. 
2. It would be regrettable if the French Marxists and the Germans, and 
they alone, proposed an adjournment. But it would be quite another mat-

what can be done in this regard, but do it quickly, for 
3. The Swiss will have to submit your request to the others and take their 
advice—at any rate they will plead th at necessity, seeing that Seidel, the 
secretary of the committee, 27 is a fanatical anti-Marxist and intrigues with all 
our opponents here and in France. 
You will have some difficulty in persuading the Blanquists 20 and the two 
kinds of Possibilists 30 to support your motion, but it is very important. If the 
others are satisfied with the dates 6-12 August, you are hardly likely to

ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI 
IN MILAN 
London, 12 July 1893 
Dear citizen Turati, 
On Saturdaya sent back to you, by registered mail, the Italian Capital.b 
Thank you. I have compared some passages, particularly in the 1st and 
penultimate chapters (general tendenc y of capitalist accumulation). As you 
say, it is translated entirely from the French text, which continues to be more 
popular than the German. The passages I compared were translated fairly 
accurately, which is not very difficult given that the two languages are so 
closely related, and the greater freedom of movement offered by Italian in 
comparison to French.

I noticed that the reverse of the title page carries the legend: proprietà 
letteraria,a which will prevent Domanico from using this translation as it 
stands. 218 I still have not received any repl y from him, perhaps he is begin-
ning to realise the difficulties involved in hi s undertaking. 
The ‘last part’ of which I spoke in my letterb is, of course, from the 2nd 
volume, 2nd edition, which will appear closer to September. The 3rd volume is 
still giving me trouble, but happily the e nd is in sight. However, I have not 
achieved my goal of finishing this work before my summer holidays. And 
that may cause a further delay of several months. 
As for the French edition of the 2nd and 3rd volumes, it would be rather 
difficult to find the translator they require. It’s a job which a few people 
would be willing and capable and persevering to bring to completion. The 2nd 
has 500 pages, and the 3rd will have 1,100-1,200. 
Poor Martignetti! Is there no way of rescuing him from this benedettoc 
hole of Benevento, and finding him some occupati on in a place where he 
could also learn the literary language of his country? He displays extraor-
dinary assiduity and willingness. He tr anslates for me with a fanaticism 
worthy of a better cause; but it seems he  has little success in business affairs, 
and an unlucky star has followed him everywhere. 
Will we see each other in Zurich? 189 Good Lord, if all goes well I might 
be able to be in Zurich at least for the last day of the Congress; that is my 
plan; however, as it does not entirely depend on me but on a combination of 
more or less fortuitous circumstances, it is very uncertain, and we would 
both probably do well not to speak of it. If there is something which frightens 
me, it is your threat to speak to me en Meneghino.d In 1841 I spoke it 
passably well, and understood it perfectly. 219 However, when, about thirty 
years later, I found myself at Como 233 for a day or two, I did not understand 
a single word; my ear had completely lost the habit. Thus I can say in all 
truth that I still speak a few words of your so very expressive dialect, but I 
understand nothing at all. As  for your French, it is still better than mine, and 
in any case nothing prevents you from writing to me in Italian. 
Do you read English? If you do, I could send you a newspaper from time 
to time.

ENGELS TO FRANZ MEHRING 234 
IN BERLIN 
London, 14 July 1893 
Dear Mr Mehring, 
It has taken me until today to get round to thank you for the Lessing-
Legende you were so kind as to send me. I did not wish merely to send you a 
formal note acknowledging receipt of the book, but also and at the same time 
to say something about it—its contents. Hence the delay. 
Let me begin at the end—with the appendix, ‘II ber de n historischen 
Materialismus’a in which you have brilliantly collated the essentials in a 
manner that must convince any impartia l reader. If I have any criticism to 
make, it is that you accord me more mer it than I deserve, even if one takes 
account of what I may, perhaps, have found out for myself—in course of 
time—but which Marx, with his swifter coup d’oeilb and greater discernment, 
discovered much more quickly. If one has been fortunate enough to spend 
forty years collaborating with a man like Marx, one tends, during one’s 
lifetime, to receive less recognition than  one feels is due to one; when the 
greater man dies, however, the lesser may easily come to be overrated—and 
that is exactly what seems to have happened in my case; all this will 
eventually be put right by history, and by then one will be safely out of the 
way and know nothing at all about it.

Otherwise only one point has been omitted, a point which, however, was 
never given sufficient weight by Marx a nd myself in our work, and in regard 
to which we are all equally at fault. For we all of us began, as we were bound 
to do, by placing the main emphasis on the derivation of political, legal and 
other ideological conceptions, as of the actions induced by those conceptions, 
from economic fundamentals. In so doing we neglected the formal in favour 
of the substantial aspect, i.e. the manner in which the said conceptions, etc., 
arise. This provided our opponents with a welcome pretext for 
misinterpretation, not to say distortion, Paul Barth being a notable case in 
point.a 
Ideology is a process which is, it is true, carried out consciously by what 
we call a thinker, but with a consciousness that is spurious. The actual 
motives by which he is impelled remain hidden from him, for otherwise it 
would not be an ideological process. Hence the motives he supposes himself 
to have are either spurious or illusory. Because it is a mental process, he sees 
both its substance and its form as deriving solely from thought—either his 
own or that of his predecessors. He wo rks solely with conceptual material 
which he automatically assumes to ha ve been engendered by thought without 
inquiring whether it might not have some more remote origin unconnected 
therewith; indeed, he takes this for granted since, to him, all action is induced 
by thought, and therefore appears in the final analysis, to be motivated, by 
thought. 
The historical ideologist (here historical is used as an omnibus term for 
political, legal, philosophical, theologi cal, in short, for all spheres ap-
pertaining to society and not merely to nature)—the historical ideologist, 
then, possesses in every sphere of scie nce a material which has originated 
independently in the thought of previ ous generations and has undergone an 
independent course of development of its own in the brains of these 
successive generations. True, external facts appertaining to one sphere or 
another may also have helped to de termine that development but according 
to what has been tacitly assumed, those facts, themselves are merely the 
fruits of a mental process, and thus we still find ourselves in the realm of 
pure thought which would appear to have  succeeded in assimilating even the 
most recalcitrant facts. 
What has above all deluded the majority of people is this semblance of 
a  P.  Barth,  Die Geschichtsphilosphie Hegel’s und der Hegelianer bis auf Marx und Hartmann. 
Ein Kritischer Versuch.  
=====第191页=====
Letters- 1893 165 
an independent history of political constitutions, legal systems and ideo-
logical conceptions in each individual sphere. When Luther and Calvin 
‘overcome’ the official Catholic faith, when Hegel ‘overcomes’ Fichte and 
Kant, or when, with his republican Contrat social, Rousseau indirectly 
‘overcomes’ the constitutionalist Montesquieu, the process is one which 
remains within the confin es of theology, philosophy  and political science, 
which represents a stage in the history of these spheres of thought and never 
emerges from the sphere of thought. And since the advent of the bourgeois 
illusion of the eternity and ultimacy  of capitalist production, even the 
overcoming of the Mercantilists by the Physiocrats and Adam Smith has 
come to be regarded merely as a victor y of the concept, not  as the conceptual 
reflection of changed economic facts, but as the correct perception, now at 
last achieved, of actual conditions as they have always and everywhere 
existed. If Richard Coeur-de-Lion a nd Philip Augustus had introduced free 
trade instead of becoming involved in the Crusades, we should have been 
spared five hundred years of misery and folly. 
We have all, I believe, neglected this aspect of the matter, which I can 
only touch on here, to a greater extent than it deserves. It’s the same old 
story—initially, form is always neglected  in favour of substance. As I have 
said, I, too, have done this, never rea lising my mistake until after the event. 
Far be it from me, therefore, to reproach you on that score—as the senior 
culprit I am in no way entitled to do so, quite the contrary—but rather I 
would draw your attention to this poi nt with a view to future occasions. 
Hand in hand with this goes the ideologists’ fatuous conception that, 
because we deny independe nt historical developmen t to the various ideo-
logical spheres which play a role in history, we also deny them any historical 
efßcacy. Underlying this is the ordinary, undialectical conception of cause 
and effect as rigidly opposite poles, quite regardless of any interaction. The 
gentlemen forget, often almost deliberatel y, that an historical element, once it 
is ushered into the world by other, ultimately economic, causes, will react in 
its turn, and may exert a reciprocal influence on its environment and even 
upon its own causes. Cf. Barth, for example, on the priestly caste and 
religion, your p. 475. 1 was delighted by the way you dismissed this quite 
incredibly superficial Johnnie. And they go and make the chap professor of 
history at Leipzig! Old Wachsmuth used also to be there; he too was not a 
little shallow-pated but he had a tr emendous feeling for facts—a very 
different sort of chap.

166 Letters- 1893 
For the rest I can only remark of this book what I said more than once 
about the articles when they appeared in the Neue Zeit, namely that it is by 
far the best account of the genesis of the Prussian state that exists, indeed I 
might even say the only good one, bei ng in most cases an accurate and 
minutely detailed exposition of correlati ons. One can only regret that, while 
you were about it, you did not feel able to include the whole course of events 
up till Bismarck; nor can one help hoping that you may some day do so and 
present the whole picture, from the Elector Frederick William to old 
William,a in context. You have, after all, already done the preliminary studies 
which you have all but completed at any rate so far as the essentials are 
concerned. And, after all, it has got to be done some time, before the rickety 
contraption collapses. The exploding of the monarchist-patriotic myths, if not 
exactly a necessary prerequisite for the elimination of that bulwark of class 
rule, the monarchy (a purely bourgeois republic in Germany having already 
become an anachronism before it has ever existed) is nevertheless one of the 
most effective means to that end. 
You would then also be better off as regards space and opportunity when 
you come to depict local Prussian history as part of the whole German 
misère. This is a matter upon which my views differ here and there from your 
own, notably as regards the conditions responsible for the dismemberment of 
Germany and the failure of the German bourgeois revolution in the 16th 
century. If I get round to revising the introduction to my Peasant War, as I 
hope to do next winter, I shall be able to enlarge on the points in question. 235 
Not that I consider those you adduce to be incorrect, but I should include 
some others and marshal them rather differently. 
I have always found, when studying German history—which is one long, 
continuous misère —that a true perspective can only be obtained by 
comparing it with the same periods in France, because what happens there is 
the exact opposite of what happens in Germany. There we have the 
establishment of the national state from the disjecta  of the feudal state at the 
very time of our worst decline. There, a rare kind of objective logic 
permeates the whole course of events; in our case, a barren and ever more 
barren haphazardness. There, the Englis h conqueror of the Middle Ages, who 
intervenes in favour of the Provençal nationality as opposed to North French 
nationality, represents foreign intervention; the English wars are, as it were, 
the equivalent of the Thirty Years’ War

which, however, ended with the ejection of foreign intervention and the 
subjection of the South by the North. Next comes the struggle between the 
central power and its Burgundian vassal,a supported by his foreign 
possessions and playing the part of Brandenburg-Prussia, a struggle which, 
however, ends in victory for the cen tral power and puts the seal on the 
establishment of the national state. 236 And at the selfsame time in Germany, 
the national state (in so far as the ‘German Kingdom’ within the Holy Roman 
Empire can be called a national state) collapses completely, and the 
wholesale plundering of German territory begins. It is a comparison that is 
exceedingly humiliating to Germans, but a ll the more instructive for that, and 
now that our working men have agai n placed Germany in the van of the 
historical movement, it may be somewhat easier for us to swallow the 
ignominy of the past. 
But what is of particular significance so far as developments in Germany 
are concerned is the fact that the two member states, which eventually 
partitioned the whole of the country be tween them, were neither of them 
purely German but were colonies on captured Slav territory—Austria a 
Bavarian, and Brandenburg a Saxon, colony; also the fact that they acquired 
power in Germany only with the support of foreign, non-German 
possessions—Austria with that of Hungary (not to mention Bohemia), 
Brandenburg with that of Prussia. Nothing of the kind happened on the 
western frontier, more at risk than anywhere else; on the northern frontier it 
was left to the Danes to protect Germany against the Danes, while in the 
South there was so little to protect that the frontier guards, the Swiss, were 
actually able to detach themselves from Germany! 
But I am divagating—my loquacity can, at any rate, serve you as proof of 
the extent to which your book has stimulated me. 
Once again, many thanks and warm regards from 
Yours,

ENGELS TO RUDOLPH MEYER 237 
IN PRUHONICE NEAR PRAGUE 139 
London, 19 July 1893 
Dear Mr Meyer, 
It is, I agree, quite interesting that those worthies the Conservatives should 
believe (desire) that Caprivi might destroy Social-Democracy. 238 Just let him 
try. A new Anti-Socialist Law 15 can only strengthen the party in proportion 
to the individual existences it destroys. Anyone who has got the better of 
Bismarck need have no fear of his successor. Any attempt to abolish or 
tamper with universal suffrage will re vive the old oracle: ‘If you cross the 
Halys, Croesus, you will destroy a great empire.’ If Caprivi does away with 
universal suffrage he will destroy a great empire, namely that of the 
Hohenzollerns. 
So you have found violations of the theory and practice of agriculture in 
Bebel’s Fraua? Well, it is scarcely possible to provide a critique of today’s 
wasteful and generally uneconomic mana gement of agriculture and industry, 
along with tips as to how, given the social order that automatically arises out 
of economic conditions, this could be done  differently and better, and at the 
same time as to how, given shorte r working-hours for each individual, 
production could be significantly increased—all this, I say, is scarcely 
possible without exposing oneself to attack by people with a practical 
knowledge of one branch or another. Hence Bebel is obviously either 
expressing himself badly or has failed to understand his authority when he 
says that the yield of a cornfield can be  increased threefold or more by fully 
exploiting the protein content of gluten. There can be no question of that. I 
could point to a dozen or more minor inaccuracies of a like nature, but they 
don’t affect the main issue. 
Similarly in the case of the trans port of meat from regions overseas. 
Hitherto enough has been available for shipment in one form or another to 
Europe. But with growing demand and a growing tendency to change over 
from pasture-land to arable—in those regions too—this is bound to

reach a peak before long and then d ecline. Whether it comes about a few 
decades sooner or later is largely immaterial. 
However, the main objection you raise is that work on the land cannot be 
done by industrial labour and that in agriculture the reduction of the working-
day to a uniform period throughout the year is impossible. Here you have 
misunderstood Bebel the turner. 
So far as hours of work are concerned, there is nothing to prevent us from 
taking on at seed or harvest time, or whenever a quick supply of extra labour 
is needed, as many workers as may be required. Assuming an eight-hour day, 
we can put on two, even three, shifts a day, Even if each man were to work 
only two hours a day—in this special employment—eight, nine or ten shifts 
could be put on in succession, once we had a sufficiency of people trained in 
the work. And that and nothing else is what Bebel is saying. Similarly, in 
industry one wouldn’t be so thick-headed, assuming a two-hour shift 
engaged, say, in spinning, as to keep increasing the number of spindles until 
each spindle produced what was requi red of it when run for two hours. 
Rather, one would keep the spindles running for between ten and twelve 
hours, while the operatives would only work for two, a new shift being put on 
every two hours. 
Now as to your objection about the poor town dwellers who are spoiled for 
agricultural work for life, you may ve ry well be right. I readily admit my 
inability to plough, sow, reap, or even lift potatoes, but luckily we have in 
Germany so huge a rural population that by intelligent management we could 
without more ado drastically redu ce each man’s working hours and still 
retain supernumeraries. Supposing we turned the whole of Germany over to 
farms of between 2,000 and 3,000 morgensa—more or less, depending upon 
natural conditions—and introduced machinery and every modern 
improvement, would we not then ha ve more than enough skilled labour 
amongst the agricultural population? But obviously there is not enough work 
on the land to keep that population busy throughout the year. Large numbers 
would idle away much of their time if we didn’t employ them in industry, 
just as Our industrial workers would waste away physically if they were 
denied the opportunity of working in the open air and particularly on the 
land. I agree that the present grown-up generation may not be up to it. But we 
can train young people to that end. If, for several successive years, the lads 
and lasses were to go into the

country in summer when there is something for them to do, how many terms 
would they have to spend cramming befo re being awarded their doctorates in 
ploughing, harvesting, etc.? You are surely not suggesting that a man should 
spend his whole life doing nothing else, that, like our peasants, he should 
work himself silly before he acquires some useful knowledge of agriculture? 
And that and that alone is what I infer from Bebel’s book when he says 
that production itself, as also a person’s training, both physical and mental, can be 
brought to its highest level only when the old division of labour betw een town and country, 
between agriculture and industry, has been done away with.  
Now as to the question of the profitability of the large estate as against 
that of the small farm, this can, in my view, be simply explained by the fact 
that in the long run the large estate engenders the small farm just as much 
and just as inevitably as the latter, in its turn, engenders the former. In 
precisely the same way as cut-throat  competition gives rise to a monopoly 
and vice versa. This cycle is, however, inextricably bound up with crises, 
with acute as well as chronic distress, with the periodically recurring ruin of 
whole sections of the population, and likewise with the vast dissipation both 
of the means of production and of what is produced. And since we have now 
fortunately reached a stage at which we can dispense with these worthies the 
big landowners no less than with the landed peasants, and agriculture, no less 
than industry, has likewise now reached  a stage of development which, in 
our view, not only admits of, but demands, its appropriation en bloc by 
society, it is up to us to break the circulus vitiosus.a To that end the big farms 
and large manorial estates provide us with a much better opportunity than the 
small farms, just as in industry large factories are more readily suited to that 
purpose than small workshops. And this is  reflected in the political sphere in 
that the rural proletarians on the big estates become Social-Democrats, just 
like the urban proletarians, once the latte r are able to exert pressure on them, 
whereas the unsuccessful farmer and urban artisan arrive at Social-
Democracy only by the devious route of anti-Semitism. 217 
To say that the owner of a manorial estate— LORD or SQUIRE —who has 
emerged from feudalism, will ever learn to run his affairs as would a 
bourgeois and, like the latter, be capable of regarding it as his first duty, 
come what may, to capitalise each y ear a proportion of the surplus value 
a vicious circle

secured—such a statement runs counter to all experience in all previously 
feudal countries. When you say that these gentlemen are compelled by 
necessity to stint themselves of much that goes with the way of life appro-
priate to their station, I quite believe you. But that they can ever learn TO 
LIVE WITHIN THEIR INCOMES AND LAY BEYOND SOMETHING FOR A RAINY DAY is  
quite outside my experience. It has neve r yet happened, or at most by way of 
an exception, and certainly not in the case of the class as such. After all, 
these people have existed for the past two hundred years thanks solely to the 
assistance of the state which has seen them through every crisis...

London, 20 July 1893 
My dear Löhr, 
D’aborda thanks for translation of the Chronicle Interview—though it was 
hardly worth while. 239 And then an inquiry. 
Some time ago Bonnier sent me a letter from a Diamandy (Roumanian) 
asking me to write for a new Reviewb of his and announcing me that they had 
anticipated my permission and translated for the 1st No., which they would 
send, the chapter on Barbarism and Civilisation. 240 I waited but received 
nothing. Then, a few days ago, I wrote, saying that I had not had the review 25 
but anyhow had no time to write for him.

After that they send to me a Separatabdrucka of that chapter stating on the 
cover that they intended publishing the whole first in the review and then in 
book-shape. But the review they did not send to me, but to Tussy. From her I 
got it this afternoon and see that I am quoted as a regular contributor along 
with Kautsky, Paul, and others who pe rhaps were not asked any more than 
myself—that however articles by Guesde and Paul are promised and Paul’s 
essay on Mohr’s Materialismb is reprinted in part.—The translation of my 
chapter seems to be Roy’s. Now, all that, along with Léo Frankel as 
administrateur, opens out before my bewildered eyes such a vista of 
possibilities and impossibilities that before taking another step in the matter I 
must seek information and advice at your door. Paris is unberechenbar,c but 
Paris doublé de Bucarest becomes a mystery in the third power, and I give it 
up. 
What funny people the French government and Parliament are! Panama 60 
passes off with a fizz instead of an explosion, the coup d’état against the 
bourse du travaild leaves the workpeople blasés and passes off quietly, but the 
Siamese humbug sends the very same parliamentary patriots off in a blaze of 
enthusiasm for Colonial Conquest—the same men who a few years ago 
almost killed Ferry ‘the Tonkinois’ because he tried to engage them on the 
same line! 241 Verily the bourgeoisie has outlived itself everywhere. 
To-morrow Louise and I are going, for a week, to Eastbourne (address as 
before, 28 Marine Parade), as I feel the want of a little recruiting of strength 
before undertaking my trip to Germany. 189 Last year’s disappointment has 
made me careful; I don’t want to be laid up again lame in an armchair for six 
weeks. We leave Eastbourne Friday 28th July and London for Continent 1st 
August—meet Bebel and wife in Cologne and go via Strasburg to 
Switzerland where I shall meet my brothere and expect to be in Zürich for 
close of Congress 12th or 13th August. Thence with Bebel to Vienna and 
Berlin. 
Will Paul and you be in Zürich? The Swiss got letters from other Parisian 
organisations, that the elections very likely would not be in August, in spite 
of all newspaper reports, but only in September; 156 that and the English 
objections decided against the application for adjournment. 232 
Post-time—9 o’clock, though perhaps th is will not reach you till Saturday 
morning!

ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI 242 
IN MILAN 
London, 20 July 1893 
Dear citizen Turati, 
I hasten to reply to your letter of 17th, which I received yesterday evening. 
Mme Marx-Aveling is executor under Marx ’s will; as for the literary part 
of the inheritance, I am responsible. Neither of us has ever heard talk of any 
Unione tipografica-editrice of Turin, and even less have we ever sold to this 
society ‘property rights for the works of Marx’ which (fortunately) belong to 
us entirely to this day. Not a single soldo of money from this Union has ever 
touched our hands. 243 
As regards the 1st volume of Capital, these property rights include the 
German and French editions. In accord with the relevant international trea-
ties, everyone is now free to do any translations; we cannot oppose this. If 
anyone asks for our authorisation, this is a purely voluntary act on their part. 
It is not altogether impossible that the Union has entered into some kind of 
contract with the editor of  the French edition, M. Lachâtre, but it is highly 
unlikely. I know nothing of it. However, even if this is the case, M. Lachâtre 
could only. sell that which is his property, and at the very most that was the 
French edition. Thus the Union could do no more than oppose an Italian 
translation from the French. 
However, now the book by Deville has been published and is freely 
circulating in France. If in France no one has attempted to bring a charge 
=====第200页=====
174 Letters- 1893 
of infringement of copyright against this book, then there is even less chance 
of anyone trying something of the kind. 
Thus it is ridiculous, unless the legislation in Italy is wholly out of line. 
However, as the Code Napoléon has served as the basis for civil legislation 
in almost the whole of Western Europe, I do not think I am mistaken to see 
the case from this point of view. 
What is amusing is the affrontery of  these gentlemen: ‘we purchased from 
the heirs to this property, etc’ Clearly  they have succeeded in this on other 
occasions. 
As for Zurich, the situation is still as it was when I last wrote to youa; let 
us all hope for the best!

comrades in arms, it takes our thoughts back to the old days, to the old 
battles and assaults, to the defeats at the beginning and the eventual victories 
we have experienced together, and we re joice that in our advancing years we 
have not been destined to remain in the self-same breach—after all, we have 
long since gone over from the defence to a general attack— but rather to 
advance together in the same line of battle. Yes, old man, many are the 
assaults we have been in together a nd I hope we’ll be in more of them to 
come including, if all goes well, the one which, if it does not bring the final 
victory, will nevertheless make th at victory a foregone conclusion. 
Fortunately both of us can keep our spirit up and both of us are spry for our 
age, so why shouldn’t we manage to do so? 
Bebel will be giving you and your wife on our behalf—Louise Kautsky’s 
and mine—a small memento of your celebration, which I trust you will 
kindly accept and remember us by. 
With cordial regards and good wishes from

ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT 
IN BERLIN 
Eastbourne, 27 July 1893 
Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
I was delighted to receive the pictur e of the house in Bruch where I was 
born and spent my childhood. 244 The photograph is a very good one and 
shows every detail with which so many of my memories are associated. It 
was very nice of Liebknecht to have it taken, and I would ask you to thank 
him most kindly on my behalf.

Provided there are no upsets I shall be visiting Berlin in September for a 
couple of days when I shall have the pleasure of greeting all of you again. In 
order to fortify myself somewhat for the long journey, 189 have been 
spending a few days here by the sea, 245 greatly to the benefit of Mrs Kautsky 
and myself. We return tomorrow. 
It is typical of the Prussians to persecute your Karl in this way; the

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS 
IN THUSIS (GRAUBII NDEN) 
6 Merkurstrasse, Hottingen-Zürich 16 August 1893 Dear Hermann, 
I have been staying with Anna Beust since yesterday and am at last 
sufficiently far removed from the turmoil to be able to write to you. 189 I had 
quite a nice journey. There were some highly diverting dust storms to begin 
with, followed by just enough rain to make the dust stick to one’s clothing. In 
Zürich they took me to the Hotel Ba ur en ville where I was very well 
accommodated but never felt at home. Th en, finally on Saturday evening, 
with the most difficult part accomplishe d, a moderate carousal gradually got 
under way (I say moderate advisedly; only half litres were served) combined 
with excursions on the lake. Tell Elsbetha that people here have already 
discovered how talented I am at growling. The other day Bebel remarked in a 
postcard that I had done nothing the whole evening but growl with 
contentment. 
Zurich has come on a great deal and outdoes even Barmen. There ev-

ery third house used to be an ‘inn’; here, however, there are three inns to 
every two houses. The Beusts live in very pleasing style with a wonderful 
view from a gigantic balcony big enough to hold a ball on. Anna Beust is 
very well preserved and one of the most beautiful old women in existence, 
besides being witty and vivacious, clever, energetic and resolute; it is a 
pleasure to be with her. Her son Fritz is in charge of the school, while the 
other, Adolf, has a very good medical practice; both have nice wives and two 
noisy, lively boys apiece. Adolf lives at  home and Fritz close by in a house 
he has built. 
Next week I shall probably go into the mountains for a while with Bebel. 
However I shall be back in about a week or so, and round about the 3rd, 4th or 
5th of September we are leaving for Munich and Vienna. 
At the Congress 56 there were three or four Russian women with really 
lovely eyes, somewhat reminiscent of your sister-in-law Berta’sa when I saw 
her in Altenahr years ago. But my real sweetheart was a truly delightful 
Viennese factory girl,b charming of countenance and engaging of manner, 
such as one rarely comes across. I sh all never forgive Bismarck for having 
excluded Austria from Germany, if onl y because of the Viennese women. 
From what they tell me here, the Hotel Bellevue is not one of the best. I 
hope it nevertheless suited you all right. Let me know sometime how you got 
on. With much love to Emma,c Elsbeth, Walterd and you yourself from your 
old ‘weed that never dies’.

By the way, you might also pay a call on Anna Beust. She has not set eyes 
on or heard from you for ages.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
Merkurstr. 6, Zürich-Höttingen  
21 August 1893 
My dear Löhr, 
I have been in Switzerland for some weeks. 189 Louise, Dr. Freyberger and 
I left August 1st via Hook of Holland, met Bebel and his wife at Cologne, 
passed one night at Mainz, the next at Strasburg, the third at Zürich. Thence I 
went to Thusis in Graubünden where I met my brother 11and family and 
stayed a week, returned to Zürich just in time for the closing of the congress 
and am now staying with my cousin Mrs. Beust. 
As to the elections of yesterday, 208 we are in complete uncertainty and 
shall be so until this afternoon—no pa pers being published in Zürich on 
Monday mornings. So anything to be said on that subject must be delayed 
until end of this letter. 
I found Germany completely metamorphosed. Steam chimneys all over 
the country, but where I passed, not numerous enough over a small district, 
to create a nuisance by their smoke. Cologne and Mainz are transformed. 
The old town is there still where it was,  but around or aside of it has arisen a 
larger and newer town with splendid buildings disposed according to a well-
arranged plan, and with large industrial establishments occupying distinct 
quarters so as not to interfere with the aspect or the comfort of the rest. 
Cologne has made most progress, having nearly trebled its inhabitants—the 
Ring is a splendid street, there is nothing equal to it in all England. Mainz is 
growing, but at a slower rate. In Strasburg you see too distinctly the 
separation between the old town and the new district formed by university 
and government buildings, an external  addition, not a natural growth. 
Paul naturally will be most curious to  hear about Alsace. Well, the French 
may rest satisfied. In Strasburg, to my astonishment, I heard nothing but 
German spoken. Only once, two girls, Jewesses, who passed me,

spoke French. But this is very deceptiv e. A very intelligent young Socialist, 
who lives there, told me that as soon as you go outside the city gates, the 
people speak, and purposely, nothing but French. In Mülhausen 3 too, he said, 
4/5ths of the population, working men and all, speak French. Now this was 
not the case before the annexation. 247 Since the railways were opened, the 
French language began to spread in the country districts, but even now the 
French they speak is to a great extent of their own manufacture. But anyhow 
it is French, and shows what the people want. When the annexation took 
place, I once said to Mohr: the cons equence of all these attempts at 
regermanisation will be that more Fren ch will be spoken in Alsace than ever 
before. And so it has turned out. The peasant and workman stuck to their 
German dialect as long as they were Frenchmen; now they do their utmost to 
shake it off and speak  French instead. 
Such arrant fools as these Prussian s you never saw. They flattered the 
nobility and bourgeois who, they ought  to have known, were hopelessly 
frenchified, and bullied the peasants and workmen, who, at least in language, 
had retained some remnant of German  nationality. The country is under the 
thumb of maires,** gendarmes, tax-gatherers, appointed by the central 
government and mostly imported from abroad, who do as they like and live 
among themselves, separated from and detested by the people. 
All the old oppressive laws of the French Second Empire 248 are scrupu-
lously maintained and enforced, and sometimes even improved upon by old 
ordinances dating from the ancien régime and unearthed by learned 
functionaries who have discovered that the revolution has forgotten to state 
expressly that they are repealed! Mo reover, all the chicanery innate to 
Prussian officials, is imported and improved upon. The consequences are 
natural. When I asked my friend: then , evidently, if the French by some 
chance or other were to return, nine-t enths of the people would receive them 
with open arms, he said that was so. 
In Strasburg the old bourgeoisie keep quite to themselves and do not mix 
in any way with the intruders. With the rest of the people, Bebel is very 
popular, wherever he was recognised, they came to the shop doors and 
saluted him. You may be sure he will bring the state of things in Alsace 
before the Reichstag in a fashion different from that of those asses of 
protestataires who seem to rejoice in every fresh measure of oppression,

for fear the people might get reconciled with the new régime, and who 
consequently have lost the best part of their hold on the population. In this 
case as in every other, it will turn out that our party is the only one that can 
and will do what is really wanted. 
(This moment a telegram from Roubaix to Greulich’s house that Guesde 
is elected. Hurrah! Hope to hear this afternoon about Paul’s victory. 249 
As to the Congress 229 it was a pity that our people had not at least 5-6 men 
here. 250 The one effect has been obtained: Blanquists 20 and Allemanists 21 
have made themselves eternally ridiculous and contemptible devant le monde 
socialiste.a But now this falls on French socialism generally; now the others 
speak simply of ‘the French’, and that is very unlucky indeed. Had there been 
even a small minority of Marxists, that would not be the case. But if you find 
in English and continental socialist papers the French Socialists treated as a 
set of chaps who do not know their own minds for two minutes together, and 
who will vote by acclamation the greates t piece of nonsense if thereby they 
think they can aggravate ‘les allemands’,b You need not be astonished. I have 
heard Swiss Socialists (and the German Swiss have very strong French 
sympathies) declare that now it was evid ent that chauvinism was ineradicable 
in the French mind, and I had to tell them what things—gall and wormwood 
to every chauvinc- had been able to say in French in your Almanac,d without 
any bad results anywhere. So you see the fiasco of these spouters falls upon 
all France, our people included. And Jaclard with his peevish articles in 
Justice makes it worse still. Well, I hope the elections will put us in a 
position to show to all Europe that Jaclard and Allemane ne sont pas la 
France.e And yet I believe Jaclard voted in very many cases with Bonnier and 
the small vanishing minority. 
The women were splendidly represented. Besides Louise, Austria sent 
little Dworzak, a charming little girl in every respect; I fell quite in love with 
her and whenever Labriolaf gave me a chance, eloped with her from the 
entanglements of his ponderous conversation. These Viennoises sont des 
Parisiennesnées, mais des Parisiennes d’il y a cinquante ans.g Regular 
grisettes. Then the Russian women, there were four or five with wonderfully

work and her slightly hysterical enthusiasm, but I like her very much. She 
has ascended the Glärnisch, a mountain full of glaciers, a very severe effort 
for a woman of her constitution. Altogether I had the happy lot to fall from 
the arms of one into those of the next and so on; Bebel got quite jealous— 
he, the man of the ‘Frau’,a thought he alone was en titled to their kisses! 
Now I leave a bit of room for this afternoon’s news. The Beust boys wish 
to be remembered. Louise is in Austria, Bebel and Bernstein are still here. 
By 4th September Bebel and I are off to Vi enna, up to then the above address

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
Zürich, 31 August 1893 
My dear Löhr, 
Thanks for your letter and the papers which came to hand yesterday. I had 
been for 6 days in the Berner Oberland with August and St. Mendelson—
fine weather and splendid scenery. 189 The Jungfrau had put on an extra clean 
white night-dress for us. Jungfrau, Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa are the three 
finest massifs of the whole Alps. 
Yesterday we were on the Uetliberg, a hill close to Zurich, with a fine 
though rather distant view of the snowy chain. When, after 1870, old Thiers 
was here with his lot, he at once explained the whole to them; pointing at the 
Glärnisch (due South-East of the Uetli) he said that was the Mont Blanc. The 
landlord of the hôtel at the top, a perfect connoisseur of the whole range, 
ventured to suggest that this was the Glärnisch, and that the Mont Blanc was 
in a nearly opposite direction, and i nvisible from that point—but the little 
man replied: Monsieur, je suis Adolphe Thiers, et je dois savoir cela! C’est 
bien là le Mont Blanc!a 
I am glad you consider the re sult of the elections of the 20th a victory. Let us 
hope this will be confirmed next Sunday by the return of Paul and Delcluze 
besides some others. Otherwise I am afraid our party will not be able to play 
the part in the Palais Bourbon 156 which I and many others wish it to play. If 
a Sir, I am Adolphe Thiers and I should know this! I can assure you that is Mont Blanc!  
=====第211页=====
Letters- 1893 185 
we have 8-10 men there, they will form a nucleus strong enough to force the 
Blanquists, 20 Possibilists 30 and Independent Socialists to group themselves 
around it and thus to prepare a united party. But if we are only 3 or 4, the 
other fractions will each be about as strong, and unificati on will not only be 
more difficult, but also have more of the character of a co mpromise. Therefore 
I hope we may enter the Palais Bourbon in full force. 
I hope the Socialiste will not bring Guesde’s letter to his electors.a 
Whatever may be thought of it in France, outside the border it would sound 
simply grotesque. To declare his election a revolution, by which socialism 
fait son entrée au Palais Bourbon,b and from which a new era dates for the 
world in general, is coming it rather too strong for ordinary mortals. 
I enclose a German five mark note, to  enable you to telegraph to us the 
result of the poll next Sunday. 208 August and I are leaving here on Monday 
morningc for Munich and shall stay there over Tuesday. Now by Monday 
evening or Tuesday morning at latest we suppose you will have all the results 
as far as they interest us. As soon as you can, but not later than Tuesday 
afternoon, please telegraph the names of our men and the places for which 
they have been returned, and if the money goes so far, any further 
information of interest. The telegram to be addressed in German: 
Bebel, Hotel Deutscher Kaisert Munich: but the rest had perhaps better be 
in French, so as to secure correct sending off. 
On Tuesday evening or Wednesday we shall go on to Salzburg, thence to 
Vienna where we stay for a few days, and then to Berlin. If you will be good 
enough to send some further information by  letter to Vienna (where it can be 
used for the Arbeiterzeitung) please address to Frau L. Kautsky, 
Hirschengasse 46, Oberöbling, Vienna , Austria. (An inner cover is un-
necessary as she will know it is for me.) 
And now good luck to all our candidates and to Paul especially! I put little 
trust in the promises of opportunists, 87 but I hope that in his case they may 
turn out true for once . 252 
What benefit has the Millerand-Jaurès alliance 169 brought to us in this 
campaign? I am utterly unable here to form a judgment. 
Love from yours ever,

Berlin W., den 18 September 1893  
Grossgörschen- Strasse 22 a. 
 My dear Lohr, 
Enfin!a Arrived here Saturday night, after 6 days in Vienna and 1 in 
Prague 189 (where we met your old adorer Rudolf Meyer). Vienna is an 
extremely beautiful town, with glorious boulevards (Ringstrasse), and the 
immense square between Rathhaus and—vis-à-vis—new Burgtheater, with 
Parliament to the right and University to the left, is unequalled in the world. 
But Vienna is too big for its people, they are only beginning to learn the use 
of these boulevards; in about 10 years everything will be ten times finer, 
because 10 times more alive with people. 
Altogether the Continent has undergone a complete revolution since I last 
saw it. 254 Everywhere life, activity, development, compared to which 
England appears stationary. Of Berlin I have not seen much (not a square 
foot as yet of the Berlin I left in 1842, 255 as what I have seen so far, is all 
new addition) but it is indeed externally splendid, though, I fear, internally 
full of discomfort. Bebel (where Louise and I are staying) has a very pretty 
and comfortable floor, but Libraryb where we spent last evening lives in a set 
of apartments so awfully arranged by the builder that it horrified me. Here in 
Berlin they have invented the ‘Berlin er Zimmer’, a room with hardly a trace 
of a window, and that is where the Berliners

spend almost all their time, To the front is the dining-room (best, reserved for 
swell occasions) and the salon (even mo re select and reserved), then the 
‘Berliner’ Spelunkea; next a dark corridor, a few bedrooms donnant sur la 
cour,b and a kitchen. A sprawling unhomely arrangement, specifically 
Berlinerisch (that is bourgeois-berlinerisch): show and even splendour in 
front, darkness, discomfort and bad a rrangement behind, the front for show 
only, the discomfort to be lived in. At all events that is my impression at 
present; let us hope it may get mended. 
Yesterday we were in the Freie Volksbühne 256—the Lessing Theater, one 
of the nicest and best of Berlin had b een hired for the occasion. The seats are 
drawn for as in a lottery by the subscribers and you see working men and 
girls in the stalls and boxes, while bourgeois may be relegated to the gods. 
The public is of an attention, a devotion, I might say, an enthusiasm sans 
égale.c Not a sign of applause until the curtain falls—then a veritable storm. 
But in pathetic scenes—torrents of tears. No wonder the actors prefer this 
public to any other. The piece was rath er good and the acting far superior to 
what I had expected. The Kleinburgereid of old has disappeared from the 
German stage, both in the acting and in the character of  the pieces. I will 
send you a short review of the latter. 
In Vienna I had to appear  twice before the ‘party’. 257 I am quite enchanted 
with them. As lively and as sanguine as the French, but slightly more solid. 
The women especially are charming and enthusiastic; they work very hard, 
thanks, to a very great extent, to Louise. Adler has done wonders; the tact, 
the constant vigilance and activity, with which he holds the party together 
(not an easy thing with such lively people as the Viennese), are beyond 
praise, and if you consider moreover the difficulties of his private position—
a wife ill with nervous ailments, thr ee children and interminable pecuniary 
difficulties arising therefrom—it is almost inconceivable how he can keep his 
head above water. And these Austri ans—a mixture of all races, Celtic, 
Teutonic, Slavonic—are far less manageable than our North Germans. 
Library looks very well, collecting the elements of a paunch; his wife 
made a Bowie for us with wine and fruit; there was a rather numerous com-
pany. He lives au quatrième and outside Berlin proper, in Charlottenburg,

first at Zurich, then at Vienna 257 and finally at Berlin. 262 I fought as hard as I 
could but it was no use, they must have me out. Well it will be the last time, I 
have informed them I will not go there again except under a written 
engagement that I shall be allowed to travel as a private individual. Anyhow 
they everywhere received me more than sp lendidly, far more so than I did, or 
had a right to, expect.

190 Letters- 1893 
As to the movement in Austria a nd Germany, it has exceeded my most 
extravagant expectations. Our French friends will have to bestir themselves 
if they will not be left behind. There is a power there, and both our men and 
their opponents know it. 
At Vienna I was at a meeting of some 6,000, and at the Konimers in Berlin 
they honoured me with, there were 4,000 present—only the representative 
men and women of the party—and I can assure you it was a pleasure to see 
and hear this people. When you come from England with this distracted and 
disunited working class we have here, when you have heard for years nothing 
but bickering and squabbles from France,  from Italy, from America, and then 
go amongst these people—the German-speaking ones—and see the unity of 
purpose, the splendid organisation, the enthusiasm, the unverwüstliche 
Humor, der aus der Siegesgewissheit quillt,’a you cannot help being carried away 
and saying: this is the centre of gravity of the working class movement. And if 
our French friends do not care, the Austrians may take the wind out of their 
sails. They are a mixed race—Germans grafted upon a Celtic (Noric) 263 stock 
and getting strongly mixed with a Slavonic element—thus combining the 
three chief European races in their blood.  Their temper is very much like the 
French—more lively and sanguine than the less mixed Germans, and more 
capable of initiative by impulse. Unless Paris minds its p s and q’s, Vienna may 
give the signal of the next revolution. I like the people very much, and the 
Viennese women remind me very much of the French working women of 40 
years ago; of course they are oversangui ne of success just like the French, but I 
think they are a deal clearer  headed than those Parisians who fell in love with 
Boulanger—must close—company arriving.

ENGELS TO JULIE BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 3 October 1893 
Dear Julie, 
You and August will have got our  postcard of Friday’s date. 264 I found a 
colossal pile of work waiting for me and, with the help of Louise who is still 
up to her eyes in printed matter, ha ve now toiled and moiled my way through 
what was the most urgent, and am thus able to drop you a couple of lines. 
Well, after our departure on Thursday. 189 we saw Adolf Braun for a mo-
ment at the Zoologischer Garten Stati on and then continued on our way. In 
our compartment there were two shabby looking johnnies who turned out to 
be something of a nuisance; luckily one of them, an Englishman, was 
completely drunk by ten o’clock, after which they spent the rest of the day in 
the corridor. 
In Hanover we had a meal consisting of soup and meat during the course 
of which we were joined by good old Kugelmann and his daughter 1, who is 
far nicer than he is. He again treated me to a whole catalogue of medical 
precepts for the governance of my life, but also to a little basket containing 
meat sandwiches, apples and half a bottle of wine. The sight of it sent us into 
transports—red wine! But alas, it was so-called ‘red port’, a sweetish 
concoction which we bestowed upon the ticket collector in return for his 
kindness. 
Soon after this there arose a lively debate between the ticket collector and 
some of the passengers on the question of whether those bound for the Hook 
of Holland ought not to change at Löhne and travel via Rheine-Salzbergen. 
We stuck firmly to Oberhausen, since Louise’s ticket did not leave us any 
other alternative. At Minden, however, the train was already half an hour late 
and, since we had only 17 minutes at Oberhausen in which to make the 
connection, there was every prospect that we should miss it. It was here that 
the time-table August had given me in the morning really came in handy. We 
took the old Cologne-Minden railway

which I knew to be one of the most soundly built in Germany. As we passed 
these stretches, we could see that we were making up for quite a bit of lost 
time, and in this way we arrived punctually at Oberhausen. 
The mining district between Hamm and Oberhausen is just like a piece of 
the English black country. The atmosphere and the towns just as smoky and 
black as in England, and the houses, b ecause mostly painted in light colour, 
even more unpleasantly blackened than the bare English brick. 
In Holland we again heard passengers and ticket collectors drop all kinds 
of dark hints about missed connecti ons, but nevertheless we arrived at 
Rotterdam at 8.42 Dutch, i.e. 9.42 German time. That hour’s difference had 
made everything all right (it hadn’t been quite clear to us from August’s 
time-table exactly where the change of time became operative and hence we 
had been in a state of uncertainty).  
And though in Rotterdam we had to walk from one station to the other—
about 10 minutes away—we still had so me time in hand and arrived there 
before those who had travelle d via Löhne-Rheine-Salzbergen. 
Aside from a little of Kugelmann’s fare, Louise had taken only one bowl 
of soup at Arnheim and another at Rotterdam, whereas I had subsisted on 
Kugelmann’s fare and beer. It was blowing quite nicely when we left. I soon 
turned in and was quite pleasantly rock ed to sleep, but didn’t suspect there 
was anything amiss until I woke up in br oad daylight after 8 hours, when we 
should long since have been in Harwich! I got up—I had the cabin all to 
myself—no one on board was stirring. I went up on deck to find it 
completely empty—everywhere wet decks and signs of its having been a 
rough night. At last a young German came along and confided to me that we 
had been through a frightful storm. Soon after, a few damsels appeared, and 
then Louise; the poor thing had been closeted in a small cabin with five 
others and had heroically survived the worst, despite her hysterical and sea-
sick entourage. Eventually, however, wh en the big rollers were succeeded by 
a choppy sea, she too momentarily su ccumbed to the importunities of old 
Neptune. 
We arrived two hours late in London—the Avelings were at the station—
found everything in excellent order and attacked our work with the 
recklessness customary in those who have heroically weathered a slight 
storm. Nothing much would seem to have happened here, and it is only by 
degrees that we shall be able to fi nd out about the little comings and goings 
of the local movement.

to circumstances, with Conservatives, 202 National Liberals, 203

article; at all events, the latter possibility is one he has also left open. 
But now, dear Julie, I must thank you and August once again for all the 
kindness and friendship you showed me, not only in Berlin but also in 
Zurich—and which August showed me throughout our trip; I can but remind 
you of your promise to pay us a visit here in the spring so that we for our part 
can show you London. Cordial regards to you both and to all our friends,

Dearest Julie,  
I really am more than up to my eyes in work  and as yet can see no way out of it, not even 
for writing letters. The Generalb who is settling down to his wr iting, has told you how we 
fared on the journey, but forgotten to say th at he monopolised the sandwiches you gave us. 
All went very well with him on the trip, he was always cheerful and in good spirits, always 
worried about missing our connections, and full of beans. On Sunday I myself at once fell 
back into my former, housekeeping role. But our guests treated me indulgently. Please tell 
August that I have not yet been able to find out anything definite about the second English 
edition; 265 I wish to see the book myself and shall get someone to buy it for me, but Reeves 
certainly wouldn’t sell it to me direct.  
I add my warmest thanks to those of the Ge neral. I have not had time to reflect upon all 
that I have experienced, and am living as if in  a dream, a dream interspersed with work. And 
you, poor tormented souls, how are you?  Love and kisses to you and August from

ENGELS TO HERMANN BLOCHER 
IN BASLE 
London, 3 October 1893  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
Dear Sir, 
Not until today, immediately afte r my return to this country, 189 have I 
been able to reply to your letter of 11 August. 266 
There are several copies of The Holy Family 1 in Berlin, while in 
Switzerland Dr Conrad Schmidt, lect urer at Zurich University, Klus-
Hegibachstrasse, Hirslanden, might be able to help you get hold of one. 
As regards Bruno Bauer’s career up till 1843, his fortunes and opinions, 
you might find some information in Ruge’s Hallische, subsequently 
Deutsche Jahrbücher; likewise in Bruno’s own writings. Also, in regard to 
the years 1844-46, in his works and his Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung. After 
1843 both Marx and I completely lost touch with the Bauers who didn’t 
come to London until some time toward s the end of the 50s— Edgar for a 
prolonged stay, Bruno for a visit, at which time Marx saw them again. 
However, so far as I know, Bruno never had anything to do with either the 
materialist view of history or scientific socialism, but if he ever had, this 
could only be discovered from Bruno’s la ter writings, those of the ‘50s and 
‘60s. It could hardly be denied that Marx’s views exerted a certain amount of 
influence upon Bruno’s subsequent works on early Christianity, but on the 
whole Bruno’s conception of historical causation remained primarily 
idealistic. 
It is my opinion that no one could successfully write a book about Bruno 
without spending a long time in Berlin where all the material has 
accumulated. 
Very sincerely yours,

Dear Sir, 
On my return from abroad 189 I find your letter of Aug. 10th. I am afraid I 
cannot be of any use to you in your dispute with your family. Even were your 
legal right to the money a good deal clearer to me than it is, I could only say 
that you, as a poor man, would hardly have the ghost of a chance, in English 
law courts, against wealthy people who moreover could fight you with your 
own money. But supposing you had the money to fight, my advice would 
still be: keep it rather than waste it on law. 
As to a lawyer such as you descri be and who would be willing to under-
take your lawsuit, you will not be ast onished if I tell you I do not know such 
a one. 
Regretting I cannot give you a more comforting reply 
I remain etc.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 184 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 7 October 1893 
Dear Sorge, 
We returned here on Friday 29 Sept ember and soon afterwards received 
your letter of the 22nd. I have been away for two months. 189 Louise Kautsky 
and I travelled to Cologne where we met Bebel and his wife and from there 
we all went on together via Mainz and Strasburg to Zurich, whence I slipped 
off for a week to Graubünden where I met one of my brothers.a But I had had 
to promise to be back for the end of the Congress on which occasion they 
induced me, malgré moi,b to join in the finale about which you w ill have 
read. 267 But that set the tone for the entire trip and completely put the lid on 
my intention of travelling purely as a private individual. I stayed another 
fortnight in Switzerland, after which Bebel and I travelled via Munich and 
Salzburg to Vienna. There the whole business of placing myself on display 
began all over again. First I had to attend a beano at which, however, there 
was room for only about 600, and the others also wanted to see me; so on the 
last evening there was another mass meeting at which I had to say a word or 
two. 257 Thence via Prague to Berlin where, having protested vehemently 
against a mass meeting they had planned, I got away with a beano at which 
3,000 or 4,000 people gathered. 262 The chaps meant all this very kindly, but 
it isn’t my cup of tea and I’m glad that it is over; next time I shall demand a 
written agreement to the effect that I shall not have to display myself before 
the public but shall be travelling as a private individual on private business. I 
was, and still am, astounded at the magni ficence of the reception I was given, 
but I would sooner leave such things to members of parliament and public 
speakers; for them it’s all part of the job, but has little to do with my kind of 
work. 
But in other respects, after 17 years of absence, 254 I found Germany 
completely revolutionised—industry enormously advanced as compared with 
before, agriculture—large- and small-scale— very much improved, 
a Hermann Engels senior — b willy-nilly  
=====第223页=====
Letters- 1893 197 
and hence our movement making capital progress. Such little freedom as our 
people possess, they have had to win for themselves—wresting it more 
especially from the police and the Landräte after the relevant laws had 
already been promulgated in writing. And hence you find an assured, 
confident demeanour such as has never been evinced by the German 
bourgeoisie. Needless to say, they ar e also open to criticism on a number of 
individual counts—for instance, the party press, notably in Berlin, is not 
abreast of the party—but the masses are fi rst-rate and better as a rule than the 
leaders, or at any rate than many w ho have come to occupy leading roles. 
With such chaps, nothing is impossible—they are really happy only in the 
midst of the struggle, they live for the struggle alone and are bored if their 
opponents do not provide them with work to do. It is an actual fact that 
another Anti-Socialist Law 15 would be greeted by most of them with 
sardonic laughter if not with positive gl ee—it would, after all, again give 
them something new to do each day! 
But alongside the Germans of Germany we should not forget the 
Austrians. By and large, they are not as  advanced as these Germans, but they 
are more vivacious, more French, more  easily carried away into performing 
great deeds, but also into perpetrating blunders. Seen individually, I prefer 
the average Austrian to the average German, the av erage Viennese working 
man to his fellow in Berlin and, so far as the women are concerned, I 
infinitely prefer the Viennese working woman; she possesses a naïve 
spontaneity beside which the studied precocity of her Berlin counterpart 
appears insufferable. If messieurs les Français don’t look out and make haste 
to resume their erstwhile tradition of revolutionary initiative, then it might 
happen that the Austrians will take the wind out of their sails and seize on the 
first opportunity to get things going. 
Incidentally, Berlin and Vienna, together with Paris, are now the most 
beautiful cities in the world, London and New York being filthy holes by 
comparison, especially London which has seemed quite strange to us since 
our return. 
In November messieurs les Français will have to show what they are ca-
pable of. 268 Twelve Marxists and four Blanquists, 20 five Allemanists 21 and 
two Broussists, 30 along with a few Independents and some twenty-four 
socialistes radicaux86 à la Millerand in the Chamber constitute a goodish 
lump of leaven and should produce a nice state of fermentation provided they 
stick together. But will they? The 12 Marxists are, by and large, completely 
unknown quantities; Lafargue is missing, while Guesde, who 
=====第224页=====
198 Letters- 1893 
is a member, is an infinitely more capable speaker but also an infinitely more 
gullible optimist. I am racked with curiosity. Even before the election our 
Marxists had already concluded a sort of pact with Millerand & Co. 169 which 
the Blanquists, and in particular Vailla nt, would appear to have associated 
themselves with by contributing to Millerand’s Petite République française. 
Again, the Blanquists are taking a very firm stand against the Russian 
alliance just now. But I have received no direct news about the present state 
of the various parties, probably becau se they are not yet clear about it 
themselves. 
I trust you and your wife are in good health. Cordial regards to you both

Dear Mr Sorge,  
May I pester you again by asking whether it would be possible for you to send me two 
copies of the Woman’s Journal, or do you think I should do better to order it direct on behalf 
of a woman friend of mine in Vienna? If so, what is the best way of paying the Americans 
and to whom do I address myself? But that’s  not all. Please could I have a three cent

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 
IN VIENNA 
London, 11 October 1893 
Dear Victor, 
We arrived back here on 29 September 189 with mounting recklessness, 
attacked the pile of work we found waiting for us. 
Though I was unable to discover Comrade Höger’s ‘whole series of 
boulevards’ in Berlin, there can be no doubt that, so far as appearances go, it 
is a very fine city; even in working- class districts all one sees are palatial 
façades. But what lies behind those façad es is better passed over in silence. 
The poverty of working-class districts is, of course, universal, but what I 
found particularly overwhelming was the ‘Berlin living-room’,a a place 
unimaginable anywhere else in the world, a refuge of darkness and stale air 
as also of your Berlin philistine who feels perfectly at home there. Golly! 
There was nothing of the kind in August’s apartment, which was the only one 
I liked, but in any of the others I’d go off my head. 
However in writing this letter it was not my object to send you the above 
cri de cœur, but rather to congratulate you and the Viennese. 
First, your Schwender speech 269 which shows once again how sure is your 
grasp of the difficult and complex conditions in Austria, and how firm a hold 
you keep on the clue in the labyrinth. And at this particular juncture that is of 
the utmost importance. 
In the second place I must especially  congratulate you and the Austrians 
generally on the resounding victory won as a result of your agitation for 
suffrage, namely Taaffe’s Electoral Reform Bill. 270 And here I must enlarge 
somewhat. 
Having taken a look at your country, people and government I have come 
to realise ever more clear ly that really outstanding victories are within our 
grasp there. An industry that is growi ng rapidly but which, because of years 
of high protective tariffs, still largely continues to operate 
a See this volume, p. 187  
=====第226页=====
200 Letters- 1893 
with outmoded productive forces (the equipment I saw in the Bohemian 
factories proved as much); the industrialists themselves. I mean the bigger 
ones—the majority of whom are as closely involved in the Stock Exchange 
as in industry proper; in the towns, philistines who are more or less indif-
ferent to politics, have abandoned themselves to sybaritism, 271 and desire 
above all to be left to pursue their pleas ures in peace; in the country, either a 
rapid slide into debt or the swallowing up of small properties; the real ruling 
classes are the big landowners who, however, are quite content with their 
political position whereby they are assured of a rather indirect domination; 
also the upper middle class and a scattering of haute financea closely linked 
with the big industrialists whose political power is much less immediately in 
evidence but who are also quite content with this state of affairs; among the 
propertied classes, i.e. the grandees, there is no desire to turn indirect into 
direct, constitutional rule, while among the small fry no serious effort is 
made toward true participation in political power; the result is indifference 
and stagnation, punctuat ed only by the feuding over nationalities between 
various members of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, and by the events 
arising out of the union with Hungary. 
Above all this there hovers a governme nt whose absolutist proclivities are 
subject to few formal, and these for the most part only fictive, restraints; nor, 
in practice, does it encounter many obstacles. For it is by its nature 
conservative and so, too, is your aristocrat, your bourgeois and your 
philistine bon vivant. The peasant, howev er, in his rural isolation, cannot 
achieve any organised opposition. What is  wanted of the government is that 
it should live and let live, and this is something at which the Austrian 
government has always been adept. Hence the fabrication—explicable also 
on other grounds—of laws and regulations  that exist only on paper, hence, 
too, the extremes to which that process is taken, its elevation into a principle 
and the astonishing administrative sli ppiness which, I must say, exceeded 
anything I could have imagined. 
Well then, in a stagnant political situation such as this, one in which the 
government, despite its extraordinarily  advantageous position vis-à-vis the 
individual classes, is nevertheless perpetually getting into hot water: 1. 
because those classes are split up in to umpteen nationalities and hence, 
contrary to all the rules of strategy, march united (against the workers) but 
fight divided (i.e., against one another), 2. because of 
a high financiers  
=====第227页=====
Letters- 1893 201 
perpetual money troubles, 3. because of  Hungary, 4. because of involvements 
abroad—in short in a situation like this, I told myself, a worker’s party with 
its own programme and tactics, which knows what it wants and how to get it, 
has sufficient will-power to do so, and is, moreover, thanks to a happy 
miscegenation of Celts, Slavs and Ge rmans, in which the latter element 
predominates, possessed of a gay, mercurial temperament—that party need 
only develop its capabilities enough to score quite outstanding successes. 
With none of the other parties knowing what they want and a government 
which likewise does not know what it wants, but lives from hand to mouth, a 
party which knows what it wants and wants it with tenacity and singleness of 
purpose, is bound to win in the end. And all the more so in that everything 
the Austrian Workers’ Party 272 wants and could want is no more than is also 
demanded by the country’s progr essive economic development. 
Here, therefore, we have a situation more propitious to rapid success than 
in any other country, even in Germany where, though development has been 
more rapid and the party is stronger, yet resistance is far more determined. 
Add to that the fact that Austria, a great power in decline, still feels ill at ease 
in Europe, a feeling that has always been  foreign to Prussia, a small power in 
the ascendant. And, having joined the ranks of the ‘modern’ states in 1866, 
Austria also feels ashamed of internal weaknesses —which it need not have 
done when still an avowedly reactionary  state. Indeed, the less a country 
wants to be a genuinely modern state, the greater will be its desire to be 
regarded as such, and the more strongl y reaction rears its head in Prussia—
where it is under far greater restraint th an in Austria—the more liberal will 
be the attitude adopted by Au stria out of malicious glee. 
Now, the situation in Europe—I mean the internal situation of the in-
dividual states—is approximating ever more closely to that of 1845. The 
proletariat is increasingly coming to hold the same position as the bour-
geoisie did then. At that time it was Switzerland and Italy who set things off; 
Switzerland with her internal strife between democratic and Catholic cantons 
which came to a head in the Sonderbund War; 273 Italy with Pio Nono’s 274 
liberal endeavours and the liberal-nationalist changes in Tuscany, the small 
duchies, Piedmont, Naples and Sicily. The Sonderbund War and the 
bombardment of Palermo 275 were, as everyone knows, the immediate 
precursors of the February revolution of 1848 in Paris. 
Today, when the crisis might come to a head only five or six years hence, 
Belgium would seem to be taking over the role of Switzerland, 
=====第228页=====
202 Letters- 1893 
Austria that of Italy, and Germany that of France. The struggle for suffrage 
began in Belgium 276 and is being taken up on an impressive scale in Austria. 
And there can be no question of a settle ment being reached on the basis of 
some sort of half-baked electoral reform. Once the ball is rolling, the 
impulsion will communicate itself to all around it, and thus one country will 
immediately affect its neighbour, So be sides the possibility of your scoring 
great victories there is the opportunity, i.e. hence also the likelihood, of your 
doing so. 
Such, more or less, is the tenor of what I expounded to Louise yesterday 
afternoon as my view of Austria’s immediate mission. And at 8 p.m. the 
Evening Standard brought the news—still in rather indefinite terms—of 
Taaffe’s capitulation,a while today we are given the Bill, at any rate in very 
general outline. Well, now the ball really has got rolling, and you people will 
see to it that it doesn’t stop. I don’t wa nt to say anything about the Bill until I 
am rather better informed, but of one th ing I feel sure, namely that Taaffe 
would like, à la Bismarck, to split the now undi vided urban Liberal vote and 
play off the workers against the bourgeoisie. Not that we have any objection; 
the Liberal and other bourgeois parties will try and restrict enfranchisement 
still further, and you might thus find yourselves in the pleasant position of 
supporting the worthy Taaffe against his parliament. At all events, it’s a 
bonus that is not to be sneezed at and,  before I come back, you will doubtless 
be duly installed as a deputy in the Diet. The Daily Chronicle ’is already 
talking of 20 safe seats for Labour. With 20, or even less than 20, the Diet 
will be a very different kind of body from what it has been hitherto, and the 
gentlemen will be amazed at the life that this will inject in to the ramshackle 
old place. And if a few Czechs should ha ppen to get in alongside our German 
chaps, it will put something of a damper on the squabbling over nationalities, 
and enable Young Czechs and Old Czechs 277 and German Nationals to see 
each other in an altogether new light. And here one might say that the entry 
of the first social-Democrats into the Diet, will mark the beginning of a new 
era in Austria. 
And it is you people who have brought this about and, because of the 
dawning of this new era, we all of us rejoice that we shall have in the Diet a 
man with so incisive an intellect as yourself.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 12 October 1893 
Dear August, 
We are sending you Reeves’s edition of Woman. 265 In my view the legal 
position (upon which the whole thing turns when you’re dealing with a chap 
like Reeves) is as follows: 
1. So far as the translator is concerned, international copyright provides 
protection for three years from the publication of the original, but only if 
during the  first year the  first part of a translation authorised by the author 
has actually appeared in print. Accordingly you would have absolutely no 
claim unless Walther’sa translation had appeared within one year of the 
publication of a new German edition containing substantial alterations and 
additions not contained in the earlier one; this was hardly the case. 
2. There remains Mrs Adams Walthe r’s claim. Whether she has any 
depends on whether, upon th e publication of the first English edition, she 
reserved the Copyright or whether she expressly or tacitly assigned it to the 
publishers, the Modern Press. This should be ascertained. If she did not 
expressly reserve it then, legislation over here being what it is, it is ten 
a Adams Walther  
=====第230页=====
204 Letters- 1893 
to one that it was tacitly assigned to the publisher and that consequently she 
too no longer has any claim. 
3. So far as I know, the latter, one Foulger, had long since had to wind up 
his business and was no doubt glad to come to any sort of agreement with 
Reeves. 
Accordingly it is almost certain that you cannot do anything in the legal 
line, nor is it at all likely that Mrs Adams Walther can do anything either, but 
this should be ascertained. If you could procure me a copy of the agreement 
between Mrs Walther and the Modern Press I could, if necessary, consult a 
lawyer. But unless everything is absolutely cut-and-dried there’s nothing to 
be done with a laddie like Reeves; in his speculative enterprises he is as 
unscrupulous as they come, and getti ng money out of him is a virtual 
impossibility; I, too, have unfortunately had dealings with him, and not even 
the threat of a lawsuit is of  any real avail. In cases such as these, laddies of 
his stamp generally make over everything to their wives or concoct a BILL OF 
SALE (assigning their stock, etc., to a fictitious or genuine creditor). 
Yesterday we got two splendid bits of news. 
First, the beginning of the end of the pit strike. After the lock-out of the 
workers, engineered by the big colliery owners on 28 July: 1. in order to raise 
prices and curtail production, 2. so that ruinous contracts, carelessly entered 
into, for a year’s supply of coal to gasworks and other municipal 
undertakings could be broken with impunity because, in all such contracts, 
strikes provide indemnity against breach of contract, 3. to depress wages and 
4. to ruin the small mining companies and buy them up at knock-down 
prices—this is coming increasingly to be the permanent motive behind all big 
LOCK -OUTS —well then, after the said lock-out had been going on for over 
two months and public opinion among the middle classes, who had been hit 
by the coal shortage, had also begun to turn—against the mine owners, things 
came to a head. During the first week  of October the agreement expired 
whereby the mine owners had undertaken, on pain of a £1,000 fine, to re-
open their pits, but only if wages were reduced by a full 25 per cent (of the 
former wage plus the 40 per cent increase gained after 1889, i.e. at the 1889 
wage plus 15 per cent), and on condition of the strike’s being called off by 
the miners’ committee. A number of the smaller collieries immediately 
defected and resumed work at the pre-]uly wage (i.e. at the 1889 wage, plus 
the 40 per cent increase). The mayors of  the larger towns in the Yorkshire 
and Midlands mining districts then 
=====第231页=====
Letters- 1893 205 
foregathered and proposed a settlement which, in fact, boiled down to a 10 
per cent reduction in wages. Had the ma sters accepted, this could have been 
dangerous as it might have placed the workers on the horns of a dilemma—
either they, too, accepted or they risk ed turning against themselves a public 
opinion that is always fickle and ready to applaud any kind of compromise. 
But luckily the MASTERS —the big ones in the lead—were deluded enough to 
refuse forthwith, and within twenty-four hours the collapse of their ring was 
manifest to all. As from yesterday some  thirty or forty thousand miners have 
returned to work at the pre-July wage, which means that the masters have 
totally renounced their demands and the hash of the colliery-owners’ ring has 
been well and truly settled. This is the first instance in which a big strike, set 
on foot by the masters themselves at a time of their own choosing, has gone 
so completely awry, and therein lies its significance. It will be some time 
before they try the same thing agai n, but the workers have themselves 
suffered so much and endured such poverty that they, too, are unlikely to 
have much stomach left for a ‘general strike’. 
(Have just got yours and Julie’s letter.) 
The second piece of news was about th e new Austrian Electoral Reform 
Bill. 270 It is a resounding victory for our people and I hastened to 
congratulate Victor upon it.a The Daily News thinks that the number of voters 
in Vienna will rise from 80,000 to 350,000, while the Chronicle estimates the 
number for Austria as a whole at three million—these estimates come, of 
course, from Viennese sources. At all events it’s a bonus that is not to be 
sneezed at. The bourgeois in Vienna are already thinking in terms of twenty 
Social Democrat deputies. 
It’s more than probable that Taaffe is counting on his Bill being changed 
for the worse by Parliament, but it’s a long shot and our chaps will see that 
he doesn’t get away with it. What a delicious quirk of history if it should so 
turn out that our chaps have to protect the Prime Minister against his 
Parliament and against his own secret self! The main thing is that the ball has 
at last started rolling and in Austria our movement is powerful enough to 
prevent its being brought to a halt. And Taaffe cannot very well suppress 
demonstrations in support of his Bill. 
From my general impression of Austria,  I should say that that country will 
give us much cause for rejoicing in  the immediate future. What with 
a See previous letter.

the general prostration of all the par ties, the general perplexity, the feuding 
over nationalities, what with a governme nt that never knows what it wants 
and lives only from hand to mouth, what with laws that exist for the most 
part only on paper and the general sloppiness of the administration—of 
which I have, from my own observati on, only recently got any real idea—
what with all these things, a party which knows what it wants and how to get 
it, which genuinely wants it and is po ssessed of the required tenacity, is 
bound in the long run to prove invincible especially when, as in this instance, 
all its demands follow the same trend as the economic development of the 
country as such and are no more th an the political expression of that 
development. Our party in Austria 272 is the only living force in the field of 
politics; otherwise there is nothing but passive resistance or new ventures 
that never come to anything, and this places us in an exceptionally 
favourable position in Austria. Furtherm ore, the changes that occur in the 
grouping of the bourgeois parties sometimes make it impossible for the 
government to be Conservative and, wh en it ceases to be Conservative, it 
simply becomes unpredictable, if only by reason of the fact that the party 
groupings of which it has to take acc ount are likewise unpredictable. And 
again, the Austrian government is that of a great power which, though in 
decline, is nevertheless still a great power and, as compared with Prussia, a 
small power in the ascendant, is still capable of remarkable initiatives at such 
times as conservatism, sheer clinging to the status quo, ceases to be possible. 
That is my explanation for Mr Taaffe’s ‘leap in the dark’. 
Another fact to be considered is that the growth of the proletarian 
movement in all countries is about to precipitate a crisis and that in conse-
quence any successes one country may achieve will react powerfully upon 
all the others. The suffrage movement  won its first victory in Belgium 276 and 
now Austria is about to follow suit. At the outset this will ensure the survival 
of universal suffrage, but also encourage us to make further demands—in 
Germany no less than in France and Italy. The way was paved for the 
February Revolutiona by Switzerland’s internal struggles and the 
constitutional upheavals in Italy. Again, the Sonderbund War 273 and the 
bombardment of Messinab by the Neapolitans 275 (Feb. 1848) were the 
immediate signal for the outbreak of revolution in Paris. Maybe the crisis 
will not be upon us for some five or si x years yet, but I should say that the

preparatory role will this time fall to Belgium and, in particular, Austria, 
while the dénouement will take place in Germany. 
There is no fear that th e cause will ever again be dropped in Austria; our 
people in that country will see to that. Th e Austrian Diet is an infinitely more 
stagnant froggery than the German Reichstag or even the Saxon or the 
Bavarian Chamber. The presence of a dozen Socialist deputies will have a far 
more galvanic effect ther e than it would in our case,  and we are exceptionally 
lucky in having in Victor a chap w ho has so clear a conception of the 
complexities of conditions in Austria a nd is able to subject them to so 
incisive an analysis. His speech in the last Arbeiter-Zeitung is a real tour de 
force.a 
Ede and Gina were here this morning. He isn’t yet at all as he should be, 
has a mania for splitting hairs and increas ingly recalls the sagacity of his 
Volks-Zeitung uncle; I often get the impression that old Aaronb in person is 
standing before me. It was he who spoilt things for himself in Switzerland. 
Having been told in Berne that one of them but not both at once would be 
admitted, he should have realised that  the best policy would be to give 
precedence to Julius, as an invalid and,  banking on this, to return six months 
later, when they could hardly refuse him admittance, at least for any length of 
time. But this his impatience would not brook. The best of it is that he now 
sometimes avers he would prefer to stay here and that it’s Gina who wants to 
go to Switzerland. His dream is, as it always will be, to go back to Berlin. He 
really imagines this to be possible and is always consulting lawyers about it. 
Remains to be seen! 
If Schlüter has any sense he will do himself and his wi fe the kindness of 
starting divorce proceedings. A su it of this kind against an absent wife for 
deliberate desertion has few disadvantages  for either party, and after all he 
too must wish for complete freedom. This is not, of course, to say that he 
hasn’t in any case been accustomed to  enjoying that freedom whenever op-
portunity arose. It is always satisfactor y, by the way, to hear that a woman 
one knows is plucking up the courage to make herself independent. The 
decision to part from her Hermann for good may have cost her many a 
mental struggle and she may thus at one time have given the impression of 
being by nature irresolute. What an expenditure of energy bourgeois marriage 
demands—first until one has got to that  stage, then for so long as the 
nonsense lasts and then until one is finally done with it.

We have just come back from a wa lk in the park—glorious autumn 
weather, a pretty sunset in a cloudless sky and beautifully coloured foliage. 
Downstairs the table is being laid; we are having Welsh mutton dressed as 
venison, accompanied by good old noodles. So I must  hurry up and finish 
this. Louise and I thank Julie for her kind letters and are saving up our 
answers for next time. Warm regards from us both to both of you, likewise to 
Singer and his sister, to the Liebknechts and all our dear friends whose names 
I cannot list if the joint is not to grow cold.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 13 October 1893 
My dear Lafargue, 
Is the Paris letter in today’s Vorwärts from you? This is why I am asking. 
When I was in Berlin, 189 Liebknecht said he was arranging to take you on 
as correspondent for Vorwärts, but that the money had still to be voted by the 
Party Committee; in the meantime he asked me to tell you that it was a 
matter of regular work, of letters to be se nt at stated intervals, once a week or 
a fortnight, for example, something which so far he had not been able to get 
from his French correspondents. I promised I would write to you about it as 
soon as he let me know that the matter had been clinched between you two. 
I used the opportunity to reproach him for setting such store by any

anti-Russian article of Vaillant’s,a which he always faithfully reprints, 
whereas far more robust anti-Russian articles, published by Le Socialiste over 
a long period, have been passed over almost unnoticed by him. He 
apologised and promised to do better. 
But he has not written a word about the matter of your correspondence, 
and he goes on translating and making much of Blanquist statements, even 
translating the Chauviere.b 
He has, moreover, reprinted an article by young Arndt,c although this chap 
voted all the time with Argyriadès & Co. against the Germans at Zurich. 250 
And Arndt is on the Blanquist re volutionary Central Committee. 
So as you see Liebknecht leans very strongly towards the Blanquists. I’m 
not looking for reasons, I simply state the fact. Hence it is important that you 
should do everything, in despite of hi m, to maintain the position you have 
always held in relation to the German party: that of its main allies in France, 
who have first claim to be taken into consideration in relations between the 
German party and the French Socialists in general. And, to this end, you 
must be represented on Vorwärts, so that the Paris correspondence should be, 
at least to some extent, in your hands. 
Of course the decision does not rest solely with the editorial board. The 
Executive Committee has something to say. And I am convinced that you 
will find support there, if it is needed. It goes without saying that I shall do 
my utmost to ensure the continuation of a close alliance between the German 
party and your party in France (which will not commit you to taking their 
money, that can always go to the Blanquists, if you don’t want any more of 
it, 278 as you say; they will be delighted to take it). So let me know how far 
you have got with Liebknecht concerning your appointment as regular 
Vorwärts correspondent; and without delay, fo r, if there are difficulties, I 
must be able to take steps before the Cologne Congress on the 22nd of the 
month. 279 
Going by Le Socialiste, I counted on our having twelve deputies. It is true 
that, knowing no more than half of them even by name, I had my doubts 
about their reliability. But, according to your letter, you do not seem to know 
so far as half of them are concerned whether they are our people or not. Very 
unfortunate. With 12 sound chaps, led by Guesde, we

should soon have been able to compel the Blanquists, 20 Allemanists, 21 etc. 
to fall in with us. But if we can look to only half-a-dozen reliable people, we 
shall have to treat with these gentlemen on a more or less equal footing, in 
which case the old divisions may continue, or else, if there is unity, it will be 
achieved at the price of sacrifi ces in matters of principle. 
Certainly Vaillant seems very much more sensible since his election than 
he was six months ago, but will he always be sure of a majority on his 
Central Committee? Or else, to make sure of it, may he not have to sacrifice 
his personal opinion on matters of substance to the prejudices of those silly 
conspirators? 
It is sad that you were beaten at Lille. 252 You sacrificed yourself for the 
party: instead of nursi ng your constituents by assiduous parliamentary 
activity, you travelled about and collected votes for others. But the fact 
remains we need you in the Chamber too; and I hope you will get the first 
vacant seat. 
The new paper will not—like the last one—be advertised ‘to appear in 
October’, I hope? 280 Will not La Petite République Française bar the way? 
This is another outcome of the Millerand-Goblet alliance; 169 you gave them 
far more help than they gave you in return. It’s one thing for Millerand, but 
Goblet! an ex-Minister and candidate for the premiership! 
Tomorrow I shall write a few words to Laura on business —I cannot 
manage it today, I have been interrupted all the afternoon and it is now past 5 
o’clock. In the meantime, kiss her for me. 
Greetings from Louise. 
Ever yours,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 14 October 1893 
My dear Löhr, 
I have received 3 copies of the French Origine de la famille etc. To my 
surprise the words ‘ entièrement revue par M-me Laura Lafargue’’a which 
were on the proof of the title, do not appear there now. Is this, as I suppose, a 
little treachery of Rave? If so I shall protest. 
Voilà Fortin of Beauvais who informs me that he intends translating. 
1. The Kritik der Hegclsehen Rechtsphilosophie in the Deutsch- 
Französische Jahrbücher (by Mohr, 1844) and 
2. the 3 Chapters Gewaltstheorièb of my Anti-Dühring.  
I have absolutely no time to revise his work—and No. 1 is immensely 
difficult. And rather than revise Fortin’s work (which you know from 
experience) maybe you’d rather do the whole thing yourself. The first— 
Mohrs epigrammatic style—I consider him uncommonly unfit to render. 
Nobody but you could do that. 
He intends publishing them in the Ere Nouvelle.  
What do you think I had better say to him? 
Glorious victory in Austria. Taaffe proposes an electoral law 270 which is 
tantamount to universal suffrage at least in towns and industrial districts—so 
says Adler. Taaffe’s policy is to break the power of the German Liberal Party 
(representing the German and Jewish bourgeoisie) and probably, too, to let as 
many Socialists replace Liberal Bourgeoi s as may be necessary to drive the 
other parties to a closer union and thus to give to him a working majority. 
The Lower House in Austria is composed  of 85 representatives of the large 
landed proprietors, 21 of the Chamber of Commerce (these 106 are not 
affected by the new bill), 97 of the towns and 150 of the country districts 
(both of these will be elected  according to the new bill). 
For the present the country district s will send about the same Catholic

and Conservative members as hitherto, and the exclusion of analphabètes 
will here considerably restrict the suffra ge; but in the industrial centres of the 
West and North (Vorarlberg, Austria proper, Bohemia, Moravia, perhaps 
Steiermark) the new bill will practically establish a very near approach to 
universal suffrage. It is calculated by bourgeois papers that the number of 
voters will be 5,200,000 instead of 1,770,000, and the number of socialist 
seats are estimated at from 20 to 60! Give us 20 to 24 (this is the number of 
signatures required for a motion to be discussed) and we shall upset the 
whole of this old-fashioned assembly. It is a complete revolution, our people 
in Vienna are jubilant, although’, of course they insist upon full universal 
suffrage, direct elections , and abolition of the 106 privileged members. 
Kind regards from Louise.

warded to appreciative friends. The book, I am glad to see, has caused 
considerable stir and indeed sensation, as it well merited. Among the 
Russians I have met, it was the chief subject of conversation. Only yesterday 
one of thema writes: 
‘we in Russia are arguing over the ‘fate of capitalism here’.b 
In the Berlin Sozialpolitische Centralblatt 1 a Mr. P. v. Struve has a long 
article on your book.c I must agree with him in this one point, that for me, 
too, the present capitalistic phase of development in Russia appears an 
unavoidable consequence of the historical conditions as created by the 
Crimean War, the way in which the ch ange of 1861 in agrarian conditions 
was accomplished, and the political sta gnation in Europe generally. Where 
he is decidedly wrong, is in comparing the present state of Russia with that of 
the United States, in order to refute what he calls your pessimistic views of 
the future. He says, the evil consequences of modern capitalism in Russia 
will be as easily overcome as they are in the United States. There he quite 
forgets that the United States are modern, bourgeois, from the very origin; 
that they were founded by petits bourge ois and peasants who ran away from 
European feudalism in order to establish a purely bourgeois society. Whereas 
in Russia, we have a groundwork of a primitive communistic character, a 
pre-civilisation Gentilgesellsehaft,d crumbling to ruins, it is true, but still 
serving as the groundwork, the material upon which the capitalistic 
revolution (for it is a real social revolution) acts and operates. In America, 
Geldwirthschaff has been fully established for more than a century, in Russia, 
Naturalwirtschaft was all but exclusively the rule . Therefore it stands to 
reason that the change, in Russia, must be  far more violent, far more incisive, 
and accompanied by immensely greater su fferings than it can be in America. 
But for all that it still seems to me that you take a gloomier view of the 
case than the facts justify. No doubt , the passage from primitive agrarian 
communism to capitalistic industrialis m cannot take place without terrible 
dislocation of society, without the disappearance of whole classes and their 
transformation into other classes; and what enormous suffering, and waste of 
human lives and productive forces  that necessarily implies,

we have seen—on a smaller scale—in Western Europe. But from that to the 
complete ruin of a great and highly I gifted nation there is still a long way. 
The rapid increase of population to wh ich you have been accustomed, may 
be checked; the reckless deforestation combined with the expropriation of 
the old landlordsa as well as the peasants, ma y cause a colossal waste of 
productive forces; but after all, a popul ation of more than a hundred million 
will finally furnish a very considerable home market for a very respectable 
grande industrie, and with you, as elsewhere, things will end by finding their 
own level—if capitalism lasts long enough in Western Europe. 
You yourself admit that 
‘the social conditions in Russia after th e Crimean War were not favorable to the 
development of the form of production inhe rited by us from our past history’.  
I would go further, and say, that no more in Russia than anywhere else 
would it have been possible to develop a higher social form out of primitive 
agrarian communism unless that higher form was already in existence in 
another country, so as to serve as a model. That higher form being,  wherever  
it is historically  possible,  the necessary  consequence  of the capitalistic form 
of production and of the social dualistic antagonism created by it, it could not 
be developed directly out of the agrarian commune, unless in imitation of an 
example already in existe nce somewhere else. Had the West of Europe been 
ripe, 1860-70, for such a transformation, had that transformation then been 
taken in hand in England, France etc., then the Russians would have been 
called upon to show what could have been made out of their Commune, 
which was then more or less intact. But the West remained stagnant, no such 
transformation was attempted, and capitalism was more and more rapidly 
developed. And as Russia had no choice but this: either to develop the 
Commune into a form of Production, from which it was separated by a 
number of historical stages, and for which not even in the West the 
conditions were then ripe—evidently an  impossible task—or else to develop 
into Capitalism, what remained to her but the latter chance? 
As to the Commune, it is only possible so long as the differences of wealth 
among its members are but trifling. As soon as these differences become 
great, as soon as some of its members become the debt-slaves of the richer 
members, it can no longer live. The bi g peasants and village exploiters’ 3

of Athens, before Solon, have destroyed the Athenian gens with the same 
implacability with which those of your  country destroy the Commune. I am 
afraid that institution is doomed. But on the other hand, Capitalism opens out 
new views and new hopes. Look at what it has done and is doing in the West. 
A great nation like yours outlives every crisis. There is no great historical 
evil without a compensating historical progress. Only the modus operandi is 
changed. Que les destinées s’accomplissent!a

capital handle to work in connection with getting publishers, and paying ones, for 
your other translations. You have no bus iness to be ashamed of your own good 
work, or to allow Rave to adorn himself with other bird’s feathers. There is no 
reason whatever for you to ‘keep in the background’. And this kind of work 
nowadays ought to bring in money to you—surely Rave is paid, and paid 
handsomely for his bad work which has to  be licked into decent shape by you—
and I do not see why you should not reap where you have sown.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN COLOGNE 
London, 18 October 1393 
 
Dear August, 
I have just received notifica tion from the publishers of the Vorwärts, etc., 
that they ‘plan’ to re-issue the Anti-Dühring and that all they require of me is 
to append a few brief remarks to the new edition. What I myself might 
perhaps ‘plan’ no one bothered to ask. 
Now you will recall that during our trip 189 we agreed to give the Anti-
Dühring to Dietz and, in lieu thereof, the shorter, more popular stuff to the 
Vorwärts. I shall therefore provisionally acquaint the gentlemen in Berlin of 
that fact, lest they should delude themselves further. I am sending this 
straight to Cologne, as I understand from Louise th at you will be going from 
there to Stuttgart and will thus be able to discuss the matter with Dietz. The 
following are my terms for an edition of  a size he can determine himself but 
of which he must also notify me: 
1. A fee of 15% of the retail price, i.e. 15 Pfg. per mark. That is what we 
get here in England for translations of my stuff. Since the book does not, 
after all, lend itself to bulk sales except in a limited degree, he can fix the 
price accordingly. 
2. The fee to be paid to Dr Victor Adler of Vienna. 282 
3. Dietz to undertake not to reduce the price either of the whole or of part 
without my written consent. This is to prevent the book from being used, as 
has happened before, to help shift certain slow-moving stock. 
That is all. 
As you know, Liebknecht (on that Sunday in Grunewald) tackled me with 
a view to my reminding Lafargue a bout regular work as a correspondent. 
This I promised to do as soon as he let me know that the Executive had 
approved Lafargue’s fee. A report of the Paris Marxist Congress 283 from a 
Paris correspondent then appeared in the Vorwärts. I inquired of Lafarguea 
(having heard nothing from Liebknecht) whether it was by 
a See this volume, pp. 208-09  
=====第244页=====
218 Letters- 1893 
him, to which he replied in the negative. Whereupon I asked Liebknecht 25 
how the matter stood and have now received the following answer: 
‘Before leaving for Saxony, whence I have just  returned, I wrote to August asking him to 
settle the matter with Lafargue. I am depende nt on the Executive in all questions involving 
extraordinary expenditure.’  
So it seems that you are once again to be held responsible for the 
omissions of others. Now admittedly the Executive has of late been ab-
solutely overwhelmed with work, but I would venture to point out that the 
engagement of a newspape r correspondent could be attended to in a matter of 
minutes. It almost seems to me as though Liebknecht, with his growing 
predilection for Vaillant, had no particular desire to fix things up with 
Lafargue, otherwise he would no doubt have settled the matter before the 
Paris Congress and in that case would also have received the authentic report 
of it (the French did not admit reporters or members of the public). 
Over here all is bustle. The day be fore yesterday we had Lehmann and 
Mrs Adams Walther and today we have Shmuilov, who proposes to marry 
here. I asked Mrs. Adams Walther about  her arrangements with Foulger. She 
knew nothing definite, but will make i nquiries from the friend who saw to 
the matter and will let me know the result.  From what she was able to say, it 
seems highly probable that the copyright has been tacitly assigned to 
Foulger, and in that case absolutely no action whatever can be taken against 
Reeves other than by inserting an announcement in the papers to the effect 
that the said text has long been out of date. 265 
I intended to send you the 20 marks I borrowed on the last day but have 
not got round to going into town and collecting German notes. You shall 
have it next time. Should there be a further amount owing to you, as is quite 
possible, perhaps you would remind me in your next. 
Tussy has got Lassalle’s letters and will copy them out on her typewriter. 
284 She will charge you the usual rate and I shall pay her. But what are you 
giving the heirs in the way of a fee? The handwriting is such that I still can’t 
tell how much it will be. 
21 Oct. Yesterday this letter was laid aside yet again, as I had to take 
Shmuilov to the registry office and help him deal with the preliminary 
formalities, he being unfamiliar with English and I being unable to find 
anyone else. It will be a month before the actual joining together in mat-
rimony can take place. 
In Austria the cause is doing splendidly. The general disorientation of 
=====第245页=====

the parties, the Emperor’sa vacillation and the virtual certainty of a dis-
solution and new elections will provi de occasion for the most splendid 
agitation on the part of our chaps and for creating a thorough commotion in 
the old morass. The various aristocra tic and bourgeois parties are scuttling 
about in all directions like ants in the ruins of an antheap. The old order, 
shaky as it was, has now gone for good and all we have to do is see to it that 
things don’t calm down again. And that won’t be difficult. 
Obviously there will be repercussions in Germany. Just as in 1848 when 
Vienna kicked off on 13 March, thereby compelling Berlin to follow suit on 
the 18th. Brussels 276 Vienna 270—Berlin—is now the natural ‘alphabetical 
order’. Prussian and other forms of  local suffrage, the Constitution of 
Hamburg, etc., will doubtless each in turn  have to swallow it. The period of 
stagnation and reaction in the legislative field that began in 1870 is over. 
Governments are again coming under the control of a living political 
movement among the people and it is we who are at the back of that 
movement, it is we who determine it, now negatively, now positively. We are 
now what the Liberals were before 1848, and our victories in the Belgian and 
Austrian elections have shown that the ferment we provide is strong enough 
to complete the process of fermenta tion now begun. But the process will be 
neither smooth nor rapid until we have also won direct or indirect victories in 
Germany—conquests in the libertarian se nse, greater political power for the 
working man, the extension of his freedom of movement. And that too will 
come. 
If you make use of the passages from Miquel’s letters, don’t expend all 
your powder at one go. Remember that hardly have the things come out than 
the effect is lost and cannot be repeat ed—unless, that is, we still have some 
ammunition in reserve. 
There was a very real risk of a general strike in Austria and one cannot yet 
rule out the possibility of its being set in train for the benefit of Taaffe’s 
ministry and his electoral reforms, 270 which would certainly be the height of 
historical irony. When the English miners were locked out,b it was clear how 
bemusing such a muddle-headed notion could be. The basic idea is to force 
the hand of the bourgeoisie by means of a general shortage of coal. This has 
its points if the workers take the offensive, i.e. do so when business is good. 
When business is depressed, on the other hand, industrialists find themselves 
with excessive stocks and collieries 
Francis Joseph I — b See this volume, p. 204

220 Letters- 1893 
with more coal than they can sell. It is then that the capitalists seize the 
initiative, the aim being to cut down pr oduction by means of lock-outs, and 
to depress wages at the same time—in such a case a general strike is grist to 
the capitalists’ mill, since it is in their interest that the production of coal be 
curtailed. What the English ought to ha ve done was to advise the Continental 
miners not to strike on any account, so that if possible coal might be brought 
from the Continent to England. But everywhere people’s heads were turned 
by the catchword ‘general strike’, the lockout in England was followed by 
the Belgian and French strikes 285 and such effect as these had in England 
could only have been of benefit to the capitalists. 
Whereas the big colliery owners are still putting up a fight, more and more 
of the smaller ones are knuckling under. Some 80,000 men are back at work 
but about 200,000 are still out. The big one s are threatening the workers with 
the ultimate sanction, namely eviction from colliery-owned dwellings. If 
there were strike breakers ready and willing to move into these houses, the 
collieries would unquestionably see to  it that this was done and would 
receive military aid to that end. Such , however, is not the case, and for the 
sake of a purely arbitrary act, the sole purpose of which would be to deposit 
the workers without shelter outside houses that would remain empty, the 
government will be unlikely to expose itself once again to the unpopularity it 
would attract as a result of a fus illade, as recently at Featherstone. 286 If it 
happens nevertheless, much blood will be  spilt. This is an ultimate sanction 
the workers won’t submit to. 
The Avelings will be coming shortly , having just announced themselves 
for a meal. This house is like a dovecote. So good-bye and my regards to 
everyone, including Dietz and K. Kautsky and wifea when you get to 
Stuttgart. 
Yours,  
F.E.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 27 October 1893  
My dear Löhr, 
Though Fortin is a business-man, yet with the help of a Roumanian (with 
business habits partly of a Polish Jew, partly of a spendthrift boyar) he 
succeeds in creating a very fair muddle. 
I wrote to Fortin 25 that you did not know the Kritik der Rechtsphilosophiea 
but if he thought proper, he might send you his copy of the Deutsch-
Französische Jahrbücher so that you might read it a nd form an idea as to the 
advisability—both an to contents and to form—of its being submitted to the 
French working people. Diamandy, in his eagerness to get stuff for his 
review,b rushes at you and transforms, moreover, the one article into 
plusieursc (business principles of the Polish Jew, to ask much so as to be able 
to rebate) as for instance: 
— Was kostet die Elle von dem Stoff?  
— Fünfzehn Groschen.  
— Fünfzehn sagt er, zwölfeinenhalben meint er, zehn wird er nehmen, 
sieben und einen halben ist die Sache werth, fünf macht ich ihm geben, werd’ 
ich ihm bieten zwei und einen halben Groschen!d 
Voilà ce que c’est.e Let Fortin first send you his copy and then you will 
see what you will see. 
As to the Gewalttheorief not a line in Fortin’s letter led me to conclude 
that the thing had been already done and I don’t believe it either. To make 
you believe that you are en face d’un fait accompli, is another of these 
Oriental tricks which they consider perfectly justifiable in the service of the

cause. You will never arrive at the facts, much less at any practical conclu-
sion, until you have eliminated Diamandy and deal direct with Fortin. 
Diamandy served me exactly the same with regard to the translation of the 
Ursprung for the Ère Nouvelle.  
I had a few lines from Bebel to-day about Paul’s affair.b The delay was 
caused by 1. the Saxon elections; 2. the Cologne Congress 279 which 
prevented full meetings of the Executives, and overwhelmed them with 
business. As soon as both Bebel and Liebknecht shall have returned to 
Berlins, the matter will be settled. But Be bel says at the same time, there is a 
great distrust of Paris correspondents of French nationality, as hitherto 
everyone of them has ceased to write  reports at the very moment when 
French affairs became highly interesti ng—they then looked after their own 
business and left the Vorwärts to shift for themselves. I shall do my best to 
persuade them that now Paul has no longer a free pass an the railways, this 
will cease as far as he is concerned, but I do hope that our Paris friends will 
at last learn to treat business as business and engagements as things to be 
fulfilled—at least as a rule.  
Kind regards from Louise.

‘silence’, it evidently implies the threat that you might now break that 
silence. In which case you have met your match. If it really is your intention 
to threaten me, I have only one answer and that is: ‘do your worst’. I don’t

But what I cannot understand at all in how you came to write me such an

I can find me explanation for it other than the state of nervous tension you

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 3 November 1893  
 
Dear Baron, 
1. Howell. His book Conflicts, etc., is a fat compendium of 536 pages and 
would in my opinion find few buyers in Germany, especially since all the 
earlier history and some of the later stuff is cribbed from Brentano.b Howell’s 
Trades Unionism New and Old, 235 pp., is a shorter excerpt which appeared 
it 1891 and is also a year more up to date in regard to facts. If it was checked, 
provided with notes and translated in abbreviated form, it might possibly find 
buyers. 
But Dietz must not allow himself to  be cheated again as he was by 
a See this volume, p. 243 — b L. Brentano, Die Arbeitergilden den Gegenwart. Bd. 1-2, Leipzig,

Sonnenschein through Stepniak 288 over the £25, which was just money 
thrown down the drain and which, besides, gives English publishers a false 
impression of their German colleagues business acumen. One ought not to 
make oneself an object of derision to such people. The only way to impress 
Englishmen is to insist on one’s rights. 
Well then, if one is to protect one’s translation rights, the first part of the 
translation must, in accord ance with international law, be published one year 
after the appearance of the original. In that case one  is protected for three 
years in the country and language concerned, Otherwise not. According to 
this, neither Howell nor his publishera have a claim to anything, legally 
speaking. Only considerations of decen cy could come into it. If Dietz is 
willing to conduct negotiations with Howell via Aveling (who is well 
acquainted with such matters) on a verbal basis and authorise him to offer, 
say, £2.10 = 50 marks, if pushed. Howell would probably consent to the 
translation absolutely gratis. I don’t see why one should needlessly stuff 
money down the throats of the supercilious English so that they can brag to 
us Continentals about the commercial value of their books not only here but 
over there, while we poor devils are expected to be grateful when they do us 
the honour of translating us, even though we haven’t been asked. And that 
blackguard Howell, to boot! 
2. I can understand that you should wish to go to Vienna. 289 Austria is 
now the most important country in Europe, at any rate for the moment. It is 
here that the initiative lies, which in a year or two will have its repercussions 
in Germany and other countries. The good Taafe has set the ball rolling and 
it won’t come to a halt so very soon. 270 Such being the case, it is only natural 
that every Austrian should wish to co-operate, for there’s going to be enough 
to do. I was delighted with the Viennese; they are splendid fellows if 
sanguine, sanguine to a degree, no Frenchman could do better, and that 
means that they should not be spurred on but rather reined in, lest the fruits 
of long years of work be dissipated in a single day. Last night Ede read out to 
me what you had written to him about an  article on the strike as a political 
weapon. I firmly advised him against writing the article. 290 To my mind the 
affair of the three-class electorate 291 has already earned him quite enough of 
a reputation as a man who has lost touch with the masses and who, from 
without, from his writing-desk , discourses in doctrinai re fashion on questions 
of immediate practical

moment.a But I am also generally of the opi nion that the effect of such an 
article could not be other than extremely harmful at this particular juncture. 
However cautious it might be, and however impartial and considered the 
language in which it was couched, the Vienna Volkstribüne would pick out 
the passages that suited its own book, reprint them in bold type and use them 
to scare off those who have enough trouble as it is in restraining the Viennese 
from embarking on hare-brained escapades . You say yourself that barricades 
are out of date (though they might come in handy again as soon as a third or 
two-fifths of the army had turned socialist and it was imperative that they be 
given an opportunity of ch anging sides), but a political  strike must either 
score an immediate victory—simply by  means of a threat (as in Belgium 276 
where the army was very shaky) —or else end in a colossal fiasco or, finally, 
lead direct to barricades. And this in Vienna where you could be shot down 
without more ado by Czechs, Croats, Ruthenians, 292 etc. Once this business 
in Vienna has been settled one way or the other, either with or without a 
political general strike, the question w ill still be topical enough for the Neue 
Zeit. But just now a public discussion of the general theoretical pros and cons 
of this weapon could only be grist to the mill of the FIREBRANDS in Vienna. I 
know how difficult it is for Victor to counteract the magic power exerted on 
the Viennese masses by the catchword ‘general strike’ and how happy he will 
be if only he can put off the day of reckoning. That being so we ought, in my 
opinion, to take the utmost care not to do or say anything that might 
encourage the impetuous elements. 
The Viennese working men should wa it until the suffrage has given them 
the means to take stock of themselves and of their friends in the provinces; 
they will then be appraised of their strength and of how it compares with that 
of their opponents. 
Incidentally, things might get to the stage when a general strike would be 
carried out under the aegis and more or less for the benefit of Electoral 
Reform Minister Taaffe. That would be the height of irony. 
3. Once again my thanks for the Parlamentärismusb which you presented 
to me personally in Zurich.

mission provided that Laura also agrees. I have hardly seen anything of 
Tussy lately—since I got back 189—and then only for an odd moment or so. 
Both of them are tremendously busy and,  because of meetings, they hardly 
ever put in an appearance on Sundays. However I should like to take another 
look at the letter before I say anything definite. The matter is open to 
considerable misinterpretation and must be given much thought. 
5. Volume II I.a Fair sheets. When the time comes I shall see to it that 
these sheets are placed at your or Ede’s disposal section by section, pro 
vided, that is, I can get them out of Meissner. For I already need another 
copy for the Russian translation and Meissner is growing old and is no 
longer so accommodating as in the pa st. However I shall do my best. 
There are six sections in all, each of which I shall send you separately after 
it has come off the press. 
Since returning I haven’t done a stroke of work on the above but next 
week I hope finally to buckle to again. 
6. The thing by Guillaumin and V. Pareto has just been sent to me by 
Lafargue—extracts were made by Lafargue; the introduction was evi 
dently written by a bogus vulgar economist. 293 
To come back to the general strike, you ought not to forget that nobody 
was more delighted than the Belgian leaders that the affair should have 
turned out so well. They have had an anxious enough time and might have 
been forced to implement their threat; they themselves knew only too well 
how little they could accomplish.  And this in a primarily industrial country 
with a thoroughly shaky and ill-disciplined militia-style army. But if, in such 
a country, there was nevertheless a chance of achieving something with this 
weapon, 276 what hope could there be in Austria where the peasant 
predominates, industry is sparse and relatively weak, the big towns are few 
and far between, the nationalities have b een set at odds with one another and 
the socialists make up less than ten per cent of the total population (of adult 
males, naturally)! So for heaven’s sake let us avoid taking any step that might 
tempt the working men, who are in any case impatient and thirsting for 
action, to stake their all on one card—a nd, what’s more, at a time when the 
government wants this and could use provocation to bring it about. 
The Vorwärts will always remain the same old Vorwärts. Of that I was 
left in no doubt while in Berlin. So I’m glad that the weeklyb is to come 
a of Capital- b Der Sozialdemokrat  
=====第253页=====
Letters- 1893 227 
out, for it will give the party an opportunity  of appearing, at least in foreign 
eyes, in a form it need not be ashamed of. The Vorwärts comes out in Berlin, 
is read almost exclusively in Berlin (nine-tenths of sales) and, as a product of 
Berlin, is always viewed with indulge nce. The weekly w ill also act as a 
counterweight to the Vorwärts influence on the rest of the party press. How 
things will work out as regards the mutual relationship of the two organs 
remains to be seen. I don’t imagine th at they will come to blows. The 
Vorwärts’ subsidiary title of ‘Central Organ’ is of no importance whatever. 
They are welcome to the catchword. 
At any rate, all kinds of changes are taking place in our party press, I am 
curious to know what will become of the Neue Zeit; 85 its reversion to a 
monthly was at all events a bold move. I don’t believe that in the long run 
the weekly will prove a serious competitor. 
So the best of luck when you visit Vienna. When you get there you might 
pay my respects to the Lowenbräu next to the Burgtheater; it used to be our 
midday headquarters. 
With regards from household to household.

 ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 
IN VIENNA 
London, 10 November 1893  
Dear Victor,

misgivings, for it seems to me that such possibilities are too remote

and by now may to some extent be excluded. Make sure that the letter is 
destroyed as requested. 
My letter of 11 Octobera crossed with yours of the same date. You will 
have seen that we are fully in agreem ent as regards our general view of the 
situation in Austria, a situation that seems to me rather more favourable now 
than it was then. Electoral reform, taking Taaffe’s Bill as the minimum, will 
no longer be relegated to the background in Vienna. The Emperorb has 
approved it and the Emperor cannot back down. He, however, is far more 
representative of Austria than the Di et. It would seem that the new-born 
coalition goverment is already expiring, but even if this is not the case, it will 
come to grief at the first sign of pos itive action. Even if, as August supposes, 
it were to marshall the forces of Baernreitherism, 294 that would be no more 
than a very temporary expedient and would not prevent a collapse, should the 
question of action arise in some other quarter. This much is certain; Austria is 
now in the van of the European political movement, while we others limp 
along behind—even those count ries that already have universal suffrage will 
not be able to elude the impulse provided by Austria. At Ronacher they 
wanteds set-to. 295 If you succeed it keeping the chaps on a tight rein, you 
can’t go wrong. The one thing that might bring Windischgrätz, Plener and 
Jaworski together would be a set-to in Vienna and a victory combined with a 
fusillade. 
Over here we’re doing very nicely, In matters of serious reform the Liberal 
government is proving an abject failure. Even the Fabian society 43 has 
foresworn its allegiance and disavowed its whole policy of permeation. See 
the article by Autolycus (Burgess) on page one of the Workman’s Timesc on 
the Fabian manifesto which appeared in the Fortnightly Review.d If the 
Liberals can’t do any better, there’ll be a mass of Labour candidates come the 
next elections, and between thirty and forty will probably get in. In the 
municipal elections on 1 November the working men of the North began to 
take stock of themselves a nd scored a good many successes. 
Regards from Louise and yours,

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 43 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, November 11, 1893  
Dear Sorge, 
Herewith a letter to Mrs Kelley (ex-Wischnewetzky) which I would ask 
you kindly to forward to her.a As soon as you know her present correct 
address, perhaps you would also be so good as to forward her the enclosed 
cheque for £l.12.11 of the Union Bank of London. 
You should read the article by Autolycusb (Burgess) 43 on page 1 of today’s 
Workman’s Times on the Fabians’ manifesto.c These gentlemen, who for 
years have declared that the emancipa tion of the working class can only be 
accomplished through the Great Liberal Pa rty, who have loudly proclaimed 
that during elections any independent action by the workers vis-à-vis other 
candidates, Liberals included, is cove rt Toryism, who have let it be known 
that the permeation of the liberal party by socialist principles is the sole 
object in life for a Socialist, 59 now declare that the Libe rals are traitors, that it 
is impossible to deal with them and that in the next elections the workers 
should, without regard for Liberals or Tories, put up their own candidates 
with the help of £30,000 which are meanwhile to be found by the Trades 
Unions—assuming that the latter do the Fabians this favour, which they 
assuredly won’t. It is an outright paterpeccatid by these supercilious 
bourgeois who would graciously condescend to liberate the proletariat from 
above, provided only that the latter were sensible enough to realise that such 
a raw, uneducated mass could

not liberate itself and would come to  nothing save by the grace of these 
canny advocates, literati and sentimental old women. And now the first 
attempt by these gentlemen, an attempt heralded by drums and trumpets as a 
worldshaking event, has gone so splendidly awry that they themselves must 
admit as much. That is what’s so funny about the affair. 
Warm regards to you and your wife . I hope you will both get through this 
winter better than the last. Over here it is already starting to turn wintry.

 ENGELS TO PAUL  LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 19 November 1893  
My dear Lafargue, 
Liebknecht will have written telling you that they want to take you on as 
correspondent for Vorwärts and the Hamburg Echo, one letter a week, 
identical and sent simultaneously to the two journals, but they want it in 
German and suggest that Laura should translate it. 
Herein the reason why they want it in German, and it is a very important 
one. The two papers could publish the identical report on the same day, so 
that it would be an original article in each of them. If publication is not 
simultaneous, if one of the two papers prints it a day later, it will be 
suspected of having taken the article from the previous day’s issue of the 
other, like so many other news items taken from that issue. 
Now there might be someone in Hamburg who would translate you— 
don’t ask me how!—but in Berlin! There Liebknecht has established the 
custom of all translations being done by Mme Liebknecht or by one of his 
sons. The manuscript goes to Charlottenburg and into Liebknecht ‘s house 
and God alone knows when the tran slation reaches the newspaper 
=====第258页=====

office. So there would be perpetual delays and, what is worse, delays of 
unpredictable length. 
Therefore, the possibility of using your letters for the two papers and 
paying you a correspondent’ salary depe nds entirely on your letters being 
sent in German. Furthermore this would safeguard you against editorial 
criticism; Bonnier tells me that Lie bknecht rather overdid it with Guesde, 
which is what finally sickened him. The Hamburg editorial board, being 
entirely independent and, what is more, not knowing what goes on in Berlin 
and vice versa, your articles would be printed without being cut either in the 
one or the other paper, or, which is most likely, in both. 
The question now is, will Laura be willi ng to do the translation? I hope so; 
that would enable you to clinch the matter at once. I am sure that with a little 
practice she would write as well in German as in English and French. 
But, if this fails, would there be no way of having the translation done? Is 
there nobody who, in consideration of a small share of your fees, would do 
this job for you? Let us say 10 francs a letter for the translation and two copies, 
which would leave you 40 francs a letter, and would still provide an incentive 
to the translator. What about Frankel? But perhaps he himself is a Vorwärts 
correspondent (I have no idea at all who provides the Paris letters which I see 
in it from time to time). Anyway, think about it and try to arrange something. 
You realise that our Berlin people are doing their utmost, try to facilitate the 
business for them. And don’t forget that  this will enable you to speak to 
60,000-70,000 subscribers, i.e., at least 250,000 readers without counting the 
readers of other papers who borrow their articles from these two organs, the 
most important ones that our Party in Germany has. 
In any case, make a start with Vorwärts and leave the arrangements for the 
Echo and the translation for later. But it would be wise not to lose time over 
it. And further: Bebel as well as Liebknecht insist upon a regular 
contribution which will give them the outstanding events and your 
reflections and reports on the general situation. One letter a week, and on a 
fixed day, determined by yourself (I do not think they will lay down the day 
for you). 
My love to Laura from whom I am still awaiting adamanta and other news.

ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT 297 
IN BERLIN 
London, 1 December 1893  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
Thank you very much for your letter and kind good wishes for my 73rd 
birthday which I passed in the best of health and spirits. The Avelings and 
Bernsteins spent the evening with us, and empty bottles bore testimony to 
our good humour and general sense of we ll-being. If things go on like this 
there will, so far as I am concerned, be no reason why I should not repeat my 
visit to Berlin, 189 in which case we could again take coffee in the Zoological 
Gardens and comment upon the four-l egged and two-legged, winged and 
wingless, roaring and talking zoological specimens on display, whether in 
captivity or at large. 
Poor Gizycki! He’s unable to walk as it is, and now they are also trying to 
prevent him from talking, and this, becau se he illicitly consorts with Social 
Democrats. Prussia is indeed not only a civilised state, but also a state of 
illuminati! 
I am very sorry that y our Karl should have acqui red fibrositis while on His 
Majesty’s service but let us hope he will soon get over it. At all events the 
best thing to do, once one finds oneself in those circumstances, is to carry out 
one’s duties properly. I can readily imagine that messieurs les officiers will 
take care not to compromise themse lves in the eyes of your sons,a those two 
sappers being uncomfortably close to the portals of the

Reichstag, for they are reluctant to figure personally in the debates there, 
no matter what the Minister of Wara may say. And if in addition your 
sons, as used to be demanded of us volunteers 255 by my erstwhile captain, 
set ‘an example to the company’ then , their father notwithstanding, they 
cannot fail to gain promotion to non-commissioned rank. And that 
would be only right and proper. If Bebel is the son of an N.C.O., why 
should not Liebknecht be the father of one or more N.C.O.s? You’ve no 
idea how much nicer a uniform looks, with lace on, and, it would seem, 
that in Berlin the fair sex is far more susceptible to Moloch thus adorned. 
Nor is that by any means all, for as Heine says: 
But still more charming than all else Are 
Caesar’s golden epaulettesb 
However, we are unlikely to ri se to such heights as that. 
Well, the year of mourning in unifo rm will soon be over and then Karl 
will go to Hamm 298 which is also a very nice spot—or used to be; it was my 
mother’s birthplace and I often used  to go there as a child, but now 
everything has changed and it’s a smoky, industrial sort of hole, though quite 
tolerable to live in. 
Well, goodbye now, and please give my warm regards to Liebknecht and 
your children. We shall hold Liebknecht to his promise of coming here after 
the New Year. Mrs Kautsky also sends you all her warmest regards. 
Ever yours,

Dear Sorge, 
Many thanks to you and your wife for your good wishes and for your 
letter of 19 November. 
I am very sorry to hear that you are suffering from gout and hope that it 
will recede as time goes on; it’ s an insidious complaint. 
The repeal of the silver purchase law 187 has saved America from a serious 
financial crisis and will help to promot e an industrial recovery. But I am not 
sure whether it might not have been better had there really been a crash. The 
phrase ‘cheap money’ seems to be deeply engraved in the minds of your 
Western farmers. In the first place, when  they suppose that, if there be ample 
means of circulation in a country, the rate of interest must fall, they are 
confusing means of circulation with disposable money capital, a matter upon 
which considerable light will be shed in Volume II I.a And, secondly, all 
debtors find it convenient to incur de bts in good currency and subsequently 
pay them off in depreciated currency. Hence every indebted Prussian Junker 
clamours for bimetallism 299 that would rid him of his debts in disguised, 
Solonic fashion. 300 Had it been possible to postpone silver reform in the 
United States until there had been time for the consequences of this 
foolishness to redound on the farmers also, it would have dinned some sense 
into many a thick skull. 
Tariff reform, 301 however slowly it may be put into operation, would 
already seem to have given rise to a kind of panic among the manufacturers 
of New England. I have learnt—both from private sources and the 
newspapers—that large numbers of workers are being laid off. But all this 
will die down the moment the Bill goes through and puts an end to the 
uncertainty. I am convinced that, in all the larger branches of industry, 
America can boldly go into competition with England. 
As regards the German Socialists in  America, things are pretty dire.

236 Letters- 1893 
The chaps you get from Germany are not as a rule the best—these stay over 
here—and are not in any case a fair samp le of the German party. And, like 
everywhere else, every new arrival at  once feels impelled to destroy and 
refashion everything that already exists  so that a new era may be seen as 
having started with him. Moreover, the majority of these greenhorns remain 
stuck in New York for a long time if not for life, they are constantly being 
reinforced by new importations and are thus relieved of the necessity of 
learning the language of the country or acquiring a proper knowledge of 
American conditions. All this does a great deal of harm no doubt, but on the 
other hand there is no denying that conditions in America present 
considerable and peculiar difficulties to the steady growth of a labour party. 
In the first place the constitution, based as in England on party gov-
ernment, whereby any vote not given to a candidate put up by one of the two 
government parties is regarded as lost. And neither an American nor an 
Englishman, since he wishes to infl uence the body politic, will throw away 
his vote. 
Then, and more especially, immigration, which splits the workers into two 
groups, native-born and foreign, and the latter again into 1. Irish, 2. 
Germans, 3. a number of smaller groups, each speaking only its own lan-
guage—Czechs, Poles, Italians, Scandina vians, etc. And, in addition, the 
negroes. To form a party of one’s own out of all these calls for exceptionally 
strong incentives. Every now and again a powerful élan may suddenly make 
itself felt, but all the bourgeoisie has to do is to stick it out passively, 
whereupon the dissimilar working-class elements will disintegrate again. 
3. Finally, the protective tariff system and the steady growth of the 
domestic market must have exposed the workers to a prosperity unlike 
anything that has been experienced fo r many years in Europe, (with the 
exception of Russia where, however, it is not the workers who reap the 
benefit but the middle classes). 
A country like America, when really ripe for a socialist labour party, is 
certainly not going to be deterred by a handful of German socialist 
doctrinaires. 
Part I of Vol. II I (246 ms. pages out of approx. 1855) is ready for press.a 
This is between ourselves. Progress will, I hope, now be rapid.

Dear Baron, 
First of all my warmest thanks for your good wishes on my 73rd birthday 
which has left me fit and well. 
Either you misinterpreted my remarks about the ‘publisher’ or I expressed 
myself badly.a It never occurred to me to lay the blame on Dietz or, indeed, 
any one individual, in as much as I was not sufficiently au fait with what had 
happened over there in regard to the Stepniak business 288 before this had 
come to my notice. I merely adduced it as an awful example that ought not to 
be followed. And in view of the position occupied by publishers in this 
country, there could be no doubt that the German publisher had gratuitously 
presented Sonnenschein (or so it must seem to him) with £25, which could 
not but give him, Sonnenschein, a somewhat indifferent idea of the business 
efficiency of German publishers. Nor can

you Stuttgarters contest this. And as the surest way of obviating anything of 
that kind, I drew your attention to the fact that, in this country, the consent of 
the author is not in itself, a safeguard since, in nine cases out of ten, the 
English publisher has the final say, for as a rule he has been assigned the 
copyright, including right of translation (this is actually stated in print in, for 
instance, every one of Sonnenschein’s contract forms, or else he stipulates 
that he should have some say in the matter. So please tell Dietz that it never 
even crossed my mind to cast any aspersion whatsoever on his efficiency as 
a business man. 
As regards international contracts, Sam Moore [originally] looked this up 
in PARLIAMENTARY PUBLICATIONS fro m which he made extracts, and 
the information about one year and three years was certainly correct at that 
time. I know nothing about the Berne Convention 303 and its ten-year term of 
copyright for translations and I should be grateful if you would let me know 
the date of the said Convention, in which case I could procure the copy made 
for Parliament. 
Victor writes to say that the general st rike in Austria is dead as a door nail; 
so a discussion of it would not be likely to do any harm.a But at the same 
time we have had inquiries from the Austrian provinces as to what we in this 
country think of a general strike. 
I still believe that electoral reform, at least in the form hatched up by 
Taaffe and Franz Joseph, is a foregone conclusion in Austria. 270 Even if the 
coalition ministry succeeds in tabling and gaining acceptance for a Bill for 
the extension of the parliamentary franchise without, as it must, foundering in 
consequence, or in consequence of something else in the meantime, the 
matter will by no means be settled. In a country as artificially equilibrated as 
Austria, a stable balance, once destroye d, can be restored only with difficulty, 
maybe by force alone, and the government is only too well aware that even 
this will be effective only for a while and will leave the state weaker than it 
was before. And the fact that Franz Joseph has given his blessing to this 
particular piece of electoral reform whic h he has, indeed, declared to be his 
very own work, rules out once and for all the possibility of Austria 
continuing as before. Now it’s

In all probability Taaffe will return to office after a certain interval; he 
would seem to have taken the Disraeli of 1867 for his model. 305 At the 
moment this caricature of an artful dodger, along with the irresolute Franz 
Joseph, is involuntarily engaged in making Austria the spearhead of the

My dear Löhr, 
If I have not before  replied  to your letter of just a month  ago, there were 
2 causes for it: 
1) because I was bound to finish, before Christmas, the final redactiona 
a editing 
=====第269页=====
Letters- 1893 243 
of Section I-IV of Vol. II I,a so as to be able to go to press at once after the 
new year. That is now done. By Easter I hope to have the whole of the 
Manuscript (2/3rds are still to be finally looked over) in the printer’s hands, 
to be published in September. 
2) because I had submitted to Bebel another plan 25 for the German 
translation, etc. of Paul’s articles, 13 and was waiting for a reply. Nothing 
however has come of it and so, vogue la galèrec on the present tack, which, 
as far as I can hear, has taken somethi ng like a final shape, and so it may be 
as well to leave things alone. Liebknecht is rather a queer customer to deal 
with in these matters of his redaction. We expect him here after the new 
year. 
Now then, ein anderes Bild.d Yesterday we forwarded to you a box with 
the pudding, Paul’s cake etc., grande vitessee to be there about Wednesday or 
Thursday—Continental Daily Parcels E xpress, carriage paid, which, we 
hope, will arrive safely and suit your ta stes. Bonnier ought to have a slice of 
the pudding for he came in for the stirring and he did stir it with might and 
main. He is improving vastly, shaking off his Germanisms and becoming 
actually French. Some time ago I went over to Oxford for a day, to look at 
the place and also at poor old Rotef Wolffg—your earliest admirer, for he 
admired you before you were 2 years old in Brussels. Poor devil, he is quite 
cracked again. He had written so mething about Bucher in the Neue Zeit,h and 
since then whenever a Wolf or Wolff (and you know they are as plentiful as 
the Smiths and Jones’s) is alluded to, he imagines that this is meant for him, 
and so he makes it out that there is a complete conspiracy to pretend that he 
does not know Latin—and you know, not to know Latin is the awfullest 
crime a man can be guilty of in Oxford. But is it not a melancholy irony of 
fate, that one of the most spirituel 1 of men should end his career in the belief 
that he is the Massmann, not of a Heine, but of an imaginary conspiracy of 
second and third rate German literati! Then he is 81 years old—so, apart

noticed by the bourgeois press abroad; contrasted with the part played by the 
French delegation at Zürich, 250 they might have served as groundwork for a 
lot of bad jokes. But le bon sens français quel quefois n’a pas le sens 
commun,a and that is just the beauty of it. Look at the parti socialiste in the 
Chamber. How long ago is it that Clara Zetkin in the Neue Zeith made out 24 
élusc ± socialistes, and that of the 12 elected on the Marxist program Paul did 
not know how many would turn up all right; and now, lo and behold, a 
parliamentary party of 54 socialist deputies which dashes into the majority 
like a brigade of cavalry, upsets one mini stry and nearly dislocates another, 
308 until this victorious career is a ll of a sudden, by Vaillant’s bomb, 309 
changed into a concentration to th e rear, and the new members of the 
majority deprived of all the idealistic delusions they had brought with them 
from the provinces and turned into docile panamitard opportunists. 60 
Upon the whole I think it is rather useful to us. I cannot help imagining 
that amongst these 54 who have been many of them suddenly converted to 
what they call socialism, there cannot be that cohesion which is wanted for a 
serious fight. Let alone the old dissensions between the real old socialists ‘de 
la veille’ d within the group, dissensions wh ich it will take some time to 
overcome once for all. If this heterogeneous lot of 54 had been kept in the 
front rank of the chambre for any length of time, it must, either have split up, 
or else the old Radical wing—Millerand and Co.—must have become the 
determining element. As it is, time w ill be given to the various components 
of the group to make closer acquaintan ce with each other, to consolidate the 
group, and to eliminate, if necessary, one after another those elements which 
really have joined the group only by mistake. At all events, in the Dupuy—
Casimir Périer campaign M illerand and Jaurès took the lead entirely, and that 
will never do in the long run, though I fu lly approve of Guesde and Vaillant 
having, so far, and under the present circumstances, kept in the background. 
Paul’s letters to the Vorwärts so far are very good, we look for them every 
week. And they are not quite so badly germanised as I have seen others 
done.

My dear Schorlemmer, 
If I have not written before now to thank you for your good wishes on my 
seventy-third birthday, you can blame it on Volume II I of Capital. This must 
now be finished once and for all and consequently I have had to put the 
whole of my correspondence on one side without compunction or remorse. I 
have now one section left to be done a nd shall be able to use the few days 
remaining before the festive season to catch up. 
I only passed through Darmstadt 189—Mrs Kautsky, Bebel and wife, a 
Viennese doctor 1 resident over here and I were unable to ascertain the train 
in advance, which in any case only stopped for ten minutes or so, otherwise I 
should have telegraphed you. Otherwise the trip was very pleasant—apart 
from the tub-thumping I had to do, having once let my-

self in for it in Zurich. I travelled with Bebel to Salzburg, Vienna, Prague 
and Berlin and was away from home for a full two months, which did me a 
power of good. To observe the progress made in Germany both by industry 
and by the labour movement was in itself worthwhile, and to see our 
Viennese at work was also a pleasure. 
As regards Carl’s estate, 199 I have heard very little from Siebold and 
absolutely nothing about what has happened to the manuscripts and what 
contracts have been concluded with the publishers. Three matters are 
involved here: 
1. The big work by Roscoe and Schorlemmer in an English and a German 
edition. 311 
2. Carl’s own Manual of the Chemistry of the Carbon Compoundsa new 
edition of which was in course of preparation. 
3. His manuscripts on the early history of chemistry 312 (according to what 
Spiegel says in the obituary, Siebold intends to publish this himself). 
The English edition of Carl’s Ursprung und Entwicklung der organischen 
Chemieb 313 will be handled in London by one of his pupils, now a professor 
there.c 
But with regard to the above three points Siebold says  little or nothing, 
Before I write to him again, I should like to ask you whether he has told you 
anything about the matter and if so what, and whether it is agreeable to you if 
I ask him for further information. Fo r I have no right whatever, legally 
speaking, to intervene and would not like Siebold to refer to or even so much 
as hint at this. If, however, I go and ask him for information for which you 
have appealed to me, that is rather a different matter and puts me in an 
altogether different position. 
Siebold is an absolutely sterling chap  but by nature not  over-energetic and 
in recent years he has been  weakened by illness. In  which case a little bit of 
extra help can do no harm. 
I hope you are safely rid of your influenza and your wife of the after-ef-
fects of pneumonia and are in a cond ition to face up to the coming festive 
season with strength, fortitude and cheerfulness. 
With kindest regards. 
Yours,

Dear Liebknecht, 
Yesterday evening I sent you an article on Italy. I would ask you NOT to 
print it until further notice. I fear I have misinterpreted the permission given me 
to publish it, which, apparently, does NOT extend to the stuff about the privy 
purse. Since the matters in question could land my sourcea in a most serious 
predicament and might deprive me of the source itself, I am also sending you a 
telegram. If you receive no further word  from me, you can bring the ms. back 
with you in January and we shall then re-edit it. 
Once again my kindest regards to you all.

thanks. First of all a Happy New Year  to you and your wife from Louise 
Kautsky and myself. 
You will have noticed, not without some  surprise, that a Socialist group of 
between fifty-four and sixty men (they themselves don’t seem to know 
exactly how many) has established itself in the French Cham ber. Immediately 
after the elections 208 they numbered, at a generous count, twenty-four, twelve 
of whom had been elected on the strength of the Marxist platform. However, 
of these only six presented themselves at the Paris Party Congress and 
hitherto only four have agreed, in accordance with the c ongress resolution, to 
pay a part of their parliamentary salary into the party treasury. 283 (Which is 
not yet the same thing as actually paying it in—in France it was being said as 
early as 1870 that les cotisations ne rentrent pas!a) Well, thanks to the 
adhesion of the radicaux socialistesb of the Millerand-Jaurès group, there are 
now all of a sudden nearly sixty who have resolved to include the 
socialisation of the means of production as one of the aims—more immediate 
for some, for others, however, ve ry remote—of their programme. 
Concentration is now the battle-cry in France. If in the past this meant a 
concentration républicaine (i.e. the subordination of all Republicans to the 
right wing, the Opportunists 87), it now means a concentration socialiste and I 
only hope this does not mean the subordination of all Socialists to the 
Millerandists whose practical programme is assuredly more radical than 
socialist. 
The first result of this alliance is th at our people have as good as lost the 
chance of acquiring a daily of their own. Millerand’s Petite République 
Française already occupies that position, so  it will be difficult to produce an 
organ to compete with it—finance is more difficult to obtain and the others 
would complain that it would mean splitting the party! The more so as the 
Petite République Française is crafty enough to open its columns to any 
socialist group. 
The second is that in the group’s m eetings the Millerandists command an 
absolute majority (ca. 30 against 24 at  the most—Marxists (12), Allemanists 
21 (3-5), Broussists 30 (2) and Blanquists 20 (4-6)).  
Nevertheless messieurs les Français, intoxicated once again by victory, 
are crowing away for the benefit of all and sundry and would like to resume 
their place at the forefront of the m ovement. They have tabled a motion 
demanding that the standing army be changed into an army of

militia (Vaillant), while Guesde intends to table one on a European disar-
mament congress.a The plan is that the Germans and Italians shall table 
similar motions in their own parliaments, thereby naturally giving the 
impression that they are following in th e footsteps of their French ‘leaders’. 
What the handful of Italians—and an exceptionally muddle-headed handful 
at that—may do is of no consequence, but whether our Germans will consent 
without more ado to be taken in tow by the French seems doubtful to me. If, 
after twenty-five years of hard struggl e, you have won for yourself a position 
of power and have two million voters behind you, you are entitled to take a 
closer look at the scratch lot who propose all of a sudden to assume 
command. The more so as messieurs les Français get exceedingly touchy the 
moment anyone commits the slightest breach of etiquette in respect of 
themselves. 
Well, we shall have to wait and see. With these unpredictable Frenchmen 
it is always possible that lasting pr ogress will result from this sudden and 
momentary success. But it would really be better for us to wait and see. 
Next, I have to tell you— but this is strictly between ourselves —that 
yesterday the first third of the ms. of Volume II P was packed in strong oil-
cloth (as was in its day that notorious forgery, the Cologne minute-book 315) 
and will shortly be sent to the printers. The last two-thirds are still in need of 
the final—mostly technical—editing. If all goes well the book will come out 
in September. 
Now for something else. Prof. Labriolac of Rome, with whom I have 
corresponded for several years and whom I met in Zurich, 189 is giving a 
course of lectures at the university there on the genesis of Marxist theory. He 
is a strict Marxist. To this end he has procured all the necessary literature but 
has never managed to set eyes on the Holy Family, although he has 
advertised in the Leipzig Buchändlerblatd and elsewhere to the effect that he 
will pay ‘any price’ for it. There was some prospect of his getting a copy on 
loan from Switzerland, but its ownere has suddenly vanished and is said to be 
travelling in Hungary. He is now urging me to do whatever I can to procure 
him a copy for three or four weeks. But I myself have only one and if that is 
lost it will be absolutely impossible for me to arrange for the inclusion of the 
new, later edition in the projected Collected Works. 316

Hence I cannot, on any account, let this one and only copy out of my hands. 
Now, a few years back, I sent you my spare copy. Would you be so good as 
to lend it to me for the above purpose for five or six weeks? You could send 
it to me as a BOOK-PACKET by registered post or, if you prefer, through an 
express agency insured for any sum you choose, and I should return it by 
whichever medium you may direct. I would, if that could somehow be 
arranged, send it to Rome through an agency, heavily insured (for 410 say) 
or, if that is not possible, by registered post. It should be stipulated that 
Labriola might have the use of it for a maximum of  four weeks. I need hardly 
tell you that without a knowledge of th is book he will be unable to hold the 
proposed course of lectures, still less r ealise his intention of publishing them 
at a later date. There are fewer than si x copies in the whole of the German 
party and who has them I don’t know. So please think the matter over.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 3 January 1894  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
My dear Lafargue, 
First, seasonal greetings to Laur a and you from Louise and myself. 
And now for your disarmament plan. I saw the Vaillant motion in Le Parti 
Socialiste, I did not have it from Laura. 317 Neither this paper nor your letter 
tells me whether it has already been tabled or if that is still to come. 
The Germans have been demanding for years that the standing army 
should be turned into a militia, this is repeated in all their Reichstag speeches 
on militarism, the war budget, etc., repeated ad nauseam. I fail to see that the 
formal tabling of a Bill could add anyt hing to it. Nevertheless, they will look 
into it. 
As for the proposal to be made concerning a disarmament congress, that 
would be—like Vaillant’s motion also— a matter to be settled by a 
conference of delegates from the three parliaments: French, German and 
Italian. One delegate from each nati on would be enough. Any international 
action must have as a necessary premis e a previous agreement both as to the 
basis and as to the form. It strikes me as inadmissible that one nationality 
should take the initiative publicly and then  invite the others to fall in. The 
French, themselves pretty punctilious at  times on matters of etiquette, should 
for their part observe democratic consid erations. I shall not call the Germans’ 
attention to this point, but I should not be surprised if this rather naïve 
invitation, to follow in the footsteps of the 
=====第279页=====
Letters- 1894 253 
French party, which has only just got into Parliament and is made up of such 
diverse and in some respects such little  known elements, is not immediately 
accepted. 
Now for the substance. 
The Vaillant motion will be opposed by the military on the ground that 
militias on the Swiss model, po ssibly good enough for a mountainous 
country, lack the stability n eeded for a large army that  has to operate on every 
kind of terrain. And there they will be  right. To build a good militia army the 
foundation must be laid by the athletic  and military training of the young; so 
it’s a thing which would take from five to eight years; you would not have 
this militia until about the end of the centu ry. Therefore if ther e is to be a Bill 
against which the bourgeois and the m ilitary cannot raise valid objections, 
this fact must be taken into account. 
That is what I tried to do in the articles which appeared last year in 
Vorwärts and which I sent you.a I am sending you a further copy today. Here 
I am proposing an international agreement for the reduction—simultaneous 
and agreed jointly in advance—of the period of military service. To meet the 
usual prejudices as far as possible, I am proposing for a start a period of two 
years’ enlistment, to be reduced as soon as possible to 18 months (two 
summers and the winter between), and then to one year and so on, until a 
class of young men have reached milita ry age who shall have been through 
that athletic and military instruction which shall have fitted them to bear 
arms without further training. And then  there would be a militia that would 
require no more than large-scale manoeuvres every 2 or 3 years to find its 
feet and to learn how to operate in large formations. 
Now that the two-year period is already generally recognised one could 
demand 18 months at once, and reduction to 1 year in 2 or 3 years; during 
that time, the athletic and military training of young men between 15 and 18 
could be set going, not forgetting that of boys between 10 and 15. 
Vaillant’s Bill has great need for re vision by someone who knows what’s 
what in military affairs, it contains things written in haste on which we could 
not stand up to serious argument. According to art. 9 {all the children of the 
country), the girls, too, are to be put through “all the evolu- 
a F. Engels, “Can Europe Disarm?”  
=====第280页=====
254 Letters- 1894 
tions of the infantry, cavalry and artillery”, etc., etc. 
I am sending a copy of my articles to Vaillant, too. 
Now then, if you could reach agreemen t with the Germans and the Italians 
for tabling a motion aimed at calling for a congress on disarmament and the 
transition—by simultaneous stages laid down in advance— to a militia 
system, that would be a splendid thing and have a big effect. But for mercy’s 
sake don’t spoil it by openly taking the initiative wit hout preliminary 
consultation with the others. The conditions of internal policy as well as 
those governing each parliament are so  different from each other that a 
certain manner of proceeding may be ex cellent for one country and utterly 
impossible or even disastrous in another. 
The anarchist bomb 309 will become a thing of the past as have the glorious 
2,500 francs of the Germans. 278 This will have an effect vis-à-vis the police; 
look at the Madrid verdict in the Munoz case where the police was found 
guilty, too; 318 and in France it risks being openly implicated in the affair of 
bombs; if it slips off this time, it might be glad. This pitcher has been going 
to the well long enough, and it is about to be broken at last. 
I hope that Laura has received her manuscript. 310 
Kiss Laura on my behalf. Greetings from Louise. 
Ever yours,

It would seem that, despite the harmony between Carnot and the tsar,a it 
will be the French, and not the outlawed Russians who will suffer perse-

to stand on a par with the great Florentine.a However, I have found nothing

Dear Baron, 
Ede has doubtless already told you of the despatch of part of the ms. of 
Volume II I (approx. 1/3 of a cubic foot). Now that it has safely arrived in 
Hamburg, I am able to give you a short review of it for the Neue Zeit and this 
I enclose.a Please send a copy with the article side-lined to Otto Meissner’s 
Verlag, Hamburg. 
Work is continuing on the second third which I hope will soon be ready. 
Your good wishes for Xmas as well as for the New Year were gratefully 
reciprocated in thought if not in words. 
I shall now probably be able to get hold of the Berne Convention.b 303 
I am anxious to see Cunow’s book.c The man has done a great deal of 
swotting in his field and keeps his eyes open. 
Dietz will be interested to hear that Laura Lafargue is translating my 
Feuerbach into French for the Ère nouvelle 310 and subsequent publication as 
an off-print. I have already looked over the first part. She translates deftly 
and conscientiously. 
Rave, who is less deserving of such praise, has again written to me; he has 
had a go at your Thomas Morus,d mais c’est bien indigeste!e For the man 
does not, in fact, possess an adequate knowledge of German, although he is 
an Alsatian and by rights should probably be called Rawe. 
I’m glad that Victor should have promptly extracted the best bits from 
your latest article and made them available to the Viennese. 321 They were 
quite admirably suited to the situation there. According to Victor’s last letter, 
all danger of anything silly being done is now past. In fact both the Czech 
and the trades union congresses have shelved the question of a GENERAL

My dear Lamplugh, 
Your parcel was an agreeable surprise  indeed. Many thanks! I am almost 
ashamed to confess that in my ignorance I had fancied the Anatomy of 
Melancholy to be one of the serious psychological disquisitions of the 18th 
century, which I hold in horror. Now I find that it, too, is a product of the 
grandest epoch of English literature, the beginning of the 17th century. I turn 
to it with pleasure, and have already seen enough to assure me that it will 
prove a constant source of enjoyment. 
This reminds me that I have forgotten to let you have the only two works 
of mine that have been published in Englisha—I have made free to send 
them, to you by post and hope you w ill do me the favour of accepting them. 
Dakyns told me on Sunday you were afraid of your little boy getting the 
influenza. Although there is more about of this beastly complaint than is 
desirable, I hope the danger has blown over. 
Reciprocating your kind wishes for the New Year and with kind regards to 
Mrs Lamplugh. 
I remain yours faithfully F.

[Draft]  
[London], 10 January 1894  
Dear citizen, 
A thousand thanks for your good wishes for the New Year, which, I hope, 
will bring you good fortune also! 
The translation of my book, 195 as it is at present, seems to me to be very 
good. As for the rest, since I edited the proofs, I also bear my share of the 
responsibility. 
The style of Thomas Morusa will really seem rather heavy to the French 
public, but there are some good points, and the historical estimates have a 
more than transitory value. 
At the moment I have no book I can offer you for translation, but if I find 
something, I shall let you know. 
Yours respectfully.

family, for your good wishes which I hear tily reciprocate, and thanks also for 
the League tie-pin which I shall sport as soon as I have a suitable necktie to 
wear it with—I intend to buy one specially for the purpose. 
That there is a great deal to be done over there I can readily believe and 
none of us can imagine how you are able to manage it all, and under the most 
difficult circumstances at that. We admi re and envy you your tenacity. What 
particularly pleased me, however, was your assurance that an end has been 
put to the foolishness you had been fear ing over there. I have since received 
reports on the two Congresses 323 and have been able to discover at least 
some of the particulars therefrom. Things couldn’t in fact have gone off 
better in regard to this crucial matter. 
So far as the healthy development of the movement is concerned, it was a 
real blessing that the perspicacious H öger should have declared suffrage to 
be a bourgeois racket and not something to go on strike for, 327 and that the 
miners should, after their own fashion, have declared themselves opposed to 
any strike that did not also support the eight-hour day. And at Budweis the 
Czechs have also helped us by ma king admission conditional on recognition 
of the programme and tactics (à la Zurich 229) and by shelving the general 
strike, which seemed more pervasive there than anywhere else, until the 
Party Conference, 323 when it will probably be shelved again. 
K. Kautsky’s article which you reprinted 321 will be of great help to your 
people. But it’s indicative of the extent to which its author has lost touch 
with the living party movement. A few months ago he showed an 
inconceivable want of tact in proposi ng to sling a purely academic discussion 
of the general strike in abstracto, and of its pros and cons generally, into the 
midst of a movement engaged in a life and death struggle against slogans 
advocating such a strike. 290 And now comes this article which, at any rate in 
the passages you cite, hits the nail on the head quite admirably. 
Anyhow, come next month and the Electoral Reform Bill, and you people 
will (be able to) start agita ting again with a will. It was quite a good thing that 
the first high fever should have had a chance to run its course, for now the 
chaps will take a rather calmer view of things. Whichever way it goes, the 
government and the Diet are bound to place new weapons in your hands and 
next year there will be several score if

not a whole crowd of you in parliament. Proletarians in that anachronistic 
assembly with its class hierarchies! Those chaps will show the French that 
the proletariat is not le quatrième état as, by false analogy, they are so fond 
of describing it, but an utterly modern, youthful class incompatible with all 
that old nonsense of estates which it must disrupt before getting to the stage 
at which it can embark on its own particular task, the disruption of the 
bourgeoisie. I am already looking forward to the day when the first of our 
chaps sets foot in the Diet. 
All the same, I still take the view  that the coalition government will 
collapse the moment it tries to act in real earnest. I should say that in Austria 
the time has not yet come for the one reactionary mass 214—not, at any rate, 
for its formation on a lasting basis. And even if the leaders in the Cabinet 
were to unite, the small fry in parlia ment would not succeed in doing so; and 
if, behind all this, you have a Franz Jo seph yearning to get his Taaffe back, it 
seems to me that the days of Windischgrätz are numbered. And in 
practice Taaffe now stands fo r universal suffrage. 
I am curious to see how the sixty so -called Socialists in the French 
Assembly will make out.b They are a mixed bunch, even some of the so-
cialistes de la veilléc being of a very indeterminate nature and also, despite 
their desire for fusion, encumbered with all manner of old and ugly mem-
ories; on top of that, however, all of these put together are in a minority as 
compared with the Millerand-Jaurès majority consisting of socialistes du 
lendemaind Indeed, the French preserve an obstinate silence in the face of 
any inquiry as to the nature of th eir group. On Sunday Bonnier will be 
passing through London on his way back from Paris; I shall question him 
and, no doubt, succeed in finding something out. 
Volume II Ie is at last being printed. The first twenty chapters (664 pp. out 
of approx. 1870 ms. pp.) have already gone to press, I am working on the 
next third which only requires a final editing, and then it will soon be the 
turn of the last third which will probably call for rather more work. We shall 
be appearing in September, I think. 
But now I must return to my beloved Chapter 23. Unfortunately a frightful 
lot of time was lost over the festive season.

ENGELS TO W. BORGIUS 329 
IN BRESLAUa 
London, 25 January 1894  
 
Dear Sir, 
Herewith the answers to your questions. 
1. By economic relations, considered by us to be the determinant upon 
which the history of society is based, we understand the manner in which 
men of a certain society produce the necessities of life, and exchange 
a Now Wroclaw  
=====第291页=====
Letters- 1894 265 
those products among themselves (in so far as division of labour exists). Thus 
they comprise the entire technology of production and transport. As we see it, 
that technology also determines the manner of exchange, likewise the 
distribution of products and hence, following the dissolution of gentile 
society, also the division into classes, hence the relations of rulers and 
subjects, and hence the state, politics, th e law, etc. Economic relations further 
comprise the geographical basis on which these are enacted, and, indeed, the 
inherited remnants of earlier stages of economic development, remnants 
which often owe their survival only to tradition or vis inertiaea they also, of 
course, comprise the external environmen t by which this form of society is 
encompassed. 
If, as you say, technology is indeed largely dependent on the state of sci-
ence, then how much more is not the latter dependent on the state and the 
requirements of technology? If society has a technological requirement, the 
latter will do more to promote science than ten universities. Hydrostatics 
(Torricelli, etc.) owes its existence so lely to the need to regulate mountain 
streams in Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Only since the 
discovery of its technological uses have we known anything rational about 
electricity. Unfortunately historiographers in Germany have got into the 
habit of writing about the sciences as though they had appeared out of the 
blue. 
2. We see economic conditions as that which, in the final analysis, 
determines historical development. Bu t the human race is itself an economic 
factor. Here, however, there are two points which should not be overlooked: 
a) Political, juridical, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic, etc., 
development is based on economic deve lopment. But each of these also 
reacts upon the others and upon the economic basis. This is not to say that 
the economic situation is the cause and that it alone is active while 
everything else is mere passive effect, but rather that there is reciprocal 
action based, in the final analysis, on economic necessity which invariably 
prevails. The state, for instance, exerts its influence through protective tariffs, 
free trade, good or bad fiscal systems,  and even your German philistine’s 
mortal weariness and impotence, consequent upon Germany’s impoverished 
economic condition between 1648 and 1830,  and expressing itself first in 
Pietism and then in sentimentality and cringing servility 
a the force of inertia  
=====第292页=====
266 Letters- 1894 
to princes and nobles, even this was not without economic effect. It was one 
of the greatest obstacles to recovery and was not removed until chronic 
poverty became acute as a result of th e revolutionary a nd Napoleonic wars. 
Thus the effect of the economic situation is not, as is sometimes 
conveniently supposed, automatic; rather, men make their own history, but in 
a given environment by which they are conditioned, and on the basis of 
extant and actual relations of which economic relations, no matter how much 
they may be influenced by others of a political and ideological nature, are 
ultimately the determining factor a nd represent the unbroken clue which 
alone can lead to comprehension. 
b) While men may make their own history, they have not hitherto done so 
with a concerted will in acco rdance with a concerted pl an, not even in a given 
and clearly delimited society. Their aspi rations are at variance, which is why 
all such societies are governed by necessity of which the counterpart and 
manifestation is chance. The necessity which here invariably prevails over 
chance is again ultimately economic. This brings us to the question of what 
are known as great men. The fact that such and such a man, and he alone, 
should arise at a particular time in any given country, is, of course, purely 
fortuitous. But if we eliminate him, a replacement will be called for and such 
a replacement will be found— tant bien que mal,a but found he will ultimately 
be. That Napoleon, this particular Corsican, was the military dictator 
rendered necessary by a French Republic bled white by her own wars, was 
fortuitous; but that, in the absence of a Napoleon, someone else would have 
taken his place is proved by the fact  that the moment someone becomes 
necessary—Caesar, Augustus, Cromwell, etc.—he invariably turns up. If it 
was Marx who discovered the materialist view of history, the work of 
Thierry, Mignett Guizot and every English historiographer prior to 1850 goes 
to show that efforts were being made in that direction, while the discovery of 
the same view by Morgan shows that the time was ripe for it and that it was 
bound to be discovered. 
The same thing applies to all fortuitous and seemingly fortuitous events in 
history. The further removed is the s phere we happen to be investigating 
from the economic sphere and the closer to the purely abstract, ideological 
sphere, the more likely shall we be to find evidence of the fortuitous in its 
development, and the more irregular will be the curve 
a for better or for worse  
=====第293页=====
Letters- 1894 267 
it describes. But if you draw the mean axis of the curve, you will find that the 
longer the period under consideration and the larger the area thus surveyed, 
the more approximately parallel will this  axis be to the axis of economic 
development. 
In Germany the greatest obstacle to accurate interpretation is the ir-
responsible neglect of economic history in literature. It is so difficult, not 
only to rid oneself of the historical ideas drummed into one at school, but 
actually to get together the material necessary for the purpose. Who, for 
instance, has so much as read old G. von Gülich whose dry catalogue of 
material nevertheless contains so much that throws light on innumerable 
political facts! 
Come to that, I believe that the fine example provided by Marx in the 18. 
Brumaire0 should, precisely because it is a practical example, go a long way 
towards answering your questions. I also think that I touched on most of 
these points in the Anti-Dühring Chapters 9-11 and II , 2-4, also II I, and in 
the introduction, and again in the final section of the Feuerbach.d 
Please do not take every word I have said above for gospel, but rather 
consider them in their general context; I am sorry not to have had the time to 
write to you in such careful detail as I should have had to do for publication. 
Would you kindly convey my compliments to Mr ...e and thank him for 
sending me the ...e which greatly amused me.

ENGELS TO RICHARD FISCHER 
IN BERLIN 
London, 1 February 1894  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
Dear Fischer, 
Discussed the matter with Aveling yesterday. 330 After the Erfurt Party 
Conference, 331 and armed with the documents provided by you, Aveling 
again went to the Daily Chronicle and notified them of the facts (he had 
already been there once before and denounced Reuss as a spy, whereupon 
they had said they would get rid of him). But now all of a sudden the story 
was that the proprietor of the paper wished to keep Reuss on and so there 
was nothing they could do about it. But if Reuss nevertheless asserts that he 
gave notice himself on 9. Nov. 1891, i.e. immediately afterwards, it shows 
that, as a result of what Aveling had to ld them, they treat ed him in such a 
manner as to force him to give notice—the fact remains that he was made to 
go. 
However you cannot publicly ventilate any of these matters because you 
would risk a public denial by the Chronicle people, since etiquette in this 
country strictly precludes publication of  a newspaper’s internal affairs and 
the chaps can thus tell any lies they choose and do so with complete 
impunity. If I were you I should drop the matter altogether since it is no 
longer of any importance whatever. The very most you could say would be 
that the Erfurt Conference took place in October 1891, immediately after 
which the information about Reuss was sent to London and that, as early as 9 
November Reuss had, by his own admissi on, found it necessary to give 
notice—and let the reader draw his own conclusions. Should you venture one 
step further, the Chronicle will state that, so far as it is concerned, the thing 
simply is not true, and neither it nor any other London paper will print a line 
of rectification from you. Such is the etiquette of the press over here. 
We know nothing about Reu ss being pilloried for the second time in the 
Vorwärts; you will have to look for it yourselves. 
Would you pay my fee 332 to the party treasurer who can receipt it in the 
monthly account with the initials F. E. in L.

I do not consider the term ‘communism’ suitable for general use today; 
rather it should be reserved for cases in which a more exact description is

You will have received the card a nnouncing Louise’s marriage. Her 
husband, Dr Freyberger, is a young Viennese doctor who gave up his career 
at Vienna University because they re fused to let him tell the workers about 
the social causes of their illnesses; he has now established himself here and 
has already shown the English that more medicine is to be learned on the 
Continent than in this country. For the time being we shall all continue to 
live together at Regent’s Park Road. 
The Holy Family has arrived safely in Rome and will be returned to me in 
the middle of March, when it will at once be sent on to you.a 
Our strange socialist group in the Fren ch Chamber is still something of a 
mystery. It is not yet very clear how many of them there are or what their 
standpoint is. Guesde tables  vast numbers of Bills none of which, needless to 
say, goes through. Jaurès is unlikely to see a repetition of his first sensational 
victories, since the immediate effect  of the anarchist gentry’s bombing 
exploits 309 has been to provide the Ministry and the cause of law and order 
with a solid majority. 
In this country the official politicia ns, both Liberal and Conservative, are 
in a state of complete disarray. The Liberals can maintain their position only 
by making fresh political and social concessions to the workers, for which, 
however, they lack the courage. Thus , they are trying to do so with an 
election cry against the house of lords instead of proposing payment of 
members, payment of election expenses by the government, and second 
ballot. I.e. instead of offering the workers more power vis-à-vis the 
Commons and  the lords, all they want is to give the Commons more power 
vis-à-vis the lords, and that is something the workers are no longer prepared 
to swallow. But in any case there will be a general election here this summer 
and, unless the Liberals really take their courage in both hands and make 
genuine concessions to the workers, they will suffer defeat and go to pieces; 
at present they are held together only by Gladstone who might kick the 
bucket any day. Then there will be a mi ddle-class democratic party with pro-
Labour tendencies, and what is left  of the Liberals will go over to 
Chamberlain. And all this has come about simply as a result of pressure from 
a working class that is still disunited and only partially conscious. If, in due 
course, it attains full consciousness, things will take an altogether different 
turn.

In Italy something violent might happen any day now. The middle classes 
have retained all the abominations of a feudalism in decay and used them as 
an excuse for their own infamies and tyrannies. The country is at the end of 
its tether, there has got to be a ch ange there, but the Socialist Party 340 is still 
very weak and very muddle-headed, although among its number it can boast 
some really capable Marxists. 
In Austria, too, something is to be anticipated. The funny part of it is that 
Socialists there are looking for support to the Emperor 1 who, by giving his 
blessing to Taaffe’s proposal for electoral reform, 270 has declared himself in 
favour of something that comes close to universal suffrage, in the genuine 
belief that this is a necessary counterpart to general conscription. The 
coalition government won’t succeed in doing anything or, if it does succeed 
in enacting an electoral Bill, this w ill be regarded simply as a bonus, while 
the movement, with the Emperor’s tac it consent, will proceed on its way at 
any rate until such time as Taaffe’s reform is put through. And then our 
chaps will see to the rest. 
In short things are proceeding very merrily everywhere, and prospects for 
the fin de siècle look better every day. 
To judge by appearances, the Workman’s Times is at the point of death. 
Nor is the INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY 114 very much more lively; 
it’s strange how slow and circuit ously everything proceeds over here.

ENGELS TO ADELHEID DWORAK AND JULIUS POPP 
IN VIENNA 
[London, February 1894] 
Cordial congratulations 341 from me too, dear Adelheid and Popp. Good 
examples are, as it were, raining round us thick and fast, and were I not so 
old and lame a horse, who knows—I might  still decide to go into harness 
again. 
Your old

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 6 March 1894  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
My dear Lafargue, 
I have just read Jaurès’ and Guesde’s  speeches on the corn tariffs. I must 
say Jaurès’ speech is astounding, and it seems to me regrettable that he was 
allowed to put forward his amendment in the name of the Party. 342 I don’t 
wish to speak of his proposal that the State should hold the price of corn at a 
minimum of 25 francs, which is out and out protectionism, and purely to the 
advantage of the big landowners into the bargain, since the small ones have 
no corn to sell, their produce not even sufficing for their own consumption. 
Guesde certainly said that, but after Léon Say, whereas we should have been 
the first to proclaim it loudly, instead of fol- 
=====第301页=====
Letters- 1894 275 
lowing in the footsteps of Mr Say. And it was Jaurès’ phrase-mongering 
which prevented us. 
But just take the proposal to make the State responsible for corn imports. 
Jaurès wants to prevent speculation. So what does he do? He makes the 
government responsible for the purchase of foreign corn. The government is 
the executive co mmittee of the majority in the Chamber, and the majority in 
the Chamber represents as fully as possible th ese very speculators in corn, in 
shares, in government stocks, etc. It’s like the last Chamber, where they 
made the Panamists responsible for the Panama investigation! And these 
Panamists, re-elected last August, are the people you want to make 
responsible for the suppression of speculation! It’s not enough for you that 
they rob France by means of the annual Budget and the Stock Exchange—
where at least they use their own cap ital and their own credit—you want to 
present them with several thousand milli ons and the national credit, so that 
they can clean out other people’s pockets more thoroughly by means of state 
socialism ! 
Further, Jaurès fancies he has made  an altogether new and unheard-of 
proposal. But the petty-bourgeois Socialists in the canton of Zurich got in 
first; for years past they have been asking for state monopoly in the corn 
trade; their state, I may say, is a great deal more  democratic than the French 
Republic, it can even treat itself to a chief of police who is a petty-bourgeois 
Socialist (Mr Vogelsanger) and knows nothing of omnipotent chief 
commissioners; and, besides, it is so small that it can afford many absurdities 
which mean nothing there, whereas a great nation cannot go in for such 
puerilities with impunity. 
Guesde’s speech naturally suffered by having to support, at least for the 
sake of appearances, some of Jaurès’ proposals. Fortunately his audience 
drew him into the field of general principles; that saved us; he was able to 
limit himself to touching lightly on Jaurès’ motion. Speaking for myself, I 
should have preferred to see Guesde make his formal contributions in-
dependently of Jaurès and as the m outhpiece of our group. However, he did 
what he could. 
All this is the upshot of the alliance with the ex-Radicals whom we are 
forced to endure.a In the first place, why did Jaurès make promises to the 
radical voters which he knew he could not keep? A radical custom, 86 but in 
no wise socialist and one that we should do well not to adopt.

Then your Mr Jaurès, this doctrinaire professor, who is nevertheless ignorant, 
above all, of political economy, and of e ssentially superficial talents, misuses 
his gift of the gab to push himself to  the fore and pose as the mouthpiece of 
socialism, which he does not so much as understand. Otherwise he would 
never have dared to put forward state socialism which represents one of the 
infantile diseases of proletarian socialism, a disease which they went through 
in Germany, for example, more than a dozen years ago, under the regime of 
the Anti-Socialist Laws, 15 when that was the only form tolerated by the 
government (and even protected by it). And even then only a negligible 
minority of the Party was caught in that snare for a short while; after the 
Wyden Congress 343 the whole thing petered out completely. 
Ah, yes, but we have a republic in France, the ex-Radicals will say to you; 
it’s quite another matter in our case, we can use the government to introduce 
socialist measures! A republic, in relation to the proletariat, differs from a 
monarchy only in that it is the ready-made political form for the future rule 
of the proletariat. You have the advantage of us in that it is already in being; 
we, for our part, shall have to waste 24 hours creating it. But a republic, like 
any other form of government, is determ ined by what composes it; so long as 
it is the form of bourgeois rule, it is quite as hostile to us as any monarchy 
whatsoever (save in the,  forms of that hostility). Hence it is a gratuitous 
illusion to treat it as an essentially socialist form; to entrust it, whilst it is 
dominated by the bourgeoisie, with socialist tasks. We can wring 
concessions from it, but never look to it to  carry out our job. Even if we were 
able to control it by a minority so strong that it could become a majority from 
one day to the next. 
However, what’s done can’t be undone . There will be other opportunities 
when our people will be able to come to the fore and proclaim their own 
tendencies, by means of Bills. 
So you were surprised by Louise’s marriage? It has been brewing for 
some months. Freyberger has left Vienna and given up a brilliant university 
career because they forbade him to enlighten the work ers, in his lectures, on 
the social causes of their ills. So he  came here, and he has found very good 
openings in the hospitals here. Once that was settled, there was no further 
reason for delaying the wedding. While waiting for his expectations to 
materialise he came to join his wife he re, you can see that it is an entirely 
matriarchal marriage, the husband is his wife’s boarder! 
That reminds me of my own matriarchal studies and the translation of

them that Laura was good enough to do. 195 I hope she approved of the few 
small alterations I suggested, and that you have told her how charmed I was 
by the translation of that 3rd and 4th part. I kiss her by your proxy.

Dear Sir, 
My reply to your esteemed letter of 26.2 has been somewhat delayed 344 by 
my absence from London. 333 
Things do not look ve ry bright so far as English socialist literature is 
concerned. The leading publisher of books of this nature is Sonnenschein 
(W. Swan Sonnenschein & Co., Paternoster Square). While there is a lot of 
inferior stuff amongst his SOCIAL SCIENCE SERIES, it also contains the 
following: 
W. Morris and E. B. Bax, Socialism, its Growth and Outcome;  
E. B. Bax, The Religion of Socialism; do., 
The Ethics of Socialism;  
Aveling, E. AND E. M[arx-Aveling], The Working Class Movement in 
America;  
Lafargue, The Evolution of Property;  
E. B. Bax, Outlooks from the New Standpoint;  
Hyndman, Commercial Panics of the 19th Century;  
=====第304页=====
278 Letters-1894  
Engels, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; do., 
Socialism, Scientific and Utopian  
etc. Again, the value of these things varies greatly. 
There is also a multitude of shorter propaganda pamphlets of very varied 
quality, some being really good, some  deplorably bad; none are easily 
obtainable through book shops. Most were published by the SOCIAL 
DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION 44 and the FABIAN SOCIETY. 43 
There is no journal similar to the Neue Zeit in this country. The socialist 
weeklies are: 
Justice (organ of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION), 
publisher H. Quelch, 37a, Clerkenwell Green, London, E. C. 
Workman’s Times, 59, Tile St., Manchester  (MANCHESTER LABOUR 
PRESS SOCIETY). 
That is about all the information I can give you. I fear, however, that the 
sort of Englishmen you meet in Wiesbaden will be unlikely to provide many 
suitable candidates for our party. 
Yours very truly,

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 
IN VIENNA 
London, 20 March 1894  
Dear Victor, 
A short while ago you asked me about translating the article in the Critica 
Sociale on the position, etc., of Italy. 334 Louise at once wrote a postcard on 
my behalf saying THAT YOU WERE WELCOME TO IT and I confirmed 
this a day or two later in a letter to you. 25 Soon afterwards an inquiry arrived 
from K. Kautsky who wanted to know if I 
=====第305页=====
Letters- 1894 279 
would let him have the thing for the Neue Zeit. In my reply I told him that 
you had already snaffled it.a 
But the article has not, in the meantime, appeared in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, 
and that puts me in an awkward position vis-à-vis K. Kautsky. So could you 
please let me know what is happening about it? I must say this makes me feel 
like the English landlady who, having on the one hand a nubile daughter and, 
on the other, a susceptible German lodger, demanded of the latter at the first 
sign of a flirtation: “WHAT AR E YOUR INTENTIONS WITH REGARD 
TO MY DAUGHTER?” But the fact that  K. Kautsky has entered into 
competition with you will doubtless exonerate me. 
Over here things are tending towards a general election 345 and everything 
that happens is done by way of preparation for it. The Liberals are as craven 
as ever. They must know that they  can only retain their position by 
increasing the political power of the workers and yet they hesitate and 
flounder about nervously. Neither a cut-and-dried extension of the suffrage, 
nor the elimination of a property qualification which consists in burdening 
the candidate with all the election expenses while failing to give him a 
salary, nor any provision in the shape of a second ballot for the putting up of 
a third candidate (alongside those of the two official parties). At the same 
time they want to abolish the house of lords but don’t lift a finger to produce 
a Lower House with the courage and ability to do this. The Tories for their 
part are making mistake after mistake. For two years they have been turning 
Parliament into a complete farce on the pretext of smashing HOME RULE; 
171 with the Liberals, who took this lying down, they have played, and 
continue to play, Old Harry, as Randy Churchill demonstrated last night, 346 
although, with elections in the offing, this is a risky business and might 
seriously shake the peace-loving [?]b British philistine’s faith in the 
Conservatives. Furthermore, Salisbury attempted to make the PARISH 
COUNCILS BILL 163 an occasion for playing a dirty trick on his Liberal 
Unionist allies, 206 Devonshire and Chamberlain,  and exploiting them for 
purely TORY ends, so that the said alliance is no longer as steadfast as 
heretofore. In short, things are getting into a frightful tangle, and at the 
moment it is difficult to guess what the outcome will be. 
My congratulations on the way you lulled the general strike to sleep

Dear Comrade, 
Owing to my absence from London 333 I have been prevented from an-
swering your letter of 24 February any earlier. This I duly received as well as 
the Manifestul comunist and Socialism utopic si socialism stüntifica for which 
very many thanks. Unfortunately I am not yet sufficiently versed in 
Romanian to be able to give an opinion on the merits of your translation. But 
I would caution you against taking the French translation as a basis when 
working on a German book. 
Unfortunately time does not permit me to comply with your request that I 
write a preface to the new edition. I am  busy putting the finishing touches to 
Volume II I of Marx’s Capital and, since printing is going rapidly ahead, I 
must devote all my time to the completion of the rest of the manuscript in 
order that no hold-ups should occur. 
With kindest regards,

122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Sorge, 
I have today sent back to you with many thanks The Holy Family by 
BOOK POST, REGISTERED, following its safe return from the trip to 
Rome.a 
Immediately after Easter I shall send you a parcel containing the Bax-
Morris bookb and Bernstein’s Berlin Complete Edition of Lassalle Works.c 
Auntie Motteler has just been here in company with Gertrud Liebknecht. 
Apparently the latter wants to move in temporarily with the former. What 
Liebknecht intends to do about her (s he says he wants her to go back) 
remains a secret—doubtless also to himself. His eldest daughter, Mrs Geiser, 
is living in the worst possible circumstances and his wife and Gertrud are at 
daggers drawn. I don’t in fact believe he has actually insisted that she return. 
Have you seen the novel Helena by old Mother Kautsky in the Vorwärts? 
She has peopled her stage with a crowd of living party members, including 
Motteler and his wife. It is a poor imitation of the popular novels of Gregor 
Samarowd (Spy Meding). I shall be interested to see whether it is passed over 
in silence and am somewhat surprised that the Vorwärts should have taken it. 
The paper’s feuilleton is censored by Mother Natalie Liebknecht. 
The Pionierkalender received with thanks. 
Over here the dissolution of Parlia ment draws on apace. At the new elec-
tions 345 more Labour candidates will be put  up than ever before, though not 
nearly enough, and I’m not sure whether a whole crowd of them won’t

again be put up with the help of TORY money. The Liberals, like the 
TORIES, are both of them firm supporters of the indirect property quali-
fication which consists in the candidate’s being burdened with the entire costs 
of the election—ranging from 4100 minimum up to between £400 and £600 
and even more for the official expenses alone, e.g. POLLING PLACES, etc. 
So if the working men fall into the clutches of Champion, who is offering 
4100 per constituency (he got the money from Hudson, the soap 
manufacturer), the Liberals will have no cause for complaint. All in all their 
approach to the elections is characterised by a curi ously obstinate refusal to 
face the facts. They act as t hough they wish to abolish the Upper House but 
refuse to remodel the Lower House (by increasing the power  of the workers) 
in such a way that it would be capable of tackling something of the kind on 
its own. The TORIES, on the other hand, are more stupid than they ever were 
and that is saying a good deal. For the past couple of years they have been 
playing Old Harry with the Liberal government in the Upper and the Lower 
House. To this the Liberals have calmly submitted, while the philistines, who 
have been turning Conservative in drove s, have rejoiced, since it was done on 
the pretext of removing the treasonable, anti-Empire HOME RULE BILL 171 
HOME RULE Government. Now, however, that serious domestic legislation 
is on the agenda, they are continuing to play the same game, and that might 
be rather too much of a good thing for your peace-loving philistine. So things 
remain very uncertain and the new elec tions will at all events produce some 
surprising results. Whatever happens, Labour will be strengthened and the 
Liberals will be compelled to make further concessions to the working man. 
In Austria, Belgium and Holland elector al reform has also been the order 
of the day. Before long there will be no European parliament without labour 
representatives. In Austria the cause is progressing very well. Adler is 
leading the movement with quite outstanding address and the Party 
Conference on Sunday  323 will also help. 
Once the tariff business 301 has to some extent been sorted out on your side 
of the Atlantic and the duty on raw materials been abolished, the crisis will 
probably recede and the superiority of Am erican industry over that of Europe 
will undoubtedly make itself fe lt. Only then will matters take a serious turn 
here in England, but then they will go with a bang.

and, since printing was rapidly forging ahead (twelve proof-sheets have 
already come back), I was compelled to make a brief announcement.a The 
final editing of the final third is not yet quite done, but next week I shall be 
getting down to it again. 
Louise Kautsky has told you of her marriage to Dr L. Freyberger from 
Vienna. He is a young physician who in my opinion has a major scientific 
career ahead of him. He is practising in hospitals here and has since moved 
in with us. Apart from the name, therefore, Louise’s address is unchanged.

trust your health has improved.

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 
IN VIENNA  
London, 22 March 1894  
Dear Victor, 
I wrote to you the day before yesterday, 13 and yesterday Louise wrote to 
you at the Kopernikusgasse by ‘registered’ mail. 
Your report on the state of affairs over there gave us great pleasure. Less 
so the prospect of your spending your summer holidays in ‘durance vile’, 349 
concerning which we had already seen something in the Arbeiter-

innen-Zeitung (as distinct from the Arbeiter-Zeitung). I wrote to you day 
before yesterday about  conditions over here. 350 
But the disappearance of our letters to you is really getting beyond a joke. 
After Louise had written to you yesterday we tried as best as we could to 
reconstruct from memory the letters she had written. These were as follows: 
1. In the middle of December she sent  Adelheid (Dworak) an article on 
Female Factory Inspectors,a along with various notes for the Arbeiter 
Zeitung —Adelheid has written to say that she never got the letter. 
2. Shortly before Christmas Louise wrote to you asking for some infor-
mation about the doctor you had recommended to Tussy. 
3. In January again to you asking  you, amongst other things, to convey 
my apologies to your wife and saying I was indisposed. 
4. Towards the end of January, when  Lafargue was here and Burns met 
him at our house, an account of the la tter’s visit and conditions in England 
generally—the letter was from Louise to you. 
5. In February she wrote to you urging you to use my article in the Critica 
Sociale. 334 
6 and 7. Two letters from her to you from Eastbourne between 9 February 
and 1 March. 
8. She wrote to Schacherl at the Arbeiter-Zeitung saying she was unable 
to send the articleb straight away. 
9. On 4 March she wrote asking you to send the Arbeiterinnen-Zeitung to 
Dr Bonnier, 19 Regent St, Oxford and also gave some information about 
Jaurès and the Socialist group in the French Chamber. 
Some of these letters were sent to  you at the editorial office of the 
Arbeiter-Zeitung, some to your private address and both lots seem to have 
been disappearing with equal regularity. On the other hand the rest of 
Louise’s letters to Vienna, including those to the gas-workers, have been 
arriving no less regularly, as have the replies. 
Your eight-page letter to Louise has likewise not arrived. 
So we shall now experiment for a time with registered letters. A cover 
address in Vienna might perhaps be a good idea.

ENGELS TO PABLO IGLESIAS 
IN MADRID 
[Draft] 
[London, 26 March, 1894] 
 
My dear friend Iglesias! 
I duly received your letter dated 24 N ovember, and I begin my reply by 
stating that this letter will be the last, if you persist in addressing me as 
‘usted’. Indeed, I have reason to feel offended by the fact that you refuse to 
address me in the manner customary among old members of the International 
and comrades-in-arms, the form of address which Anselmo Lorenzo, and 
many other comrades, old and younga accorded me as far back as 1872. So. 
let us please address each other as ‘tu’! 
I shall continue in French: I have not written in Spanish for more than 
twenty years now, and it would take me all day to write a letter in Spanish. 
Please forgive me!b 
Well now. I am very sorry that I missed the opportunity to see you in 
Zurich. 189 When I arrived at the Tonhallec on the Saturday morning, many 
friends came to talk with me in the restaurant before going in to 
a The following words are crossed out by Engels: ‘French, German, Austrian, Swiss and others’.

place of the Congress.

the meeting: I asked almost all of them to go and find the Spanish delegation, 
and to tell you that I was waiting for you; however, no one came. After the 
congress ended, I was told that I would certainly see you in the afternoon, on 
the steamboat. However, I looked for you in vain, and now I know what had 
happened. On the Sunday, no one was able to tell me where you were 
staying. I was told time and again that you had left, and I lost all hope of 
meeting you. I was extremely sorry, since one of the reasons, and not the 
least, why I came to Zurich was the hope of seeing my old friend Iglesias 
face to face and shaking his hand. 
Thank you for sending me regularly El Socialistae, which I read with great 
pleasure every Saturday evening, and from which I have the satisfaction of 
seeing that you are gradually spreadi ng across the whole of Spain, that 
socialism is being established on the ruins of Carlism 352 in the Basque 
countries, and that far away provinces of Galicia and Asturia are beginning to 
join the movement. Good luck! 
As for the anarchists, they are perhaps on the verge of killing themselves. 
This fever of violence, this volley of assassinations, senseless and, in the 
final analysis, paid for and incited by the police, cannot but open the eyes of 
the bourgeoisie to the nature of this propaganda of madmen and agents 
provocateurs. 353 Even the bourgeoisie will realise in the end that it is absurd 
to pay the police, and through the police the anarchists, to blow up the very 
bourgeois who pay them. And if now we also risk suffering from the 
bourgeois reaction, we shall benefit in the long run because this time we shall 
succeed in proving to everyone that th ere is a world of difference between 
ourselves and the anarchists. 
Over here the movement is progressing quite slowly. There is certainly a 
strong tendency towards socialism among the working masses. However, the 
historical conditions in England are such that this tendency in the masses 
produces, among the leaders, a host of different cross-currents which even 
fight against each other. Here, as in France, there will onl y be unity when 
there are some socialists in parliame nt. Today there are only two—which is 
one too many, or at least, too few. 
In Italy the situation is becoming critical and revolutionary. I am sending 
you the Critica Sociale with an article which I have written on the request of 
my friends from Milan. 334 
In Germany we are continuing as usual. It  is a well-organised and well-disciplined 
army which is growing every day, and which is advancing towards its goal with a 
sure and implacable step. In Germany we can 
=====第314页=====

almost calculate the day whena state power will fall into our hands. 
In the meantime, I draw your attention to Austria. There a great battle is in 
the making. The ruling classes, the fe udal nobility and the bourgeoisie, have 
exhausted their resources. An electoral reform is now inevitable. They are 
trying to arrange things so that the working class will not have too many 
representatives in parliament. But th e workers are determined, they are

from Vienna. I am most grateful to you for having sent it to me. 
The extent to which both science and events have progressed since the 
appearance in 1845 of that early work of minea—a work to which you accord 
such honourable mention but which in my view is much overrated—cannot 
be better demonstrated than by the plan you were able to draw up for the 
elaboration of your book. The very fact that it was possible to tackle such an 
inquiry, embracing as it does every detail, even those which seem least 
significant, that might have a bearing on the point at issue within the field of 
investigation, and this by a simple layman, is an enormous advance in itself. 
May you succeed in completing your wo rk exactly in acco rdance with your 
plan, thereby presenting us with a picture such as we have not possessed 
hitherto of the general situation of a large and highly interesting working-
class community. 
I am Sir, 
Yours faithfully,

Dear Comrade, 
I am very much obliged to you and the comrades of the S.D.F. 44 whose 
feelings you express for the honour you do me by asking me to lecture at 
your hall. But I am afraid I must d ecline. My work for our common cause 
lies in another branch of activity, where I believe I can be more useful,

and where I find full occupation for all the time at my command. Were I 
once to begin lecturing, at which trade moreover I am but a poor hand, I 
should no longer have a valid plea for re sisting other invitations, and then I 
should have entirely to give up my present class of work. For this reason I 
have regularly declined all sim ilar calls from the Fabian Society, 43 the I.L.P., 
114 and other bodies, with the exception made this year of the old Communist 
Verein,a where they claimed a fifty years’ hold upon me. 62 
But then, as far as the S.D.F. is c oncerned, there is another question to 
consider. You cannot but be aware that for years, up to a comparatively 
recent period, Justice, the official organ of the S.D.F., has been in the habit 
of charging me with all sorts of offences. These charges, mostly vague 
insinuations of mysterious crimes, Justice has never specified, never 
attempted to provide, and yet never withdrew.b

My dear Löhr, 
Your agreeable letter comes just in time. I was on the point of writing to 
Paul this morning, and so I have a good pretext of changing the address of 
my letter. I had just read your translation in the Ere Nouvelle and was quite 
charmed by it. 310 It reads better than th e original, there are only 
a Society - b Then there follows a number of unfinished and crossed out phrases which amount to 
the following: ‘I am therefore compelled to cons ider whether under these circumstances I do not 
owe it to myself for the present to refrain from presenting myself as a speaker in the hall of the 
S.D.F., And further, whether my appearance in th at capacity would not be unwelcome to a large 
portion, perhaps even a majority, of those to whom the hall belongs.’

two or three slight alterations I would suggest for a possible reprint. 
This leads me at once to the libertaire, alas not libertin! Dühring. 355 dear 
girl, vous avez fait vos preuvesa! You arrange yourself with Bonnet as most 
convenient. Provided the Manuscript passes through your hands, it’s all right 
and I will gladly look it over—w ithin the limits of my time, cela s’entend,b 
which limits I am sorry to say are very narrow and don’t look as if they were 
going to expand, on the contrary! 
But I do wish you could use your talents and energies for some other kind 
of work which, besides credit, would also bring cash into the pocket of the 
worker. Could no arrangement be made with Carré for something of that 
sort? 
I send you a No. of the Rheinische Zeitung, edited, as maybe you are 
aware, by the grand Karl Hirsch (since the 1st April). It is not, however, in 
order to give you a specimen of his elucubrations that I send it to you, but 
because it gives a report of the motion brought out in the Re ichstag by Count 
Kanitz, 356 one of the most shining lights amongst those Prussian Junkers who 
are, according to Hermann Wagener, their theoretical champion, either 
Ochsen von Geburt oder Ochsen aus Prinzip.c This motion, made in the 
interest of the landed aristocracy of Eastern Germany, is almost literally the 
proposition [made by] Jaurèsd which was to show the way to the socialist 
world how to use their parliamentary position in the interest of the working 
class and the peasantry. The same Count Kanitz has, the other day, 
proclaimed a new way to pay old debts, for the benefit of the German 
Empire: sell all your gold coin and repl ace it by about 4 milliards silver coin, 
which will leave 2 milliards clear prof it (silver being bought at 28 pence the 
ounce and being turned into money at 60 pence an ounce) wherewith to wipe 
out the Imperial debt. Now if I wanted to be malicious, I might ask M. Jaurès 
whether, in return for Kanitz’s accepta nce of his corn motion, he would not 
accept Kanitz’s silver motion which l ooks equally socialistic, and which, 
from an economic standpoint, is not a b it more objectionable. But I will be 
generous, even with Jaurès, and l eave him alone; our French comrades, 
however, I cannot refrain from observing,  ought really to look a little closer 
into the proposals of their ex-radical allies,e before they accept them 
blindfolded. A few more such escapades, and their reputation as political 
economists will be in great danger.

Dear Turati, 
I am sending you by post the Anglo-American edition {Discourse on Free 
Trade. 358 K. Marx) of your discourse, and the German translation of The 
Poverty of Philosophy, where you will find this speech in the appendix.a As for 
the French text, this is to be reprinted in the Paris L’Ère Nouvelle. 357 There is 
only one copy of the French text, namely mine, and if it is lost there will be 
no way to replace it. I therefore still do not know how to send it to Paris, for 
if I have a copy made here, this will mean loss of time, and I have too much 
experience of the post to entrust the original to it. 
The 2nd volume of Capital came but in Hamburg, published by Otto 
Meissner, as the 1st was, in 1893 (2nd edition). If I am not mistaken, the price 
is 6 marks. The same publishers are to issue the 3rd volume in September, to 
the great pleasure of the illustrious Achille Loria, a charlatan who warned 
everyone that Marx had never written this 3rd volume, but was always 
referring the reader to it simply to make a fool of him. 360

H. W. Lee. Secretary 
Social Democratic Federation 
 
Dear Comrade, 
Both you and the party who suggested to you the idea of my lecturing for 
you, 361 must have been aware that I have so far made it a rule not to lecture 
anywhere. But apart from that, I find myself in a peculiar position with 
regard to you, that is, if I rightly understand your letter, the Social 
Democratic Federation. 44 
You cannot ignore that for a long series of years and up to a comparatively 
recent period, Justice, the organ of the S.D.F., has constantly attacked me and 
brought all sorts of charges against me. While no attempt has ever been made 
to prove these charges, they have never been withdrawn. Nor has the S.D.F. 
ever disclaimed any responsibility for what Justice wrote. In consequence I 
have been compelled to keep entirel y aloof from the S.D.F. and do not see 
how I can change my attitude unless that difficulty is entirely removed. 
Yours faithfully,

Dear citizen, 
I have received your letter dated 20th of this month, but unfortunately I am 
quite unable to provide an article for the 1st May issue of your newspaper. 
To begin with, I am unwell at the moment. However, even if I were in the 
best of health, the urgent work that I am presently engaged in (the 
publication of the 3rd volume of Capital by Marx) and that I cannot lay aside 
makes it impossible for me to undertak e any other literary work. I have 
already warned those of our friends with whom I corresponded, and asked 
them to excuse me. You can well understand that I cannot now do for you 
that which I have officially refused to do for our friends in Spain, Austria and 
other countries. 
I wish your newspaper every success, and send my fraternal greetings to 
the editorial committee. 
Yours sincerely,

ENGELS TO CARL EBERLE 
IN BARREN 
London, 24 April 1894  
122 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Comrade, 
Your letter of 21 March arrived a day or two ago as did the album of 
Barmen you so very kindly sent me, and I should like to say how very 
grateful I am to the Social Democratic Club in Barmen and, in particular, to 
the compiler of the album, for this kind and for me both flattering and 
agreeable gift. Indeed it was an unexpect ed pleasure to be able to see the 
enormous changes that have taken pl ace in Barmen during the twenty years 
that I have been away. I feel completely  lost. Other than by the station and on 
one, the older, side of the Werther Bollwerk, I can no longer tell where I am 
from the pictures. Even the view taken on the Neuenweg, which surely 
cannot be more than a few minutes walk from the Bruch, is utterly strange to 
me. Only our old house remains unaltered. 
Though it is cheering to see these signs of an upheaval that has changed 
the Barmen of my youth from a small philistine backwater into a large 
industrial town, what nevertheless pleases me most is the fact that people 
there have also experienced a significan t change for the better. Had that not 
been the case, Barmen would even now be represented in the Reichstag by 
an out-and-out Conservative, some thoroughly sanctimonious ‘swell’, nor 
could there be any question of a Social Democratic Club in Barmen, while 
the last thing that would have occurred to Barmen’s working men would 
have been to honour me with an album. Fortunately, however, the revolution 
in the appearance of the town is attended by a revolution in the minds of its 
working men and for us that is a guarantee of a far mightier and more 
comprehensive revolution in the world as presently constituted. With sincere 
regards, 
Yours, 
F. Engels

Just two lines. 
Have the proofs of the Discours sur le libre échange 363 gone to Milan? If 
not, do please see that they are sent at once. Turati has published in the 
Critica Sociale a text which is a traductiona from the Russian of something 
made out of something in German, 364 and moreover so abbreviated that it is 
anything but Mohr. Now they threaten to publish this en brochure. And 
unless they get the French text soon, I shall not even be able to haul them 
over the coals for it, as th ey are doing ‘their text’ ! 
Surely it will be possible to make our French friends to treat business as 
business for once! 
Just come back from town  where we sent off the last of the Manuscript of 
Vol. II I,b 
If you get the Neue Welt with the Vorwärts or some other German paper, 
look at Aus finsteren Zeiten’c in No. 18. You will find there your grand-
parents and Mohr transmogrified into a romance and I wish you may relish 
it.

My dear Turati, 
I am returning to you, registered Post, the proofs of Libero Scambio, etc., 
together with the English edition, 358 which I would ask you to keep. The 
translation of my introduction is very good, except for a few points that are 
technically difficult—you will find the appropriate indications. However, 
Marx’s speech, which is published in the Critica Sociale, is not a translation 
but a summary 364 that I despair of setting in order. I have written again to 
Paris 25 to ask them to send you the Fren ch original. In the meantime please 
compare with the English text. If you publish the text according to Critica 
Sociale, you will receive complaints that this is not the author’s text, that this 
is to take liberties which are tantamount to forgery, etc., and unfortunately I 
will find it impossible to come to your aid, It would be better to rewrite it—it 
is not very long—than to expose oneself to such complaints.

advice I have again reached the stage at which the thi ng no longer bothers 
me at all, provided only that I don’t write too much by lamplight. 
Not long ago I caught a cold, which left me in no doubt that I am now an 
old man at last. On this occasion, what I had previously been able to treat as a 
minor annoyance, pretty well laid me low for a week and kept me under 
draconian medical supervision for a whole fortnight after that. Even now, I 
am expected to take care of myself for another fortnight, no less. It was a 
mild form of bronchitis which is not to be taken lightly in the case of the 
elderly, especially when, like myself, they have continued to tipple away 
merrily. Needless to say, I find this business of taking care of myself 
thoroughly distasteful, but Freyberger was, after all, quite right to prescribe it 
for me and, as to seeing that I carry it out, that is the province of Argus-eyed 
Louise who has doubled and tripled her vigilance. I think I have already 
written and told you a that we left our domestic arrangements as little 
changed as possible when we took in the young husband as a boards and 
lodger. All very nice and jolly, it is true, but only, alas, so long as one is in 
good health. Never in my born days have I been so plagued with medical 
attention as during this past month and I can only console myself with the 
thought that it was all done for my own good. 
Dietzgen and wife were here for an hour or two on Sunday afternoon but 
unfortunately missed Tussy. I have given him recommendations to Bebel 
and Kautsky. They were very nice people. 
I hope that your sonb has since found a situation. With his knowledge of 
business, and having by now doubtless rid himself of a good many illusions 
as a result of practical experience, a bright young man like that should 
always fall on his feet in America. 
Things are little changed over here. There is no chance of achieving any 
kind of unity amongst the labour leaders. But the masses are nevertheless 
moving ahead, Slowly it is true, and only now striving to acquire 
consciousness, yet the process is unmistakeable. It will be the same here as 
in France and, before that, in German y: Unification will be forced upon them 
as soon as a number of independent wo rking men (especially those who have 
been elected without the help of the Liberals) secure seats in Parliament. 
This the Liberals are doing their utmost to prevent. They are not 1. extending 
the franchise to the people who— on paper —already have it, but are, on the 
contrary, 2. ensuring that the registers of electors

will involve the candidates in greater expense than hitherto, since they are 
now to be compiled twice a y ear, the cost of compiling a correct register 
being borne by the candidates or the representatives of the political parties 
and not by the state. They have categor ically rejected the principle of 3. 
electoral expenses being borne by the state or the municipality, also 4. of 
parliamentary salaries and 5. of second ballots. The retention of all these old 
abuses amounts to the outright disqualification of the labour candidates in at 
least three-quarters of the constituencies. Parliament is to remain a rich man’s 
club. And this at a time when the rich, b ecause content with the status quo, 
are all turning Conservative, while the Liberal Party is slowly dying, and 
becoming ever more dependent on the Labour vote. The Liberals, however, 
insist that the working man should only vote for a bourgeois and not for a 
working man, let alone an independent working man. 
This will be the undoing of the Libe rals. Their lack of courage is 
alienating the country’s Labour voters, dissipating their small majority in 
Parliament, and, unless they make some very bold moves at the eleventh 
hour, they will probably be done for. Th ereupon the Tories will take the helm 
and carry out what the Liberals intended—not merely to promise—actually 
to do. And in that case an independent  Labour party is pretty well assured. 
The Social Democratic Federation 44 over here and your German-
American Socialists 367 share the distinction of being the only parties that 
have contrived to reduce Marx’s theory of development to a rigid orthodoxy 
which the working man is not expected to arrive at by virtue of his own class 
consciousness; rather it is to be promptly and without preparation rammed 
down his throat as an article of faith. Hence they have both remained mere 
sects, having come, as Hegel puts it, from nothing by way of nothing to 
nothing.a I have not yet had time to read Schlüter’s controversy with your 
Germans, but shall tackle it tomorrow. Judging by the Volkszeitung’s earlier 
articles, it would seem that th e right note has been struck. 
Give my warm regards to your wife  and let us have some better news

Dear Sir, 
I note from your letter of the 10th inst. that you have made and already 
sent to the printers a Russian translation of my works on Russia which 
recently appeared in Berlin , just as you did previous ly in the case of other 
writings by Marx and myself. 368 
I must needs draw your attention to the fact that, in accordance with the 
Berne Convention 303 Introduction to Wage Labour and Capital by Marx 
(1891) as well as the above-mentioned works are my literary property and 
that translations of them into foreign languages may not be published in the 
countries of the Union without my permission. Even though the matter of 
fees may play only a subordinate or no role at all in cases such as these, or 
where genuine party undertakings are c oncerned, I am nevertheless obliged 
to assert my rights in the interests of the cause, for otherwise it would mean 
my assuming joint responsibility for th e publication of translations by 
unqualified or otherwise incompetent persons. And since I have already 
committed myself to a third party, I am under a twofold obligation. 
So far as I am aware, it has hitherto been customary in th e party, even in 
the case of translations of works unprotected by the Berne Convention, to 
show consideration for the writer by applying to him for authorisation. First Russian Edition, Vol.

When, however, a work falls within the terms of the Berne Convention, this 
is not simply a polite formality but the translator’s bounden duty. You have 
chosen to ignore this. I hereby protes t against your conduct and reserve all 
my rights. 
My objection to the publication of an unauthorised Russian translation of 
my works on Russia from Internationales aus dem ‘Volksstaat’ is all the 
greater in that I have already made ove r the translation rights in the Russian 
language for these and other works, namely to Mrs Vera Zasulich. 
This disposes once and for all with your inquiry rega rding my preface.

ENGELS TO GEORGI PLEKHANOV 369 
IN MORNEX (France) 
London, 21 May, 1894 
 
My dear Plekhanov, 
First of all, please spare me ‘mentor’—my name is simply Engels. 
Next, thank you for your information. I have sent a registered letter to M. 
Krichevsky to say that the introduction to Wage Labour and Capital,a and 
also the articles on Russia in Articles on International Themes from the 
Newspaper ‘Volksstaat’ 370 are, according to the Berne Convention, 303 my 
literary property, and that any translation requires my consent; that I am 
obliged, in the interests of the cause, to stand upon my rights in order to 
prevent translations by incapab le or otherwise incompetentb (or

unauthorised) individuals; that therefore it was simply his duty to request my 
permission beforehand, which he did not do; that as a result I would enter a 
formal protest against his actions, and reserve all my rights; that, as regards 
the articles on Russia, I protested all the more since I had already committed 
myself, having granted authorisation for a Russian translation of these and 
other works to Madame Vera Zasulich. 
If he now persists in publishing, we shall see; in any case, please let me 
know if it appears, and send me a copy. 
As he also announces a translation of Kautsky’s Erfurt Programme,a I felt 
obliged to warn the latter of the methods being used in my regard. 25 I told 
him nothing of what you wrote to me, but I told him that dishonesty was 
involved, and that he should get in touch with you to learn more. 
I hoped to see Mendelson yesterday evening,  but I hear that his wife is ill. 
If I can, I shall go to see him this week. 
Thank you in advance for the copy of your Chernyshevsky.b I await it 
impatiently. 
Here things are moving, albeit slowly and in zigzags. Take, for example, 
Mawdsley, the leader of the Lancashire textile workers. He is a Tory, a 
conservative in politics, and a pious believer in religion. Three years ago, 
these people were furious over the 8 hours day, and now they themselves 
insist on it. In a recent manifesto, Ma wdsley, who a year ago was a vehement 
opponent of any separate politics by the working class, declares that the 
textile workers should think about direct  representation in parliament, and a 
workers’ newspaper in Manchester calculates that the textile workers in the 
county of Lancashire alone would control twelve seats in parliament. You 
will see: it is the trade-unions that will enter parliament; it is not the class but 
the branch of industry which is asking to be represented. But that is also a 
step forward. First let us break the subordination of the workers to the two 
large bourgeois parties by having tex tile workers in parliament, as we 
already have miners. When there are a dozen branches of industry 
represented, class consciousness will explode of its own accord. 
To complete the comedy, in this same manifesto Mawdsley requests bi-
metallism 299 in order to preserve the supremacy of English cotton fabrics on 
the Indian market!

One can only despair at these English workers with their sense of imag-
inary national superiority, their esse ntially bourgeois ideas and opinions, 
their narrow ‘practical’ viewpoint, and the rampant parliamentary corruption 
which has infected their leaders. Yet things are moving nonetheless. Only the 
‘practical’ English will arrive the last, but when they arrive, they will put a 
very heavy weight on the scales.

My dear Mendelson, 
I have received a long letter from Geor gi Plekhanov which contains many 
things with regard to you and the Polish movement. I intended to read it to 
you last Sunday, but I have learne d that Mme Mendelson was taken ill and 
that therefore you had to stay at home. If this be convenient to you, I shall 
come to see you the day after tomorrow, Thursday, from 2 to 2.30 in the 
afternoon, together with Mme Freyberger, who would like to see how Mme 
Mendelson is feeling.

My dear Plekhanov, 
Yesterday, shortly after my letter to you had left, Bernstein and Kautsky 
arrived at my house. That has inevitably changed my plans. I thought that I 
ought—even without waiting for your express permission—to read them 
your letter, and put them both in a position to judge for themselves of the 
Krichevsky business. The impression this created on them will, I believe, be 
everything you could have desired. Indeed, however much one might wish to 
remain neutral in issues and disputes within the Russian emigre community, 
one cannot excuse the behaviour of Kric hevsky as regards the translation of 
the Soziales aus Russland 368 after learning about the translation undertaken 
by Vera Zasulich.a As for the rest, these gentlemen knew Karl Kautsky had 
given his consent to the translation of his Erfurt Programmeb; however, he 
thought that it was to be printed in Russia, or at least, he had not the slightest 
idea that it would be published in Switzerland. 
Ignatievc is, so Kautsky told me, the pseudonym of Helfond (or some 
name similar to that), who is in Stuttgart. You probably know him. However, 
as I do not have Kautsky’s authorisation to use this information, I would ask 
you to treat it as strictly confidential. According to Kautsky and Bernstein, it 
would seem that Helfond is an honourable fellow who has fallen into 
Jogiches’ trap by accident ra ther than malicious intent.

ENGELS TO BORIS KRICHEVSKY 
IN WEGGIS 
[Draft]  
London, 31 May 1894 
 Dr B. Krichevsky, Weggisa 
You have my permission to sell off the copies already in print of your 
Russian edition of Wage Labour and Capital along with my introduction, 
and I note with satisfaction that y ou will refrain from publishing my other 
works. 368 
Apart from that, I thank you for your letter of the 25th which I look upon as 
a most valuable contribution to the characterisation of certain trends amongst 
the Russian émigrés. Any inclination I might have to discuss its contents is 
tempered by the consideration that you yourself probably do not expect to 
impress anybody with these time-worn catchphrases à la Nechayev, since 
you yourself are doubtless aware how ludicrous it is to seek to act the Social 
Democrat while behaving like an anarchist. 
But when you say ‘that we could have had no inkling that you had already 
made over the translation rights to someone else’, you might really have 
spared yourself that downright falsehood. You knew long before you wrote 
your letter of the 10th of May that V. Zasulich and Plekhanov were preparing 
a Russian translation of ‘On Social Re lations in Russia’. In view of the 
character of these people and the friendly relationship I have enjoyed with 
them for many years, it goes without saying that they would

ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 
IN ST. PETERSBURG 
London, 1 June 1894 
 
My dear Sir, 
Last week I forwarded to you sheets 7 to 16 incl. of Vol. II P and hope 
you have received them. They were registered, and my name as sender at the 
back (L. K.b). 371 
I am glad to learn of the success of the ‘Essays’.c I hope a new edition is in the 
press. I should be very glad if I could find a German translator for the book, 
unfortunately most of the translation work from Russian into German is done 
by ladies, generally not well prepared for economic work. 
With many thanks I received the Russian ‘Origin’ etc., 372 the translation, 
as far as I have read, seems to me very well done, and on the whole the 
censorship seems to have dealt leniently with the book. 
The sheets were sent rather late, but it was the fault of the publisher who 
delayed them a long time. It is very hard work reading the proofsheets of a 
book like this. You will find in the sheet s sent the solution of the question 
how the different rates of surplus value are equalised into one and the same 
average rate of profits, the law of the tendency of that rate of profits 
constantly to fall, and the mode in which commercial capital participates in 
the distribution of surplus value. This comes to a conclusion in Sheet 
a of Capital- b Louise Kautsky - c Nikolai-on. [Danielson], Outlines of our Post-Reform National 
Economy, 1893 [title in Russian]  
=====第335页=====
Letters- 1894 309 
21, in which the 5th Section opens: the splitting up of profits into interest and 
‘profits of enterprise’ (Zins und Unternehmergewinn), moneyed capital 
generally, banking and credit. This section fills up a whole third of the book; 
it has cost me more trouble than all the rest. — The last third consists of 
section VI: Rent of Land, and VII : the three kinds of revenue: Rent, profits 
(interest), wages. 
The last of the Manuscript is in the printer’s hands. But I only now find 
what an enormous amount of arrears of work I have on my hands, as 
everything not absolutely necessary had to be put back in order to finish Vol. 
3rd. This must be my excuse if I do not now recur to some of the economic 
questions previously discussed between  us. As it is, I think we both have 
plenty of work on our hands and better leave that discussion for another time. 
Yours very sincerely 
L. K. 
The volumes on industrial and agricultural development of Russia 
(Chicago Exhibition) 373 have reached me. Please accept my hearty thanks. 
They are very useful indeed, especia lly when compared with the ‘Essays’.

relief! But the proof-sheets are giving me a rough time; they need close, 
unremitting attention, it’s wearisome!  And Meissner employs a rather 
careless printer, which makes my job twice as hard. Add to this that Dietz is 
printing the 3rd edition of my Anti-Dühring and you can take my word for it 
when I say that I am literally overwhelmed by proof-sheets. 
Your description of fashionable socialism in France gave me a good 
laugh. But it could turn out to be a serious matter. If you had a strong, steady 
army like the two million German voter s, well and good; that would control 
the heterogeneous mass of newcomers. But with a Party split into Marxists, 
Blanquists, 20 Allemanists, 21 Broussists 30, and several other ists, not to 
mention the ex-Radicals 86 of the Millerand stamp who boss all the others in 
the Chamber, it is very hard to say where this new fashion is going to lead 
you. You compare it to Boulangism 6: Boulangism, after a few months’ 
spree, ended in the mire and in ignominy. In a movement of this kind it is 
pretty well certain that phrase-mongers like Jaurès, who already arrogate to 
themselves the sole right to speak for you all in the Chamber, will boss 
things. 
Today they have the ear of the H ouse where they silence our people, 
tomorrow they will have the ear of the nation. 
It is always on the cards that the whole thing will not turn out too badly, 
and even well; but, in the meantime,  you will go through some curious 
experiences, and I am glad for us all th at there is a solid  combat corps in 
Germany whose actions will decide the battle. This socialist mania which is 
emerging in your country may lead to a decisive struggle in which you will 
win the first victories; the revolutionary traditions of the country and of the 
capital, the character of your army, reorganised since 1870 on a far more 
popular basis—all this makes such an eventuality possible.  But to ensure 
victory, to destroy the foundations of  capitalist society, you will need the 
active support of a much stronger, more numerous, more tried and more 
conscious socialist party than you have at your command. It would mean the 
achievement of what we have foreseen and predicted for many years. The 
French give the signal, open fire, and the Germans decide the battle. 
In the meantime, we are nowhere near that and I am very curious to see 
how the confused enthusiasm su rrounding you will resolve itself. 
Even Carl Hirsch  noted in the Rheinische Zeitung that behind all this noise 
over Turpin 374 there are but bourse speculators. It is only the English press 
that is forbidden to say this and consequently, it pretends to see in that an 
affair of high and low politics. Here one is sure that behind 
=====第337页=====
Letters- 1894 311 
any great political affair there must be the bourse and the smart operators, 
and this is why it is strictly forbidden to speak of that. Protestant bourgeois 
hypocrisy! Look at Jabez Balfour and at Mundella who has just resigned 
from his ministry and for good reason; look at Sir J. Ferguson and Sir J. 
Gorst, who are also implicated and who probably have made themselves 
ineligible for any future Tory ministry. 375 
The other day Kautsky came to us—he has been four times to us. Louise 
and her husband received him in the mo st amiable manner; if someone was 
embarrassed, it was not they. 
As to your medallion (that is to say, mine), this will make difficulties. 
Once I was foolish enough to have myself photographed in profile, but this 
will never happen to me again. I have su ch a foolish look that I would rather 
not have my portrait in profile go dow n to posterity. However, I would be 
pleased to see the medallion of Marx (s end it also for Tussy, please!), and I 
am quite curious if your artist has succeeded in reproducing the nose which, 
in profile, has really impossible lines. 
Kiss Laura on my behalf!

2. Externalisation of the Relations of Capital in the Form of Interest-
Bearing Capital (Chap. XXIV), 
I shall gladly place them at your dis posal. Their content lends itself very 
well to this type of publication, while at the same time they do not contain 
any of the major solutions which should only appear in context and, for that 
very reason, should be reserved for publication in toto. No. 2 contains 
amongst other things the story of Dr Price, Mr Pitt, and the compound 
interest hocus-pocusb. If you would like to have them, I shall delete such 
notes, etc., as are not required from the first proof-sheets and send them to 
you as soon as I have got the revises, in about eight or sixteen days’ time. 
I have also routed out the old article von den letzten Dingenc which I am at 
last licking into shape for you (I resume after having been interrupted for two 
and a half hours by Liebknecht and Julius,d who have just left), but am 
changing it and giving it a different titlee; since the time I began it I have

Christianity.

Dear Baron, 
Marx’s two chapters’ 5 despatched by registered mail at the same time as 
this. You might entitle them: ‘From Book II I of Capital by K. Marx’—I and 
II , and indicate in a note that these are Chapters XXII I and XXIV, taken

Interest-bearing Capital’. The titles of th e chapters must be retained in each 
case. In order to simplify things I have deleted the Greek, also all the notes

and we are having a heat-wave. 
Thank you for the bit of the Volksanwalt. As regards the thing from the 
Critica Sociale, 334 Victor has really been leading me up the garden path. 
After I had agreed to let him have it, he simply dropped the thing altogether 
and now proposes to await the moment when it ‘becomes topical’ again. 
Next time I shall be more wary; he treats his contributors in a very odd way. 
Well, I look forward keenly to seeing wh at the fate of your daily will be. 377 
Not, I hope, that of Guesde’s and Lafargue’s Socialiste quotidien ‘pour 
paraître en octobre’ ; 280 only yesterday we were chaffing poor Bonnier 
about it when he passed this way. 
So Carnot has been stabbed to death. A poor, stupid, boring fellow—the 
first Frenchman to rise to the top through being a bore—and in France too! 
But now Alexander II I will repudiate the French alliance. ‘Merci,’ he will 
say, ‘there’s plenty of that sort of thing to be had at home and at less 
expense!’ Incidentally, there might be  a certain element of vengeance for 
Aiguesmortes in this. 378 I shall be curious to see how the sixty self-styled 
‘Socialists’ in the Chamber will now behave.a That the affair will be 
exploited à la Hödel there can be no doubt, but on the other hand the sixty 
will weigh heavily in the scales at the presidential elections next

reticence vis-à-vis his colleagues. 380 Needless to say, it would never occur to 
me to ask of these, Mr Oberwinder’s colleagues—as to whose good faith I

was perfectly adequate and it is puerile, anarchistic casuistry to describe it as 
information at third hand.

were counting on my bowing to a fait accompli. You were totally mistaken,

present state of development both of the European and of the Russian

ers’ hands, I am once again able to turn my attention to your affairs, 199 and 
can let you have the much delayed reply to your note of 25.4. 
There are certain snags about the continuation of Carl’s major work, 
brought out by the Vieweg Verlag, and this also applies to all the rest of his 
other stuff held by that firm. When I went down to Manchester I took a look 
at the contracts which stipulate that if, for instance, Carl were to die before 
completion of the whole, Vieweg might have the work completed by a person 
of his own choosing. This is the reason for his silence and also for his failure 
to publish the work left behind by Carl; he obviously wishes to retain a 
completely free hand. Nor can he be expected to pay any further royalties. 
For 1. by the terms of the contract, he will pay only for mos. that are ready 
for press, i.e. no unfinished stuff, and 2. will pay no royalties in respect of 
new editions to which no changes have been made.  
In short, Vieweg can do exactly as he likes and will, if he is to bring out 
Vol. V, in any case have to find another author for the German edition. 311 
As regards Carl’s work on the history of chemistry, Siebold has written to 
tell me that, because of constant illness,  he has not yet been able to prepare 
the ms. for press, nor has he yet completed his English translation. 313 The 
poor devil has had rotten luck with his health, his nerves being again in a very 
poor state, and will need a long rest and plen ty of fresh air if he is to recover. 
As far as money matters are concerned th ere is no need for you to worry; they 
are in good hands and, as things are now, Roscoe is also in control of this 
aspect so that ultimately one must content oneself with the particulars he 
supplies in respect of payments made for work such as revision, etc. It is 
possible that Roscoe’s task has been made somewhat easier by his having 
dealt with Siebold direct instead of with myself as promised, but it won’t 
make much difference since I should in any case have had to refer him to 
Siebold and Klepsch in respect of all se ttlements and should, in the end, have 
had to make do with his assurances. A vital factor here is that, with the rapid 
advances made in chemistry, any textbook becomes out of date within a year 
unless constantly revised and thus, where this sort of literature is concerned, 
only a living author can keep his end up vis-à-vis either publishers or readers. 
I had hoped I might again visit Germany this summer but shall not be able

matters connected with my lease I must remain in the vicinity of London so 
as to be able to return there at any moment should need

ENGELS TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEUE ZEIT  
IN STUTTGART 
[London,] 9 July 1894 
At the request of Mr K. Kautsky and in reply to his inquiry from Hirsau on 
7.7.94, I beg to inform you that Chapter of Das Kapital, p. 359, lines 9 and 
10 from the top, should read: ‘Welchen Rohprofit es ihm als fungierendes —
Kapital... abwirft’ [‘what gross profit it yields to him as functioning capital’.] 
Likewise, on p. 368, line 3 from the top, the expression fungierendes 
Kapital’ [‘functioning capital’] is correct. 
Further, on p. 363, line 14 from the top, a comma may, in fact, be inserted 
after desselben [‘of it’] in the sentence: ‘in Form von denen das gesamte 
Kapital, abgesehen von dem in Ge ld existierenden relativ kleinen

Teil desselben, vorhanden ist’ [‘which make up the total capital outside of a 
relatively small portion of it, existing in money’], as this brings out the 
meaning better. 381 
I am very pleased about the discovery of the printing error on P. 359, 
namely fungierendem in place of  fungierendes, for which kindly convey my 
best thanks to K. Kautsky, 
Yours very faithfully,

Dear Baron, 
My article on early Christianity 1 goes off by registered mail today to the 
Editor, Neue Zeit, Furthbachatr. 12, as does this letter, since I have not got 
your exact address in Hirsau and do not know how long y ou will be staying 
there. 
Since the ms. is barely legible and contains many corrections, I should be 
glad if you could send me the galley proofs. No doubt minor amendments 
and additions would be admissible in the case of such comprehensive 
material. 
There was indeed a slip of the pen in the passage from Das Kapital, 
Chapter 23, and you did me a real service in pointing it out.b 
Because of sundry business matters I cannot go away at the moment. At

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 
IN VIENNA 
London, 17 July 1894  
Dear Victor, 
I am glad that those few marks should have arrived so opportunely and 
trust you will use them to treat yourself to the rest and recuperation out in the 
country which are so absolutely essential to you. You simply must go away; 
what you need more than anything else is to recover from the wear and tear 
of your time in prison. 349 You yourself say you feel done in and that, if truth 
be told, is not surprising, so the moment you are released, out into the 
country with you! This would also be the best way of ensuring your wife’s 
complete recovery. 
The additional chapter (it is only the enlargement of an  already extant 
one) in Anti-Dühring is by Marx, so the only work I had to do on it consisted 
in copying and editing. 382 
About 36 sheets of Volume II P have been set up and there will probably 
be more than 50 all told. Since it is wholly in Meissner’s interest to get the 
thing out by September, it will doubtless be ready by then. 
I wish your daily paper well and am already looking forward to seeing it.

‘how things are done’. The chaps can hardly fail to follow it. However, when 
you are in jug, one sometim es becomes aware that the Arbeiter Zeitung, too, 
has men who are unsuitable and who push themselves to the fore where they 
have no business to be. But once the daily is in existence, your activities as a 
speaker will automatically  be confined to a few occasions of crucial 
importance, and this will mean your spending less time in jug, while a 
dummy editor is in any case indispensable to the paper as such, if only as the 
sacrificial lamb who takes upon himself the sins of the editorial department. 
And again, in Vienna, you have just now a soil more favourable to a daily 
than that proffered by Berlin. The po litical movement to which you belong is 
in the ascendant; you are assured of getting electoral reform 270 and the very 
fact of fighting for a goal such as this, for an immediate political advance is 
of tremendous advantage to your paper. Electoral reform, however, is no 
more than the impulse that will set th e ball rolling and will necessarily entail 
other concessions relating to the press, association, assembly, legal practices, 
etc. In short, you are engaged in an offensive and one, which, to begin with at 
any rate, is assured of victory. In France, Germany and Italy, on the other 
hand, our people are engaged in what is a by no means always promising 
defensive action and have to withstand the onslaught of a reaction constantly 
reinforced by the adherence of the most disparate parties. It is proof that—in 
Germany, at least,—our people have really become a power in the land, 
while in France, a country riddled with revolution, it is proof that our people 
are at least looked upon as a power. But none the less you are, at the moment, 
in a better position to fight—you are attacking, gaining ground step by step, 
and every fresh bit of ground you seize and occupy not only strengthens your 
position but brings you vast numbers of fresh reinforcements. Your primitive 
constitutionalism is such that there are still at least a few positions for the 
workers to capture, and by lawful mean s at that, i.e. m eans whereby they 
themselves will be politically educated—positions which ought to have been 
captured by the bourgeoisie. In our c ountry, too, there are still positions of 
this kind to be taken, but these we shall only get if the impulse comes from 
without, from a country where the amalgamation of the old forms—
feudalism, bureaucracy and police—with more or less modern, civil 
institutions, has given such prepondera nce to the first as to produce a 
situation of impossible complexity. And that is the happy state in which you 
find yourselves, not to mention the even hap-

pier one of having a workers’ movement big enough and strong enough to 
bring things to a head and thus, I hope, provide the impulse required by 
Germany, France and Italy if they ar e temporarily to disrupt the far too 
premature formation of the ‘one reactionary mass’, 214 and replace chronic 
reactionary oppression with a number of civil reforms such as freedom of 
movement for the masses. Not until y ou have fought for and won electoral 
reform—of no matter what kind—not until then will the agitation against the 
three-class electoral system in Prussia 291 have any significance.  And even 
now the fact that there is going  to be some  sort of electoral reform in Austria 
has already averted the threat that hung over universal suffrage in Germany. 
So at this moment you people have a very important historical mission. It is 
you who will constitute the vanguard of th e European proletariat, and initiate 
the general offensive which we can onl y hope will not falter again before we 
achieve victory all along the line—and it is you yourself who will be leading 
that vanguard; so unless you go out into the country forthwith and thoroughly 
recoup your strength, you will be neglecting what is  your foremost duty. 
And how serious that duty is becomes all the more apparent when you 
reflect that the only rivals whom you might have as a vanguard are the 
French. You wrote and told Louise that you would like me to report on the 
latter. I have put it off until today becau se 1. last week Tussy returned from 
the Glassworkers’ Congress in Paris and 2. Bonnier came to see us the day 
before yesterday and I wanted to hear their side of the story first. W ELL, SO 
far as I can see, the position is this: 
The last elections 208 brought some twenty-five ‘Socialists’—Marxists, 
Broussists, 30 Allemanists, 21 Blanquists 20 and Independents—into the 
Chamber. At the same time they elim inated what had h itherto been the 
‘Radical group’, also describing itself as républicains socialistes, 86 notably 
by excluding all its former leaders. Thereupon some thirty members of that 
group, who had been re-elected, combin ed under the leadership of Millerand 
and Jaures and suggested that they and the ‘Socialists’, should join forces. 169 
It was a very safe move on their part  for not only were they more numerous 
then the old Socialists, they were also united whereas the latter were 
fragmented into umpteen groups. In this way they once more formed in the 
Chamber a respectable group some fifty or sixty strong without having to 
offer the old Socialists anything more than a highly platonic socialist 
programme, the politically radical articles of which had already formed part 
of their earlier programme as had their general pro- 
=====第351页=====
Letters- 1894 325 
working class attitude, while the socialisation des moyens de productiona still 
remained an innocent ch imera which might perhaps acquire practical 
significance three or four generations hence, but certainly not any sooner. 
Our twenty-five old Socialists seized on the opportunity with both hands. 
They were not in a position to lay down conditions, being far too disunited 
for that. The intention was, it is true, that they should act in concert in the 
Chamber, as during the elections, but that, for the rest, all the separate 
organisations should continue to exis t alongside one another; indeed, an 
attempt on the part of any one group to  lay down specific conditions for the 
new Socialists would have brought it into conflict with the others. For that 
matter, they would not have been Frenchmen, had not the immediate 
prospect of swelling their numbers in the Chamber from twenty-five to fifty-
five or sixty filled them with enthusiasm, and had not present victory, or a 
semblance thereof, blinded them to the dangers that lay ahead. Damn it all, 
aren’t the Germans for ever crowing about their forty-four deputies? And at 
one fell swoop we’ve got fifty-five if not sixty! La France reprend sa place à 
la tête du mouvement!c 
The thirty or thirty-five new Socialists have entered into a marriage of 
convenience with Socialism. They would just as soon not have done so, but 
taking the plunge was the shrewdest thing for them to do. Having realised 
that they would not, after all, be able to carry on without the workers, they 
have had to ally themselves with the latter for better or for worse. But for no-
one was that alliance an altogether voluntary affair at first, as it certainly still 
is not for many today. 
Of its leading representatives, Millerand is the shrewdest and, I believe, 
the most sincere, but I fear that some of his bourgeois-legal prejudices are 
more deep-seated than he himself realises. Politically he is the most capable 
of the whole bunch. Jaurès is an acad emic and doctrinaire who enjoys the 
sound of his own voice and whose voice the Chamber enjoys listening to 
more than to that of Guesde or Vaillant  because he is more closely akin to 
the gentlemen of the majority. I believe it is his sincere intention to turn 
himself into a decent Socialist but, as  you know, the zeal of such neophytes 
is in direct relation to their lack of practical knowledge which, in the case of 
Jaurès, is very great. Which explains how it was that 
a the socialisation of the means of production - b France will once more resume her place at the 
head of the movement.  
=====第352页=====
326 Letters- 1894 
in Paris Jaures tabled as socialist the self-same motion as that put forward in 
Berlin by Count Kanitz in the interest of the Junkers—the nationalisation of 
the import of grain with a view to raising the price of corn. 356 And since the 
old Socialists in the Chamber evince a lack of practical knowledge in 
oeconomicisa hardly less extreme—Lafargue’s defeat at Lille means there is 
no one on the spot who knows anything about the subject—Guesde could not 
abstain from supporting at least part of the motion as ‘socialist’ and directed 
against ‘speculation’. To propose to do away with ‘speculation’ by handing 
over the grain trade to a government and a government party consisting of 
Panamite confidence tricksters 60 is indeed a splendidly socialist idea. I have, 
through Bonnier and Lafargue, conveye d to the gentlemen concerned my 
unvarnished opinion of this colossal blunder. 
I further told them that, though fusion ra ther than a mere alliance with the 
new Socialists might be their inevitable fate, they should bear in mind the 
possibility of there being bourgeois elem ents amongst the latter and that this 
might involve them in a conflict over principles, in which case a split might 
become inevitable. They must, I went on, prepare for this so that in the event 
the transition to a simple alliance c ould proceed smoothly and not surprise 
them into making blunders. Above all, should the chaps in the joint group 
put forward anything they felt unable to endorse and they be outvoted, they 
should repudiate any obligation to take the floor in the Chamber in support 
of such measures, but rather reserve the right to justify their adverse opinion 
in their press even if, for the sake of unity, they had had to vote in favour of 
the said measures. 
Well, we shall have to see if it does any good. 
Thus, on the one hand there are the new Socialists who are imposing a 
certain unity on the most disparate groups of old Socialists. On the other, our 
chaps abroad, who find it puzzling that a group of some sixty men should 
suddenly have appeared ‘out of thin air’ and that its chief spokesmen, 
Millerand and Jaurès, should not hitherto  have been known to be Socialists; 
hence the very natural doubts as to the authenticity of the aforementioned 
sixty, particularly after the brilliant impression left behind in Zurich by the 
French delegates. 250 
Beneath the surface, the intrigues and mu tual recriminations of the various 
sects continue unchecked. In particular  the Marxists complain about Vaillant 
who is constantly touring the provinces for propaganda 
a economic matters  
=====第353页=====
Letters- 1894 327 
purposes and is alleged to be spreadi ng all manner of false calumnies about 
the Marxists there. At one time Vaillant used almost always to act in concert 
with the Marxists but 1. He is a strictly Blanquist party man who carries out 
the party’s resolutions no matter what the circumstances, and for two years 
there has been trouble between the Blanquists and the Marxists; and 2. There 
are a great many Possibilists 30 in his constituency; he needs these people and 
this is partly why he has gone over to them. 
It is very possible that the ne w reactionary measures in France 383 will act 
as a spur to the new Socialists and that the group of sixty will gradually 
become a truly socialist group. But that is not yet the case and things might 
well turn out differently. 
In this country life is proceeding in the usual English leisurely fashion. 
Economic and political developments alike are increasingly impelling the 
majority of English working men in our direction, but it may be years before 
these ‘pragmatists’, wholly unaccustom ed to taking a theoretical view of 
things and incapable of seeing beyond their own noses, become conscious of 
their own feelings and requirements unless virtually forced to do so. In the 
meantime political intrigue of the bourge ois-parliamentary variety continues 
to flourish mightily amongst the ‘leader s’, and never a day goes by without 
one’s hearing of some startling instance of this. 
Ludwig is today sitting his examination for admission as M EMBER , (not 
merely L ICENCIATE ) OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS . The thing goes 
on for a fortnight. Soon after it is over we shall, with any luck, be able to go 
to the seaside—this year I shall be  prevented from leaving England by 
domestic business.

Dear Baron, 
There is no hurry about printing the article.a Once I have seen to the 
proofs you can print it when you wish, in September, say, or even October. I 
have been mulling the thing ever ever since 1841 when I read a lecture 
a F. Engels, On the History of Early Christianity.  
=====第355页=====
Letters- 1894 329 
by F. Benary on Revelation. Since then I have been in no doubt that here we 
have the earliest and most important book in the New Testament. After a 
gestation period of fifty-three years there is no great need to hasten its 
emergence into the world at large. As to your questions. 
1. If I have expressed myself correctly in other respects, I certainly would 
not describe serfs and small peasantsa as being amongst the earliest adherents 
of Christianity; rather I should number them amongst those classes where it 
might expect to find adherents. And to these they quite certainly belonged—
especially in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. There is no doubt that, from the time 
Christianity first spread  from Judaea to Northern Syria and Asia Minor and 
Greece, Egypt and Italy, it was in the towns that it developed and found its 
earliest adherents. 
2. You ask whether the millennium is of this world or of the next. That 
depends on how one interprets it. I call the next world that which comes after 
death. And on this point Revelation leaves one in absolutely no doubt 
whatever. The millennium is reserved only for the martyrs and at best for 
such Christians as happen to be still living when it comes about, and to that 
extent, for the latter, it is of this world, whereas  for the martyrs, who are 
only then resurrected fro m the dead, it is of the next. So it’s the old story: 
You P AYS YOUR MONEY AND YOU TAKES YOUR CHOICE . TO my mind what 
decides the issue is the f act that it is impossible unless one has a concept of 
immortality and a belief in reward and punishment in the next world. Even 
less of this world is the New Jerusalem which is to come after the 
millennium and the Last Judgement. 
But the so-called Pauline Epistles also have it that those believers still 
living at Christ’s second coming are to be ‘changed’, i.e. transformed and 
magnified from mortals into immortals. 
That the millennium was here depicted in earthly colours goes without 
saying. Even Revelation cannot rest content with such heavenly delights as 
sitting with a bare bottom on a damp cloud, twanging a harp with more or 
less gory hands and singing hymns to all eternity. 
The preface to Volume II Ib has 1. not yet been written and 2. I cannot give 
it to you. This solution of the rate of profit and price question and of 
a As can be judged from Kautsky’s letter of 23 Ju ly 1894, to which Engels is replying, there is 
apparently a slip of the pen here: Kleinbauern. Kleinbürger (petty bourgeois) in the ms. - b of

the distribution of price can only be given its due in the book itself. 
Save for Sorge and Schlüter there are no intelligent correspondents to be 
found anywhere in America, because th e Germans there stick obstinately to 
the same sectarian attitude towards th e workers as is stubbornly adhered to 
by the Social Democratic Federation 44 over here. Instead of seeing in the 
movements of the Americans the propulsive element which, even though it 
may take wrong or circuitous paths, is bound in the end to lead to the same 
goal as the one they themselves brought with them from Europe, they see 
only the wrong paths, treat the blind, foolish Americans with arrogant 
condescension, boast of their own orthodox superiority, repel the Americans 
instead of attracting them and, as a resu lt, have themselves remained a small, 
impotent sect. Hence it has come about that their writers have also relapsed 
into pure ideology and place a false and narrow interpretation on conditions 
as a whole. Little Hepner, for one, could always be said to have lived in a 
world of fantasy and when he gets sen timental his stuff beggars description. I 
once read a comedy of his—though the funny bits were pretty good, the 
serious love scenes contained so mu ch gush that one became convulsed with 
laughter. 
Kindest regards from one household to another.

him for it, yours is older and claims attention first; and indeed I have been 
trying to find time to write, all the week, and have been stopped day after day 
by interruptions endless in number and variety. The fact is I am not sure of 
remaining much longer in 122; I ought to have settled that business last year, 
but was enjoying myself on the continent, 189 and now have to face the 
dilemma: either to get the whole house thoroughly overhauled or to look out 
for another. I have attended to both eventualities, and maybe in a few weeks 
may know where I am, or at least where I am to be in future. 
You ask about Pumps. I have hardly heard from them for months past. 
Percy had lost, or given up, the agency for his brothers in the Isle of Wight; 
he had spent a lot of money (not his own) but induced me to become surety 
for him for a loan to enable him to look out for other agencies in the same 
line of business, where he said he could make it pay. All at once, in June, I 
am informed by him that, in consequence of some arrangement with his 
family, he is going to sell up his furniture and come back to London; on my 
remonstrating, I am told it is now too late and the plan must be carried out. 
Then I heard that they were at a school  in Kent where their little boy is, and 
at last, last Monday, they turned up here. As far as I can learn, the family 
arrangement is all moonshine, at least it leaves him in the same shiftless 
position as before, After all I have done  for them, I am not going to quietly 
submit to such treatment, and did not r eceive them very heartily. What Percy 
is going to do and how this is to end, is more than I know. The children are at 
schools. Lily at Herne Bay and is said  to be getting on well; the boy is near

indeed awful reading—the disc ursive matter as well as the soi-disantb reports 
of facts, and you will not be astonished  to learn that I do no longer long for it,

evolution I should like to follow) and Millerand. Les élucubrations de MM.

I am really obliged to the Ere Nouvelle for giving you a chance to restore 
in the French Manifeste,a as published by the Socialiste, those passages 
where the Parisian text revisers, dans l’intérêt et de la langue française et des 
auteurs du ‘Manifeste’,b had considerably narrowed the horizon of certain 
expressions. Of course I shall be very gl ad to see it reprinted as often as you 
can get it done. 
My congratulations to Paul  on the Delagrave acquisition. 386 May this lead 
to further business! 
Where do I go this summer? alas all hope of going to Le Perreux is 
knocked on the head by that beautiful new law! 383 And the worst of it is that 
this time the old English lawyer’s saying becomes applicable to France: the 
law is there, and what the courts will make of it, is more than we know. My 
impression is that the government will not  lose much time before it sees that 
a precedent is established of the applica tion of that law to Socialism, and to 
the inclusion of Socialism under the heading of anarchism. The Cour de 
cassationc is quite capable of that. The German Socialist law 15 kept me from 
Germany thirteen years, let us hope th is new law will not last long enough to 
prevent me from coming to Fr ance once more in my life. 
Paul is not quite so enthusiastic about the situation in in France as ce cher 
Bonnier who considers the whole de bate—result and all—an unmitigated 
triumph for French Socialism; but s till his way of looking at the subject 
seems to me rather couleur de rose. The main advantage I consider indeed to 
be the irrefutable proof that our part y is the only real and serious opposition 
party in France as well as in Germ any; and that the French Radicals 86 are no 
more serious in their pretended oppositi on than the German Richters & Co. 
From that, as Paul says, a real union of  all Socialist elements must grow; and 
the persecution now initiated will hasten it; and if this unification, under the 
auspices of Jaurès, Millerand & Co, and their lot,d means a lowering of the 
standard of the official expression of the party, un abaissement de niveau 
intellectuel et politique,e this comes from the previous indulging in 
revolutionary phraseology, as Paul also sees very clearly, and is but the 
necessary consequence of it.

My dear Turati, 
A certain Mr Pasquali has arrived here a couple of days ago saying that he 
has been banished for the Sicily business 388 and was obliged to leave Paris, 
where he was a correspondent for Punto Nero (and in possession of 
authorisation from the editorial board), but  had been threatened by the police. 
In Turin he was a preacher or missionary  of the English sect of Baptists, 
and showed me the letter from his eccles iastical superior in which he was 
removed from this post because of his socialism. 
He will need assistance si nce, even if he serious ly looked for work, he 
does not speak a word of English. 
As in other countries we have had some curious experiences with ex-ec-
clesiastics of Christian, Jewish and other religions. I and my other friends 
here would be obliged to you if you c ould give us some information on this 
man, who claims to know you. 
Has he indeed been banished from Italy? 
Has he indeed been obliged to  leave Paris to escape pursuit? 
Has he indeed played a role, and if so, what, in the events in Sicily and in 
the socialist movement in Italy in general?

Dear Iglesias, 
I have received your letters of 8 June  and 27 July. With regard to your 
congress 390 I have written to Berlin (the answer is affirmative) and to Vienna 
(no answer so far); also to th e Social Democratic Federation 44 here (H. W. 
Lee, Secretary), the Independent Labor Party 114 (Tom Mann, Secretary) and 
the gas workers 391 (W. Thorne, Secretary; Comrade Avelinga is a member of 
the Executive Council)—they will all dr op you a line. Further, to the 
Standing Parliamentary Committee of the Trades-Unions Congress 28 
(Fenwick, Secretary, M. P.), the League for Eight Hours 197 (Sheridan, 
Secretary; they are certa in to write to you) and the Fabian Society 43 (E. R. 
Pease, Secretary), from which I have received no reply. 
The above list will give you an idea of the personal divisions, jealousies 
and quarrels adorning the labour move ment here. Look: on Monday, the 6th 
instant, the S. D. F. held a conference. There it was proposed that in the 
coming parliamentary elections the S. D. F. should support the candidates of 
the Independent Party provided that they  declared themselv es socialists. The 
proposal was rejected. But if the ‘independents’ refuse to vote for the 
Federation’s candidates and to support th em, they will be seen as traitors! 
Further, the S. D. F. Conferen ce resolved that because the London 
international congress in 1896 392 is not to be exclusively socialist, the 
Federation will convene an exclus ively socialist international

congress, to be opened three days befo re the general congress of workers!! 
What will the socialists of other nations say? While all that—and much 
else—has no practical importance, those are attempts by various groups to 
exploit in their particular interests the convocation and holding of an 
international congress. It is best not to discuss or attach too much importance 
to those things in the press until they have taken a more distinct form. For all 
that, the movement among the working masses is making headway, the idea 
of socialising the means of producti on is gaining ground, and the day will 
come when the class-conscious masses throw out all schemers and corrupt 
leaders. 
Every week Comrade Eleanor Marx-Aveling publishes in Workman’s 
Times a report on progress in the international movement. You would do well 
to send her El Socialista if possible, for she understands Spanish. Address:

I have returned your textile worker.a Dogmatism. If one wants to base 
oneself on that sort of dogma, one ought to secure one’s allies in advance, 
otherwise one is likely to make an ass of oneself. 395 
As to the Social Democratic Federation 44 and its special congress, I have 
already advised Spainb of the matter and shall do the same in the case of Italy 
and Paris, but am asking the chaps not to make too much fuss about it for the 
time being. For either the Social Democr atic Federation issues a circular to 
justify the resolution and get its own brand of agitation going or we scotch 
the whole thing simply by means of statements in the Continental press to the 
effect that not a single delegate would be sent to such a congress. If, however, 
the circular does appear, there will be o fficial discussions about it on all sides 
and that would be far preferable. 
The Social Democratic Federation must have got wind of the 
Parliamentary Committee’s 28 S061 proposal (long bruited about) to change 
the 1896 Congress 392 into a TRADES UNION congress and to take the requisite 
steps to that end in Norwich. 396 Hence they obviously wanted to be first in 
the field. These little schemes might well result in the Continentals saying: 
Neither of the two congresses is the one you ought to convoke and, since you 
don’t want  to convoke the latter, we’ll simply go somewhere else and leave 
you to settle your squabbles between you. 
It is inconceivably stupid of the Social Democratic Federation to have 
passed at the same time the resolution in regard to the Independent Labour 
Party 114 candidates, whether Socialists or not. It’s the old story: either you are 
a Socialist, in which case you belong to the Social Democratic Federation or 
else you are unwilling to join the Social Democratic Federation, in which 
case you are no Socialist. But what s eems to have entirely escaped their 
minds is the fact that these two resolutions, set side by side, would be bound 
to make the Continentals feel disinclined to have anything to do with the 
Social Democratic Federation’s congress. 
All this, incidentally, has left me comparatively unmoved. Between now 
and the congress all kinds of water will flow down the Thames and neither 
the quantity nor the quality of that water can possibly be predicated today. 
I am writing to August too about all these things, incl. Arndt.

Pasquali.a Fortunately, the ‘ seccatore diprima sfera 398 ha cessato di seccare la 
nostra sfera.b In my day they said in Milan 398 of those banished financiers 
who took the road to Switzerland ‘L’ è ànd à Varés’c: Pasquali has gone to 
Edinburgh, where he is probably going to try his fortune. He announced his 
visit ‘ colla mia moglie e col mio piccolo Marx Guglielmo’,d but he never 
came, and when one of our friends went to his lodgings, he was told that Mr 
Pasquali had left, with his family, for Edinburgh. Probably some ‘Christian 
socialists’, of whom there are a large number here, and someone else from a 
religious sect, will become interested in this interesting character. Let us wish 
him bon voyage\  
Your bust of Marx does not have many admirers here. 400 There is too little 
of Marx and too much of Garibaldi in the head. Moreover, even if the bust 
bore a resemblance, it would be difficult to sell it outside Italy. In Paris they 
have just struck a rather big medallion which they are trying to sell, and in 
Germany, Austria and Switzerland these Marxes in plaster have multiplied to 
the point of being unsaleable. 
Your law on suspects 401 goes further than ours of 1878, 15 and the one 
passed in France in 1894. 383 It entails administrative exile as in Russia. I 
hope, however, that this is one of t hose instances which will illustrate the 
German proverb ‘ es wird nichts so heiss gegessen wie es gekocht wird.’e What 
is certain is that, of all the countries of Europe, Italy is the one where all 
political ailments suffer acute inflammation: rebellion with the outright use 
of force on the one hand, and excessively violent reaction on the other. 
However, where Bismarck failed, Cris pi will certainly not succeed: in the 
end persecution will strengthen socialism in Italy, and all that I desire is that 
this squall will pass without forcing you temporarily into e ither the hell of 
Eritrea or the purgatory of London. 
Speaking of London, the Social Democratic Federation, 44 one of the five 
or six socialist sects here—it has a Marxist programme, but the tactics of an 
exclusive sect—has just held a congress at which two quite important 
resolutions were adopted. The first is characteristic of this Federation: it was 
proposed that the Federation should support the candidates of the 
Independent Labour Party 114 in the coming parliamentary elections if these 
candidates proclaim themselves openly to be socialist—rejected

by a large majority. The Independent Party of Workers is a rival group which 
has also included ‘the socialisation of the means of production’ in its 
programme, and which consequently is socialist, although it does not 
publicise this fact, and has as its aim to secure the election of worker can-
didates independent from the Conservativ e and Liberal parties. Everyone had 
hoped that these two groups would join together for the elections, but no, 
says the Federation: either you are socialists, in which case you should join 
our ranks, or else you refuse to join us, and constitute a separate group, and 
then you are not socialists. So creat e a movement with such elements! 
However, now for that which concerns us more nearly. After a debate in 
which it emphasised the fact that the congresses held in Paris, 227 Brussels 228 
and Zurich 229 were not truly socialist congresses, and that it is time for the 
socialists to free themselves from the trade-union (corporative) element 
which is not socialist, the Federation has officially resolved to convene in 
London, in 1896, a purely socialist congress which will begin three days 
before the general congress in London. 392 
Note that the group which is calling on the socialist world to attend a 
special congress which has no mandate whatever, declared at the congress I 
have just referred to that it had 4,500 members; but according to the 
secretary,a last year they had 7,000 names on the membership list, so that 
they have lost almost as many as they have retained, and another member 
boasted that during the fourteen years that this organisation has existed, no 
less than a million members have joined and left (except for the 4,500 
mentioned above). 
An organisation possessing such an ability to attract (and repel), which 
rejects all socialist candidates save its  own (note that the Independent Labour 
Party, in the provinces, exists in perfect harmony with the SDF!), and which 
also wishes to exclude the trade unions at a time when they (our largest and 
most promising terrain for propaganda) are probably going to declare 
themselves at Norwich 396 for the second time in favour of the socialisation 
of the means of production (adopted at Belfast in 1893) 402 and adopted again 
by the council of workers of London 197 in 1894—such an organisation is 
indeed well positioned to take the initiative on such a question. 
The continental socialists, now unite d in all the countries, will have

to judge whether or not they should agree to the convocation of a congress at 
which they will have to pass resolutions which will bind them in advance as 
regards their actions at the general congress. This could not but annoy—and 
quite rightly—the delegates to the main congress sent by groups which are 
not quite socialist. And as we know by experience that these groups, by the 
very fact of attending our congresses, are unconsciously drawn into the 
socialist lap—the English trade unions are the best proof of this—are we 
going to be sufficiently narrow to close this door? 
You have no idea of the intrigues afoot here as regards this congress. The 
parliamentary committee of the Trade Union Congress 28 wishes, so it is said, 
to take control of our congress in order to transform it into a trade union 
congress pure and simple, like the one held here in 1888, 403 and about which 
C. Lazzari could tell you certain thi ngs. Naturally, on the continent the 
response to this attempt will be burst s of laughter. However, the Social 
Democratic Federation would seem to have taken these rumours seriously, 
and wishes to take advantage of them so that it can take control of the 
congress and turn it into a separate event. As the resolution adopted by the 
SDF is official and has been published, one can discuss it in the press. 
However, it would be better not to lend it too much importance, as it is 
clearly an attempt to see which way the wind is blowing, and will become 
important only if there then come steps to carry it through, a circular letter of 
invitation, etc., etc.

AT LE PERREUX

4 Royal Parade 
 
My dear Lafargue, 
Here we are at Eastbourne since the past week, 393 Louise, her husband 
and I. I needed it badly and the ozonised sea air is already taking effect. 
Unfortunately it has been raining more  than necessary since yesterday. 
Your cheque will arrive during the firs t days of next month as soon as I 
shall have had some payments. 
I am very curious to see how they are going to administer the new law 
against suspects. 383 I am by no means sure that they will not use it against the 
Socialists as much as against the anarchists at a given moment. But though a 
few individuals may suffer by it, this law will certainly do for you what the 
‘78 law did for the Germans; 15 you will defeat it and you will emerge from 
the struggle infinitely stronger than you went into it. 
Here the Social Democratic Federation, 44 which for a time seemed to try 
to adopt a reasonable and tolerable lin e of conduct, has suddenly fallen back 
on the Hyndmanniads of yore. At the Congress which they held in London a 
fortnight or three weeks ago, 404 the Liverpool delegate moved that at the next 
general elections they should s upport the Independent Labour Party 114 
candidates provided they publicly declared themselves Socialists. This, 
against all the rules of English procedure, was turned down in favour of a 
motion adopted by 42 to 12, that the duty of every Socialist was to belong to 
an openly revolutionary socialist organisation, such as the Social Democratic 
Federation (and as the S.D.F. claims th at apart from itself there is no other, 
this meant: belong to the S.D.F.). As for electoral tactics, this was delegated 
to a committee which will report to the Executive Committee. You know of 
course that the nationalisation of the means of production is an integral part 
of the I.L.P. programme. Thus, the reciprocity which hitherto has existed in 
the North (particularly in Lancashire and Yorkshire) between the two groups, 
is to all intents and purposes rejected by the S.D.F. which proclaims the 
policy of

the Caliph Omar in burning the Alexandria library: either these books are 
contrary to the Koran, in which case th ey are bad; or they contain the same 
thing, in which case they are superfluous—into the flames with them! And 
these people claim the leadership of the socialist movement in Britain! 
But there is worse to come. Hyndman  has stated that it was time for 
socialism to detach itself outright from trade unionism, and that instead of 
joint congresses of the two, there should be an out and out socialist congress. 
And, as it was realised at the same time that it is still too early to strike a 
direct blow against the 1896 Congress, 392 they resolved that the S.D.F. 
should convene an exclusively socialist Congress to be held in London three 
days before the general Congress of 1896.  
What will the continentals  say to that? Will they go to such a congress in 
order later to attend the large, our congress, tied hand and foot by the 
resolutions passed two or three days earlier 1 in a small committee? Will they 
provoke a split between the delegates who are thoroughgoing Socialists and 
those who are not yet that but are on the point of becoming so? Will they 
administer this slap in the face to the British trade unionists, who have made 
such progress since the New Unionism 405 has set them on the road towards 
socialism, who at Belfast in 1893 402 voted for the nationalisation of the 
means of production (adopted a few week s ago in the political programme of 
even the recalcitrant London Trades Council 197) and which, in a fortnight’s 
time, at Norwich 396 will be stating its position in relation to us once again? 
But do you know how the S.D.F. in its  annual report and the speeches at a 
conference depicted the strength of that organisation which claims to change 
the Zurich resolutions 229 (for this is a palpable emendation which contradicts 
the Zurich resolution)? It has—4,500 members. Last year 7,000 names 
passed through its membership list, so it has lost 2,500! But what of it? asks 
Hyndman. In the 14 years of its ex istence the S.D.F. has seen a million 
people pass through its ranks. What orga nisation! Out of one million, 
995,500 have hopped it, but—4,500 have stayed! 
Now for the key to all these idiocies, inconceivable without that key. The 
1896 Congress will not leave untouched an y of the sects, fractions, groups, 
etc. which compose what one calls here Organised Labour. The 
Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Congress 28 would very much like

TO BOSS THE Congress. There are already motions tabled on the agenda for 
the Trades Congress at Norwich (Septe mber) to confine admission of British 
delegates to the ‘96 Congress only to those qualified for the Trades 
Congress: bona fide workingmen, working or having worked at the trade 
they represent. And it is said that they are not a little desirous of extending 
this system to the continental delegates as well, which would cause 
explosions of laughter violent enough to shake all London to its foundations. 
Very well, the S.D.F., which, in its turn, thinks the opportunity has come for 
it to boss the Congress and, through C ongress, the British movement, appears 
to have taken these rumours as an ex cuse to launch its little counter-plan. 
So far it is only a feeler. But as soon as the S. D. F. issues an invitation 
circular or something of that kind, the matter will take on substance, and the 
continental parties will be calle d upon to come to a decision. 
One question: Le Socialiste lebt or noch, oder aber ist er tot?a Since April 
we haven’t seen a trace of it. If y ou have succeeded in killing it, do you 
count this as one of the Party’s victories in France? 
Whatever the case, the two months of September and October will be 
interesting. Towards the 5, the Trades Congress, at Norwich 396 (after the 
Spanish congress 390 next Sunday), then your congress at Nantes, 406 then the 
Germans at Frankfurt on 21 October. 418 The last two will be dealing with the 
question of peasants and farm workers. Overall, the views of the two national 
groups are the same, only that you intransigent revolutionaries of the bygone 
days are now inclining a little more to wards opportunism than the Germans, 
who probably will not support any measure which might serve to maintain or 
conserve small property against the corrosive action of capitalism. On the 
other hand, they will agree with you that it is not our task to accelerate or 
intensify this corrosive action, and that a most important thing is to organise 
small property-holders into agricultural associations to cultivate land in 
common and on a large scale. I am curious to see which of the two 
congresses will show itself to be the mo re advanced in economic theory and 
propose the more effective practical measures.

As to Edwards, I would in your place first inquire from the Avelings as to 
why they refused and what they know about the man. In English the 
expression ‘D ON’T KNOW HIM’ is not wholly unequivocal. If you are 
prepared to sacrifice the time, it would certainly be quite a good idea, if you 
prevent an Arndt, say, or a Hyndman, from writing the article. On the other 
hand contributing to an annual of this sort which has suddenly been brought 
into being by someone you don’t know can involve you in some unpleasant 
experiences. The chap can’t take it amiss if you ask him

We got back this evening. 393 The Baron wants me to let him have some 
‘unpublished stuff on the International. I have now searched through my old 
papers and found something that might possibly do. Could you pick it up 
here so that it can be translated? Time is pressing, to judge by the Baron’s

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
[Fragment]  
[London, second half of September 1894 
Now to something else. The Trades Union Congress 396 marks a distinct 
progress against last year, and combined  with the Leicester election and other 
symptoms, shows that things are on the move in England. Of course there is 
no progress here without a drawback: take the resolution against foreign 
working men immigration passed at Norw ich; but such contradictions and 
inconsistencies one will have to put up with for some time yet ‘in this free 
country’. The moment will come after a ll, when the masses, having attained a 
sufficient degree of consciousness, will break through the tangled web of the 
intrigues and sectarian squabbles of the ‘leaders’. 
The war between China and Japan 409 seems to me instigated by the 
Russian government, who use Japan as their tool. But whatever may be the 
proximate consequences of this war, it must lead to one thing: the total 
break-up of the whole traditional system in old China. There, an old-
fashioned system of agriculture and domestic industry combined has been 
artificially kept going by rigid exclusion of all disturbing elements. That 
exclusion of everything foreign has been partially broken through by the 
wars with the English and French; this war with Asiatics, rivals living next 
door to the Chinese, must put a complete stop to it. 
The Chinese, licked on land and on sea, will have to Europeanise 
themselves, open their ports generally to trade, establish railways and fac-
tories, and thus completely smash up that old system which made it possible 
to feed so many millions. There w ill be all of a sudden a constantly 
increasing surplus population, supersed ed peasants, who will flock to the 
coast to search for a living in foreign lands. Where up to now thousands 
emigrated, millions will want to go then. And then the Chinese Coolies will 
be everywhere, in Europe as well as America and Australia, and will try to 
reduce wages and the standard of living of our working men to the Chinese 
level. And then the time will come for our European workmen. 
=====第374页=====
348 Letters- 1894 
And the English will be the first to suffer from this invasion and to fight. I 
fully expect that this Japan-Chinese War will hasten our victory in Europe by 
five years at least, and facilitate it immensely, as it will drive all non-
capitalist classes over to our side. Only the large landed proprietors and 
manufacturers will be pro-Chinese. 
Paul’s articles in the Neue Zeit- are on the whole very good.a There are 
some historical views in them that do him great credit. The exposition of the 
causation and course of French history since 1871 is the best I have yet seen. 
I have learned a good deal from them. 
But the considérant of the Na ntes agricultural programme, 406 which 
declares it the duty of the Socialists to maintain and defend the peasants’ 
property, and even the fermiers and métayers who employ labourers, is more 
than most people outside France will be able to swallow.

Your appeal for documents on the Internationalb reached me while I was

return the following day (Tuesday), I looked out something for Ede and we 
asked him to call that evening but he had to finish the article for the Neue 
Zeit.a On Wednesday morning the things were collected by Ernst,b but were 
brought back that same evening by Ede who said that it was now too late and 
that in any case you already had something. What I had found was in any 
case nothing out of the ordinary. It is difficult to find an unknown document 
of the Internationals that will, of itself, still have a telling effect today. 
Many thanks for the Entwicklung in Armenian. Luckily I can’t read it. 
As regards the fee for Marx’s chapters, kindly deduct this from, or 
alternatively charge it against, the fee for my own article and remit it to me 
for the heirs. Should mine be insufficient, kindly set off the difference 
against future contributions. 411 
Needless to say copies of the complete issue will do just as well as off-
prints of the article. I only need them for one or two quite specific incidental 
purposes. 
The payment of fees to the Austrians remains in force until further notice. 
The Italians are beginning to fill me with dread. Yesterday that blath-erer 
Enrico Ferri sent me all his recent wr itings along with an over-cordial letter 
which only served to make me feel less cordial towards him than ever. And 
yet one is expected to send the chap a courteous reply! His book on Darwin-
Spencer-Marxd is an atrocious hotchpotch of insipid rubbish. The Italians 
will long continue to suffer from this their younger genera tion of heddicated 
bourgeois. I shall doubtless soon have to do something to put an end to the 
ominous increase in my popularity (which the chaps are not fostering 
WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE EYE TO BUSINESS ). Meanwhile I shall make a bit 
of an example of Achille Lo ria in the preface to the 3rd volume.e

ENGELS TO EMILE VANDERVELDE 
IN BRUSSELS 
[Draft]  
[London, after 21 October 1894] 
 
Dear citizen Vandervelde, 
Allow me to express my congratulations to you personally on your elec-
tion, and also to our Belgian comrades in general on their splendid successes 
these last two Sundays. 412 This second victory of the Belgian proletariat is of 
great importance for us all.b Small countries such as Belgium and 
Switzerland are our modern political  laboratories, the testing ground 
a ruin - b The following phrase is crossed out by Engels: “If a small country like yours is not 
destined to resolve the great problems of our epoch on its own...”

where experiments are carried out whic h can be later applied to the large 
states. It is often from these small countries that there comes the first impulse 
of a movement destined to overturn Europe. Thus, before the February 
revolution,a there was the Swiss war of the Sonderbund. 273 
At the moment we are, it seems to me, in a period of high tide, a period 
which dates from the suffrage vi ctory of the Belgian workers. 276 After 
Belgium, Austria joined the suffrage  movement; following Austria, pro-
letarian Germany has just requested th at universal suffrage  be extended from 
the Reichstag to the parliaments of the federal states. The repressive laws 
launched against the work er parties in France 383 and Italy, 401 similar laws 
being prepared in Germany, will ha ve no more success than the violent 
measures of the Austrian government. Today the socialist movement 
everywhere is more powerful than the so-called public force.b 
As for the Belgian workers, 14th October assures them an even stronger 
position. For the first time they have learned to know precisely their own 
forces and those of the enemy; thus henceforth they will be able to base their 
tactical decisions on knowledge of the situation; and you and the other 
socialist representatives will be able to raise your heads still higher, and will 
be listened to with considerably more attention following official recognition 
of the fact that you are the mouthpiece of 350,000 Belgian citizens. It is with 
you that the Belgian proletariat is making its ‘joyous entry’ into parliament, 
an entry that is joyous not only for you, but for the proletarians of the whole 
of Europe!

Dear Sorge, 
From the above address you will s ee that I have moved house. After 
Louise’s marriage our old home had become rather too cramped and, since 
the consequences of that marriage soon manifested themselves, we could no 
longer make do. We therefore took a larger house which became available a 
little further down the road, close by the gates into Regent’s Park and, after a 
great bother, moved in four weeks ago—bother with house agents, solicitors, 
contractors, furniture salesmen, etc., and it’s not yet over, my books being 
still in great disarray. Downstairs we have our communal living-rooms, on 
the first floor my study and bedroom, on the second Louise, her husband, the 
baby daughter, born on Tuesday the 6th of this month, and nursery maid, on 
the third floor the two housemaids, lumber-room and visitor’s room. My 
study is at the front, has three windows and is so big that I can accommodate 
nearly all my books (eight cases full) in it and yet, despite its size, very nice 
and easy to heat. In short, we are a lot better off. In the circumstances Louise 
and her baby are very well, and everything went off swimmingly. 
Today, you will get two fat parcels, 3 copies of the (Berlin) 
Sozialdemokrat, 3 of the Pest Volksstimme, the rest of the proceedings of the 
Party Conference in the Vorwärts 418 and a Critica Sociale containing a letter 
by me. 1 Because of the removal, we have not been able to send things quite 
so regularly. The Workman’s Times no longer exists, more’s the pity. Tussy’s 
articles in it were the only ones in which the truth about the Continental 
movement was neither withheld from the English workers nor falsified.

masses which tells them that Labour must form a party of its own in op-
position to the two official parties is growing ever stronger and was more 
than ever in evid ence at the municipal elections on 1 November. But old 
traditional memories of various kinds, combined with a lack of people who 
might be capable of translating that instinct into conscious action and 
crystallising it throughout the land, are conducive to the prolongation of this 
preliminary stage—a stage at which thinking is ill-defined and action isolated 
and localised. Anglo-Saxon sectarianism is also rife in the Labour 
movement. The Social Democratic Federation. 44 just like your German 
Socialist Labor Party, 367 has succeeded in turning our  theory into the rigid 
dogma of an orthodox sect and is not only narrowly exclusive but, thanks to 
Hyndman, has a thoroughly rotten traditi on where international politics is 
concerned, a tradition which, although shaken from time to time, has 
nevertheless remained intact. The Independent Labor Party 114 is excessively 
vague in the matter of tactics, while its leader, Keir Hardie, is an over-canny 
Scot whose demagogic tricks one cannot trust for a moment. Although a poor 
devil of a Scottish miner, he has started a big weekly, The Labour Leader, 
something that could not have been effected without a great deal of money, 
and this money he obtains from a Tory or at any rate Liberal-Unionist, 206 i.e. 
anti-Gladstonian and anti-Home Rule quarter 171—of that there can be no 
doubt, as is confirmed not only by first-hand information and his own 
political attitude, but also by the litera ry connections he is known to possess 
in London. Consequently he might—through the defection of the Irish and 
Radical voters—very easily lose his parliamentary seat in the General 
Election of 1895 345 and this would be fortunate, for at the moment the man is 
the greatest stumbling-block of all. He appears in Parliament only on 
demagogic occasions, so as to draw atte ntion to himself by  spouting hot air 
about the UNEMPLOYED to no effect whatever, or else to address inanities to 
the Queena on the birth of some princeb which, in this country, is cheap and 
trivial to the utmost, etc. Otherwise, and particularly in the provinces, there 
are some very good elements, both in the Social Democratic Federation and 
in the Independent Labor Party —eleme nts which, though scattered, have at 
least succeeded in frustrati ng every attempt made by the leaders to set the 
two organisations at each other’s throat s. John Burns is something of a lone 
wolf politically; he is furiously attacked by both Hyndman and

Keir Hardie and acts as though, ha ving despaired of a political Labour 
organisation, he is now pinning his hopes solely on the Trades Unions. True, 
his experience with the former has not been altogether happy and he might 
starve if the Engineers Union did not pay his parliamentary salary. He is 
vain, having let himself be rather exce ssively soft-sawdered by the Liberals, 
i.e. by the ‘social wing’ of the Radicals, and definitely sets too much store by 
the many individual concessions he has obtained, but is for all that the only 
really honest man in the whole movement, i.e. among its leaders, and has a 
thoroughly proletarian instin ct by which he will, or  so I believe, be guided 
more surely at the crucial moment th an will the others by their cunning and 
calculated self-interest. 
On the Continent success has kindled an appetite for more success, and 
peasant-catching in the literal sense of the terma is coming to be all the rage. 
First the French declare at Nantes, through Lafargue, 419 not only that it is no 
business of ours (I had already written and told them as muchb) to precipitate 
the ruin of the small peasant by direct intervention, a task that may safely be 
entrusted to capitalism, but also that it behoves us actually to protect the 
small peasant against taxation, usury and the big landowner. But we cannot 
go along with this, firstly because it is stupid and secondly because it is 
impossible. Next, Vollmar 418 goes to Frankfurt and actually proposes to 
bribe your peasant as such; nor is the peasant with whom he is concerned in 
Upper Bavaria, your small, debt-ridden Rhenish chap, but your middling if 
not big peasant who exploits his farmhands, male and female, and sells cattle 
and grain in quantity. And that would not be feasible unless one were to 
abandon the whole principle of the thing. We can only win over the Alpine 
peasants and the big peasants of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein at 
the cost of betraying their ploughboys and day labourers, and in so doing we 
should lose politically more than we  should gain. The Frankfurt Party 
Conference failed to come to any decision on this question and that is a good 
thing, in as much as the matter w ill now be properly gone into; the people 
who attended it knew far too little about peasants, or rural conditions, which 
vary so greatly from province to province, to do anything more than form 
resolutions out of thin air. But the matter will have to be settled sooner or 
later.

Here a question occurs to me about the Paris Socialiste; is it still alive or 
is it dead? No one seems to know, When Tussy was in Paris this summer it 
was not yet defunct, but anyone who wanted a copy had to go to the office 
and get one!! I haven’t set eyes on it si nce February or March. Dereure has 
gone off his head. He was manager and, having got things into a mess, did 
nothing whatever about it. Typically French. 
Following the electoral victories in Belgium, 412 the Belgians and French 
are making arrangements for the socialist parliamentarians in the various 
countries to keep in regular touc h with each other and hold periodic 
conferences. Whether anything will come of this is questionable. At the 
moment the fifty French parliamentarians (among them some twenty-six 
Radical 86 converts of a somewhat dubious kind) are very pleased with 
themselves, but there are snags. Amongst the twenty-four old Socialists a 
fierce but silent struggle is going on between the Marxists on the one hand 
and the Blanquists 20 and Allemanists 21 (Possibilists 30) on the other; whether 
it will result in an open br each is hard to say. 
Besides other socialist papers, I am now also sent the Romanian one 
(Munca) and the Bulgarian (formerly Rabotnik (Working Man), now 
(Socialist), and am gradually familiarising my self with those languages, The 
Romanians are going to bring out a daily in Bucharest.a 
More than any other world event, the d eath of the Russian Tsar is likely to 
bring about a change, either as a result of an internal movement or as a result 
of a financial crisis and the impossibility of obtaining money abroad. I 
cannot suppose that the existing system will continue to subsist if it brings to 
the throne an idiot whose health, both physical and mental, has been 
shattered by onanism. (This fact is notorious in all the faculties of medicine. 
Krause, a professor at Dorpat,b who attended Nicholas, informed Tsar 
Alexander at the latter’s request th at this—onanism—was the immediate 
cause of the illness, was boxed over the ear s for his pains, resigned, returned 
the Order of Vladimir sent him after his departure, and went back to 
Germany where he related the story.) If the fun begins in Russia, however, 
young William, too, will become aware that something novel is afoot. For 
then a liberal wind will blow through Europe—a wind which now can only 
be of benefit to us.

engines, electricity and large-scale industry is essential if only for reasons of 
military defence. But this means the co llapse of the old economic system of 
small farms, a system in which the family also manufactured its industrial 
products, and with it that of the whole of the old social system which 
admitted of a relatively dense popula tion. Millions will be evicted and 
compelled to emigrate and those millions will find their way as far, even, as 
Europe, whither they will come in drove s. But in your country as in ours, 
Chinese competition will, as soon as it attains massive proportions, quickly 
bring things to a head and thus the c onquest of China by capitalism will at the 
same time provide the impulse for the overthrow of capitalism in Europe and 
America. 
I hope you and your wife are feeling better than when you wrote last.

wide is the gap between 73 and 37.

time I had to hurry off the very badly printed proofs of the last 5 or 6 sheets 
Capital (proofs and revision); and that in c onsequence of all this not only my 
correspondence but also your French Manifestob in the Ere Nouvelle got 
sadly neglected. 
However this morning I hunted up the October and September Nos. of 
that revue from my higgledy-piggledy books and compared them with the 
original. Je vous en fais mes complimentsc—this is better then even the 
Feuerbach! 310 It is the first French translation of the old Manifest I read with 
real and unbroken pleasure. Unfortunately the November No. which contains 
the Conclusion has not yet come to hand, so I cannot look them over. A few 
suggestions follow, they are very unimportant. 
You may well say trois déménagements valent un incendiéd more than 
once I felt inclined to throw all my books into the fire, and house and all, 
such a bother it was. But now I expect the worst is over—that is to say the 
only little evil to contend with now is a flooded coal cellar and a sweating 
wine cellar! But that, too, must at last be vanquished. 
The Czare is dead, vive lé Czar,f and indeed the poor beggar does require 
all the encouragement the French bourgeoisie and press can give him by 
their shouts. He is next door to an idiot, weakly in mind and body, and 
promises just that vacillating reign of a man a mere playball of other 
people’s cross-purpose-intrigues which is wanted to break up finally the 
Russian despotic system. Financial difficulties will help. Mother Crawford

last Russian loan 123 and makes very improbable the success, in France, of the 
impending one. Out of France Nicholas will get no cash. When 6 or 7 years 
ago an attempt was made to raise the wind in Berlin, the bankers replied 
unanimously: With the guarantee of a National Assembly, any amount; 
without it, not a farthing; could not that cry be raised now, when the 
opportunity offers, in the Petite République? To tell the French gogosa that a 
constitution must come in Russia and that therefore it will not be safe to 
entrust their money to a moribund absolutism? Or does le patriotisme render 
such a proceeding too dangerous? 
Many thanks for your offer to translate my Urchristentum; 420 but do you 
really think that theological subj ect—especially II  and II I—attractive 
enough for French readers? I have my very strong misgivings. The I article 
might perhaps pass: les Internationaux sous l’empire des Césarsb or 
something like it—however that  I leave entirely to you. 
Bebel confirms in a letter today that Vollmar had said in Frankfurt, 418 had 
expressly approved the new programme agricole of Nantes; 406 now the only 
thing I wrote to anybody about it was to youc: that I was afraid the French 
would stand alone with their appeal to support, in this present condition, the 
petits propriétaires and even les fermiers qui sont obligés d’exploiter des 
ouvriers.d So Vollmar’s assertion is an invention of his own. Unfortunately it 
will compel me to reply in public 421 and in order to avoid provoking fresh 
misunderstandings, I shall be obliged to speak of the peasant question more 
fully, and then I cannot pass by the Na ntes debates. I shall send it to the Neue 
Zeit,e perhaps you will find that more interesting than Christianity.f 
This is how one gets always interrupted! This confounded peasant 
question will take me another week. And yet I have my hands full with work 
urgently needed, even before I come to start what I ought to do: the history of 
Mohr’s part in the International. And that leads me to something: in the 
Berlin (anarchist) Sozialist they publish from the Société Nouvelle a letter of 
Bakounine—very long—in which he give s his version of the Hague affair 115

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE AND ELEANOR MARX-
AVELING 
London, 14 November 1894 
To Laura Lafargue and Eleanor Marx-Aveling  
My dear girls, 
I have to address to you a few words with regard to my will. 
First you will find that I have taken the liberty of disposing of all my 
books, including those receive d from you after Mohr’s death, in favour of 
the German party. The whole of thes e books constitute a library so unique, 
and so complete at the same time, for the history and the study of Modern 
Socialism and all the sciences on which it is dependent, that it would be a 
pity to disperse it again.  To keep it together, and to place it at the same time 
at the disposal of those desirous to use it, has been a wish expressed to me 
long ago by Bebel and other leaders of the German Socialist Party, and as 
they do indeed seem to be the best people for that purpose, I have consented. 
I hope that under the circumstances you will pardon my action and give your 
consent too. 
Second. I have had many a discussion with Sam Moore as to the possi-
bility of providing, in my will, in some way for our dear Jenny’s children. 
Unfortunately, English law stands in the way. It could only be done under 
almost impossible conditions, where the expense would more than eat up the 
funds to be taken care of. I therefore had to give it up. Instead, I have left 
each of you three- eighths of the residue of my estate after defraying legacies 
etc. Of these, two -eighths are intended for yourselves, and the third eighth is 
meant to be held by each of you in trus t for Jenny’s children, to be used as 
you and the children’s guardian, Paul La fargue, may think best. In this way 
you are freed from all responsibility with  regard to English law and can act 
as your own moral sense and love for the children may dictate. 
The money I owe to the children for shares of profits on Mohr’s writings 
are put down in my ledger, and will be paid by my Executors to the party 
who, according to English law, will be  the children’s legal representative. 
And now good bye,  
My dear, dear girls. May you live long and healthily

Dear Baron, 
The agrarian articlea goes off to you today by registered book post. Since 
the handwriting is rotten, may I have the proofs? They will be promptly 
attended to. 
Am just reading Ledebour’s reply to you. 424 The chap’s trying to be too 
clever by half. As though, two years ago, you could have foreseen what 
Vollmar would be like today. And it really is a bit much to conclude, merely 
because the small peasant has been told there is no intention of forcibly 
evicting him, that the intention is to provide economic conditions such as will 
enable him to continue farming on his own account. Obviously, as things are 
today, you would have worded this or  that passage differently. But nobody is 
proof against verbal hair-splitting and my article might suffer exactly the 
same fate. 
I look forward to seeing how the polem ic initiated by Bebel is going to 
develop. 425 It was long overdue. 
I simply have not got the time just now to go into the matter of the 
International’s attitude to the question of land ownership. Besides, it has 
been a ticklish point so far as the Inte rnational is concerned. Firstly because 
of the Proudhonists in France, Belgium, etc., and their enthusiasm for parcels 
of land, and secondly because of Bakunin’s hobby-horse, the abolition of 
inheritance, which tended to obscure the issue. 426 
Needless to say, the Vorwärts has come down in favour of unity, i.e. of 
hushing things up. Nothing can be done about this for the present. But 
anyone who hushes things up can now only be of assistance to Vollmar and 
will have to bear the consequences. The only correct thing for me to do is, I 
think, to intervene in an absolutely objective way and leave personalities 
completely out of it. Otherwise it will again be said that I am 
a F. Engels, ‘The Peasant Qu estion in France and Germany’

Apropos, could you, when convenient, insert the enclosed review 427 in 
such a way that people don’t realise it emanates from me? I don’t want to put 
a correction in the Vorwärts, or Liebknecht would again append some 
rigmarole or other, and yet I cannot allow the thing to pass. 
Congratulations on son no. II I—as you will have heard, we have also had

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 22 November 1894  
My dear Lafargue, 
I have found your report in the Sozialdemokrat. 419 That was lucky, for it 
has allowed me to put the responsibility for quite a few things on a somewhat 
careless editorship and to conclude that, although I did not agree with what 
the Nantes resolution 406 said, I think I agree with what it tried to say. At the 
same time I have tried to be as friendly as possible; but in view of the way 
this resolution is being abused in Germany, it is no good remaining silent 
about it. 
The fact is you allowed yourself to lean a bit too much towards the 
opportunist tendency. At Nantes you came near to sacrificing the future of 
the Party to a momentary triumph. There is still time to call a halt: if my 
articlea can contribute towards this, I shall be happy. In Germany—

where Vollmar went so far as to suggest that the large peasants in Bavaria, 
each with the 10-30 hectares, should en joy all the benefits that you had 
promised to the sm all French peasants 418—in Germany Bebel took up the 
challenge, and the matter will be exhaustively discussed; it will not come off 
the agenda until it has been thrashed out. You will have seen in Vorwärts 
Bebel’s speech in the 2nd electoral constituency of Berlin. 425 He complains 
with reason that the party is going bourgeois. That is the misfortune of all 
extreme parties when the tim e approaches for them to  become ‘possible’. But 
our Party cannot go beyond a certain limit in this respect without betraying 
itself, and it seems to me that in Fran ce as in Germany we have now reached 
that point. Fortunately there is still time to call a halt. 
For some while I have not seen your letters in Vorwärts, and I thought 
there was some misunderstanding; last Wednesday I was happy to receive a 
number of ‘Gallus’.a If there are difficulties with the editorial board, let me 
know, perhaps I could be of some use to you. 
If the Russian Government is spending money to strengthen its currency, 
that is an infallible sign that a new loan is in the air; the French are the only 
ones who might be tempted; let’s hope they aren’t. But when Russia needs 
gold, she must naturally try to get it! 
Loria will be even more pleas ed when he reads the preface,b he is treated 
there as he deserves and without the least regard for ‘il primo economista 
dell’ Italia’.c 
Young Williamd is behaving admirably. He gets it into his head to combat 
‘subversive tendencies’ 428 ‘and starts by subverting his own government. 429 
Ministers fall like lead soldiers. The poor young man had to keep quiet and 
lie low for over eight months; he can’t  stand it any longer, he blows up—and 
there you are! At a time when we  are winning a quarter of Belgium, 412 when 
electoral reform in Austria is about to send our people into Parliament, when 
in Russia everything is in a state of uncertainty about the future—the young 
man gets it into his head to outdo Crispi and Casimir Périer! You can tell the 
effect this will have in Germany from the fact that at the Frankfurt Congress 
418 the delegates, or at least many of them, called for a new repressive law as 
the best means for the Party to gain ground!

The situation in Austria is interesting. Since the death of his son,a the 
Emperorb has been afraid of the fall of his dynasty in the near future. His heir 
presumptivec is an arrogant imbecile of the utmost unpopularity. The 
Hungarians are not likely to tolerate him, they are demanding personal union 
pure and simple to start with, to be followed by total separation and complete 
independence. To tie his successor’s hands in advance, Francis Joseph is 
trying to strengthen Parliament and ma ke it more genuinely representative. 
That is why he has agreed with hi s friend Taaffe on a fairly extensive 
electoral reform. 270 But Parliament, an assembly of privileged persons, a real 
States General of 1789d (elected by categories: large landowners, commerce, 
towns, rural areas), turns it down, and Taaffe goes out. Thereupon the 
Emperor, like a true constitutional monarch, appoints a Minister from the 
majority,e a coalition of Liberals, Poles, etc., all arch-reactionaries. But he 
makes them promise that in return they  will introduce an electoral reform of 
their own kind and that within a year. The year runs out with all kinds of 
abortive attempts. Thereupon the Empero r puts them in a position to keep 
their word—and that is why for the last 3 weeks Vienna has been talking of 
nothing but electoral reform. But the coalition is incapable of producing 
anything; at the first positive pr oposition they start fighting among 
themselves. So that probably Taaffe w ill shortly replace them and re-table his 
Bill, and if Parliament turns it down he will dissolve it and grant the reform, 
which the Constitution allows him to do. So here you have ‘fellow traveller’ 
Francis Joseph pushing from one side and Victor Adler from the other! But 
what an irony of history that th is Emperor, created in December 1848 
deliberately to crush the Revolution, should be called upon to inaugurate a 
fresh one AG years later!

41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Comrade, 
Many thanks for having translated my Entwicklung des Sozialismus and, 
recently, the Communist Manifestoa into your Armenian mother tongue. 
Unfortunately I am not in a position to comply with your request that I send 
you a short introduction to the latter translation. I cannot very well write 
anything that is to be published in a language which I do not understand. 
Were I to do so as a favour to yourself, I could not refuse to oblige others, in 
which case it might happen that my words were ushered into the world in 
unintentionally, if not deliberately, garbled form, while I might not learn 
about it for years, if ever. 
Then there is another reason—grateful though I am to you for your 
interesting exposé of the Armenian situation—namely, that I do not regard it 
as right or fair to try and express an opinion on matters of which I have not 
acquired a knowledge from personal study. Particularly in this instance when 
the people concerned belong to an oppressed nationality unfortunate enough 
to be trapped between the Scylla of Turkish and the Charybdis of Russian 
despotism, a situation in which Russian Tsarism speculates on playing the 
role of liberator and the servile Russian press never fails to make the most of 
every word uttered in favour of Armenian liberation by turning it to the 
advantage of a Tsarism bent on conquest. 
If, however, I am to tell you honestly what I think, it is this—that 
Armenia’s liberation from the Turks and Russians will become a possibility 
only on the day when Russian Tsarism is overthrown. 
With best wishes for the welfare of your people, 
Yours,

My dear Sir, 
I am in possession of your kind letters 7 and 11 June, 15 October and 12 
November. 
Of Mr. Struve’s works I have only seen the article in Braun’s 
Centralblatt,a and cannot therefore speak as to what assertions he may have 
made. If in my letters you find any facts that may be useful to you in your 
reply, you are welcome to make use of them. 430 But as to any opinions of 
mine, I am afraid, your opponents—not perhaps Mr. Struve but the Russian 
press generally—would use them in a way they do not warrant. I am daily 
and weekly assailed by Russian friends to reply to Russian reviews and 
books in which the words of our authorb are not only misinterpreted but 
misquoted and where they say my interference would suffice to set the 
matter right. I have constantly declin ed doing so, because I cannot, without 
giving up real and serious work, be dr agged into controversies going on in a 
faraway country, in a language which I do not yet read with as much ease as 
the better known western languages, and in  a literature whereof at best I but 
see occasional fragments and where it is  utterly impossible for me to follow 
the debate closely and in all its phases and passages. There are people 
everywhere who, in order to defend a position once taken up by them, do not 
shrink from any distortion or unfair manoeuvre; and if this is the case with 
the writings of our author, I am afraid I should get no better treatment and be 
compelled, finally, to interfere in the debate, both for other people’s sake and 
my own. In fact, if my

opinions as stated in private letters, di d appear in the Russian press with my 
sanction, I should then have no defence via-à-vis my Russian friends here 
and on the Continent, who urge me actively to interfere in Russian debates 
and to set this or that man right on this and that point; I should not have any 
valid reason to decline, as they would be able to tell me: you have already 
once interfered in Russian debates; you must own that our present case is 
quite as important as that of Mr. D., so if you please, treat us as you have 
treated him. And then, my time would be no longer my own, and my 
interference in Russian debates would after all be extremely inefficacious 
and incomplete. 
These are the reasons which compel me, to my very great regret, to request 
you, not to insist on quoting opinions of mine, at least not as mine.  
I will try to forward to you some continuation of what you have already 
received.a 
Yours very truly

Whether Bebel’s conduct in the assembly was inept is open to question. 425 
But in point of fact he was absolutely right. As to editor of the central organ 
you are, of course, bound to cast oil on troubled waters, to argue away even 
what are very real differences, TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT ALL ROUND , and to 
promote unity in the party until th e day the breach comes. Thus as editor you 
may have deplored Bebel’s conduct. But what was displeasing to the editor 
should have been welcome to the party leader, namely the fact that there 
should be men who do not always have to sport an obligatory pair of editor’s 
spectacles upon their noses, and who also remind the editor that, in his 
capacity as party leader, he would do well now and again to view the world 
with the naked eye rather than through rose-tinted spectacles. 
On the very eve of the Frankfurt Pa rty Conference the Bavarians formed 
what was tantamount to a Sonderbund at Nuremberg. 431 They arrived in 
Frankfurt with what was manifestly an ultimatum. To add insult to injury, 
Vollmar spoke of marching separately, while Grilloa declared: ‘Resolve any 
thing you like; we shall not conform.’ They claimed special rights for the 
Bavarians and dubbed their opponents in the party ‘Prussians’ and 
‘Berliners’. They demanded that the grant of supplies be approved, as also an 
agrarian policy which is actually further to the right than that of the petty 
bourgeoisie. Instead of promptly putti ng a spoke in their wheels, as had 
always been done before, the Party Conference did not venture to pass a 
resolution. So if that wasn’t the time for Bebel to speak of the penetration of 
the party by petty-bourgeois elements then I’m at a loss to know when he 
should have done. 
And what did the Vorwärts do? Fasten upon the form of Bebel’s attack, 
say things weren’t so bad after all and place itself in such ‘diametrical 
opposition’ to him that only the—in  the event inevitable—’misunder-
standing’ of Bebel’s opponents forced you to declare that your diametrical 
opposition referred simply to the  form taken by Bebel’s attack, but that, so 
far as its substance was concerned—the matter of supplies and the agrarian 
question—he had been right and you were on his side. 432 I should have 
thought that the mere fact of your having been forced to make this statement 
after the event would have proved to you that you had strayed much further 
to the right than Bebel could have strayed to the left. 
And after all, the whole debate hinged solely upon the two points in which 
the action of the Bavarians culminated, namely, the opportunism 
a Karl Grillenberger

of granting supplies in order to catch the petty bourgeoisie, and the op-
portunism of Vollmar’s agrarian propaganda intended to catch the middle 
and big peasants. These, and the sectarian attitude of the Bavarians were the 
only practical questions under consideration, and if Bebel took them up at the 
point at which the Party Conference had left the Party in the lurch, you ought 
to be grateful to him. If he described the impossible position created by the 
Party Conference as attributable to the growing influence of philistinism in 
the party, he was merely placing a par ticular question in the general context 
in which it belongs, and that is also wort hy of recognition. And if he forced a 
debate on all this, he was only doing wh at absolutely had to be done and 
ensuring that, when confronted by urgent questions, the next Party 
Conference should act in full knowledge of the facts instead of being left 
gaping, as at Frankfurt. 
The danger of a split cannot be laid at the door of Bebel who called a 
spade a spade. It must be laid at the door of the Bavarians who presumed to 
act in a way hitherto unpr ecedented in the party, mu ch to the glee of the 
vulgar democrats on the Frankfurter Zeitung who recognise in Vollmar and 
the Bavarians men of their own stamp,  while the latter rejoice and become 
ever more audacious, 
You say Vollmar is not a traitor. Maybe. Nor do I think he regards himself 
as such. But what would you call a man who asks of a proletarian party that it 
should oblige the Upper Bavarian big and middle peasants, owners of 
anything between ten and thirty hectares, by perpetuating a state of affairs 
based on the exploitation of farm servants and day labourers? A proletarian 
party, expressly founded for the perpetuation of wage slavery! The man may 
be an anti-Semite, a bourgeois democrat, a Bavarian particularist and 
anything else you care to name, but a So cial Democrat? Come to that, in a 
growing workers’ party, the accretion of  petty-bourgeois elements is 
inevitable, nor does it do any harm. Any more than the accretion of 
‘academics’,a failed students, etc. A few years ago they still constituted a 
danger. Now we are able to digest them. But the process of digestion must be 
allowed to run its course. And for this, hydrochloric acid is needed; if there is 
not enough of it (as Frankfurt went to show), we ought to be thankful to 
Bebel for giving us an extra dose, thereby enabling us properly to digest the 
non-proletarian elements. 
For it is in this that the restoration of true harmony in the party con-

Dear Madam, 
May I tender my warmest thanks for the delightful present you were so 
kind as to send me for my birthday? I value it all the more highly, not only 
for being your own handiwork, but also  and above all for your having found 
leisure to do it at a time when you already had enough and more than enough 
to do for the little one that is on its way. For during that self-same time I was 
again afforded an opportunity of seeing, here in my own house, what a 
multitude of cares and preoccupati ons the expectation of motherhood 
involves.b I have all the more reason to pride myself in a present made for 
me at such a time. 
I put it to use at once, on my birthday, when I took a short siesta. One 
sleeps upon it as sweetly as the proverbial ‘quiet conscience’ upon a ‘good 
pillow’. In fact I feel pre tty sure that it would be able to cope without dif-
ficulty even with a pr etty uneasy conscience.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 113 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 4 December 1894  
Dear Sorge, 
Thank you and your wife for your good wishes. Between ourselves, my 
75th year doesn’t hold out quite so much promise as previous ones. True I am 
still nimble enough on my pins, besides having an appetite for work and a 
reasonable capacity for it, but nevertheless I find that stomach upsets and 
colds, which I could once afford to treat with supreme contempt, now 
demand the most respectful treatment. But that is nothing so long as it 
amounts to nothing more. 
Yesterday I sent you three copies of the Preface to Volume II I.a One for 
the luckless Stiebeling who has sent me several specimens of his stuff.b One 
for P. Fireman, D. Phil., if you know or can discover his address. Please give 
the third, after you have done with it, to Schlüter who might be able to put it 
to good use. In about a week’s time at the most I hope to be able to send you 
a copy of the actual book, having been notified that this is on its way. In 
addition today, rolled up and sent Book Post;

wrangling with the Germans, from which they can’t desist. 433 Nearly 
everything the paper says about the triumphs of the Social Democratic 
Federation 44 is a lie; compared with other organisations, especially the 
Independent Labour Party, 114 the Social Democratic Federation is dwindling 
and, if things go on like this, it will soon dwindle into nothingness. 
Unfortunately the Independent Labour Party no longer has a proper paper. 
3. Glühlichter from Vienna and Wahrer Jakob from Stuttgart, so that you 
may acquaint yourself with the ‘wit’ the party has at its disposal. 
4. Bebel’s speech in Berlin and his four articles attacking Grillenberger 
and Vollmar. 434 
The latter is the most interesting of the lot. The Bavarians, who have 
become very, very opportunistic and are already almost an ordinary People’s 
Party (i.e. most of the leaders and many  of the party’s more recent recruits), 
had voted in favour of the general estimates in the Bavarian Landtag, while 
Vollmar, in particular, had begun to agitate on behalf of the peasants so as to 
catch the big peasants of Upper Bavaria—men with 25-80 ACRES of land 
(10-30 hectares) and thus quite unable to manage without wage labour —but 
not their labourers. Having no high hopes of the Frankfurt Party Conference 
418 they organised, a week before the latter, a Bavarian Party Conference of 
their own in the course of which they constituted what amounted to a 
Sonderbund, 431 in as much as they agreed that at Frankfurt the Bavarian 
delegation should, on all questi ons relating to Bavaria, vote as a body and in 
accordance with the Bavari an resolutions previous ly settled upon. So, having 
arrived there, they d eclared that they had had to grant the general estimates 
in Bavaria, there having been no other alternative and that it was, 
furthermore a purely Bavarian question in which no one else had any 
business to poke his nose. In other words, if you resolve anything we 
Bavarians do not like, if you reject our ultimatum, then it will be your fault if 
there’s a split! 
Such was the claim, unprecedented in th e annals of the party, with which 
they confronted the other delegates who were utterly unprepared for it. And 
to such extremes has the clamour for unity been taken in  recent years that, 
having regard to the influx of as yet insufficiently trained elements during 
the same period, it is small wonder that  this attitude, incompatible as it is 
with the party’s continued existence, should have got by without the 
peremptory rebuff it deserved, and that  no resolution should have been taken 
on the question of supplies.

Now let us suppose the Prussians, who are in the majority at the Party 
Conference, were also to hold a preliminary congress and were to pass 
resolutions there on, say, the attitude of the Bavarians—resolutions binding 
upon all the Prussian delegates so that the whole lot, both the majority and 
the minority, voted as a body for those resolutions at the General Party 
Conference, what would be the good of holding General Party Conferences 
at all? And what would the Bavarians sa y if the Prussians were to do exactly 
what they themselves have just done? 
In short, the matter could not be allowed to rest at that, and it was now that 
Bebel stepped into the breach. He simply  put the question back on the agenda 
and it is now being debated. Bebel is by far the most lucid and far-sighted 
man of the lot. 
I have been corresponding with him regularly for some fifteen years and 
we see eye to eye about almost everything. Liebknecht, on the other hand, is 
very hidebound in his outlook and the old democrat of South German-
federalist, particularist complexion in him is forever coming to the surface. 
Worse still, he cannot tolerate the fact  that Bebel, who has long since out-
grown him, refuses to submit to hi s guidance although he puts up willingly 
with his presence at his side. Furthermore, so badly has he managed the 
central organ, the Vorwärts —mainly because of the jealousy with which he 
guards his LEADERSHIP , wanting to direct everything and in fact directing 
nothing, i.e. placing obstacles everywhere—that the paper, which could be 
the best in Berlin, serves only to provide the party with profits amounting to 
50,000 marks but no political influen ce whatsoever. Needless to say, 
Liebknecht is now intent on acting as mediator and pours scorn on Bebel, but 
in my view, it’s the latter who will turn out to be right. In Berlin the 
Executive and the best of our chaps ar e already taking his side and I am 
convinced that, if he appeals to the part y at large, he will get a big majority. 
Meanwhile we must wait and see. I would also send you the Vollmariad, etc., 
but have only got one copy of the same for my own use. 
Louise and the baby both well. 
Warm regards to you and your wife. I trust your eyes will soon be better 
again, as also your other infirmities.

My dear Turati, 
Where the deuce do you find the patience to keep writing to this dear 
Monsieur E.? But let’s leave aside the bourgeois titles. As to your students, I 
regret infinitely that I am unable to come to their aid other than by giving 
them my best wishes. 435 My time is so occupied that I cannot get down even 
to the most urgent matters at hand. Th e same day as I receive your card, one 
addresses the same request to me on behalf of Berlin students; I am obliged 
to send them the same refusal as I do to your friends. These little things are 
but trifles if taken separately, yet when all this happens day after day with a 
desperate regularity, it all adds up to a considerable loss of time. Be so kind 
as to make my excuses to your young friends to whom, nevertheless, I wish 
complete success. 
I enclose my preface to the 3d volume of Capital for the benefit of 
citizeness Anna—there are several lines in which one might become in-
terested in Italy. 
It was good of you to cite Bebel in the Critica Sociale. 425 Bebel has said 
bitter, but quite necessary truths. This was more opportune than the op-
portunism of his adversaries. 
Yours truly, 
F. E.

Dear Sorge, 
Today one copy of Marx’s Capital, Vol. II I, has gone off to you by reg-
istered Book Post. I trust you will get it. 
‘What has earned us such an undeserved stroke of luck as the ‘lese-
majestie’ suit brought at little Willie’sa behest against our chaps for having 
remained seated in the Reichstag, is beyond my comprehension. 436 No one 
could have done us a greater servi ce. Little Willie and ‘Mr von Kö ller, 
Whatever they do there’s worse to foller’ are a fine pair and as if cut out to 
get everything into a mess and us—out of it. 
Bebel has emerged victorious. In th e first place, after Bebel’s articles 
Vollmar broke off the controversy, 434 in the second, his appeal to the 
Executive was most resolutely rejected and, in the third, he appealed to the 
parliamentary group but the latter, having been declared incompetent by 
Bebel, admitted its incompetence, which means that the matter will come up 
before the next Party Conference, when Bebel can be certain of a majority of 
two-thirds or three-quarters. 
It is the third campaign Vollmar ha s fought for a leading position in the 
party outside of Bavaria. On the firs t occasion he demanded that we should 
actively support Caprivi and become government socialists. 437 On the 
second, that we should go in for state socialism and assist the present 
German Empire in its socialist experiments. 438 On both he got a flea in his 
ear. And now he has got another.

mind that I can no longer, in my seventy-fifth year, permit myself those 
imprudences you reprehend. On the contrary, I am on the strictest of diets, 
treat my alimentary canal like a gr umpy bureaucratic chief whose every 
whim must be obeyed and, to ward o ff coughs, bronchial catarrh and the like, 
submit to being wrapped up, kept warm  and generally maltreated in every 
conceivable way, as is only meet and right for a decrepit old man. But 
enough of that. 
I need hardly tell you how pleased I was about the resolute stand Bebel 
adopted after the feeble Party Conference. 425 I was also pleased to have been 
indirectly compelled by Vollmar to throw in a word or two on this account.a 
We have in fact been victorious all along the line. First, Vollmar’s exit from 
the lists after Bebel’s four articles 434 in itself an unequivocal retreat, then the 
rebuff administered by the Executive; then the repudiation by the par-
liamentary group of the claim that it, rather than the Party Conference, 
should act as arbiter. I.e. Vollmar has suffered defeat after defeat in this, his 
third unsuccessful campaign. That should suffice even an erstwhile papal 
Zouave. 439 I have written Liebknecht two letters about this,b from which he 
will have derived little pleasure. The man is becoming ever more obstructive. 
He still claims to have the best nerves in the party—no great shakes, to go by 
his rotten speech in the Reichs tag the day before yesterday. 440 Nor, it seems, 
has this gone unnoticed in government circles where an attempt is clearly 
being made to help him ont o his legs again by accusi ng him of lese -majestie, 
436 allegedly committed a posteriori.  
That affair proves, by the way, either that Williamc and von Köller are 
completely crazy or that they are deliberately trying to engineer a coup 
d’état. Hohenlohe’s speech has demonstrat ed that he is an utterly gormless,d 
feeble-minded, weak-willed old gentle man, and nothing but Mr von Köllers 
man of straw. Köller himself is a typical Junker—vain, forceful and narrow-
minded, and is capable of presenting himself to Little Willie as the man who 
will put paid to ‘subversion’ and carry out to the very letter His Majesty’s 
intentions with regard to the restoration of the royal prerogative. And 
William is capable of saying in reply: ‘You are a man after my own heart!’ If 
that’s how matters stand—and every day brings fresh indications that it is—
then vogue la galere!e We’ll be in for a merry time.

But now for the most important thing. You express surprise at not having 
heard from Louise. In which case, might I suggest that you be so good as to 
answer the extremely urgent letters she has written to you, not only those 
about her acting as correspondent for you over here and whether you would 
also like articles from anyone else and, if so, who—but also and above all 
those about the offer of money. 
Months ago, in September or early October, she wrote to you saying: 
‘There is now a group of people who, though not members of the party, 
nevertheless have confidence in you and in particular believe that you are the 
man to help the daily Arbeiter-Zeitung 377 along the road to financial success 
as well, always providing that you are gi ven the leading position.’ They are 
therefore prepared to assign to y ou a considerable sum for the daily Arbeiter-
Zeitung —amounting, I understand, to so me 5,000 fl., on condition that: 
1. You accept the senior position on the paper. 
2. The thing is treated purely as a business investment and interest is 
regularly paid. 
3. All negotiations, payments, etc., are dealt with by you in Vienna and by 
Louise over here. 
These, to the best of my recollection, were the conditions upon which the 
offer was made. ‘Well, there has been no response of any kind from you, 
either to the above or to any of Louise’s subsequent letters. Last week she 
wrote again, asking for an immediate reply which had to be here by Tuesday, 
the 11th, at the latest. In vain. Now this can only mean one of two things: 
Either you in your correspondence are so enmeshed in a web of postal and 
other kinds of intrigue that it is virtually impossible to get a letter to you, or 
your disinclination to answer letters is such that you would rather forego the 
money that has been offered you than write to Louise. 
Either way we have got to know where we stand. The chaps are pressing 
for a decision for, if you refuse the money, they will invest it elsewhere. We 
have therefore been compelled to send this letter to Mrs Anna Pernerstorfer, 
with the request that she deliver it to you in person and to no one else. We 
would now ask you— -for the very last time —if you would kindly let us know 
whether or not you wish to negotiate with us and or Louise regarding the 
money. If you do, you must tell her how letters are to be addressed to you, 
whereupon we shall send a reply by ‘registered’ mail.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
[London,] 17 December 1894 
 
My dear Löhr, 
You say, after finishing the 3rd volumea and before beginning with the 4th, 
I must long for a little rest. Now I w ill just tell you what my position is. 
I have to follow the movement in five large and a lot of small European 
countries and the U. S. America. For that purpose I receive 3 German, 
2 English, 1 Italian dailies and from January 1 the Vienna daily, 7 in all. 
Of weeklies I receive 2 from Germany, 7 Austria, 1 France, 3 America (2 
English, 1 German), 2 Italian, and 1 each in Polish, Bulgarian, Spanish 
and Bohemian, three of which in la nguages I am still gradually acquiring. 
Besides that, calls of the most varied sorts of people (just now, a few min 
utes ago, Polak from Amsterdam sent me a German sculptor penniless 
and in want of employment) and an ever increasing crowd of correspon 
dents, more than at the time of the International! many of whom expect 
long explanations and all of them taking away time. With all this and the 
3rd volume, I have not, even during the proof-sheet-time, that is the whole 
of 1894, been able to read more than one book.  
Now the next thing is the publication of Lassalle’s letters to Mohr. 284 
Tussy has typed them, they are in my desk, but—thanks to the removal—I 
have not been able to touch them. That means notes, references to facts long 
gone by as well as to my own old correspondence with Mohr— and a 
preface to be written diplomatically. 
Then the heaps of arrears of my own.  First the complete rewriting of the 
Bauernkrieg 235 which has been out of sale for years, and has been promised 
as my first work after Vol. II I. That requires a considerable study; I hoped to 
do that along with the proof-sheets, But impossible. Anyhow I shall have to 
look myself up how to do it. 
Then—not to speak of other little jobs hanging over me—I want to write 
at least the chief chapters out of Mohr’s political life: 1842-1852, 
a of Capital  
=====第413页=====
Letters- 1894 387 
and the International. The latter is the most important and urgent, I intend to 
do it first. But that requires freedom from interruption, and when shall I get 
that? 316 
All these things are wanted from me, and moreover a re-edition of Mohr’s 
and my own earlier smaller writings. For that I have been collecting; but have 
not succeeded in much—. Some  more bits are in the Parteiarchiv in Berlin. 
442 But a good deal is short yet, for instance a copy of the first Rheinische 
Zeitung. If I could get, say 2/3 of the old 1842-50 articles collected, I should 
start, as I am sure then that for a 2nd edition a lot more would come to light. 
But we are not so far advanced as yet. 
And then Vol. 4. 443 Now of that there is a very rough manuscript, of which 
up to now it in impossible to say how much can be used. I myself cannot 
again undertake to unravel it and dictate the whole as I did Vol. 2 and 3. My 
eyesight would break down completely before I was half through. I found 
that out years ago and tried another dodge . I considered it would be useful to 
have one or two intelligent men of th e younger generation broken in to read 
Mohr’s handwriting. I thought of Kautsky and Bernstein. Kautsky was then 
still in London (some 6 or 7 years ago). I asked him and he assented; I said I 
would pay one hundred pounds for the complete ‘fair copy’ of what there is, 
and assist him where he could not deci pher. He began. Then he left London, 
took one Hefta with him, and for years I heard no more, He was too busy with 
the Neue Zeit, so I had Manuscript and copy returned, as far as the latter 
went—perhaps 1/8 to 1/6 of the whole.b Bernstein too is not only very busy, 
but suffers from overwork, has not yet completely overcome his 
neurasthenia, and I hardly dare ask him. I shall see whether Tussy will; if he 
volunteers, all well; if not I do not intend to run the risk of having it said that 
I brought on a relapse of his illne ss by overloading him with work. 
That is my position: 74 years the which I am beginning to feel, and work 
enough for two men of 40. Yes, if I could divide myself into the F. E. of 40 
and the F. E. of 34, which would just be 74, then we shoul d soon be all right. 
But as it is, all I can do is to work on with what is before me and get through 
it as far and as well as I can. 
Now you know my position, and if you have now and then to wait for a 
letter from me, you will know the reason why.

always happens. I have found one mo re copy which I will send to you

Meissner supplied me, and still supplies me, after he has supplied everyone 
else. I am also sending you a copy for Deville.  
As I said: the (Nantes) programme 406 itself has only one pointless clause: 
the reduction of LEGAL rates of interest, i.e., the revival of the ancient laws 
against usury whose total uselessness was demonstrated 2,000 years ago. 
You cannot effectively reduce the rates of interest paid by mortgaged 
peasants without turning all mortgages on property into debts against the 
State, in which case you are free to re duce the interest—except that you lose 
money yourself, when it falls due. And also the clause on hunting, as it is 
drafted, is self-contradictory. 
Not only is young Williamc cracked, but this time he is pushing things to a 
crisis. The new chancellord is simply a man of straw, the moving spirit in the 
new government is Köller ( der macht as immer döller,e as Kladderadatsch 
said of him years ago). They are provoking a conflict with the Reichstag. 
They are going to prosecute Liebknecht for lese-majesty after the closure. 436 
They are pressing for a dissolution whic h will mean a recalcitrant Reichstag 
in Berlin and then—a little coup d’état . We may look forward to some nice 
happenings in Germany if everything turns out as these gentlemen visualise. 
In Italy, too, the monarchy is hard pressed. The Crown Princef is involved 
in the Banca Romana to the tune of 300,000 francs, the Kingg in the name of 
various nominees, for very much larger amounts. All that is well known. 
Crispi is mortally wounded by Giolitti’s sensational move 445—the whole of 
Parliament as well as all the higher o fficials are compromised by it, and in 
simple-minded Italy they are still so Catholic, that is to say, pagan, that all 
this is done in broad daylight and there is no means of concealing the 
corruption, of which, on the contrary, they boast—until there is a crisis. 
And then, Russia—the unknown, where only one thing is certain: that the 
present regime will not be able to stand a change of tsar, and there will be a 
crisis there too. 
What you say about the effect pr oduced by the little scene in the 
Reichstag goes for England as well. All the years of work, all the electoral 
and real victories count for nothing; a little melodramatic scene—that is

I shall write to Adler about your letters. But there, with the small working 
strength they have, it seems to me very unlikely that a regular

London, 22 December 1894  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
Dear Victor, 
So the offer of moneya has at last reached the stage at which we can get 
down to business. Louise will be letting you have further details. 
As regards correspondents over here, please give M. Beer a pseudonym 
that will so distinguish him from all the other correspondents as to obviate 
any possibility of confusion. The man is very green so far as England is 
concerned and sees things through Galician-Talmudic spectacles.—I hardly 
imagine that E. Bernstein will be able to send you a great deal; as it is, he 
seldom has much time to spare for articles for the Vorwärts and prefers to 
work for the Neue Zeit.  
Lafargue has asked whether you could make use of him as a contributor. I 
told him that in the first instance you would have to consider Frankel but that 
I was unaware of all the circumstances and would write.b He—Lafargue—is 
a lively and interesting writer but his stuff, like the Gallus reports he sends to 
the Vorwärts, is all in French. His wife does not write German either and 
speaks it only on fairly rare occasions. No r is she as fluent as Tussy. I don’t 
know whether it would be convenient for you to do the translating over there 
yourselves. Lafargue would naturally have a fee in mind, since he has lost his 
deputy’s salary. I couldn’t tell him anything about that either. 
Things are getting complicated on the Continent. In your country electoral 
reform is assured—and nowadays, when something like that gets under way, 
it is not so easy to stop—while Russia is seeing the beginning of the end of 
Tsarist omnipotence, for it is improbable that autocracy will survive this 
latest change of monarch; in Italy they are heading straight for a revolution 
that may cost the monarchy its head, and in the German Empire Little Williec 
seems intent on crossing the Halys and destroying a great empire. You could 
hardly wish for a better moment at which to found a daily newspaper—
material in plenty and what’s more, of a kind

Thanks for your news of the 23rd about the Allemanists 21 and their

movement are concerned. I hope the w hole set of Allemanists will soon be

you work out some sort of preface out of the four German ones, giving such 
information about the fates of the work as may interest your readers, then 
send me the Manuscript for additions to be proposed by me (I have just 
received an Armenian translationa) to which I might add a few words in my 
own name. 450 Don’t you think that would solve the difficulty? 
Last Sunday Tussy being in Manchester sent me your letter to her about 
Vol. IV. 443 I am quite willing and shall be glad to assist her if she will 
undertake the work of writing out  the original Manuscript. 
As to what you say about Mohr’s papers and their treatment in case of my 
death, the matter is simple enough. All these things I hold in trust for you, 
that you know; and consequently on my death they revert to you. In the last 
will I made (when Sam Moore was here last time but one) there is no special 
provision, but in the instructions to my executors accompan ying it, there is a 
distinct direction to them, to hand over to Tussy, as the administrator of the 
will, the whole of Mohr’s Manuscripts that are in his own handwriting, also 
all letters addressed to him with the sole exception of my own 
correspondence with him.b And as Tussy seems to have some doubt about the 
matter, I shall as soon as Sam Moore comes back in Summer ask him to draw 
up a new will in which this is distinctly and unmistakably declared. If you 
have any other wish please let me know. 
Adler writes about Paul’s correspondence for the daily Arbeiter Zeitung: 
‘was Lafargue anlangt so habe ich nichts gegen französische 
Korrespondenzen, ich werde viel übersetzen müssen. Natürlich wird Frankel 
regelmässig schreiben—Lafargue ist ein Korrespondent wie ich es für den 
Vorwärts bin, selten, aber dann lang. Nun wäre mir ja mit seinen 
geistsprühenden Artikeln sehr gedient, wenn ich nicht fürchtete dass er mir 
dieselben schickt wie an Vorwärts und Echo.c Kannst Du arrangieren dass er 
mir etwa zweimal im Monat oder bei besondern Anlässen schreibt, so wäre es 
mir ein grosser Gefallen, wir können nur nicht viel zahlen, 20 fr. für den 
Artikel müsste ihm genügen.’d

Lafargue, I have nothing against French correspondence, I shall have a lot to translate. Naturally 
Frankel will write regularly—Lafargue is a correspondent of the kind that I am for Vorwärts,

were not afraid that he would send me the same as those for Vorwärts and Echo. Can you 
arrange for him to write for me, say twice a month or on special occasions; that would be a great 
help to me, only we cannot pay much, he would have to make do with 20 francs an article.’

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 
IN HANOVER 
London, 1 January 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Kugelmann, 
I am most grateful to you, your wife and your daughter for your kind good 
wishes which I sincerely reciprocate. But now we had better get down to 
business straight away, as I am overwhelmed with correspondence, etc. 453 
If I understood you aright, the collection in America was mainly to do 
with Marx’s articles in the Tribune. I have two collections of these over here, 
of which one at any rate is incomplete and probably both, since the Tribune 
also published Marx’s articles as unsigned leaders. A third collection could 
therefore only be of use to me for the purpose of completing the set and that 
was why I suggested at the time that it should be temporarily housed in the 
archives where I could always have access to it when necessary. 
But you now speak of earlier things, i.e. stuff from the period up till 1851, 
and that, of course, is quite a differe nt matter and not what I had understood 
you to say in Berlin. 454 These things are in fact of  the utmost value and it is 
only the lack of them that has prevented me from bringing out a complete 
edition of these lesser works as well as of the articles by Marx and myself 
that appeared between 1842 and 1852. It has long been my wish to publish 
these things, once I am in some sort of a position to do so and if, therefore, 
you can place as many of them as po ssible at my disposal, you will be 
making your own contribution towards that end. In which case I shall resume 
my search for a copy of the Rheinische Zeitung of 1842, chiefly with regard 
to Marx’s articles. 
Please tell me again where the collection originated and, if you cannot at 
once get hold of the things themselves, kindly procure for me, if possible, a 
list of the books, periodicals, etc., contained therein, but excluding the 
Tribune articles. 455

but Mrs Freyberger. Her husband is an extremely able young Viennese 
doctor, formerly Nothnagel’s assistant, who fell out with the faculty over 
there because he gave lectures on pr actical anatomy to working men and 
explained to them the social causes of  their ailments. He is now addressing 
himself to the higher realms of applied medicine in this country and will, I do 
not doubt, soon make a success of it, for he is far more knowledgeable than 
most Englishmen. In order that my domestic arrangements should not be 
revolutionised more than necessary, we have taken a larger house in the same 
road where all three’ or rather four, of us (there having been the addition of a 
little girl seven weeks ago) live together.

and business correspondence has virtua lly precluded my attending to my 
private correspondence, something from which Sorge has also had to suffer. 
You will have heard from him that Louise Kautsky is now Mrs Freyberger 
and the mother of a strong and healthy little girl and that we have all moved 
to 41, Regent’s Park Road. 
As Sorge will have told you, I have sent you a copy of Volume II I of 
Capital addressed to the Volkszeitung, as I didn’t know whether your 
Hoboken address still held good. At all events the Volkszeitung seemed safer 
to me. I could not, however, pass on your commission to Ede, he having long 
since been engaged for the same purpose by the Neue Zeit. 457 I ought really 
to have advised you of th is—please accept my apologies. 
Over here things are much the same as with you. Amongst the masses the 
socialist instinct is becoming ever stronger, but whenever it behoves them to 
translate their instinctive impulses into  clear ideas and demands, the chaps at 
once go their several ways, some to the Social Democratic Federation, 44 
others to the Independent Labor Party, 114 while the rest stay put in the 
Independent Labour Party, Tr ades Unions Organization etc., etc. In short, not 
a party but so many sects. The leaders ar e nearly all of them pretty unreliable 
fellows, while the candidates for the supreme leadership, though thick on the 
ground, are by no means eminently fitted for the post. At the same time we 
have the two big bourgeois parties who are standing by, purse in hand, to see 
whom they can buy. Moreover, what is known as ‘democracy’ over here is 
much restricted by indirect barriers. Periodicals are shockingly expensive, 
ditto candidatures for Parliament, ditto life as a Member of Parliament—if 
only on account of the vast correspondence this entails. To revise the 
deplorably kept registers of electors also costs a great deal of money and 
hitherto none but the two official parties have been able to defray that cost. 
Hence it is unlikely that anyone who does not support either of those parties 
will appear on the register. People over here are far behind the Continent in 
all these matters and, what’s more, they are beginning to notice it; again, 
there is no second ballot, a relative majority or, as you Americans would say, 
PLURALITY , being enough. It is a situation in which everything is organised 
on the basis of only two parties and, until a third party is strong enough to be 
a match for them, the most it will be able to do is turn the scales. In the same 
way there is little likelihood of the Tr ades Unions over here bringing off 
something on the lines of the Berlin beer boycott 458—a court of arbitration 
such as was secured over

there is something that is s till unattainable in this country. 
On the other hand—as in the case of America—once the workers over 
here know what they want, the state, the land, industry and everything else 
will be theirs. 
This is intended for you alone, not for the Volkszeitung. Louise sends her 
kindest regards and both of us wish you a very Happy New Year.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 3 January 1895 
 
Dear Baron, 
Firstly, a very Happy New Year from one household to the other, and, 
secondly, my thanks for the amusing report of the MARE ’S NEST discovered 
by Liebknecht. Hardly had I read the first couple of lines of your account 
than I realised that it could only refer to the old business with Schweitzer and 
for me that gave twice the savour to the humour of the situation. 459 
Incidentally it will be sufficient if you make a note in your own copy of the 
variations of the original from the printed text and let me have them some 
time or other for insertion in mine. I would rather not enter into 
correspondence with Liebknecht about the copyright of the original ms., for it 
is improbable that it would get us anywhere. 
Parts of Fireman’s articlea are, I agree, rendered so complex by his mis-

guided incursions into other aspects of Marx’s theory and by all manner of 
metaphysical, i.e. anti-dialectical divagati ons, as virtually to conceal the fact 
that, by a happy chance, he has been able  to get closer than anyone else to 
the crux of the problem. Hence the total ineffectuality of the article. Only 
someone who gives his undivided attention to the specific problem under 
discussion will make the discovery that here is something which, if pursued, 
will lead to the solution of the whole problem. 
It would seem that you will be having a thoroughly lively year in 
Germany. If Mr von Köller carries on in this way, 460 no thing is impos-
sible—conflict, dissolution, granting concessions, coup d’état. Obviously he 
would also be content with less. The Junkers would be happy enough with 
more generous douceurs, but to obtain these he will have to appeal to certain 
cravings for personal domination and pander to them to the point at which 
elements of resistance are also brought into play, and it is here that chance—
i.e. what is involuntary, incalculable—comes into play. And to secure those 
douceurs he will have to raise the spectre of conflict—if he goes a step 
further, the original aim, the douceur,  will become of secondary importance 
and then it will be a case of Crown versus Reichstag, of bend or break, and 
that’s when the fun may begin. At the moment I am reading Gardiner’s 
Personal Government of Charlesa in which the parallels with present-day 
Germany are so close as to be almost absurd. As, for instance, the arguments 
over immunity from the consequences of actions performed in Parliament. 
Were Germany a Latin country, a revolutionary conflict would be inevitable, 
but as it is, you can’t be certain about nowt, as Jollymeiera used to say. 
Meanwhile the business of the peasants has quietly fizzled out, though 
August’s attack was most meritorious nevertheless and made good much of 
which had been omitted at Frankfurt. 425 
The worthy Bavarian socialists who favour reserved rights will be in no 
hurry to burn their fingers again. 
Amongst the various small factions over here things are, for the moment, 
jogging along in the usual dilatory way. Though their mutual squabbles are 
no longer so heated, the intrigues behind the scenes are being conducted with 
proportionately greater zeal. The masses,  on the other hand, who are being 
instinctively drawn towards socialism, are experiencing a growing urge for 
conscious and unified action. Though less

clear-sighted than individua l leaders, the masses are certainly far better than 
the leaders as a whole, yet the process of acquiring consciousness is slower 
than elsewhere, since pretty well all the old leaders also have an interest in 
diverting this burgeoning consciousness in to one specific channel or another, 
or, to put it crudely, in vitiating it. Well, one must just be patient. 
So once again a Happy New Year and many regards.

ENGELS TO LUDWIG SCHORLEMMER 
IN DARMSTADT 
London, 3 January 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
Dear Schorlemmer, 
I have not yet thanked you for your  kind good wishes on my birthday and 
for your New Year’s card, my re sponse in each case being a resounding 
Happy New Year. 
Here, too, all manner of changes have  since taken place. At the beginning 
of last year Mrs Kautsky married Dr Freyberger, a young Viennese physician 
resident in this country, and we decide d that, as we all wanted to remain 
together, we should take a larger house, one such being available close by. 
Hardly had we moved in and got things in order than Mrs Freyberger was 
delivered of a baby girl; mother and child are fit and well. Last summer 
Pumps and family also returned to London. Her husband’sa

business in the Isle of Wight was not doing particularly well and he therefore 
wants to try his luck again here. 
Carl’s book Rise and Progress 313 was also sent to me not long ago. 
Volume I (re-edited by two young chemistsa) of the big text-book published 
in collaboration with Roscoe has come out. 311 In view of the usual terms 
governing payment for such works, it is unlikely that Carl’s heirs will 
receive much, if anything at all. 
Even though the Party Conference in Frankfurt 418 proved a somewhat 
feeble affair by comparison with its  predecessors, mainly because Vollmar 
and the Bavarians literally caught th e other deputies napping with their 
Bavarian ultimatum,b while the latter, fearing the possibility of a split, failed 
to reach a decision on the most impor tant issues, the stupidity of our 
opponents will nevertheless help us overc ome all these little tribulations. Not 
content with the Subversion Bill, 428 those men of genius must needs institute 
proceedings against Liebknecht on acc ount of a spot of bother in the 
Reichstag, 436 i.e. actually make us the champions of the constitutional rights 
of the Reichstag! And it was precisely this new conflict that provided us with 
the opportunity of bringing the Berlin beer boycott to a victorious conclusion, 
458 a victory which has made a great impression abroad and especially here in 
England, For despite their seventy years of publicly organised trade clubs and 
considerable freedom of association, the workers over here are very far from 
securing the kind of court of arbitration that was successfully fought for in 
Berlin. In the words of one paper: 
‘Kaiser William would do well to reflect on the fact that the men who 
have got the better of a beer barrel will also get the better of a sceptre.’ 
And that was our doing. In Germany there are now only two people whose 
speeches command general attention—the Kaiser William and August Bebel. 
His last speech was brilliant, but it must be read in the or iginal transcript. 461 
Though I am again in good health, I realise, of course, that 74 isn’t 47 and 
that I can no longer make so free with food, drink, etc. Nor am I as hardy as 
in the past. But I am nevertheless still perfectly robust for my age and trust I 
shall live to see this and that, especially if, as seems distinctly probable, the 
gentlemen in Berlin decide to engage in a slight tussle with the Constitution.

about a situation in which the Social Democrats will be compelled to act as 
the defenders of the Imperial Constitu tion against a body of Junkers who not 
only infringe that Constitution but are in tent on staging a coup d’état. That 
will suit us admirably. Let’s have at ‘em. Many regards from

IN MAINZ 
London, 3 January 1895

Dear Old Man, 
As you see, I reciprocate your congratulations on the completion of my 
74th year (you were kind enough to make me a year younger (than I am) with 
a resounding Happy New Year. Let us hope that, come the next one, we shall 
both of us still be hale and hearty; for I have a great desire just to take one 
peek into the new century, though by the first of January 1901 or thereabouts, 
I shall be a complete wreck, and then let happen what may. 
I was not unduly disturbed about the row in the party. 463 It is much better 
that things of this kind should crop up from time to time and be properly 
thrashed out than that people should don their nightcaps. For the very fact 
that the party has steadily and inexorably grown and expanded has meant 
that the new elements are more difficu lt to absorb than their predecessors. 
The working men of the big cities, i.e. the most intelligent and wideawake, 
are already ours and what we are now getting are either the working men of 
the small towns and rural areas, or stude nts, salesmen, etc., or again, those 
struggling to keep their heads above water,

the petty bourgeois and such  independent craftsmen as still own or rent a 
parcel of land, and now, into the bargain, the small peasant proper. And since 
our party is in fact the only really progressive party and, what is more, the 
only one strong enough to ensure that advances are made, it is obviously 
tempting to bring a little socialism to bear on the debt-ridden and near-
rebellious middle and big peasants as well, particularly in districts where 
such people predominate on the land. That might well involve going beyond 
the limits of what is allowed on principle by our party, in which case there 
will be a bit of a fracas, but so sound is our party’s constitution that no harm 
will have been done. No one is so stupi d as seriously to envisage a break 
with the great majority of the party, nor is anyone so conceited as to believe 
himself able to set up, alongside our big party, a small private one, like the 
Swabian People’s Party 464 which has actually succeeded in swelling its 
numbers from seven to eleven Swabians. All this quarrelling has served only 
to disappoint the bourgeois who, for twenty years now, have been regularly 
counting on there being a split, while at the same time ensuring that there 
should not be the slightest risk of one. Take, for instance, the present 
Subversion Bill 428 and Liebknecht’s elevation to the status of representative 
of the rights of the Reichstag and of the Imperial Constitution, 436 likewise 
the threatened coup d’état and infringement of the law by the powers that be. 
Of course stupidities are committed on our side also, but to render it possible 
for opponents such as these to get the bette r of us, we should have to be of a 
stupidity so abysmal as to be without rival anywhere else in the world today. 
Otherwise your idea of giving the younger generation a chance to take the 
helm in the party and thus get itself into a fix would not be at all bad; but I 
believe that they will acquire experi ence and common sense even without an 
experiment of that kind. 
As you can see from my address, I have, as we used to say, moved a few 
doors along. This house is much better and more convenient and is very 
close to the park entrance. 
I hope that the ‘Heilig Geist’ wher e we downed a good few glasses in our 
time, is still flourishing. 465 I should like to cool off on some hot summer’s 
day in its Gothic vaults. But who knows what may not happen? One should 
never say die. 
Well, once again a Happy New Year and warm regards from 
Yours

Dear Friend, 
I have had your various letters of 6 Sep., 16 Dec. and the 1st of this month 
and have passed on your message to Aveling. 466 
Many thanks for the trouble you have been to over the pr eface to the third 
volume of Capital. It in quite a good thing that it should come out in the 
Rassegna 467 since it will enable people in Italy to see that abroad Loria’s 
spurious greatness is viewed in a very different light from what it is at home. 
On the other hand I can understand that at present Turati should consider it 
better tactics not to attack the man as vehemently as I do.a When we had the 
exceptional laws 15 to contend with in Germany, our tactics were different in 
many respects, and individual opponents whom we have since mercilessly 
attacked were temporarily spared for one  reason or another. In cases such as 
these I must rely to a very large extent on the judgement of men who, like 
Turati, are in the thick of the fray; those men may not always do what I, from 
my standpoint over here, would consider best or most important, but 
nevertheless they are doing something, are doing their duty to the best of 
their knowledge, and are prepared to take the consequences. If the 
government didn’t find Turati and his Milan friends exceedingly 
objectionable, it would not have put them under domicilio coattob for three 
months or five.

Admittedly neither of the two chapters of the third volume of Capital 
solves the kind of question relating to the theory of value that might be raised 
by any old bourgeois economist. There is nothing of the sort in one chapter 
or the other of the book. But those aspects of the subject that could not be 
developed in Volume I are elucidated in Parts 1-4 of Volume II I. 
Two or three copies of your transl ation of the preface will amply suffice 
me.

Dear Victor, 
My only real reason for writing to you today is to advise you that on 
Sunday eveninga Louise sent off in a wrapper a ms. containing three items 
addressed to the Editor, Arbeiter-Zeitung, 10 Schwarzspanierstrasse; these 
contain: 
1. Something about the cotton industry.

Letters- 1895 409 
2. Something about the activities of the Parliamentary Committee of the 
Trades Union Congress 28 (already to some extent anticipated in the A rbeiter-
Zeitu ng)  
3. An extract from Mrs Crawford’s Paris Correspondence. 469 As you have 
previously had trouble over manuscripts sent in a wrapper, I believe this 
notification to be pertinent. 
Should another attempt be made to charge you excess postage after the 
event on the pretext that th e package has been handled as a letter, it will be 
high time to lodge a complaint. According to the official excerpt (cited in 
inverted commas) in the E nglish Post Office Guide, ‘ MANUSCRIPT OF BOOKS 
OR OTHER LITERARY PRODUCTIONS’ may be sent in a wrapper at a cost of a 
ha’penny for two ounces anywhere within the area covered by the 
International Postal Union. It must surely be possible to get this enforced in 
Austria too, or is the Arbeiter-Zeitung prepared of its own free will to pay a 
surcharge at twenty times the proper rate 2 1/2 for a  1/2 oz)? 
Another thing. From Russia we hear  that the December issue of the 
European Messenger (Vestnik Yevropy)a contained an article on Alexander II 
I of extreme and, indeed—censorship in that country being what it is—
unprecedented acerbity. Since your wifeb has a perfect command of Russian, 
might it not be worth your while to have a look at and, perhaps, make use of 
it? It really would be a capital joke if the Arbeiter-Zeitung were also to steal a 
march on the bourgeois press in this particular field. 
Up till now, Nos 1 and 3-8 of the Arbeiter-Zeitung have arrived here, all of 
them addressed to Ludwig Freyberger, as well as a copy of No. 1 addressed 
in your hand to myself. So far as the arrangement of the material is 
concerned, the change-over from a twice-weekly to a daily paper 377 is not yet 
quite complete, but one can see that it is under way and that the Thursday 
evening and Sunday numbers are distinct from the others in that each has its 
own particular character to suit a particular reading public. That you should 
not at present have time to spare for leading articles is understandable; Marx 
fared likewise with the Neue Rheinische Zeitung —in the entire first month 
only two were by him, and throughout the whole of the first quarter five, if 
that. At the outset the editor-in-chief is kept busy enough organising the 
thing, than which nothing is

more important, All in all, the paper has turned out very well considering this 
is its first week; such shortcomings as it has will all be overcome in the end.  
We gave your message to Vandervelde on 1.1., when he called in here for 
a moment. 470 
I have passed on to Laura as much as was necessary of your lettera but 
have heard nothing about this since. Perhaps Lafargue has written to you 
direct. 
I cannot supply you with very much material on ‘Marx in Vienna in 1848’. 
Some time I shall search through the Neue Rheinische Zeitung for facts and 
also see if I can find anything more about Becher. 471 Our Vienna 
correspondent was one Müller-Tellering from Koblenz, like all Koblenzers, 
fanatical and an inveterate trouble-maker. After returning to Germany at the 
end of 1849, he first came to Cologne and picked a quarrel with red Becker.b 
His next port of call was London where he promptly fell out with us over a 
trifling personal matter (which, with a little less contrariness on his part, 
could have been settled in a few mi nutes’ conversation) and instantly 
produced a pamphlet, Vergeschmack der Diktatur von Marx und Engels.c 
Next he went to America and tried to stir up trouble against us, but very soon 
disappeared from the scene. His reports from Vienna before the advent of 
Windischgrätz showed an undue bias towards violent revolution which, at a 
time when reaction was everywhere gathering strength, was not unwelcome 
to us. In those days we could not, from a distance, assess the value of his 
pronouncements on personalities, but he  was doubtless strongly influenced 
by personal inclination. In such turbulent times we had to allow our 
correspondents a great deal of res ponsibility and a corresponding amount of 
latitude. 
And now for another piece of political ne ws which might be of use to you 
should such matters crop up again: On the evening before last we heard 
political rumours of a ministerial cris is here, according to which Harcourt, 
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was proposing to resign. At the same time, 
however, he denied this, saying that the allegation, AS MADE , was completely 
unfounded. It was improbable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer alone 
should resign at a moment when he ha d a surplus of three million pounds and 
was thus in a position to present a first class

budget. But the real facts of the case are as follows: Harcourt favours the 
introduction of salaries for M.P.s before the dissolution and is encountering 
strong opposition in the Cabinet—a nd probably also from the Queen.a He 
had apparently threatened to resign, t hus obtaining concessions in regard to 
the afore-said question. At all events everything has returned to normal for 
the time being. You can see how unstable things are in official circles over 
here. 
All the necessary steps have been taken as regards the money. You will, I 
think, be hearing more about this in a few days’ time when, I trust, you will 
also get the cash.b 
Louise wishes to append a line or two. She and Ludwig send their regards,

My dear Sir, 
I have duly received yours of the 1st December. What Mr. von Struve 
means by saying that Marx, completes but not disproves Malthus’ theory of 
population I do not understand.a I think the note on Malthus in Vol. I, Note 
75, to Chapter XXII I, Ib ought to have been explicit enough for anybody. 
Moreover, I do not see, how anybody can speak of completing Malthus’ 
theory today, when that theory rests upon the assumption, that population 
presses on the means of subsistence, while corn in London is at 20/- the 
quarter, or less than half the average price from 1848 to 1870, and when it is 
universally acknowledged that the means of subsistence now press upon the 
population which is not large enough to consume them! As to Russia, if the 
peasant is compelled to sell the corn which he ought to eat, surely it is not 
pressure of [excess] population which compels him to do so, but pressure 
from the tax-gatherer, the landlord, the kulak* etc. etc. As far as I know, the 
low price of Argentinian wheat has more to do with agrarian distress all ever 
Europe, Russia included, than anything else. 
We have just learned that a savant of your city has been informed that he 
can have Vol. II P passed free to him on applying specially for it at the office 
of the Censorship. I think it as well to  communicate this fact to you because 
it may lead you to give me instructions how to forward to you the remaining 
sheets which I hold at your disposal,

collection of Tribunea articles is still in existence. At the same time I shall get 
other friends in America to search for such ancient tomes as may still be in

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 
IN VIENNA 
London, 12 January 1895 
 
Dear Victor, 
My last letter was sent to you at Schwarzspaniera on the 9th of this month. 
Today, simply as a precaution, I am  again notifying you that yesterday 
Louise addressed a registered letter to you at Ferstelgasse 6,b containing a 
CHEQUE for 3,500 gulden drawn on the tenth of this month by the Anglo-
Foreign Banking Company Ltd. on the Union Bank of Vienna to the order of 
Dr Victor Adler, payable dans les huit jours.c 
If you have received this safely, w ould you please drop a line to Louise 
informing her of the fact so that she may pass on the information to the 
chaps over here and thus set their minds at rest. Then the formal document 
with its various signatures can follow.d 
But if you have not received the CHEQUE , then hasten at once to the Union 
Bank and STOP PAYMENT . Unfortunately the international postal services do 
not admit of a declaration of value or insurance, hence a certain amount of 
anxiety prevails over here. 
As regards Marx, I have searched through the Neue Rheinische Zeitung 
and all I have found is this: The issue of 25 Aug. 1848 states that ‘yesterday 
K. M. left for Vienna where he will be spending a few days’. (Not from 
Cologne, mind you; he had already gone away and it was, I think, from 
Hamburg that he arranged for the insertion of this notice.) And then there is a 
later piece of news, 31 August from Vienna , to the effect that Marx gave a 
lecture yesterday at the Vienna Workers’  Association in Josefstadt on social 
conditions in Western Europe {Stifft spoke after him, at the same 
Association) {Neue Rheinische Zeitung, 6 Sept.) and, according to the issue 
of 8 Sept., Marx spoke on 2 Sept. ‘at a meeting of the first Vienna Workers’ 
Association on the subject of socio- economic conditions’.—That is all. 
Meanwhile in Berlin, on 7 September, a crucial vote

had been taken on Stein’s motion, 474 Hansemann’s Ministry had fallen and, 
conflict being inevitable, Marx returned hot-foot. On 12 Sept. he wrote

Dear Hermann, 
At long last! But I haven’t got the time to make excuses. First of all, my 
thanks for your news which has put me pretty well au fait again. I shall now 
repay the debt by telling you all manner of things in return. To begin with, 
you will see above a change of address. This came about as follows: 
About a year ago Mrs Kautsky, my fellow-lodger, became engaged to a 
compatriot of hers, Dr Freyberger, a young and extremely able Viennese 
physician who settled in this country two years ago. Before long a desire 
manifested itself to clinch the engage ment with a marriage but, since I had 
no desire to put myself at the mercy of strangers in my old age, it was 
arranged that we should all three set up house together, and thus the need 
arose for a larger place. In the m eantime the young couple had got married 
early in February while we were s till living at 122, but we soon found and 
took a very nice, large and exceptionally cheap house in a far better part of 
the same road. We moved in at the beginning of October and, at

paces from Primrose Hill and rather le ss from the entrance to Regent’s Park.

study, with three windows facing the street and very easy to keep warm—at 
the back my bedroom, also large; 2nd floor: four rooms occupied by the 
Freyberger family; 3rd floor, likewise four rooms for maid servants, visitors, 
box rooms, etc. A small front garden and a larger and, for these parts, really 
quite pleasant one at the back. All this at a cost of £85 a year, as compared 
with the £60 I used to pay! The secret lies in the fact that the LANDLORD lives 
in Lancashire and doesn’t want to spe nd money, but merely to take it. So I 
advanced round about £200 for repairs, in return for which I shall pay no rent 
for two and a half years and live on the advance. The last tenant, a doctor, 
used to pay £130, from which you will see how much the value of houses 
fluctuates here. 
This rehousing business happened during the summer and, since I took the 
place on a seven year lease with the opti on to renew for another seven years, 
this and obtaining a guarantee for my advance have necessitated prolonged 
legal negotiations which have prevented me from going any distance away 
from London. Hence I only spent five weeks or so at Eastbourne on the south 
coast. 393 It is one of the nicest seaside places I know and is, in fact, already 
becoming a seaside suburb of London for people who don’t have to come up 
to town more than a couple of times a week. 
Please will you again convey my bela ted congratulations to Elsbetha on 
her engagement, and to Walterb on having, or so I hope, successfully passed 
his examinations, Actually, I still owe Walter a letter but must, alas, continue 
in his debt, thus also owing him, no less than yourself, an apology. I trust he 
won’t take it amiss.

sherry is beyond our powers, What I had been waiting for was a visit from 
Brett, my supplier, but he came much later than usual. I have now asked him 
to let me have three sample bottles of sherry, as similar as possible to the 
first that was sent to you, and of three qualities. The little case has just 
arrived. On Monday I shall take it to the CONTINENTAL PARCELS EXPRESS 
and it will probably come to you by ca rrier; the weight exceeds the 7 lb. limit 
laid down by international postal regulations, Now, when you try them out, I 
would advise you to decant half a bottle of the variety you prefer and keep it 
there. The bottles are numbered 1, 2, 3 and, when you order, only the number 
need be given. The price of all three is 42/- a dozen, or 3/6d a bottle, carriage 
paid from London. Unless otherwise instructed, I shall arrange for them to be 
brought by steamer direct to Cologne or Düsseldorf. 
One more thing. Since fewer payments now have to be debited to my 
account over there, the balance you hold for me is continually mounting. The 
removal has involved other expenses , aside from the advance to my 
LANDLORD , and I should be glad if, in the c ourse of this month, you could let 
me have, say, £40. 
Finally, I have a pleasant piece of news to impart, namely that I have at 
last become an old man. Last spring I had an attack of bronchitis which, 
though not at all severe, refused to budge  for six weeks or more; and on top 
of that I suffered a great deal last y ear from stomach-ache, constipation, etc. 
So in the end I had perforce to believe Freyberger when he said I must no 
longer indulge in my former Sparjitzen.a And when the looking glass reflects 
an ever more abject image of encro aching baldness, I can  no longer conceal 
from myself the realisation that there is very little in common between 74 
and 4 7. Eating and drinking have both been considerably curtailed and I also 
have to submit to all kinds of unwonted protective measures against catching 
cold. Well, I shall have to put up with it, and at least it hasn’t cost me my 
sense of humour. 
So that’s that, and my debt, I trust, is now repaid. My best love to Emmab

My dear Lafargue, 
I am glad to see that you have already arranged matters with Adler and 
have at last found a translator who does you justice. 477 
Things are going well. If the year ‘95 finishes as it has begun we may see 
some strange happenings. In Germany, young Williama has fallen into the 
hands of the ‘agrarians’ (the big aristocratic landowners of the Eastern 
provinces, the Junkern)b who want to make sure of their control over this 
young ninny and who can only do so by  compromising William to the point 
of no return. Thus they are hinting at a dissolution of the Reichstag, which 
will emerge from fresh elections more refractory than ever and then, his 
throne and his honour being at stake, th ere will be nothing for it but a coup d’ 
état to give William the means of obtaining new soldiers and ships, and the 
Junkers new import duties on agricultural produce and subsidies on the 
export of sugar, spirits, etc. That seems to be these gentlemen’s idea; 
impossible to say how far it will materialise. In the meantime, they are 
playing with fire—the War Ministerc openly inviting our people in the 
Reichstag to come out on to the st reets by jeering at them—they are 
absolutely determined to create an opportunity for firing on the people. 478 
And in your country there are the scandals of bourgeois corruption which 
go beyond anything and are driving towards a crisis: certainly if the Ministry 
threatens to bring the majority to court unless it votes against Gérault-
Richard, matters cannot go on much longer. 479 The

victory of the bourgeois, who have succeeded in electing a model bourgeoisa 
President of the Republic, may well bring about the collapse of the whole 
bourgeois régime; the climax is appro aching when they will be overthrown. 
As I see it, it is the bourgeoisie itself which, in your country, takes 
responsibility for doing socialist propaganda amongst the peasants. It is a 
long and wearisome task to enlighten peasants on political matters, but they 
will not be so stupid as not to realise at this juncture that they are being 
robbed. But once they have spotted that, there is nothing for them but to turn 
to the Socialists, the only party which is not involved in the thefts; for the 
Radicals 86 are well and truly done for. 
So you see we can jolly well shout: Prosit Neujahrb! 
Speaking of the new year: your credit account of sixty pounds has been 
opened, if you want a cheque for tw enty pounds, you have only to let me 
know. 
I have sent Laura some working-cl ass papers from here, Blatchford’s 
(alias Nunquam) Clarion and Keir Hardie’s Labour Leader. Since the end of 
the Workman’s Times, this is the only literature of the Independent Labour 
Party. 114 Sad but true. 
A fortnight ago I received a letter fro m Vaillant enclosing some of his 
Bills. 480 I promised I would examine them critically as soon as I had the 
time.c Meanwhile I told him 25 that Wroblewski, in Nice, has written asking 
me for money, that he has had an accident, broken his arm, has been in 
hospital and is in great distress; that I have given him as much help as I could 
but that it is beyond my means and that in my view the Communards and the 
socialist deputies owe it to their honour not to let him die of starvation. He 
replied that they had tried to get up a public subscription for Wroblewski but 
that he, W., was against this and that there is nothing to be done. 
Do you know anything about this? Wroblewski as a true Pole does not 
understand the handling of money, he spends it lavishly when he has it; 
perhaps he has done similar things in  relation to Vaillant and others who 
would have been able to help him. What he needs is a little regular pension, 
paid out once a month in small amounts. But in my view it is a matter of the 
honour of French socialism which cannot claim credit for the Commune of 
1871 if they allow the last general of the Commune to die of hunger. What

favour were he to ensure that the thing was disseminated as widely as 
possible.a The man is a blockhead. 
I cannot understand how it was that y ou should have failed to receive 
Volume II Ib until five days after Schlüter had got his. I posted both at the 
same time on 12 Dec. and the receipts for both are still joined together. I 
enclose them herewith in case you should wish to lodge a complaint, 
I have for some time been aware of the temporary decline of the move-
ment in America and it is not the German socialists who will stem it. Though 
America is the youngest it is also the oldest country in the world. In the same 
way as you have, over there, the most antiquated furniture designs alongside 
your own vernacular ones or, in Boston, cabs such as I last saw in London in 
1838 and, in the mountains, seventeenth century STAGE COACHES , alongside 
PULLMAN CARS , so too you continue to sport all the old mental trappings 
which Europe has already discarded. Everything that is outmoded here may 
persist in America for another generation or two. Karl Heinzen, for instance, 
not to mention religious and spiritualist superstition. Thus you still have old 
Lassalleans amongst you, while a man like Sanial, who would now seem 
passé in France, is still able to play a role over there. This may be attributed 
on the one hand to the fact that, over and above its concern for material 
production and the accumulation of wea lth, America is only now beginning 
to find time for untramelled intellectual work and the preliminary training 
this demands; on the other hand, it may also be attributed to the dual nature 
of America’s development, still engaged as it is on the one hand in the 
primary task of reclaiming the vast area of untamed country, while being 
already compelled on the other to co mpete for first place in industrial 
production. Hence the UPS AND DOWNS of the movement, according to which 
point of view takes precedence in th e average person’s mind—that of the 
urban working man or that of the peasant engaged in reclamation. In a couple 
of years’ time all this will change and then we shall witness a great step 
forward. The evolution of the Anglo-Saxon RACE with its ancient Teutonic 
freedom happens to be quite exceptionally slow, pursuing as it does a zig-zag 
course (small zig-zags here in England, colossal ones on your side of the 
Atlantic) and tacking against the wind, but making headway none the less.

Here in Europe the New Year will bring with it a very complex state of 
affairs. In Germany the peasant question has been pushed into the 
background by the Subversion Bill 428 and the latter—by young William (his 
Song to Aegir, 483 the lord of the waves, owes its inspiration solely to the 
seasickness from which he invariably suffers, which is why he and his Fleet 
always make for the calm waters of the Norwegian fjords). The young man 
has thrown Germany into complete disorder, no one knows where he stands 
or what the morrow will bring, the conf usion in governmental circles, as in 
the ruling classes generally, grows worse from day to day and, during the 
debate on the Subversion Bill, the onl y people with cheerful expressions 
were our chaps. But it really is too marvellous! At the head of the anti-
subversionists stands a man who is unabl e to desist from subversion for five 
minutes on end. And the aforementi oned young William has now fallen into 
the clutches of the Junkers who, in order to keep him in a frame of mind in 
which he is prepared to give them extra help with their bankrupt estates, are 
presently dangling before him the carro t of more taxation and more troops 
and warships by their os tentatious advocacy of regis voluntas suprema lex,a 
and are egging him on to dissolve the Reichstag and stage a coup d’état. At 
the same time, however, these gentlemen, Köller & Co., despite their 
ostentatious catchwords, are so poorly endowed with courage that they are 
already prey to all manner of forebodi ngs, and it may well be asked whether 
they will not take fright when the moment for action comes. 
And as for France! There, as in Italy, the bourgeoisie precipitated itself 
head first into corruption in a manner that would put America to shame. For 
the past three years all efforts in both countries have been directed towards 
finding a bourgeois government—admitte dly not free from corruption—but 
whose immediate involvement in public scandal is nevertheless so slight that 
a parliament could support it without unduly violating the commonest 
decencies. In Italy Crispi will hang on for a little while longer only because 
the Kingb and the Crown Princec are as deeply implicated in the banking 
scandals as he is himself.d In France, our forty-five or fifty socialist deputies 
have just toppled their third Ministry on the count of actual corruption, and 
Casimir-Périer has gone tumbling after. 484 Presumably his intention is to 
pose as the one and only saviour of 
a the King’s will is supreme law. - b Umberto I —c Victor Emmanuel — d See this volume, p. 390

My dear Löhr, 
Your last letter has indeed startled me. 485 I have tried, not very success-
fully, to recollect the terms used in  my letter to you of December 29tha; still, 
in what I do remember there is not a word which ought to offend you. And 
indeed, if there is anything in the tone of that letter which you think strange, 
it is there entirely against my will and intention. 
It never could occur, nor has it ever occurred to me for a moment to

doubt the right or the propriety, on your part, of inquiring at any time what 
steps I had taken or intended to take in order to secure the return, at the time 
of my death, to you, the rightful owners, of those papers of Mohr’s which you 
have entrusted to me. Nor have I ever found anything to object to in the terms 
in which you spoke of that subject to Tussy. It seems, therefore, so 
exceedingly strange to me that I should have written to you in a tone that 
ought to give you reason to complain. 
I did indeed feel nettled at the way Tussy caused the question to be 
submitted to me, and, under the circ umstances, thought I was bound to speak 
to her about it. When I did, I told her, not once, but three or four times over, 
that I had not one word to say against your letter, neither as to the subject 
matter, nor as to the terms used. Anyhow, Tussy and I had an explanation, 
which as far as I know, settled everythi ng connected with that subject, and 
left us as good friends as before; and I should regret very much if, through 
any unguarded words of mine, or through some other circumstance, that little 
incident had thrown its shadow as far as Le Perreux. 
In the meantime things have come to a crisis in your neighbourhood. I 
intended to write at some length about that, but Bebel all at once asked me 
for historical materials as to the various and pretty frequent riots here in 
England which are settled without ever attempting to encumber the Statute 
Book with increased penal laws or exceptional legislation. He is in the 
Committee on the Umsturzvorlage 428 and wants it for them, so I had to leave 
everything else alone and get it off by this day’s post before the usual 
Sunday delays in postal communication retard it. 
Anyhow our 50 French Socialist memb ers are in luck. In less than 18 
months they have upset three ministries and one president. 484 That shows 
what a Socialist minority can do in a parliament which, like the French or 
English, is the really supreme power in the country. A similar power our men 
in Germany can get by a revolution only; still, the break-up of the Centre 
party 71 would make them the arbiters of the house and give them the balance 
of power. 
What a miserable retreat is that of Casimir’sa! After the brag with which 
he came in, to skedaddle at the first serious difficulty! 486 It looks as if our 
bourgeois heroes had individually degene rated quite as much as their class 
has done collectively.

In Germany it looks as if the same principle was prevailing; Bebel does 
not seem to think von Köller and Co. the men likely to carry through a coup 
d’état to the end; it seems everywhere the story of Béranger’s old fool who 
courted Babette and found out too late th at his courting days were past and 
gone.a 
The greatest success, however, seems to me  to be this, that the scandalous 
affairs of the opportunist majority have been again exposed, that Raynal has 
been nailed down, and that it seems impossible to have the subject burked 
again. 487 The evidence of the corruption of all other parties must work 
wonders in favour of ours, especially in France, and ought to secure us 
immense and unhoped for successes at the next general election which 
cannot be very distant now, for who can govern with the present Chamber? 
Ça chauffe!b and neither Félix Faure nor young Williamc will be able to 
put out the fire. 
I shall write to Paul as soon as ever I get a moment’s time. Thanks for the 
papers which I have sent on to Tussy after using them.

the Republic is involved in the general collapse.a Three Cabinets and one 
President finished off 484—that’s not doing too badly. The socialist group 
seems to have succeeded to th e role of the late Clemenceau 488—and will play 
it better, I hope. It is now established that no ministry can exist without at 
least the help of the extreme Left. That will lead to the dissolution, to which 
the growing stench of the opportunists’ corruption is also leading. 87 In which 
case you will be returned in greater strength, both numerically and morally; 
that can lead to the formation of Lassalle’s ‘great reactionary mass’, 214 the 
coalition of all the bourgeois parties against socialism, a mass which is 
always formed at a time of danger, afte rwards to be dissolved again into its 
various and mutually opposed groups of interests; large landowners, large 
manufacturers, high finance, small and middling bourgeoisie, peasants, etc. 
But, each time it is reformed, it gains so lidity until the day of  crisis, when we 
shall have a compact mass confronting us. We have had this process of 
continual concentration and dissolution in Germany ever since our Party 
numbered more than 20 members in the Reichstag; but in your case, it will 
go faster because decisive power is in the hands of your Chamber of 
Deputies. 
Mr Faure may do what he likes, he cannot halt this process of forming into 
two opposing camps, nor the confusion wh ich is necessarily born of this 
interplay of opposing forces, attraction and repulsion, within the milieu of 
the bourgeois parties. That is precise ly the milieu we need, and which the 
existence of a socialist group creates  everywhere, however little power it 
may have in Parliament. You will race ahead; it is the Party’s progress itself 
that will first subdue and then eliminat e the intestine and traditional quarrels. 
The addition of 30 Radicals has brought you luck, without them the group 
would not have had cohe sion. Without Millerand y ou would not have been 
able to take advantage of the politi cal situations as you have done. And 
Jaurès, indeed, seems full of goodwill—if he develops rather slowly it is 
perhaps a good thing for him and for us. Though frankly, in economic 
matters he needs further schooling. His Bills for immediate reforms in the 
Petite République 489 article are not quite as wild as his Bill for a corn 
monopoly, 13 but they are calling on the bourgeois for sacrifices incompatible 
with the advance of capitalist industry, so that in their eyes they are 
tantamount to immediate expropriation; whereas, on the other

hand, he proposes improvement of the soil at the nation’s expense, of the soil 
which would remain private property,  and under conditions perpetuating the 
small peasant and which would create a new Panama 60 for the big 
landowners who would laugh at the ‘ob ligation’ etc. with which the Bill 
saddled them. This is to see as a co mplete abstraction the environment in 
which one lives and in which these reforms would be carried out. So long as 
the air is not cleansed by the removal of all the parliamentary and financial 
rogues, this improvement of individual landed property at everyone’s 
expense would end as a colossal theft; and when we have got rid of these 
gentlemen, we shall be strong enough to do better than that. 
The presidential crisis furthermore will have a capital effect on European 
politics. The Franco-Russian alliance is becoming more and more lenitive, 
insofar as the Russian hope of seeing the restoration of the monarchy emerge 
from the presidential crisis suffers repeated disillusionment. At the same time 
the Triple Alliance 126 has ceased to exist except on paper; bankrupt Italy 
slips through its fingers, Austria is only retained: by fear of war with Russia, 
for which she would foot the bill; this danger vanishes as Russia loses the 
chance of using the French army when she sees fit; young Williama has made 
himself far more disagreeable to his friends than to hi s enemies. So that, with 
the complete revolution in weapons since 1870 and, in consequence, of 
tactics, there is a total uncertainty about the outcome of a war where so many 
imponderables are involved and regarding which all the calculations made in 
advance are based on fictitious quantities. In these circumstances we seem to 
be assured of peace and even the most  frenzied bourgeois ch auvinists of the 
Déroulède type can keep calm: the Pr ussians have taken over responsibility 
in Alsace for maintaining and nourishing French patriotism. 
Herewith cheque for twenty pounds; if  that can do you until the beginning 
of April, I should be glad; at that time I shall have certain payments coming 
in which will allow me to be more liberal. But, if needs be, I could perhaps, 
after all, send you ten pounds in March—we’ll see.

Dear Sir, 
I still have to thank you for your ki ndness in sending me your critique of 
Barth ‘s book and your interesting article on Pestalozzi. 490 I would beg you 
to excuse the delay which was occasi oned by an excess of work, the latter 
being aggravated by my having moved house (please note the change of 
address). 
I should say that you have let Mr Barth off rather lightly; he would, at any 
rate, have fared far worse at my hands. However, in literary debate one has to 
get used to the fact that, lawyer-fashion, one’s opponent suppresses what 
doesn’t suit his book and introduces extran eous matter if he thinks this will 
enable him to pull the wool over his r eader’s eyes. But in Mr Barth’s case 
this is done in a manner and to an extent that cannot but lead one to ask 
whether what we have here is simple ignorance and boneheadedness or 
deliberate, wilful distortion. To take only his chapter on Marx—how does 
one explain the horrendous misinterpretations, nearly all of which are 
incomprehensible in a man who does, after all, claim to have read my Anti-
Dühring and Feuerbacha which should have constitute d a perfectly adequate 
antidote? And what can one say about the absurd causal nexus attributed to 
me on p. 135. 
‘In France Calvinism had been conquered, which is why in the eighteenth 
century, Christianity had become in capable of serving as an ideo- 
a F. Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of  Classical German Philosophy.

logical cloak for any sort of progressi ve class’? When I compare it with the 
original, Feuerbach, p. 65,a find it virtually impossible to believe that this is 
not deliberate distortion. 
I am interested by what you have to say about August Comte. So far as 
this ‘philosopher’ is concerned, there still remains, in my opinion, a fair 
amount of work to be done. For five years Comte was secretary and con-
fidant of Saint-Simon. The latter positively suffered from an over-fertile 
intellect; he was at once a genius and a mystic. Lucid analysis, classification, 
systematisation, none of this was his cup of tea. Thus in Comte he got hold of 
a man intended, perhaps, to present this proliferation of ideas to the world in 
orderly fashion after the Master’s deat h; Comte’s mathematical training and 
mode of thought may have made him seem peculiarly suited to the purpose 
as compared with the other, visionary disciples. But then Comte suddenly 
broke with the ‘Master’ and withdrew from the school. After quite a while he 
re-emerged with his ‘positive philosophy’.b In this system there are three 
characteristic elements; 1. A series of brilliant ideas nearly all of which, 
however, suffer to a greater or lesser extent from inadequate development; 2. 
A correspondingly narrow, philistine outl ook in stark contrast to that 
brilliance; 3. A religious system of undoubtedly Saint-Simonian origin but 
stripped of all mysticism, hierarchically organised and utterly flat—with, at 
its head, a pope, no less. Thus Huxley was able to say of Comtism 491 that it 
was Catholicism without Christianity.c 
Now I am willing to bet that No. 3 supplies the key to the otherwise 
incomprehensible inconsistency of Nos 1 and 2; namely, that Comte derived 
all his brilliant ideas from Saint-Simon but he assembled them in a manner 
peculiar to himself and by so doing bowdlerised them. By stripping them of 
the mysticism with which they were imbued, he simultaneously degraded 
them to a lower level, giving them a philistine slant in accordance with his 
own lights. A great many of them can be easily traced back  to their Saint-
Simonian source and I feel sure that certain others would admit of the same 
treatment if only someone could be found who would seriously apply himself 
to the task. This fact would assuredly have been discovered long since had 
not Saint-Simon’s own writings been 
a F. Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy.a See present 
edition, Vol. 26, p. 396 - b A. Comte, Cours de philosophie Positive — c See Th. Henry Huxley,

completely overwhelmed after 1830 by the clamour of the école et religion 
saint-simmoniennesa which emphasised individual aspects of the Master’s 
teaching and elaborated it at th e cost of the grand design. 
There is one further point I should like to put right, namely the note on p. 
513. 492 Marx was never Secretary General to the International but merely 
Secretary for Germany and Russia. And none of the Comtists in London 
participated in the founding of the International. At the time of the 
Commune, Professor E. Beesly did yeoman service in defending the 
International in the press against the violent attacks then being made upon it, 
and Frederic Harrison also publicly defended the Commune. 493 But a few 
years later the Comtists’ attitude towards the labour movement grew 
perceptibly cooler; Labour was becoming too powerful and, if a proper 
balance was to be maintained between capitalists and workers (both being, of 
course, producteur0 in the sense understood by Saint-Simon 494), the former 
should again, it was felt, be given support, since which time the Comtists 
have kept quite mum on the subject of the labour question. 
Yours sincerely,

There is no need at all for you to worry about the editorial side. During the 
early weeks you, as organiser, are infinitely more important than you would 
be as actual editor. Once everything is going smoothly, you should have no 
difficulty in striking the right note in the paper. You are quite right about it’s 
being a mite too serious. A bit more humour, particularly on the front page, 
which used always to be very funny in  the twiceweekly edition, would do no 
harm at all. However, that will come. 
A direct telegraph service from foreign capitals would be of absolutely no 
use to you, That would mean your having a properly organised office in every 
city with a chief correspondent to run it professionally, and solely on your 
account; here in London this would cost between six hundred and a thousand 
pounds a year, and even so you woul dn’t be getting the best news from 
ministerial or opposition circles, for the simple reason that you are only 
accorded priority and given news of this sort ahead of everyone else and 
before it has become common property if you are able to reciprocate by 
giving your informants your support and publishing the ready-made puffs 
they send you. But that is just what our press cannot do. So, where news from 
official circles is concerned, you will never be able to compete with the big 
bourgeois papers who not only monopolise the sources but can also organise 
news-gathering services on a footing similar to that of big industry. 
It’s hard luck, your having to content yourselves during the first few 
weeks with the little provincial assemblie s, but the Diet will soon be meeting 
again and then you will have plenty of material, whereupon your personal 
intervention will agai n become necessary, 
The differences in the Ministry here are of no great account so far as their 
practical consequences are concerned.  The Liberal government contains as 
many shades of opinion as it has members. Now that the big bourgeoisie 
together with Whig aristocrats 497 and the university ideologues have gone 
over to the Conservative camp (a process which began after 1848, gained 
impetus after the Reform Bill of 1867 498 and became very marked after the 
HOME RULE BILL 171). Liberalism has been largely an omnium gatherum of all 
the sects and sectarian crotchets in this sect-ridden count ry. And since each 
individual sect considers its own particular crotchet to be the one and only 
panacea, the result is constant strife. 
But of greater moment than that strife is the certain knowledge that only 
cohesion vis-à-vis the outside world can keep them in power for a

few months longer. Consequently it is a matter of pure chance which 
tendency may gain the upper hand. 
I have been sending you in rotation c opies of the three labour newspapers 
which still survive here. Since you get the Clarion by way of exchange I 
shall spare you this in future. There is nothing much in any of the three but 
nevertheless it’s advisable that you should take a look at one or the other 
from time to time. The Labour Leader is an institution for the idolisation of 
Keir Hardie; he is a cunning, crafty Scot, a Pecksniff and arch-intriguer, but 
too cunning, perhaps, and too vain. Th e financial sources he draws upon to 
keep the paper going are of a dubious kind, which might cause 
unpleasantness when the new elections are held. 
Apropos. Not a single copy of Thursday evening’s issuea (confiscated) 
arrived here. But nevertheless I should like to read the article, K. M. in Wien 
471 Could you get hold of a nother copy for me? That  was an astounding piece 
of cheek, by the way your announcing the confiscation to have been so 
extraordinarily effective th at it enabled you to save yourselves the expense of 
another, quite unnecessary, edition. 499 You people are lucky in Austria—if 
you were to say something like that in Prussia they would promptly chuck 
three Subversion Bills 428 at your head. 
We shall be sending you extracts from la Crawford’s Paris letters when-
ever they contain something of interest. I would specially call your attention 
to them. She has been in Paris for over forty years, knows every mouse in the 
place by name, possesses dossiers on the career of every politician and is a 
good judge of character. No one in Paris can equal her knowledge of 
personalities and you would therefore be well-advised to file away for future 
reference even those articles for which you have no present use. Over and 
over again she has seen all her Radical and Republican friends plunge into 
the mire of corruption and has thus, bourgeois though she is, acquired a 
remarkable sympathy for Socialists. She has one unshakeable conviction, 
however, and that is that J. Guesde is Marx’s son-in-law. 
Yesterday I sent you another excerpt from one of her articles. 500 
Louise has been especially gratified by the unequivocal rejection of the 
petitions of the Women’s Union—see Cl ara Zetkin’s article in the supple-
ment to Thursday’s Vorwärts. 501 Clara is right and did after all manage to 
get the article accepted in the teeth of  long and determined opposition. Bravo

Esteemed Comrade, 
Unfortunately for somewhat over a year I have been forced to make it my 
duty politely but firmly to decline all invitations to contribute to festive 
messages, etc., in particular periodically recurring ones, or to send messages 
of greetings on holidays (18 March, May Day, etc.), the only deviation from 
this rule being certain exceptional o ccasions, which promise an immediate 
specific effect. When you were bringing out the first issue of the daily in 
Vienna, I believed congratul ations to be indicated.a If I sent you two lines for 
the May Day address, I would be comp elled to do the same for the Czechs, 
Hungarians, Italians, Germans, Romanians and who knows what other 
nations and, moreover, probably send in  addresses for the various May Day 
meetings, leave alone anniversaries like the 13thb and 18th of March.

Dear Comrade, 
Unfortunately I can give you absolutely no hint as to how the German 
comrades might view the proposal regard ing the addition to the name of the 
next congress. 506 So far as I myself am concerned, I think that on this 
occasion one might oblige the Trades Unions , since the congress will be held 
on English soil where the Trades Unions have, after all, always got the bulk 
of organised labour behind them, so that a congress in which they played no 
part would create a bad impression. At the same time it cannot but be of 
importance to us to encourage the trend that is driving Trades Unions more 
and more into the socialist camp. Kindest regards.

head. Having made your plans for Marx’s articles, you really might have told 
me about them a bit sooner rather then at the very last moment. 507 In a case 
such as this, where I am the administrator of other people’s property, I 
cannot rush things in the same way as I could if the matter simply concerned 
myself. Added to that, I am at this moment getting Lassalle’s letters 284 ready 
for you and these are far more likely to fall foul of the Subversion Bill 428 
than Marx’s articles—the latter, then, is the work I ought to put on one side! 
So tell me first of all what format and type you are using and how large 
the edition is to be, also the selling pr ice, for on this occasion I shall, for 
various reasons, only sell you the right to one edition of a specific size. 
Meanwhile I shall have a word with Tussy; as soon as I get your reply, I 
shall let you know for certain. 
If you cannot advise me of the exact selling price, it will be sufficient if 
you say how much you propose to charge per printed sheet. 
I assume that you have a copy of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung —Revue 
from which to reprint. For I myself do not possess one of my own and if I did 
I couldn’t let it out of my hands. 
Now for another matter. When the Vorwärts set up its bookselling side, 
Augusta wrote to say that I would be sent two copies of all your publications. 
Of late, however, that has been very far from the case. For instance, I have 
not received your latest edition of the Manifesto, or indeed either of the 
Berlin editions. 508 I am still short of sundry lesser pieces and am listing those 
that immediately spring to mind. You would greatly oblige me by sending 
them to me, namely your reprint of the Subversion Debate in two parts’b and 
a couple of copies of the most recent edition of the Communist Manifesto. —
As regards the other things I am short of, I have just seen from your list that 
you are not to blame, since you were not the publisher. Apart from the above 
I am still short of

have to speak to her about it first, a nd obtain her consent, and then the best 
would be for her to talk to me, and I will take care of the rest. Or else she can 
talk to Louise Freyberger if she pref ers, and Louise will see to everything. 
That is my suggestion, but if you think you have another idea on how to 
achieve your aim, tell me about it, and we can discuss it.

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS 
IN BARMEN 
London, 8 February 1895 
 
Dear Hermann, 
The arrival of your letter of the 23rd coincided with a spell of fine, frosty 
weather which has been playing Old Harry with consignments of wine. I 
have nevertheless ordered your sherry from Dublin but with the proviso that I 
shall not give instructions for it to be despatched until such time as the Rhine 
is open again and there is no longer any danger of the wine freezing en route. 
Indeed, I myself had a mild fright wh en five cases!—fifteen dozen of port 
and claret en route to me from Dublin were exposed for about forty-eight 
hours to an unexpected frost. It would seem, however, that everything has 
turned out all right, for the stuff I have  sampled so far has not suffered, while 
a period of repose in my splendid wine cellar—an even temperature and 
space for nearly one hundred dozen in eight brick-walled bins—will see to 
the rest. 
For the first time in many years we are again having a real Continental 
winter over here. Warm, almost spring-like up till the New Year with the 
shrubs all coming into bud, then cold and, for the past three weeks, constant 
sharp frost (80-100 Centigrade—60-80 Réamur of frost at night) and snow. 
When the north-easter blows it is bitterly cold but when, like yesterday and 
today, there is little wind, it is glori ous. Fortunately there is always enough 
wind to disperse the fog, the result being a marvellous blue sky. 
I can well imagine your tribulations as a result of wining, dining and 
dancing to the accompaniment of serena des from a cavalry band. Over here 
we call it THE SOCIAL TREADMILL which, however diverting it may often 
have been in one’s younger days, is a pretty ghastly business when one gets 
older. I fight tooth and nail to keep out of  it, but in this country, too, the likes 
of us cannot escape it entirely at Christmastime. 
The £40 from Wilhelm Pf. duly and gratefully received. 
Incidentally, on this occasion I surviv ed the treadmill of the festive season 
in better shape than usual because  I took proper care of myself and

just now, what with icy weather so similar to that at home, I feel better than I 
have done for a long time. I have also been able to put the heating properties 
of my new study to the supreme test, for not only is ther e the extraordinary 
cold to contend with, but, added to that, the two neighbouring houses are 
both empty, i.e. unheated, and my room abuts on the two party walls. And I 
have nevertheless managed to keep it warm. It was not until yesterday that I 
felt a bit chilly, but whenever one’s need is greatest, help is always close at 
hand. On this occasion Rudolf’sa nightshirt stepped into the breech, 
whereupon I smartly stepped into it. 
You can learn about my fellow occupantsb from Oscar Jaeger who met 
them both at my house when he last visited us here. Freyberger was courting 
at that particular time and spent the evening with us. 
I have just received a deputation from the local  rating authority. The 
gentlemen wished to satisfy themselves that I was not in fact paying more 
than, £85 for the house, the reason being that the last tenant had paid £130, 
while the rates for the house are based on an annual rental of £110. Needless 
to say I protested. I showed the gentlemen all the documents and shall now 
see what they do. Out of the eight houses close by, four are empty and so I 
hope they will deal mercifully with me. 
Well then, I have ordered 11/2 dozen No. 1 and 11/2 dozen No. 2 sherry 
as per samples. 
As you have said nothing further about it, I assume that Walterc has 
passed his exam and I send him my congratulations. Even heartier con-
gratulations to Elsbethd on her forthcoming marriage. But she must also tell 
me the day, so that we over here can also indulge ourselves in her and her 
bridegroom’se honour. 
Much love, then, to Emmaf and all your children, your sons and 
daughters-in-law and your children’s children.

Dear Fischer, 
If you yourself are of the opinion that the difference in price as between 60 
Pfennigs and 1 Mark will make little difference so far as sales are concerned, 
I am, of course, in favour of selling the edition for 1 Mark. In return for a fee 
of 400 Marks I therefore assign you the ri ght to bring out an edition of up to 
3,000 copies and you may start printing straight away. 507 I shall get down to 
the Introduction forthwith and let you have it very shortly. The copy I have 
of the Neue Rheinische Zeitungs-Revue came into my possession on the strict 
understanding that it would not leave this house, besides which it is most 
necessary to me for the correction of proofs, since the relevant text was 
corrected in Hamburg and contains a mass of misprints—it was copied from 
Marx’s manuscript. It is equally necessary to me for purposes of comparison 
in respect of the Introduction. So please send me the first proofs in galley 
form and I can then insert th e necessary explanatory notes. 511 
N. B., thirty-six free copies should be reserved for myself; a considerable 
number of them have to be passed on to the heirs. 
So for the time being I shall leave Lassalle’s letters 284 on one side. The 
explanatory introduction and notes call for a good deal of rummaging about 
amongst my papers and I cannot therefore say in advance when it will be 
done. 
When printing Marx’s articles, please note that, in the original, 
Konstitution, Klasse, Kollision, etc. are generally spelt with a ‘C but also 
probably with a ‘K’. Please put ‘K’ throughout; that will save a great deal of 
Korrigiererei.a 
Congratulations on your maiden speech; 512 it will have made the bour-
geois pretty furious!

Dear Fischer, 
I enclose the titles for the pamphleta as well as for the chapters. In order to 
complete the three article s it will be necessary to add the passages on France

then the passage on pp. 150/153b as shown, then a line of dots indicating the

Dear Julius, 
One Theodor Barlen,a the bearer of a card from the Dortmund club, has 
called on me seeking assistance. He is a deserter, having decamped from 
Spandau, and alleges that he was previously a very active party member in 
Hörde, Dortmund, etc. I referred him to the Society. 62 He came back today to 
say that the Society refused to reco mmend him to me, since they did not 
know whether the papers he produced were  his own. As I should like to have 
some information on the man so as to know whether I ought not to send him 
packing once and for all, I would ask you to tell me whether this accords 
with the facts and, once his case has been  investigated, what view they take 
of him at the Society. 516 
Many regards to your wife and yourself from

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
[London,] 26 February 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
My dear Lafargue, 
I am sending the Manuscript to you by registered post with a few 
comments—as always the translation is excellent. 517 There has been a delay 
of a few days, and this is why; in Berlin they want to reprint the three articles 
by Marx on the events in France in 1848-49 (published in 1850 in the Revue 
de la Nouvelle Gazette Rhénanea and this cannot be done without an 
introduction; 507 this introduction has become quite long, since besides a 
general review of the events since that date, it would be necessary to explain 
why we were right to expect the imminent and definitive victory of the 
proletariat, why that has not come about, and to what point events have 
modified the way we saw things then. This is important because of the new 
laws which are threatening us in Germany. 428 A Reichstag Commission is 
attempting to transform all the articles of the penal code into rubber articles 
which are applicable or not, depending on the political party to which the 
defendant belongs. Arguments in favour of an act decl ared criminal, etc. will 
be punished if they are made in circumstances which could justify the 
opinion that the accused wished to provoke or incite imitation! etc., etc. that 
is, you who are socialist will be punish ed for having said something which

a Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue.

clerical may say with impunity. The clericals in the commission are worse 
than the government itself. Just imagine, they are requesting two years in 
prison for anyone who denies in public or in the press the existence of god or 
the immortality of the soul. 
This is a fury of reaction wholly without purpose, and absolutely inex-
plicable except on the supposition that all these gentlemen are threatened by a 
coup d’état. This coup d’état is openly preached by top-ranking officials. 
Constantin Rössler, ministerial counsellor, has called for it in a brochure.a 
Boguslawski, a retired general, has just done the same thing.b The liberals and 
clericals know that, faced with such  determination on the part of the 
government, there is nothing left for them but to submit. In the presence of 2 
million socialist electors, these gentlemen do not have the courage to resist a 
coup d’état openly—the government uses this threat to disarm them, and they 
will vote just to ‘save’ the constitu tion and domestic peace! Wait and see, 
they will vote for all the taxes, all the battleships, all the new regiments 
requested by Williamc—if the electors do not become involved. For our 
bourgeois deputies are so cowardly that  even the courage of cowardice may 
prove lacking. 
In any case, we are striding towards a cris is, if there can be a crisis in this 
Germany of the Bourgeoisie, where ever ything is blunted. What is certain is 
that there will be a new age of persecution for our friends. As for us, our 
policy should be not to let ourselves be  provoked at this point; we would be 
fighting without the least chance of succe ss, and we would be bled like Paris 
in 1871, whereas in two or three years our forces may have doubled, as under 
the exceptional law. 15 Today our Party would be fighting alone against all 
the others, rallied around the government unde r the banner of social order; in 
two or three years we will have on our side the peasants and the petty-
bourgeois crushed by taxation. The battle  corps does not engage in frontline 
battles but reserves itself for the critical moment. 
Anyway, we shall see how it ends. 
How ironical that you, one of the most French writers of our age, should 
be doomed to be published almost always in German! And what German! 
The translators of Berlin and Stuttgart display a truly Germanic heaviness.

We have been without water for 15 days, the pipe beneath our road is

The preface to the 3rd volume has been published in Italian in La Rassegna

passages on Loria with a voluptuousness which bursts through each line. On 
the other hand, Loria has written a critique of the 3rd volume in the Nuova 
Antologia which is of unequalled superficiality. 15 1st volume: Napoleon I, 
2nd: the king of Rome, tubercular, 3rd: Louis Bonaparte II I. In Germany, 
Werner Sombart, a Berlin professor and a rather eclectic Marxist, has written 
a good article on the 3rd volume.c How are things progressing for 1st May?

My dear Plekhanov, 
Everything was arranged eight days ago, Veraa wrote to me and said that 
she would be delighted to be treated by Freyberger. He went to see her eight 
days ago yesterday, and has since been twice. He discovered that she had a 
severe case of bronchitis, and has pr escribed the necessary medicines. 
However, he says that what she needs most is a different diet.

She should eat meat instead of fru it jellies and other vegetable foods. 
Freyberger is out at the moment, so I will return to the question of her health 
before finishing this letter. 
Now, since you have made me more or less responsible for the state of her 
health, you must tell me if she has need of money. If she has, I would ask you 
to permit me to offer you some for her, however little, at least during her 
illness, I will send you, say, five pounds to begin with, that you can persuade 
her to accept as coming from you, so that I do not come into it at all. You 
could tell her that you have sent her this money to remove any excuse for 
refusing to change her diet, and that Freyberger has said that she must do so. 
Or perhaps you can find another excuse. 
I will not have the time to read  the critical review of my booka in Russian 
Heritage.b I have already seen enough on this subject in the issue for January 
1894. 520 As for Danielson, I fear that there is nothing to be done with him. I 
sent him by letter post 25 the Russian material from Internationales aus dem 
Volketaat, and in particular the 1894 appendix, which was written, in part, 
directly with him in view. 522 He has received it but, as you see, it is useless. 
There is no way of discussing with this generation of Russians to which he 
belongs, and which still believes in the spontaneous-communist mission 
which distinguishes Russia, the true Holy Russ,c from other profane peoples. 
As for the rest, in a country such as yours, where largescale modern 
industry is grafted onto the primitive peasant commune, and where all the 
intermediary stages of civilisation are represented simultaneously, in a 
country which, in addition, is surr ounded more or less effectively by an 
intellectual wall of China erected by despotism, it is scarcely surprising if the 
most bizarre and impossible combinations of ideas are produced. Take the 
poor devil Flerovsky, who imagines that tables and beds think, but have no 
memory. It is a phase the country must  pass through. Little by little, with the 
growth of the towns, the isolation of men of talent will disappear, and with it 
these mental aberrations caused by loneliness, the inconsistency of the 
patchy knowledge of these curious thinkers, and also a little, in the 
Narodniki,d by the despair of seeing their hopes evaporate. Indeed, one ex-
terrorist Narodnikd would end quite appropriately by becoming a tsarist.

To join in these polemics I would have to read a vast literature, keep up to 
date, and reply. This would then take up all my time for a whole year, and the 
only useful result would be that I would probably know Russian considerably 
better than I do now, but I am asked to do the same for Italy on the question 
of l’illustrea Loria. And I am already overwhelmed with work! 
Jaurès is on the right road. He is learning Marxism, and he should not be 
hurried too much. However, he has already made good progress, much more 
than I had dared hope. 518 As for the rest, let us not require too much 
orthodoxy! The party is too large, and the theory of Marx has become too 
widespread for relatively isolated muddle headed persons to do too much 
harm in the West. In your part of the world it is different, as it was with us in 
1845-59. 
I share your opinion as regards Nicholas. 13 The ‘Zemsky Sobor’c will

Lütgenau of Dortmund on the same subject,a which I should like to have 
back. The man is the right Barlen, Barlwin being, presumably, merely a 
misnomer by people who have never seen the name in writing. He was able 
to give the name of the confidential agent Bochum, and also confirmed what 
Meyer had written concerning Kritz ler and the money—although that 
money, ten marks, he said, had fallen into the hands of the police. On the 
first occasion I gave him three shillings and, when he came back today, ten 
shillings, but he said he would have to give it all to his landlord and would 
then be penniless, so I gave him anot her five shillings, eighteen shillings in 
all, but even that will leave him in di re straits—he’s living in a robber’s den 
in the seamen’s quarter, and is suffering from laryngitis and can’t talk, so 
that I wasn’t able to subject him to a long interrogation. 
Even if the Society 62 is unable to do anything else, it could at least take 
care of the poor devil to the extent of getting him out of the seamen’s district 
and helping him to find lodgings in wh ich he wouldn’t be so exploited and 
from which he could look around for work; and surely the chaps could give 
him a modicum of assistance. He should, at any rate, have an address to 
which letters could be sent. Anything that goes to his present diggings 
probably falls into the clutches of the landlord. In view of your illness and 
the Coheniad, 524 I would have come to see you myself about this business, 
but I am again suffering from one of those attacks I get in the spring and 
which temporarily prevent me from walking. 
Apropos of which, I should like to say how very sorry I am that you and 
your wife should be ill. I wish you a speedy recove ry and congratulate you 
on the merciless thrashing you inflicted on the great anarchist.b Let him take

ENGELS TO EDUARD VAILLANT 
IN PARIS 
London, 5 March 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear citizen Vaillant, 
I was unable to reply sooner to your letter of 8th January—at the moment 
our friends in Germany are having to hurry as much as possible with the 
publication of all works, brochures, articles, etc., now in preparation before 
the new reactionary legislation which is now threatening them is enforced. 428 
That has kept me, and is still keeping me, busy from morning to night with 
both literary work and the accompanying correspondence. 
To return to your draft laws, 480 the first, No. 384, agricultural delegates, 
deals with an institution of indisputable importance; as a means of 
propaganda among farm workers it will ha ve a very favourable effect; but it 
has no chance of becoming law, particul arly in France, wh ere the inspection 
of factories is still so neglected. 
No. 928, communal agricultural land. This draft goes into too much detail 
for me to pass knowledgeable judgement on it. First of all one would need to 
know whether, in the great majority of cases, this communal land does not 
consist of forests, moorland, heath or, at very most, land suitable only for 
grazing, and where agriculture proper cannot be practiced to advantage. Such 
is the case in Germany and, if I am not  mistaken, in a large part of northern 
France. In these cases, farming such land, unless kept within very narrow 
territorial confines, would risk falling into the errors of the National 
Workshops of 1848. 525 However, as I have just said, one needs very 
specialised knowledge to form an opinion on this subject. 
No. 933, an eight-hour working day and a minimum wage for workers, 
etc., employed by the state, corresponds more or less to what has been 
instituted here by the County Council, and in part also by the ministries of 
war and the navy. A measure very useful both as an example for the 
capitalists, and as a means of propaganda; however, the day before yesterday 
the workers abandoned the County Council Progressives who had 
=====第480页=====
454 Letters-1895  
introduced these measures. Three of these progressives have been black-
balled because tiny minorities (50 to 300 votes) were cast for ‘socialist’ 
candidates who are more or less ‘revolutionary’, but these minorities were 
sufficient to ensure the electi on of reactionary ‘moderates’. 526 
No. 939, ministry of labour, etc. This subdivision of work, which would 
remove some of the functions of the ministry of the interior and unite them 
with new functions hitherto neglected seems to me to be very useful. As for 
the details of the attributes of the new ministry, we can discuss this at greater 
length when the idea become s feasible in practice. 
I see these proposals simply as a means of propaganda, since with the 
present house there is no chance of s eeing them accepted. From this point of 
view,  we would  first have to assure  ourselves  of their efficacy,  and then 
determine whether or not they might be of interest for future action by the 
party when we are in a position to pro ceed to positive legislative activity. It 
is from this angle that I have formulated my criticism, and here I find just 
one point that seems to me to be dubious; whether it is wise to promise 40 
million annually to the peasants in a form and for a purpose so clearly 
defined. The peasants could one day present us with this promissory note, 
and at a time when we might have better uses for such a sum. 
Thank you for your comments concerning Wroblewskia. I have calculated 
that the roughly 45 socialist deputies receive a total of 400,000 fr. annually 
from the state, and that it would not perhaps be wholly impossible to provide 
on the basis of this sum, an annual income of, say, 1,200 francs to the sole 
surviving general of the Commune. I am perfectly well aware that the 
requests made by electoral constituenci es on the funds of their deputies are 
not very reasonable, but here it seems to  me to be a question of the honour of 
the whole of revolutionary France. It will be difficult to make the world 
understand that the survivors of a nd successors to the Commune are 
represented in the house by 45 deputies, and that a party of this size is not, 
however, capable of guaranteeing its most senior general against the most 
extreme poverty. And indeed, I still dare to hope that it will be found pos-
sible to use this means of enabling him to live out his life, without exposing 
him to the humiliation of a public subscription. 
Here socialist sentiment (it is far more a sentiment than a clear idea) is 
continuing to make progress among the masses, but the existing or-
ganisations and their leaders are also continuing with the disputes and 
a See this volume, p. 420

rivalries that keep them powerless. It is a matter for despair for those who do 
not know the English character; in any case the European continent would 
seem about to give the English the impetus it so needs. That band of 
swindlers who govern and exploit Fran ce shamelessly will not retain support 
much longer. The same is true for Italy, where bribery and corruption is even 
more shameless. In Germany, everything is leading to a crisis, generals and 
high-ranking officials are openly calling for a coup d’état. The end of the 
century is taking a decidedly revolutionary  turn. In France, the socialists are 
the only serious and honourable party, in Germany they are the only real 
opposition party; if a crisis comes, ther e will be no other party to turn to 
except this. In Austria, everyone agrees that the socialists will enter 
parliament, and it only remains to decide through which door. And in Russia, 
little Nicholas 11 has done us the service of making revolution absolutely 
inevitable. 
Yours sincerely,

My dear Sir, 
I am very sorry, in reply to your kind letter of Jan. 29th, to inform you that

deductions from the state of landed property in Russia such as might be 
useful to the Russian translator. 527 All I have been able to find

are simple and very voluminous extracts from Russian sources statistical and 
generally economical, but, and this more or less against his habit, not 
interspersed with observations of his own. 
I enclose you a letter received from Ber lin for you, and am requested by 
the Mr. Engels mentioned in it to complete it by the following bits of 
information. Mr. Engels received some  time ago an inquiry from a Dr. Lux 
who writes on economic subjects: whether the Essaysa were worth 
translating, and if so, would he do something to assist the publication of a 
German translation? to which he replied, that he was very desirous of seeing 
a German translation brought out, and that not only would he recommend the 
same for publication to Dietz, but also very gladly write an article upon it, 
when brought out, in the Neue Zeit, pointing out the importance of the results 
of your inquiries, but at the same time also stating that he differed from some 
of the conclusions arrived at by you. At the same time he stated, that he, 
Engels, had no right whatever to authorise a translation, but that the 
translator, a friend of Dr. Lux, had better apply to you direct for your 
permission. To avoid indiscretion, he insisted that the letter to you should be 
sent through him. 
The translator, a young Russianb in Berlin, was said to be capable of 
undertaking the work (Dr. Lux’s wife is a Russian lady), and Dr. Lux has 
promised to revise the German text in order to insure correctness. The 
translator is also said to have occupied himself with economical subjects, so 
as to be no stranger to the contents of your book. 
The letter enclosed seems to assume that your consent has already been 
given, at least I cannot find in it any tr ace of a formal request to you to that 
effect. I know that some young Russians abroadc are of opinion that such is 
an unnecessary formality, but such is not my opinion, and if you feel 
inclined to entertain at all Mr. Konov’s proposal, I think a hint in that 
direction might do the young man good. 
As to myself I know nothing at all of the intended translation. 
If you will kindly send me your reply to Mr Konov, I will see that it is 
forwarded at once. 528 
Yours very sincerely

ENGELS TO RICHARD FISCHER 
IN BERLIN 
[London,] 8 March 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Fischer, 
I have taken as much account as possible of your grave objections al-
though I cannot for the life of me see what is objectionable about, say, half of 
the instances you cite. 529 For I cannot after all assume that you intend to 
subscribe heart and soul to ab solute legality, legality under any 
circumstances, legality even vis-à-vis laws infringed by their promulgators, 
in short, to the policy of turning the left cheek to him, who has struck you on 
the right. True, the Vorwärts sometimes expends almost as much energy on 
repudiating revolution as once it did—and may soon do again—on 
advocating the same. But I cannot regard that as a criterion. 
My view is that you have nothing to gain by advocating complete ab-
stention from force. Nobody would believe you, nor would any party in any 
country go so far as to forfeit the right to resist illegality by force of arms. 
I also have to take account of the fact that my stuff is read by foreigners as 
well—Frenchmen, Englishmen, Swiss,  Austrians, Italians, etc.—and I 
simply cannot compromise myself to that extent in their eyes. 
I have therefore accepted your amendm ents with the fo llowing exceptions: 
1. Slip 9, re the masses, now reads: ‘t hey must have realised what they are 
coming out for’.a—2. next paragraph: the whole sentence about going into 
battle deleted; your suggestion c ontained an outright mistake. The slogan 
‘going into battle’ is used daily by the French, Italians, etc., if 
Cf. present edition, Vol. 27, p. 520  
=====第484页=====
458 Letters- 1895 
with less serious intent.—3. Slip 10:  ‘Social Democratic subversion which 
presently owes its existence to’; you wish to remove the ‘presently, thus 
changing present into permanent, and relatively into absolutely valid, tactics. 
This I will not and cannot do without maki ng an eternal ass of myself. I shall 
therefore avoid the contradiction of terms and say: ‘Social Democratic 
subversion to which it is of very great benefit just now to abide by the law.’a 
Why you should see anything dangerous in the allusion to Bismarck’s 
procedure in 1866, when the constituti on was infringed, I find utterly in-
comprehensible. If ever there was an argumentum ad hominem,b I should say 
that this was it. However, I bow to your wishes. 
Well, I can go so far and no further. I have done everything in my power 
to spare you embarrassment in debate. But you would be better advised to 
adhere to the standpoint that the obligation to abide by the law is a legal, not 
a moral one, as indeed, has been so nicely demonstrated to you by 
Boguslawskic (who has got the pip); and that it ceases absolutely when those 
in power break the law. But you people—one or two of you at any rate—
have been weak enough not to oppose your adversaries’ pretensions as you 
ought to have done, and to accept the oblig ation to abide by the law as being 
also a moral one and binding under all circumstances, instead of telling 
them: ‘You are in power, it is you who make the laws; if we infringe them, 
you can deal with us in accordance with those laws and we must put up with 
it, that and nothing more—we have no fu rther obligations, and you no further 
rights.’ That’s how the Catholics be haved in the face of the May Laws, 530 
likewise the Old Lutherans in Meissen and likewise that Mennonite 531 
soldier who figures in all the newspa pers, and it’s a standpoint you people 
must not betray. The Subversion Bill 428 is in any case doomed; a thing of 
that sort cannot even be formulated, let alone put into practice and, given the 
power to do so, the chaps will manage to muzzle you and harass you in any 
case. 
If, however, your intention is to make the chaps in the government see 
that we only want to bide our time because we are not yet strong enough to 
help ourselves and because the army  is not yet thoroughly disaffected—if 
such is your intention,  
My dear fellows, then why the eternal bragging in your press about the 
party’s victories and the enormous strides it is

making? Those chaps know as well as we do that victory is almost within our 
grasp and that in a few years’ time th ere will be no stopping us, and that is 
why they are already anxious to get us by the scruff, though unfortunately 
they don’t know how. Nothing we say can alter that fact, and they know all 
this as well as we do; they likewise know that, once power is ours, we shall 
use it for our own purposes, not theirs. 
So when next there’s a general debate in plenary session, mind you uphold 
the right of resistance to as good effect as did Boguslawski on our behalf, and 
do not forget that your audience also comprises old revolutionaries—French, 
Italian, Spanish, Hungarian, and English—and that the time may again 
come—how soon, no one can tell—when the deletion of the word ‘legal’, 
effected donkey’s years ago at Wyden, 343 will really be consummated. Take 
a look at the Austrians whose threat to use force, should suffrage not soon be 
forthcoming, could hardly be plainer! 523 Think of your own unlawful actions 
at the time of the Anti-Socialist Law, 15 a law they would like to foist upon 
you again. Legality for so long as and to  the extent that it suits your book, but 
not legality at any price, not even as a manner of speech!

ENGELS TO WERNER SOMBART 
IN BRESLAU 
London, 11 March 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Sir, 
In replying to your note of the 14th of last month, I should like to thank 
you for so kindly sending me your book on Marxa; I had already read it with 
great interest in the volume of the Archivb which Dr H. Braun was good 
enough to send me and was glad at long last to find such appreciation of 
Capitalc at a German university. Needless to say, I cannot identify myself 
with all the expressions into which y ou have transposed Marx’s exposition. 
In particular, it seems to me that the definitions of the concept of value, given 
by you on pp. 576 and [5] 77, are rather too generalised; for one thing, I 
should delimit them historically by expressly confining them to the economic 
phase in which alone there has and c ould have been any question of value 
hitherto—to the social form s in which exchange of commodities and 
production of commodities exist; prim itive communism was innocent of 
value. And in the second place the propos ition would also seem to me to be 
susceptible of a conceptually narrower formulation. But this would take us 
too far afield and on the whole you are certainly right in what you say. 
On p. 586, however, you appeal directly to me and I could not but laugh at 
the unconcerned way in which you hold a pistol to my head. But you need 
not worry—I am not going to ‘contradict you flat’. The conceptual 
transitions whereby Marx arrives at th e general and equal rate of profit from 
the various values produced in individual capitalist concerns, namely s/c = 
s/(c+v), are wholly foreign to the consciousness of the individual capitalist. 
In so far as they have any historical parallel or any reality outside our own 
heads, this consists in, say the fact that the individual constituents of the 
amount of surplus value produced by capitalist

Gesetzgebung und Statistik. - c Volume II I

Letters- 1895 461 
A., over and above the rate of profit or his share of the total surplus value, 
pass into the pocket of capitalist B. whose own output of surplus value is 
normally less than the dividend accruing to  him. But this process takes place 
objectively and unconsciously, in the nature of things, and only now, when 
we have attained to a proper consciousne ss of that process, can we judge how 
much labour it has cost. Had the creation of the average rate of profit 
demanded the conscious collaboration of the individual capitalists, and had 
the individual capitalist known that he was producing surplus value and how 
much, and that in many cases he would have to surrender part of his surplus 
value, the connection between surplus value and profit would, of course, 
have been more or less clear from the start, and would certainly be found in 
Adam Smith if not already in Petty. 
As Marx sees it, the whole of past history, so far as major events are 
concerned, is an unconscious process, i.e. those events and the consequences 
thereof are not deliberate; either the supernumeraries of history have wanted 
something that was the diametrical opposite of what was achieved, or else 
that achievement entailed consequences quite other than those that had been 
foreseen. If we apply this to political  economy, we find that each individual 
capitalist is in pursuit of bigger profits for himself. Bourgeois economics 
reveals that this pursuit of bigger profits on the part of each individual 
capitalist results in a general and equal rate of profit, an approximately equal 
rate of profit for all. But neither capitalists nor bourgeois economists are 
aware that the real purpose of that pursu it is the equal percentual distribution 
of the total surplus value over capital as a whole. 
But how did this process of equalisation really come about? That is a very 
interesting point about wh ich Marx himself has little to say. But Marx’s 
whole way of thinking [Auffassungsweise] is not so much a doctrine as a 
method. It provides, not so much ready-made dogmas, as aids to further 
investigation and the method for such investigation. Here, then, is a piece of 
work to be done which Marx himself did not attempt in his first draft. Here, 
for a start, we have the statements on pp. 153-156, II I, Ia which also have 
some bearing on your rendering of the concept of value and prove that that 
concept has, or had, more reality than you ascribe to it. In the early days of 
exchange when products gradually ch anged into commodities, exchanges 
were made in proportion to value. For the labour 
a See present edition, Vol. 37, pp.174-76; see also, pp. 882-84

expended on two articles was the sole criterion of quantitative comparison. 
At that time, then, value existed in an immediate and real sense. That this 
immediate realisation of value ceased  in exchange, that it now no longer 
exists, we know. And I do not suppose you will have any particular difficulty 
in tracing the intermediate stages, at any rate in broad outline, that led from 
the above-mentioned real and immediate value to value as represented in the 
capitalist mode of production, value wh ich is so thoroughly well-concealed 
that our economists can happily deny its existence. A genuinely historical 
exposition of this process—which, t hough admittedly requiring a great deal 
of research, holds out the prospect of correspondingly rewarding results—
would be a most valuable pendant to Capital. 534 
Finally, I must again thank you for the high esteem in which you must 
hold me if you take the view that I could have turned Volume II I into 
something better than it is. But I am unable to share that opinion and believe 
I have done my duty by presenting Marx in Marx’s own words, even at the 
risk of expecting the reader to do rather more thinking for himself. 
Yours very truly,

Dear Schmidt, 
I have before me your two letters of the 13th of November last and of the 
1st of this month. Let me begin with the most recent, No. 2. 
=====第489页=====
Letters- 1895 463 
So far as Fireman is concerned, you had better leave well alone. 535 Lexis 
had simply posed the question 536 as you did in Σs/Σ(c+v). He is the only one 
to have gone a step further along the right road in as much as he classified 
the progression s/(c’+v’) + s”/(c”+v”) + s’”/(c”‘+v’”) ... etc ., set out by you 
and divided it, according to the varying composition of capital, into groups of 
the branches of production between which equalisation only comes about as 
a result of competition. The fact that this was the next important step will be 
evident to you from Marx’s own text in which, up to that point, the process is 
exactly the same. Fireman’s mistake was to break off here and rest on his 
laurels, which is why he necessa rily remained unnoticed until the booka itself 
came out.—But there’s no need for you to worry. You have every reason to 
be content. After all, you discovered for yourself why it is that the rate of 
profit tends to fall and how commercial profit is created—and discovered, 
not just two thirds as did Fireman the rate of profit, but the whole bally thing. 
Your letter, I think, sheds some light on why you allowed yourself to be 
side-tracked when it came to the rate of profit. In it I find you lapsing into 
detail in just the same way, and for this I blame the eclectic method of 
philosophising endemic at German uni versities since 1848, a method which 
loses sight of the whole, and all too often goes astray by indulging in almost 
endless and unprofitable speculation on minutiae. Now it so happens that 
your earlier studies of classical philosophy revolved primarily around Kant, 
and Kant was more or less compelled by the then state of philosophising in 
Germany and by his own antipathy to Wolf’s pedantic Leibnizianism to 
make what appeared to be formal con cessions to Wolfian speculation. It is 
thus I explain your tendency, also apparent from your epistolatory digression 
on the law of value, to become engro ssed in minutiae; hence your occasional 
failure, or so it seems to me, to see the wood for the trees, which is why you 
reduce the law of value to a fiction, a necessary fiction, in much the same 
way as Kant reduced the existence of G od to a postulate of practical reason. 
Your objections to the law of value apply to all concepts regarded from 
the standpoint of reality. The identity  of thinking and being, to use a 
Hegelian expression, corresponds in all respects to your example of the circle 
and the polygon. In other words, the c oncept of an object and its reality run 
side by side like two asymptotes which, though constantly 
a Vol. II I of Capital  
=====第490页=====
464 Letters- 1895 
converging, will never meet. The differe nce between the two is the selfsame 
difference which is responsible for the fact that the concept is not 
immediately and ipso facto reality and reality is not immediately its own 
concept. Because a concept is by its na ture essentially a concept, hence does 
not ipso facto and prima faciea correspond to the reality from which it has 
had first to be abstracted, that con cept is always something more than a 
fiction, unless you declare all reasoned conclusions to be fictive on the 
grounds that they correspond to reality only in a very circuitous way and 
even then only approximately, like converging asymptotes. 
Is it otherwise with the general rate of profit? At no time is it more than an 
approximation. Should it ever prove to be absolutely identical in two 
separate undertakings and should both achieve exactly the same rate of profit 
in a given year, it would be purely fortuitous; in reality rates of profit vary 
from business to business and year to year, according to circumstances, while 
the general rate exists only as the average achieved by a large number of 
businesses over a succession of years. If, however, we were to insist that the 
rate of profit—say, 14.876934... be exactly  the same down to the last decimal 
point in every business every year, on pain of being reduced to a fiction, we 
should be grossly mistaking the nature of the rate of profit and of economic 
laws generally—they none of them have any reality save as an 
approximation, a tendency, an average, but not as immediate reality. This is 
due partly to the fact that their action is frustrated by the simultaneous action 
of other laws, but also to some extent by their nature as concepts. 
Or take the law of wages, the realisation of the value of the power of 
labour, a value which is only, and even then not always, realised as an av-
erage and varies from locality to locality, indeed from branch to branch, 
according to the standard of living cu stomary in each. Or ground rent, which 
represents the surplus profit, in excess of the general rate, arising from a 
monopolisation of a natural force. Here, too, real surplus profit and real rent 
do not by any means automatically correspond, but do so only approximately 
and on an average. 
Exactly the same thing applies to the law of value and the distribution of 
surplus value through the rate of profit. 
1. Both come closest to full realisation only in as much as capitalist 
production has everywhere been fully implemented, i.e. society has been

reduced to modern classes of landowners, capitalists (industrialists and 
traders) and workers, all intermediate  stages having been eliminated. That 
has not yet happened even in Engla nd nor will it ever happen—we shouldn’t 
let things get to that pitch. 
2. Profit, including rent, has a number of constituents: 
a) profit from sharp practice which you discount in your algebraic sum; 
b) profit from an increase in value of stocks (e.g. what is left of the 
previous harvest when the next one fails). In theory this ought also to 
equalise out, so long as it has not already been discounted by a fall in the 
value of other commodities, for either the capitalist buyer’s contribution 
must be equal to the seller’s gain, or else, where means of subsistence for 
workers are concerned, wages must even tually rise. The most significant of 
these rises in value are, however, not lasting ones, hence equalisation takes 
place only over an average of years and in  very incomplete form and, as is 
well known, at the expense of the workers; they produce more surplus value 
because their labour power is not paid for in full; 
c) the total amount of surplus value from which, however, we must again 
deduct that portion that is presented to the buyer, especially at times of crisis 
when overproduction is reduced to its true content of socially necessary 
labour. 
From this it necessarily follows that the total profit and the total surplus 
value can correspond only approximately. If, however, you also consider that 
neither the total surplus value nor the total capital are constant quantities but 
variables which change from day to day, then any correspondence between 
the rate of profit and Σs/Σ(c+v), other than an approximate progression, and 
any coincidence of the total price and total value other than one which 
constantly tends towards, and yet as constantly tends away from, unity, will 
be seen to be a sheer impossibility. In other words, the unity of concept and 
phenomenon turns out to be an essentially endless process, and so indeed it 
is, in this case as in every other. 
Has feudalism, then, ever corresponded to its concept? Having begun in 
the Kingdom of the Western Franks, 537 been further developed in Normandy 
by the Norwegian invaders, and taken a stage further in England and the 
south of Italy by the Norman French, it came closest to its concept—in the 
ephemeral Kingdom of Jerusalem, a relic of which, the Assises de Jérusalem, 538

merely because it was in Palestine alone  that it achieved a short-lived exis-

tence in fully classical form—a nd even then largely on paper? 
Or are the concepts that prevail in the natural scie nces fictive because they 
by no means always correspond to reality? From the moment we accept the 
theory of evolution, all our concepts of organic life correspond only 
approximately to reality. Otherwise there would be no change; if the day 
should ever come when concept and r eality coincide completely in the 
organic world, evolution will cease. The concept ‘fish’ embraces life under 
water and breathing through gills; how is it possible to evolve from fish to 
amphibian without infringing that concept? And infringed it has been; we 
know of a whole number of fish whose air-bladders have evolved into lungs 
and which are thus able to breathe air. How is it possible to evolve from 
oviparous reptile to viviparous mammal without bri nging one or both 
concepts into conflict with  reality? And in fact we have, in the monotremata, 
an entire sub-class of oviparous mammals—in Manchester in 1843, I saw the 
eggs of a duck-billed platypus and, in my narrow-minded arrogance, cast 
scorn on the folly of supposing that a mammal could lay eggs, and now it has 
been proven! So do not treat the concept of value in the same manner as has 
obliged me to proffer my belated apologies to the duck-billed platypus! 
In Sombart’s otherwise excellent article on Volume II P I have also found 
a similar tendency to emasculate the theory of value; evidently he, too, had 
hoped to find a rather different solution. 15 
Your article in the Centralblatt, however, is first-rate,c and your dem-
onstration—by quantitative determination—of the specific differences 
between Marx’s theory of the rate of profit and that of the earliest political 
economists, is very well done. In his wisdom, the illustrious Loria sees 
Volume II I as nothing less than an abandonment of the theory of  value,d and 
thus your article is a cut-and-dried reply. There are now two more interested 
parties, Labriola in Rome, and Lafargue, the latter having joined battle with 
Loria in the Critica Sociale. 539 If, therefore, you could send a copy to Prof. 
Antonio Labriola, Corso Vittorio E mmanuele 251, Rome, he would do his 
best to get an Italian translation of it published; and a second copy to Paul

IN VIENNA 
London, 16 March 1895 
 
Dear Victor, 
Herewith by return the information you request. Sombart’s article is very 
good,a except that his view of the law of value is impaired by some 
disappointment over the solution to the rate of profit question. He clearly 
expected a miracle, instead of which he merely found what was rational and 
that is anything but miraculous. Hence his reduction of the significance of the 
law of value to the domination of the productive force of labour as the 
determining economic power. This is all much too generalised and 
imprecise.—Little Conrad Schmidt’s article in the Sozial politisches 
Centralblatt is very good.b Eduard Bernstein’s articles were very muddle-
headedc; the man is still neurasthenic and, what is more, scandalously over-
worked. Having too many other things on hand, he left the article on one side 
and then was suddenly dunned for it by K. Kautsky. 
Since you want to swot away at Capital II  and II I while you’re in quod, 
542 let me give you a few hints to lighten your task.

Book II . Part I. Read Chap. I carefully, after which you can more or less 
skim through Chaps 2 and 3; pay closer attention to Chap. 4, it being a 
resume; 5 and 6 are easy, 6 in particular being concerned with incidental 
matters. 
Part II . Chaps 7-9 are important. 10 and 11 exceptionally so. Likewise 12, 
13 and 14. On the other hand 15, 16 and 17 need only be read cursorily to 
begin with. 
Part II I. Is an absolutely first-rate exposé of a subject which has not been 
dealt with since the days of the physiocrats, namely the entire circulation of 
commodities and money in capitalist society—brilliant as to content, but 
terribly ponderous as to form, firstly b ecause put together from two versions 
using two different methods  and, secondly, because version 2 was completed 
under duress, namely an illness involving chronic insomnia. If I were you, I 
should keep that to the very last, after an initial reading of Volume II I. Also, 
it is the one you can most easily dispense with so far as your work is 
concerned. 
Now for Volume II I. 
Important in Part I are Chaps 1-4; on the other hand, Chaps 5, 6 and 7 are 
less important so far as the general context is concerned, so not very much 
time should be spent on them to start off with. 
Part II . Most important are Chaps 8, 9, 10. 11 and 12 to be treated 
cursorily. 
Part II I. Most important, the whole of it, 13-15. 
Part IV. Likewise most important, though 16-20 also easy to read. 
Part V. Most important, Chaps 21-27. Less so, Chap 28. Chap. 29 
important. Chaps 30-32 not, on the whole, important for your purposes, but 
Chaps 22 and 34 important as soon as they turn to paper money, etc., 35 
important as regards international rates of exchanges; 36 of great interest to 
you, and also easy to read. 
Part VI. Ground Rent. 37 and 38 important. 39 and 40 less so, but 
nevertheless not to be skipped. 41-43 demand rather less attention. 
(Differential rent II , individual cases.) 44-47 are again important and also, 
on the whole, easy to read. 
Part VII  very fine; unfortunately truncated and, moreover, strongly 
symptomatic of insomnia. 
So if you make a thorough study of the essentials by following the above, 
and devote less attention initially to what is of lesser importance (preferably 
having first reread the essential bits of Vol. I), you will get a 
=====第496页=====

general view of the whole and will afterwards find it easier to digest the 
passages to which you have devoted less attention. 
Your news about the papera pleased us very much. The main thing is 
political efficacity; financial efficacity is bound to follow, and will be 
achieved far more easily and quickly once the former is assured. It is with 
pleasure I detect your hand in the notes on electoral reform on the front page 
532—there you have the FULCRUM for the efficacity you need. 
As a result of the old trouble which comes to plague me periodically, es-
pecially in springtime, I am again somewhat lame but less so than usual, the 
attack being milder and, in about a fortnight I should, I think, be rid of it 
without any need for sea air as in 1893 and 1894. 
The movement over here may be summed up as follows: Amongst the 
masses, progress is steady if instinctive, and the tendency is adhered to; the 
moment it comes to giving conscious expression to that instinct and to that 
impulsive tendency, however, their sectarian leaders set about it in so stupid 
and narrow-minded a way as to make one feel like hitting out left, right and 
centre. But I suppose it’s just the typical Anglo-Saxon way of going about 
things. 
Many regards, 
Yours,

6) I do not know what associations you mean. On the whole, the Workers’ 
Union 548 and the Democratic Association worked hand in hand in Cologne, 
although the former was more radical than the latter. As for what had been 
going on before our arrival, at the time when the Workers’ Union had been 
led by Dr. Gottschalk, I can say nothing definite about it. 
7) If by the Central Association 549 you mean the central section of 
democratic associations, led by the Frankfurt Left, I must say the Rhenish 
democrats soon lost trust in it and made themselves independent. 
8) We were on the same good terms with Becker as with the other 
bourgeois democratic leaders in Cologne, without making a secret of the fact 
that we were going considerably furt her than they and without expecting 
them to unconditionally support the stance taken by the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung. The majority of them, Becker included, were not contributors to the 
paper, except, at the most, for publishing short, usually signed, articles from 
time to time in the local news section (then printed ‘under the line’). You will 
often come across the initials H. B. 550 there. After the onset  of reaction, in the 
autumn of 1848, democracy became more  radical and Becker also drew 
closer to us. But he did not work more for the paper then either. 
9) I’ve no knowledge of this at all. 551 I was already gone by then, we left 
Cologne in May. 
 
10) After we had gone, Becker and Heinrich Burgers founded the 
Westdeutsche Zeitung, one might say on the inheritance of the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung? 552 
11) I have no further material on the Communist trial 553 concerning

Becker specifically. Becker had join ed the Communist League, which was 
set up anew on the Continent at the end of 1849 or the beginning of 1850, 
and sat on the Cologne district authority, which was entrusted with the 
functions of central author ity after the split in London. 
12) I know of no attempts to free Becker while he was on remand. If 
anything of the kind was contemplated, certainly good care was taken not to 
mention it in letters to London, for it would hardly have escaped the notice of 
the Prussian postal service. 
For the rest, I regret to be unable to give you any further information. I 
hope you have the latest edition (Zur ich 1885) of Marx’s revelations con-
cerning the Cologne trial,a with my introduction.b If not, you may obtain a 
copy from the bookshop of Vorwärts, 2 Beuthstrasse, Berlin; the earlier 
editions are incomplete. 
Incidentally, Becker’s involvement with the League was only an episode 
in his life, caused by the then rampant reaction. With the return of calmer 
times he again became what he had b een previously, a bourgeois democrat, 
and, as you will know, went through a ll the changes undergone by German, 
and particularly Prussian, bourgeois democracy. This attitude stemmed from 
his whole nature, so I am far removed from seeing any sort of careerism in it; 
on the contrary, if he had tried to remain more radical and carry the 
communist episode on, he would have mi ssed his calling. In this he differed, 
very favourably, from Miquel. 
I hope these notes will be of use to you.

ENGELS TO PABLO IGLESIAS 
IN MADRID 
[Draft]  
London, 16 March 1895 
 
Dear friend Iglesias, 
I could not answer your letter of 19 October 1894 earlier because I did not 
know whether or not you had come out of Malaga prison; 554 nor could I 
answer your letter of 1 February, being busy finishing some publicationsa for 
our people in Berlin which had to be circulated before the new repressive 
draft laws 428 became law. 
Before I got your letter of 19 Octobe r, friends in Barcelona had asked 
Comrade Eleanor Marx-Aveling to inform the British Trades-Unions of the 
Malaga strikers’ situation, and she ha d done all she could, so that nothing 
more is left for me to do. And as you know, some of the Trades-Unions 
helped. 
As regards really socialist organisations in England, they are so disunited 
and so poor that no help can be expected from them. 
I have been following the progress of this strike with great interest, 
admiring the workers’ tenacity and courage. Marquis de Larios’ name 
reminds me of an episode that occurred about 1850. 
At that time there was a firm of Larios Bros. (Jews) in Gibraltar. A British 
merchant used to send his goods to the firm on commission to be smuggled 
to other merchants on Spanish territory . Those goods were constantly seized 
by Spanish Customs, and Larios Bros, would pay the Englishman the 
guaranteed sum in insurance, as is customary in this kind of business. But 
that did not suit the Englishman, for he lost his customers in Spain and a 
substantial amount of profit. He arrived in Gibraltar to see for himself why 
those accidents always befell his goods but  never those of others. However, 
he could not find out the reason. One day as he was taking a walk in the city, 
he saw a cart lose a wheel and some boxes with goods fall to the ground and 
burst open. The boxes were

his—they bore his trade-mark—but he saw that, instead of goods, they 
contained, yes, sand. The mystery was solved. It became clear that Larios 
Bros. had always notified Spanish Customs of the dispatch of the boxes of 
sand, which had been seized, the Englishman being paid insurance; 
thereupon Larios Bros. had dispatched the goods on their own behalf by a 
safe route to their Spanish correspondents, thus pocketing without risk the 
whole profit derived from the operation. 
The enraged Englishman descended on Larios. ‘I’ll disclose all that, I’ll 
make a scandal, I’ll have you put on trial!’ ‘Why get excited, sir? We will 
pay you for your goods and make the amends you want.’ After much 
argument, the Englishman was paid a definite sum, and Larios Bros. signed 
the following statement: 
‘We, Larios Bros., are the greatest swi ndlers there are here in the city of 
Gibraltar, and we advise everybody against doing business with us, for they 
can rest assured that we would cheat them. 
‘Gibraltar, (date). 
‘Larios Bros.’ 
The statement was posted for general information in the Bourse of 
Gibraltar, where old Larios continued for another twenty years to buy and 
sell goods. 
Would the marquis be a relative of the Larios of Gibraltar?

ENGELS TO CARL HIRSCH 
IN COLOGNE 
London, 19 March 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
Dear Hirsch, 
I am willing to oblige you, 555 but only on two conditions: 1. that the 
=====第501页=====

matter remains strictly between ourselves, for otherwise I shall get a hundred 
such requests for advance criticism; and what I do for one person I cannot 
refuse to do for others—in which case I might as well throw up the sponge. 
2. That this is the last time you ask me to do anything of this kind. I get more 
things sent to me in a week than I can read in a month, but if I am to criticise 
them into the bargain, I sh all be in even worse case. 
P. 4. Onesided}. This is far less the case in big industry than in manu-
facture. On the contrary, big industry does to a large extent eliminate the 
disabling effect of manufacture, although it produces a similar effect of its 
own, which last may be exacerbated by th e intensification of labour. From 
what I know of big industry, I should say that in your case this point is given 
more emphasis than is justified by the circumstances. The division of labour 
is, and will continue to be, the chie f cause of the disablement of labour. 
P. 6. - ‘in every case overproduction, crises’. May, has a tendency to— 
realisation by no means inevitable. ‘Spiral movement’—seems to me too 
general a term. What mode of produc tion have you in mind here? ‘The 
minimum of socially necessary labour time’—if this is supposed to be the 
time needed to produce the gross social product, it is meaningless so far as 
capitalist society is concerned, since in its apportionment among individual 
workers, the industrial reserve army  is wholly left out of account. 
P. 15. ‘Everywhere’ (etc., up till the end of the sentence)—this is ex-
pressed very obscurely, to say the least and, as it stands, is a contradiction. 
First, the increase in the products of labour is said to give rise to ‘a gain as 
such’ and then to a ‘loss of value, which is at least a possibility’. This will 
not do unless explanatory and delimiting intermediate links are provided. 
P. 18. ‘The capital of the working man is his own person.’ That sounds 
very nice, but in this context the word capital loses every vestige of meaning. 
Why the devil must you go and translate things that are sensible into 
nonsensical philistine cliches? What you say here is quite beyond my 
comprehension. Similarly on p. 18, no. 2. The concentration of labour re-
sulting from improvements in machinery is all of a sudden supposed to be 
unhealthy. It may be so, and very often is, in the capitalist system but of itself 
it is no more unhealthy than is eating and digesting on the following page. 
Not only will it not cease, but we shall be able to augment it considerably 
because, with it, we shall get co mpensation for the workers. Other

incidental comments—should there ever be a second edition, I would advise 
you to substantiate what are, after all, very generalised arguments by 
providing specific examples, citing facts relating to various branches of 
industry and, in general, indicating which industries you are referring to. 
E.g., your propositions are true of the highly developed English textile 
industry only in a very limited sense. On the other hand, they may be far 
more true of Germany where big industr y is still in its infancy and is only 
just coming into its own in a whole number of branches of production in 
which old methods are being superseded  and the intensity of labour suddenly 
augmented. However, these are merely transitional stages. The main thing, 
when dealing with economic and, more especially industrial matters of this 
kind, is not to succumb to parochialis m. Seen for what they are, these 
transitional phases are of undeniable importance, but one must also recognise 
and say that that is what they are and nothing else. And your immediate 
surroundings provide you with the most splendid opportunity for presenting 
all your propositions as having been deduced from real life, while you 
yourself will learn something in the process. 
Now, do your best in the Cologne by-election 556 so that we may at least 
win here. And if by chance you should be  writing to me again, let me know if 
the old house, behind Hutmacher, where the Neue Rheinische Zeitung used to 
be, is still no. 17 and whether the owner of the sweatshop who now lives 
there is called Salomon or Lewi—I have forgotten. 
So far you have been conducti ng your battle with the Centre 71 quite 
nicely, but it seems to me that you might castigate the conduct of the Liebers 
et al in the Reichstag rather more often in your leading articles. 557 
Many regards, 
Yours, 
F.E.

Dear Kugelmann, 
The eachets cramponsa have arrived here safely and have already been put 
to use. The machine presents no difficulty to the doer-up of letters—whether 
it does to the opener thereof is something that could be elucidated for us by 
the German and Austrian postal authorities to whom we have already most 
humbly submitted several samples. Ma ny thanks. Köller will, I hope, be 
obliged to introduce a Subversion Bill 428 for the subversion of these staples

ignominiously. 
Thanks for your endeavours in the Bielefeld district. If there is anything of 
mine or, indeed of Marx’s in the Dampfboot, it is likely to be anonymous. 558

The cold suited me very well; it acted on me like a powerful tonic while it 
lasted, and I felt twenty years younger. On the other hand, it precipitated 
London as always back into an age of barbarism. The water pipes froze; we 
went on having water until the Compan y shut off supplies, whereupon the 
water froze in the mains. Ours was about four and a half to five feet down 
and when uncovered a fortnight after the thaw, was still completely frozen 
up. Then we had to wait another two days until our connecting pipe thawed 
out. At eight o’clock in the evening, a week ago today, the water at last came 
on again. We then discovered that the drains were blocked because of the 
inadequate flow of water. By the end of last week everything was back to 
normal again, after four weeks during which we had to have forty buckets of

Dear Hermann, 
Many thanks for the kind wedding invitation which I am unfortunately 
unable to accept. Apart from other obstacl es, I have again fallen prey to the 
springtime complaint which, for the past four or five years, has regularly 
crippled me for some weeks at this  season. A little rest will no doubt suffice 
to put paid to the thing, thus enabling me, a week tomorrow, to drink a glass 
of the best to ElsbethV and her bridegroom’sb health, as will be 
conscientiously done. 
Otherwise I am well and have grown more or less accustomed to the 
domestic and dietary regulations befitting an elderly gentleman—so much 
so, in fact, that any deviation there from becomes instantly apparent to me 
from all manner of little upsets and I get given the well-meant but earnest 
advice to desist from the same in future. I had never imagined

Well, I hope that, even in my absence,  you will all have a very happy day, 
and wish Elsbeth the best of luck in her new status as a married woman; also 
offspring more distinguished by their health than by their numbers.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 25 March 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Baron, 
No difficulty about a reply to your telegramm—’with pleasure’. The text 
will follow by book-post. It is in proof form and is entitled Introduction to 
Karl Marx’s ‘The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850’ by F. Engels. 
The text explains that the contents ar e a reprint of the old articles from the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Revue. My text has suffered to some extent from 
the apprehensive objections, in spired by the Subversion Bill, 428 of our 
friends in Berlin—objections of which, in the circumstances, I could not but 
take account. 529 
I at once wrote to Plekhanov to clear up the misunderstanding.a It was 
very right of you to stave off Ferri; the chap is a belletrist and sensation-
monger in no matter what field and, like most Italians, holds Loria to be a 
giant in the field of economics, an opinion the illustrious one has implanted 
in them by dint of ‘reiterated appearan ces’ (to use Ruge’s expression) and by 
a refined system of camaraderie. 
I have not read the stenographic version of Liebknecht’s militia speech 360 
and one cannot go by the newspaper re ports. A long dissertation might be 
written on the subject of militia and the standing army. If France and 
Germany were to agree gradually to turn  their armies into  militias, each with 
the same period of training, that would be that; Russia could be left to her 
own devices and Austria and Italy would be delighted to follow suit. But 
because of domestic circumstances Fr ance and Germany cannot afford to do 
this and, even if they could, it w ould not be feasible because of Alsace-
Lorraine. And that will prove the undoing of the whole of the militia 
business. 
Unfortunately your Early History of Socialism 561 hasn’t reached me yet; I 
look forward keenly to seeing it, and specially, if not exclusively, to your

account of the Anabaptists; 562 in the earlier movements, too, there is still a 
good deal to be elucidated. It is a great pity that you have not been able to 
have recourse to Czech sources on the Taborites, 563 but that would have been 
quite out of the question unless you had spent a long time in Bohemia and 
been given special access to mss. No  doubt you could fi nd someone on the 
spot, a young Czech, who would be able to help you. 
What I have seen of Ede’sa work has pleased me very much, particularly 
as regards the material and the perspec tives it opens out. On the other hand, I 
should say that he planned it in rather too much of a hurry, but that is 
something one can only judge when one has the whole thing in front of one. 
So far as you people are concerned, th ere would be considerable snags to a 
history of the International. First of all, you would have to collect the 
material from the individual countries. So far as Spain is concerned, Mora is 
now bringing it out—very much by dribs and drabs—in the feuilleton of the 
Socialista. I myself possess quite a lot on Italy up till the time of the Hague 
Congress, 115 where, however, a great deal went on behind the scenes. 
Frankel and Lafargue could probably la y hands on a fair amount of stuff on 
France up till 1870 and, so far as Switzer land is concerned, you would have 
the Tagwacht, the Vorbote, the Egalité and the Bulletin jurassien.b (Héritier’s 
articles in the Berliner Volks- Tribüne should be treated with the greatest 
circumspection; they are all written in unconscious extenuation of the 
Bakuninists; 49 so unaware was the man of what he was doing that he didn’t 
realise, until told by me, after the event, what a slap  in the face they had been 
to his spiritual fo ster-father, Beckerc). The other countries don’t really 
matter. 
For years past I have been intending to make use of the material in my 
possession for a biography of Marx and, in fact, it is this, as it happens to be 
quite the most important part, that I shall do first. A number of cir-
cumstances make this necessary. Firstly, I was personally involved during 
the crucial period, 1870-72, and can fill out the material from my own 
experience. Secondly, it is at one and the same time the most important 
episode in Marx’s public life and that least amenable to accurate portrayal 
from printed sources. Thirdly, the calumnies to be disposed of belong for the 
most part to this period. Fourthly, I am seventy-four years old

and shall have to make haste. And, fifthly, the other period during which 
Marx was publicly active (1842-62) can  perfectly well wait until later and 
even, if necessary, be depicted by someone other than myself, since public 
controversy up to the time of Herr Vogt throws light on most of it and Marx 
had so emphatically lived down the calumnies of the then vulgar democrats 
that these no longer call for individual refutation. 
I shall apply myself to this task, to which I have long been looking for-
ward, as soon as I possibly can,—indeed I only have one or two small jobs to 
do in the mean time, in effect merely the revision of the introduction to the 
new edition of the Peasant War 235 (for which I need your book too). Then I 
shall turn my back on all my correspondence (which is enormously time-
consuming) and on all incidental work (no doubt with the help of the 
Subversion Bill 428 ?!), when I should be able to manage it all right. 
Your news about the Arbeiter-Zeitung is indeed very gloomy; however, I 
believe it will come through all right. Maybe the chaps planned things on 
rather too lavish a scale at the start 377 and will now have to cut down a bit. 
But its political success seems assured and, that being so, it would be very 
strange if it didn’t eventually prove a financial success also. Electoral 
reforms 270 that would enable us to get into parliament are, I consider, a 
virtual certainty in Austria, unless a period of general reaction were suddenly 
to set in. In Berlin they would seem to be making determined efforts in that 
direction, but unfortunately no one there knows his own mind from one day 
to the next. So they may find themselves in the same boat as the recruit from 
Lancashire who, while training, was ordered by his N.C.O. to ‘slope arms—
order arms—slope arms—order—sl ope—order’. ‘I WINNOT,’ cried the 
recruit. ‘YOU WON’T?’ ‘NO, I WINNOT’, ‘YOU REFUSE TO OBEY 
YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER?’ ‘I WINNOT!’ AND WHY NOT?’ 
‘BECAUSE YOU DUNNOT KNOW YOUR OWN MIND FOR TWO 
MINUTES TOGETHER!’ 
Many regards from one household to the other. 
Yours, 
F. E.

My dear Löhr, 
If you were in danger of being flooded,  it was just the reverse with us—
four weeks without water, and at the end of the frost the canalisation blocked 
up as the result. A fine mess it was. London was thrown back into barbarism 
by this month of hard frost, and the Standard with truly British Conservatism 
congratulated us on the fact that the non-supply of water was a proof of the 
high civilisation attained here, while it pitied the uncivilised cities of the 
Continent where the water-pipes had not frozen. Well, thank goodness, it’s 
over. 
You grumble at the mythical union and real squabbles of the French 
Socialists—they are babies at that game , compared to the English. They are 
especially interesting—the English Socialists I mean—since Social 
Democratic Federation 44 and Independent Labour Party 114 fight each other 
under the cloak of a pretended harmony. This harmony goes exactly as far as 
their common hatred of John Burns, and allows the Social Democratic 
Federation to invite Keir Hardie to speak at their Commune meeting; at 
which meeting Keir Hardie  (read his speech in the Labour Leadera) directs 
hidden attacks against the Social Democratic Federation to which that body 
replies in Justice.b The Social Democratic Federation says the Independent 
Labour Party has no right to exist, the Social Democratic Federation being

only true orthodox church; and the Independent Labour Party says the Social 
Democratic Federation ought to allow itself to be absorbed in the 
Independent Labour Party. Their latest exploit was at the County Council 
Election where both of these organisations put up candidates, and only 
against ‘Progressives’; 526 the result was: 1,300 votes in all out of 486,000, 
and the election of 4 Moderates (Conservatives) for seats held formerly by 
Progressives, and the cry of triumph in both Justicea and Labour Leaderb that 
they had beaten the Progressives. Imag ine the Paris Socialists voting with 
Clericals, Monarchists and Opportunists 87 against the parties claiming 
municipal autonomy for Paris, and you have the exact counterpart of the 
Socialist vote in London. But—to support the Progressives would have been 
to acknowledge that John Burns had be haved well in the County Council, and 
to endorse the policy of Sidney Webb and the Fabians 43 who, muffs though 
they be as Socialists, are really doing very good work municipally, and 
fighting energetically and cleverly for an autonomous London. And so the 
‘Socialists’ prefer to support the party which refuses to allow London its self-
government and fights hard to keep the County Council powerless. Now the 
County Council is the next and best  and easiest-to-be -conquered piece of 
governmental machinery—the working class could have it tomorrow if they 
were united. And what would Parliament be with a Socialist autonomous 
Council for London! 
The Berlin people are republishing Mohr’s articles in the Revue der Neuen 
Rheinischen Zeitung on France 1848-50 and I have written an introduction 
which will probably first appear in the Neue Zeit. It has suffered somewhat 
from the, as I think, exaggerated desires of our Berlin friends not to say 
anything which might be used as a means to assist in the passing of the 
Umsturzvorlage in the Reichstag. 428 Under the circumstances I had to give 
way. 529 But this Umsturzvorlage and the absolutely uncertain state of things 
in Germany—splendid though it be for the general progress of our party—
upsets a good deal of my calculations . I was, I believe you know, getting 
ready the Lassalle correspondence; 284 for that I have to compare a lot of old 
papers, letters, etc. But if the new bill passes, neither the letters nor my notes 
and introduction will be printable in Germany. And a reprint of our old 
articles of 1843-52 will be equally impossi ble. So I am compelled to neglect 
all this until we can see somewhat clearer wie

Things in Germany are decidedly beco ming critical. The latest escapade of 
young Williamb—his tiefste Entrüstung at the Reichstag’s anti-Bismarck 
vote 564 is big with serious eventualities. First as a symptom; it shows that he 
has now not only ‘a slate off but that the whole of his slate roof is getting out 
of order. Then as a défi.d I have no doubt our party will reply to that in the 
Reichstag, and although the thing may appear to be buried for the moment, 
the conflict is there and will crop up again. There is no doubt, we are facing 
in Germany a modern Charles I, a man possessed by Cäsarenwahnsinn.e 
Then look at the confusion the fellow creates in the ranks of the bourgeois 
parties. The Conservative Junker he in turns cajoles and repels; their clamour 
for state-secured rents he cannot satisfy; the alliance between landed 
aristocracy and large manufacturers, founded by Bismarck [in] 1878 by 
means of his protective tariff, 565 has gone to pot over conflicting economic 
interests; the Catholic party, 566 who hold the balance of power in the 
Reichstag with their 100 members, was on the best way of being bribed into 
voting for the Umsturzvorlage, when the Bismarck vote and the 
Entrüstunskaiserf throw them at once back in to opposition—and that means 
furthering the splitting up of the Catholic Centre into an aristocratic-
bourgeois wing and a democratic, peasant and working men’s wing. 
Everywhere confusion a nd disunion, pushing William to a coup d’ état to 
assert his divine right to  absolute power and to ge t rid of universal suffrage, 
and on the other side the silent and resistless advance of our party 
manifesting itself at every election fo r any post accessible to working men’s 
votes. This does look critical— qui vivra verrag! 
In a day or two I shall write to Paul about his half of his double-bedded 
book.h He has got a strange bed-fellow! 567 
Ever yours

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 568 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 1 April 1895 
 
Dear Baron, 
Postcard received. I was amazed to see today in the Vorwärts an excerpt 
from my ‘Introduction’ that had been printed without my prior knowledge 
and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of 
legality quand même .a 569 Which is all the more reason why I should like it to 
appear in its entirety in the Neue Zeit in order that this disgraceful impression 
may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it 
and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave 
him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what’s more, without so 
much as a word to me about it. 
Platter received with thanks. 541 Of very minor importance, though the 
man is coming increasingly into line. If things go on like this, we soon shan’t 
be able to stir for all these professors. It is absolutely capital that J. Wolf 
should also have replied. 570 I shall lay him alongside the others, together 
with Stiebeling and Loria. Sic transit gloria mundi.b 
Kindest regards from one household to the other. 
Yours

Dear Comrade, 
I have been compelled to decline, at  least for this year, all demands for 
contributions to extra numbers of periodicals both for 18 March and 1st May, 
and am therefore unable to make an exception in the shape of an 
‘winterview’ for Justice. This, however, does not mean that I should not be 
quite willing, if you should wish  it, to discuss with you  privately and in a 
friendly way the progress and the present position of the movement, in 
England and out of England. 
If this should meet your views a nd you will be good enough to propose a 
day and hour when you could call, I w ill try to arrange to be at home.

the History of Socialism by Kautsky, 561 various Italian reviews concern-

ing Loria (from Labriola) and a heap of Russian journals (from Nikolai 
Danielson). I am overwhelmed with post. Well, I read yours to the end 
nevertheless. It has a brilliant style, some very striking flashes of historical 
insight, there is truth in it and originality and, what is more important, it is 
not like the German professor’s book where what was true was not original 
and what was original was not true. Its principal fault is that apparently you 
were in too great a hurry to be done w ith it; the arrangement, in particular of 
the sections on feudal and capitalist prope rty, could have been more careful, 
especially for a Paris public, accustom ed to easy reading and, moreover, 
adapted for lazy readers; the Parisian , too, asserts his right to be lazy. 573 
Many very good passages may possibly lose some of their effect b ecause they 
are written as though in parentheses, or because you have left the trouble of 
drawing conclusions and results too much to the reader. 
As for the material itself, the main point of criticism is in the chapter on 
tribal communism. 574 There you lay too much emphasis, I think, on the form 
in which that phase has been maintained up to our own times, in France, and 
on the form of its dissolution in that country. The form of coparcenary under 
which the consanguineous community has gone on so long in France is 
already in itself a subdivision of the large family community, continued to 
our day in the zádruga of the Serbians and Bulgarians. This form, it appears 
certain, preceded the peasant commune in Russia, in Germany, etc.; in 
breaking up, the Slav zádruga, the German Hausgenossenschaft (genealogy 
of lex Alamannorum 575 ) passed over to the commune of separate families 
(or, quite often at first, and still toda y in Russia, to coparcenaries), with 
separately cultivated fields though subject to periodic redistribution —that is 
to say, what emerged from it was the Russian mira and the German 
Markgenossenschaft. The more restricted community of several families 
which was kept up in France was no more, as I see it, than an integral part of 
the Markgenossenschaft, at any rate in the North (the Frankish region); in the 
South (former Aquitaine) it may perhaps have formed a unity holding its land 
under the superior ownership of the lord of the manor alone, without being 
subject to the control of the village commune. It is only this special French 
form which, on breaking up, could pass in one leap to the individual 
ownership of the land.b 
This is a point on which there are still many things to study. It is from

you that I learn of this special charact er of tribal communism in France, and 
since you are already in it heart and soul, you could not do better than to 
pursue this study, which holds out great promise.* 
Small errata: 
p. 338, you make the water of the Peruvian aqueducts  flow upwards; as 
there is scarcely any natural water in Peru save in ‘the heart of the moun-
tains’, and as your aqueducts are expressly built to carry water to them, it 
must, I suppose, be sea-water? 
p. 354. Terra salica.a Guérard is making a huge mistake with his derivation 
of Sala house.b So the Salian Franks were Franks living in houses? They 
were called Salians, Salio, after the small region of Holland, Salland, where 
the group which conquered Belgium and France between Ardennes and Loire 
was formed for the conquest; the name still exists today. At the time when 
the Salic Law was drafted (about 400), 576 the Sala was still, as you have 
observed yourself, a personal estate among the Germans. 
p. 386 ‘another likes to set the snares or prepare grass-hoppers [saute-
relles]. Did they eat grasshoppers in Berry in 1787? I look in my dictionary 
and I find saute rolle , bird-trap. 
p. 393. Black redistribution—in Russia tchornoi,c black, is used for dirty, 
and in a secondary sense popular, common, vulgar. Tchornoi narod,c the 
black people—the common people, the people as a whole. Tchornoi 
perediel,c black redistribution, means rather therefore the general, universal 
distribution, where everyone has his share, including the poorest. And in this 
sense a Narodnik (friend of the peasants) journal in Switzerland was called 
Tchornoi perediel,c which was meant to signify the distribution of 
aristocratic estates amongst the peasants. 
That is all that I have noted and you will have had enough. As for Yves 
Guyot, I wash my hands of it.

serve his purpose in support of peaceful  and anti-violent tactics at any

price, which he has chosen to preach fo r some time now, particularly at this 
juncture when coercive laws are being drawn up in Berlin. 428 But I preach 
those-tactics only for the Germany of today and even then with many 
reservations. For France, Belgium, Italy, Aust ria, such tactics could not be 
followed as a whole and, for Germany,  they could become inapplicable 
tomorrow. So please wait for the comp lete article before judging it—it will 
probably appear in Neue Zeit, and I expect copies of the pamphlet any day 
now. It’s a pity that Liebknecht can see only black and white. Shades don’t 
exist for him. 
However, things are warming up in Germany, it promises a splendid end 
to the century. Young William’sa ‘indignation’ 564 is highly amusing. You 
may be sure our people will answer him in the Reichstag where there is no 
lese-majesty.

advice straight away as to the extent to which the copyright owned by Marx’s 
heirs still applies to his articles in the ‘Rheinische Zeitung of 1842. The ar-
ticles appeared anonymously. As anonymous articles, however, they are of 
no value to Mr Baake. So far as he is concerned they only acquire value 
through Marx’s name. And if he publishes them under Marx’s name, is he 
not thereby acknowledging that we have the copyright in so far as this might 
perhaps have been compromised by the fact of their having first appeared 
anonymously? 
If there is no recourse to law—which w ould first have to be established so 
that we can act accordingly—it would be be st if you were to get copies made 
of all the articles—three—in the library and send me duplicates, so that I 
could look through them quickly and write an introduction. There are three 
articles. 
1. On the proceedings of the Rhine Province Assembly, 
2. On thefts of wood, 
3. On the condition of the wine growers on the Mosel. 578 
You would then have to issue an announcement straight away to the effect 
that they would be brought out by you and edited by me, along with an 
introduction and notes (if any). 
So far as the Russians are concerned,  it is normal practice to encroach 
upon an author’s rights without so much as your leave ‘in the interests of 
propaganda’, not to speak of the interests, as is frequently the case, of their 
own private printing-shop and publishing house, as opposed to those of 
others. 579 Up till now, however, I have not b een accustomed to that kind of 
thing when dealing with Germans. 
Had I only known what I had merely suspected, namely that the old 
Rheinische Zeitung is in the Berlin Library, I should have gone there back in 
1893 580 and looked it out, in which case we should have made a good deal 
more progress in regard to other matters too. 
Is Baake a brother of Kurt Baake’s? 
Regards to everyone. 
Yours,

IN ZURICH 
London, 6 April 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
Dear Schmidt, 
I am most indebted to you for your tenacity over the ‘fiction’.a (There is in 
fact a difficulty here which I only mast ered as a result of your insistence 
upon the ‘fiction’. The solution may be found in II I, 1, pp. 154-157b though 
it has not been elaborated or emphasi sed with sufficient exactitude, a cir-
cumstance that has persuaded me to enlarge briefly on the above point in the 
Neue Zeit with reference to Sombart’sc and your objections. In any case there 
is a further point regard ing which I should like to make an addition to 
Volume II I and bring it into line with the situation today by taking account 
of certain changes in economic conditions since 1865. 534 
But if I am to develop that point concerning the effectiveness and validity 
of the law of value, it would make thing easier for me if you would permit 
me to make mention, not only of the ‘hypothesis’ of your Centralblatt 
article,d but also of the ‘fiction’ you discuss in your two letters and to quote 
one or two passages from them for the purpose of defining more precisely 
what you mean by the hypothesis of the article. So would you kindly reread 
the passage alluded to above and then tell me whether I may say that the 
aforesaid quotations were extracted from letters by Dr C. Schmidt to myself. 
Should you be convinced by Marx’ passage that, where the production of 
commodities is concerned, the law of value is, after all, rather more than a 
necessary fiction, we should then see eye to eye, and in that case I should of 
course be glad to dispense with this. 
Mrs Freyberger, formerly Louise Ka utsky I, along with her little girl, 
sends you her best compliments in the same way as I would ask you to 
remember me very kindly to your wife.

Baudeau, no one understood this impor tant piece of work on political

from the obscurity whither they had been consigned by the subsequent 
successes of the English school. Should it be granted me to edit Book IV of

Dear Hermann, 
I have heard nothing further about the sherry since it was despatched.a All 
I know is that immediately after the hard weather the two Cologne steamers 
Energie and Industrie were reported as having a rrived here—departures are 
difficult to keep track of in the newspapers and I don’t therefore know 
whether both have sailed—and if so when. If the wine doesn’t turn up in the 
course of next week, please send me a postcard and I shall then make 
inquiries. 
The news that the wedding had gone off so merrily and that the loving 
coupleb had enjoyed their honeymoon pleased me enormously. It is all right 
about the 80 marks. I hope that by now you have quite shaken off your 
influenza. Luckily I have recovered from mine and am gradually beginning 
to get out and about again. 
Very many thanks for the informati on re the Schaaffhausens. I shall be 
glad to take up the allotment of 1000 marks— à 120%. The initial payment of 
700 marks will be amply covered by my balance as at 30.4.94, even after 
deduction of the £40 (...)c per P.P. & Co., while accrued interest and the last 
Schaaffhausen dividend ought to be just about enough for the remaining 
payment of 500 marks. Should a few more marks be needed, you might be so 
good as to advance them to me pending the next dividend—i.e. assuming 
that I have not overlooked anything in the above calculation, in which case 
kindly advise me. 
The conversion into bonds à 1,000 marks would also be perfectly ac-
ceptable to me if it could be done without leaving a tiresome or unproductive 
balance, something that can’t be managed just now when all bonds must be 
in denominations of 1,000 or 450. So if the thing is impossible it

Well, you now have the prompt answer you wanted. For the past four days 
we have been having wonderful spring weather; overnight everything began 
sprouting and burgeoning and the warm sun in the day time is quite untypical 
of a normal English April with its grey skies and biting north-easters. 
For the first time in my life I paid a dentist 10/6d last Mondaya for pulling 
out a couple of old stumps. Now I only have seventeen teeth left, all of them 
in front and all of them so far complete, but nothing at the back, so I may 
have to be fitted with a set of false teeth!

Dear Fischer, 
The 400 marks received with thanks. I shall change them tomorrow and 
distribute them to the heirs. 583 
So the position as regards the essays in the old Rheinische Zeitung is as I 
feared.a The copyright has lapsed and only by acting swiftly can we restore 
our title to it. It will therefore be pe rfectly in order if you at once announce 
that the articles will be published by you and edited and annotated by me. 
Possibly under the title: 
Karl Marx’s Early Writings. Three E ssays from the (First) ‘Rheinische 
Zeitung’ of 1842. I. The Rhine Province Assembly on Freedom of the Press. II . 
The Same on the Law relating to Thefts of Wood. II I. The Condition of the 
Wine-Growers on the Mosel. Edited and with an Introduction by F. Engels. 578 
a See this volume, pp. 490-91  
=====第523页=====
Letters- 1895 497 
I am not quite happy about the title and should like you if possible to 
refrain from giving it a definite title un til we have found one that is more 
suitable. As to the Mosel article, 584 I am sure of the facts in as much as Marx 
always used to tell me that it was precisely his preoccupation with the law on 
thefts of wood and the condition of th e Mosel wine-growers that led him 
from politics pure and simple to economic conditions and thus to socialism. 
And during our conversations we always treated the Mosel article as having 
emanated from him. I didn’t read it, as I was already in England at the time. 
It is so long ago since we spoke of the matter that I cannot entirely rule out 
the eventuality of a misunderstanding. On ce I have the article in front of me, 
I cannot possibly go wrong. 
Now as to your great scheme, 585 I think you would do best to shelve it 
until the fate of the Subversion Bill 428 has been decided. A library which re-
issues historical documents and writings from earlier periods cannot tolerate 
any kind of censorship—quite literally or not at all. Still less could I consent 
to Marx’s and my own early works being subjected to a process of 
emasculation, however wild, in order to conform to the conditions 
temporarily obtaining in the press. But in view of the fact that we used to 
write in a very unrestrained way and were  forever justifying things which, in 
the territories of the German Empire, ar e regarded either as a crime or an 
offence, a re-issue in Berlin after the passing of that exemplary Bill would be 
quite impossible without numerous deletions. 
Secondly, however, I have a scheme for again presenting Marx’s and my 
lesser writings to the public in a complete edition —not, that is to say, by 
instalments but all at one go, in whole volumes. I have already been in 
correspondence with Augusta on the subject and we are still discussing it. So 
you might have a word with him when he gets back. I am by no means 
certain that an enterprise like this is really your cup of tea, nor do I know 
whether you, i.e. the publishing side of the Vorwärts, are the best people for 
the job—quite aside from the harassmen t of the press which has already 
inclined me to believe that we may be forced to have recourse to a publisher 
outside the German Empire. 
Marx would never have consented to the issue of a work by instalments. In 
the case of the 2nd Ed. of Capital I he once allowed Meissner to bring out 
seven big instalments, each of some seven sheet s, but that was as much as he 
could stomach. 586 To chop up books such as The Holy Family, Herr  
a Bebel

Vogt, etc., into instalments of two sheets or so would certainly not do. In 
such cases people derive absolutely nothing from their reading and to read a 
work in this way, piecemeal, is conducive only to incomprehension. 
The Tribune articles exist only in English. 587 
We survived the holiday without too many mishaps and the weather was 
really beautiful. Otherwise no news. As soon as you have a copy of one of 
the three articles from the Rheinische Zeitung, please send it to me straight 
away so that I can set to work. By registered book post or, if not, in some 
other manner with adequate re gard for safety precautions. 
Many regards to everyone.

I have at last succeeded in hunting up the old Rheinische Zeitung of 1842. 
It was all this time in the Berlin Bibliothek, and our friends in Berlin, who 
might have known that long ago, only found it out now. Someone in Berlina 
had a sharper way of doing things than they, and intended publishing Mohrs 
articles therefrom; 578 we have no right to stop th is, as according to German 
law all anonymous or pseudonymous works become public property after 30 
years from date of publication, unless copyright has been previously 
registered by the author or other qui de droit.b However this threatened 
competition roused our friends all at once; Fischer who manages now the 
publishing department of the Vorwärts book-selling firm, has at once, at my 
suggestion,c set some one to copy Mohrs chief articles, and will announce 
that I am going to edit them with in troduction, etc. This will probably stop 
competition. Financially we can hardly expect much, if anything, therefrom, 
but at all events the articles are safe. 
For the Lassalle letters 284 and ulterior plans of republication of old affairs, 
we shall have to await the fate of the Coercion Bill 428 before the Reichstag; 
if that passes, I do not see how we can safely proceed to work, at least in 
Berlin. Maybe Stuttgart may remain more favourable—anyhow qui vivra 
verra.d 
I hope you send the Devenir social also to Madrid—our friends there are 
almost entirely dependent, for foreign reading, on French literature, and it 
strikes me they get to see more from other sects’ publications than from ours. 
For if the management of the Socialiste is to serve as a pattern, woe be unto 
us! The Vorwärts announces the complete reorga nisation of that illustrious 
paper, published ‘mit Ausschluss der Oeffentlichkeit’,e and that Chauvin has 
remodelled the publishing department 588—if so, il est tellement chauvinf that 
nobody here has seen a trace of it. But then, the Vorwärts seems to know of 
France only the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, and if the nouvelles ne sont pas 
assez bonnes, il les fabrique lui-même.g 
Many thanks for your news about Sganarelle, they are quite sufficient for 
the éclairage de ma têteh upon the subject. 589 
I had in my head only the Sganarelle of the Médecin volant and Don Juan.

Dear Kugelmann, 
I apologise for having overlooked your request that I should at once write 
to you about Livingston, though his letter as such hardly seemed to call for 
any special reply. 559 I don’t imagine that Jacobi or M. Becker will have 
anything useful. If Livingston writes to them, we shall find that out. We have 
been regularly corresponding with Sorge for many many years. 
Apart from that I am most grateful to you for your information. I, too, am 
at a loss to know how to trace an ything that may have appeared 
anonymously in the Westphälisches Dampfboot. 558 It is possible that when I 
get down to work one thing or another will refresh my memory. Besides, 
should there be anything in it, it would be of little consequence and serve at 
most as proof of our lack of agr eement with the Biel efeld sentimental 
socialism of the day. 590 
Lastly, I shall doubtless have to do as you say. 591I, too, having long been 
of the opinion that this was how we should proceed if the worst came to

the worst. Meanwhile one thing and anot her continues to turn up as, recently, 
the old Rheinische Zeitung in the Berlin Library. What might badly upset our 
calculations, however, is the Subversion Bill. 428 Until that has been decided 
there can be no thought of devising a plan of action. Many regards from the 
Freybergers and myself to you and yours.

Dear Fischer, 
One further matter: Would you please take another look at the old 
Rheinische Zeitung with regard to the Mosel articles 584 to find out whether 
some sort of polemic may not have arisen over the things and if so whether 
there are also articles under Marx’s usual pseudonym and written in his own 
style—short, antithetically expressed sentences—as well as any other shorter 
articles under the same pseudonym and stylistically the same. If there are, let 
me know. 
I can no longer remember my own articles—the best of them fell foul of 
the censor—or even my pseudonym; most of the longer ones, i.e. those that 
are not merely day to day reports, are in the supplement or the feuilleton. 
In addition to the articles in the Rheinische Zeitung, 578 I have discovered 
=====第528页=====
502 Letters- 1895 
another one by Marx dating from the same period and also dealing with the 
machinations of the censor.a This can be printed with the remainder but no 
one must get wind of it since it, too, appeared anonymously. It will run to 
between 11/2 and 2 sheets. I may possibly discover some other shorter 
pieces, in which case we shall have coll ected all the main items from Marx’s 
pre-socialist period. Meanwhile see to it that a copy is sent off to me quickly 
and we can then agree upon our next move.

IN BERLIN 
London, [End of April 1895]  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. 
 
Dear Mr Mehring, 
May I say how very grateful I am for your offer, which is gladly accepted, 
to help me hunt out Marx’s early writings for republication. The first 
difficulty to confront me was the Rheinische Zeitung of 1842, which I had 
imagined to be in the Berlin Library. Despite numerous inquiries, I was 
unable to ascertain whether it was actually there, but now that that point has 
been cleared up, we can make a start. 
Marx was in Bonn up till October 1842. When I passed through at the end 
of September or the beginning of October on my return from Berlin, the 
editorial board consisted, so far as I recall, only of M. Hess and Dr Rave, a 
former editor of the Elberfelder Zeitung (which was, I believe, known by 
another name at the time). Rutenberg had, I believe, already been expelled, 
though I am not sure about that. When I dropped in again towards the end of 
November on my way to England, I ran into Marx there and that was the 
occasion of our first, distinctly chilly  meeting. Marx had meanwhile taken a 
stand against the Bauers, i.e. he had said he was opposed not only to the 
Rheinische Zeitung becoming predominantly a vehicle for theological 
propaganda, atheism, etc., rather than for political discussion and action, but 
also to Edgar Bauer’s hot air brand of communism, which was based on a 
sheer love of ‘going to extremes’ and was soon after replaced by Edgar with 
other kinds of extremist hot air. Since I corresponded with the Bauers, I was 
regarded as their ally, whereas they cau sed me to view Marx with suspicion. 
To the best of my recollection Marx  resigned—at any rate officially—
from the post of editor en chef on I January 1843. That, however, did not 
prevent him from surreptitiously contributing to the paper up to and 
including February. I think I am equally right in saying that the ukase 
requiring the paper to close down on 31 March 1843 was served on it no later 
than 31 December. Negotiations then began, the result of 
=====第530页=====
504 Letters- 1895 
which proved negative, hence the delay in publishing the ukase until 28 
January and likewise in appointing the chief censor who had, in fact, already 
been functioning for some time. At one period there were no less than three 
censors: 1. the usual censor, 2. assessor von Saint-Paul who had been sent 
from Berlin, 3. the District President. Saint-Paul was still there at the time of 
the paper’s funeral feast. The vacillations between 12 and 18 February would 
pretty well coincide with Marx’s departure from Cologne. 593 
If, by comparing these data with the paper itself, you could discover more 
details or rectify inaccuracies, it would be  of great benefit both to your work 
and to mine. 
As regards the Mosel articles, 584 it will doubtless turn out to be as you 
say. Marx was tied to Cologne at the time and could not possibly have 
collected material of that kind in person. 
The article I mentioned to Fischer 1 is in fact the one about the censorship 
instruction which appeared in Ruge’s Anekdota.b 
One of the best pieces in the Rheinische Zeitung, again in the feuilleton, is 
a long critique of Leo’s History of the French Revolution. It is my Marx’s 
friend C. F. Köppenc (who also wrote about old Fritzd and Norse 
mythologye) and (for the first time in any language) gives a correct expla-
nation for the reign of terror. 
Certain quotations and retrospective insights in your articles in the Neue 
Zeit have already shown me that you have made a thorough study of the 
period previous to 1848. 1 am glad that it has fallen to you to deal with this, 
as well as with the later period in respect of Germany. 
There might possibly be one or two more things of Marx’s in the sup-
plement for the period prior to October 1842; it would hardly be worth your 
while to search out smaller items from Bonn in the main part of the paper. 
My heartfelt condolences on the destruction of the Freie Volksbühne. 
594Subversion from above coul d not possibly have passe d that institution by. 
Once again my best thanks. 
Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Mehring, 
Very many thanks for your long and informative letter plus enclosures, 
which I shall reply to at length as soon as my cranium permits. Unfortunately 
for the past week a rheumatic condition of the scalp has been encircling and 
compressing it as though with a band of iron. I hope to have got over it by 
next week along with the attendant insomnia. Meanwhile I agree to your 
proposal that the only articles from the Rheinische Zeitung that should be 
published in their entirety are the two long ones and those on Communisma 
(as also the article from the Anekdotab). It would only be necessary to copy 
from the remainder such passages as you might be so good as to indicate as 
being the most pregnant (along with particulars of the context). As regards 
the Mosel articles, 584 it would be desirable if my introduction included a 
brief outline both of the course of the debate and of the contents. 
Would you be kind enough to acquaint Fischer with the foregoing? Once again my 
best thanks and until my next, which has to do with one minor detail, 
I remain  
Yours sincerely

At the moment I feel so run down as a result of rheumatic pains in the 
scalp and the insomnia associated ther ewith that I am incapable of any kind 
of work. I hope to be all right again by next week. In the meantime, however, 
seeing that you and Mehring can both take a look at the copy of the 
Rheinische Zeitung, I think it would be best if y ou yourselves were to arrange 
what should be done with the shorter and Mosel 584 articles and to provide me 
with a copy just of the most important bits. I am also sending Mehring a line 
or two about it.a

London, 14 May 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W. 
 
My dear Löhr 
I was extremely glad, and indeed so were Louise and Ludwig to learn that 
both you and Paul were ready and willing to come over here for a bit, and I 
should have written at once in reply,  had it not been for those confounded 
pains which for a week nearly drove me mad and even now have not left me, 
anything but painless, but extremely stupid and unfit for anything. The fact is 
this. Some time ago I got a swelling on the right side of the neck, which after 
some time resolved itself into a bunch of  deep-seated glands infiltrated by 
some cause or other. The pains arose from direct pressure of that lump on the 
nerve and will of course only give way when that pressure disappears. At 
present a process of resorption is going on very satisfactorily, but a couple of 
these glands are suppurating and will have to be cut; and as they are so deep-
seated and slow in coming to the surf ace, and we old peopl e being such slow 
coaches, the time for the operation cannot be exactly fixed, but it is hoped 
will come off this week. That once performed I am ordered to the sea-side; 
but the uncertainty is still about the time. 
Now as things are situated, would it not be the best thing for you to come 
over say in the course of next week, and then as soon as possible you and I 
could bundle off to Eastbourne 596 and settle down in comfortable quarters 
and prepare for visitors from London. I say you and I, because I intend to 
keep you here a good bit longer than very likely Paul would care to separate 
himself from his studies and your animals and the garden work; so he 
perhaps would prefer to do as you say and come tumbling after. 
When I shall have cleared out from here, Louise intends giving my two 
rooms a good cleaning down and after that she might come and join us with 
her baby for a week or so; after that Tussy and Edward might come, and then 
Paul who by that time is sure to be tired of his solitude, and then

we might bethink ourselves of returni ng all of us to London and show Paul 
our new establishment too. 
This is such a sort of rough prospectus as a man with neuralgic pains in 
the head after a series of sleepless nights has been able to excogitate under 
the present indefinite conditions, and th erefore subject to alterations as novel 
circumstances and novel ideas may comma nd. It is humbly submitted to you 
for approval or improvement as may be. 
The heat is insupportable, 22°C in the room all day long—no wind, clouds 
and impending thunder which unfortunately keeps impending. And that 2 
months after that hard frost! 
Kind regards from the Freybergers to both of you. Amitiés à Paul et au 
revoir.

Dear (...)a 
You have set us a difficult task. We are to seek out ‘the journalist Tollittb 
England’ as also those ‘English papers ’ containing the relevant details about 
Brauweiler. 598 In the first place, the English daily press does not even 
mention the name Braunweiler in its accounts of the case. The report of a 
Parliamentary Committee is not, however, published until its work has been 
completed. So the item must doubtless have emanated from some obscure 
trade paper and will therefore be impossi ble to trace in this country. In the 
second place, no one here knows the journalist Tollitt, who according to 
some is called Pollitt. Dr Freyberger tried in vain to track him down at the 
NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB which has a vast number of journalists 
amongst its members. We have now taken further steps in order to discover 
the man if possible—it seems quite clear that he does not live in London or 
work for the political press; more likely he is in some trade branch—though 
that will take time. But it is very naive of you to expect that he would appear 
over there as witness on your behalf. After all, he himself says that he got 
into the prisons by stealth, and conseque ntly be would at once be thrown into 
jug in Cologne for bribery of officials or something of the kind, and put on 
trial. Hofrichter’s

suggestion that he should submit to a judicial examination here is also 
impracticable. If, however, he is willing, he can swear an affidavit (a state-
ment made on oath which, if false, carries with it all the consequences 
arising from perjury) before a Justice of the Peace in which he attests the 
statements he made before the co mmittee. Once the document had been 
ratified by the German Consul, it would also be legally valid over there. 
Bernstein was away from London during that week and Beer has no 
connections whatever in the circ les in which Tollitt must be sought. 
As soon as we discover anything further we shall let you know.a But time 
is damned short. Where did you get the item from ? Keep on inquiring over 
there until you have found out how and through whom it got into the German 
press. That would provide a clue. 
Many regards.

History of Socialism. 561 Of all the people then living there was only one, I 
think I may say, whose collaboration was absolutely necessary, and that 
person was myself. I might even say that, without my help, a work of this 
nature cannot today be anything but inco mplete and inadequate. And this you 
knew as well as I did. But of all those who might have been of use to you, I 
and I alone was the only one who was not invited to collaborate. So you must 
have had very pertinent reasons fo r choosing to exclude me. I am not 
complaining—far from it. You had a perfect right to act as you did. I merely 
remark on the fact. 
What did pique me, however, if only for a moment, was the strange se-
cretiveness with which you withheld from me a matter about which all the 
rest of the world was talking. It was only from third persons that I learned of 
the whole enterprise, and it was only from the printed prospectus that I 
learned of the general outline of the scheme, Not a word either from you or 
from Ede; it was as though you had a guilty  conscience. At the same time all 
manner of people kept surreptitiously inquiring what conn ection I had with 
the thing, whether I had refused to collaborate, etc. And then at length, when 
silence could no longer be maintained, the good Ede got round to mentioning 
the subject with a sheepishness and embarrassment that would have been 
worthy of a worse cause—though nothing wrong had been done save for this 
absurd play-acting which, in the m eantime, as Louise can testify, has 
enlivened many a dull hour for me. 
Well and good. You have presented me with a fait accompli; a History of 
Socialism on which I have not collaborated. I have accepted the fact without 
complaint from the very start. But that fact is of your own making, nor can 
you do away with or ignore it, should this ever happen to suit your purpose. 
And neither can I do away with it. If, on mature reflection, you chose to slam 
the front door in my face at a time when  my advice and help might have been 
of material use to you, please do not expect of me that I should now slink in 
through some little back door in order to  help you out of a quandary. I must 
admit that, had the roles been reversed, I should have reflected for a very, 
very long time before coming to you with a request such as this one. 600 Is it 
really so terribly difficult to see that ev eryone must bear the consequences of 
his own actions? As YOU MADE YOUR BED so YOU MUST LIE IN IT . If there is 
no room for me here, it is only because you wanted it so. 
Well, that settles that. And now you would oblige me by considering this 
reply as irrevocable. Let us both regard the whole incident as finished 
=====第538页=====

and done with. 601 Nor shall I mention it to Ede again unless he is the first to 
broach it. 
Meanwhile I am engaged in producing another piece for the Neue Zeit 
which should gladden your heart— Ergänzungen und Nachtäge zum 
‘Kapital’, Buch II I, No. 1: Law of Value and Rate of  Profit. Reply to the 
Objections of Sombart and C. Schmidt. No. 2—the role of the Stock 
Exchange which has changed very considerably since Marx wrote about it in 
1865—will follow later. 534 A sequel will follow if required and should time 
permit. The first article would have been finished had I had nothing else on 
my mind. 
Of your book,a I can say that it improves the further into it one gets. To 
judge by the original plan, your treatme nt of Plato and early Christianity still 
leaves something to be desired. You do very much better on the medieval 
sects, after which you go from strength to strength; and are at your beat on 
the Taborites, 563 Münzer and then the Anabaptists. 562 Alongside a great 
many more important economic analyses  of political events  there are also 
some commonplaces which would seem to  indicate a gap in your studies. I 
have learnt a great deal from your book which is indispensible preliminary 
reading for my new edition of The Peasant War. 235 It would seem to me to 
have two main faults—1. Very inadequate research into the development and 
role of the déclassé, almost pariah- like elements who had no place whatever 
in the feudal system and who were the inevitable outcome of urban 
development,, It is they who in all cases formed the lowest stratum of urban 
population in the Middle Ag es—devoid of rights and set apart from village 
communities, craft guilds and feudal dependence. Though difficult, this 
should serve as your main basis, for by degrees, with the dissolution of the 
feudal bonds, these elements became the pre-proletariat which, in 1789, was 
responsible for the revolution in the faubourgs’ 3 of Paris and absorbed all the 
outcasts of feudal and guild society. You talk of proletarians—a term which 
is inapt—amongst whom you comprise weavers whose importance you quite 
rightly stress—but you can count them among your ‘proletariat’ only after, 
and in so far as, déclassé journeymen weavers cam e into existence outside of 
the guilds. There is still much room for improvement here. 
2. You have not fully grasped the position of Germany—her international 
economic position in so far as it is  possible to speak of any such 
a Kautsky, Von Plato bis zu den Wiedertäufern —b suburbs  
=====第539页=====

thing—in the world market at the end of the fifteenth century. That position 
alone explains why the bourgeois-plebeian movement, disguised as religion, 
which failed in England, the Netherlands and Bohemia should, in sixteenth 
century Germany, have enjoyed a certain success—the success of its 
religious trappings —whereas the success of its bourgeois substance was 
reserved for the next century and fo r the countries, Holland and England, 
which had meanwhile evinced a new tendency in international trade. It is a 
lengthy subject which I hope to deal with in extenso in The Peasant War —
would I had got to that stage! 
In an attempt to remain popular your style is now that of the leader writer, 
now that of the dominie. This you should be able to avoid. Again, is it for 
Janssen’s sake that you still refuse to  see the pun in which Ulrich von Hütten 
is indulging with his obscuri viri? The joke lies in the fact of its meaning 
both—obscure or obscurantist—and that is what Hutten was trying to say. 602 
But that is all by the way. You and Ede have both been working on a 
completely new subject, and you cannot expect to attain perfection straight 
away. You should be glad to have produced a book that is presentable, even 
at this stages when it is, as it were, in its initial draft form. Now, however, 
you are both honour-bound not to allow the ground you have broken to lie 
fallow but to continue with your researches so that, in a few years’ time, you 
will be able to bring out a new edition capable of meeting every requirement. 
Someone in St Petersburg has sent me a Russian translation of your old

One more thing. I have suggested to Sorge that, when he has finished his 
articles on the American movement, these should be published as an off-
print. 603 He is agreeable but says there will have to be a great deal of revision 
and many corrections and additions, for which he is unlikely

to have time until his summer holidays.  He accepted my proposal that the 
thing be suggested to Dietz. Perhaps you would be so good as to ask Dietz if 
he would care to take it on and, if so, on what terms. The articles are the 
best, and the only authentic, stuff we have got on the American movement, 
and I think it most desirable that they should be preserved for readers as a 
consecutive whole in an off-print.

IN COLOGNE 
London, 22 May 1895  
41 Regent’s Park Road, N. W.  
Dear Editors, 
The man has been found, is called Ja mes Pollitt, and is ready to do any-
thing within reason. Has already supplied us with all the material to be had. 
The articles are in The Hardwareman, 11 and 18 May—stenographic reports 
of the sessions of the BOARD OF  TRADE COMMITTEE on convict labour 
abroad, at which his statements were made. These are being sent to you in 
the original with translations of the passages relating to Braunweiler. He will 
further supply us with samples of th e commodities produced in Braunweiler 
and sold over here, and also an affi davit as to the accuracy both of his 
statements before the Committee and of the excerpts quoted by you. 
But since the material is very ample and would not lend itself to being 
paraphrased in a letter in such a way as to put you in a position to make full 
use of it in court, a personal discussion is urgently called for. This morning I 
therefore telegraphed Hirsch, 37 Hämergasse, Cologne: ‘Most important that 
Hirsch, Hofrichter or lawyer co me over here forthwith Engels’. 133

It is to be hoped that someone has set off at once and will, on arrival, 
present himself at  
41 Regent’s Park Road, where he w ill find accommodation and thus be able 
to get down to work forthwith. The w hole thing should be settled in twelve 
hours, after which he could, if necessary, leave for home. 
I enclose a note of the expenses that ha ve arisen so far and shall later let 
you have a full account of them. 
The man who gets his London agent, S. A. Rothschild, to sell the 
Braunweiler products for him in this country is called Christian Abner and 
lives in Cologne. He would be your most important witness. He would have 
to be asked to declare on oath what commodities he obtains from 
Braunweiler and exports to England.  Pollitt followed the fully laden waggons 
from the institution in Braunweiler to  his place of business in Cologne. 
Abner has, in fact, had statements printed in English to the effect that he does 
not sell the products of convict labour, for he maintains that Braunweiler is 
not a prison but merely a house of correction. But such distinctions cut no ice 
over here. 
More tomorrow, if no one has turned up by then. 
Kindest regards from 
Yours,

IN LONDON 
Eastbourne, 596 18 June 1895 4 Royal Parade  
Dear Ede, 
Thank you for your letter—there is some improvement but, in accordance 
with the principles of dialectics, the positive and the negative aspects are 
both showing a cumulative tendency. I am stronger, eat more and with a 
better appetite and look very well, or so  I am told; thus my general condition 
has improved. On the other hand, the disease as such has also shown a 
cumulative tendency—more tumours and hence more pain and greater 
difficulty in getting to sleep, etc. The thing is taking a course that is normal, 
if more critical and not quite so sluggish as in London. Consequently my 
duly acquired pathological stupidity has tended to grow worse, as has my 
inability to work. Today I have had another particularly bad day but now, at 
5 p.m., my mind is just beginning to grow a little more lucid. 
Louise, Ludwig and their little girl came down on Saturday.a Ludwig has 
to be back on duty at his London hosp ital on Sunday but will probably return 
here on the Friday or Saturday. 
The Avelings are coming down on Saturday or Sunday and, perhaps, Sam 
Moore also. Unfortunately they will have to provide their own entertainment 
since, subjectively and objectively, I am a bore. 
Love to Gine and the children.b My visitors have all gone out and I have

[Draft] 
Eastbourne, 28 June 1895

Dear citizen Turati, 
To write a summary of the three volumes of Capital is one of the most 
=====第545页=====
Letters- 1895 519 
difficult tasks a writer could set himself. 609 In the whole of Europe there are, 
in my opinion, no more than half a dozen men capable of undertaking it. 
Among other prerequisites one must have a profound knowledge of 
bourgeois political economy, and also complete mastery of the German 
language. Now you say that your Labriolinoa is not very strong in the second, 
while his articles in Critica Socialeb prove to me that he would do better to 
begin by understanding the 1st volume before wishing to produce his own 
work on all three volumes. I do not have the legal right to prevent him from 
doing this, but I must wash my hands of the affair completely. 
As for the other Labriola,c the malicious tongue which you attribute to him 
may have a certain justification in a country such as Italy, where the socialist 
party, 340 like all the other parties, has been invaded, like a plague of locusts, 
by that ‘declassed bourgeois youth’, of which Bakunin was so proud. 
Result: rampant literary dilettantism which only too often lapses into 
sensationalism and is inevitably followed by a spirit of camaraderie domi-
nating the press. It is not our fault that this is the state of affairs, but you are 
subjected to this environment, as is everyone else. I would speak at greater 
length about Labriola but when I find that bits and pieces from my private 
letters have been reproduced in the Critica Sociale without my knowledge, 
610 you must agree that it is better if I remain silent. For the rest, after all the 
quarrels and controversies, the party w ould seem to have behaved in general 
at the last elections as the situation required: independent confirmation at the 
1st round when that did not help the Crispinis, support for the radicals and 
republicans at elections where our candidates had no chance of winning. 611 
Warmest greetings from Dr and Mme Aveling, who are here with me, and 
also from myself, to you and citizen Anna Kulishov. 
Yours,

To-morrow we return to London. There seems to be at last a crisis ap-

to a turning. And high time it is for with my deficient appetite, etc. I have

The elections here have come off as  I said: a large Tory majority, the 
Liberals hopelessly beaten and I hope in full dissolution. 345 The brag of 
Independent Labour Party 114 and Social Democratic Federation 44 face to 
face with a reality of some 82,000 votes for Labour Candidates up to now 
(hardly any yet to come) and the loss of K. Hardie’s seat. Still that was more 
than they had a right to expect. 
Victor Adler is here. Have you or Paul any questions to ask him about 
Paul’s arrangement with the Arbeiter-Zeitung or can I be of any use in any 
way to you with him?

Dear Sir, 
When, during your stay in Berlin, I had the honour of making your 
personal acquaintance at the Wallmüller Inn, I believe to have mentioned, in 
the course of our conversation about Schelling, a pamphlet on him written by 
me,a which was then being printed. I am taking leave to enclose a copy of this 
little work, just off the press, with the request of kindly contributing to its 
circulation by mentioning it in the Jahrbücher 622 When an occasion offers 
itself. I need hardly say that it is calculated for a public with roughly the 
educational level of a student. 
Perhaps I will take the liberty of soon sending you an article for the 
Jahrbücher which, without reference to an y particular recently published 
work, deals with the Christian poetry of the Middle Ages, notably with its 
central figure, Dante. This is done in the context of the perspectives opened 
up by Feuerbach. 623 Meanwhile I am sending you my regards and best 
wishes for the success of the Jahrbücher.  
Yours faithfully,

I met him and I am sorry to say that his report is anything but cheering; he 
says that the disease has attained such  a hold that, considering the General’s 
age, his state is precarious. Apart from th e diseased glands of the neck there 
is danger either from weakness of the heart or from pneumonia—and in 
either of these two cases the end would be sudden. He may go on for some 
weeks if pneumonia does not intervene, but if it does then it will be a 
question of a few hours. In spite of all, however, the General is quite hopeful 
and is certain that he will recover—he intends, and has arranged with the 2 
doctors, to return to London on Wednesday eveningb so that if you want to 
see him you had better go to 41 R.P.R. on Thursday. 
This is sad news and I trust the doctors may be mistaken. There is so much 
work to be done which the General alone is capable of doing, that his loss 
will be irreparable from a public point of view—to his friends it will be a 
calamity. 
I have just time to write this in haste. 
Yours very sincerely 
S. Moore

[Draft] 
[London, 28 July 1895] 
To L. Siebold, Esq., 
Sale, Cheshire 
 
Dear Sir, 
At the request of Mr F. Engels who is at present prevented by illness from 
writing in person, I am returning the enclosed letter to you. 636 
These fragments will certainly not pass muster as a History of Chemistry, 
312 according to Mr Engels. But were you to entitle them Researches in 
Magnetism (or Contributions to the History of Early Chemistry, Fragments by 
the late C. Schorlemmer, or something of that kind) you would not have to 
get anyone to edit or finish off the work. If the worst comes to the worst, you 
will have to have recourse to a journal which specialises in the history of 
chemistry. 
In sending you these views of Mr Engels at the latter’s behest, I remain, 
etc.

ENGELS’ LETTER TO THE EXECUTORS OF HIS WILL 
14 November 1894 631 
To the Executors named in my Will 
1) The following lines are supplementa ry and explanatory to my will. 
They express merely what are my wishes and are in no way legally binding 
upon my Executors. On the contrary, wherever they should be found to clash 
with the legal meaning of my will, they are to be disregarded. 
2) My distinct wish is that my body be cremated and my ashes thrown 
into the sea at the first opportunity. 
3) Immediately after my death I desire a copy of my will to be forwarded 
to my brother Hermann Engels, Barmen, or in case of his death to Hermann 
Engels junior, Engelskirchen, near Cologne. 
4) Unless Sam Moore is in England at the time of my death, and can 
attend at once to his executorship, Bernstein and Louise will have to act 
without his assistance. In that case and even if Sam Moore should not be in 
London but somewhere in England, I recommend them to make a copy of my 
will for their own use and hand the original to Crosse and Sons solicitors, 7 
Lancaster Place, Strand, to get it proved and to legally assist my executors. 
These latters will have to attend at once to the following points: 
 
a) To ascertain from Mess. Cross what steps they must take to obtain as 
soon as possible the full control of my balance at the Union Bank of London 
Limited Regent Street Branch and the right to dispose of such parts of my 
investments as may have to be sold to defray current expenses. 
b) To ascertain the value of my esta te. My furniture, books etc. will have 
to be valued. Mess. Cross will attend to that. The value of my investments in 
stocks, shares etc. at the time of my death can be calculated from the official 
stock and Share List with which my Stockbrokers Mess. Clayton and Aston, 
4 Tarnhouse buildings, Tolmhouse Yard, E. C, will supply my executors. 
a) As Messrs Cross will tell my executors, the various legacies in money 
made in my will are not to be paid in  the full nominal amount but are subject 
to deduction of the share of death duties appertaining to each of them. 
=====第566页=====
540 Supplement  
5) There will be found in my books various sums of money paid for a 
good many years back by me to Laura and Paul Lafargue, Percy and Ellen 
Rosher, Edward and Eleanor Marx-Aveli ng. These sums, as I wish to state 
expressly, do not represent loans owing to me, but are and always were free 
gift, on my part. They are therefore not to be claimed in any shape or form. 
6) In part-payment of the legacy left by me to Ellen Rosher, there is to be 
used by my executors the Reversion of certain funds payable to Percy Rosher 
after the death of his father and mother and which I bought from the said 
Percy Rosher. I desire it to be charged to Ellen Rosher at what it cost me, 
namely £250 paid to Percy Rosher a nd £30—solicitors’ expenses incurred on 
account of this transaction, in all £280-. 
7) I desire to supplement my will by the following details as to the 
disposal of papers left by me, viz; 
a) All papers in Karl Marx’s handwriting (except his letters to me) and 
all letters addressed to him (except those written by me to him) are to 
be restored to Eleanor Marx-Aveling as the legal representative of Karl 
Marx’s heirs. 
b) All letters written to me by Percy and Ellen Rosher, Laura and 
Paul Lafargue, Edward and Eleanor Ma rx-Aveling, or by my relations in 
Barmen and Engelskirchen, or by the Beust family in Zürich are to be 
restored to the writers thereof. 
That is all, I believe, I have to say.

P. S. It is understood that the honorar ium or royalties paid by Sonnenshein

NOTES  
1. Probably another part of a Gobelin tapest ry from the study of Gottfried Wilhelm von 
Leibniz. Ludwig Kugelmann had se nt two parts of this tapestry to Karl Marx on his birthday, 
8 May 1870. 
2. In his letter of 28 September 1892 Ludwig Kuge lmann informed Engels he had three copies 
of Herr Vogt which had been sent to him for custody on a commission from Karl Marx. 
Kugelmann expressed the desire to have them se nt to Engels so that the latter could dispose 
of them at his discretion. 
3. The rough copy of this letter written in Enge ls’ own hand is still available. Louise Kautsky 
copied the rough notes of the letter. Engels wrote in the word ‘hochachtungsvoll’ (with kind 
respects) and added his signature. The texts of the original letter and of the rough notes are 
identical. 
4. Working on the book Handbuch des socialismus, Hugo Lindemann and Carl Stegmann 
requested Engels in their letter to clarify ‘certain moot points’ and, if possible, grant them 
some journals not available in the British Museum. 
5. Addressing the 10th Congress of the French Workers’ Party on 25 September 1892 in 
Marseille (see Note 11) as a representativ e of German Social-Democracy, Wilhelm 
Liebknecht said the following, partly on the outcome of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 
and partly on the seizure of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany: ‘... the matter would be settled 
without any trouble once the social and democr atic Republic was established on both sides 
of the Rhine.’ This statement triggered rabid attacks in the French bourgeois press against 
the Socialists. Thus, in its editorial note of September 28 titled ‘Herr Liebknecht’, the 
newspaper La France urged his immediate expulsion from France. Meanwhile, Lucien 
Millevoye, deputy for the Nord in the Chambe r of Deputies, asked the Minister of the 
Interior: ‘Following the example of Mr. Lie bknecht, does the government of the Republic 
intend to tolerate that foreigners should come  to France in order to arouse hatred and con-
tempt for the French nation?’ 
6. Boulangism —a movement that emerged in France in the mid-1880s; named so after its 
leader,  General  Georges  Boulanger,   the War Minister  in   1886-87.  This  movement 
=====第570页=====
544 Notes 
expressed the views of reactiona ry chauvinism. Appealing to the injured national pride of the 
French in connection with the loss of Als ace-Lorraine in the Fran co-Prussian War of 1870-
71, the Boulangists succeeded for some time in  enlisting significant popular support in their 
cause and in influencing the army rank and f ile. Capitalising on popular discontent with the 
domestic policies of the bourgeois Republicans,  the Boulangists were preparing a coup 
d’etat to restore the monarchy in France. Yet the Boulangist movement suffered a fiasco due 
to steps taken by the Republican government with  the backing of progressive forces, and its 
leaders fled from France.  
7. On 9 September 1870 the Prussian authoritie s arrested members of the Brunswick-based 
Committee of the Social-Democratic Workers’  Party of Germany which was its steering 
body (Wilhelm Bracke, Leonhard von Bonhorst, Samuel Spier, Hermann August Kühn and 
Heinrich Gralle). These men were deported to th e fortress of Boyen (Lötzen) in East Prussia. 
The arrest came as a result of the promulgation of the Party’s Manifesto on 5 September 
1870 {Manifest des Ausschusses der Sozial-demokratischen Arbeiterpartei. An alle deutschen 
Arbeiter ! —Brunswick, den 5. September 1870) calli ng for protest meetings against the 
plans of the Prussian ruling circles to annex Alsace-Lorraine. Included in the text of the 
Manifesto were excerpts from the letter by Marx  and Engels to the Committee in reply to its 
request to clarify their opinion on the attitude of the German prolet ariat to the Franco-
Prussian War that had just begun (see presen t edition, Vol. 22, pp.  260-262). However, the 
names of the authors were not indicated therei n—it was said in the Manifesto that the text 
was written by ‘one of our oldest and most respected comrades in London’. On 23 
November 1871 the Committee members appeared before the district court on charges of 
breaking the public order laws and affiliati on with the International Working Men’s 
Association. The court sentenced the accused to prison terms ranging from 5 to 16 months. 
The sentence was commuted on appeal to 3 m onths, including the period of preliminary 
detention; it meant that they were virtually acquitted. 
8. Addressing a Reichstag session on 27 July 1870, August Bebel supported the Reichstag’s 
refusal to vote for credits to finance the wa r against France. On 26 November 1870, when 
the German Reichstag took up this issue again,  Bebel and Liebknecht demanded that credits 
be refused and peace with the French Republic promptly concluded w ithout annexations. On 
28 November the entire Social-Democratic group in  the Reichstag, together with Bebel and 
Liebknecht, voted against the granting of war credits. After the Reichstag session closed on 
17 December Bebel, Liebknecht and Hepner were  arrested and charged with high treason. 
9. All the required materials mentioned in the letter were handed over to  Paul Lafargue through 
Engels. But since Lafargue’s planned statem ent in the Chamber of Deputies never took 
place, Lafargue used them s ubsequently in his pamphlet La Démocratie Socialiste 
Allemande devant l’histoire which came from the press in L ille in 1893. It bore the follow-
ing imprint (after the Preface and the Afterword): Conseil national du Parti ouvrier. J. 
Guesde, P. Lafargue. 
10. The miners’ strike at Carmaux (Southern Fr ance) which continued from mid-August to early 
November 1892. The strike action was caused by the dismissal of one of the miners, 
Calvignac, the head of the local union, who had been elected to the pos t of town mayor. The 
workers demanded that the managers of the mine revoke their decision and, this demand 
having been refused, went on strike. This  stoppage became political in character. The 
governments arbitration actually sanctioned th e decision of the mine management. The 
French Workers’ Party came out in support of the strike action; a country-wide fund-  
=====第571页=====
Notes 545 
raising campaign was launched. Eventually the st rikers succeeded in getting Calvignac and other 
participants in the action reinstated.  
11. Marseille was the venue of the 10th Congress of the French Workers’ Party which contin 
ued in session from 24 to 28 September 1892. Th e Congress considered the party’s situa 
tion and its activities, its work in country dist ricts, the celebration of May Day, its partici 
pation in the International So cialist Congress of 1893 at Zuri ch, its participation in the 
forthcoming parliamentary election, among ot her issues. The Congress worked out an 
agrarian programme—its critical analys is is contained in Engels’ work The Peasant Question 
in France and Germany (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 481-502). The Congress also 
passed a decision not to participate in th e International Congress on an Eight-Hour 
Working Day convened by the British Trades-Unions  but to invite their representatives to 
the International Socialist Working Men’s Congress at Zurich.  
The French Workers’ Party {Le Parti ouvrier français) was set up by Marx’s followers— Jules 
Guesde and his supporters—by the decision of the Wo rkers’ Congress held in Marseille in 1879; this 
Congress endorsed the Party Rules. In 1880 Jules Guesde and Paul Lafa rgue drew up the Workers’ Party 
Programme, with Karl Marx taking part in framing its  theoretical chapter. In November 1880 a Workers’ 
Congress in Le Havre adopted the Party Programme by a majority vote whereby the French Workers’ 
Party took shape.  
12. A reference to August Bebel’s article ‘Ein intern ationaler Kongress für den Achtstundentag’ carried by 
Die Neue Zeit, Bd. 1, Nr. 2, Stuttgart, 1892-93. In his lette r to A. Bebel of 26 September 1892, Engels 
requested 12 copies of the article for circulation in  British newspapers (see present edition, Vol. 49, pp. 
485-89). 
13. Late in 1884 Bismarck, in a bid to intensify German y’s colonial policies, urge d the Reichstag to approve 
annual subsidies for steamship companies with the aim of organising regular voyages to East Asia, 
Australia and Africa. This demand caused a split within  the Social-Democratic faction in the Reichstag. 
The Left wing with August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebkn echt at the head spoke out against support for the 
government’s demand. The Right-wing majority in the faction (J.H.W Dietz, P. Frohme, G. 
Grillenberger) intended to vote for the subsidies on the pretext of furthering international ties. 
The Right-wing stand was condemned by the party’s ra nk and file and its central  organ, the newspaper 
Der Sozialdemokrat. As a result, the majority of the faction wa s compelled to modify their attitude to the 
government motion during Reichsta g debates in March 1885 by maki ng its ‘yes’ votes conditional on 
passage by the Reichstag of some of  the proposals of the faction (in pa rticular, the demand that ships for 
these lines be built only at German yards). Only after these demands had been turned down by the 
Reichstag did all the members of the Social-Democratic faction vote against.  
14. In his book Der Klassenkampf in der deutschen Sozialdemokratie (Zurich, 1892, p. 48), Hans 
Müller, representing Die Jungen (see Note 129) cited W. Liebknecht’s speech in the 
Reichstag on 31 May 1881.  
15- The Anti-Socialist Law (The Exceptional Law Against the Socialists) was introduced by the Bismarck 
government on a majority vote cast in the Reichsta g, on 21 October 1878 to combat the socialist and 
workers’ movement. It banned all party and mass work ers’ organisations, and th e socialist and workers’ 
press, and sanctioned c onfiscation of socialist literature a nd persecution of Social-Democrats. 
Nevertheless, the Social-Democratic Party, in acco rdance with Constitution preserved its group in the 
Reichstag. Assisted by Marx and Engels, the Party was able to overcome both the reformist and anarchist 
tendencies within its ranks and e xpand its base among the popular masse s by a skilful combination of 
legal and illegal methods of wo rk. Under pressure from the mass workers’ movement, the Anti-  
=====第572页=====
546 Notes 
Socialist Law was abrogated on 1 October 1890. For Engels’ assessment of the Law, see his 
article ‘Bismarck and the German Working Men’s Party’ (Vol. 24, pp. 407-09).  
16. The Independent Socialists Union was f ounded in Berlin on 8 November 1891 by repre-
sentatives of a semi-anarchist opposition group better known as The Young {Die Jungen) 
that was formed within the Social-Democra tic Party of Germany in 1890 (see Note 129). 
Separate groups of ‘Independent Socialists’ sprung up also in other towns—in Magdeburg, 
Wiesbaden, Fürth, and Freiburg (Baden-Würtemberg). The newspaper Der Sozialist, pub-
lished from 1891 to 1899, was the Union’s mouthpiece. The ‘Independents’ opposed any 
participation of Socialists in the parliament  (Reichstag) and other institutions of the bour-
geois state; they scoffed at the political str uggle of the working class and overrated the sig-
nificance of direct action so-called, or ‘revolu tionary mass action’. By the latter they meant 
work stoppages, boycotts and sabotage, as well as work at the grass-roots level in trade 
union locals. There was a good deal of infighti ng between the ‘Independent Socialists’ and 
the Anarchists—mainly for the newspaper Der Sozialist. The controversy between the two 
factions concerned above all the model of a so ciety of the future and ways of achieving it. 
Eventually the anarchists got the upper hand in the summer of 1893, a victory that caused 
the Union’s disintegration and demise in the spring of 1894. 
17. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard. It al so has the address in Engels’ handwriting: Herrn 
Dr. L. Kugelmann, Warmbüchenstr. 20.I. Hannover, Germany. 
18. The letter of Karl Marx and Frederick E ngels to the Committee of the German Social-
Democratic Workers’ Party. Only a fragment of it is preserved, one included in the text of 
the Brunswick Committee Manifesto (see Note 7). 
19. In his first speech in the Chamber of De puties on 8 December 1891 P.  Lafargue validated 
the substance of his motion to grant a genera l pardon for political prisoners. His speech was 
repeatedly interrupted by hecklers from among the bourgeois deputies. The Chamber 
defeated Lafargue’s motion. 
20. Blanquists ( les blanquistes) —supporters of Louis A. Blanqui who, after leaving the Workers’ 
Party {Le Parti français ouvrier, see Note 11), set up an organisation of their own, the 
Central Revolutionary Committee ( Comité Révolutionnaire Central) in 1880. After 
Blanqui’s death in 1881, E. Vaillant, E. Eude s and E. Granger came into the Committee’s 
leadership. The Blanquists upheld the slogan of  a general strike and advocated the inde-
pendence of labour unions from the party. They opted for political struggle at the expense of 
economic struggle. During Boulangism (see Note 6) the Blanquists broke into two factions; 
one with Edouard Vaillant at the head came out  against General Boulanger and thus made 
common cause with the Workers’ Party, while the other (E. Granger, E. Roche), having 
cooperated with the Boulangists, walked out  of the Central Revolutionary Committee and 
fell apart soon after. 
21. Allemanists {les allemanistes) —supporters of the French socia list Jean Allemane. After a split 
in the Possibilist Party (see No te 30), the Allemanists formed a Revolutionary-Socialist 
Workers’ Party {Le Parti ouvrier socialiste-révolutionnaire) in October 1890; this party 
existed up to 1905. Considering economic st ruggle above the political one and opposing 
excessive parliamentarism, the Allemanists con centrated their efforts on propaganda work in 
labour unions {les syndicats) and assigned the political party of the proletariat but a 
secondary role. A significant part of their activ ity was devoted to campaigns to win seats at 
municipal councils. 
22. Engels alludes to W Liebknechts speeches at rallies in Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Frankfurt a.M. 
and Offenbach on 2-4 October 1892 in which he reported on his trip as a represen-

was held in Marseille on 19-23 September 1892. Besides other issues (the organisational 
set-up of the labour-union movement, a genera l strike, May Day celebrations, female and 
child labour in industry), it discussed the d ecision of the Glasgow-held congress of the 
British trades-unions to convene an intern ational congress on 1 May 1893 on the issue of 
an eight-hour working day (see Note 24).  
The French syndicats, meeting in Marseille, decided not to take part in the congress 
convened by the British trades-unions; instead, it was decided to invite their representatives 
to the International Socialist Congress in Zurich.  
24. Engels means British Trades-Union Congre ss which was in session in Glasgow on 5-10 
September 1892. The Congress considered worker  representation in Parliament, cooperation, 
factory inspection, among other issues, and cam e out for an eight-hour working day. The 
British trades-unions refused to accept the invita tion to the International Socialist Congress 
which was to be convened in Zurich in th e summer of 1893 but decided to hold a parallel 
international congress in London on the struggle for an eight-hour working day. Qualifying 
this decision as an attempt to  split the international working- class movement, Engels sent 
letters to German and French socialists and as ked them to speak out against the plan of the 
British trades-unions. Engels al so addressed the socialist pa rties of Spain and Austria. 
25. This letter has never been found. 
26. Engels refers to Ludwig Schorlemmer’s lette r of 9 October 1892 in which he told Engels 
about the intention of Richard Anschütz to write Carl Schorlemmer’s biography and asked 
what Engels thought of that. 
27. In keeping with the decision of the Second International Socialist Working Men’s Congress 
held in Brussels on 16-22 August 1891 (see Note  228), the worker and socialist organisa-
tions of Switzerland, beginning January 1892, la unched preparations for the next congress 
due in Zurich in the summer of 1893. They set up an Organising Committee which included 
representatives of the Social -Democratic Party, of the Grütli Union (founded in 1838 as an 
enlightenment alliance of artisans and workmen,  it adhered to reformist positions) and of the 
trade-union amalgamation. In Fe bruary 1892, the Organising Comm ittee issued an appeal to 
the working men of all lands saying that it be gan its activities and urging them to send in 
suggestions concerning the congress agenda. 
28. The Parliamentary Committee—the executive body  of the Trades Union Congress of Great 
Britain that met in Manchester in 1868 a nd united the country’s unions. As of 1871 the 
Parliamentary Committee was elected at annual congresses of the Britis h trades-unions and, 
in fact, was their steering body in between the congresses. It nominated candidates to 
Parliament, supported draft bills tabled in the interests of the trades unions and worked to 
prepare regular trades-union congresses. 
29. Labour bourses {bourses du travail) was the name given in France to worker associations set 
up beginning with the latter half of the 1880s largely at the municipal councils of major 
towns and comprising representatives of various syndicats (labour unions). Such bourses du 
travail were initially supported by government bodies  and subsidised by them; thereby the 
government hoped to use these bourses as a ‘tool of social appeasement’ . Yet the activity of 
the labour bourses (labour exch anges) engaged in job placem ent of the unemployed (each 
bourse had a special department in charge  of that), in the organising of new syndicats in the

professional training of workers, and in st rike action soon caused apprehension among the 
government, and it started combatting their fu rther proliferation. The Saint-Etienne 
Congress of 1892 formed a federation of bourses du travail in which the Possibilists soon 
came to play a leading part (see Note 30). The Paris Bourse du travail was opened on 3 
February 1887. Using armed force, the French government seized the Paris Bourse on 7 July 
1892 and expelled labour union representatives. It cl osed the Bourse on the pretext that this 
body had ostensibly been prohibited by the law. The Bourse remained closed until 1896.  
30. Possibilists, or Broussists—a reformist trend in  the French Socialist movement which, in the 
1880s through the early 20th century, was headed by P. Brousse and B. Malon who caused a 
split in the French Workers’ Party (1882) and formed an independent party, The Workers’ 
Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries ( Le Parti ouvrier socialiste-révolutionnaire). It abided by 
the theory of municipal socialism as the ma instream idea. The Possibilists proclaimed a 
‘policy of possibilities’ ( la politique des possibilitées) as their principle. At the turn of the 
20th century they jo ined the French Socialist Party. 
31. In his letter of 10 October 1892 Victor Adler told Engels that the Austrian trades unions 
would ‘undoubtedly’ adopt a decision to stay away from the International Congress con-
vened by the British trades unions. The text of the resolution, he said , ‘had already been 
prepared’. In this connection he asked Engels to give him the address of the Parliamentary 
Committee to which he intended to send the text of the resolution. 
32. Engels refers to V. Adler’s German translation of the first volume of the book by Sergei 
Kravchinsky (alias Stepniak) The Russian Peasantry. Their Agrarian Condition, Social Life 
and Religion that was published in English in 1888 by Swan Sonnenschein & Co. In his let-
ter of 22 September 1892 Adler asked Engels to approach Stepniak so as to obtain formal 
permission from S. Sonnenschein to publish the German translation of the book, and pay the 
royalties due to the author and the publisher. Stepniak read the German edition and wrote a 
brief preface. The book appeared in  Stuttgart in 1893 under the title Der Russische Bauer 
(Dietz Publishers). 
33. In his preface to Volume II I of Das Kapital (written in October 1894), Engels noted that 
Part V presented ‘the chief obstacle in prepar ing it for the press’ (Division of profit into 
interest and entrepreneural income. Capital yi elding interest). Engels completed the bulk of 
this work in the spring of 1893 (see present edition, Vol. 37. pp. 8-9). 
34. Engels alludes to the issue of militarism discussed at the Second International Socialist 
Working Men’s Congress in Brussels in 1891 (see Note 228). 
35. The full text of this letter was first publishe d in English in: F. Engels and Paul and Laura 
Lafargue, Correspondence, Vol. 3, 1891-1895. Moscow, 1963. 
36. Engels refers to L. Millevoye’s statemen t in the Chamber of Deputies on 29 October 1892 
with a question concerning W. Liebknechts speech of 25 September 1892 in Marseille (see 
Note 5). P. Lafargue did not  attend that session. Millevoye thus broke his promise to 
Lafargue not to speak up before his (Lafargue’s) return from Carmaux. 
37. The French Workers’  Party (see Note 11) was not in a position to send its delegate to the 
Berlin congress of the German Social-Democratic Party (see Note 51). Instead, it sent a 
message of greetings signed by Guesde and Lafargue. 
38. Engels means the colonial war unleashed by  France against the West African state of 
Dahomey in 1890. In the latter half of November 1892 French troops captured the country’s 
capital. In 1893 Dahomey became a French col ony ruled by a governor-general. In the 
=====第575页=====
Notes 549 
course of this colonial expedition the French forces were the first to use artillery shells 
containing the powerful explosive, melinite.  
39. On 2 November 1892 the newspaper Le Figaro (No. 307) carried an interview with John 
Burns, an activist in the Br itish working-class movement and an MP. His interviewer was 
Jules Huret, a French journalist who, from 1 August 1892, had published a series of articles 
under the general heading ‘La question sociale—théo riciens et chefs de sectes’. J. Burns was 
reported as saying that as an adherent of gr adual reforms, he could not agree with the 
continental Socialists in their idea of a violent revolution; in his opinion, Britain had less of 
the antagonism between working men and capitalists than France. 
40. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard which likewise bears the address inscribed with his 
own hand: F.A. Sorge, Esq., Hoboken, N.J., U.S. America.  
41. In that letter Sergei Kravchinsky (alias, Stepniak) said he had sent to V. Adler the materials 
for the German edition of his book The Russian Peasantry. Their Agrarian Condition, Social 
Life and Religion (see Note 32). 
42. Engels probably means the proposal of the So lingen party organisation to the Berlin congress 
of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany (s ee Note 51) to limit the mandates of Social-
Democratic deputies to the Reichstag to 2 or 3 years in order to secure a rotation of elected 
deputies. Besides, the party local proposed to  expel Georg Schumacher from the Reichstag’s 
Social-Democratic parliamentary group. These proposals, together with amendments to the 
agenda tabled by other party locals, were published by the Berliner Volksblatt Vorwärts (No. 
259) on 4 November 1892. 
43. Fabians —members of the Fabian Society founde d in 1884 by democratic-minded intellec-
tuals. It was named after the Roman general of 3d century B.C., Quintus Fabias Maximus, 
surnamed Cunctator (‘the dela yer’) because of his cautious tactics in the war against 
Hannibal. The Fabian Society included such  prominent members as Sidney and Beatrice 
Webb, Bernard Shaw, H. Bland, among others. Its local organisations drew support from 
industrial workers who were attracted by a shar p critique of the capitalist order contained in 
Fabian publications. However, except in 1892,  when it attracted a number of otherwise 
‘homeless’ working-class socialists, the number of actual ‘practising’ workers (i.e., non-
official trade-union members) never exceeded 10 per cent of the identifiable membership, 
and perhaps even less if the total numbers were counted. Rejecting the possibility of a 
revolutionary transformation of bourgeois soci ety, the Fabians thought it was possible to 
shift from capitalism to socialism by implem enting reforms within the framework of so-
called municipal socialism. In 1900 the Fabian Society joined the Labour Party. 
44. Social Democratic Federation —a British socialist organisa tion set up in August 1884 on the 
basis of the bourgeois-radical Democratic Fede ration; it united heterogeneous socialist ele-
ments, predominantly intellectuals and a section of politically active workers. The 
Federation stated in its programme that the entire wealth of the nation should belong to 
Labour, its only source. It also set as its aim a socialisation of the means of production, dis-
tribution and exchange, and came out for a so ciety of ‘emancipated labour’. That was 
Britain’s first socialist programme based main ly on Marxist ideas. Th e leadership of the 
Federation was in the hands of Henry Hyndman, prone to authoritarian methods of guidance, 
and his supporters who did not deem it necessa ry to conduct work in the trades unions, a 
stance that inevitably led to isolation of the organisation from the working-class masses. A 
group of Socialists within the Federation (El eanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling, William 
Morris, Tom Mann and others) opposed Hyndman and championed closer ties with the 
working-class movement. The differences  on tactical issues and interna-

tional cooperation resulted in a split and the form ation of an independe nt organisation— The 
Socialist League (see Note 136).  
45. Apparently a reference to K. Kautsky’s ar ticle ‘Der Parteitag und der Staatssozialismus’ pub-
lished by the journal Die Neue Zeit, Bd. I, No. 7, 1892-93, S. 210-221, immediately after G. 
Vollmar’s article ‘Zur Streitfrage über den Staatssozialismus’. 
46. In his letter dated 18 October 1892, A. Bebel told Engels about his suggestion of having a 
new central Party weekly, Der Sozialdemokrat, instead of the unprofitable Die Berliner Volks-
Tribüne. This issue was resolved in 1893 at a party congress in Cologne. The weekly was 
being published from 3 February 1894 to December 1895 under the name Der 
Sozialdemokrat. Wochenblatt der Sozia ldemokratischen Partei Deutschlands; its editor was 
M. Schippel.  
47. Engels paraphrases the epigram C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre (‘It’s magnificent, 
but it’s not warfare’) ascribed to the French ge neral (subsequently, marshal) Pierre Bosquet. 
He was said to have uttered this phrase during the Crimean War of 1853-56. The words 
applied to the reckless bravery of the English ‘Charge of Light  Brigade’ at the Battle of 
Balaklava. 
48. Le Socialiste. Organe Central du Parti Ouvrier —it was planned to make this French Workers’ 
weekly a daily publication. Engels was watching closely the course of negotiations of which 
he had learned from Laura and Paul Lafa rgue. Yet this plan did not come off. 
49. From 6 August to 24 December 1892 the German Social-Democratic newspaper Die 
Berliner Volks- Tribüne was publishing (in its supplement) a series of articles by the Swiss 
Socialist Louis Héritier under the general title ‘Die Juraföderation und Michael Bakunin; the 
author’s name was indicated only in the final article. Proceeding from Bakuninist principles, 
the author gave a slanted picture of the histor y of the First International in Switzerland and 
vindicated the divisive activities of the Bakunini sts in particular, of the anarchist Jura 
Federation which, at its congress in La Ch aux-de-Fonds held between 4 and 6 April 1870, 
had broken away from the International secti ons in Roman Switzerland. In addition, the 
articles contained numerous innuendoes about the activity of the General Council, Marx and 
his associates, specifically, about Johann Phili pp Becker. Thus, it was claimed without any 
ground whatever that the London Conference of th e First International (1871) had been held 
in Marx’s house. The tenth article, published on 12 November 1892, contained particularly 
numerous distortions. Engels therefore decide d to speak out and refute the insinuations 
without waiting for the end of the series. He se nt his statement, together with the present 
letter, to August Bebel for delivery to the editorial board of Die Berliner Volks-Tribüne. The 
newspaper published Engels’ statement on 19 N ovember 1892 (see present edition, Vol. 27, 
pp. 344-46). On 24 December 1892 L. Héritier offered his reply, which was published 
together with his final article. As in his le tter to Engels of 15 December 1892, Héritier tried 
to rebut the accusations. See also Engels’ le tters: to Héritier of 20 January 1893 and to 
Kautsky of 25 March 1895 (see this volume, pp. 85-6, 481). 
50. On 14 November 1892 British Socialists held a rally in London’s Trafalgar Square to com-
memorate the fifth anniversary of the ‘B loody Sunday’ of 13 November 1887, when a 
socialist meeting culminated in clashes w ith the police. Several hundred demonstrators 
received injuries (three, fatal injuries),  and some organisers were arrested. 
Louise Kautsky’s account, which Engels men tions in his letter, was published without 
any title by Die Arbeiter Zeitung {no. 49) on 2 December 1892.

Notes 551 
51. The Berlin Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany took place on 14-21 November 1892. It 
heard the reports of the Party’s Executive and of its Reichstag group, and discusse d issues related to May 
Day celebrations in 1893, as well as the economic cris is and its consequences, the boycott tactics, the 
attitude to anti-Semitism, etc. After lengthy debate s the Congress adopted a resolution that contained a 
negative attitude to state socialism (see Note 84). Th e delegates also rejected the invitation to an 
International Congress that was to  be convened in Glasgow by decision of the British Trades-Union con-
gress (see Note 24) and came out for participation in the Internationa l Socialist Working-Men’s Congress 
in Zurich in 1893. 
52. The Berlin Congress of the German Social-Democratic  Party (see Note 51) also discussed the issue of the 
newspaper Vorwärts, the Party’s central organ, whose editor was Wilhelm Liebknecht. He became the 
target of sharp criticism by Party members who objected  to the allegedly high salary he was receiving for 
editing the Vorwärts and for his nonchalance, as it was claimed, in discharging that responsibility. 
53. Engels refers to the proposal of the Executive of the German Social-Democratic Party and of the Party’s 
parliamentary group in the Reichstag to the Berlin Party Congress (see No te 51) to purchase all the newly 
established Social-Democratic newspapers and turn them  into official organs of the Party. The Congress 
turned down this proposal. 
54. The International Socialist Working-Men’s Congre ss held in Brussels in 1891 (see Note 228) adopted a 
resolution which recommended, wherever it was possibl e, to combine May Day celebrations with work 
stoppages. All the delegates, including those from Germ any, voted for this resolution, even though during 
the discussion on this issue the British and the German delegations had insisted on this action being held 
on the first Sunday of May. The Be rlin Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party (see Note 51) 
passed a decision to celebrate May Day 1893 on the ev ening of May 1 and refrain from general work 
stoppages owing to the bad economic situation in the country. 
55. In his address to the Berlin congress of the German Social-Democratic Party on 17 November 1892, A. 
Bebel vindicated the proposal to hold 1893 May Day celebrations in Germany without staging work 
stoppages on May 1. V. Adler, who was attending th e Congress as a representative of the Austrian 
socialists, opposed this proposal in a speech he made the same day. 
56. Engels means the Third International Socialist Wo rking-Men’s Congress due at Zurich in 1893 (see Note 
229). 
57. At the bottom of this letter was a hand-drawn pictur e of a theatre stage. Engels signed his name just 
where the proscenium was depicted. 
58. Engels refers to the characters of the Grimm brothers’ fairy-tale Sieben Schwaben.  
59. An allusion to George Bernard Shaw’s letter to A. Bebel of 29 May 1892 which Engels had copied. This 
letter was published in a supplement to Volume 49 of the present edition, p. 563; in it Shaw pointed to the 
need of an alliance between the Socialists and the Liberals in the election campaign. The only chance for 
the Socialists to win the election, he wrote to Bebel, was ‘to force th e Liberals to accept our men as their 
party candidates’. According to Shaw, the Fabians were ‘compelled’ to force their candidates on the 
Liberals, or otherwise ‘at every election’ they would ‘suffer defeat and disgrace’. 
In his letter to Kautsky on 4 September 1892, Engels  analysed the Fabian electoral tactics and the 
causes of the defeat of the Fabian candidates on the Liberal list during the 1892 elections, (see present 
edition, Vol. 49, p. 514).

60. The Panama affair—a shady transaction conn ected with the bribery of French statesmen, 
government officials and the press by the Pa nama Canal joint-stock company set up in 
France in 1880 at the at the initia tive of Ferdinand de Lesseps for building a canal across of 
the isthmus of Panama. In December 1888 the company declared its  insolvency which 
caused the ruin of small-time shareholders and numerous bankruptcies. This scandal 
compelled the French authorities to start an investigation. On 19 November 1892 the 
Monarchists tabled three questions on the Pana ma crash in the Chamber of Deputies which 
on 21 November elected a Commission of Inquiry of 33 with M. Henri Brisson, a Radical, as 
chairman. The Commission obtained irrefutabl e evidence implicating a number of high-
ranking officials, e.g., the former French prem ier CL. de Freycinet and others who had been 
bribed by the Lesseps company which wanted to conceal its true financial situation and 
embezzlements. French justice hushed up the a ffair by going no furthe r than condemning F. 
Lesseps and a number of his cat’s-paws (see Note 157). ‘Panama’ became a byword for 
major dealings in which government officials were implicated. 
61. Engels means the pronouncements of Emile de Girardin, a French bourgeois journalist and 
editor of the newspaper La Presse, in 1846-47 with sensational charges levelled at some 
figures of the July monarchy and the Guizot ministry whom he accused of corruption (the 
selling of peerage, bribery of the press, etc.); these statements fomented a crisis which 
culminated in the Revolution of 1848. For details, see Engels’ article The Decline and 
Approaching Fall of Guizot. —Position of the French Bourgeoisie (see present edition, Vol. 6, 
pp. 213-19). 
62. This refers to the London German Workers’ Educational Society. Founded in 1840 by Karl 
Schapper, Joseph Moll, Heinrich Bauer and other activists of the League of the Just. In 1847 
and 1849-50 Marx and Engels took part in the wo rk of the Society. With the foundation of 
the First International it joined the Intern ational Working-Men’s Association. The London 
Educational Society continued in existen ce under different names until 1918 when it was 
closed by the British government. 
63. A reference to the soirée arranged on 17 November 1892 by the Social-Democrats of Berlin 
for delegates of the Party Congress (see Note 51). 
64. Engels wrote this letter in two languages, English and Spanish. 
65. The envelope of this letter exists on which Engels wrote the address: An das 
sozialdemokratische Parteisekretariat, Katzbachstr. 9, Berlin S. W, Germany. 
66. Engels wrote this facetious letter in reply to  the birthday greetings sent to him on behalf of 
the Secretariat of the Social-Democratic Pa rty of Germany by Ignaz Auer and Richard 
Fischer on 27 November 1892. Jakob Bamberger made a postscript to the message and 
joined in the greetings on Engels’ 72nd birthday. 
67. Apparently an allusion to Louise Kautsky’ s cooperation with the Vienna-published news-
paper Arbeiterinnen-Zeitung. 
In his letter to Laura Lafargue of 2 Octobe r 1891 (see present edition,  Vol. 49, p. 251) on 
the forthcoming release of the newspaper’s first number, Engels described it ‘a hyaena 
paper’. The epithet ‘hyaena is from Schiller’s poem The Song of the Bell m which the poet 
compares revolutionary women to hyenas.  
68. Ultramontanes —the Italian party of the Roman Cat holic Church favouring the doctrine of 
papal supremacy and the Pope’s right to inte rfere in the secular affairs of any state. 
69. On 21 November 1892 Paul Stumpf greeted  Engels on his 72nd birthday and three days 
later, on 24 November, sent him as a birthda y gift a special issue of the newspaper Mainzer

Notes 553 
Journal which came from the press on 23 November 1892; it had the following dedication: 
‘Unserem Papa zum 72sten Geburtstage’ (‘To our Papa on his 72nd birthday’). The number 
dealt with the returns of an election to the municipal council of Mainz which brought a 
significant victory for the Social-Democrats.  
70. Engels refers to events in Mainz during its occupation by the French revolutionary army in 
October 1792 - July 1793 when the French m ilitary authorities set up a provisional admin-
istration there. The Mainz democrats formed a Society of Equality and Freedom Friends ( The 
Mainz Club). The Rhineland-German National Convent  elected in February 1793 deposed 
the Kurfürst (Elector) and proc laimed Mainz and adjacent dist ricts a republic which joined 
France in March 1793. The decree of the Fr ench National Convent of 15 December 1792 
abolished feudal dependence priv ileges of the nobility and clergy; also, the Mainz Republic 
was to pay an indemnity to France. In July 1793, after a siege of many months, Mainz was 
overrun by Prussian troops which restored the Kurfürst back in power and the old body 
politic. 
71. Centre —a political party of German Roman Catho lics formed in 1870-71 as a result of uni-
fication between the Catholic factions in th e Prussian Landtag and the German Reichstag 
(the seats of their deputies used to be in th e centre of the assembly hall). The Centre Party 
would take an intermediate stand, as a ru le, by manoeuvering between the parties that 
backed the government and the Left-wing oppos ition groups of the Reichstag. It rallied 
under the banner of Catholicism the socially he terogenous strata of the clergy, the landed 
aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, that part of the peasantry predominantly in small and medium-
sized states, as well as Roman Catholic working men in Western and South-Western 
Germany. The Centrists, while being in opposition to the Bismarck government, voted 
nonetheless for its anti-labour and anti-Socialist enactments. Engels gave a detailed analysis 
of the Centre in his work The Role of Force in History (see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 453-
511) and in the article What’s Next? (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 7-11). Since in 1893 
the Centre Party had 196 seats in the Reichstag out  of 397, it could play a decisive role in the 
event of differences among other parties. 
72. The Brimstone Gang (Die Schwefelbande) —the name of a student’s association at Jena 
University in the 1770s; its members were notorious for their brawls. In his work Mein 
Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung. Stenographischer Bericht, Dokumente und 
Erläunterungen, Geneva, 1859, K. Vogt, a German pe tty-bourgeois democrat, called Marx 
and his supporters “The Brimstone Ga ng”. Marx responded with the lampoon Herr Vogt 
which came out in London in December 1860 (see present edition, Vol. 17). 
73. In October 1890 Karl Liebknecht began a course  in law at Berlin University. He completed 
this course in March 1893 and, after passing an examination in October 1893, obtained the 
rank of a Referender (a low-rank official in Germany, us ually a lawyer, on probation at court 
of law or government office). 
74. ‘In Geldfragen hört die Gemütlichkeit auf (lite rally, ‘In money matters there is no room for 
sentiments’—’Where money begins, benevolen ce ends’). Engels cites the phrase from a 
statement from one of the leaders of the Rhin eland liberal bourgeoisie and Prussian Finance 
Minister David Hansemann at a session of th e first United Landtag of Prussia on 8 June 
1847. 
75. The Ems dispatch—a report on the results of  negotiations held between the Prussian King 
William I and the French Ambassador M. Bene detti in the town of Ems concerning the 
candidacy of Prince Leopold Hohenzollern to the Spanish throne; this dispatch was sent to 
Bismarck on 13 July 1870. William I declined th e demand of the French side that Prussia

desist from Hohenzollern’s claim to the Spanish th rone. Being in receipt of this epistle, Bismarck 
abridged the text in such a way that it acquired a st ridently insulting connotation for France and, then and 
there, passed it on for publication in all German news agencies. The promulgation of the Ems dispatch in 
that form was a public insult to France and served as  an immediate pretext for the Franco-Prussian War. 
The fraud came to light only many years after the event.  
In the summer of 1891 W. Liebknecht published the pamphlet Die Emser Depesche oder wie Kriege 
gemacht werden in Nuremberg, in which he collected s undry documents on this episode and exposed 
Bismarck’s bellicose policies. In October 1892 Bismarck  actually admitted the deception. ‘It is so easy... 
completely to alter the meaning of a speech, without forgery, but by simple omission’, he said in an 
interview. ‘I once tried this myself, as editor of the Ems telegram... The King sent it to me with the order 
to publish it either in whole or in part, and af ter I had edited it to my taste, by cancelling and 
condensation, Moltke, who was with me, exclaimed, “A few minutes ago it was a charade; now it is a 
fanfare.”‘  
76. An allusion to the draft law tabled in the Reic hstag on 23 November 1892 by the War Minister Werd and 
the General Staff Chief Waldersee providing for an increase in the numerical strength of the German 
armed forces within the next seven years. The mean  annual strength of this army was fixed at 492,068; it 
was proposed to introduce a two-year term of serv ice in the Infantry, which could increase the war 
machine’s throughput by 30 per cent. The planned increas e in the strength of the land forces exceeded all 
the previous increments, as of 1874, combined. It wa s planned to compensate the significant growth in 
the war expenditures by raising taxes on consumer goods. This elicited widespread discontent among the 
popular masses and with some bourgeoi s political parties as well. On 6 May 1893 the Reichstag majority 
rejected the draft bill of the government. The same day the Kaiser dissolved the Reichstag two years 
ahead of time. After a new election, in June 1893, a similar draft law was e ndorsed by the Reichstag. 
77. Engels probably means the intention of W. Gladst one’s Liberal Government in Britain to grant Home 
Rule for Ireland (see Note 171). The decision to table a draft bill to this effect was largely due to 
conditions attending the formation of the Gladstone cab inet after parliamentary elections in the summer 
of 1892 when the Liberals could form the government onl y with the the backing of the Irish deputies. The 
Home Rule Bill was introduced in February 1893 and,  after heated debates and agitation throughout the 
spring and summer, was adopted by the Commons but turned down by the House of Lords, as had been 
the case in 1886. 
78. This is in reply to Charles Bonnier’s letter to Engels of 2 December 1892 in which he protested against 
the decision of the Berlin Congress of the German So cial-Democratic Party (see Note 51) to refrain from 
work stoppages on 1 May 1893 and have May Day cel ebrations on the evening of the same day. 
79. In a letter addressed to Engels on 2 December 1892 Charles Bonnier agreed that in Britain May Day 
celebrations were to be held on the first Sunday of May, as it had been in 1890 and 1891 (see also 
Engels’ article May 4 in London; present edition. Vol. 27, pp. 61-67). 
80. A. Bebel’s article ‘Die Maifeier und ihre Bedeutung’ published by the journal Die Neue Zeit, Bd. 1, No. 
14, Stuttgart, 1892-93. 
81. The attitude to the Austrian Social-Democrats which Engels expressed in  this letter was further 
elaborated in his message of greetings to Aust rian working men on May Day 1893 (see present edition, 
Vol. 27).

82. In his letter of 22 November 1892 A. Bebel wrote the following about what Engels had thought of the 
Social-Democratic party press: ‘If you mean the nationalisation (Verstaatlichung) of our press, you must 
be utterly misinformed. All the newspapers without  exception are independent, including those that are 
getting money from us. We never sought to exert pressure  even in cases when it was absolutely necessary 
in the Party’s interests.’ 
83. A. Bebel’s article ‘Der Pa rteitag der deutschen Sozialdem okratie’ published by the journal Die Neue Zeit, 
Bd. 1, No. 10, Stuttgart, 1892-93. It dealt with the wo rk of the Berlin Congress (see Note 51) and stressed, 
in particular, the significance of the decision to  hold 1893 May Day celebrations in Germany on the 
evening of May 1. 
84. The reference is to the resolution of the Berlin  Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party (see 
Note 51) condemning state socialism. Proposed by W. Liebknect and G. Vollmar, the resolution was 
adopted by the Congress on 18 November 1892. 
85. Because of the drop in circulation of the journal Die Neue Zeit, J.H.W. Dietz suggested certain changes in 
its content and periodicity. Thus, the arts and current politics sections were to be  expanded at the expense 
of the theoretical part. 
86. Radicals —in the 1880s-1890s, a parliamentary group in Fran ce that used to belong to the party of 
moderate Republicans (the ‘Opportunists’). The Radi cals relied chiefly on the petty bourgeoisie and, to 
some extent, on the middle bourgeoisie; they suppor ted certain bourgeois-demo cratic demands like a 
unicameral parliament, separation of the Church from the state, a progre ssive income tax, limitation of the 
working day and other social issues. The Radicals were led by G. Clemenceau. Officially the group 
became known as the Republican Radical and Radical-Soc ialist Party (Parti républicain radical et radical-
socialiste), formed in 1901. 
87. Opportunists —a party of moderate bourgeois Republican s which emerged after the 1881 split in the 
Republican Party and the formation of the left-wing Radical Party with George s Clemenceau as its head 
(see Note 86). This name was introduced in 1877 by th e journalist Henri Rochefort who coined it from the 
words of L. Gambetta, the leader of the ‘Moderates’ , that reforms should be implemented ‘at an opportune 
time’ (‘en temps opportun).  
88. An extract from P. Lafargue’s letter to Engels was published by the newspaper Vorwärts (No. 286) on 6 
December 1892 without the author’s name being indicat ed. Appended to the text was an editor’s note: 
‘Man schreibt uns aus Pari s über den Panama-Skandal’. 
89. The Fourth International Gla ss Workers’ Congress took place in L ondon on 5-9 July 1892. An account of 
its proceedings was released in a separate edition the same year: The Fourth Report of the International 
Union of Glass Workers and Report of the Third International Congress, London, 1892. 
90. On 27 November 1892 the Social-Democratic group in  the Reichstag cabled a message of greetings to 
Engels on the occasion of his birthday. On behalf of  the group the telegram wa s signed by August Bebel, 
Heinrich Meister and Paul Singer. 
91. A reference to a journal on the i ssues of social and economic history— Die Zeitschrift fur Sozial- und 
Wirtschaftsgeschichte published by S. Bauer, C. Grünberg, L.M. Hartmann and E. Szanto. The journal 
appeared from 1893 to 1900 in Leipzig, Freiburg and Weimar. 
92. Engels sent Kautsky his article A Newly-Discovere d Case of Group Marriage’ (see present edition, Vol. 
27) for publication in the journal Die Neue Zeit. Its subject-matter drew on a 
=====第582页=====
556 Notes 
publication in the Russian-language newspaper Pycckue Begomocmu (No. 284, 14 October 1892) dealing 
with findings of the Russian ethnographer L. Sternberg  who had been studying the life and society of the 
Sakhalin Gilyaki, a small ethnic group otherwise known as the Nivkhi (Nivkhs). In his article Engels cited 
the text of the original almost verbatim, with only a few deviations.  
93. On 24 November 1892 P. Lafargue wrote to Engels : ‘From the international standpoint Bebel behaves 
himself but very poorly by permitting Liebknecht, to put  himself right. Their alliance is impossible for the 
German party’. 
94. An allusion to the ‘Free Theatres’ trend in the fin-de-siècle West European art. The ‘Free Theatres’ 
expressed the protest of progressive actors and playwrights agai nst the conservatism of the state-run 
stage, its isolation from life and the contemporary art, against censorship,  etc. Such theatres appeared in 
major European cities in the late 1880s and early 1890s. 
95. This letter, written by Louise Kautsky at the reque st of Engels, was in repl y to Ellenbogens letter of 2 
December 1892 in which he said he had sent Engels  his pamphlet on the history of the Workers’ 
Educational Society in one of Vienna’s districts.  Ellenbogen added he was sending a copy from the first 
edition that had been confiscat ed by the Austrian police. 
The envelope of the former lette r has the address inscribed on it: ‘Dr. W. Ellenbogen. IX Bergstrasse 
18. Vienna. Austria’ ....  
96. The envelope of this letter has likewise been preser ved, with the inscription written by Engels: ‘Monsieur 
Pierre Lavroff, 328, rue St. Jacques, Paris, France’. 
97. In his letter of 12 December 1892 P. Lavrov asked for permission to publish H. Lopatin’s letter of 20 
September 1883 to M. Oshanina, member of the Executive of the illegal Russian Revolutionary 
organisation (‘People’s Freedom’). In  it Lopatin gave the gist of his talk with Engels in London on 19 
September 1883 concerning the prospects of a revolution in Russia. 
An excerpt from this letter was publishe d in Geneva in March 1893 in the book Foundations of 
Theoretical Socialism as Applied to Russia; see also present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 591-93.  
98. Engels described these events in his letters to P.  Lafargue of 31 January and 6 February 1891, and to F. 
Sorge of 11 February 1891 and 4 March 1891; see pr esent edition, Vol. 49, pp. 115, 121, 125, 137. 
99. On 13 December 1892 A. Bebel made a long speech in  the Reichstag criticising the draft military law 
tabled by the government (see Note 76). 
The Heinze Law —a package of laws against prostitution, dr afted in the wake of  the 1891-92 trial of a 
Heinze, a pimp, accused of murder and burglary. Th e Heinze Law, tabled in the Reichstag in 1891 and 
envisaging heavier penalties for pandering, pimpi ng and propagation of por nographic literature, was 
adopted after long debates only in 1900.  
Speaking during the Heinze Law debates in the Re ichstag on 15 December 1892, A. Bebel attacked 
the bigotry and hypocrisy of the then acting Ge rman laws on prostitution. The Bebel speech was 
published in a supplement to Vorwärts (No. 295) on 16 December 1892.  
100. In 1888 the Panama Canal Company (see Note 60), assi sted by the bribed Chamber deputies and acting in 
circumvention of the French laws forbidding lotte ries, gained permission to issue lottery-loan bonds.

101. Engels sent this letter to A. Bebel (together with a letter addressed to Bebel personally, not 
available today) who, at Engels’ request, sent it to K. Kautsky. 
102. Engels refers to The Theories of Surplus Value which were a component part of the 1861-63 
manuscript of the second preliminary variant of Das Kapital (see present edition, Vols. 30-
34). In 1889-90 Engels gave a part of The Theories of Surplus Value to Kautsky for deci-
phering. He thus hoped to get assistance in pr eparing the MS for the press and in coaching 
expert editors and publishers of the Marxian manuscripts. Engels did not live to see the 
publication of The Theories of Surplus Value as Volume IV of Das Kapital. It was K. Kautsky 
who published them in 1905-10. The Theories of Surplus Value were also published in The 
Complete Works of Marx and Engels in the languages of the original (MEGA, Abteilung II , 
Bd. 3, Teile 2-4, Berlin). 
103. A fragment of this letter was first published in English in: The Labour Monthly, L., 1934, 
No. 10. 
104. Engels refers to a scandal that broke out  in 1892 over the bankruptcy of the building society 
‘Liberator’ and its affiliated banks  and building societies. It was stated that upwards of seven 
million sterling had been invested in these unde rtakings, chiefly by the working and poorer 
trades classes. 
105. L. Baare, a German industrialist and director of the Bochum Steel Company, was taken to 
court for tax evasion and other machinations. Th e issue of rifles (nearly half a million) sup-
plied to the German army by the Jewish firm  Löwe & Co. was on the Reichstag agenda in 
1892. That same year Hermann Ahlwardt’s anti-Sem itic pamphlet Neue Enthüllungen. 
Judenflingen came off the press in Dresden. It accuse d Isidor Löwe, an arms manufacturer, 
of supplying faulty rifles to the German army. The owners of the firm sued the author for 
libel. In December 1892 Ahlwardt was found guilty  on libel charges and sentenced to five 
months in prison.  
106. Engels means flagrant abuses in the activ ity of the Banca Romana which came to light dur-
ing debates held in the Italian Parliament  in December 1892-January 1893. Implicated in 
these shady dealings were statesmen, MPs, lawyers, journalists and private individuals. The 
scandalous affair came to be known as Panamino, a hint at the Panama Company fraud. The 
debates were sparked off by a statement of one  of the deputies, Napol eone Colajanni. Engels 
responded by the article ‘The Italian Panama ’ (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 356-60) 
published in the newspaper Vorwärts in February 1893. For more detail about the Panama 
sobriquet, see Note 60. 
107. The editors of the present edition do not have at their disposal the original of Engels’ letter 
to Karl Henckell. The phrase quoted here came from the notes on the poem ‘The Steam-
King’ by E.P Mead, an English workman and poet; these verses were published in a 
collection of revolutionary poetry, Das Buch der Freiheit, published in Berlin in December 
1893. This edition wa s sponsored by the Social-Democratic  group in the Reichstag. In the 
course of his work K. Henckell asked Engels  on 2 November 1892 for verses and songs that 
could be included into the collection and also fo r the texts of his letters to be sent to the 
English poets Swinburne and W. Morris. E ngels must have responded favourably to 
Henckell’s request. Besides the verses of Swinbur ne, Morris, Goethe, Heine, Schiller, Byron, 
Mickiewicz and the Russian poets Pushkin, Ry leyev and Nekrasov, the anthology included 
the poem ‘The Steam-King’ which Engels had tr anslated into German  (see present edition, 
Vol. 6, pp. 474-77) and the old Danish folk s ong ‘Herr Tidman’, also translated by Engels 
(see present edition, Vol. 20 pp. 34-35).

108. A. Labriola’s translation of The Manifesto of the Communist Party into Italian was not pub-
lished at that time; the Italian edition of th is work in Pompeo Bettini’s translation was 
released in Milan in 1893 by the journal Critica Sociale Publishers. Engels wrote a special 
preface to that edition—’To the Italian Reader’,  translated by Turati (see present edition, 
Vol. 27). The booklet also included the prefaces  published in the fourth German edition of 
The Manifesto that came out in London in 1890—the publication that Engels mentions in his 
letter. AtTurati’s request, Engels sent it to him in January 1893. 
109. A ugust Bebel was visiting Engels in London as guest on 3-10 January 1893. 
110. Engels wrote the following lines on a postcard. He also wrote the address: Mrs. Mendelson 
27, Stonor Road, West Kensington, W. 
111. Maria Mendelson, a Polish socialist, told Engels a bout the arrest in France on 7 January 
1893 of Polish emigres accused of plotting to a ssassinate the Russian Czar Alexander II I. 
Engels’ article exposing the collaboration of th e French and Russian police ‘On the Latest 
Caper of the Paris Police’ (see present edition, Vol. 27), was published anonymously by the 
newspaper Vorwärts (No. 11) on 13 January 1893 in the section Politische II bersicht. The 
following editorial note was attached to the article: ‘We are getting word from most com-
petent quarters about the escapade of the Paris police that we reported yesterday’. 
112. After Carl Schorlemmer’s death on 27 June 1892 his friends and associates intended to set 
up a Schorlemmer laboratory at Victoria University in Manchester. Their plans were 
realised. 
113. An abridged version of this le tter in English was first published in: The Labour Monthly, L., 
1934, No. 12. 
114. The Independent Labour Party was founded by leaders of the new trades unions at the 
Bradford Conference on 13-14 January 1893 in a situation characterised by the mounting 
strike action and the movement for a greater sa y of the British working class in politics. This 
party was headed by Keir Hardie. In its programme the Independent Labour Party cham-
pioned collective ownership of the means of production, an eight-hour  day, prohibition of 
child labour, social insurance, unemploymen t allowances, among other demands. The party 
leadership focused on parliamentary forms of struggle in its practical activities. In 1900 the 
Independent Labour Party joined the Labour Party. 
115. The Hague (Fifth) C ongress of the First International he ld on 2-7 September 1872. It was in 
fact the last congress of the First Internationa l. Its work was directed by Marx and Engels. 
116. Engels means the Left Wing of the British Conservative Party in which the industrial bour-
geoisie and intellectuals (men-of-letters, lawyer s, etc.) were represented. The Conservative 
Left-Wingers came forward with a demagogic programme of social reforms in a bid to win 
working men’s votes during election campaigns. 
117. In this letter Sorge wrote to Engels that a few days before, the editor of Die New Yorker 
Volkszeitung, Friedrich Schlüter, had been visited by  a group of Polish emigres who wished 
to learn about the newspaper’s stand on an upr ising which allegedly was to take place in 
Poland. 
There was a welcome ceremony at Kronstadt in July 1891 for a French naval squadron to 
demonstrate a rapprochement between tsarist Russia and France. The two countries, 
meanwhile, were holding diplomatic negotiations  which, in August 1891, terminated in the 
signing of an agreement whereby France a nd Russia undertook the commitment to consult 
each other on foreign policy issues and to co me to terms on steps which both governments 
were to take in case of the threat of an a ttack on either. Further talks led to the signing of

a Franco-Russian military convention in A ugust 1892 which envisaged joint military oper-
ations if either side was attacked. This convention was an important landmark toward a 
Franco-Riussian alliance which was sealed with the ratification of the convention by both 
governments on 27 December 1893—4 January 1894. Seeking to enlist Poland’s support in 
the event of a war with Russia,  the German ruling quarters took steps in the early 1890s to 
soften the German policies in the wester n Polish lands under German jurisdiction, 
specifically by relaxing the police surveillan ce over Polish national societies, by making 
concessions in teaching the Polish language at school, and so on.  
118. A reference to the L ondon Conference of the First International on 17-23 September 1871. 
Convened under the conditions of vicious repr isals on the International and its members 
after the defeat of the Paris Commune of 1871, this forum had a relatively narrow repre-
sentation; taking part were 22 delegates with casting votes and 10 with consultative voices. 
Countries that were unable to send their dele gates were represented by correspondent sec-
retaries. Marx represented Germany, and Engels Italy. Nine closed sessions were held all in 
all. No communiqués were released on the pr oceedings. The resolutions of the Conference 
were published only in November and Decem ber 1871. One of the resolutions, ‘On the 
Political Action of the Working Class’, outlined  the fundamental principle of the interna-
tional working-class movement—the need for setting up an independent  proletarian party. 
The keynote of the Conference was the struggle of Marx, Engels and their followers against 
the Bakunin trend as epitomised by the Jura Federation (see present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 
423-31). 
119. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: Marx, K., Engels, F. Selected 
Correspondence. M., F.L.P. H., 1955. 
120. In the 1885 parliamentary debates on the budget, the Irish MPs headed by Ch. S. Parnell, 
who were dissatisfied with the policy of the Gl adstone cabinet toward Ireland, joined hands 
with the Conservatives and forced the Gladstone government to resign. The Salisbury 
Conservative Cabinet that came to power lasted  only six months. The parliamentary election 
of December 1885 gave no decisive margin to any of the contesting parties. With the 
Liberals gaining a few more seats in Parliame nt, Gladstone was able to form a new cabinet, 
this time with the backing of the Irish deputies. As the new cabinet head, Gladstone tabled 
two bills in 1886—on the Irish agrarian legisl ation and on Home Rule (see Note 171), both 
favourable to Ireland. In the 1892 election Gladst one formed an allian ce with the Irish MPs 
again and, in 1893, tabled a second draft of the Home Rule; but neither the first nor the 
second bill succeeded. 
121. This addendum to Article 69 of the Crimin al Code was suggested by Victor Rintelen, a 
centrist deputy, in Reichstag debate s (15 December 1892) on its amendment. 
122. Reptiles, the reptilian pre ss—an expression that gained wi de currency after Bismarck’s 
speech in the Prussian Chambe r of Deputies on 30 January 1869, when he used the word 
‘reptiles’ to denigrate opponents of the govern ment. The Left-Wing press, taking up this 
epithet, applied it to the semi-official press br ibed by the Bismarck government and to jour-
nalists working for it. 
123. Engels alludes to a three percent interest  loan which France agr eed to grant Russia in 
September 1891 to a sum of 125 million gold roubl es (or 500 million francs). The loan was 
a great success initially, with the sum of 125 m illion being surpassed se ven-and-a-half-fold 
during the subscription. But then, because of th e dramatic fall in the rate of Russian secu-
rities at European exchanges as  a result of the 1891 famine in Russia and the country’s wors-
ening economic situation, subscribers refuse d to accept the bonds. In a bid to prevent a 
=====第586页=====
560 Notes 
total crash, the Russian government was compelled to buy up a portion of the bonds. As a 
consequence, bonds worth only 96 million roubles were sold.  
124. Engels uttered this idea in his article ‘T he Foreign Policy of Russian Tsardom’ (see present 
edition, Vol. 27, pp. 11-49). 
125. After the death in January 1892 of the Turkish Viceroy (Khedive) of Egypt, Tewfik, his suc-
cessor Khedive Abbas Hilmi II  made an atte mpt to steer a policy independent of Great 
Britain. However, in January 1893 the British Consul General in Egypt, Lord Cromer, 
intervened after Abbas Hilmi II  had replaced  his prime-minister and, though the French 
government demanded the Khedive’s independence,  forced the viceroy to discard the first 
candidate and appoint another person in his stead. This move  strengthened British dominion 
over Egypt. 
126. The Triple Alliance —a military and political bloc of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy 
against France and Russia. This alliance took its final shape in 1882 after Italy had acceded 
to the Austro-German military alliance concl uded in 1879. The Triple Alliance Treaty was 
signed for a term of five years; it was pr olonged in 1887 and 1891 and then automatically 
extended (in 1902 and in 1912). The Triple Alliance set the stage for division of Europe into 
two major groups of states hostile to one anot her and ultimately led to the World War of 
1914-18. 
127. Engels refers to the outcome of the Russo -Turkish War of 1877-78 sealed by the decisions 
of the Berlin International Congress (13 June  - 13 July 1878) which involved representatives 
of Russia, Britain, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Germany as well as France and Italy. The 
Congress made significant changes in the term s of the preliminary San Stefano Peace Treaty 
(of 3 March 1878) between Russia and Turkey which fortified Russia’s positions in the 
Balkans. 
128. Engels means the sp eech of Franz Tutzauer, a Social-D emocrat, in the Reichstag on 21 
January 1893 during the first reading of the dr aft law on enterprises selling their merchan-
dise on an instalment plan (the text of  the speech was published by the newspaper Vorwärts 
on 22 January 1893). The speaker, who owned a small furniture-dealing shop, defended the 
rights of shop owners; in particular, their right to recover debts from defaulters, the working 
people as a rule. 
129. Die Jungen (The Young Ones)—a semi-anarchist  opposition group in German Social-
Democracy formed in the spring and summer of 1890. It was led by former university 
students: young literati and editors of party news papers (hence the name), as well as trade-
union and party leaders from local organisations. The oppositi on drew support from Social-
Democratic Party members among industrial workers and craftsmen. The leaders of the 
Young Ones were Paul Ernst, Paul Kamp ffmeyer, Hans Müller, Bruno Wille, Wilhelm 
Werner, Carl Wildberger and others. Ignori ng the new realities obtained for the Party’s 
activity with the abrogation of the Anti-So cialist Law (see Note 15), the Young Ones 
opposed the Party’s parliamentary activities as  not radical enough and were making dema-
gogic attacks on the Party and its Executive Board {der Vorstand); thus, they accused it of 
political corruption, opportunism and violation of the Party democracy. In October 1891 the 
leaders of the Young Ones were expelled from the Party. 
130. In his letter to Engels on 5 January 1893 K. Kautsky said he was going to write a detailed 
biography of Karl Marx for the forthcoming te nth anniversary of Marx’s death. He was to 
proceed from the materials at his disposal—the  article of Engels ‘Karl Marx’ (see present 
edition, Vol. 24, pp. 183-95; pp. 463-81), W Lie bknechts article about Karl Marx and G. 
=====第587页=====
Notes 561 
Gross’ book Karl Marx (Liepzig, 1885); Kautsky asked Enge ls for advice about additonal 
materials for the biography. Evidently Kautsky was unable to carry out the work.  
131. In this letter, dated 5 January 1893, Ka utsky approached Eleanor Marx-Aveling through 
Engels with a request to write reminiscences about Marx for the journal Die Neue Zeit. This 
request was apparently not granted. 
132. In his letter to Engels on 5 January 1893 K. Kautsky enclosed a Rio de Janeiro-published 
newspaper with an article on the Brazilian Work ers’ Party and its programme; the name of 
this newspaper has not been determined. 
133. The wherea bouts of the cable is unkown. 
134. Applying the German word ‘Gründungen to Menotti Garibaldi, Engels hints at his entre-
preneurial activities in the early 1870s. Grundertum, a period of ‘prosperity’ in Germany in 
1871-73. It was made possible to a large extent by the war reparations of five thousand mil-
lion francs and the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine under the terms of the Frankfurt Peace 
Treaty (1871) which concluded the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. 
135. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard to the following address penned with his own hand: 
Sig. Filippo Turati, Portici Galleria V.E. 23, Milano, Italy. 
136. Engels means The Socialist League’s programme document— The Manifesto of the Socialist 
League (see The Commonweal No. 1, February 1885). This organisation was founded in 
Britain in December 1885 by a group of Socialis ts who had left the Social Democratic 
Federation (see Note 44). The Manifesto proclaimed in part that its members ‘... seek a 
change in the basis of Society... which would destroy the distinction of classes and nation-
alities’. The Socialist League pursued the following objectives: setting up a national and 
international socialist party; gaining political power by electing Socialists to local govern-
ment bodies; assisting the trade-union and cooperative movements. In the inital years of its 
existence the League was actively involved in the working-class movement, However, after 
1887 its leadership split into several factions, and there surfaced strong sectarian tendencies, 
with many members leaving the ranks. In 1895 th e Socialist League actually ceased to exist. 
137. The Gazeta Robotnicza, which Maria Mendelson sent to Engels, carried a statement of 
Polish Social-Democrats about Marcin Kasprzak’s expulsion from the Party for the embez-
zlement of Party funds, abuse of trust and susp icious links with the police. Besides, the 
newspaper published a statement of Berlin So cialists who urged breaking off ties with 
Kasprzak. Subsequently Marcin Kasprzak proved the slanderous  nature of such accusations 
and took an active part in the revolutionary movement. In 1905 the Central Committee of the 
Polish Social-Democratic Party adopted an offi cial decision clearing him from imputation. 
138. In her letter to Engels on 5 February 1893 Maria Mendelson spoke about the anti-Semitic 
and anti-Polish sentiments among Russian univers ity students and army officers in Moscow 
and St. Petersburg. 
139. An abridged version of this letter was fi rst published in English in the book: Marx, K., 
Engels, F., Letters on ‘Capital’. London: New Park Publications, 1983. 
140. Vladimir Shmuilov, a Russian émigré and Soci alist, told Engels in his letter of 4 February 
1893 that acting on the request of Pavlenkov, the St. Petersburg publisher of the series 
Biographies of Illustrious Men, he intended to write a detailed biography of K. Marx, from 6 
to 8 signatures large. Shmuilov asked Engels for assitance in collecting materials on three

562 Notes 
subjects: 1) biography proper,  2) the practical activities of Marx, specifically, in 1847-49 
and in the period of the First International, and 3) the genesis of Marxism. Shmuilov asked 
Engels to send him a copy of The Holy Family, written jointly by Marx  and Engels, or reca-
pitulate its substance and send excerpts from its mo st essential parts. Shmuilov said that if he 
did not succeed in having this book published in Russia, he would have it printed abroad. 
However, Shmuilov apparently did not succeed in his undertaking.  
141. Beginning with 1845 Marx and Engels propagated th eir views among German workmen 
resident in Brussels. For this purpose they set up a German Workers’ Society in August 
1847, where Marx read his lecture on political economy ( Wage Labour and Capital, see 
present edition, Vol. 9, pp.  197-228). The Society remained active until the Revolution 
of 1848.  
The Communist League —the first German and interna tional communist organisation of 
the proletariat formed under the leadership of  Marx and Engels in London early in June 
1847. Concerning the history of this organisation,  see Engels’ article ‘On the History of the 
Communist League’ (present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 312-330).  
142. Marx undertook his first systematic study into the surplus value problem in his MS of 1857-
58: Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie (Rohentwurf) which consituted the 
basis of the 1859-published A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (first 
instalment). His further studies in this fiel d are contained in the 1861-63 MS conceived as a 
second instalment of the Outlines (see present edition, vols. 28-29 and 30-34). 
143. In the course of the Reichstag delibera tions in late January 1893 on the state budget for 
1893-94, the bourgeois depu ties hurled accusation at the Social-D emocrats to the effect that 
they allegedly wanted no more than foment popular discontent but were unable to say how 
they envisioned a socialist state of the futu re. Responding in his two parliamentary speeches 
on 3 and 6 February 1893, August Bebel laid dow n the fundamental socialist principles. He 
sought to capitalise on the widespread disc ontent and the inability of the imperial 
government to combat the gathering economic de pression. For several days this issue was 
the subject of debates in the Reichstag, an  occasion which the Social-Democratic deputies 
used to articulate their ideas. Speaking on 7 Fe bruary, A. Stoecker, representing the Right 
Wing, said that after W. Liebknechts speech  he would make no statement as he had 
originally intended and suggested that the debates be terminated. The discussion ended 
therewith. 
144. Speaking in the Reichstag on 4 February 1893, w ith a critique of the Centrist Catholic Party, 
K. Frohme, a Social-Democratic deputy, cited the medieval scholastic philosopher Thomas 
Aquinas so as to prove that the Church had always encouraged serfdom. In his reply speech 
F. Hitze, a deputy representing the Centre Part y, said the quoted passage did not belong to 
Thomas Aquinas but was taken from Aristotle’s treatise Politics to which Thomas Aquinas 
had written a commentary. 
145. The personages from the pamphlet of E. Ri chter, the leader of the German Party of’Free-
Thinkers’: Sozialdemokratische Zukunftsbilder. Frei nach Bebel, Berlin 1891. This lampoon 
was directed against German Social-Democracy. 
146. Writing to Engels on 31 January 1893, A. Bebe l suggested that tsarist Russia, by entering 
into an alliance with France, pursued the aim of a joint wa r against Germany without, how-
ever, involving other European states and Turkey into it. In the case of Germany’s defeat, he 
said, France would obtain the left bank of th e Rhine, while Russia would be able to 
consolidate its influe nce in the Balkans.

147. The reference is to the annexation by Prussia after its victory in the war against Austria 
(1866), of the Hesse-Cassel (Kurhesse) Kurfürsten tum which had sided with Austria. In that 
war, Prussia annexed other lands as well. 
148. In the Ba ttle of Spichern (Lorraine), one of the first ma jor engagements in the Franco-
Prussian War of 1870-71, Prussi an troops defeated French fo rces. This battle was fought on 
6 August 1870. 
149. The German Party of Free Thinkers (Die Deutsche Freisinnige Partei) was formed in 1884 
with the merger of the progressist Fortschrittspartei and the National-Liberal Left Wing. 
One of the Freisinniges leaders was Eugen Ri chter, a Reichstag deputy. Expressing the 
interests of the petty and middle bourgeoisie,  the Party was in opposition to the Bismarck 
government. In 1893 the Party split in to two factions (see Note 223). 
150. Below Engels cites the (German) translation of the article ‘Lomza janvier 1893’ (from the 
French) which appeared in the Fe bruary issue of the newspaper Przedswit of the Polish 
Socialist Party, in its feature Z Kraju i o Kraju; the original heading of  the article was ‘Z 
Lomzynskiego w Styczniu 1893, Russo-Boruska przujazn’. 
151. The amendment that censured the government for taking no steps to alleviate the plight of 
the jobless was rejected by 276 votes against 109. A detailed analysis of the programme of 
the Gladstone cabinet in the context of this  amendment was published by Eduard Bernstein 
in the newspaper Vorwärts, No. 35, on 10 February 1893. 
152. In a reference to Liberal Radicals, Engels meant the Radicals within the Left Wing of the 
Liberal Party who represented broad strata of the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie, 
bourgeois intellectuals and the trades-union lead ership. In Britain the Radicals did not make 
up an organisation in its own right. 
153. The constituent conference of the Indepe ndent Labour Party held  in Bradford on 13-14 
January 1893. Keir Hardie, who chaired at this conference, played the chief role in founding 
the Party and in its leadership (see note 114). 
154. About the origin of the sobriquet Panamites, see Note 60. 
155. Engels intimates that since the beginning of  the debates in the Fren ch Chamber of Deputies 
on the Panama scandal (see Note 60) the Socialists have not spoken on the issue. 
156. The forthcoming elections in August a nd September 1893 to the French Chamber of 
Deputies (see Note 208) housed in the Bour bon Palace in Quai d’Orsay in Paris. 
157. On 11 February 1893 the British newspaper The Daily News published the article of its Paris 
correspondent Emily Crawford: ‘The Sentence on the Panama Directors. Sympathy for Mr. 
de Lesseps’. 
The French government had to bring to trial some of the men implicated in the Panama 
scandal (see Note 60). On 9 February 1893, the court found Ferdinand-Marie Lesseps, the 
88-year-old head of the comp any, guilty, and his son Charle s Lesseps, together with the 
other defendants, Fontacem Cottu and Fiffel. F.  Lesseps and Ch. Lesseps were sentenced to 
5 years in prison and a fine of  3,000 francs each, while the ot her defendants received 2 years 
in jail and fines. However, on 15 June 1893 the Court of Cassation reversed the sentence and 
acquitted the defendants of all the charges. Yet Ch. Lesseps had to remain in custody 
pending the payment of the fine imposed on him.  
158. A. Bebel’s sp eech in the Reichstag on 3 February 1893 (abridged) as well as excerpts from 
W. Liebknechts speech on 7 February 1893 (see Note 143) were published by the newspa 
per Le Socialiste (No. 126) on 19 February 1893.

159. A reference to deliberations in the Germ an Reichstag in mid-January 1893 in connection 
with inquiry of the Social-Democratic  parliamentary group on 31 December 1892 con-
cerning the dire economic situation in the count ry, a sequel to the world economic crisis of 
the early 1890s. This crisis caused a fresh upsurge in strike action in 1892 and 1893. 
160. The work Can Europe Disarm? was inspired by A. Bebel’s letter to Engels of 11 February 
1893 with a request to air his views as to wh at stand the Social-Democratic group in the 
Reichstag was to take on the draft military law tabled by the government (see Note 76). 
Having done so, Engels sent the MS to Ber lin on 23 February 1893; in keeping with his 
wishes, the work was published in the newspaper Vorwärts in eight instalments (on 1-5, 7,9 
and 10 March 1893). Late in March 1893 it came out  in a separate edition to which Engels 
wrote a preface. 
161. On 18 February 1893 the newspaper Workman’s Times (No. 144), in its section 
International Working-Class Movement, published a review of the debates in the German 
Reichstag on a state of the future (see this volume, pp. 99-100). 
162. In the parliamentary elections in the summe r of 1892 the Socialist organisations nominated a 
considerable number of indepe ndent candidates; of these, three—Keir Hardie, John Burns 
and John Havelock Wilson—were elected as MPs. 
At the House of Commons on 20 February 1893,  a First Reading was given to two Bills 
dealing with modifications of the electoral la w. Amongst other things they contemplated the 
abolition of all property qualifications; the intr oduction of returning o fficers, nominated and 
paid by municipal councils, to be responsible for drawing up the electoral register; and the 
establishment of a single register of voters for all elections (parliamentary, municipal, etc.). 
This draft legislation was turned down by the House of Lords.  
163. The Parish Councils Bill was  tabled in Parliament by the Gladstone cabinet in 1893 and 
approved on 1 March 1894. The entire system of  local self-government was reorganised 
with this Bill. The Parish councils, which had been performing the func tions of church and 
secular government in rural districts, now reta ined their prerogatives only in ecclesiastical 
affairs, while secular government was turned ove r to Parish Assemblies elected by local tax-
payers. In larger rural comm unities such assemblies elected Parish Councils from their 
midst.

F. Correspondence 1846-1895. A Selecti on with Commentary and Notes. Translated and 
edited by Dona Torr. Martin Lawrence (1934). 
The envelope of this letter has the followi ng address which Engels wrote with his own 
hand: Monsieur N.F Danielson, 8 gra nde rue de Ecuries, logis No. 7, Saint-Petersbourg, 
Russia.  
165. See the letters which Engels wrote to Danielson on 29-31 October 1891, and on 15 March, 
18 June and 22 September 1892 (present ed ition, Vol. 49, pp.  278, 382, 440, 535). 
166. Engels alludes to Russia’s defeat in the Crimean War of 1853-56. 
167. Engels alludes to a pseudonym used duri ng his correspondence with N. Danielson in the 
1880s and in 1891-92; Engels used the surnam e of the husband of his wife’s niece—Percy 
White Rocher. 
168. On 16 February 1893, in the Panama case debates (see Note 60), P. Lafargue spoke in the 
Chamber of Deputies; his speech was published by the newspaper Le Socialiste (No. 126) on 
19 February 1893. In his letter to Engels on 23 Fe bruary, Lafargue said that all the bourgeois 
newspapers had ignored that speech.

169. In his letter to Engels on 23 February 1893 Lafa rgue wrote in part that the French Workers’ 
Party (see Note 11) and the Radical Socialists  (the Radical Left Wing, see Note 86), who 
were led by Etienne Millerand and Jean Jaur és, had agreed on cooperation in the August-
September 1893 elections to the Chamber of De puties and that they planned to launch an 
agitation campaign in Northern France on 5 March. 
170. At the municipal elections of 1 and 8 May 1892 the French Workers’ Party polled over 
100,000 votes, with 635 Socialists being elected to  municipal bodies. They gained a majority 
in the local councils of 26 cities. 
171. Home Rule —the demand for Irish self-government w ithin the British Empire, as put forward 
by the Irish liberal bourgeoisie in the 1870s. Ho me Rule provided for an independent Irish 
parliament and national bodies  of government. However, the British government was to 
retain the key positions in Ireland. 
172. The conference held by representatives of Eu ropean socialist parties in preparation for the 
forthcoming Third International Socialist Working-Men’s Congress in Zurich (see Note 
229). At the initiative of the Organizing Comm ittee (see Note 27) this conference met in 
Brussels on 26 March 1893; it involved representa tives of 6 European countries. Its deci-
sions urged the delegates of th e forthcoming Congress to recogni se the need of the political 
struggle of the working class. One of the aims of  this demand was to keep the Anarchists from 
taking part in the Congress.

T.3. (1891-1895), Paris, Ed. Sociales, 1959.  
174. The full text of this letter is in reply to the inquiry of the London firm Thomas Cook & Son 
which asked Engels for a letter of recommendati on for L. Freyberger who wanted to open an 
account with this firm. 
175. Engels was taking a rest at Eastbourne from March 1 to March 17 1893 or thereabouts. 
176. This letter was written on a postcard with  the following address penned by Engels: W. 
Liebknecht Esq., 160, Kantstrasse, Charlottenburg-Berlin, Germany. 
177. This letter was written on a postcard, with th e address inscribed by E ngels: Sigr. avv. Filippo 
Turati, Portici Galleria V.E. 23, Milano, Italy. 
178. On 7 March 1893 F. Turati sent the proofs of the Italian translation of The Manifesto of the 
Communist Party (see Note 108) and asked Engels to return them as soon as possible, for it 
was to be published the following week. Turati did not succeed in his plans to include the 
programme documents of the International in the supplement, as had been done in the 1882 
Russian edition of the Manifesto.  
Of the two brochures mentioned in the text, the name of only one has been determined: 
Pasquale di Fratta, La socializzazione della terra, Milano, 1893.  
179. This letter was first published in English in full in: Science and Society, N.Y., 1938. Vol. 11, 
No. 3. 
180. The rough notes of this letter jotted down by Engels are extant, together with the copy he 
made for F. Sorge; Engels sent it to Sorge with his letter of 18 March 1893 (see this volume, 
pp. 124-126). The different reading of the copy co mpared with the original is marked in the 
footnotes. As is clear from these three documents , the letter is indicated to have been written 
in London, though at that time Engels was recuperating in Eastbourne (see Note 175).

Engels wrote the following address on the envelope: Mr. F. Wiesen, Baird, Texas, U.S. 
America.  
181. The Bloomsbury Socialist Society, which sprung from the Bloomsbury Branch of the Socialist 
League (see Notes 44, 136), became an inde pendent organisation in August 1888, soon 
after the Bloomsbury branch had left the Lea gue. In its activities the Society was guided by 
E. Marx-Aveling, E. Aveling, John L. Ma hon, James Macdonald, among others.Taking an 
active part in its work were such veterans of  the working-class movement as F. Lessner and 
A. Weiler. The Society received si gnificant support from F. Engels.  
The Bloomsbury Socialist society proclaimed as  its aim the propaganda of socialist ideas 
amongst the working class and the struggle for a worker political organisation. In subse-
quent years it often organised meetings to commemorate the epic days of the Paris 
Commune of 1871; it also arranged lectures on va rious topics related to acute social and 
political issues. Its members were doing activ e propaganda work in other Socialist and 
Radical clubs and societies, as well as in ‘new trades unions’.  
182. The International Socialist Working-Men’s Congress, in session in Brussels in August 1891 
(see Note 228), entrusted the convocation of th e next congress to Swiss Social-Democrats 
who set up an Organising Committee in Zurich (see Note 27), with Robert Seidel as 
secretary. 
183. Bebel was visiting Engels in London fr om 28 March to 4 April 1893 or thereabouts. 
184. The full text of this letter in Englis h was first published in Marx K., Engels F., Letters to 
Americans. 1848-1895- A Selection. New York, International Publishers, 1953. 
185. In his letters to Engels on 3 February and 9 March 1893 H.D. Lloyd, an American journalist 
and the author of books on social issues, aske d him to take part in worker congresses 
scheduled for late August-early September 1893 in Chicago during an international exhi-
bition that was to be held to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of America’s 
discovery. Lloyd requested that Engels read lectures on the following two subjects: ‘The 
Working-Class Movement in Britain from a Socialist Standpoint’ and ‘International Labour 
Congresses’, and also speak on other related topics at his discretion. 
186. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: The Labour Monthly, L., 1934, 
No. 12; the full text in  English appeared in: Science and Society, N.Y., 1938, Vol. 11, No. 3. 
187. A reference to the tug of war in the United States between the a dvocates of bimetallism and 
those of a single gold standard. In 1890, under th e Sherman Silver Purchase Act, the West’s 
demands for more and more coinage of the me tal were heeded. But as predicted, gold was 
hoarded and driven out of circ ulation, and the silver-to-gol d ration became 26.5 : 1 in 1893. 
In the summer of that year, under President Cleveland’s Administration, Congress had to 
repeal the Sherman Act to keep gold from va nishing altogether. By the end of the 19th 
century gold was fully restored as a single cu rrency standard in the United States. Engels 
gave his assessment of these developments in his letter to Sorge of 2 December 1893 (see this 
volume, pp. 235-36). 
188. In a letter sent to Engels on 18 March 1893 August Radimsky said that the editor of the 
Delnické Listy, the organ of the Czech Workers’ Party,  which appeared in Austria, intended 
to publish The Manifesto of the Communist Party, translated into C zech, in a separate 
edition. Yet fearing a possible confiscation of  the booklet by the authorities, the editor pub-
lished the Manifesto (in instalments), as a series of articles in the above newspaper. Radimsky 
had sent the initial numbers of the newspape r and asked if Engels wanted the rest.

189. From 1 A ugust to 29 September 1893 Engels made a tour of Germany, Switzerland and 
Austria-Hungary; he visited Cologne and then, t ogether with A. Bebel, went to Zurich via 
Mainz and Strassburg; thence he went to the Canton of Graubünden for several days to meet 
his brother Hermann. Upon his return to Zu rich on 12 August, Engels attended the final 
session of the International Socialist Working-Men’s Congress in Zurich (see Note 229), 
where he made a short speech in English, Fren ch and German (see present edi-tion,Vol. 27, 
pp. 404-05) and, on behalf of the Bureau, closed  the session. After a fortnight’s sojourn in 
Switzerland, Engels left for Vienna thr ough Munich and Salzburg; in Vienna, on 14 
September, he addressed a meeting of Soci al-Democrats (see present edition, Vol. 27, 
pp.406-07). Then, via Prague and Karlsbad (Karl ovy Vary), he went to Berlin and stayed 
there from 16 September to 28 September; on 22 September he spoke at a Social-Democratic 
meeting (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 409-10). Thereupon Engels returned to London by 
way of Rotterdam. 
190. Bank holiday —in Great Britain, any of six legal holidays on which banks are closed. 
Introduced in 1871, bank holiday is celebrated on Monday as a rule: after Easter Sunday, 
after Whitsunday, and on the first Monday in August; also all banks are closed on 26 
December. 
191. Engels wrote the draft of his reply on an empty page of M.R. Cotar’s letter of 21 March 
1893. Cotar asked for permission to translate Volume II  of Das Kapital into French and 
requested assistance in this undertaking. 
192. On the envelope of this letter Engels wrote the following address: G.W. Lamplugh Esq., 
Ballafurt, Port Erin, Isle of Man.

193. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: Marx K., Engels F., On 
Literature and Art, Moscow, Progress Publishers, 1976. 
194. This part of Engels’ letter of 28 Septembe r 1892 to Franz Mehring (see present edition, Vol. 
49) was published in Mehring’s article ‘II ber den historischen Materialismus’ appended to 
the first separate edition of his work: Die Lessing-Legende. Eine Re ttung von Franz Mehring, 
Stuttgart, 1893. Engels also mentions the book by Lavergne-Peguilhen: Grundzüge der 
Gesellschaftswissenschaft. Erster Theil. Die Bewegungs-und Productionsgesetze, First Part. 
Königsberg, 1838. 
195. A reference to the publication of Engels’ work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and 
the State translated into French by Henri Ravé; this translation was edited by Laura Lafargue 
who did a stupendous amount of work to correct the numerous deficiencies contained in it. 
Having read the thus revised translation, E ngels had a high opinion of the work done. The 
book was published in October 1893 under the title L’Origine de la famille, de la propriété 
privée et de l’état.  
196. On 30 April 1892, L’Illustration published two pages of the por traits of personalities promi-
nent in the international socialist movement. 
197. Engels means The Legal Eight Hours and In ternational Labour League founded in 1890 by a 
group of English Socialists with Engels’ pa rticipation on the basis of a Committee which 
had organised Britain’s first ever May Day demonstration in London in 1890. The League 
set as its aim the struggle for the liberation of  the working class and action on the decisions 
of the Paris Congress of the Second Intern ational (see Note 227). In 1893 League repre-
sentatives took part in setting up The Independent Labour Party (see Note 114).

568 Notes 
London Trades Council was established at a conference of delegates representing London’s 
trades-unions (May 1860). Among its members were the leaders of major trades-unions and 
men from the so-called worker aristocracy. In  the early 1860s the Council led the action of 
the British workers against interv ention in the American Civil Wa r, in defence of Poland and 
Italy, and later, for legalisation of trades -unions. Early in the 1890s the Council, which 
embraced predominantly the old trades-unions , took a negative stand on the movement for 
new trades-unions and for the legal eight hours. Yet the mass character of this movement 
compelled the Council to join in the May demonstrations of the 1890s.  
198. The Hull dockers went on strike on 8 April 1893. This strike, which continued until 19 May, 
was caused by the decision of the Shipowners’ Federation to give employment preferences 
to non-unionised job-seekers. Thousands of st rikebreakers were brought to Hull under armed 
force protection. Two gunboats  entered the port. Hull b ecame an arena of fierce 
confrontation and looked like a military camp a ll through the strike action. Even though the 
strike drew support from miners, railwaymen and other trades-unions, the dockers did not 
succeed in winning a victory. The conflict ended in an agreement which both sides reached 
in keeping with the reciprocal freedom principle. 
199. Concerning the publication of Carl Schorle mmer’s literary heritage; he died on 27 June 
1892. Ludwig Siebold and Philipp Kl epsch took charge of this j ob as the executors of Carl 
Schorlemmer’s will. 
200. Adolf Spiegel, manager of a paraffin-making factory, wrote a brief biography of Carl 
Schorlemmer and had it published in the journal Berichten der Deutschen Chemischen 
Gesellschaft, Jg. 25, Bd. II I, 1892. 
201. In his letter of 28 April 1893 E Sorge asked Engels if Abraham Lincoln had replied to a 
message of greetings sent to him in 1864 by  the General Council of the International 
Working-Men’s Association on the occasion of his election for a second term as President of 
the United States (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 19-21). This message, which Marx had 
written late in November 1864, was sent to Lincoln through the American Ambassador in 
London, Charles Francis Adams.  On 28 January 1865 the General Council received a reply 
sent on Lincoln’s behalf which was read out at  the Council’s meeting of January 31 and then 
published by The Times (No. 25101) on 6 February 1865, under the heading: ‘Mr. Lincoln 
and the International Working-Men’s Association’. 
202. Conservatives —a political party expressing the interest s of the Prussian Junkers, army cir-
cles, top bureaucracy and Luther an clergy. With the formati on of the North German Union 
and in the initial years of the German Empire , the Conservatives made a strong right-wing 
opposition to the Bismarck government; they  came out against bourgeois reforms and 
broader powers conceded to the Reich author ities. In 1866 there was a split in their ranks 
which gave rise to the Free Conservative Party {Die Freikonservative Partei, or Reichspartei) 
representing the interests of big landed propr ietors and of a segment of the industrial 
magnates. The Free Conservatives took a stand of unequivocal support for the Bismarck 
government. 
In 1876 the Conservatives made common cause with other right-wing groups and formed 
a German Conservative Party {Die Deutschkonservative Partei) which continued up to the 
year 1918.  
203. National Liberals —a Prussian (and from 1871, an a ll-German) bourgeois political party 
active between 1867 and 1918 as a bulwark of th e Junkers and industrial magnates. This 
party expressed the interests of a larger pa rt of the big industrial and commercial bour 
geoisie, and also of the financiers—the stra ta that supported the domestic and foreign pol-

icy steered by Bismarck and by subsequent reactionary governments of the German Empire. 
In the early 1890s the National Liberals came forward with the idea of ‘suspending’ any 
kind of social legislation and mounted a cr usade for unrestricted entrepreneurial powers.  
204. At the Reichstag election of 15 June 1893 th e German Social-Democrats gained a major 
victory: they polled 1,787,000 votes. All in all,  44 Social-Democratic deputies were elected 
to the Reichstag, among them, W. Liebknecht, A. Bebel and P. Singer. Of the six deputies 
elected in Berlin, five were Social-Democra ts. Engels commented on these election returns 
in his interview for a correspondent of Daily Chronicle (see present edition, Vol. 27, p. 549). 
205. During the May Day demonstration held in London’s Hyde Park on 7 May 1893, the Legal 
Eight Hours and International Labour League (see Note 197) organised an international 
rostrum from which socialists of many countries spoke, among them, Alfred Delcluze, 
Louise Kautsky, Friedrich Lessner, Eleanor Marx-Aveling, S.M. Kravchinsky (Stepniak). 
206. Liberal Unionists —a group led by Joseph Chamberlain wh ich, in 1886, broke away from the 
Liberal Party because of the differences ove r Home Rule for Ireland (see Note 171). The 
Liberal Unionists were advocating continue d Union with Ireland (1801). They leagued 
themselves with the Conservative Party a nd, a few years later, joined its ranks. 
207. Hastings—a resort on the English Channel. 
208. At the elections to the French Chamber of Deputies on 20 August and 3 September 1893 the 
Socialists of various trends gained 700,000 votes and 30 seats (among the elected deputies 
12 were from the Workers’ Party—J. Gues de, J. Juarés, E. Vaillant and others). 
The deputies representing the Workers’ Party agreed to form a united socialist group in 
the new Chamber; this group comprised 20 de puties who belonged to the bourgeois Left 
Wing, Radicals for the most part (also known as  ‘independent socialists’) and other social-
ists. All in all the Socialist group in th e Chamber of Deputies numbered 50 deputies.  
Engels more than once criticised the leadersh ip of the Workers’ Pa rty for concessions it 
had made to the Radicals in the matter of Pr ogramme and organisational principles for the 
sake of forming a joint Socialist parliamentary gr oup. See, e.g., Engels’ letters to V. Adler of 
17 July 1894 and to F. Sorge of 30 Decem ber 1893 (see this volume, pp. 249, 324-25).  
209. Hermann Lopatin was imprisoned in the Schlüsselburg fortress at the time. 
210. Together with this book Isaak Hourwich had sent a number of articles on the revolutionary 
movement in Russia and asked Engels what he  thought of them. Hourwich intended to have 
these articles published in The Progress along with Engels’ commentary. 
211. The second edition of Henry Lloyd’s book A Strike of Millionaires against Miners saw print 
in Chicago in 1891 (the first ed ition being published there in 1890). 
This book looks into the history of a major loc kout staged by the owners of Illinois coal 
mines. At the end of 1888 and in early 1889 the company fired a third of its coal miners and 
declared a general lockout; it closed stores  selling foodstuffs on credit. For nearly six 
months about five thousand mine rs were involved in a struggle to defend their rights. Yet 
this standoff ended in a victory of the entr epreneurs who succeeded in imposing the lowest 
pay rates for miners in the United States by slashing the old ones 1/3. The author had twice 
visited the scene and published a number of artic les in the press, urging assistance to the 
jobless coal miners and their families. H.  Lloyd’s book became very popular in the United 
States.  
212. K. Kautsky wrote to Engels in his letter of 19 May 1893 that the journal Die Zeitschrift fur 
Social- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte, Bd.L, Ausgabe I, Freiburg in Breisgau Leipzig, 1893) had 
published the article by Lujo Brentano, a Kath eder Socialist: ‘Die Volksvirtschaft und ihre

konkreten Grundbedingungen’ which perm itted attacks on Engels’ work The Origin of the Family, Private 
Property and the State (see present edition, Vol. 26).  
213. By the old Concordia business Engels means L. Brenta nos articles published anonymously 
by the journal Concordia in 1872 in which he attempted to discredit Marx as a scientist. 
Thus, Brentano accused Marx of incompetence and falsifications; Marx responded by two 
articles in the newspaper Volksstaat. ‘A Reply to the Brentano Article’ and A Reply to 
the Second Brentano Article’ (see present ed ition, Vol. 23, pp. 164-67, 190-97). In 1890, 
continuing his campaign of slander against Marx, L. Brentano published the pamphlet 
Meine Polemik mit Karl Marx which elicited a response from Engels, the pamphlet Marx 
contra Brentano (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 97-154).  
Engels criticised the views of A. Mülberger, a German Proudhonist, in his work The Housing 
Question which he wrote in 1872-73, in Parts I and II I (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 317-391).  
214. Engels hints at the thesis of ‘one reactionary mass’ which entered into the Programme of the German 
Social-Democratic Party adopted at its Gotha Congre ss in 1875. Thus, the Programme said this in part: 
‘Emancipation of labour ought to be the cause of the working class in relation to which all the other 
classes consititute but one reactionary ma ss’. Marx censured this tenet in his Critique of the Gotha 
Programme (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp.75-99). 
215. An allusion to E.B. Bax’s articles ‘Der Fluch der Zivilisation’ and ‘Menschenthum und Klasseninstinkt’ 
published by the journal Die Neue Zeit, 11 Jg. 1892/93, Bd. 2, Nos. 45 & 47; this worked was translated 
from English by V Adler. 
216. In his letter of 31 May 1899 Hermann Bahr, an Austri an journalist, asked Engels to explain his stand on 
anti-Semitism and the Jewish problem ; he intended to have this material, along with the pronouncements 
of other persons on this subject, published in the Vienna newspaper Die Deutsche Zeitung.  
217. By anti-Semitic candidates, Engels means representatives of Die Christlich-soziale Arbeiterpartei (The 
Christian Social Worker Party) founded in 1878 by A dolf Stoecker, a reactionary  German political figure 
and advocate of anti-Semitism. This party saw its aim in combatting the socialist movement; subsequently 
it used the slogan of anti-Semitism to mount a dema gogic campaign against financial capital. Its members 
succeeded in winning support among the backward strata of  the peasantry and artisans in some districts of 
Germany; this success had a part to play in the se tup of the poll. In 1895 A. Stoecker transformed his 
organisation into Die Christlich-soziale Partei.  
About the election to the German Reichstag, see Note 204.  
218. In his letter of June 1893 F. Turati told Engels about  the plans of G. Domanico, an Italian anarchist, to 
publish the Italian translation of Das Kapital, beginning with Vol. 1, in 50 installments at low price; 
writing to Engels on 2 June 1893, G. Domanico expre ssed his confidence that E ngels would approve of 
this initiative and asked for a letter that might be used  as a preface. G. Domanico also asked Engels to 
him know about corrections in the text, remarks and amendments. This undertaking never came off. 
219. About the middle of May 1841 Engels, in his father ’s company, made a tour of southern Germany, 
Switzerland and Northern Italy (Lombardy). See also  his travel notes in Wanderings in Lombardy 
(present edition, Vol. 2, p. 170).

220. As F. Turati wrote to Engels, the Italian So cialist E. Guindani was undertaking the Italian 
edition of G. Déville’s book Le Capital de Karl Marx. Ré sumé et accompagné d’un aperçu 
sur 
le socialisme scientifique. The book was published in Cremona in 1893.  
Engels commented on G. Déville’s work in his letters to K. Kautsky of 9 January and to 
P. Lavrov of 5 February 1884 (s ee present edition, Vol. 47).  
221. On the envelope of this letter Engels in scribed the following address: Monsieur Stojan 
Nokoff, Chemin de la Rosera ie 8, Genève, Switzerland. 
222. Engels made a mistake by identifying tw o different towns. Philippopolis was the Greek 
name of the present Bulgarian city Plovdiv. 
223. On 6 May 1893 there was a split within Die Deutsche Freisinnige Partei (see Note 149) due 
to the differences over the draft military legisl ation tabled by the Bismarck government (see 
Note 76). The pro-government faction of this pa rty in the Reichstag formed an Alliance of 
Free-Thinkers ( Die Freisinnige Vereinigung) led by Ludwig Bamberger; the other faction, 
opposing the higher war budget, starting calli ng itself a Free-Thinking People’s Party {Die 
Freisinnige Volkspartei), with Eugen Richter as its leader. 
224. In his Interview]. Guesde elucidated the principle of internationalism in the working-class 
and socialist movement. It was published by the newspaper Le Figaro on 17 June 1893 
under the heading ‘Les Socialistes et la Patrie’, and also by Le Socialiste (No. 144) on 17 
June 1894. 
225. The reactionary French politicians P. Dé roulède and L. Millevoy e mounted a campaign 
against G. Clemenceau, the lead er of the Radical Party (see Note 86) in June 1893; they 
accused him of links with one of those implicated  in the Panama affair (see Note 60) and of 
his being in the pay of the British governme nt. The monarchist press started printing 
documents stolen from the British embassy  which indicated breach of allegiance on 
Clemenceau’s part. Yet these documents pr oved false upon their promulgation in the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
226. In the spring of 1893 the monarc hist quarters of France, backed  by the anarchists, launched a 
slanderous campaign against the Socialists; th ey branded as anti-patriotic the Socialist 
principle of internationalism. In this connecti on J. Geusde and P. Lafargue organised meet-
ings in towns of northern France on June 17 and 18 at which they read out an appeal to the 
working people of France (‘Le Conseil national du Parti ouvrier aux trav ailleurs de France’). 
The appeal was published inthe newspaper Le Socialiste (No. 144) on 17 June 1893 on 
behalf of the National Council of the French Wo rkers’ Party. Its full text reads as follows: 
TO THE WORKING PEOPLE OF FRANCE  
Comrades!  
In their impotent fury over the onward march of the Workers’ Party our class enemies 
have resorted to the only weapon left in their arsenal, slander. They are distorting our inter-
nationalism the way they have tried to distort our socialism. And albeit those who seek to 
present us as having no Motherland are the selfsame people who, all through this century, 
have been but abetting incursions into Mo therland’s territory and dismemberment, a 
Motherland whom their class gave up to sack  and plunder by the banditry of cosmopolitan 
financiers and whom it had b een exploiting without stopping at bloodshed at Ricamari and 
Fourmi, we, far from permitting them to confus e a collectivist solution to the question with 
anarchy, this mockery of bourgeois individualis m, shall never allow them to translate our 
glorious motto ‘Long Live the International!’ as the preposterous ventriloquy ‘Down with 
France!’  
=====第598页=====
Notes 
No, internationalism means no humiliation of our Moth erland, nor does it mean its immolation. When 
patries came into being, they were the first and essentia l stage toward the unity of humankind, a goal that 
we are pursuing; and internationalism,  begotten by the entire course of th e new civilisation, is likewise an 
essential stage along this path. Just as the French Patrie was taking form not in opposition to various 
provinces which she wrested from the state of de funct antagonism with the aim of bringing them 
together, but in the interests of th eir freedom and prosperity, so the Patrie of humankind—which requires 
social organisation of production, ex changes and science—is not and ca nnot be formed to the detriment 
of the now extant nations, it is formed  for their good and consummate progress.  
He who embarks upon the path of internationalism l eading to an absolute flourishing of humanity does 
not cease to be a patriot just as we , becoming French at the end of the last century, continued to remain 
Provençals, Flemish or Bretons.  
Contrariwise, internationalists may well call themse lves the only patriots because they are only ones 
to be aware to what extent conditions must improve  under which the future and the grandeur of their 
Patrie can and should be secure—in fact, of all the patries who will have turned from antagonistic to 
solid ones.  
By proclaiming ‘Long Live the International!’ th ey proclaim: ‘Long live the France of labour! Long 
live the historic mission of the French proletariat that will be able to liberate itself only by assisting in the 
liberation of the prolet ariat of all countries!’  
French Socialists are patriots also from anothe r standpoint and from other considerations: because 
France was in the past, and she is de stined already now to evolve into one of the most significant factors 
of social advancement, as we understand it.  
So, we want—and we cannot but want—to have a great and strong France capable of defending the 
republic against united monarchies, and also of protec ting her new year of 1789 which is to come against 
the coalition, at least against a possible co alition, of the capitalist states of Europe.  
It is France who by the works of Babeuf, Four ier and Saint-Simon has made a beginning in the 
development of the socialist ideas to which Marx and Engels have imparted  scientific consummation.  
It is France, the country of the first bourgeois re volution, which is the inevitable precursor of a 
proletarian revolution, who became an  epic battlefield of the classes a nd who sacrificed to the cause of 
emancipated labour a countless numbe r of her heroic rebels in Ly on in 1832 and Paris in 1848 and 1871.  
It is France who, in spite of her sons having been butchered in the Versailles massacre, raised in 1889, 
at her immortal Congress in Paris, the banner of  the International—a banner crimson with her own 
blood—and made a beginning in the celebration of May Day; she is the first to have hoisted the red 
banner of the proletariat, marching on toward winning political power, on the town halls seized by means 
of ballots.  
And since her revolutionary past is the earnest of  her socialist future, 23 years ago, as she faced 
danger, the internationalists of Italy, Spain and othe r countries rushed under the tricolor to her rescue, 
while the nascent German Social -Democracy, risking its freedom, did everything to prevent her 
dismemberment, just as  absurd as criminal.  
But this is why we, patriots, do not want a war whic h, be it victorious or not, would equally result in 
unspeakable calamities, leaving in the battlefield milli ons of people and the engines of death they will 
have been armed with.  
We do not want a war which, whatever its outcome, would be but a game of Asiatic cruelty in the 
person of the Russian czar for the exhausted West.  
We want peace, a lasting peace, because it is to our benefit but, is against the domination of the 
capitalists and governments, a domination we are out to destroy—for they can

prolong their despicable and pernicious existen ce only by dividing and exterminating the nations.  
We want peace because the bourgeois order is foredoomed.  
And now that we know that patriotism and interna tionalism, far from excluding one another, are the 
two mutually complimentary forms of human amity, we repeat it loud and clear to the face of our 
calumniators:  
Yes, the French Workers’ Party constitutes one whol e with the German Social-Democracy against the 
German Empire.  
Yes, the French Workers’ Party constitutes one w hole with the Belgian Workers’ Party against the 
bourgeois Koburg monarchy.  
Yes, the French Workers’ Party constitutes one whole with the toilers and Socialists of Italy against 
the Savoy monarchy.  
Yes, the French Workers’ Party constitutes one whole with the young but already so strong Labour 
Party on the other side of the Channel against the oligarchic and capitalist c onstitutionalism of Britain.  
Yes, we do and shall constitute one whole with the proletariat of both hemispheres against the ruling 
and propertied classes everywhere.  
And we hope that our French comrades, the people of  the workshops and fields, will join their voices 
to the Party National Council in a double call whic h, in substance, constitutes but one whole:  
Long Live the International!  
Long Live France!  
National Council:  
Joseph Crepin, Simon Dereure, Ferroul, deputy;  
Jules Geusde, Paul Lafargue, deputy;  
Prévost, Kennel.  
227. The International Socialist Work ing-Men’s Congress in Paris, which was actually the constituent 
congress of the Second Internati onal, opened on 14 July 1889, the centennial of the storming of the 
Bastille. About 400 delegates from 20 c ountries of Europe and America attended. The Congress heard the 
reports of Socialist representatives  on the condition of the working-class movement in their respective 
countries, outlined fundamental principles of the in ternational labour legisla tion by approving demands 
for the legal eight hours, prohibition of child labour  and for labour protection of working women and 
adolescents. The Congress stressed the need of a political  organisation of the prol etariat and of a struggle 
for the implementation of workers’ democratic dema nds; it spoke out for a dissolution of regular armies 
which were to be replaced by a people’s militia. Th e most significant decision of the Congress was its 
resolution on holding demonstrations and meetings in  all countries on 1 May 1890 in support of an eight-
hour working day and of a fair-labour code. The an archists, who opposed the congress resolutions, failed 
to enlist support from the absolute  majority of the delegates. 
228. The International Socialist Working-Men’s Congr ess in Brussels was held on 16-22 August 1891. It was 
attended by 370 delegates from 16 Eur opean countries and the United States who represented, by and 
large, the Marxist trend in the working-class moveme nt. Most of the delegates voted against anarchists 
participating in the Congress (w ho had sent their delegates). A ttending the Congress were also 
representatives of the British trades unions, a rather positive factor according to Engels. Such issues were 
on its agenda as the labour code, work stoppage a nd boycott, and militarism. In its resolution on labour 
legislation the Congress called on work ers of the world to join forces in the struggle against the capitalist 
rule; it urged workers, wherever they had politi cal rights, to use thes e rights for their eman-

574 Notes 
cipation from wage servitude. The resolu tion on work stoppage and boycott recommended 
that workmen use both forms of the struggle. It emphasised the absolute need of trade 
unions for the workers.  
The attitude of the working class to militari sm was the central issue on the agenda. The 
reports delivered by W. Liebknecht and E. Va illant, as well as the resolution proposed by 
Liebknecht characterized militarism as an inev itable follow-up of the capitalist system; they 
stressed that a socialist system alone would be able to put an end to militarism and establish 
peace among the nations; that Socialists were a genuine party of peace. Yet these documents 
did not define specific tasks and ways of the struggle against the war threat.  
The resolution proposed by Liebknecht was attack ed by the leader of the Dutch Socialists 
D. Nieuwenhuis, a man of anarchist leanings. He  tabled a resolution urging the Socialists of 
all countries to appeal in the event of a war to  their peoples to stage a general strike, but it 
failed to win support among the delegates. The overwhelming majority of votes was cast for 
the W. Liebknecht resolution (see also F. Engels ‘The Brussels Congress. The Situation in 
Europe’; present edition, vol. 27).  
229. The Third International Socialist Working-Men’s Congress was held in Zurich on 6-12 August 
1893. Attending were over 400 de legates from 18 countries. The British delegation had a 
much broader representation than at the previ ous two congresses. The following issues were 
on the agenda: the legal eight hours, May Day celebration, the political tactics of Social- 
Democrats and the position of Social-Democracy in the event of a war.  Since participation 
in the Congress was conditional on one’s rec ognition of political activity (something that 
the anarchists denied), the Congress began its  work by considering the legitimacy of the 
mandates of the anarchist delegates. Following a heated debate a resolution was carried by 
a majority of votes. It interpreted the notion of  political activity as the use of political rights 
and law-making institutions by wo rking-class parties in the inte rests of the proletariat and 
for gaining political power. Upon the adoption of this amendment the anarchists, includ 
ing the representatives of The Young (see Note 129), had to leave the Congress.  
On the issue of May Day festivities the Congre ss rejected by a majority of votes the pro-
posal of the German Social-Democrats to have the celebrations as late as the first Sunday of 
the month; it stressed the major political significance of a demonstration on May 1 as the 
day of proletarian solidarity. On the third issue of the agenda (t he political tactics of Social-
Democrats) the Congress adopted a resolution which recognised the need of combining the 
parliamentary and non-pa rliamentary forms of struggle de pending on specific conditions in 
this or that country.  
Concerning the attitude of Social-Democrats  to war, the Congress turned down the 
Nieuwenhuis proposal for a general strike to be declared in case of a war and reaffirmed the 
basic provisions of the Brussels Congress reso lution on this issue (see Note 228); it added a 
clause urging workers to wage a disarmament struggle and obliging the Socialist MPs to 
vote against war credits.  
230. The Belgian Workers’ Party was founded in Brussels on 5 April 1885 on the basis of the 
Belgian Socialist Party formed in 1879. The Workers’ Party likewise comprised other work-
ers’ organisations—trade unions, cooperatives , etc. The Party crusaded for economic 
demands of the working class and for universal  suffrage; it led the strike action of the 
proletariat. 
231. Charles Verecque, a French Socialist, was se ntenced to a term in prison and public penance 
according to Article 226 of the Fr ench Criminal Code which ha d been in abeyance for about 
100 years. With the consent of a group of Soci alists of the town of Amiens, Verecque 
(accused of saying to the prosecuting attorney , ‘One ought to stick Mr. Viviani s plea onto 
the prosecutor’s back’) wrote a letter to the prosecuting attorney which concluded by

saying: ‘I plead guilty and declare it in a writte n deposition, as it ensu es from Article 226, 
that I am guilty of momentarily mistaking the b ack of a magistrate fo r one of the machines 
on which, in a few weeks’ time, we shall have the honour of sticking the programme—a 
victorious programme—of Socialism’; Verecque ’s statement contained a pun: magistrate 
(‘magistrat’) as a justice and as a municipal officer.  
232. in his letter of 28 June 1893 P. Lafargue told  Engels that the National Council of the French 
Workers’ Party had appealed to the Organi sing Committee of the Zurich International 
Congress (see Note 182) with a request to ad journ the convocation of the Congress from 
August to November in view of the electi on to the Chamber of Deputies due on 20 August 
1893. Lafargue asked Engels to write to Bebe l to get the Germans to second this request. 
233. Engels visited Como during his tour of  Germany, Switzerland and Italy in August-
September 1865. 
234. This letter was first published in English with deletions in: K. Marx and F. Engels,

236. The Duchy of Burgundy, formed in eastern France in th e 9th century, became an inde-
pendent feudal state in the 14th and 15th centu ries; it attained maximum might under Duke 
Charles the Bold in the latter half of the 15th century. In a bid to expand its dominions the 
Duchy of Burgundy worked against the centra list policy of the French King Louis XI and 
waged a war of conquest against the Swiss a nd Lorraine. Finally Louis XI succeeded in 
having the Swiss and Lorrainians form a coa lition against Burgundy. In a war against this 
coalition (1474-77) the troops  of Charles the Bold were def eated, and the Duke was killed in 
the Battle of Nancy (1477). His dominion was divided between Loui s XI and Maximilian 
Habsburg, the German Emperor’s son. 
237. R. Meyer gave a ‘truncated version’ of this  letter for publication; the end of the letter is 
missing. 
238. In his letter of F. Engels of 22 June 1893 R. Meyer recapitula ted a conversation he had with 
a lawyer who, in his political views, was cl ose to the Conservatives (see Note 202). The 
lawyer had told Meyer about the opinion current  among the Conservatives to the effect that 
Reichskanzler Caprivi ‘would use all his pow ers as Chancellor for suppressing Social-
Democracy which had won “too great a victory” in the last election’. 
239. The reference is to Enge ls’ interview to a correspondent of the British newspaper Daily 
Chronicle, published on 1 July 1893. The interview wa s granted on the occasion of the June-
held elections to the German Reichstag and the good returns for German Social-Democrats 
(see Note 204). The text of this intervie w was carried in an abridged form by Le Socialiste 
(No. 148), 15 July 1893, in P. Lafargue’s transl ation and under the heading ‘F. Engels et las 
élections allemandes’ (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 549-53). 
240. The first issue of L’Ere nouvelle on 1 July 1893 carried the final chapter of Engels’ book The 
Origin of Family, Private Property and the State. In light of the Researches by Lewis H. 
Morgan (see present edition, Vol.  26), ‘Barbarism and Civilisation’. The second issue of the 
journal, which came out on 2 August, had chapter V of the above work—’The Emergence of 
the Athenian State’.

241. In 1882-83 France, pushing ahead with the col onialist thrust in Southeast Asia, ran into 
stiff resistance in the Kingdom of Siam. Several military clashes occurred as a result. In July 
1883 French naval ships invested Siam’s capital city, Bangkok. The Siamese government 
had to yield and it signed a treaty with France,  ceding the vassal Siamese territories on the 
left bank of the Mekong to France.  
In 1882 the French government began a coloni al war in North Vietnam (Tongking) which 
developed into a war with China. Although Fran ce established its protectorate over Vietnam, 
the hostilities continued with French troops su ffering setbacks in 1885; this caused the fall 
of the Ferry government.  
242. On the envelope of this letter Engels wr ote the following address: ‘Sigr. Filippo Turati, 
Portici Galleria VE. 23, Milano, Italy’. Turati made this note on the envelope; ‘Engels, 
Proprietà. opere Marx’: the few wo rds that followed are illegible. 
243. The Printing-and-Publishing Union (la Unione  tipografica-editrice) of Turin filed a decla-
ration of protest against the intention of E. Gu indani, an Italian Socialist from Cremona, to 
publish the Italian edition of G. DéVille’s work Le Capital de Karl Marx, Résumé et accom-
pagné d’un aperçu sur le so cialisme scientifique (see note 220); the Union claimed it allegedly 
purchased the copyright on all the works of Marx from his heirs. 
244. On 24 July 1893 Natalie Liebknecht sent E ngels a photograph of the house where he was 
born, in Bruch, a suburb of Barmen. The photograph had been ordered by W. Liebknecht 
during one of his propaga nda tours of Germany. 
245. On 21-28 July 1893 Engels was on holiday in Eastbourne. 
246. In her letter of 24 July 1893 Natalie Liebknecht told Engels that her son Karl had not been 
accepted into military service in Berlin  because of his being a Saxon subject. 
247. A reference to the annexation of the larger part of Alsace and East Lorraine by Germany in 
1871 as a result of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. France 
regained this territory in 1919. 
248. Engels means the rule of the French  Emperor Napoleon II I (2 December 1852— 4 
September 1870). The Second Empire collapsed in  the wake of the September Revolution of 
1870. 
249. In the first round J. Guesde won a victor y by polling 6,887 votes: De schamps, a moderate 
Republican, got 2,138 votes and Vienne, a Roma n Catholic Worker—4,403. Paul Lafargue, 
who had been running in Lisle’s second electoral district, polled 4,745 votes. 
250. Since the International Socialist Working-Me n’s Congress in Zurich was being held on the 
eve of the election to the French Chamber of Deputies, the leaders of  the French Workers’ 
Party were unable to attend. The French de legation comprised 41 men of whom only two 
(Bonnet and Bonnier) represented the Party. The other delegates were from non-Marxist 
parties and political groups: the Possibilists (see Note 30), the Independent Socialists 
(Jaclard), the Blanquists (see Note 20) [Degay and Rémy], etc. The French delegation 
distinguished itself by its inconsistent voting and its opposition to Bebel’s theses and to the 
majority at the Congress. 
251. The text of this letter was written on a post card. Engels indicated his whereabouts: Frau 
Hermann Engels aus Barmen (Engelskirchen), Hotel Bellevue, St. Moritz Bad Engadin.  
252. The hope that Paul Lafargue would be elect ed to the French Chamber of Deputies did not 
materialise. In order to defeat his opponent, Lafargue (as well as Gustave Dron, an oppor-
tunist candidate) had to receive 3,000 votes in his constituency. During the election cam-

paign Lafargue and Dron reached an agreement whereb y Socialists in Dron’s constituency were to cast 
their votes for him, Gustave Dron, while pro-opportuni st candidates in Lafargue’s constituency were to 
vote for his candidacy. While the So cialists secured a victory for Dr on, the opportunist electorate cast 
their votes for Lafargue’s opponent.  
253. Engels wrote this letter on a form th at had A. Bebel’s a ddress printed on it. 
254. Prior to his trip to Europe in 1893 (see Note 189) Engels had last visited Germ any in the latter half of 
June 1876 as he went to Heidelberg for domestic reasons. 
255. Engels was in Berlin from September 1841 to Oct ober 1842 after he had joined as a volunteer to do his 
tour of military duty. 
256. Die Freie Volksbühne (‘Free Popular Stage’)—a theat rical society founded in Berlin in 1890. It staged 
theater shows for the populace and championed classical  authors like Goethe, Schiller, Hauptmann, Ibsen 
as well as Gogol and Tolstoy. It was not a commerci al enterprise; it put on performances in circumvention 
of official censorship. 
257. Returning together with A. Bebel from the Zu rich Working-Men’s Congress (see Note 229), Engels 
stayed for a few days in Vienna. On 11 September 1893 Austrian Social-Democrats organised a reception 
which, according to the Vienna newspaper Die Arbeiter-Zeitung of 15  September 1893, was attended by 
about 600 people. There was another rally on 14 Septem ber, at which about 2,000 took part, on the results 
of the Zurich Congress. The speakers included V Adle r, A. Bebel and other de legates to the Congress. 
Engels spoke at the end of the meeting (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 406-07). 
258. After the stormy anti-Austrian demonstrations of the summer of 1893 at which the protesters demanded 
universal suffrage, the Taafe government imposed a st ate of emergency in the Prague district on 12 
September 1893. It banned all Radical-Progre ssist and Social-Democratic publications. 
259. P. Lafargue’s article ‘Die politischen Parteien  in Frankreich und die letzten Wahlen’ published by Die 
Neue Zeit (12. Jg., 1893/1894, Nos. 3, 4 and 5), and also his letter to Engels on 5 September 1893 about 
the results of the election to th e French Chamber of Deputies. V Adler’s article ‘Die Wahlen in 
Frankreich’, published in Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 37) on 15 September 1893, was based on this 
information. 
260. Engels is answering Karl Kautsky’s letter of  20 September 1893 asking permission to publish Heinrich 
Heine’s letter to Marx of 21 September 1844 in Die Neue Zeit. This letter was in the possession of 
Eleanor Marx-Aveling. Kautsky asked Engels to wr ite an introduction to the intended publication, but 
Engels did not do so. The Heine letter was published in Die Neue Zeit (No. 1, 1895-96, Vol. 1) only after 
Engels’ death; Kautsky supplied a commenta ry and a facsimile of Engels’ letter. 
261. A reference to the royalties paid by the publishers of Das Kapital to Marx’s heirs. 
262. On his way back from the International Soci alist Working-Men’s Congress in Zurich (he was 
accompanied by A. Bebel, see Note 229), Engels stopped in Berlin, staying from 16 to 28 September 
1893, where he received a warm recep tion. A rally was held in the Concordia Hall on 22 September in 
which about 4,000 took part. Wilhelm Liebknecht made a speech on the role of Engels in the German 
working-class movement. Engels spoke in re ply (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 409-10).

265. In 1893 William Reeves, a London publisher, prin ted the English translation of A. Bebel’s book Die Frau 
und der Sozialismus (‘Woman and Socialism), without any prior consultations either with the author or 
with the translator, Mrs. Adams Walter, who had pr epared the first English edition, published in London 
in 1885 by  The Modern Press. The book’s title (Die Frau in der Vergangenhe it, Gegenwart und Zukunft) 
was Bebel’s own and was retained in the German editions, from the Second to the Eighth (1883-90). The 
same name— Women in the Past, Present and Future —was used in all the English translations. 
266. Hermann Blocher, a Swiss Social-Democrat, approach ed Engels with a request to help him in selecting 
the literature in connection with a wo rk on Bruno Bauer he was going to write. 
267. An allusion to the warm recepti on given to Engels at the concluding session of the International Socialist 
Working-Men’s Congress in Zurich (see Note 229). 
268. The French Chamber of Deputies, elected in  August-September 1893 (see Note 208) was to open its 
sessions in November 1893. 
269. Victor Adler made his speech at a rally in one of Vienna’s largest halls, the Schwender Colisuem, on 2 
October 1893; more than 4,000 were in attendance. He spoke against the state of emergency declared in 
the Prague district on 12 September (see Note 258). Adler’s speech was published by Die Arbeiter-
Zeitung (No. 40) on 6 October 1893. 
270. A reference to the draft electoral reform tabl ed in the Austrian Reichskrat on 10 October 1893 by 
Ministerpräsident (Premier) Eduard Taaffe whose govern ment represented the conservative bloc of the big 
landed proprietors and top bureaucracy. He was suppor ted by the Polish, Czech and Slovenian feudal-
clerical interests, A broad campaign for a reform of  the country’s electoral system began in the early 
1890s. On 9 July 1893 Social-Democrats organised a mammoth demonstration of Vienna’s workers for 
universal suffrage. Similar demonstrations and rallies were held countrywide. Under the circumstances the 
Taaffe government proposed a draft electoral reform which provided for a considerably wider range of 
prospective voters, but preserved the old curial sy stem and the privileges for the landlords and the 
bourgeoisie. The reactionary political parties, however, opposed the draft law, and the Taaffe cabinet had 
to resign in October 1893. The country’s electoral system was reformed as late as 1896. 
271. Phoenicians —a tribe of seafarers described by Homer in The Odyssey. According to Homer, they 
inhabited the island of Scheria north of Ithaca, the island of Odysseus. 
272. The Social-Democratic Workers’ Party of Aust ria was founded at a unification congress that was in 
session at Heinfeld (Low Austria) on 30 Decem ber 1888—1 January 1889. Th is congress adopted a 
programme (‘Declaration of Principles’) which was ba sed on the fundamental tenets of Marxism. In its 
Declaration the Party defined as its objective a politi cal organisation of the pr oletariat; it pledged to 
promote the class-consciousness of the proletariat. Its other targets incl uded socialisation of the means of 
production, emancipation of Labour, political right s for working people and their education. 
273. Der Sonderbund- —a separatist union of the se ven economicallly backward Catholic cantons formed in 
1843 to resist progressive bourgeois reforms and to defend the privilege s of the Church and the Jesuits. 
The decree of the Swiss Diet of 1847 dissolving the S onderbund served as a pretext for the latter to start 
hostilities against other cantons early in Novemb er. On 23 November 1847, the Sonderbund forces, 
consisting largely of milita detachments, were defeated by the federalist army.

274. Pius IX, who succeeded to the Holy See in  1846 under the conditions of an imminent rev-
olution in Italy, announced a restricted political amnesty and embarked on moderate 
reforms, thus gaining popularity as a ‘liberal  Pope’. The demonstrations of 1846, 1847 and 
early 1848 held under the motto ‘Long Live Pius IX’, turned into a powerful revolutionary 
catalyst. But with the outbreak of the 1848 Revol ution, the Pope appealed to the Catholic 
powers to intervene against the Italian Republic  and, after the defeat of the Revolution, 
followed overtly reac tionary policies. 
275. In January 1848, the Neapolitan troops of King Ferdinand II , subsequently named King 
Bomba for his savage bombardment of Messina in the autumn of that year, ordered a 
shelling of Palermo in an effort to suppress a popular uprising, a move that sparked off the 
bourgeois revolution of 1848-49 in the Italian states. 
276. The years 1890-93 saw a mass campaign for uni versal suffrage in Belgium. In April 1893 
the General Council of the Belgian Workers’ Party (see Note 230) declared a general polit-
ical strike for a revision of the acting electoral  law. Under the pressure of mass actions and 
work stoppages the Chamber of Deputies was compelled, on 18 April 1893, to adopt a law 
on universal suffrage (with certain reservations , however); the franchise was granted to men 
over 25 on the condition they had been resident in the country for no less than a year (res-
idential qualification). On the other hand, this  law introduced a system of multiple voting 
whereby some categories of voters were eligib le for an additional 1-2 ballots depending on 
their property status, education and government service record. 
277. The Young Czechs —a bourgeois-liberal party which cham pioned the interests of the Czech 
bourgeoisie. 
The Old Czechs —the Right Wing of the national m ovement in Bohemia, Moravia And 
Silesia; they expressed th e interests of the nobility.  
278. In view of the Socialists’ success at the elections to the French Chamber of Deputies in 
August-September 1893 (see Note 208), the reacti onary press mounted a campaign of slan-
der accusing them of being German agents on th e pretext that German Social-Democrats had 
donated 2,500 francs to the election fund. In this  connection P. Lafargue wrote to Engels on 
5 September 1893 that French Socialists had be tter not receive money from Germany in the 
future. 
279. Engels means a congress held by the Soci al-Democratic Party of Germany in Cologne on 
22-28 October 1893. The congress heard the repor ts of the Party Execu tive of the Social-
Democratic group in the Reichstag, and disc ussed the Party press, the labour union move-
ment and its support by the Social-Democrats, May Day celebrations in 1894, as well as 
August Bebel’s report Antisemitismus und Sozi aldemokratie’. The delegates came out 
against Social-Democrats taking part in the el ection to the Prussian Landtag and against any 
compromises with the bourgeois parties. 
280. On 10 October 1893 P. Lafargue wrote to Enge ls about the plan to start a newspaper that 
could enable the Workers’ Party to rise to a leading position in  the French Socialist press. 
Here Engels recalls that in 1892 Le Socialiste had announced that it would be a daily news-
paper as of October 1892; the announcement began with the words ‘pour paraître en 
Octobre’ (‘to appear in October’). In actual fact, Le Socialiste continued as a weekly.

1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary and Notes. London, Martin Lawrence, 1934.

283. The Second Congress of the Fr ench Workers’ Party that took place in Paris on 7-9 October 
1893. The Congress was attende d by 92 delegates represen ting 499 trade-union and Party 
organisations. Already at its first meeting th e Congress adopted a Declaration urging inter 
nationalist actions of the proletariat; the Party voiced solidarity with the striking miners of 
France, Britain and Belgium and with militant Socialists in other countries. On the domes 
tic scene, the Declarati on warned against the mounting wave of chauvinism.  
The Congress also considered the returns of the elec tions to the French Chamber of Deputies (see Note 
208), the tasks of Socialist deputies,  Socialist propaganda, etc. The Pa rty Congress stressed the need of 
unity among all Socialists and spoke out for the Soci alist deputies forming a pa rliamentary group in the 
Chamber of Deputies; it also recommended that, whenev er it was possible, they donate their deputy’s fees 
for propaganda.  
A report on the Congress was published by the newspaper Vorwärts (no. 240) on 12 October 1893 
under the headline ‘Der Kongress de r Französischen Arbeiterpartei’.  
284. The letter of Ferdinand Lassalle to Marx and Engels which Engels wa nted published with his notes and a 
preface; this was done by Franz Mehring in 1902. 
285. In the latter half of September 1893 French miners in the departments of Nord and Pas de Calais went on 
strike; the strikers demanded higher wages and a ban on dismissing workers older than forty. The 
stoppage lasted some two mont hs and ended in a defeat. 
At about the same time there was a strike of Be lgian miners who demanded a 10 per cent wage rise. 
This strike, which ended in mid-Octobe r, also fell short of its objectives.  
286. In the summer of 1893, after the announcement of  a lockout in the British mining industry (see this 
volume, pp. 204-05), the employers tried to use strike breakers. On 7 September 1893, as there was unrest 
among the miners of Featherstone (Yorkshire), th e mine owners called in troops who opened fire, 
wounding several people. Thereupon nearly all the co al districts were overrun by government troops, a 
move that caused outrage countrywide. As a result, the employers had to refrain from introducing lower 
pay rates for the time being. 
287. Engels sketched the dr aft of his reply to Ferdinand Wolff on th e reverse side of Wolff’s letter received 
late in October 1893 and containing innuendoes and threats against Engels . Ignorant as he was of Wolff’s 
mental illness, Engels wrote a letter of reply, but it is not known whether it was ever sent. Visiting Wolff 
shortly afterwards, Engels could see at first hand his grave condition. See this volume, pp.222-23, 243. 
288. Victor Adler made a German translation of  the first volume of Stepniak-Kravchinsky’s book The Russian 
Peasantry. Their Agrarian Conditi on, Social Life, and Religion; it was published in English by 
Sonnenschein in 1888. In his letter of 22 Septem ber 1892 Adler asked Engels to secure, through 
Stepniak’s mediation, W Sonnenscheins formal perm ission for the publication of the German translation 
and for paying the royalties due to the author and th e publisher. Stepniak read Adler’s translation and 
wrote a brief preface to it. The book was published by  J.H.W Dietz in Stuttgart in 1893 under the title Der 
russische Bauer.  
289. Karl Kautsky, then in Stuttgart, told Engels in  his letter of 1 November 1893 about his plans to move to 
Austria. In his letter of 25 November 1893, Kautsky explained that, while living in Stuttgart, he felt 
isolated from the Austrian  working-class movement. 
290. Karl Kautsky asked Eduard Bernstein to write an article on the general strike for publication in Die Neue 
Zeit, he hoped this would start a discussion on the subject . Engels’ advice to Bernstein was apparently not 
taken into account, for in February 1894 Die Neue Zeit published Bernstein’s article ‘Der Streik als 
politische Kampfmittel’.

291. The three-class electoral system {Dreiklassenwahl) was introduced in Pru ssia in keeping with 
the electoral law of 30 May 1849, after the de feat of the 1848-49 Revolution. This system 
provided for high property qualifi cations and, consequently, contributed to unequal repre-
sentation. 
292. The reference is to the Croatian border regi ments stationed in the Military Border Area, a 
special military region of the Austrian Empire along the frontier with Turkey. 
Ruthenes (Ruthenians) —the name given in the nineteenth-century West-European 
ethnographical and historical works to the Ukrainian population of Galicia, Bukovina and 
the Eastern Carpathians, who were separated at the time from the rest of the Ukrainian 
people.  
293. A reference to Karl Marx. ‘Le Capital’. Extraits  faits par M. Paul Laforgue, Vilfredo Pareto 
wrote the introduction. This book was publis hed by Guillaumin in Paris in 1893. 
294. Joseph Baernreither, a Liberal deputy, tabled  a draft electoral reform on 13 October 1893; it 
granred voting rights in parliamenrary elections onl y to workers eligible for health insurance. 
They were to form a special curia. The draft law restricted to twenty  the number of worker 
deputies elected in this way. 
295. On 3 November 1893 opponents of the electoral  reform assembled in Vienna’s Ronacher 
Hall. This meering sparked a protest among Social-Democrat workers who responded by a 
demonstration which resulted in  clashes with the police. 
296. Engels sent this letter with the cheque to E Sorge’s address in H oboken; see this volume, pp. 
229. 
297- Engels indicated the following address on th e envelope: Frau Liebknecht, Kantstr. 160, 
Charlotenburg/Berlin (Germany).  
298. Karl Liebknecht, who together with his br other Theodor was doing his tour of duty in the 
Guards Corps of Engineers (Gardenpionieren) sought a court referendar’s job 
(Gerichtsreferendar) at Hamm. Eventually he was offered to choose between Arnsberg and 
Paderborn (Westphalia). 
299. Bimetallism (double currency)—a monetary system ba sed on two metals (chiefly, gold and 
silver) with a fixed ratio to each other as legal tender. 
300. In 594-593 B.C., Solon, an Athenian stat esman and lawgiver, brought in a number of 
reforms so as to remodel the state and economic system of Athens. The situation was char-
acterised by an acute struggle between the aris tocracy and the people. The most important of 
Solon’s reforms was one that abolished the la nd tenure debts of the Athenian peasants and 
prohibited bondage for defaulters, etc. Solon and his laws solidified Athens as a slave-
owning city-state and laid the ke ystones of Athenian democracy. 
301. A reference to the controversy over the McKinley protectionist tariff a dopted in November 
1890 (William McKinley was one of the leaders of the Republican Party [and President of 
the United States in 1897-1901]). The new tariff provided for a dramatic rise in duties on 
merchandise imported to the United States and, as a consequence, sent consumer prices up. 
The situation of the worrking class deteriorat ed as a result. The tariff bill invested the 
President with the right to in crease import duties in the future as well. Engels commented on 
this legislation in his arricle ‘The American Presidential Election’ (see present edition, Vol. 
27, pp. 329-31). 
302. This letter was written on a postcard. Engels indicated the following address: H. Schlüter 
Esq., 936 Washington St., Hoboken, N.J., US America.

303. The Berne Copyright Convention was signed on 9 September 1886 by Great Britain, 
Germany, France, Italy and other countries. 
304. Humpty Dumpty —egg-shaped figure of a well-known nursery rhyme: 
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,  
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.  
All the king’s horses  
And all the king’s men  
Couldn’t put Humpty together again.  
305. In 1867 Benjamin Disraeli, then Chancellor of  the Exchequer, played a crucial role in 
carrying out the Second Reform Act of 1867. 
306. Engels wrote the draft of the reply on the reve rse side of the letter which Paul Arndt had sent 
on 4 December 1893. 
307. On 20 August 1893 Jules Guesde was elected to  the French Chamber of Deputies from the 
town of Roubaix (see this volume, p. 182). 
308. The Dupuy cabinet fell on 25 November 1893 after three-day debates on the government 
declaration in which Charles Dupuy leveled shar p attacks at socialism. The united socialist 
group in the Chamber took a firm stand against the course of the government majority and 
championed social reforms. The new cabinet, head ed by Jean Casimir-Périer, ran into major 
difficulties at the very outset as Jean Juarès, sp eaking in a debate on the tax reform, tabled a 
motion whereby small farms were to be tax ex empt. This proposal, made on behalf of the 
socialist parliamentary group, was carried by a majority of votes; however, Casimir-Périer 
annulled the results of voting to prevent a fall of the new cabinet. 
309. In 1893 the anarchists committed a number of terrorist acts in Paris. Thus, on 9 December 
1893 Auguste Vaillant threw a bomb into the ha ll where the French Chamber of Deputies 
was in session. The government retaliated by the laws against the anarchists (see Note 383) 
and by increasing the police budget. 
310. Laura Lafargue was at the time translating into French Engels’ Ludwig Feuerbach and the 
End of Classical German Philosophy (see present edition, Vol. 26); the translation was pub-
lished in the journal L’Ere nouvelle (No.4 and No. 5, 1894); Engels had read the MS of the 
translation. 
311. Sir Henry Roscoe’s and Carl Schorlemmer’s  work appeared in English under the title A 
Treatise on Chemistry. Volumes I-II I. London-New York, 1877-92; the whole edition 
comprised 9 books. 
The German name of the work was Ausführliches Lehrbuch der Chemie. Bände I-IV. 
Braunschweig, 1877-89. Julius Wilhelm Brühl c ontinued the series beginning with Volume 
V; after C. Schorlemmer’s death the ni ne-volume edition was completed in 1901.  
312. Carl Schorlemmer’s manuscript on the early history of chemistry, as mentioned by Adolf 
Spiegel in the obituary Carl Schorlemmer, was never published. This MS, written in German 
and 650 pages long, is in Manchester University library. 
313. A reference to the English edition of Carl Schorlemmer’s The Rise and Development of 
Organic Chemistry which came out in Manchester and London in 1879. The German text 
was published in 1889 as Der Ursprung und die Entwickl ung der organischen Chemie in 
Brunswick. Arthur Smithells prepared a new English edition which was published in London 
and New York in 1894 under the same title as the 1879 edition.

314. A. Dworzak wrote a letter to Engels on 24-28 November 1893 in which she congratulated 
him on his 73d birthday. 
315. A reference to the so-called ‘original minut e-book’ fabricated by Prussian police spies and 
presented at the Cologne trial of Communi sts in 1852 as the chief evidence for the 
prosecution against members of the Communist League. See present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 
420-43. 
316. Engels never realised this intention. 
317. Edouard Vaillant framed a draft law on abo lishing the regular army and replacing it with a 
national milita; all the Socialist deputies put their signatures to it. 
318. At the trial of Spanish anarchists in Ma drid in 1890 it came out that one of them, Munoz, 
was a police agent. All the defendants were  sentenced to 7 years of forced labour. 
319. Speaking of the harmony between Carnot and the Russian tsar, Engels implied the Franco-
Russian alliance sealed in those days (see No te 177). About the anarchist police bombs, see 
Note 309. 
320. Engels sketched out a version of his reply on the reverse side of Giuseppe Cànepa’s letter of 
3 January 1894. Cànepa asked Engels to find an epigraph to the weekly L’Era nuova due to 
appear in Geneva as of March 1894 ‘which in  a few words could synthesise the Socialist 
ideal and set off the new era against the old er a that is epitomised in the Dantesque words: 
one people rules, and the other languishes’. For the quote given by Engels, see present 
edition, Vol. 6, p. 506. 
321. On 5 January 1894 Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 9) carried the article ‘Das allgemeine 
Wahlrecht eine “konservative Maßregel’”; cited in this article was a passage from K. 
Kautsky’s article ‘Ein sozialdemokratischer  Katechismus’ published in December 1893 by 
Die Neue Zeit (Bd. I, NN 12 and 13, 1893-1894). The publication in Die Arbeiter-Zeitung 
proved the inadequacy and harm of a general political strike in the struggle for electoral 
reform. 
322. The first c ongress of the Austrian trade unions, he ld in Vienna from 24 to 27 December 
1893, set up a single centralised organisation and endorsed a single strike statute for all the 
unions. The congress spoke out against a general st rike as a tool in the struggle for universal 
suffrage. 
The Czech Social-Democrats held thei r congress on 24-26 December 1893 in Budweis 
(the present name, Ceské Budejovice). It passed a decision on forming a Czechoslavonian 
Social-Democratic Party [Ceskoslovanská Sociál ne domekraticka strana] on the basis of the 
principles proclaimed by the Unification C ongress of the Austrian Social-Democrats at 
Heinfeld in 1888 (see Note 272).  
The proceedings of the congresses held by  the Austrian trade unions and the Czech 
Social-Democrats were covered by Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (NN 1 and 2) on 2 and 5 January 
1894. 
323. The fourth Congress of the Social-Democratic  Party of Austria was held in Vienna on 25- 
31 March 1894. The Congress passed a resolution stating that the Austrian workers 
intended to campaign for universal suffrage us ing all available means, including a general 
strike. The congress also adopted new Party Rule s and resolved to continue with the annual 
May Day celebrations by holding demonstrations  for an 8-hour day, universal suffrage and 
in support of international br otherhood among all working people.

324. Engels wrote the following address on the envelope : G.W. Lamplugh Esq., Geological Survey, 28 Jermyn 
St., S.W.  
325- Robert Burton’s The Anatomy of Melancholy was first published under the pen name Democritus Junior in 
1621. George William Lamplugh sent a copy of  the ninth edition published in London in 1800.  
326. Engels wrote the draft of his reply on the reve rse side of Henri Ravé’s  letter of 1 January 1894. 
327. Engels alludes to Karl Höger’s speech at the congress of the Austrian trade unions (see Note 322). 
328. Engels wrote these lines in the left margin of Albert Delon’s letter of 19 Ja nuary 1894 in which the sender 
asked for permission to translate Volume II  of Das Kapital into French. The whereabouts of Engels’ 
letter to A. Delon is not known. 
329. Engels replies to W Borgius’ letter of 19 January 1894. The journal Der sozialistische Akedemiker (No. 
20, 1895) published this reply for the first time toge ther with the addressee’s name; the subsequent 
publications gave the wrong name, Heinz Starkenburg. 
The condensed English version of the letter was firs t published in: K. Marx, F. Engels, V.I. Lenin, On 
the Theory of Marxism, International Publishers, New York, [1948].  
330. On 26 January 1894 the newspaper Vorwärts published a lengthy article entitled ‘Ein edles 
Brüderpaar’ which claimed that Theodor Re uß and Heinrich Oberwinder had, beginning 
in 1886, been publicly exposed by the press as police spies.  
As R. Fischer wrote in his letter of 27 January 1894, Reuß had voiced protes t over this article and 
denied any connection between his departure from The Daily Chronicle and the exposures in Vorwärts. 
On 14 January 1894, Fischer also asked Engels if  he remembered a second publication on Reuß in 
Vorwärts .  
331. The Erfurt Congress of the German Social -Democratic Party took place on 14 to 20 October 1891. 
Among the other issues, the Congress discussed and adopted a new Party Programme which, despite 
some shortcomings, was essentially based on Marxist principles. The critic ism of the original draft of the 
Programme, which Engels made in his work A Critique  of the Draft of the Social-Democratic Programme 
of 1891’ (see present edition, Vol. 27), applies in pa rt to the adopted Programme. The decisions of the 
Erfurt Congress sealed the Marxist tre nd in Germany’s working-class movement. 
332. Apparently a reference to the fee for the Engels pamphlet Internationales aus dem ‘Volksstaat’ (1871-75) 
published in Berlin by the Vorwärts Editorial Board. 
333. Engels left for Eastbourne on 9 February or ther eabouts because of poor health; he stayed there until 1 
March 1894. 
334. The reference is to the Engels article ‘The Future  Italian Revolution and the Socialist Party’ (see present 
edition, Vol. 27, pp. 437-40) published by Critica Sociale (No. 3) on 1 February 1894; Victor Adler 
probably did not finish the tran slation of this article for Die Arbeiter-Zeitung, however, it appeared in Der 
Sozialdemokrat on 12 July 1894 under the heading ‘Friedrich Engels über die Lage in Italien’. 
335. Engels probably means the violent repr ession by the crew of the German cruiser Die Hyäne of a mutiny 
of native soldiers in the Cameroons on 21 December 1893. 
336. Eduard Bernstein, Karl Kautsky and other author s were preparing a series of works on the history of 
socialism. In this connection Kautsky as ked Engels in his letter of 7 February

337. Engels jotted down the draft of his reply on the reve rse side of the letter from Professor Gizycki of Berlin, 
dated 14 February 1894; Georg von Gizycki asked Enge ls to contribute an article to the weekly Ethische 
Kultur on the ethical designation of the woman. 
338. This letter was written on a postcard. Engels i ndicated the following address: Ed. Bernstein Esq., 50

founded in 1892 at a congress in Genoa. The Party t ook a resolute stand in distancing itself from the 
anarchists; in 1895 it changed its name and came to be  known as The Italian Socialist Party [Il Partito 
socialista italiano]. 
341. Engels congratulated Adelheid Dworzak and Julius Popp on their marriage which took place early in 
February 1894. 
342. In February 1894 the French Chamber of Deputies de bated the issue of corn ta riffs. Jean Juarès proposed 
a law which provided for a state monopoly on grain imports. Jules Guesde supported this motion. 
343. The Congress of the Socialist Workers’ Party of  Germany in Wyden (Switzerland) was held in August 
1890. That was the first illegal congress of the Germ an Social-Democrats following the introduction of 
the Anti-Socialist Law of 1878 (see Note 15). The Congr ess criticised the anarchist stand of Johann Most 
and Wilhelm Hasselmann, who rejected all legal m eans of struggle, advocated individual terror and 
launched an open campaign against the Party l eadership; it expelled them from the Party. 
The Congress unanimously decided to strike out the word ‘legal’ from the statement contained in Part 
II  of the Gotha Programme of 1875 to the effect that the Party was working to attain its goals ‘with all 
legal means’. The Congress confirmed the status of Der Sozialdemokrat as the Party’s official organ.  
344. As August Momberger wrote to Engels on 26 Februa ry 1894, he wanted to take part in disseminating 
socialist ideas among foreigners resident in Wiesbaden,  the English in the first place. He asked Engels to 
recommend the significant socialist, socio-political and natural science works, as well as some English 
journal similar to the German Die Neue Zeit.  
345. On 12-29 July 1894 Britain had a parliamentary election which gave th e Conservatives a majority of over 
150 votes in the Commons. Many candidates from th e Independent Labour Party, among them Keir 
Hardie, were blackballed. 
346. Speaking in the Commons on 19 March 1894, Ra ndolph Churchill proposed a bill banning members of 
the Liberal cabinet from interfering in the course of future parliamentary elections and from speaking in 
the constituencies. 
347. Engels means the articles published anonymously by Der Arbeiter-Zeitung (Nos. 19-22) on 6, 13 and 16 
March 1894; apparently they were written by Victor Adle r. The article that Engels refers to appeared on 6 
March 1894, likewise without a signature; it was entitled ‘Die Wahlreform Stadnicki’. It criticised the 
draft of an electoral reform suggested by the co alition government of Alfred von Windischgrätz. The bill 
envisaged only an insignificant increase in the Reic hstag representation by setting up a fifth curia.

348. The draft of this letter, which Engels wrote on the back side of Panait Musoiu’s letter of 24 
February 1894, is extant. The texts of the draft and the letter are identical.  
Musoiu told Engels he had translated into Roumanian Socialism: Utopian and Scientific 
and The Manifesto of the Communist Party. He asked Engels to write a preface to a second 
edition of these works.  
349. In the summer of 1894 Victor Adler had to serve a prison term of 2.5 months on several 
counts: 14 days for a public insult to the dist rict commissioner of the town of Ceska-Lipa, 
one month for his speech at a public rally in  Vienna’s Schwender Coliseum on 30 October 
1893 and yet another month for his speech in the same ‘coliseum’ on 28 January 1894. 
350. By using the conventional symbols adopted in biology (for the male sex and for the female 
sex), Engels meant Die Arbeiter-Zeitung, and Die Arbeiterinnen-Zeitung, a newspaper for the 
working women. Both were published in Vienna. 
351. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in K. Marx, E Engels, V.I. Lenin, 
Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism. International Publishers, New York, 1972. 
352. Carlism —onslaughts of the feudal reactionaries who unleashed two civil wars in Spain, in 
1833-40 and in 1872-76, in the form of dynastic  feuds between two lines of the Spanish 
Bourbons. Defeated in these wars were the Carlists, supporters of Don Carlos the Elder, 
whom they had proclaimed king in 1833. The Ca rlists relied on the backward strata of the 
peasantry and opposed forces interested in Sp ain’s capitalist development. The two Carlist 
wars resulted in a weakening of the feudal-cler ical strata and a strengthening of the positions 
of the bourgeoisie. 
353. The Spanish anarchists had been perpetrating acts of terrorism since the late 1880s (in 1889 
they bombed the royal palace). 
354. Be nno Karpeles sent Engels his book Der Arbeiter des mährisch-s chlesischen Steinkohlen-
Reviers. In his letter of 19 March 1894 he praised E ngels as a scientist and author of the 
work The Condition of the Working-Class in England and as an outstanding socialist. 
355. In her letter of 11 April 1894 Laura Lafargue to ld Engels that the Fren ch anarchists (liber-
taires) were out to publish one of the works of  Eugen Dühring. In this connection Bonnet, 
the secretary of the Editorial Board of the journal L’Ere nouvelle, suggested that a transla-
tion into French of Engels’ work Anti-Dühring should be begun without de lay so as to have 
it ready before the appearance of Dühring’s book.  Such a translation did not materialise at 
the time. 
356. Speaking in the Reichstag on 7 April 1894, Earl von Kanitz  proposed a state monopoly of 
grain imports and exports; the state was likewise to fix grain prices. The Social-Democrats 
voted against; on 14 July 1894 the motion was rejected by 159 votes against 49. 
357. Marx’s Speech on the Question of Free Trade was published by L’Ère nouvelle (no. 6, 1894) 
and by Le Socialiste (No. 194-196, on 23, 30 June and 7 July 1894). 
358. The English translation of Marx’s Speech on the Question of Free Trade was published in 
Boston in 1888; it was prefaced by an introduction (Free Trade) written by Engels; it was 
published in Boston and London in 1889. The Ita lian translation of Marx’s speech was pub-
lished in La Critica Sociale (Nos. 7 and 8) on 1 and 16 April 1894; the same periodical car-
ried Engels’ introduction on 1 and 16 May and 1 June 1894 (Nos. 9, 10 and 11) [see also this 
volume, p. 297] ; both works then appeared in a booklet published in Milan in 1894. 
359. Engels wrote the following address on the e nvelope that still remains: Sig. aw° Filippo 
Turati, Portici Galleria VE. 23, Milano, Italy.

of the French Worker s’ Party in Calais. 
363. The reference is to the proof sh eets of the French edition of Marx’s Speech on the Question 
of Free Trade (see note 357). 
364. The Italian translation of Marx’s Speech on the Question of Free Trade, put out in La Critica 
Sociale, was made from the Russian text published as a supplement to Marx’s work Misère 
de la philosophie (Poverty of Philosophy) and translated from the German edition of 1885 by 
Georgi Plekhanov. 
365. Engels wrote the following a ddress on the envelope: Sig. aw° Filippo Turati, Portici Galeria

(abridged). 
367. This is how Engels referred to members of  the Socialist Labour Party of North America 
founded in 1876, in which German emigrés continued to figure prominently. 
368. Boris Krichevsky, a Russian emigré Socialist, had sent Engels the Russian translations of 
Marx’s works The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and Wage Labour and Capital with 
Engels’ introduction to the 1891 edition (see pr esent edition, Vols. 11,9,26); both works, 
published in Geneva in 1894 in the series Social-Democratic Library, were translated into 
Russian by Krichevsky. He told Engels in his letter that the same publishers undertook the 
printing of Engels’ article ‘On Social Relations in Russia’ (in the series of his articles Refugee 
Literature) [see present edition, Vol. 24] . Krichevsky asked Engels to write a preface to the 
Russian edition of the above article. However,  the printing was stopped because of protest 
from Engels who had earlier given Vera Zasulic h the copyright. This article appeared in V 
Zasulich’s translation in The Library of Contemporary Socialism (Geneva, 1894) under the 
title ‘Friedrich Engels on Russia. 1) A Repl y to P.N. Tkachev (1875), 2) The Afterword 
(1894)’. 
369. First published in English in: K. Marx and F. Engels, On Britain. Moscow, Foreign

370. Some of the works written by Engels in 1871-75 were republished in Berlin in 1894 in a 
separate edition entitled Internationales aus dem ‘Volksstaat’ (1871-75).  
371. On 7 June 1894 Nikolai Daniel son told Engels he had not recieved the next sheets of 
Volume II I of Das Kapital. He recommended a translator for the German edition of his 
Essays on Our Post-Reform Social Economy.  
372. The Russian ed ition of Engels’ work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State 
appeared in St. Petersburg in 1894. It was publis hed with deletions made by the censor, in 
particular relating to Marx and his works.

with a General Industrial Map, St. Petersburg, 1893. Russia was among th e countries participating in the 
exhibition sponsored by the U.S. Congress to comm emorate the quadricennial of America’s discovery 
and its discoverer, Columbus.  
374. Eugéne Turpin, a French chemist who in 1885 i nvented melinite, a powerful explosive, was accused of 
trying to sell his invention to a foreign power; he  was cleared of this charge. However, he was 
nevertheless sentenced to five years in prison for publishing in 1889 a pamphlet on this episode. Turpin 
was pardoned on 10 April 1893. The newspaper Le Temps said on 2 June 1894 that the aim of the whole 
affair was publicity for the firm exploiting the Turpin invention. 
375. An allusion to the case of the Building Society whose director, Spe nder Jabez Balfour, had fled overseas. 
Anthony John Mundells, an MP from Sheffield, Presiden t of the Board of Trade and, until 1892, Director 
of the New Zealand Loan Company, had to re sign on 12 May 1894. Acting together with James 
Fergusson and John Gorst, he in 1893 closed down the company that had become the target of a public 
investigation. 
376. Stanislaw Zablocki in his letter of 3 June 1894 as ked for permission to publish the Polish translation of 
Engels’ article ‘The Polish Proklamation’. 
377. The central organ of the Austri an Social-Democratic Workers’ Party Die Arbeiter-Zeitung was a weekly 
newspaper in 1893; it became a semiweekly in 1894 and a daily as of January 1895. 
378. The French President S. Carnot was assassinated by  Santo Caserio, an Italian anarchist, on 24 June 1894. 
On 17 August 1893, the Aiguesmortes salt mines in S outhern France were the scene of bloody clashes 
between French and Italian workers;  the cause of the conflict was that the employers were paying higher 
wages to the French workers than to their Italian mates. 
379. Apparently Engels wrote this letter after Hellmut  von Gerlach had visited him late in June 1893 on Major 
Otto Wachs’ recommendation. 
380. Der Sozialdemokrat (Zurich) on 24 December 1887 promulgated a list of Berlin police agents. Among the 
agents exposed by Swiss Socialists was Heinrich  Oberwinder, formerly a member of the First 
International (see also Engels’ letter to Paul Lafa rgue of 29 December 1887, pr esent edition, Vol. 48). 
381. For cited passages see present edition, Vol. 37, Part I, K. Marx, Capital, Vol. II I, present edition, pp. 374, 
378, 382. 
382. In connection with a third German edition of Anti-Dühring due for publication, Engels revised somewhat 
the Marx-written Chapter X of the second part of this work; the title of the chapter was From 
‘CriticalHistory ’(see present edition, Vol. 25, pp. 211-43, and also p. 15); the third edition of Anti-
Dühring was off in Stuttgart in 1894. 
383. Using the anarchist acts of terror as a pretext, th e French government enacted la ws against anarchists, the 
vague wording of which made it possible to apply them against Socialists as well.  The first enactment was 
endorsed in December 1893 after August Vaillant had th rown a bomb in the French Chamber of Deputies 
(see Note 309); the second enactment was approved at  the end of July 1894 af ter the assassination of 
President Carnot by the Italian anarchist Caseri o (see Note 378), against heavy resistance from the 
Socialists and some of the Radicals. These two bills  imposed restrictions on freedom of the press and 
provided for special courts to handle cases of violation of the laws on the press.

384. Twenty-two German emigrés took part in the Scotch mi ners’ strike being held at the time. In their latter of 
19 July 1894 signed by August Siegel and other German miners, they asked Engels to send their message 
to the Executive of the German Soci al-Democratic Party in which they requested a loan of 300 marks; 
they also asked Engels to approach Julius Mottele r and other comrades in London with a request for 
material assistance. 
385. First published in English in K. Marx and F. Engels, On the United States, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 
1979 (abridged). 
386. Concerning Paul Lafargue’s ne gotiations with the Paris publisher Charles Marie Delagrave about the 
publication of his work Origine et évolution de la propriété (see Note 567). 
387. F. Turati wrote, on this letter with his own hand: ‘Scritto a Treves. R[isposto] 2./8./94. Tornato a 
rispondere 678794/ (‘Written in Treves. Replied 2787947. In receipt of reply a new letter was written 
6./8./94.’) 
388. In 1893-94 Sicily was the stage of sporadic peasant revolts caused by the aftermath of an economic crisis 
and abuses of the local administration. Th e revolts were crushed by brute force. 
389. It was stated on the reverse side of the letter that th e parcel and the letter with it were for Victor Adler; the 
parcel contained newspapers that c ould not be sent to Austria, while enclosed in the letter was about two 
pounds sterling. Engels was asked to get this lette r to the addressee; the signature was illegible. 
390. At the request of Pablo Iglesias, Engels wrote the appeal ‘To the English Socialist and Working Men’s 
Organisations’ (see present edition, Vol. 27) in wh ich he gave notice of th e forthcoming 4th annual 
Congress of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party. He se nt similar appeals also to  the Social-Democrats of 
Austria and Germany. 
The Fourth Congress of the Spanish Socialist Work ers’ Party took place in Madrid from 29 August to 
1 September 1894. The Congress heard reports of the Party’s National C ouncil and of a delegate who had 
attended the International Socialis t Working-Men’s Congress in Zurich (held in 1893, see Note 229); it 
discussed the issue of the Party press and adopted the new Party Rules. The Congress received numerous 
messages of greeting from the British organisations to which Engels had appealed, as well as from the 
Socialists of Britain, Austria, Germany and other countries.  
391. A reference to the Gas Workers’ and General Labour ers’ Union, the first union of unskilled workers in the 
history of the British labour movement. It was formed  in late March-early Ap ril 1889 under the conditions 
of a mounting strike movement. A major contributi on to the foundation and work of the union was made 
by Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling. The Un ion campaigned for the legal eight hours. It gained 
considerable influence within a short span of tim e; as many as 100,000 gas works employees joined it 
within a year. 
392. A reference to the Fourth International Socia list Working-Men’s Congress (S econd International) which 
met in London in July 1896. 
393. Engels was taking a rest in Eastbourne from 14 August to 18 September 1894. 
394. Engels probably refers  to the speeches made at the Zurich International Socialist Working-Men’s 
Congress (see Note 229) by some members of the Fr ench delegation who levele d sharp criticism at the 
parliamentary activity of Socialists  and put forward the idea of social revolution by means of a general 
strike. Among the members of the French delegati on was Paul Arndt, a Paris correspondent of the 
newspaper Vorwärts.

395. In his letter to Engels on 12 August 1894 Eduard Bernstein wrote about the International Congress of 
Textile Workers held in Manchester in July 1894; in  his opinion, it was an attempt to divorce trades-union 
congresses from socialist congr esses. In this context Bernstein also  mentioned Paul Arndts article about 
the Manchester Congress,  which appeared in Vorwärts on 2 August 1894. (Subseque ntly Engels received 
the issue of the newspaper Der Textil-Arbeiter with commentaries on the Congress.) Bernstein asked 
Engels what he thought of the Manc hester Congress and of the decision of the conference of the Social-
Democratic Federation (see Note 44) to convene an ex clusively socialist congress prior to the congress of 
1896 (see this volume, pp. 340-41, 343). The present letter contains Engels’ reply to Bernstein’s 
questions. 
396. The 27th Annual Congress of the British Trades-U nions was held in Norwich on 3-8 September 1894. 
The Trades-Union Congress spoke out for the legal eight  hours and for the nationalis ation of all means of 
production, distribution and exchange; for Engels’ asse ssment of this congress, see this volume, pp. 341, 
343-44, 347. 
397. In his letter of 15 August 1894, Thomas Clark as ked Engels if he could vouch for Stanislaw Mendelson 
‘as a yearly tenant’. 
398. Filippo Turati wrote to Engels in his letters of  2 and 6 August 1894 he had made inquiries about Felice 
Pasquali, an Italian emigré in London (see this volume, pp. 333, 338-39) a nd received contradictory 
references; thus, some called him ‘seccatore di prima sfera’ (‘a burr of the first water’). 
399. Engels had stayed in Milan for three months in 1841. 
400. Together with his letter of 2 August 1894 Filippo Turati sent Engels a photograph of a mold cast in 
Florence from the bust of K. Marx and asked him as well as Eleanor Marx-Aveling to confirm the 
likeness of the replica before it was cast. 
401. Engels means the Exceptional Law on Public Secur ity passed by the Italian Parliament on 14 July 1894. 
This law, enacted with the aim of combatting the an archists, was used by the Crispi government against 
the working-class movement and Socialists as well. It banned the Socialist Party of the Italian Working 
People (Il Partito Socialista dei lavoratori italiani), closed worker organisations and worker periodicals; 
arbitrary arrests, searches and trials assumed mass proportions. All this notwithstanding, the Italian 
Socialists kept up their struggle and, in January  1895, they convened in Parma illegally for a third 
congress of their party. 
402. Belfast was the venue of the Twenty-Sixth Annual Trades-Union Congress. It r ecognised the principle of 
collective ownership of the means of production and distribution and supported the demand for the legal 
eight hours. 
403. The International Congress of Trade Unions, c onvened in London in November 1888 at the initiative of 
the British trades unions, involved delegates from Belg ium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy as well as 
representatives of the the trade-uni on organisations in France. However, Germany and Austria were not 
represented—trade unions were illega l there and could not send their delegates. The Congress called on 
the working people to wage a struggle for labour prot ection laws and for the legal eight hours; it adopted 
a decision on convening an International Working- Men’s Congress in Paris in 1889 (see Note 227). 
404. A reference to the 14th Annual Conference of the Social Democratic Federation, held in London on 5 and 
6 August 1894.

405. New Unionism —a development in the British trade-uni on movement at the end of the 1880s 
in the shape of the ‘new’ trades unions. Unlike the old craft unions—admitting craft workers 
exclusively—the new unions were open to labour ers as well. The new labour organisations 
were formed by the various trades employed  in a given industry (general unions). British 
Socialists, in particular Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Tom Mann, played a major part in setting 
up the new trades unions. Engels made an appraisa l of New Unionism in his article ‘May 4 in 
London’ and in the Preface to the 1892 English Edition of The Condition of the Working 
Class in England (see, present edition, Vol. 27). 
406. The 12th Congress of the French Workers’ Party {Le Parti ouvrier français) took place in 
Nantes on 14-16 September 1894 in a situation characterised by a mounting peasant move-
ment, reactionary onslaughts and growing differences in the French Socialist movement. The 
Congress pointed to the heavier commitment of  the French working people against the anti-
Socialist laws of 1893-94 (see Note 383) and distanced itself from the anarchists who, by 
their terrorist acts, provided a pretext for adopti on of these laws. In one of its major decisions 
the Congress adopted the motivational part of the Party’s agrarian programme and 
incorporated a number of specific demands in to it. For Engels’ critique of the Nantes 
agrarian programme see The Peasant Question in France and Germany (see present edition, 
Vol. 27). 
407. This and the preceding paragraph deal  with an article on Volume II I of Das Kapital which 
E. Bernstein intended to write for Die Neue Zeit (see Note 542); having read the proof sheets 
of Volume II I, he told Engels in his lette r of 5 September 1894 about the errata he had 
found. Bernstein refused to fulf ill H. Schlüters request to cont ribute an article on the same 
subject for New Yorker Volkszeitung.  
408. As Eduard Bernstein wrote to Engels on 5 September 1894, Joseph Edwards invited him to 
write a series of articles on the situation of the German Social-Democ ratic Workers’ Party 
and its plans for the future; the proposed materials were intended for The Labour Annual, a 
publication that J. Edwards was editing. Bernstei n also told Engels that Edward Aveling had 
advised him not to take pa rt in that publication. 
409. An allusion to the Chino-Japanese War of  1894-95 which ended in China’s defeat. By the 
Peace Treaty of Shimonoseki, Korea, overrrun by  Japan, received nom inal independence. 
China ceded a number of its islands (including Taiwan) to Japan. China was also to pay a 
war indemnity of 200,000,000 taels. 
410. First published in English in K. Marx and F. Engels, On Colonialism. Progress Publishers, 
Moscow, 1959 (abridged). 
411. The fees for the articles which Engels wrote for Die Neue Zeit were being sent, according to 
his instructions, to V. Adler for the Austrian Social-Democra ts. However, since the royalties 
due for the chapters for Das Kapital, published in the same periodical, had been remitted by 
mistake to V Adler’s account, Engels asked fo r the reimbursement of the sum to Marx’s 
heirs at the expense of his article ‘On the Hist ory of Early Christian ity’ (see present edition, 
Vol. 27). 
412. On 14 and 21 October 1894 Belgium had its first elections in accordance with the new 
electoral law adopted on 18 April 1893 (see Note 276). The Belgian Workers’ Party 
succeeded in having 30 of its representatives  elected to the Chamber of Deputies. 
By calling the Belgian elections a second victory,  Engels meant to say that the first victory 
was won in April 1893 when the Belgians gained universal suffrage.

418. Engels refers to a congress of the Social-Democra tic Party of Germany held in Frankfurt am Main on 21-
27 October 1894. The co-report on the main issue on th e agenda—the agrarian question—was made by 
Georg von Vollmar, the leader of the Bavarian Social -Democrats; he insisted on augmenting the agrarian 
programme by clauses expressing the in terests of all the peasantry, incl uding the affluent strata. Some of 
the delegates, August Bebel among them, voiced objec tions. The congress elected a commission that was 
to draft the final text of the Party’s agrarian pr ogramme as a supplement to the general programme. In 
addition, delegates heard the reports  of the Party Executive Board and the Party group in the Reichstag; it 
considered such issues as the role of trusts  and other major capitalist amalgamations, May Day 
celebrations, etc. 
The final account of the proceedings of the Fra nkfurt Congress of the German Social-Democratic 
Party was published by the newspaper Vorwärts (No. 254) on 31 October 1894.  
419. A reference to P. Lafargue’s report ‘La proprié té paysanne et l’évoluti on économique’, presented on 
behalf of the National C ouncil of the French Workers’ Party to  its Nantes congress (see Note 406). 
Lafargue’s report was also published by Der Sozialdemokrat (No. 38, supplement) on 18 October 1894.

Vorwärts published Ledebour’s objections on 21 November 1894.  
425. On 14 November 1894 August Bebel spoke at a part y meeting in Berlin’s second constituency with a 
critique of the stand taken by Geor g von Vollmar and other Bavarian So cial-Democrats at the Frankfurt 
Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party (s ee Note 418) and of the resolution adopted by the 
Congress on the agrarian que stion. Bebel’s speech was published by the newspaper Vorwärts (No. 268) 
on 16 November and reprinted in La Critica Sociale (No. 23) on 1 December 1894. 
426. The agrarian programme sparked great controvers y within the International Working-Men’s Association 
(First International). It was hammered out in an acute struggle against the Proudhonists, who were 
insisting on the immutability of petty private ownershi p of land, and the Bakuninists, out to prove that 
with the abolition of inheritance, private propert y—including private ownership of land—would wither 
away. After prolonged debates the Bru ssels Congress of the First Intern ational (1868) and then its Basel 
Congress (1869) recogni sed the abolition of private ownership of  land and its transformation into public 
ownership as a necessary condition. 
427. The anonymous note ‘On the Fourth Volume of Karl  Marx’s Capital’ (see present edition, Vol. 27) was 
written by Engels in reply to an editorial carried by the newspaper Vorwärts (No. 266) on 14 November 
1894 about the publication of Volume II I of Capital. The editorial contained false data on the nature of 
the manuscript of Volume IV; in addition, the edito rs wrongly assumed Engels had given up his intention 
to have it published. Engels’ refutati on was published by Karl Kautsky in Die Neue Zeit (No. 9), 1894-95, 
Vol. 1. 
428. Engels refers to the Draft of a Law on amendm ents and addenda to the Cr iminal Code, the Military 
Criminal Code and the legislation on the press (‘ Der Entwurf eines Gesetzes, betreffend Änderungen und 
Ergänzungen des Strafgesetzbuchs, des Militärstrafgesetzbuc hs und des Gesetzes über die Presse), known 
for short as the Subversion Bill (‘Umsturzvollage’). It envisaged hars h punishment for ‘the intention to 
effect an overthrow of the existing state system’ even  in the absence of a crim inal act, and also for an 
encroachment on religion, monarchy, matrimony and pr operty. The government tabled the draft law in the 
Reichstag in December 1894, but the top Germ an legislature rejected it in May 1895. 
429. On 26 October 1894 Reichskanzle r Leo von Caprivi was forced to resign; he was succeeded by Fürst 
(Prince) zu Hohenlohe-Schillings. 
430. In his letter of 12 November 1894 Nikolai Danielson told Engels about the publication of Pyotr Struve’s 
book Critical Notes on the Question of the Economic Development of Russia and asked permission to 
quote passages from Engels’ letters to hi m in his comments on the above book. 
431. A reference to the second congress held by the Bavarian Social-Democratic organisation on 30 September 
1894 in Munich. It was attended by 160 delegates. Two questions were on the agenda: 1) the activity of 
Social-Democratic Deputies in the Bavarian Landt ag and 2) agitation among the peasants. Georg von 
Vollmar and Karl Grillenberger drew support from th e majority of the congr ess which approved the 
activity of the Social-Democratic parliamentary group and adopted a decision on setting up a special 
organisation of the Bavarian Social-Democratics unde r the central guidance of the Landtag deputies—von 
Vollmar, Karl Grillenberger and others. 
Sonderbund —an ironic analogy with the separatist uni on of reactionary Catholic cantons in 
Switzerland in the 1840s (see Note 273); here Engels means the separatist leanings of the Bavarian 
Social-Democrats.

594 Notes 
432. Engels means the two editorial material s probably written by Wilhelm Liebknecht: the 
leading article in the newspaper Vorwärts (No. 273, 23 November 1894) under the title ‘In 
eigener Sache’ and a note under the same name carried by Vorwärts (No. 274, 24 November 
1894) in the section Zur Diskussion über den Frankfurter Parteitag. The editors said in the 
former article they were ‘diametrically opposed ’ to what Bebel had said at the meeting in 
the second constituency of Berlin (see Note 425) . In the latter publica tion the editors said 
that in the leading article in Vorwärts on 23 November 1894 they had meant only ‘Bebel’s 
pessimistic appraisal of the en tire course of the proceedings at the Party Congress and its 
spiritual level’ (about the Frankfurt Congress see Note 418). 
433. Engels means the anonymous article ‘The Movement in Germany’ published in  Justice (No. 
568) on 1 December 1894. The author of that  article reproached  the editors of Vorwärts for 
their silence about the differences among the German Social-Democrats over the agrarian 
issue and the attacks on Justice and Hyndman. A reply to that ar ticle appeared in the next 
issue of Justice (No. 569) on 8 December 1894; it was E. Bernstein’s statement ‘The 
Vorwärts and Justice . To the Editor of Justice in which he rebutted the accusations. 
434. A reference to A. Bebel’s sp eech in the second constituency of Berlin on 14 November 1894 
(see Note 425). 
Georg von Vollmar and Karl Gr illenberger replied with a pr ess polemic. Thus, on 17 and 
21 November 1894 Grillenberger publis hed notes in his newspaper Frankische Tagespost in 
which he commented on the above speech and which were reprinted by the newspaper 
Vorwärts (Nos. 271 and 274); on 20 and 24 November 1894 von Vollmar burst into print in 
the newspaper Münchener Post with a series of articles entitled Bebel’s Fahnenerhebung 
which soon after were reprinted by the newspaper Vorwärts (Nos. 273, 274 and 276) on 23, 
24 and 27 November 1894. A.Bebel responded by two statements and four articles under the 
general title Zur Diskussion über den Frankfurt er Parteitag. Zur Entgegnung which were 
published by Vorwärts in November-December 1894.  
435. Filippo Turati wrote to tell Engels on 28 N ovember 1894 that a Socialist group of Italian 
university students was planning to release an Almanocco socialista per l’anno 1895 and 
would like to have a short note from him. 
436. On 6 December 1894 the members of the Social -Democratic faction in the Reichstag did not 
rise but remained seated as the Reichstag Pr esident von Levetzow had proposed the health of 
Emperor William II , and the other deputies had stood up to shout three ‘hurrahs!’ Such 
behaviour of the Social-Democratic group was qualified as lèse-majesté , thereupon the district 
court of Berlin decided to start criminal proceedings against Liebknecht. On 11 December 
the Reichskanzler, Prince zu Hohenlohe, dema nded that the Reichstag approve the court 
decision. But on 15 December the Reichstag rej ected this demand by 168 votes against 58. 
437. A reference to the speech made by Georg von Vollmar at an open Social-Democratic meet-
ing in Munich on 1 June 1891 on the targets and tactics of the Party under the conditions of 
the ‘new course’ so-called proclaimed by th e Caprivi government. He attempted to get the 
Social-Democratic Party to cooperate with the ruling classes in matters of both domestic and 
foreign policy, especially in the event of a war within Russia. Von Vollmar’s speech, which 
received approval from th e bourgeois press, was condemned at  Party meetings, by most of 
the Party’s newspapers and then at the Er furt Congress which t ook place on 14-20 October 
1891. 
438. Engels refers to the polemics of the newspaper Vorwärts with Georg von Vollmar, which was 
touched off by his article ‘Le socialisme de M. Bismarck et le socialisme de l’empereur

Guillaume’ published by the French journal Revue bleue. Revue politique et littéraire in June 1892. Von 
Vollmar claimed that some of the pl anks of the Erfurt Programme of the German Social-Democratic Party 
were akin to the state socialism of Bismarck and Emperor William II . This article sparked off a wide 
discussion in the Social-Democratic press. The newspaper Vorwärts, in its editorials on 6,12,21 and 22 
July 1892 (Nos. 155,160,168,169) censured von Vollmar’s views.  
439. In 1867 Georg von Vollmar served as a volunteer in a detachment in the employ of the Papal States. 
440. On 12 December 1894 Wilhelm Liebknecht spoke in  the Reichstag in debates on the state budget for 
1895-96 and other bills. Liebknecht devoted most of hi s speech to the Subversion Bill (see Note 428) and 
to the issue of lèse-majesté (see Note 436). 
441. On 13 December 1894 Witold Jodko-Narkiewicz asked Engels for permission to translate his work The 
Peasant Question in France and Germany (present edition, Vol. 27) for the Polish journal Przedsmit. The 
translation was published in No. 12 of this journal for 1894. 
442. The archives of German Social-Democracy were set up in 1882 to preserve for posterity the manuscripts 
of figures prominent in the German working-class m ovement (including those of Marx and Engels), the 
literature on German history and the international working-class movement as well as related press 
publications. With the abrogation of the Anti-Socia list Law (see Note 15) these archives were moved 
from Zurich to Berlin. 
443. Marx died before completing the MS of his Theories of Surplus Value for publication; this work 
constituted a relatively independent part of a larger manuscipt dated 1861-63 (see present edition, Vols. 
30-34). Nor could Engels realize in his lifetime th e intention of publishing the Marxian manuscript as 
Volume IV of Capital. It was K. Kautsky who had The Theories of Surplus Value published in 1905-10. 
444. This letter was written on a postcard, with the follo wing address: Monsieur Pie rre Lavroff, 328, rue Saint 
Jacques, Paris - France. 
445. On 11 December 1894 the Italian Prime-Minister Giovanni Giolitti had to hand to the Parliament the 
documents on abuses in La Banca Romana (Roman Bank); (see Engels’ ar ticle ‘The Italian Panama, 
present edition, Vol. 27) whereupon a commission of inquiry was set up. 
446. Engels indicated the following address on the postcard on which the letter was written: G.W Lamplugh 
Esq., 28 Jermin St., S.W. 
447. Only an excerpt from this letter to Paul Singe r has come down; it was quoted in the article ‘Berlin 
Bierboykott’ published in the newspaper Vorwärts (No. 1) on 1 January 1895. 
448. The text of this letter without the opening greeti ng. The initial phrase is published in the present edition, 
Vol. 27, under the title ‘Message of Greetings to th e Austrian Workers on the Daily Publication of the 
Arbeiter-Zeitung.  
AA9. On 23 December 1894 Laura Lafargue told Engels that the newspapers Le Peuple (Lyon) and Réveil du 
Nord (Lille) of the French Workers’ Party w ould thereforth be daily publications.  
450. The Manifesto of the Communist Party was published in the monthly L’Ére nouvelle (Nos. 9-11) in 
September-December 1894. Laura Lafargue, who wanted to have it published as a separate pamphlet, 
asked Engels on 23 December 1894 for advice about the preface. The

596 Notes 
pamphlet that appeared in 1895 with the L’Ère nouvelle Publishers had the short prefatory note which had 
preceded the text of the first publication.  
By referring to the ‘four prefaces’ to the Manifesto Engels meant one, to the London German-
language edition of 1890; those to the German ed itions of 1872, 1883 and 1890, and probably the preface 
to the Russian edition of 1882 included into the preface of 1890.  
451. Alfred-Léon Gérault-Richard, a Blanquist, was the firs t to be convicted in keeping with the French law of 
July 1894 against the anarchists (see Note 383); he  received the maximum punishment—one year in 
prison and a fine of 3,000 francs fo r his article in the newspaper Le Chambard in which he attacked 
President Jean Casimir-Périer. Thereupon, on 6 Janua ry 1895, Blanquists nominated his candidacy in the 
13th constituency of Paris. Gérault-Richard was el ected to the Chamber of Deputies and set free. 
452. Engels wrote the following dedication to Victor Adler on the title page of Volume II I of Das Kapital: 
‘Seinem Victor Adler, London. 1/1.95 (‘To my Victor Adler, London. 1.1.95’). 
453. After the publication of Volume II I of Das Kapital in December 1894 Engels began preparations for 
republishing the earlier works written by Marx and himself, including those published by the New-York 
Daily Tribune in the 1850s. Therefore in January 1895 he resumed his correspondence with Ludwig 
Kugelmann who for many years had been collecting the works of Marx and Engels for his library. 
454. In September 1893, during his trip to the Europ ean continent, Engels had two meetings with L. 
Kugelmann in Berlin to discuss the planned publication of the works of Marx and Engels. 
455. As L. Kugelmann wrote to Engels on 7 January 1895, Hermann Meyer, who emigrated to America after 
the 1848 Revolution, had been collecting Marx’s works.  After Meyer’s death in a shipwreck in 1875, the 
books and other documents that still remained in his collection fell into the hands of his nephew, Max 
Livingston of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Having learne d of this, Kugelmann asked Lvingston to send on 
Marx’s works in his possession. Livingston replied in his letter on 21 March 1876 that he had only the 
articles and reports written by Marx for the New-York Daily Tribune in 1851-58 (see also Note 559). 
456. On 28 December 1894 L. Kugelmann wrote this to Engels: ‘Indicated in the list of ‘errata’ for Volume II I 
is also “page 352, line 13 from top”, but I have f ound none.—Will you not give the correct place in the 
Neue Zeit and Vorwärts?’  
457. In his letter to 11 August 1894 Hermann Schlüter as ked Engels to approach Eduard Bernstein with an 
invitation to contribute a series of articles on Volume II I of Das Kapital for the newspaper New-Yorker 
Volkszeitung (see also this volume, p. 345). 
E. Bernstein’s articles under the general title Der dritte Band des ‘Kapital’ appeared in Die Neue Zeit 
(13.Jahrgang, 1. Band, Nr . 11-14, 16, 17) in 1894-95.  
458. On 3 May 1894 the workers of Berlin brewerie s declared a ‘beer boycott’ to protest against 
the firing of about 300 coopers of the Ricksfor d Union of Brewers who had taken part in 
the May Day demonstrations of 1894. The brew ery workers pressed their demands for hav 
ing May 1 as a day off, for reducing the working day to 9 hours, a legal status for the trade- 
union organisations of brewers, an independent court of arbitr ation, and for the reinstate 
ment of the sacked workers with compensation for damages. The owners of large breweries 
responded by a mass lockout. However, since th e beer boycott attained a wide scope, in 
September 1894 the employers had to enter into  negotiations with the workers and meet 
their demands by and large. An arbitration c ourt, comprising representatives of employers 
and workers, was likewise set up. The beer boycott was stopped on 26 December 1894.

459. As Karl Kautsky wrote to Engels on 29 Decembe r 1894, Wilhelm Liebknecht had found the original of 
the letter Marx had written to Johann Baptist Schweitzer ; he also said that Liebknecht was going to offer it 
to Dietz Publishers for publication. However, Liebkn echt did not know that this letter had been published 
as an article—under the name  ‘On Proudhon’—by the newspaper Der Sozial-demokrat in February 1865 
(see present edition, Vol. 20). Kautsky also told E ngels he had found certain differences between the 
manuscript and the printe d text of the article. 
460. Probably a reference to Ernst von Köllers speech in the Reichstag on 15 December 1894. Speaking in the 
debates on court proceedings against W. Lie bknecht (see Note 436), von Köller advocated suffer 
disciplinary liability fo r Reichstag deputies. 
461. Engels mentioned A. Bebel’s speech in the Re ichstag on 15 December 1894 in the debates on bringing W. 
Liebknecht to court trial (see Note  436). Bebel drew attention to th e violation of Article 30 of the 
Constitution which prohibited court prosecution of deputies for statements made in the Reichstag. 
462. A reference to the constitutiona l conflict of February 1860 in Prussi a between the Prussian government 
supported by the Junkertum, on the one hand, and th e bourgeois majority of the lower house of the 
Prussian Landtag, on the other, over a ppropriations for army reorganisation. 
463. Writing to Engels on 26 November 1894, Paul Stumpf  voiced his apprehensions about the differences at 
the Congress of the German Social-Democratic Part y in Frankfurt am Main in October 1894 (see Note 
418) which, in his view, showed the inadequate  theoretical grounding of the young party members. 
464. A reference to the German People’s Party (D eutsche Volkspartei) founded in 1865; it comprised 
democratic elements of the petty bourgeoisie and to some extent thos e of some other strata of the 
bourgeoisie—for the most part from the southern Ge rman states. The German People’s Party opposed the 
Prussian hegemony in Germany and championed a Great  German Reich, so-called, which was to include 
Prussia and Austria. Although it steered anti-Prussian  policies and put forward democratic slogans, the 
People’s Party expressed at the same time the particular ist aspirations of the individual German states. It 
was against Germany’s unification into unified democratic republic. 
465. An allusion to the stay of Marx and Engels in  Mainz on 7-9 April 1848 en route from Paris to Cologne. 
While in Mainz, they met local members of the Comm unist League, including Paul Stumpf, to discuss the 
unification of workers’ associations for par ticipation in the German revolution of 1848. 
466. In his letter of 6 September 1894 Pasquale Martignetti as ked Engels to tell Edward Aveling that the 
attempt to publish in Italian his work The Student’s Marx had not come off. 
467. Martignetti’s Italian transl ation of the preface which Engels had writen to Volume II I of Capital was 
published in the journal Le Rassegna agraria, industrials, commercia le, letteraria, politica, artisticaNo.l/2 
for January 1895. 
468. A reference to the note written by Louise Fr eyberger (Kautsky)—’Aus den Trades-Unions’—and 
published by Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 15, 15 January 1895; signed: K.L.); also, to the anonymous report 
England, published by the same newspaper on 5 January 1895 (No. 5) in the feature Aus den 
Organisationen.

469. This dispatch by Louise Freyberger (Kautsky) about the report of Mrs. Crawford to the newspaper 
Weekly Dispatch on 6 January 1895 was published by Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 10) on 10 January 1895 
(signed: K.L.). 
470. In his letter to Engels on 27 December 1894 Victor Adler asked him to invite Emile Vandervelde as a 
correspondent for the Vienna newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A similar request was uttered with respect to 
Paul Lafargue as well (see Note 477). 
471. On 27 December 1894 Victor Adler wrote in his letter to Engels about his plans to have the Arbeiter-
Zeitung publish the article ‘Karl Marx in Wien’ and asked if  Engels could help him with the material for 
it. He also said he had found some  of the data in the newspaper Der Radikale published in 1848 by Alfred 
Julius Becher. 
On 24 January 1895, the Arbeiter-Zeitung published Max Bach’s article ‘Karl Marx in Wien” which 
drew upon the facts supplied by Engels (see also this volume, p. 434).  
472. An English excerpt from this letter was first published in Marx and Engels on Malthus. Edited by Ronald 
L. Meek, Lawrence and Wishart, London, 1953. 
473. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard with th e following address: Herrn Dr. L. Kugelmann, 20 BI 
Warmbüchenstr., Hannover, Germany. 
474. On 9 August 1848 the Prussian National Assembly approved the motion of one of the deputies, Julius 
Stein, whereby the War Mi nister Schreckenstein was to issue an order providing for a voluntary discharge 
of army officers opposing the constitutional aspirations of the people. Yet no such order was issued. On 7 
September 1848 Stein tabled his motion again and demanded an immediate vote on it. The proposal was 
adopted by 219 votes against 143; as a result, the Auerswald-Hansemann government had to tender its 
resignation. The Pfuel cabinet that succeeded did finally issue the order on 26 September 1848, but it 
remained on paper only. 
475. In the preface to Volume II I of Capital Engels took a critical view of  certain tenets of George 
Stiebeling’s work Das Werthgesetz und die Profit-Rate. Le ichtfaßliche Auseinandersetzung einiger 
wissenschaftlicher Fragen. Stiebeling’s letter was published in Die Neue Zeit, 13. Jg.1894-95, 1 Bd., No. 
18. 
476. Speaking on 7 January 1895 in the Reichstag de bates on the proposed Subve rsion Bill (see Note 428), 
Ignaz Auer argued there were no va lid motives for its introduction. 
477. P. Lafargue began to cooperate with the Arbeiter-Zeitung. His first article “Der ‘Panama Bazillus’” was 
published by this newspaper on 8 January 1895- 
478. A hint at the Reichstag speech on 10 January 1895 by the German War Minister General Bronsart von 
Schellendorff in the debate s on the Subversion Bill (Die Umsturzvorlage, see Note 428). He tried to 
validate the necessity of this legislation by pointi ng to the activity of ‘instigators’ who had to be 
combatted with the aid of law and right. 
479. Speaking in the Chamber of Deputies on 10 Ja nuary 1895, Etienne Millera nd proposed that Gérault-
Richard be released from prison (see Note 451) and demanded a broad discussion on the issue. But the 
Chairman of the Council of Ministers Charles D upuy opposed the Millerand proposal and put a vote of 
confidence on the agenda. The Millerand proposal wa s turned down by 294 votes against 205. Gérault-
Richard was pardoned only after the resi gnation of President Casimir-Périer. 
480. On 24 December 1894 Edouard Vaillant sent Engels  a number of draft laws on labour legislation and 
agrarian issues which Socialist depu ties had tabled in the Chamber of

Deputies. He asked Engels to pay particular attention to the draft law on agricultural communal holdings.  
481. Engels hints at a group of French Blanquist emigrés (E. Vaillant, Fr.-É. Cournet et al.) who, in June 1874, 
published in London the pamphlet Aux Communeux {On Communal Property).  
482. The daily La Petite République (before 1893, La Petite Republique Française) on 12 January 1895 
published an article by A.G. Rouanet; like the article of A.L. Gérault-Richard in Le Chambart (see Note 
451) it was directed against the President of the French Republic, Casimir-Périer. 
On 12 January 1895 Amand Rouanet, a Socialist deputy, made a proposal in the Chamber of Deputies 
providing for a cut in the pensions paid to the holder of the Legion d’honneur order; such pensions were 
not to exceed 1000 francs. The aim of this motion was to prevent arbitrary deco rations being conferred on 
all kinds of parvenus. Rouanet in timated, however, he had no hope for an unbiased voting on his proposal 
(Rouanet recalled the deputies had rejected the proposal on Gérault-Rich ard’s liberation). At this point the 
President of the Chamber of Deputies demanded that R ouanet leave the assembly hall, which he had to do 
in spite of protests from some of the deputies.  
483. Sang an Ägir —a musical composition by Emperor William II . 
484. Three successive French governments had to resi gn since November 1893: the Dupuy cabinet (November 
1893), the Casimir-Périer cabinet (May 1894) and then the Dupuy cabinet again (January 1895). 
Thereupon, on 15 January 1895, President Casimir-Périe r tendered his resignation; he was resolutely 
opposed by the Socialist faction in Parliament enjoin ing the French to defend the Republic ‘in jeopardy’. 
On 17 January 1895 François Félix Faure was elected President of the French Republic. 
485. The reference is to Laura Lafargue’s letter of  12-13 January 1895 about the testamentary dispositions 
which Engels had made concer ning Marx’s literary heritage. 
486. The French President Jean Casimir-Périer resi gned on 15 January 1895. The day before, the Chamber of 
Deputies had declined his proposal on the order of proceedings in the inquiry into the government’s 
involvement in major financial speculations (see Note 487). 
487. Late in 1894 the French Chamber of Deputies raised  the issue of the agreements concluded in 1883 by the 
government and the railroad company. These agreem ents gave the company virtually a free hand in 
speculation for as long as ten years; but the governme nt refused to revise them. Then, on 14 January 1895, 
Etienne Millerand proposed to look into  the matter and exposed the role David Raynal, the then Minister 
of Public Works, had played in that deal. The Ch amber approved this motion by 263 votes against 241. A 
parliamentary commission of inquiry  in 1896 found Raynal not guilty. 
488. The leader of the Radical Part y (see Note 86) Georges Benjamin Clem enceau had gained the reputation of 
a ‘government toppler’ for, as a result of his incessa nt interpellations in the Chamber of Deputies, the 
following cabinets had to resign: of Gambetta (1882) , Freycinet (1882), Ferry (1885) and Brisson (1885). 
By calling Clemenceau ‘the late’, Engels intimated th at the Radical Party had lost some of its former 
influence. 
489. A reference to the article La Situation by Jean Juarès which was published by the newspaper La Petite 
République (No. 6855) on 20 January 1895. Juarès proposed a package of the following reforms: pensions 
for industrial and agricultural workers at the expens e of factory and land owne rs; new shop regulations 
providing for worker participation in decision-maki ng; an institution of labour protection inspectors; 
worker profit-sharing at the enterprise

level; steps to improve soil fertility. In February 1894 he tabled a motion in the Chamber of Deputies for 
a state monopoly of grain imports with the aim of raising the grain prices.  
490. A reference to the following works of Ferdina nd Tönnies: ‘Neuere Philosophie der Geschichte: Hegel, 
Marx, Comte’ ( Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie, Bd. 7 for 1894) which disputed the tenets of P. 
Barths book Die Geschichtsphilosophie Hegels und der Hegelianer bis auf Marx und Hartmann; and 
Pestalozzi als Sozialpädagog {Sozialpolitisches Centralblatt, 3 December 1894). 
491. Comtism or positivism —a trend in philosophy, sociology and hi storiography that surfaced in the 1830s; 
its leading exponent was Auguste Comte, a French philosopher and sociologist. The positivists extended 
the methods of natural science to social studies. They viewed the historical process as slow evolutionary 
changes and denied the role of revolutions. 
492. This note to F. Tönnies’ article ‘Neuere Philosophi e der Geschichte: Hegel, Marx, Comte’ (see Note 490) 
says this in part: ‘Hervorragende englische Comtisten gehörten zu den Mitbegründern der 
“Internationale”, deren General-Sekr etär K. Marx war...’ (‘Illustrious  English Comtists were among the 
founders of the “International” the Secr etary-General of which was K. Marx’). 
493. The reference is to the statements in defense of the Paris Commune made in the press by positivists 
Edward Beesly and Frederick Harrison between Ma rch and September 1871. Thus, from March to June 
1871 The Bee-Hive Newspaper carried a series of articles by Prof essor Beesly; the opening article was 
entitled ‘On the Paris Revolution’. In May and August 1871 The Fortnightly Review published two big 
articles by Harrison in support of the Commune. 
494. The idea that besides working men, factory-owners  and merchants were also among the industrialists so-
called producteurs was formulated by Saint-Simon in his Catéchisme des industriels, published in Paris in 
1823-24. 
495. In his letter of 12 January 1895 Ludwig Kugelmann asked Engels for the names of German publications 
in which works by Marx and Engels had been publis hed, signed or unsigned (see also this volume, p. 
500). 
496. On 23 January 1895 Victor Adler wrote to Engels that the publication of the Arbeiter-Zeitung ‘was 
making very good progress’: as many as 14,000 copies were being printed daily instead of the planned 
10,000, while on Sundays the circ ulation reached 22,000 copies. 
497. Engels means the Liberal Party’s Right Wing akin to  the Conservatives and expr essing the interests of big 
industrial, commercial a nd financial bourgeoisie. 
In 1893 the Gladstone cabinet tabled a second edition of the draft Home Rule Bill (see Note 77) which 
riled the Liberal Party’s Right Wing. Having declar ed themselves ‘independent’, the Right-Wingers 
actually sided with the Conservatives.  
498. A reference to the second electoral reform of 1867 in Britain. Town resident s—house-owners and tenants 
who had been resident for not less than a year and whose annual rent was not under £10—received voting 
rights. In counties the property qualification was re duced to £12 of rent per annum. As a result, the 
number of eligible voters increased more than twof old (with voting rights being granted to part of 
industrial workers). 
499. Engels refers to an article in the Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 26) on 26 January 1895 in which the editors 
reported the confiscation of the paper’ s evening issue of 24 January and stat ed that since a larger part of 
the confiscated circulation had neve rtheless reached the subscribers, a repeated publication of the issue 
was not necessary.

500. This excerpt from Emily Crawford’s report in The Weekly Dispatch of 27 January 1895 was 
published by the Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 32) on 1 February 1895 in Louise Freyberger’s 
article ‘Zur Charakteristik  des neuen Präsidenten’. 
501. On 9 January 1895 the newspaper Vorwärts published an appeal of the Union of  Women’s 
Societies to the German women ‘of all classes and all parties’ urging them to sign a petition 
to the Reichstag and Landtags to concede wome n the right of association and assembly in 
those German lands where they had not yet this right. Writing in Vorwärts on 24 January 
1895, Clara Zetkin ran a sharp critique of this  appeal on the grounds that it lacked a class 
approach. She stressed that ‘the women’s questi on ought to be considered only in the context 
of the total social question’ and called on the proletarian women not to put their signatures 
on the petition. 
502. Engels indicated the following address on the envelope of this letter: Herren Dr. W. 
Ellenbogen. IX Wasagasse 22. Wien. 
503. Engels wrote these lines on a paper chit, and he gave the following address: Madame 
Beldinsky, 2, Regent’s Square, W.C. 
504. Zemstvo —elective district councils instituted in some provinces of European Russia in 
keeping with the local government reform of 1864. 
505. Engels means the statement made by the Russian Tsar Nicholas II  on 29 (17) January 1895 
at a reception for deputations of the Russian nobility, zemstvos (see Note 504) and town 
communities on the occasion of the royal marriage.  The tsar dismissed as ‘idle dreams’ the 
desire of some zemstvo representatives to participate ‘in the affairs of domestic government’ 
and gave it to understand he woul d ‘safeguard the autocracy principle as firmly and stead-
fastly as had his lamented parent’. 
506. The Comm ittee, set up to prepare the International Socialist Working-Men’s Congress due in 
London in 1896, suggested that henceforth it be  named as an International Congress of 
Socialist Working Men and Trade Unions. In this connection Tomasz Jodko-Narkiewicz, a 
Polish Socialist emigré, asked Engels in his letter of 31 January 1895 what he and German 
Social-Democrats thought of the suggestion. 
507. In his letter of 30 January 1895 Richard Fischer told Engels about the plans of Vorwärts to 
release in a separate edition a series of articles which Marx had written for Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung. Politische-ökonomische Revue in 1850 on the 1848-49 Revolution in France (see 
present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 47-131) and asked for his agreement to the proposed publica-
tion. He also asked him to write an introduction (see also Note 529). 
508. A reference to the fifth and sixth authorized ed itions of The Manifesto of the Communist 
Party published in Berlin in 1891 and 1894, respectively. 
509. The protocols of the Zurich C ongress were never issued by Vorwärts. They appeared in 
Zurich in 1894 under the title: Protokoll des Internationalen Sozialistischen Arbeiter-
kongresses in der Tonhalle Zürich vom 6. bis 12. August 1893.  
510. Après nous le déluge [‘After us, the deluge’]—a saying attr ibuted to Madame de Pompadour 
and addressed to King Louis XV of France. 
511. The final version of the text of the Introduction to Karl Marx’s The Class Struggles in France, 
1848 to 1850 (1895) contained no explanatory notes from Engels in it. 
512. The reference is to Richard Fischer’s sp eech in the Reichstag on 6 February 1895 during the 
debates on worker representation in settling moot issues among workmen and employers.

602 Notes 
Fischer criticised the social policies of the Centre Party (see Note 71) which did not go 
beyond demands for minor social concessions (like, for instance, granting recognition to 
working-men’s alliances), while leaving aside th e workers’ vital interests: shorter working 
hours, social insurance and guarant ees for freedom of association.  
513. Appended to this letter were the titles of the first three ch apters of Marx’s work The Class 
Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (see Note 507). Engels suggested changing the original 
titles ‘The Defeat of June 1848’ , ‘June 13, 1849’ and ‘Conseque nces of June 13, 1849’ (as 
given by Marx in Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politische-ökonomische Revue) for: I. ‘From 
February to June 1848’, II . ‘From June 1848 to June 13, 1849’, and II I. ‘From June 14,  
1849 to March 10, 1850’, respectively. As Chapter IV Engels suggested materials on the 
revolutionary events in France from ‘The Third International Review’ published by the 
Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Po litische-ökonomische Revue(No. 5-6) for 1850; he entitled this 
chapter ‘The Abolition of Univ ersal Suffrage in 1850’ (see pres ent edition, Vol. 10, pp. 47- 
145). The above work— The Class Struggles in France —was to be published as a separate 
booklet.  
514. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte used the decision by the French National Assembly in May  
1850 to abrogate universal suffrage, to seize power and impose dictatorial rule. Following 
the coup d’état of December 1851 he re-institute d universal suffrage in an election to the 
Legislative Corps.  
515. Engels indicated the following address on the envelope: Julius Motteler Esq., 30, Hugo 
Road, Tufnell Park, N. 
516. Acting on Engels’ request, J. Motteler had made i nquiries in Germany and, having received 
a letter from a Johann Meyer in which Theodor Barlen’s person was confirmed, sent it to 
Engels (see this volume, p. 452). 
517. Concerning the French translation of Engels’ work On the History of Early Christianity (see 
present edition, Vol. 27) made by Laura Lafargue (see also Note 420). 
518. A reference to the lecture L’Idéalisme de l’histoire which Jean Juarès delivered in Paris 
early in 1895. 
519. Stoicism —a philosophical system founded by Zeno and current in Ancient Greece between 
the late fourth century B.C. a nd the sixth century B.C. The St oics believed that all events 
were the result of divine will and that th erefore man should be calmly accepting and free 
from passion, grief or joy. 
520. Engels refers to Y. Zack’s article ‘Historical Materialism’, published in the first issue of the 
journal Russian Heritageïot 1895, and also to N.Mikhailovsky’s review ‘Literature and Life’, 
published by the above journal in 1894 (No. 1). 
521. In his letter to Engels on 20 February 1895, G. Plekhanov called N. Da nielson a ‘reactionary 
and Utopian, all in one’. 
522. Refers to Engels’ fifth article ‘On Social Relations in Russia’ (see present edition, Vol. 24, 
pp. 39-50) in the series Refugee Literature which, alongside the first and second articles, he 
included in the collection Internationales aus dem Volksstaat (1871-75), as well as to the 
Afterword (1894) which Engels had written for this coll ection (see present edition, Vol. 27, 
pp. 421-33). 
523. Writing to Engels on 20 Februa ry 1895, G. Plekhanov described Tsar Nicholas II  as ‘the 
young idiot of the Winter Palace’ whose speech  of 29 January 1895 ‘has done a great service 
to the revolutionary party’.

524. J. Motteier told Engels in his letter of 28 February 1895 that on 18 Febr uary he had been attacked in his 
house by two anarchists who had identified themselv es by false names— Alexander Cohen and Zimmer. 
525. National workshops-were set up by the Provisional Government of France immediately after the February 
Revolution of 1848 for jobless work ers, artisans, office employees, school teachers as well as petty 
entrepreneurs who were given meni al jobs at miserable wages. 
526. According to the local government reform on 1888, the London County Council could be elected by all 
male citizens who were eligible to vote in parlia mentary elections, as well as by women 30 years and 
older. The London County Council, which controlled taxation, local budge ts, etc., was elected every three 
years. The 1889 and 1892 elections brought victory to the Progressists, a group comprising bourgeois 
Liberals, members of the Fabian Society (see No te 43) and Socialists; it defeated the group of Moderates 
that united the Liberal Unionists (see Note 206) and the Conservatives. At the elections of 2 March 1895, 
the Moderates gained a few new seats in the London County Council because  of the refusal of the 
Socialists to vote in a bloc with the Progressists.  
527. Nikolai Danielson wrote in this letter that the passage in Engels’ preface to Volume II I of Capital about 
Marx’s research on Russian land ownership made him wa nt to find out if there were any notes written by 
Marx on this topic.  
528. In his letter to Engels of 10 March 1895 N. Dani elson enclosed a message to Andrei Konov, a Russian 
emigré in Berlin who undertook the translation. N. Danielson’s book Essays on Our Post-Reform Social 
Economy was translated by G. Polonsky and came out in Munich in 1899. 
529. On 6 March 1895 Engels received a letter from Rich ard Fischer, the Executive Secretary of the German 
Social-Democratic Party, who requested  him to soften what appeared to  be the stridently revolutionary 
tenor of the manuscript of the Introduction to Karl Marx’s The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 
(1895); R. Fischer feared the moot points would be ta ken advantage of by the enemies of Social-
Democracy, a making it easier for the government to  push through the Subversion Bill (see Note 428). 
Being obliged to fulfill the request of the Party’ s Executive Board, Engels agreed to make some 
amendments in the text and omit some of the passage s, e.g., ones dealing with the armed struggle which 
the proletariat was to wage against the bourgeoisie.  Engels admitted that the original text of the 
Introduction ‘suffered somewhat’ as a result of such deletions (see this volume, p. 480). 
530. May laws —the four laws adopted at Bismarck’s initiativ e in May 1873; they provided for strict state 
control over the activity of the Catholic Church . These laws marked th e culmination of the Kulturkampf  
(‘Struggle for Culture’) policy. 
531. Mennonites —an evangelical Protestant Christian sect  founded in the 1530s-1540s in Friesland by 
Anabaptists who, after the defeat of the Peasan t War of 1524-26 and the M ünster Commune of 1534-35, 
abandoned their revolutionary aspirations. Named after Menno Simons, the founder of this sect, 
Mennonites oppose the taking of oaths,  infant baptism, military serv ice, and the acceptance of public 
office; they favour plain dress and plain living. 
532. The movement for universal suffrage organised by the Social-Democrats gained new momentum in 
Austria in 1895 (see Note 270). There were 12 mass ra llies in Vienna on 19 Febr uary 1895, in support of 
this demand. The newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung carried regular reports by V. Adler on this matter. 
533. The English text of this letter was first published in K. Marx and F. Engels, Selected Correspondence, 
Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965.

604 Notes 
534. In May 1895 Engels wrote the article ‘Law of Valu e and Rate of Profit’ conceived as an 
addendum to Volume II I of Capital. It was published shortly after his death by Die Neue 
Zeit (14.jg., 1. Bd., Nos. 1,2 fo r 1895/96) under the heading: ‘Fr. Engels’ letzte Arbeit: 
Ergänzung und Nachtrag zum dritte n Buch des ‘Kapitals” (see present edition, Vol. 37).  
Engels intended to write yet another article , ‘The Stock Exchange ’, but could not go 
further than the general outline (see present edition, Vol. 37).  
535. The reference is to Peter Fireman’s article ‘Kr itik der Marx’schen Wer ttheorie’ published in 
the economic and statistical yearbook Jahrbücher für National ökonomie und Statistik for 
1892 (3. Folge, Bd. 3). Engels gave a positive a ppraisal of this article in his preface to 
Volume II I of Capital. However, Conrad Schmidt took exception to this assessment: writ-
ing to Engels on 1 March 1895, he said Firema n had only repeated what Professor Wilhelm 
Lexis had found before him. 
536. A reference to W Lexis’ article ‘Die Marx’sche Kapitaltheorie’ published in the yearbook 
Jahrbücher fur National ökonomie und Statistik (11 Bd. ) for 1885, and C. Schmidt’s book 
Die Durchschnittsprofitrate auf Grundlage des Marx’schen Wertgesetzes published in Stuttgart 
in 1889. 
537. The West Frankish Kingdom came into being after the disintegration of the Frankish Empire 
of Charlemagne (Charles the Great). According to the Verdun Treaty of 843, it was divided 
among Charlemagne’s three grandsons. The West Frankish Kingdom occupied a territory of 
roughly what is now France. 
538. Assises of Jerusalem (Assises de lérusalem)—a code of laws for courts in the Kingdom of 
Jerusalem established by the medieval crusader s after the First Crusade; this kingdom was in 
existence from the end of the eleven th to the late th irteenth century. 
539. A reference ot the two articles by Paul Lafar gue: ‘Breve risposta - domanda ai critici di Marx 
circa la teoria de valore’ and Replica di Lafargue published by Critica Sociale, Nos. 20 and 
22 on 16 October and 16 November 1894. 
540. The letters to P. Lafargue and A. Labriola have not been found. 
541. In his letter of 5 March 1895 K. Kautsky told Engels about J.  Platter’s critique of Volume II 
I of Capital in the Swiss journal on economic and social policy— Schweizerische Blätter für 
Wirtschafis- und Sozialpolitik (1. Märzheft, 1895)—under the title ‘Die Lösung’. Kautsky 
added he had declined E. Ferris offer for publica tion of his article in defence of the Marxian 
theory of value. 
542. In March 1895 Victor Adler, the editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, was sentenced to a seven-
week term in prison for the paper’s criticisms  of the Austrian government. He was incar-
cerated in the Vienna prison Rudolfsheim from 18 May to 18 June 1895. 
543. This is in reply to Carl H ackenberg’s letter to Engels of 8 March 1895 in which he asked for 
more information about the activities of Herma nn Becker, a German lawyer and journalist, 
in 1848-50; C. Hackenberg planned to write a biography of H. Becker. Probably unable to 
verify data on the events 45 y ears ago, Engels allowed hims elf some inaccuracies in his 
reply. 
544. With the outbreak of the 1848 Revolution in Germany Marx and Engels moved from Paris to 
Cologne where they arrived on 11 April 1848. On 15 April or thereabouts Engels set off on a 
tour of German towns and returned to Cologne on 20 May 1848. In 1848-49 H. Becker was 
one of the leaders of The Cologne Democratic Association (see Note 547). 
545. C. Hackenberg had asked Engels if H. Beck er had stayed put in Cologne in the spring of 
1848 or he had undertaken trips to ot her towns to propagandise his ideas. 
=====第631页=====
Notes 605 
546. C. Hackenberg had i nquired about H. Becker’s attitude to the Schleswig-Holstein issue.  
This issue, concerning the Danish duchies of  Schleswig and Holstein, became particularly 
acute during the Revolution of 1848-49. Backed by Prussia, the German population of these 
regions in March 1848 had begun a war of nationa l liberation against the Danish monarchy.  
547. The Cologne Democratic Association —formed in Cologne in April 1848; until April 1849 
Marx and Engels had been among its leadership. 
548. Der Kölner Arbeiterverein {The Cologne Workers’ Union) —a working-men’s assocation 
founded on 13 April 1848. Owing to the influen ce of Marx and Engels, it became a major 
centre of revolutionary activity involving working men and peasants. 
549. Engels means The Central March Association, named after the March 1848 Revolution in 
Germany. Founded in Frankfurt am Main at  the end of November 1848 by Left-Wing 
deputies to the Frankfurt National Assembly, it had branches in various German towns. 
550. The Neue Rheinische Zeitung never published any articles signed by H.B. 
551. Engels answers C. Hackenberg’s question whether he knew of the book Ungarns Fall, 
allegedly by H. Becker. 
552. The Westdeutsche Zeitung, published by H. Becker in Cologne, was launched on 25 May 
1849 immediately after the termina tion of the publication of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. 
Heinrich Bürgers did not take part in setting up the Westdeutsche Zeitung.  
553. The reference is to the Cologne Communist Trial when members of the Communist League 
were framed on the basis of forged evidence a nd perjury; they were accused of ‘conspiring’ 
against the Prussian state. The trial took pl ace in Cologne from 4 October to 12 November 
1852. Hermann Becker was among the defendants; he was sentenced to five years’ impris-
onment in a fortress (see this edition, Vol. 11: Marx, ‘Revelations Concerning the 
Communist Trial in Cologne’). 
554. In October 1894 Pablo Iglesias was sentenced to a fo rty-day term in prison for leading a 
strike action of Malaga textile workers. 
This strike broke out in the first half of  October 1894 at the textile mills of Marquis 
Larios in protest over the decision of the en trepreneurs to disband the Textile Workers’ 
Union and punish 19 workers active in it. The four thousand strikers were joined by workers 
in other cities, Madrid included. The Spanish So cialist Workers’ Party, led by P. Iglesias, 
captained the movement of Spanish workers in  support of the Malaga strike. Despite the 
intervention of the government which sided with  the factory-owners, the 80-day strike action 
ended in a workers’ victory. P. Iglesias appealed  to Engels with a request to help in rallying 
British working men and Socialis t organisations to support of the striking Spanish workers.  
555. Wr iting to Engels on 16 March 1895, Carl Hirsch asked to review the four articles he had 
written for Das sozialpolitisches Centralblatt: i) ‘Intensifikation der Arbeit und Verkürzung 
der Arbeitszeit’, published on 8 January 1894—No . 15; ü) ‘Intensifikation der Arbeit und 
ihr Widerstand’, published on 19 February  1894—No. 21; üi) ‘Die ökonomische und die 
sozialpolitische Schätzung der Arbeitskraft’ , published on 14 January 1895—No. 16; and 
iv) ‘Die Verdichtung der Arbeit unter sozi al-politischem Gesichtspunkt,’ published on 18 
February 1895—No. 21. C. Hirsch wanted to have these articles published as a separate 
booklet.

556. Refers to the by-election to the Reichsta g in Cologne, due on 13 May 1895. It was between 
Franz Lütgenau, a Social-Democrat, and Adolf Greiß, representing the Centre Party. A. 
Greiß won. 
557. The Col ogne-published newspaper Rheinische Zeitung which, in 1894-95, was edited by 
Carl Hirsch. 
558. Ludwig Kugelmann had been  looking for the earlier writings by Marx and Engels for the 
publication of a complete collection of their works (see Note 453). In July 1846 the journal 
Das Westphälische Dampfboot had published, anonymously, Marx’s and Engels’ Circular 
Against Kriege (see present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 35-51); and in August and September 1847 it 
had published Chapter 4 of the second volume of The German Ideology. ‘Karl Grün: Die 
Soziale Bewegung in Frankreich und Belgien (Darmstadt, 1845) or ‘The Historiography of 
True Socialism’ (see present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 484-531). 
559. L. Kugelmann, acting on Engels’ request in c onnection with the preparation of a complete 
collection of Marx’s works for the press (see this volume, p. 504), got in touch with Max 
Livingston. On 21 March 1895 Kugelmann informed  Engels of Livingstons reply: 18 years 
before he had commissioned Friedrich Sorge to  send Hermann Meyer’s heritage (see Note 
455) to London. 
560. Wilhelm Liebknechts speech  in the Reichstag on 2 Marc h 1895 during the debates on the 
budget committee s report on appropriations for the maintenance of the army. Liebknecht 
spoke out for a dissolution of the regular army  and setting up instead militia-type forces after 
the Swiss model. 
561. A reference to the book Die Vorläufer des Neuren Sozialismus which appeared in 1895 as the 
first volume of Die Geschichte des Sozialismus in Einzeldarstellungen published in Stuttgart 
by K. Kautsky, E. Bernstein, P. Lafargue, F.  Mehring and others. The first part of Volume 
I—Von Plato bis zu den Wiedertäufern —was written by K. Kautsky; the second part 
includes contributions by K. Kautsky, P. La fargue, C. Hugo as well as E. Bernstein’s 
Kommunistische und demokratisch-sozialistis che Strömungen während der englischen 
Revolution des 17.Jahrhunderts.  
562. The Anabaptists (lit., those baptised again) belonged to  one of the most radical and demo-
cratic religious-philosophical trends in Swit zerland, Germany and the Netherlands during the 
Reformation. This sect denied the vailidity of infant baptism a nd practised baptism of adults. 
563. Die Taboriten —the title of the sixth chapter of  Part II I of the Kautsky work Von Plato bis 
zu den Wiedertäufern. The Taborites (so called after their camp in  the town of Tabor in 
Bohemia)—a radical trend in the Hussite move ment. In contrast to the Calixtines, they 
formed a revolutionary, democratic wing of th e Hussites; their demands reflected the striv-
ing of the peasantry and the urban lower cla sses to put an end to feudal oppression and all 
manifestations of social and political injustice. 
564. The Reichstag at its sessi on on 23 March 1895 rejected, by 163 votes against 146, the pro-
posal to send a message of greetings to Bi smarck on the occasion of his 80th birthday. 
Voting against were Social-Democrats, deputies of the Free-Thinking Party, the Centre 
Party, those representing the Polish lands, and others. This decision aroused the anger of 
Emperor William II  who sent a cable to Bi smarck expressing his profound indignation over 
the incident; he said the Reichstag decision was ‘in gross contradiction to the feelings of all 
German princes and their peoples’.

565. In D ecember 1878 Bismarck proposed a draft reform  of customs tariffs to a Reichstag 
commission set up for the purpose. Following debate s in the Reichstag, this bill was adopted 
on 12 July 1879. It provided for a substantial increase in the customs duties on imports of 
iron, machinery, textiles, grain,  cattle, fats, flax, timber, etc. 
566. The Centre Party (see Note 71). 
567. A reference to P. Lafargue’s work Origine et évolution de la propriété which came off the press 
in Paris in 1895. At the publisher’s suggestion, it appeared under the same cover as Ives 
Gugot’s work Réfutation de l’essai sur l’origine de la propriété which refuted P. Lafargue’s 
conclusions. 
568. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in K. Marx, Selected Works. In two 
volumes. Vol. 2, International Publishers, New York, 1936. 
569. On 30 March 1895 the newspaper Vorwärts carried the leading article ‘Wie man heute 
Revolutionen macht’ which cited, without prior consent from Engels, selected excerpts from 
his ‘Introduction’ to Marx’s work The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850. The aim was 
to represent Engels as a prota gonist of an exclusively peaceful  takeover of political power by 
the working class. 
Shortly before the appearance of this work in a separate edition, the ‘Introduction’ had 
been published in the journal Die Neue Zeit (13. Jg., 1894/95, 2. Bd., Nr. 27, 28) in the same 
form as in the separate edition (see Note 529). The original version did not see print even 
after the threat of a new Anti-Soci alist Law in Germany had been over.  
570. Engels means Ein Wort des ‘Adressaten’ —the introduction which Julius Wolf wrote to F. 
Bertheau’s book Fünf Brief über Marx an Herrn Dr. Julius Wolf published in Jena in 1895. 
In his Introduction J. Wolf replied to Engels’ critical remarks on his address in the preface to 
Volume II I of Capital (see present edition, Vol. 37). 
571. The draft of this letter was wr itten on the blank part of a page of Harry Quelch’s letter to 
Engels of 1 April 1895- H. Quelch asked Engels for an interview about the contemporary 
condition of the working class in the May issue of the newspaper Justice.  
572. An English excerpt from this le tter was first published in: K. Marx, Selected Works. In two 
volumes. Vol. 2, New York, 1936. The full Englis h text of the letter appeared in Frederick 
Engels, Paul and Laura Lafargue. Correspondence, Vol. 3, 1891-95, Moscow, [1963]. 
573. An allusion to P. Lafargue’s book Le droit à la paresse. Réfutation du ‘Droit au travail’ de 
1848, published in Paris in 1883. 
574. This chapter of P. Lafargue’s work Origine et évolution de la propriété bore the title 
‘Collectivisme consanguin’. 
575. Lex Alamannorum (The Law of the Alamanni)—part of the Leges Alamannorum, or the 
records of the common law code of the Alama nni (Alemanni), the Germanic tribes which 
invaded and settled in Alsace and part of Sw itzerland in the early 5th century A.D. The 
Alamannic laws, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries A.D., reflected the transition from the 
primitive tribal system to early feudal society. 
576. Lex Salica (Salic Law)—a code of laws of Germ anic tribes, including the Salian Franks. 
Recorded in the early 6t h century A.D., this code reproduces  various stages of archaic court 
proceedings and is regarded as an important historical document illustrative of the evolution 
of Frankish society from the primitive comm unal system to nascent feudal society. The 
Salians were a tribe of Franks  who settled along the Ijssel River, in the Netherlands, in the 
4th century A.D.

577. On 3 April 1895 Richard Fischer told Engels—who ha d begun preparing for publication of 
the early works of Marx from the newspaper Rheinische Zeitung —that Hans Baake, a 
German Socialist, was planning a similar edition. Baake’s plans never materialised. 
578. A reference to the following article s written by Marx a nd published by the Rheinische 
Zeitung in 1842-early 1843: Proceedings of the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly. First Article. 
Debates on Freedom of the Press and Publication of the Proceedings of the Assembly of the 
Estates; Proceedings of the Sixth Rhine Assemb ly. Third Article. Debates on the Law on Thefts 
of Wood; Justification of the Correspondent from the Mosel (present edition, Vol. I, pp. 132-
81, 224-63, 332-58). Engels never realised his in tention to have these articles published in a 
separate edition. 
579. Engels alludes to Boris Krichevsky, a Russian  Socialist, who, wit hout his consent, had pub-
lished in 1894 the Russian translation of Marx’s works The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte and Wage Labour and Capital (see note 368). This publication was undertaken in 
the series ‘Social-Democratic Li brary’ (original in Russian). 
580. Engels had stayed in Berlin  on 16-28 September 1893 (see Note 262). 
581. This letter was first published in English in: K. Marx, F. Engels, Letters on ‘Capital’, 
London, 1983. 
582. N. Baudeau’s work Explication du t ableau économique published in 1846 in the book 
Physiocrates. Avec une introduction sur la doctrin e des physiocrates, des commentaires et des 
notices historiques, par E. Daire. 
583. Refers to the royalties for Marx’s The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850, published in 
Berlin in 1895. Engels had written an in troduction to this edition (see Note 507). 
584. By the Mosel article (subsequently, the Mosel articles) Engels means the Marx article 
‘Justification of the Correspondent from the Mosel’ published in January 1843 in five num-
bers of Rheinische Zeitung. Marx had planned five parts of this article (see present edition, 
vol. I, p. 334); however, only two parts had been written and published (ibid., pp. 334-58). 
585. In his letter to Engels on 27 January 1894 R.  Fischer proposed that works by Marx and 
Engels should be published in installments. In  his opinion, this did not exclude the possi-
bility of a complete collection of wo rks, as Engels had contemplated. 
586. The second German edition of volume I of Das Kapital was published in 1872-73 in nine 
installments. Marx wrote an af terword to the entire edition. 
587. Marx had been writing articles for New-York Daily Tribune from August 1851 to 1862 at the 
suggestion of the paper’s editor Charles Da na. A significant number of contributions, 
especially on military matters, were written by Engels at Marx’s request. Some of the dis-
patches were co-authored by Marx and Engels . The articles which Marx and Engels wrote 
for New-York Daily Tribune have been published in volumes 11-17 of the present edition. 
588. On 14 April 1895 Vorwärts published a note entitled ‘Parteipre sse’ informing readers about 
the changes in Le Socialiste: the larger format of this periodical, the appointment of A. 
Zévaés as editor-in-chief and of René -Auguste Chauvin as managing editor. 
589. At Engels’ request Laura Lafargue told him in detail about the characters in Molière’s plays 
in her letter of 6 April 1895. Engels showed an interest in Sganarelle  in view of Achille 
Loria’s theory that he personified vulgar common sense. 
590. The reference is to ‘true socialism’, a trend that gained wide currency in Germany in the 
1840s, chiefly amongst the petty bourgeois inte llectuals.  Critical of capitalism, True

Notes 609 
Socialists idealised the pre-capitalist way of life (med ieval guilds, etc.) and be lieved Germany could reach 
socialism without passing through the stage of capitalis t industry. True Socialists would hold forth on 
friendship and solidarity, and preach against partic ipation in political activity and the struggle for 
democracy; they denied the necessity of a bourgeois- democratic revolution in Germany. The views of 
‘True Socialists’ were sharply criticised by Marx and Engels.  
591. Writing to Engels on 21 March 1895, Ludwig Kuge lmann suggested publishing a complete collection of 
works by Marx and Engels, begi nning with articles published in Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher and 
The Manifesto of the Communist Party .  
592. Probably a reference to the copy of Marx’s The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 the receipt of 
which L. Kugelmann acknowledged in his reply letter to Engels on 14 July 1895. 
593. Some of the data given by Engels in this and in the preced ing paragraph and referring to his curriculum 
vitae are erroneous: he was in Bonn af ter 8 October 1842, the day when he had completed his military 
service in Berlin; Marx left  the editorial board of the Rheinische Zeitung on 17 March 1843, and his 
statement to this effect was published in  the newspaper on 18 March 1843. The ban on Rheinische 
Zeitung of 1 April 1843 was issued on 21 January 1843 with  the adoption, on 19 January of the same 
year, of the decision by the Prussian government to close down the newspaper; this decision was 
published in the Kölnische Zeitung on 26 January and in the Düsseldorfer Zeitung on 27 January 1843. 
Marx left Cologne for Bad-Kreuznach in May 1843. 
594. On 18 April 1895 the Berlin Polizei-Präsidium imposed censorship over th eatrical performances of Die 
Freie Volksbühne Gesellschaft (see Note 256). Its steering committee replied by stopping performances 
altogether, while its president, Fr anz Mehring, appealed to the cour t and demanded the defence of the 
right of free expression. Since the court had rejected  this plea, the Free Popular  Stage Society disbanded 
in March 1896, but it was reinstituted in the spring of 1897 with a new charter. 
595. Engels refers to the copies of the two articles written by Marx for the Rheinische Zeitung in 1842: 
‘Debates on Freedom of the Press and Publication of th e Proceedings of the Assembly of the Estates’, and 
‘Debates on the Law on Thefts of Wood’—the c opies which R. Fischer sent him on 6 May 1895. 
596. Engels stayed at Eastbourne from early June to 24 July 1895. 
597. This is in reply to the message from Hugo Heller,  a bookseller in Vienna, in which he informed Engels 
that a Vienna publisher, Ign az Brand, had sent him the C zech translation of Marx’s Wage Labour and 
Capital.  
Engels wrote this letter on a postcard, indicating the following address: Herrn Ignaz Brand Exped. 
Wiener Volksbuchhandlung VI, Gumpendorferstraße 8. Wien, Austria.  
598. On 15 May 1895 Carl Hirsch, then cooperating with the Rheinische Zeitung, told Engels about criminal 
charges being brought against A. Hofrichter, the ma naging editor of that newspaper. The criminal 
proceedings had been instituted by Sc hellmann, the superinte ndent of a reformatory at Braunweiler, since 
the newspaper had accused him of intensifying the inma tes’ work. The editors as ked Engels to find James 
Politt, a British journalist who had, at the request of  British factory-owners, visited a number of German 
prisons, including one at Braunw eiler, and had described his impressions in the newspaper The 
Hardwareman. The Rheinische Zeitung editors wanted Politt as a witness at the trial. 
599. Engels had written the rough copy of this letter somewhat earlier, on 12 May 1895.

610 Notes 
600. In his letter of 6 May 1895 to Engels, K. Kautsky asked him to write a section on the First 
International for Volume IV of Die Geschichte des Sozialismus in Einzeldarstellungen; this 
volume was to come out in 1897. 
601. In his reply to Engels on 25 May 1895 K. Kaut sky wrote that he and E. Bernstein had not 
asked Engels for contributions to Die Geschichte des Sozialismus only because in the winter 
of 1893-94 he, Engels, had been busy preparing the manuscript of Volume II I of Capital for 
the press. 
602. In his work Von Plato bis zu den Wiederstäufern K. Kautsky had translated Ulrich von 
Hutten’s Epistolae obscurorum virorum as Briefe unberühmter Manner, like Johannes Janssen, 
the author of Die Geschichte des deutchen Vol kes set dem Ausgang des Mittelalters, Kautsky 
believed the accepted translation of the Epistolae’s name was not clear enough. 
603. In 1890-95 Friedrich Adolf Sorge had written a series  of articles for the journal Die Neue 
Zeit on the labour movement in the United States in a period from the 1830s to 1892: ‘Die 
Arbeiterbewegung in den Vereinigten Staaten’.  As far back as 21 November 1891 Engels 
had suggested that these articles should be pub lished in a separate edition and had promised 
to find a publisher (see present edition, vol . 46). However, this publication did not 
materialise at the time. A book of his article s in Russian translation appeared in St. 
Petersburg only in 1907, i.e., after Sorge’s death (1906). 
604. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard a nd gave the following address: Herrn Richard 
Fischer, Buchhandlung des Vorwärts, Beuthstr. 2, Berlin, Germany. 
605. A. Hofrichter probably intended to have these articles reprinted in the Rheinische Zeitung.  
606. Concerning the additions and alterations for the revised German translation of Nikolai 
Danielson’s book Essays on Our Post-Reform Social Economy (original in Russian). The 
author had sent these corrections enclosed in  his letter to Engels of 1 June 1895 for A. 
Konov, the translator. 
The German edition of this book appeared only in 1899 in G. Polonsky’s translation.  
607. The reference is to Engels’ work What Have the Working Classes to Do with Poland (present 
edition, Vol. 20) which, translated into Polish, was published by the journal Przedswit (No. 
7) in July 1895 under the title: Klasa robotnicza a rwestya polska.  
608. Engels wrote the following a ddress on the envelope of the le tter: Sig. avv° Filippo Turati, 
23, Portici Galleria V.E. Milano, Italy. The fi rst page of the letter has the note written by 
F.Turati: ‘Riferito al Arturo  Labriola. 1.7.95’ (‘Told Ar turo Labriola, 1.07.95’). 
609. On 19 June 1895 E Turati asked Engels for perm ission to allow Arturo Labriola to make a 
précis of Capital for publication in Italian. 
610. In the article ‘Un fatto personale che info lge una questione generale’, published under the 
pseudonym Noi (‘We’) in the Critica Sociale (No. 10) on 16 May 1895. E Turati reproduced 
a passage from the letter which Engels had written on 8 January 1895 to Pasquale 
Martignetti (see this volume, pp. 407). Writing to Engels on 1 July 1895, E Turati apolo-
gised for not having indicated th e author of the passage quoted. 
F. Turati wrote the above article in reply to A. Labriola’s articles on the situation in Italy, 
which were published anonymously on 3 and 7 May 1895 by the Liepziger Volkszeitung. In 
them Labriola had criticised the stand of the Italian Socialist Party at a parliamentary elec-
tion (see Note 611).  
=====第637页=====
Notes 611 
611. At the election to the Italian Parliament on 26 May and 2 June 1895, the Italian Socialist Party, which had 
joined in a coalition with the Radicals and Republican s against the Crispi government and its supporters, 
gained 17 seats in the Parliament. 
612. Engels wrote these lines on a postcard showing a vi ew of the Eastbourne beach. Laura Lafargue wrote the 
following address on this card: Monsieur  Paul Lafargue, Le Perreux, Siene, France.  
613. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard to the fo llowing address which he indicated on it: Herrn Richard 
Fischer, Buchhdlg. des Vorwärts, Beuthstr. 2, Berlin S.W. 19; Germany. 
614. In April 1895 the Paris monthly journal Le devenir social carried Edward Aveling’s article ‘Les sans-
travail en Engleterre’ in which he claimed that Keir  Hardie, the leader of the Independent Labour Party, 
denied the fact of unemployment in Brita in. In June 1895 the French youth monthly La jeunesse socialiste 
reprinted excerpts from this artic le. On 6 July 1895 the journal Labour Leader carried a refutation from K. 
Hardie. 
615. Engels wrote these lines on a postcard and indicated  the following address: Ed. Bernstein, Esq., 29, Red 
Lion Square, W.C. London. 
616. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard to the follo wing address: Mrs. Aveling,  Greenstreet Green, near 
Chislehurst, Kent.  
617. Apparently a reference to the proposal made to E. Aveling in June 1895 by the Glasgow organisation of 
the Independent Labour Party (see Note 114) to nominat e his candidacy at the forthcoming parliamentary 
election. Aveling declined for reason of poor health. This was reported in The Labour Leader (No. 67) on 
13 July 1895 (see Note 614). 
618. A reference to the work of Eleanor Marx-Aveling translating into  English the French edition of G. 
Plekhanov’s pamphlet Anarchism and Socialism’ (ori ginal in Russian). The English edition, to which 
Eleanor wrote a preface, was published in London in 1895. 
619. This letter was written on a postcard with a view of  Eastbourne. Engels gave th e following address: Sig. 
Filippo Turati, Portici Galleria V.E. 23, Milano, Italy. 
620. A reference to the first part of A. Labriola s article ‘En memoire du Manifeste du parti communiste’ 
published by Le Devenir social (No. 3) in June 1895; the second part of this article appeared in the next, 
July issue of the journal. 
621. This letter, discovered in the late 1970s in the Nati onal Archives of Classic German Literature at Weimar, 
opens the correspondence of Engels with Arnold Ruge , a German journalist. Their first meeting took 
place in late March 1842 in Berlin where Engels was doing his military service. The present letter sheds 
additional light on Engels’ little-known article on Dante which Engels me ntioned in his second letter to 
Ruge on 15 June 1842 (see present edition, Vol. 2,  p. 543), an article which has not survived. 
622. A. Ruge complied with this request. In a review published by the Deutsche Jahrbücher fur Wissenschaft 
und Kunst (Nos. 126-128) on 28, 30 and 31 May 1842 he praised Engels’ work Schelling and Revelation. 
Ruge stressed in particular the au thor’s clarity in his exposition and critique of the Schelling philosophy. 
623. Engels means Ludwig Feuerbach’s Das Wesen ses Christenthums.  
624. Marx refers to the brochure written by A. Ruge and O. Wigand: An die Hohe Zweite Kammer der 
Sächsischen Ständeversammlung. ‘Complaint against the suppression of the journal Deutsche Jahrbücher 
fur Wissenschaft und Kunst, as ordered by the High Ministry for the Interior and carried out on 3 January 
1843’). The Rheinische Zeitung did not publish

612 Notes 
this pamphlet; however, the supplements to No. 71 and 73 and 12 and 14 March, 1843, 
respectively, carried Pfützer’s review (Pfü tzer was the paper’s Dresden correspondent): II ber 
die Broschüre an die Hohe Zweite Kammer der Sächsischen Ständeversammlung.  
625. Marx—at the time editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung —wrote this letter in reply to 
Friedrich Kapp, a German National-Liberal,  who was copperating with the newspaper, 
about the delay in the payment of royalties that  were due to him. Acting on Marx’s advice, 
on 11 December 1848 Kapp presented a promissory  note to the newspaper, but it was not 
paid. Later Marx reimbursed the required sum to him. 
626. Marx wrote the address on the envelope: M. Fr. Kapp. Paris. Avenue Breutell 28. 
627. This letter was first published in the Catalogue de la vente a l’Hôtel Drouot le 16 novembre 
1893 with a note attached to it that Marx had addressed the letter to ‘son collaborateur et 
secrétaire Reinländer’. It must have been George Friedric h Rheinländer, a German salesman 
in 1850s-1860s, who then emigrated to London. 
628. The present letter was addressed to Philip  Stephen King, the ow ner of a London bookselling 
firm that dealt in official government publi cations, draft bills, statistical reports and 
communications from academic and state institutions overseas. In the 1860s, 1870s and 
1880s Marx approached King on several occasions  with a request to send reference litera-
ture to him (see also present edition, Vols. 42, 43). 
629. Engels made his will already in Marx’s life time, bequeathing all his property to Marx. After 
Marx’s death Engels drew up another will accord ing to which all his property was divided in 
equal shares among Marx’s daughters Laura and Eleanor, the children of Jenny (the 
deceased daughter of Marx) and He lene Demuth, Marx’s housemaid. 
630. Lincoln’s Inn {Inn of Court) —one of the four London legal societies with the exclusive right 
to admit persons to practice at the bar. 
631. This document is reproduced from the copy made by E. Bernstein and Louise Freyberger 
(Mrs. Kautsky), with the following postscript which A. Bebel wrote on the envelope: ‘The 
letter with codicils, dated 14 November 1894, to  Engels’ Testament. Lay in the drawer of 
Engels’ desk’. 
632. This letter is a limerick jotted down by an  unknown person. Engels signed his name with a 
pencil. First published in English in the German  edition of the works of Marx and Engels: K. 
Marx, F. Engels, Werke, Bd. 38. Berlin, 1968. 
633. These lines were written by Louise Kautsk y (Freyberger) on a postcard. Engels wrote the 
following address: Mrs. Natalie Liebknech t, 160, Kantstraße, Charlottenburg Berlin. 
634. In that letter Isaak Hourwich, a Russian ec onomist living in the United States, told Engels 
about the forthcoming Russian-la nguage publication of his work The Economics of the 
Russian Village and asked him to supplement it with an appendix of the notes which Marx 
had made from Russian statisical books. 
635. Hermann Engels wrote this draft with a pencil on the back of L. Siebold’s letter to F. Engels 
of 22 July 1895. 
This letter must have been rewritten in a fair  copy by Louise Frey berger (Mrs. Kautsky) 
and sent to L. Siebold.  
636. The reference is to L. Siebold’s letter of 22 April 1895 in which he asked for Engels’ 
opinion concerning the publication of sketches on the history of chemistry from C. 
Schorlemmer’s literary remains (see Note 312).
