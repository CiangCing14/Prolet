Preface 
Volume 46 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick 
Engels contains letters dating from January 1880 to March 1883. It 
was during these last few years of Marx's life that Engels assumed the 
main burden of corresponding with leaders of the international wor­
king-class movement. 
Marx concentrated on his economic research; he also studied the 
history and culture of primitive society, world history, agriculture 
and peasant conditions in different countries, notably socio-economic 
relations and the state of the peasant commune in Russia after the 
abolition of serfdom. He also pursued his interest in higher mathema­
tics and collected new facts for Capital. His plans to complete Capital, 
however, were not destined to be realised by him. His health deterio­
rated rapidly, compelling him to devote much time to medical treat­
ment and often live out of London. Deprived of his library, he could 
not work on the second and third volumes of  Capital  (see this volume, 
pp. 158, 161) and even failed to finish reading the proofs of the third 
German edition of the first volume (pp. 425, 434). All this is reflected 
in this volume. 
Responding to Paul Lafargue's request and prompted by the vital 
need of the workers' movement, Engels in this period wrote Socialism: 
Utopian and  Scientific  (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 281-325), desti­
ned to become the most widely read Marxist book alongside the 
Manifesto of  the Communist Party. 
Socialism: Utopian and  Scientific,  produced in the spring of 1880, was 
based on three chapters of Anti-Diihring. The introduction to the

XVIII Preface 
French edition was written by Marx and published over the signature 
of Paul Lafargue (see pp. 16, 332). The pamphlet played a conspicuous 
role in imparting the Marxist outlook to the French socialists. 
'...I have seen what a regular revolution the thing has wrought in the 
minds of many of the better people in France,' wrote Engels 
(p. 300). This encouraged Engels to prepare a separate German 
edition (1882). To make it more comprehensible to factory workers 
(pp. 335, 352, 369), he revised the text, added a few new passages, 
and wrote a special preface (p. 331). An essay on the history of lan-
downership in Germany from the ancient commune to the 1870s, 
'The Mark (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 439-56), was appended. 
The essay, which later appeared under separate cover, entitled, 
Der deutsche  Bauer. Was war  er? Was er ist? Was  könnte er  sein?,  complet­
ed Engels' research of 1881-82 into the social system of the ancient 
Germans. Its inclusion as a supplement in the German-language edi­
tion of  Socialism:  Utopian and Scientific was meant to arouse the Ger­
man Social-Democrats' interest in the peasantry as the working class's 
potential ally. The importance Marx and Engels attached to this is 
reflected in Engels' letter of  23 September 1882, urging Bebel to read 
up on the subject, thus gaining 'solid foundations to go on in any deb­
ate [in the Reichstag] about landownership or agrarian questions' 
(p. 336). 
Engels tried to resume his study of the philosophy of natural sci­
ence he had begun in 1873 and dropped owing to his work on Anti-
Duhring (see present edition, Vol. 25). But only short spells of time 
were available to him, though, as he put it, the book (Dialectics of 
Mature),  'has also long been pending' (p. 350). He managed to write 
a few fragments in 1880-82 (see Vol. 25, p. 660). The problems raised 
in Dialectics of  Mature,  and the history of primitive society which En-
gels studied in the early 1880s, were only partly reflected in his letters 
of that period. 
By the 1880s, socialist workers' parties had sprung up in Austria, 
France, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and the United States 
of America. The emergence of national working-class parties was an 
objective trend that had begun in the 1860s. The letters in this vol­
ume produce a fairly good cumulative picture of the help that Marx 
and especially Engels had given them in drawing up their pro­
gramme and in their strategy and tactics.

Marx and Engels took the emergence of self-dependent national 
working-class parties as a sign of the times. They were critical of the 
untimely attempts at re-establishing the International and working 
out a single legislative political and economic programme for all 
countries where socialists could come to power. Since the matter had 
been put on the agenda of the impending international congress in 
Switzerland, called on the initiative of the Belgian socialists, the 
Dutch Social-Democrat Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis requested 
Marx in January 1881 to give his opinion on this score. 
The reply to Nieuwenhuis (see p. 61) and Engels' letter to Johann 
Philipp Becker of February 10, 1882, stressed it would be not only 
useless but also harmful to restore the International or hold interna­
tional congresses at the time 'in so far as they do not relate to the im­
mediate, actual conditions obtaining in this or that specific nation' 
(p. 67). The formation of mass socialist parties was still far from com­
pleted. Indeed, it had only just begun in some countries, so that 
a new, 'reorganised International ... would only give rise to fresh per­
secution' (p. 196). As Marx and Engels saw it, international contacts 
between socialist organisations were then, in fact, maintained 
through the socialist and workers' press, and through contacts be­
tween recognised workers' leaders (see p. 197). This meant new ways of 
consolidating the workers' international unity were coming to the 
fore.  Not until later, when the workers' movement attained a higher 
level and the ideas of scientific socialism spread, would the ground be 
ready for 'the establishment of an official, formal International' 
(p. 198). 
Marx's and Engels' contacts with the German working-class move­
ment were especially strong. The Socialist Workers' Party of Ger­
many was then the largest proletarian political organisation in the 
world. It had proved its viability despite the difficult climate created 
by the Anti-Socialist Law of October 1878. Continuously persecuted, 
it managed to maintain its membership, establish an underground 
organ, the newspaper Sozialdemokrat, in Switzerland, and to keep 
alive its contacts with the masses. 
The letters in this volume give a good idea of the diversity of 
Marx's and Engels' aid to the German Social-Democrats. They urged 
them to combat the reformist sentiment introduced by bourgeois 
intellectuals who, admitted to the party before the enactment of the

XX Preface 
Anti-Socialist Law, opposed the revolutionary tactics of the left wing, 
and tried, as Engels wrote, 'to get rid of the Anti-Socialist Law at any 
cost and to do so ignominiously by means of moderation and meek­
ness,  tameness and toadyism' (p. 279). 
Engels countered this by examining the situation in the party and 
in Germany, and stressing that this course of action had no hope of 
succeeding. 'After 3 years of unprecedented persecution...,' he wrote 
to Eduard Bernstein on 30 November 1881, 'our lads have returned, 
not only in all their former strength, but actually stronger than be­
fore' (p. 153). And he amplified: 'the movement... from being restrict­
ed to a few local centres, has only now  come  to be a national movement. 
And that is what frightens the bourgeois most of all' (p. 154). 
Engels had deep faith in the perseverance of the German workers. 
Bismarck's policy, which amounted to war against the workers (a 
state of siege had been declared in a number of  cities,  and the like), he 
noted, only helped the German Social-Democrats' influence to grow. 
'The infamies to which socialist workers everywhere have been sub­
jected,' Engels wrote Sorge on 20 June 1882, 'have everywhere made 
them much more revolutionary than they were even 3 years ago' 
(p. 279). Not submission, as suggested by the right-wing leaders 
(Bios,  Hasenclever, and others), but workers' pressure, Engels held, 
could force the government to repeal the Anti-Socialist Law. 
The clash with the reformist elements in the party and division on 
fundamental and tactical issues were objectively unavoidable, be­
cause the right and left wings of the German Social-Democratic move­
ment reflected the interests of different social groups. In principle, 
Marx and Engels considered à break with the reformists desirable be­
cause, as Engels wrote Bebel on  21 June 1882, the schism would 'serve 
to elucidate the situation and we shall be rid of an element that in no 
way belongs to us' (pp. 281-82). But considering the Anti-Socialist 
Law, Engels advised against needless haste, because in the circum­
stances the workers might think the break would weaken the party 
and augur loss of its gains. Division over controversial issues, he held, 
called for a public discussion, which, however, was practically impos­
sible owing to the Anti-Socialist Law. All the same, Marx and Engels 
promised the party's revolutionary leaders public support if matters 
should come to 'a show-down with these gentry and the party's left 
wing declares itself (p. 282). 
Engels wrote a large number of letters to Bernstein, editor of the So­
zialdemokrat, the party's central organ. He offered advice as to the

Preface XXI 
tactics the paper should follow to suit the conditions ofthat time. En-
gels commended the paper's opposition to the reformist stance of the 
right-wing Social-Democratic deputies in the Reichstag (pp. 173, 
203, 244), and advised its editors to seek workers' support and apply 
for help to correspondents 'from amongst the genuine workers — not 
those who have become "leaders'" (p. 188). This tactic, worked out 
jointly by Marx and Engels (see, e. g., p. 393), proved successful. T am 
delighted,' Engels wrote Bernstein on 22 February 1882, 'that sub­
scriptions should have passed the 4,000 mark and that the paper 
should find regular distribution in Germany, despite the police, etc. 
It is an  incredible  feat for a German paper that is  banned'  (p. 203). 
At a difficult time for the German Social-Democrats, Marx and 
Engels undertook to represent the party in the international workers' 
movement, explaining its political tactics. In their letters to various 
countries, they called on the working class to give its moral and mate­
rial aid to the German Social-Democrats. Marx started collecting 
funds for victims of the Anti-Socialist Law, addressing  himself,  among 
others, to Friedrich Adolph Sorge and journalist John Swinton, who 
was close to the socialists in the United States. 'Even if the monetary 
result were not important,' he wrote Swinton on 4 November 1880, 
'denunciations of Bismarck's new  coup  d'état in public meetings held 
by you, reported in the American press, reproduced on the other side 
of the Atlantic — would sorely hit the Pomeranian  hobereau  [Junker] 
and be welcomed by all the socialists of Europe' (p. 41). 
The letters in this volume show the part Marx and Engels played 
in organising the French Workers' Party. They established contact 
with Jules Guesde and the editors of the Égalité through Paul La-
fargue. This gave them an opportunity to influence the French 
labour movement. A big role here, as we have said, was played by 
Engels' Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. In March 1880, Engels con­
tributed an article, 'The Socialism of Mr Bismarck', to the Egalité. 
It struck out against the Bonapartist social demagogy ofthat time. At 
the request of Benoît Malon, Marx drew up a Workers'  Questionnaire 
(see present edition, Vol. 24). More important still, he participated in 
drawing up the Workers' Party programme, whose theoretical part 
he simply dictated to Guesde in the presence of Engels and Lafargue 
(see pp. 43-44). Later, Engels commented: 'A masterpiece of cogent 
reasoning, calculated to explain things to the masses in a few words;

XXII Preface 
I have seldom seen its like and, even in this concise version, found it 
astonishing' (p. 148). This, indeed, was the programme the Workers' 
Party congress adopted in the autumn of 1880 in Le Havre. Its adop­
tion, Marx pointed out, opened an entirely new stage in the French 
workers' struggle. This was when 'the first real workers' movement' 
began in France, he said (p. 44). 
The theoretical views of the members of the newly formed Work­
ers' Party, however, were still immature. The revolutionary wing 
headed by Guesde and Lafargue (Collectivists) and the reformist fol­
lowers of Malon and Brousse (Possibilists) were entangled in a con­
troversy. It had begun before the congress and was especially heated 
after it. Contrary to any revolutionary transformation of society, the 
Possibilists advanced the idea of the workers' gradually winning 
a majority in the municipalities, thus paving the way for broader 
public services  (services publics)  and the gradual transfer of the means 
of production into the possession of the municipal authorities (muni­
cipal socialism). 
In letters to Bebel and Bernstein, Engels predicted that a conflict with­
in the Workers' Party was objectively unavoidable. 'It would seem,' 
he wrote, 'that any workers' party in a large country can develop on­
ly through internal struggle, as indeed has been generally established 
in the dialectical laws of development.... Such being the case, it 
would be sheer folly to advocate unification. Moral homilies are of no 
avail against teething troubles which, circumstances being what they 
are today, are something that has got to be gone through' (p. 343). 
Marx and Engels sided with the Collectivists, who controlled the 
Egalité (p. 173). In his letters, Engels informed socialists in different 
countries of the reasons for the turmoil within the French Workers' 
Party, and stressed the fundamental nature of the controversy (see 
pp. 196-97, 332-33, 370). The argument concerned diametrically 
opposite attitudes to the party's political programme: whether the 
struggle against the bourgeoisie should be fought as a class struggle 
or whether the class nature of the movement and the revolutionary 
programme should be opportunistically renounced in all cases where 
such renunciation would win it more followers and more votes in elec­
tions.  Engels pointed out that the Possibilists were 'sacrificing the 
proletarian class character of the movement' (p. 350). 
In addition, Marx and Engels also called attention to the Guesd-
ists' theoretical faults and the many tactical mistakes they made in 
the heat of the struggle. To begin with, Guesde and Lafargue negated 

=====第21页=====
Preface XXIII 
reforms in bourgeois society. They denied the need of fighting for 
démocratisation, and of combining struggle for society's social 
reorganisation with struggle for démocratisation. In the absence of 
insight, Engels pointed out, 'party politics cannot be pursued with 
success' (p. 333). Engels therefore faulted Guesde's utterances against 
the Radicals (Clemenceau) (ibid.), who had in the early 1880s 
worked for démocratisation of the French Republic and thereby 
furthered the vital tasks of the working-class movement in the 
country. 
Engels deplored the Guesdists' lack of political skill. He censured 
them for having involved themselves in a polemic on personal 
grounds which only obscured the fight for fundamental aims, and 
also for their contentiousness, quick temper, failure to wait for the 
right time of action, and for phrase-mongering (pp. 181, 154-55 et 
seqq.).  These blunders prevented Marx and Engels from giving their 
full support publicly to the Collectivists. 
All the greater was the importance that Marx and Engels attached 
to correct coverage in the socialist press of Germany of the state of af­
fairs in the French Workers' Party. They called on the French and 
German socialists regularly to exchange their newspapers — Egalité 
and Sozialdemokrat (pp. 360-61). In his many letters to the leaders of 
the German Socialist Workers' Party, Engels never failed to refer to 
the struggle inside the French party. This was doubly necessary, 
because, having failed to grasp its substance, the editors of the Sozial­
demokrat  had initially backed the Possibilists (pp. 386-87). His letters 
to Bernstein, Bebel, and others, showing the social and political 
similarity of possibilism and reformist currents in the workers' and 
socialist movements in other countries, finally prompted the editors of 
the Sozialdemokrat to back the Guesdists. 
Marx and Engels were aware that the two distinct currents could 
no longer coexist within one party, it was time the Guesdists and Pos­
sibilists parted ways (see pp. 343, 350-51). At the St-Étienne congress 
in September 1882 the Possibilists had not only emasculated, but in 
effect totally rejected, the Havre programme by proclaiming local 
party branches fully autonomous as concerned programme issues 
(p. 341 ). That was why neither Engels nor Marx were discouraged by 
the fact that only a minority followed Guesde and Lafargue as a re­
sult of the split. Engels observed: 'The whole of the "workers' party", 
both factions included, constitutes only a small and dwindling por­
tion of the Parisian working-class masses' (p. 333). The party, he said,

XXIV Preface 
was in the first stage of the internal struggle that the socialists in Ger­
many had already passed (p. 351). 
Marx and Engels believed that being champions of revolutionary 
principles, the Guesdists had a far better future than the Possibilists, 
even though the latter were in the majority. 'To be momentarily in 
the minority —  quoad  [as to] organisation — and have the right pro­
gramme,' Engels wrote to Bernstein in November 1882, 'is at least 
better than having no programme and a large, though almost entirely 
nominal and bogus, following' (p. 389). Years later, he was proved 
right. 
The correspondence of Marx and Engels in 1880-83 is evidence of 
their unflagging interest in the British labour movement, which was 
experiencing change, however slow, due to Great Britain's changing 
economic situation. The prolonged depression had shaken the Em­
pire's industrial monopoly. The condition of the working people dete­
riorated. Radical workers' clubs sprang up in London. This was 
a new symptom, Marx wrote to Pyotr Lavrov at the end of January 
1882 (p. 185), and evidence of the appeal socialist ideas had won 
among a section of the working class which began to oppose the Lib­
eral Party, Gladstone's government, and 'official trades-unionism' 
(ibid.). 
The labour movement's vitalisation in the early 1880s also stimulat­
ed interest in scientific socialism among a part of the democratic in­
telligentsia. 'The English,' Marx wrote to Sorge in December 1881, 
'have latterly begun to take rather more notice oîCapitaV (p. 162). He 
had been asked for permission to translate it into English or to trans­
late it himself (ibid.). In letters to his friends, Marx said the first hon­
est reviews had appeared in the British press. He commended young 
English philosopher Belfort Bax's article, 'Karl Marx', in the journal 
Modern Thought of December 1881, and described it as the first Eng­
lish publication 'pervaded by a real enthusiasm for the new ideas 
themselves' and standing up boldly against British philistinism 
(p. 163). 
Engels' letters contain the story of his association with The Labour 
Standard,  a trades union newspaper, in 1881. The attempt at addressing 
trades union members directly, setting forth the basics of the Marxian 
political economy and propagating the ideas of scientific socialism, 
proved unsuccessful. In letters to the Labour Standard editor George

Preface XXV 
Shipton of August 10 and 15, 1881, Engels deplored that the impact his 
articles had made on readers was very weak (pp. 123 and 121). He ex­
plained: 'The British working man just doesn't want to advance; he has 
got to be galvanised by events, the loss of industrial monopoly' (p. 121). 
Despite its various setbacks, Marx and Engels noted, the British 
bourgeoisie was able to offer more favourable conditions to more 
highly qualified workers thanks to Britain's enormous colonial posses­
sions and its supremacy in the world market. They saw this as the rea­
son for the weakness of the British labour and socialist movement, the 
slow spread of socialist ideas in the labour movement, and the pro­
tracted formation of an independent labour party. But Engels' contri­
butions to The Labour Standard had not passed without influence. 
George MacDonald, a British socialist with Marxist leanings, pointed 
out, among others, that it had been Engels' articles in The Labour 
Standard that prompted him to accept scientific socialism (see How I 
Became a Socialist, London, 1896, pp. 61-62). 
Letters showing Marx's and Engels' relationship with Henry 
Mayers Hyndman, a prominent English radical, are of considerable 
interest. Marx tried to explain what factors he thought created possi­
bilities for power to pass peacefully into the hands of the British work­
ing class. In December 1880, he wrote: 'If you say that you do not 
share the views of my party for England I can only reply that that 
party considers an English revolution not  necessary,  but — according 
to historic precedents—possible. If the unavoidable evolution turn in­
to a revolution, it would not only be the fault of the ruling classes, but 
also of the working class. Every pacific concession of the former 
has been wrung from them by "pressure from without'" (p. 49). 
Marx's letter to Hyndman of  2 July 1881 shed light on the reasons 
for their estrangement. Hyndman had put out a pamphlet, England 
for All, as a kind of commentary on the programme of the Democratic 
Federation he had founded the month before, in which he set out the 
content of a number of sections from the first volume of Capital 
without crediting Marx. The latter objected to this publication,  chief­
ly because the Federation's bourgeois democratic goals conflicted 
with the ideas borrowed from  Capital.  The pamphlet would have made 
sense, Marx pointed out, 'for the foundation of a distinct and inde­
pendent Working Class Party' (p. 103). Later, however, even though, 
he was strongly critical of Hyndman (pp. 161-62, 234, 347), Marx 
admitted the objective usefulness of Hyndman's pamphlet because it 
propagated the ideas of Capital (p. 163).

XXVI Preface 
Numerous letters from 1880 to 1883 show Marx's and Engels' 
continual interest in Ireland. At the end of 1880 in a letter to John 
Swinton, Marx stressed the connection between the land questions in 
Ireland and England. Defeat of English landlordism in Ireland, he be­
lieved, would bring about the collapse of the land system in England 
(p. 40). But the Land League's peasant war against English landlord­
ism and Gladstone's rule, and the heightened activity of Irish M.P.s 
under Charles Parnell, led Marx to conclude that Home Rule was the 
only possible solution of the Irish problem. This he wrote to Jenny 
Longuet at the end of April 1881 (see p. 90) and Eduard Bernstein in 
July 1882. 'In the absence of a foreign war or the threat  thereof,' 
he wrote, 'an Irish uprising has not the remotest prospect of success' 
(p. 287), and amplified: 'The only recourse remaining to the Irish is 
the constitutional method of gradual conquest, whereby one position 
is taken after another' (pp. 287-88). 
The letters also show that Marx and Engels followed events in 
North America. Engels noticed 'the colossal speed with which the 
concentration of capitals' was taking place there (p. 251). The two 
friends were aware that the labour movement in the United States 
followed a specific and anything but easy road. Apart from objective 
conditions (free land in the West, and so on), the spread of socialist 
ideas was hindered by strong sectarian tendencies imparted by Ger­
man socialist immigrants, on the one hand, and the dissociation of 
socialist propaganda from the daily struggle of the workers, on the 
other, leaving the stage free for the spread of various radical bour­
geois theories. Highly popular, for example, were the ideas of the rad­
ical economist Henry George. Nationalisation of landed property, 
which he considered the lever of social reconstruction, found a follow­
ing among farmers and those workers who still dreamed of returning 
to the land and were angered by the plunderous ways of real estate 
profiteers, railroad companies, and the like. Marx, however, thought 
the attempt at blaming all social evils on private landownership 
wholly groundless. Contrary to George's theory, cheap land in the 
United States was contributing to the growth of the capitalist system 
at a rate unheard of in Europe. In June 1881, writing of George's 
ideas to Swinton and Sorge, Marx described them as 'merely an 
attempt, tricked out with socialism, to save the capitalist régime and, 
indeed, to  re-establish  it on an even broader basis  than at present' (p. 101).

Preface XXVII 
Marx's and Engels' ties with Russian revolutionaries and public 
leaders continued to expand. Their letters of 1880 to 1883 to Lavrov, 
Vera Zasulich, Danielson, Hartmann, Minna Gorbunova and others, 
reflect their lasting interest in the social-economic and political pro­
cesses underway in Russia and in the life of their Russian acquaint­
ances.  Revolution was in the air in Russia. Marx and Engels held 
that the country stood 'on the threshold of a world historical crisis' 
(p. 18). As before they believed that events in Russia would create 
a revolutionary situation in Europe (see p. 209). And even though 
they were wrong about the time the crisis would break out, Engels 
predicted quite correctly in 1882 that the collapse of the Russian 
Empire would be a long process that would 'go on for years' 
(P. 208). 
Intensive ideological search was under way within the Narodnik 
(Populist) movement, leading to its split and the emergence of two 
groups, Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) and Chorny Peredel (Gen­
eral Redistribution), whose members (Georgi Plekhanov and Vera 
Zasulich) founded the Emancipation of Labour group, the first Rus­
sian Marxist group, in 1883, after Marx's death. The future of the 
peasant commune and its place in the social reorganisation, that is, 
the idea of non-capitalist development in Russia, was the central 
problem that occupied the Russian revolutionary movement at that 
time.  Marx's works, notably Capital, were fairly well known in Rus­
sia (see p. 45), and he was repeatedly asked to give his views on the 
matter (see, e.g., pp. 71-72). 
The volume contains Marx's letter to Vera Zasulich, outlining his 
ideas about the future of the peasant commune in Russia. The anal­
ysis in Capital, he observed, 'does not adduce reasons either for or 
against the viability of the rural commune', and added that it might 
become 'the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia' provided 'the 
deleterious influences which are assailing it from all sides' are elimi­
nated, and it is ensured normal conditions for spontaneous develop­
ment (pp. 71-72). To be sure, the letter did not speak of the long 
reflections that led up to this answer. This we see from the drafts of 
the letter examining the development of the peasant commune after 
the abolition of serfdom in 1861 (see Vol. 24). 
Marx had ties with the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya, 
which he and Engels considered a revolutionary party 'of exceptional 
devotion and vigour' (p. 18). They had always opposed terrorism as 
a means of political struggle, but regarded its terrorist acts in Russia's

XXVIII Preface 
specific conditions of the time as a reaction to governmental terrorism 
and the absence of elementary democratic freedoms for open political 
struggle. 
The volume contains a number of letters concerning the question 
of national independence and the views of Marx and Engels on con­
crete independence struggles of oppressed peoples. Engels pointed out 
in a letter to Kautsky in February 1882 that 'it is historically impossi­
ble for a great people to discuss this or that internal question in any 
way seriously so long as national independence is lacking' (p. 191). 
Marx and Engels considered the work of setting the West Euro­
pean proletariat free a priority, at least for Europe, with everything 
else being subordinate to that aim (see p. 205). They took the example 
of the liberation struggle of the Slav peoples to show that the value of 
any movement of oppressed nations in the historical setting of the 
time depended on whether it clashed with the interests of the working 
class.  They were convinced that only 'the victory of the proletariat 
will liberate them [the oppressed nations] in reality and of necessity' 
(ibid.). 
Until the end of his life, Marx followed developments in India. In 
February 1881, in a letter to Danielson, he observed that serious com­
plications had arisen there for the British government, if not a general 
outbreak, caused by merciless exploitation of the indigenous popula­
tion (see p. 63). It was the duty of the proletariat of Europe, Marx 
and Engels held, to back the liberation struggles of the oppressed 
peoples. Marx commended the meetings organised by the French fol­
lowers of Guesde in defence of the popular movement in Egypt (see 
p. 297). 
At the same time, Marx and Engels warned the European socialists 
against indiscriminate acceptance of national movements and their 
leaders, calling attention to the intrinsic contradictions of social pro­
cesses. 'As I see it,' Engels wrote in reference to the National Party of 
Egypt and its leader Arabi Pasha in August 1882, 'we can perfectly 
well enter the arena on behalf of the oppressed fellaheen without 
sharing their current illusions (for a peasant population has to be 
fleeced for centuries before it learns from experience), and against the 
brutality of the English without, for all that, espousing the cause of 
those who are currently their military opponents' (p. 302). 
Reflecting on the future of the colonies, Engels said he was sure 

=====第27页=====
Preface XXIX 
they would all become independent. But he refused to predict how 
exactly this would occur. As he saw it, revolutions could win in India 
and Algeria and Egypt. That, he added, 'would certainly suit us 
best' (p. 322), meaning the revolutionary proletariat in the advanced 
countries. Engels assumed, however, that the proletarian revolution 
would first occur in Europe, and the colonial countries would 'have 
to be temporarily taken over by the proletariat and guided as rapidly 
as possible towards independence' (ibid.). 
Marx's and Engels' letters to each other in the last few years of 
their joint activity produce an inspiring picture of intellectual colla­
boration and intimacy. Engels, naturally, saw to it that Marx had the 
best doctors and the best health resorts in Europe, and even Algeria. 
'Your altruistic concern for me is unbelievable,' Marx wrote in 
September 1882 (p. 326). But bereavements occurred one after the 
other: Marx's wife died in 1881, and his eldest daughter Jenny in 
January 1883. This was a blow Marx could not survive. He passed 
away on 14 March 1883. 
'Mankind is the poorer for the loss of this intellect—the most im­
portant intellect, indeed, which it could boast today,' wrote Engels 
(p. 462), who was destined to outlive his friend and carry on the cause 
to which they had both devoted their lives.

Dear Liebknecht, 
Your letter arrived slap in the middle of the festive hurly-burly 
which, in view of the multiplication of the Marx family ' and also 
because two of our friends3 from Manchester were staying with us, as­
sumed pretty formidable proportions. In order to forward your letter

Macdonald is the bigger scoundrel of the two 2 but more deeply in­

before mine. As soon as Parliament opens, you can address your let­
ters simply: Alexander Macdonald, House of Commons. 
Since you say you have asked Macdonald for the documents men­

The silver and/or bimetallism 3 affair is the chimera of a few cotton 
speculators in Liverpool. Since it is virtually only silver that circulates 
among the Indian and Chinese traders, and silver has fallen from '/i5.5 
to ' /17.5-1  /is of the value of gold over the past 10 years, this circum­
stance has, of course, further accentuated the crisis in the said article 
brought about by the over-export of cotton goods to the Far East. In

the first place, prices fell as the result of increased supply, and then, 
on top ofthat, these depressed prices represented an even lower gold 
value than hitherto so far as the English exporter was concerned. The 
crafty men of Liverpool, to whom it was quite inconceivable that cot­
ton could ever fall in price as well, now blamed everything on the  dif­
ference in the currency and thought that all would be in order and 
the Indo-Chinese trade would flourish, once it had been decreed here 
that silver should again be '/ 15-5 of the value of gold; i. e. that the Brit­
ish public must put up with silver at 13%-15% above its value so that 
cotton goods exporters might profit by that amount. That's all there 
is to the swindle, and a few more CROTCHET-MONGERS have latched on to 
it. It was never of any significance. Not long ago The Times was phi­
lanthropic enough to opine that gold currency was unsuited to so 
poor a country as Germany and that it would be preferable to revert 
to the more convenient silver currency — in the unspoken hope of 
creating an outlet for the London money market where the latter 
could dispose of its depreciated silver at a price higher than its value. 
Again a pious hope, of course, just like our friend Bismarck's childish 
fancy not long since to go back to bimetallism and reissue the taler as 
good for all payments, although it is worth 15% less than the amount 
it is supposedly good for. However, the German money chaps have 
grown so crafty under friend Bismarck that this no longer proved an 
attraction and the talers that had been issued came hurtling back at 
lightning speed into the Bank and the imperial treasuries. 
I, too, wish you and all the others success in the New Year, as I do 
the Russian  revolution  which will surely get under way in the course of it 
and at once impose a quite different character upon Europe. For this 
too we are largely indebted to our friend Bismarck. With his os­
tentatious trip to Austria and the alliance he concluded there 4  he 
presented the Russian government at precisely the right moment 
(for us!) with the alternative: war or revolution. Quel  génie!"

Many thanks for the banker's letter which I return herewith. But 
I have not the faintest idea what can be meant by 'negotiated à 340 e'. 
I can discover no rational connection whatever between this figure 
and German or Austrian currency. If the man would tell us how 
many marks he thinks he will be able to get for 200 Austrian gulden,

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 7 
IN GENEVA 
London, 1 April 1880 
Dear Old Man, 
This is to notify you that I have taken out a money order for you at 
the post office for four pounds sterling — should amount to 100 frs 
80 cts — and hope it will reach you safely. I trust that your health 
and that of your wife has improved now that the bitter winter is 
happily behind us. Here things are so-so. Mrs Marx is still not quite 
up to the mark and Marx, too, could be better. When winter's over, 
he always has his worst time; his coughing fits prevent him from 
sleeping. 
For the rest, things have reverted to what they were in 1850. The 
Workers' Society has split up into a multitude of parties8— Most 
here,  Rackow there — and it is as much as we can do not to get drawn 
into this maelstrom.1  So many storms in a teacup, which may have an 
altogether salutary effect on some of the participants in that they con­
tribute to their development but, so far as the march of events is con­
cerned, whether 100 German working men here declare themselves for 
this side or for that is pretty immaterial. If they could exert any influ­
ence on the English — but there's no question ofthat. In his thirst for 
action Most cannot keep still but nor, for that matter, can he get any­
thing done; people in Germany just won't see that, because Most has 
been statutorily slung out of the country, the moment of revolution is 
at hand. The  Freiheit  is to become, by hook or by crook, the most rev­
olutionary paper in the world, but this cannot be achieved simply 
by repeating the word 'revolution' in every line. Luckily it matters 
very little what's in the paper and what isn't. The same thing applies 
to the Zurich organ, 11 which advocates revolution one day, only to de­
clare on the next that a violent upheaval is the greatest of misfor­
tunes,  which is afraid on the one hand of being outdone by Most's 
rhetoric and fears on the other that the workers may take its own rheto­
ric to heart. Well, take your pick between the empty rantings of the 
Freiheit and the narrow philistinism of the Sozialdemokrat.

8 5. Engels to Becker. 1 April 1880 
I fear that our friends in Germany are deluding themselves as to 
the kind of organisation that ought to be maintained under present 
circumstances. That elected members of parliament should wish to 
place themselves in the van because there would otherwise be no lead­
ership— to that I have no objection. But they can neither demand 
nor impose the implicit obedience that could be demanded by the 
former party leadership, specifically elected for the purpose. Least of 
all under present circumstances, without a press, without mass meet­
ings.  The more loose-knit the organisation now seems to be, the more 
tightly-knit it is in reality. Instead of this, the old system is to be re­
tained, the party leadership is to have the final say (although there is 
no congress to discipline or, if necessary, dismiss it), and anyone who 
attacks one of  its members is branded a heretic. At the same time, the 
best of them are themselves aware that they have in their midst all 
sorts of incapable and otherwise not very savoury persons, and they 
must be obtuse indeed if they fail to see that it is not they who are in 
control of their organ, but Höchberg, thanks to his money-bags, and 
with him his fellow philistines Schramm and Bernstein. In my view, 
the old party, together with its former organisation, is finished. When, 
as may be expected, the European movement shortly gets going 
again, then it will be joined by the vast mass of the German prole­
tariat, of which the 500,000 men of 1878 9 will form the trained and 
educated nucleus, and then, too, the old 'rigorous organisation' de­
riving from the Lassallean tradition will become a brake which, 
though it might hold back a waggon, no one could hope to apply to 
an avalanche. 
At the same time, these men are doing a number of things which 
may wholly disrupt the party. First, the party is to go on maintaining 
its former agitators and editors by saddling itself with a mass of pa­
pers which contain nothing more than may be found in any middle-
class local rag. And the workers are supposed to tag along with that 
indefinitely! Secondly, their bearing in the Reichstag and in the Sax­
on Diet is for the most part so meek as to discredit both them and the 
party in the eyes of the whole world; they make 'positive' suggestions 
to the existing government as to how it might do better in minor 
questions of detail, etc. And the workers, who have been declared 
outside the law and delivered up, bound hand and foot, to the tender 
mercies of the police, are expected to regard this as adequate repre­
sentation! Thirdly, there is their tolerance of the philistine petty bour-
geoiserie of the  Sozialdemokrat.  In every  letter we are told that we must

on no account believe any reports of splits or differences of opinion 
within the party, but everyone who comes here from Germany assures 
us that our people are completely bewildered by this conduct on the part 
of their leaders and that they by no means agree with it. Nor could it 
be otherwise, given the character of our workers which has so splen­
didly stood the test. It is a peculiarity of the German movement that 
all the mistakes committed by the leadership are invariably put right 
by the masses, and no doubt such will again be the case this time. ' ° 
Well, keep your pecker up and drop us a line occasionally. Bork-
heim is still in pretty well the same helpless condition as before.3

Mr H. Meyer, 
Your favour of 25 March ' ' did not come into my hands until late

I could not accept your invitation. 
In view of the rifts and differences of opinion that have recently oc­
curred among German Social-Democrats here and elsewhere, I am 
unable for the time being to declare myself in favour either of one 
party or of the other, especially as I cannot but reprobate, not only 
the policy of the Zurich  Sozialdemokrat,  but also and no less that of the 
London Freiheit*

[...]a so as to make the whole thing impossible without actually 
prohibiting it. 
Mr Hasselmann will soon become harmless if you people bring to 
light  really  compromising facts about him and take the wind out of his 
sails in the Reichstag, i. e. proceed in a frankly revolutionary way, 
which can be done by using quite temperate language, as you your­
self did in exemplary fashion in your speech on the persecutions. 13 If, 
however, a person is constantly afraid of being thought by the philis-
tine,  as often happens, to be a bit more extreme than he really is, and 
if in fact the enclosed cutting from the  Kölnische  Leitung is correct in re­
porting that the Social-Democrats have brought a motion intended 
to restore the guild privilege of trading in home-made goods, then 
the Hasselmanns and Mosts will have an easy task. 
None of this, however, is really of much consequence. What is now 
keeping the party alive is unobtrusive, spontaneous activity on the 
part of individuals; like its organisation, it is kept going by their irre­
pressible journeyings. In Germany we have fortunately reached the 
stage when every action of our adversaries is advantageous to us; 
when all historical forces are playing into our hands, when nothing,

absolutely nothing, can happen without our deriving advantage from 
it. For that reason we can quietly allow our adversaries to work for us. 
Bismarck is working for us like a real Trojan. He has now won Ham­
burg for us 14 and will shortly also make us a present, first of Altona, 
and then of Bremen. The National Liberals '5 are working for us, 
even though all they do is submit to kicks and vote taxes. The Catho­
lics are working for us, even though they voted first against, and then 
for, the Anti-Socialist Law, '6 in return for which they, too, have sim­
ply been delivered by Bismarck over to the tender mercies of the gov­
ernment, i. e. also placed outside the law. Anything we can do is 
a mere drop in the ocean compared with what events are doing for us 
at this moment. Bismarck's feverish activity, which is throwing every­
thing into disorder and putting everything out of joint without achiev­
ing anything of a remotely positive nature; which is stretching the 
philistine's tax-paying potential to the utmost limit, and this for noth­
ing and worse than nothing; which wants one thing one day and the 
opposite the next and is forcibly driving into the arms of the revolu­
tion the philistine who would so gladly grovel at his feet — this is our 
strongest ally, and I'm delighted at your being able to confirm from 
actual observation that there has in fact been a shift to the left, as 
was inevitable in the circumstances. 
In France, too, things are progressing well. Our communist view­
point is breaking new ground everywhere and the best of those advo­
cating it are all of them former anarchists who have come over to us 
without our raising a finger/ Unanimity has thus been established 
among European socialists; any who are still shilly-shallying aren't 
worth mentioning now that the last remaining sect, the anarchists, 
has melted away. There, too, we find increasingly a general shift to 
the left among the bourgeois and peasants, as you have already re­
marked; but there's one snag here: this shift to the left is primarily 
tending towards a war of  retribution  and that must be avoided. 
The victory of the Liberals here has at least  one good aspect in that 
it puts a spoke in the wheel of Bismarck's foreign policy.17 Since he 
might just as well dismiss the Russian war from his mind now, he will, 
as usual, doubtless sell his ally — Austria — to the first comer. After 
all, the bitter experiences of 1864-66 have already shown the Aus-
trians that Bismarck seeks allies only to betray them '8 — but they're 
too stupid and will again fall into the trap. 
a Engels probably means, above all, Paul Brousse and Benoît Malon.

In Russia, too, everything is proceeding splendidly, despite judicial 
murder, banishments and an appearance of calm. You can't banish 
sheer lack of money. Not one banker will make a loan without a guar­
antee from the Imperial Assembly. Hence the present desperate 
recourse to an internal loan. On paper it will be a success, in reality 
a total failure. And then they will have to convene some assembly or 
other if only to obtain cash — always supposing something else 
doesn't happen in the meantime.

My dear Lafargue, 
What are we to do about the introduction Malon has submitted? 20 
Grateful as I am for his good intentions, what is needed here are facts, 
and where would he get them from? The history of German socialism 
from 1843 to 1863 is not yet in print, and Malon's German friends in 
Zurich know hardly anything about that period, which preceded their 
entry into political life. So it is natural enough that Malon's introduc­
tion should omit the most important facts while going into details 
which can hardly interest the French reader and should, besides, be 
riddled with mistakes of a fairly serious kind. To mention only one — 
Lassalle was never editor of the Neue  Rheinische  Leitung. He never so 
much as contributed to it, if one excepts a feuilleton in a single is­
sue—  a feuilleton which was, moreover, completely rewritten by the 
editorial  staff.  At that time Lassalle was almost wholly taken up with 
the adulteries and divorce proceedings of Countess Hatzfeldt and her

London, 27 June 1880

Dear Sir, 
At the urgent insistence of my doctor I must refrain from work of 
any kind for some time to come; [indeed] a I should already have left 
London on a recuperative trip to the seaside or mountains had I not 
been prevented from doing so by the very serious illness of my wife. 
Letters sent to the above address, however, will always find me, as 
they will be forwarded. 
But my present state of health apart, I could not have complied 
with your request,25 if only because I don't know enough Dutch to 
be able to judge whether this or that expression is appropriate. 
Nevertheless, to go by the essays of yours I have read in the Jahr­
buch der Sozialwissenschaft (Volume I, Second Half), 26 I have not the 
slightest doubt that you are the right man to provide the Dutch with 
a résumé of Capital—I would also mention en passant that 
Mr Schramm (C. A. S., p. 81) b misconstrues  my theory  of value.  From a 
note in Capital to the effect that A. Smith and Ricardo are mistaken 
in lumping together value and price of production 2 7 (let alone market 
prices, therefore) — he could already have gathered that the connec­
tion between 'value' and 'price of production', hence also between 
'value' and the market prices that oscillate about the 'price of pro­
duction', has no place whatever in the theory of value as such, still 
less can it be anticipated by cliché-ridden, scholastic generalisations. 
Under present circumstances the 2nd part of Capital26 cannot 
appear in Germany, which I am quite glad of inasmuch as certain 
economic phenomena are, at this precise moment, entering upon 
a new phase of development and hence call for fresh appraisal. 
With kindest regards, 
Yours sincerely,

ENGELS TO MINNA GORBUNOVA 
IN BIARRITZ 
London, 22 July 1880 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Madam, 
After a number of vagaries, your letter from Biarritz  2 9 has safely 
reached me here, where I have been living for the past 10 years, and 
I hasten to let you have such information as it is within my power to 
give. 
I have talked over the matter with my friend Marx, and we both 
take the view that no better sources on the English industrial school 
system are to be had over here than the official reportsa you already 
possess. The content of other non-official literature on the subject 
amounts to little more than window-dressing, where it is not expressly 
designed to provide an advertisement for some humbug or other. 
I shall have a look round and see if I can find anything that might 
interest you among the reports of the SCHOOL  BOARDS  and the Educa­
tion Department in recent years, and shall send you further details if 
you would be so kind as to let me know to what address I should 
write or send packages, either within the next fortnight or so, or else 
in the autumn (since I shall be away from London for some time30). 
The industrial education of young people is in an even worse state 
here than in most countries on the Continent and what is being done, 
is done mostly for appearances' sake. You will have seen from the ac­
tual reports that the 'INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS' are by no means on a par 
with continental industrial schools, but are a kind of penal institute 
where neglected children are committed for a given number of years 
by order of court. 
On the other hand, the efforts made in America might perhaps be 
of greater interest to you. The United States has sent a wealth of ma­
terial connected with this to the Paris Exhibition,31 material which 
must be lodged in the big library in the rue Richelieu 32 and of which 
" Reports of  the Commissioners  Appointed  to Inquire into the State of Popular  Education  in Eng­
land and Reports of  Reformatory  and Industrial School.

you will find details in the catalogue of the exhibition at the said 
library. 
I am further endeavouring to find out for you the address of a 
Mr Da Costaa in Paris; his sonb played a part in the Commune in 
1871,  and the father is himself employed in education, is passionately 
interested in his profession and would be more than willing to be of 
assistance to you. 
Again, the schools for the further education of adult working men 
over here are not as a rule up to very much. Where anything worth 
while is done, it is usually thanks to special circumstances and individ­
ual personalities, i. e. local and temporary. In all such matters, the 
only element that systematically recurs here is humbug. The best of 
establishments relapse after a short while into a stultifying routine 
and the avowed purpose increasingly becomes a pretext for the em­
ployees to earn their keep as comfortably as possible. So much is this 
the rule that even establishments for the education of the children of 
the middle classes — bourgeoisie — form no exception. Indeed I have 
latterly come across a number of notable instances of this very kind. 
I am sorry that at this stage I should not myself be able to place 
any fresh material at your disposal; for a number of years it has unfor­
tunately been impossible for me to follow the course of public educa­
tion in any detail. Otherwise I should have been only too delighted to 
be able to offer you more. Everything that furthers public education 
and hence the movement, however indirectly, in a country such as 
Russia, which stands on the threshold of a world historical crisis, 
and has produced a dynamic party of exceptional devotion and 
vigour—everything of this nature commands our most ardent sym­
pathy. 
I am, Madam, 
Yours truly,

Dear Madam, 
In all haste — for several days my house has been full of friends, 
come on a visit from the provinces — herewith the address: 
M. Da Costa, 40 rue Gay-Lussac, Paris. Since I have only seen the 
old gentleman once and very briefly, he will certainly not remember 
me. But all you need say by way of introduction is that Marx ob­
tained the address expressly for you through his son-in-law Longuet 
— who is a friend of young Da Costa's. a

ENGELS TO MINNA GORBUNOVA 34 
IN PARIS 
London, 5 August 1880 
122a Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Madam, 
Further to my brief note sent to Biarritz,b all I can tell you is that 
I don't in fact know of any documents or reports I could recommend 
to you other than those first enumerated by yourself in your previous 
esteemed letter.35 However, after the school holidays, when the vari­
ous people I'm acquainted with return, I shall make further inquiries, 
and if I find anything new, shall send it to you in Moscow 36 or report 
to you further. In order that such correspondence should appear per­
fectly innocuous, I shall write in English and sign myself E. Burns. 
When communicating with me from there, you could address your 
letters: Miss E. Burns, 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W., London. An 
inner envelope is unnecessary; she is my niece. 
I was most interested to hear about your activities in Moscow and 
about the prospect of your setting up an industrial school with the 
help of the president of the 3CMCTBOC37; we, too, have the statistical 
reports of all the Russian 3eMCTBa over here, as in general quite excel-
a 112 in the manuscript. -b See previous letter. -c Zemstvo

lent material on economic conditions in Russia, but unfortunately 
I cannot look it out at this moment as it is at Marx's house and he and 
all his family are away at the seaside.38 However it wouldn't be much 
help to me in answering your inquiry,3Q  since this calls for a knowl­
edge of the relevant branches of the cottage industry, its operation, 
products and competitiveness, and that can only be acquired on the 
spot. All in all it seems to me that most, at any rate, of the branches of 
industry you mentioned would probably be capable of competing 
with large-scale industry for some time yet. Industrial revolutions 
such as these progress extremely slowly; even the handloom has not 
yet been entirely superseded in some branches in Germany, whereas 
in England those same branches did away with it 20 or 30 years ago. 
In Russia that process might well be even slower. After all, the long 
winter provides the peasant with a great deal of spare time, and even 
if he only earns something during the day, that is still so much gain. 
Admittedly these primitive forms of production cannot escape their 
ultimate demise, and in a highly developed industrial country, as 
here,  for example, one might claim that it would be more humane to 
accelerate this process of dissolution rather than prolong it. In Russia 
the situation may well be different, especially as there is some pros­
pect there of violent changes in the political situation as a whole. The 
minor palliatives which have proved virtually useless in Germany, as 
you yourself have of course discovered, and also elsewhere, might in 
Russia help the people on occasion to surmount the political crisis 
and keep their industry going until such time as they also have a say. 
The schools, however, might perhaps enable them to get at least some 
idea of what they ought to say. And all genuine educative elements 
that are dispersed among the people will, to a greater or lesser extent, 
contribute to that end. Technical instruction might perhaps best 
achieve its aim if it sought, on the one hand, to organise the operations at 
any rate of the more viable branches of traditional industry in a more 
rational way and, on the other, to provide the children with sufficient 
training in general technology to facilitate their transition to other 
industries. Aside from such generalisations there is, at this distance, 
little to be said. Except that this much seems pretty clear to me: The 
Moscow  gouvernement  is unlikely to become a seat of large-scale indus­
try in the near future, since it is remote from the coal-mining areas, 
and wood fuel is already in short supply. Cottage industry in some, if 
not always the same, form might persist there for a bit longer even if 
protective tariffs were to make feasible the introduction of this or that

large enterprise, such as the cotton industry of Shuya and Ivanovo in 
the Vladimir  gouvernement.  And, after all, the only way one can really 
help the peasants is to see that they get more land and cultivate it in 
associations. 
Your report about the incipient decay of the oöuniHa 340 and the 
artel 4 ' confirms news that has also come to us from another quarter. 
Nevertheless this process of disintegration may go on for a very long 
time.  And since the general current in Western Europe is flowing in 
precisely the opposite direction and, with the next convulsion, must 
acquire a strength of a quite different order, it may be expected that 
in Russia, too, which has certainly produced a great many critical 
minds over the past 30 years, this current will still be strong enough 
to make a timely appeal to the people's innate, millennial urge to as­
sociate before that urge is completely extinguished. For this reason, 
productive associations and other means of promoting the associate 
system among the people in Russia should also be looked at from an 
aspect other than the Western one. Admittedly they still remain no 
more than minor palliatives. I remain, 
Yours most respectfully,

Dear Old Man, 
Your postcard was not forwarded to me here3  ° until today and 
I immediately took out a money order for you for two pounds ster­
ling, i. e. 50 frs and a few centimes (on which I wrote my London 
address). It goes without saying, of  course,  that we wouldn't let you be 
thrown out of your house while we were restoring our health at the 
seaside here. There's no need for you to make such a to-do about 
a few pence; that sort of thing is a matter of course between old com­
rades-in-arms who have been fighting under the same flag for forty 
years and who hearken to the same trumpet-calls. 
We are all here — Marx, his wife and his daughters, together with 
husbands and children,3 and the visit is proving especially beneficial 
to Marx, who, I hope, will be completely refreshed. His wife has unfor­
tunately been ailing for some time, but is as cheerful as could be ex­
pected. I shall be returning to London next week but Marx ought to 
stay here as long as he possibly can.

Apropos, I should perhaps add that there's been a great muddle 
over the letters. Marx has never had letters of yours for safe-keeping, 
whereas Borkheim was supposed to have had some of yours and, 
when Mrs Marx was still in Geneva with you, you got her to ask 
Marx to get Borkheim to give them to him. a But now Borkheim de­
nies ever having got any from you; so what the actual facts of the case 
are, we over here are unable to fathom. 
Well, I hope that, for the time being at least, you have extricated 
yourself from the worst of your predicament and will get a bit of 
peace. Kindest regards from us all, and in particular from,

money — i.e.  S 200 — in YANKEELAND, the matter will have to be

My dear Laura, 
I have only a few minutes to reply to your amiable letter—we have 
been inspecting a geological amateur's collection this evening and to­
morrow we are off to an excursion to Flamboro' Head. The weather 
here continues grand: regular Rhenish October weather, that is the 
acme of fine weather as far as I know, not a cloud on the sky, hot sun, 
cool bracing air at the same time. Why cannot you and Lafargue 
come for a week, the place is getting empty, plenty of apartments and 
accommodation of every sort. 
I have not heard from Pumps since the letter I had at Ramsgate 
dated, I believe, 15th August. I wrote her at once, and since then, on 
arrival in London, last Friday b this day week, a postcard, but no re­
ply. Now I am almost certain that she has written to Sarah or her 
mother Mrs Nicholls who stays in our house during my absence.

Would it be too much trouble for you to call there and inform me of 
the result of your inquiries as I am getting rather anxious and as I am 
sure there is some misunderstanding abroad by which I am kept 
without news? 
It is now half past nine at night, all windows wide open and yet the 
fine cool air outside will not come in rapidly enough to enable me to 
keep my coat on. The beer — oh the beer, it would be worth your 
while to come here only in order to drink one glass of beer at the Pier 
refreshment rooms, a nice little café — such splendid beer! 
Moore and Beust are off to the 'Parade' (such a thing you know is 
de rigueur*  at every seaside place) to hear the music and hunt backfishes, 
of which there are excellent specimens here; you know the backfish h

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE' 9 
IN LONDON 
Bridlington Quay, 9 September 1880 
My dear Lafargue, 
I had to write to you in haste the day before yesterday  5 2 because 
we were due to leave at 9.30 for an excursion to Flamboro' Head 
where our two naturalists3 botanised in the sea. In case I didn't 
express myself clearly enough, let me summarise. 
The more serious aspect of Grant's scheme is that he alone has the 
right to raise or lower the value of your shares, if not make them vir­
tually worthless. To begin with, he is deducting 12% per annum for 
the first 4 guides. If the gross profit amounts to 15%, that leaves a net 
profit, the shareholders' dividend, of only 3%; if 20% it leaves 8%, 
etc. But with the generous salaries Grant proposes to pay the local di­
rectors, can one count on such profits? That seems to me exceedingly 
doubtful. 
Let us suppose, however, that the gross profit amounts to 20% or 
even 25%. What will Grant do then? He will propose to borrow yet 
a Samuel Moore and Adolph Beust 

=====第56页=====
28 20. Engels to Paul Lafargue. 9 September 1880 
more money so as to launch the remainder of the guides. And he will 
claim that he can only obtain that money at 15% or 20%. Since he 
will have a ready-made majority, the vote will go his way. And since 
you and Jervis won't be able to obtain the money at a cheaper rate, 
you will get nowhere at all by opposing him. Well then, £3,000 at 
12%,  £3,000 at 20%, gives an average of 16%—just imagine how 
a business can function if it is saddled with interest at that rate before 
so much as a thought can be paid to dividends. 
There is nothing to prevent Grant providing you with funds, as 
soon as there is a further need of them, at still higher interest, the rate 
of which will depend upon him alone. Since it is he who pockets the 
interest, at least the greater part  thereof,  it is in his interest to ap­
proach as closely as possible the rate of gross profit generated by the 
firm. He shares the interest only with the man who advances this 
money — the net profit he shares with all the other shareholders. 
So in fact the value of your PAID  UP shares goes down and down and 
Grant alone has the right to reduce it to nothing. In other words he 
pays the two of you for your literary property 1. £400; 2. £300 each 
the moment it suits him to get rid of you; 3. in virtually worthless 
shares carrying no dividend; total £ 500 each, always provided Grant 
does not find a way of avoiding payment of the £300 — which 
wouldn't be too difficult — by accusing you of breach of contract, in 
which case there would be a fine old lawsuit costing you much more 
than £ 300, even if you won. 
Grant cannot invoke your letter. Even if it contains what he 
alleges, that letter ceases to be valid after the month during which 
you were bound by it. 
Jervis'  interest is not identical with yours. If he has neglected his af­
fairs and is prepared to sacrifice the lot of them for £ 300 a year, that 
goes to show that they weren't worth the trouble of discussing. Jervis 
is staying in London. Once launched by Grant on this enterprise, it is 
in his interest to be launched by him on other enterprises, to act as his 
UNDERSTRAPPER  until such time as he has enough money and enough fi­
nancial contacts to do without him. You have an entirely different 
interest. You are going to Paris, you hope to find an assured existence 
in this enterprise. Ask yourself if such is to be found under the terms 
proposed by Grant. 
It is likewise in the interests of your SOLICITOR, evidently another 
underling, to pay court to Grant. And this applies to everyone save 
yourself.  All the more reason not to conclude anything in haste. 

=====第57页=====
20. Engels to Paul Lafargue. 9 September 1880 29 
Jervis has undertaken to find the necessary capital; well and good, 
but this must obviously be on terms acceptable to you, and not on 
such as would deliver you over bound hand and foot to a money­
lender of the first water. 
You would do well to sound Bradshaw. The latter has a twofold 
interest in coming to an arrangement with you in respect both of this 
country and of the Continent. If only as a means of putting pressure 
on Grant. It would be better still to have a choice between the two. 
And Bradshaw cannot allow himself to go in for the sharp practices 
that are the other man's stock-in-trade. Unfortunately you can no 
longer have full confidence in Jervis, once he claims to have tired of 
the matter and advises you to accept forthwith. 
That is, of course, the gloomier aspect of the affair. Grant may 
possibly have more generous intentions, but once the contract has 
been signed you will be at his mercy, of that you may be certain. 
With a man like Grant I see no means of safeguarding  oneself.  You 
could insert a condition that all net profits must be used to pay off the 
£ 3,000 and that no dividends are distributed so long as the company 
is paying interest of more than 6% — they would either not accept it 
or find a way of deleting if at the first shareholders' meeting. And that 
would merely safeguard the first £ 3,000; as regards subsequent bor­
rowings it would do nothing of the kind; it would be nonsensical to re­
pay with one hand and borrow with the other. 
My advice is try to  manage  without Grant and, if you can't, at least try 
to make him fear that you can do without him, so that he robs you 
a little less UNMERCIFULLY than he intended. He will rob you anyhow. 
The weather here continues magnificent, sunshine all the time, 
bracing air, north-east breeze, sea-bathing already somewhat brac­
ing, but this evening I fear I shall have to wear an overcoat as at 
Ramsgate. The visitors are quite different from those at Ramsgate. 
Here we have the SHOPKEEPER, the small manufacturer, the TRADESMAN 
from Leeds, Sheffield, Hull, etc., an atmosphere decidedly more pro­
vincial yet at the same time more solid than at Ramsgate; no 'ARRYS. 
What strikes you most is the fact that all the young girls are backfish a 
between 14 and 17 years — what you call the ugly age, although there 
are some very pretty ones here. Of young girls fashioned to per­
fection there are none or virtually none. No sooner have they ceased 
to be backfish than they're put into long skirts and, so it would seem,

My dear Sir, 
I need not tell you that I should feel only too happy to do anything 
you consider useful,55 but a short statement of the circumstances in 
which I find myself at this moment will convince you that I am at pre­
sent unfit for theoretical labour. Having been sent here by the medi­

time since, has suddenly been aggravated to a degree which menaces 
to tend to a. fatal termination. Whatever little time I may snatch for 
work, is necessarily limited to things which I must get rid of. 
However, the most important part for the public in general is that 
a Moore and Beust -b  Friedrich Beust - c Abbreviated from  dolce  far niente (sweet 
doing nothing), which originates from a similar Latin expression used by Pliny the

which you have already performed — the drawing up of the statistical 
tables and the interpretation of the facts which they imply. It would 
be a pity if you delayed the publication which I expect myself with 
the greatest impatience.56 
Whatever you may have found useful in my letters for that pur­
pose,  you may freely dispose of. Only I fear it is not much, since I sent 
you only a few fragmentary scraps. 
The present crisis was the greatest England has passed through 
with regard to duration, extent and intensiveness,57  but despite the 
failures of some Scotch and English provincial banks — the crowning 
of the past English great periodical crises, I mean the financial crash 
in London, shone by its absence. This most extraordinary incident — 
the absence of the  monetary panic  properly so called, was due to a con­
catenation of circumstances the analysis of which would lead me too 
far at present. One of the most decisive circumstances was, however, 
this: The heavy bullion drain of 1879 was to a great extent met by the 
cooperation of the Banque de France and the Imperial Bank of 
Germany. On the other hand, the sudden revival in the United 
States — since the spring of 1879 — reacted on England like a deus 
ex machina.* 
As to the agricultural crisis, it will gather strength, develop  itself, 
and, by the bye, come to a head, carrying with it quite a revolution in 
the relations of landed property,— quite independent of the cycles of 
the commercial-industrial crises. Even such optimists as Mr Caird 
have commenced 'to smell a rat'. Most characteristic of English 
blockheadedness is this: since two years there have been published 
letters of farmers — in The Times as well as in agricultural papers — 
giving the items of their expenses in cultivating their farms, compar­
ing them with their returns at present prices, and winding up with a 
positive deficit. Would you believe that not one of the specialists — 
expatiating upon these accounts — has thought of considering how 
these accounts  would stand if  the item of  rent was struck out in many cases 
or reduced 'most feelingly' in many other cases? But this is a delicate 
point which must not be touched. The farmers themselves, though 
become unbelievers in the nostrums proposed by their landlords or 
the 'plumitifs' b of the latter, dare not yet assume attitudes of bold vi-
a deus ex machina  — a god from the machine (by which in ancient theatre gods were 
shown in the air); a power or an event that comes in the nick of time to solve a difficulty -

rility, considering that they, on their part, are denounced by the rus­
tic 'labouring class'. A nice pickle it is altogether. 
I hope there will be no general war in Europe. Though, ultimately, 
it could not check, but would rather intensify, the social, I mean 
thereby the economical, development, it would certainly produce 
a useless exhaustion of forces for some longer or shorter interval.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 58 
IN LONDON 
Bridlington Quay, 12th September 1880 
My dear Lafargue, 
How can I advise you on business if you give me all the informa­
tion afterwards? If you had sent me the draft articles5  9 before, 
I should have known better what to say. Do not say that you had not 
got it; it was your business to have had it as soon as printed. Mais on 
dirait que vous brûlez de  vous  faire voler} 
You say the articles forbid to borrow at more than 10%. Whoever 
told you that, reckoned upon your credulity. Article 74 says distinctly 
that the directors can raise money  upon  such terms and  conditions  in all 
respects  as they  think fit. Now I do not know and cannot be expected to 
know whether the acts of parliament forbid limited companies to 
raise money at more than 10%. I doubt it. But if it be the fact, you 
have before your eyes the proof that that is no use whatever. Have 
a Marx's pseudonym-b But anyone would think you were begging to be robbed.

22. Engels to Paul Lafargue. 12 September 1880 33 
you not written to me that Grant wanted to raise £3,000 — at 10% 
and a bonus of 20% at the end of five years? 20% divided by 5 is 4, 
and 10 + 4 are 14; thus, you pay really 14% for your money. Why do 
you not speak of that when people want to make you believe that 
Grant cannot get more than 10% out of your company in interest? 
Then you say, Jervis and Mason had pris des garanties contre 
Grant, en ce que rien de nouveau pouvait être décidé sans qu'on ait 
au moins le vote des 4/s des actionnaires, et que Grant n'avait que 
55%  et que par conséquent il ne pouvait rien faire sans votre consen­
tement. 
Décidément on se moque de vous." In the whole agreement not 
a word about 4/ 5 of the shareholders. All resolutions by simple majori­
ties. It may be in the acts of parliament that 4/5 are required to alter 
the original deed  of association.  But that is not the question. I have shown 
you the way how Grant by his system of loans at 10% and any bonus 
he likes, can suck all the profits out of the company. And Article 74 
gives him the right to do so, without even consulting anybody but his 
directors who, whatever they may be, are sure to be his puppets. 
Secondly. All the capital being subscribed you have 
1) 5,000  votes for original capital—£5,000.-
2) 3,000 votes for preference shares 3,000 at £5 each (Art. 49). 
8,000  votes in all. Out of these you, Jervis and Mason have together 
2,250 votes, that is to say not 45% against 55%, but 28% against 
72%.  Still more than '/s, but not very far off. Let a few shares be sold 
by one of you, and the power to stop even alterations of deed of asso­
ciation is lost by you. You will be told that it is not intended to issue 
all the preference shares. But how long that remains so, will depend 
upon Grant. 
There is another article which may affect you and alter the case. 
Art. 21 says that for calls not yet made, but paid up by the share­
holder voluntarily, interest up to 10% shall be paid. I should pre­
sume that this applies to your paid up shares, only, if it was so, 
Jervis and Mason would have pointed it out to you; at least I should 
think so. If that be the case and you can secure 10% on the greater 
part of your shares that would be so much in your favour. See 
whether it is so or not. 
* safeguarded themselves against Grant in that no new decision could be taken with­
out the consent of at least 4/5 of the shareholders and that Grant had only 55% and 
hence could do nothing without your consent.— They're having you on, no doubt 
about that.

Upon the whole I think, after your last letter, a little more favour­
ably of the business. If the money raised at such ruinous interest can 
be limited to the first £ 3,000.- and these repaid after the 5 years or 
before, the thing may work well. But it strikes me that it will require 
very large profits indeed to pay all these lavish expenses. £50.- to 
each director, £ 100.- to the Chairman, £? to the Manager, £300.- to 
the directors in London and Paris and so forth. All that with a work­
ing capital of £ 3,000.-, less than three times the salaries named 
above! And 14% interest besides. 
I cannot write to you about Jervis as you say you read my letters to 
him and Mason. Else I should have something to say to that. Any­
how, the honesty of a financier is different from that of some people, 
be it ever so honest in its own way. 
I must conclude; dinner is going to be laid. Si vous ne voyez pas

qués ci-dessus.

Have received the enclosed from Liebknecht. I am writing to tell 
him that, provided he hears nothing to the contrary within the next 
few days, we shall be back in London again from next Sunday, 
19 September, 30 and shall be expecting them (him and Bebel).60 So 
if you should be prevented in any way, kindly let me know. 
I haven't had an answer to a postcard sent from here to your ad­

day I heard from Lafargue, who said you would be returning to Lon­

We shall be returning at the end of this week; wet weather since the 
day before yesterday, before which the weather was splendid. 
I hope your wife is better.

Sir, 
Mr Kaulitz was introduced to me on his arrival in England last 
spring, by a letter from an old friend in Germany. The letter stated 
that Mr Kaulitz was of a very good family, his father being one of the 
first notaries in Brunswick (a position of much importance and great 
trust in Germany), and recommended him warmly to me. From what 
I have seen of him since, he appears to be a man of very great business 
abilities and to have succeeded very well, so far, in the scholastic line; 
but on this point no doubt the professional gentleman to whom Mr K. 
may have referred you, will be able to give you more satisfactory 
information.

Dear Old Man, 
I've heard from Liebknecht that you're still short of cash but that 
they can't help you just now. By a lucky chance I was on the point of 
putting a five pound note on one side for you and have lost no time in 
changing it into a money order for 126 frs. I trust it reaches you 
safely and soon and will tide you over your initial difficulties until such 
time as the Leipzigers can do something for you. And so they damned 
well ought. You're certainly as much a victim of the Exceptional 
Law ' 6 as the agitators in Germany who have been deprived of their 
livelihood. 
Liebknecht was here 60 and promised that the Zurich papera would 
adopt a different attitude in keeping with the party's former attitude. 
If that is done, it's all we ask. 
Adieu and keep your pecker up. 
Your old friend

27. Engels to Kaulitz. 28 October 1880 39 
namely that you have given his name as a reference without his permis­
sion. The rest is beside the point. 
With regard to Beust,a I do not propose to go into the question of 
when you offered to give the said lessons elsewhere. This much is cer­
tain: that after our return from Bridlington Quay 30 you again offered 
to give lessons to Beust, that you promised, in the presence of myself 
and Schorlemmer, to set about the thing in the manner stipulated, 
that you did the opposite of what you had promised, and that Beust, 
far from attacking his 'very dear friend Kaulitz' behind his back, told 
him in Trafalgar Square exactly what he thought of him, adding 
quite rightly that all three of us had been convinced from the outset 
that you wouldn't do a single thing you had promised. I should have 
written you off there and then had it not been for the fact that I avoid 
making private matters a cause for breaking with people with whom 
I have been in any way connected politically. 
Concerning the tittle-tattle in the Central News, I will not labour 
the point as to whether it was you or Most who disseminated it, since 
I am not permitted to divulge my sources, and since, on the other 
hand, I lay no store at all by the agent's letter. 
If one is compelled to make a decision such as mine in regard to 
yourself,  one bases it not on this or that particular indiscretion, but 
rather on the other's whole mode of behaviour, observed over a con­
siderable period. And in any case your almost daily intercourse with 
Most and Co., which you freely admit, is quite enough to supply, in 
place of the fact you contest, another that is no less convincing. 
Yours very truly

MARX TO JOHN SWINTON 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 4 November 1880 
41 Maitland Park Road, N.W. 
My dear Sir, 
I have sent you today a copy of the French edition of the Capi­
tal.  6 3 I have at the same time to thank you for your friendly article in 
The Sun. 4  3 
Apart Mr Gladstone's 'sensational' failures abroad64 — political 
interest centres here at present on the Irish 'Land Question'. And 
why? Mainly because it is the harbinger of the English 'Land Ques­
tion1. 
Not only that the great landlords of England are also the largest 
landholders of Ireland, but having once broken down in what is iro­
nically called the 'Sister'-island, the English landed system will no 
longer be tenable at home. There are arrayed against it the British 
farmers, wincing under high rents, and — thanks to the American 
competition — low prices; the British agricultural labourers, at last 
impatient of their traditional position of ill-used beasts of burden, 
and — that British party which styles itself 'Radical'. The latter con­
sists of two sets of men; first the  ideologues  of the party, eager to over­
throw the political power of the aristocracy by mining its material 
basis,  the semi-feudal landed property. But behind these principle-
spouters, and hunting them on, lurks another set of men — sharp, 
close-fisted, calculating capitalists, fully aware that the abolition of 
the old land laws, in the way proposed by the ideologues, cannot but 
convert land into a commercial article that must ultimately concen­
trate in the hands of capital. 
On the other side, considered as a national entity, John Bull has ugly 
misgivings lest the aristocratic English landed garrison in Ireland 
once gone — England's political sway over Ireland will go too! 
Liebknecht has to enter prison for 6 months.— The Anti-Socialists' 
Law ' 6 having failed to overthrow or even to weaken the German So­
cial-Democratic organisation, Bismarck clings the more desperately 
to his panacea, and fancies that it must work, if only applied on a larg-

er scale. Hence he has extended the state of siege 65 to Hamburg, Al­
tana, and 3 other Northern towns. Under these circumstances the 
German friends have written me a letter of which one passage runs 
thus: 
'The Socialist Law, though it could not break and never will break our organisa­
tion, does impose pecuniary sacrifices almost impossible to bear. To support the fami­
lies ruined by the police, to keep alive the few papers left to us, to keep up the necessary 
communications by secret messengers, to fight the battle on the whole line — all this re­
quires money. We are nearly exhausted and forced to appeal to our friends and sym­
pathisers in other countries.' 
So far this extract. 
Now, we, here at London, Paris, etc., will do our best. At the same 
time,  I believe that a man of your influence might organise a sub­
scription in the United States. Even if the monetary result were not 
important, denunciations of Bismarck's new  coup  d'état in public meet­
ings held by you, reported in the American press, reproduced on the 
other side of the Atlantic — would sorely hit the Pomeranian  hobereau a 
and be welcomed by all the socialists of Europe. More information 
you might get from Mr Sorge (Hoboken). Any money forthcoming to 
be sent over to Mr Otto Freytag,  Landtagsabgeordneter, h Amtmannshof, 
Leipzig- His address ought of course not to be made public; otherwise 
the German police would simply confiscate. 
À propos.  My youngest daughter" — who was not with us at Rams-
gate—just tells me that she has cut my portrait from the copy of 
the Capital I sent you, on the pretext that it was a mere caricature. 
Well, I shall make up for it by a photogram to be taken on the first 
fine day. 
Mrs Marx and the whole family send you their best wishes. 
Yours most sincerely, 
Karl Marx

Dear Sorge, 
You must excuse my long silence on the grounds 1. of excessive 
pressure of work, 2. of my wife's exceedingly grave illness which has 
now lasted for something over a year. 
You have yourself seen what JOHN Most has blossomed out into 
and, on the other hand, how wretchedly the so-called party organ, 
the Zurich Sozialdemokrat (not to mention the Jahrbuch* of that 
place) —duce h Dr Höchberg, has been run. As a result Engels and I 
have been constantly engaged in acrimonious exchanges with the 
Leipzigers in the course of which many a hard word has been said. 0 
But we have eschewed any kind of public intervention. It does not 
befit those who are peacefully —  comparativement  parlant d — ensconced 
abroad to contribute to the gratification of government and bour-
geosie by doing anything to aggravate the position of those who are 
operating in the homeland under the most difficult circumstances 
and at considerable personal sacrifice. Liebknecht was here a few 
weeks ago 60 and promised 'improvement' in every respect. The 
party organisation has been revived, something that could only be 
done by secret means, i. e. in so far as 'secret' denotes secret from 
the police. 
It was, believe it or not, in a Russian socialist paperc that I first dis­
covered what a blackguard Most is. He has never dared print in Ger­
man what is to be read here in the Russian VERNACULAR. This isn't just an 
attack on individual persons but a dragging-through-the-mire of the 
entire German  workers'  movement.  At the same time his  utter incomprehension 
of the doctrine in which he used to traffic is grotesquely in evidence. 
It's idle chatter, so silly, so illogical, so abysmal that it finally dissolves 
into the inane,  namely into Johannes Most's unbounded personal vani-

ty.a Having failed, for all his caterwauling, to achieve anything in 
Germany — save, perhaps, among certain hoodlums in Berlin — he 
has allied himself with the Parisian successors of the Bakuninists, the 
group which publishes the Révolution Sociale (its circulation = 210 
EXACTLY, but possesses allies in the shape of Pyat's  Commune.  Pyat, that 
cowardly, melodramatic farceur — in whose  Commune  I figure as Bis­
marck's right-hand man — has a grudge against me for having always 
treated him with the utmost contempt and frustrated all his attempts 
to use the International for his sensation-mongering). At all events 
there's one good thing Most has done, namely to bring together in 
one group all the brawlers — Andreas Scheu, Hasselmann, etc., etc. 
In view of Bismarck's new emergency decrees 65 and the persecution 
of our party members, it is absolutely essential that there should be 
a whip-round  for the party. Yesterday I wrote and said as much to John 
Swintonh (for a well-disposed bourgeois is best suited to this job), at 
the same time telling him that he should refer to you for further infor­
mation about conditions in Germany. 
Apart from the inanities mentioned on the previous page — and 
during our long years of exile how many of the same have we not seen 
explode like squibs and then fizzle out again! — things in general are 
going splendidly (I mean the course of events in Europe as a whole), 
as they are within the confines of the genuinely revolutionary party 
on the Continent. 
You will probably have noticed that the Egalité, in particular, 
(thanks  en première  instance r to Guesde's  having come over to us and to the 
efforts of my son-in-law, Lafargue) has become the first 'French' work­
ers' paper in the true sense of the term. Even Malon — albeit with the 
inconsistencies inseparable from his eclectic nature — has felt bound, 
in his Revue socialiste, (we used to be enemies, he being one of the 
original co-founders of the Alliance  6 7 ) to espouse le socialisme moderne 
scientifique, A i. e. the German  variety. I drew up a ' questionneur'[sic] c for 
him which was first published in the  Revue socialiste  and then reprinted 
in quantity for distribution throughout France. Shortly afterwards 
Guesde came to London to collaborate with us (MYSELF, Engels and 
Lafargue) in drafting an electoral programme 68 for the use of the 
workers in the forthcoming general elections. With the exception of

some foolishnesses such as minimum  wages  fixed by law, etc., which de­
spite our protests Guesde thought fit to dole out to the French work­
ers (I told him that if the French proletariat was so puerile as to re­
quire these sops so is IT  NOT  WORTH WHILE  DRAWING  UP ANY  PROGRAMME WHAT­
EVER), the economic section of this very short document consists (apart 
from some introductory words which define the communist aim in 
a few lines) solely of demands that have, in fact, arisen spontaneously 
out of the workers' movement  itself.  To bring the French workers 
down to earth out of their verbal cloud-cuckoo land was a tre­
mendous step forward, and therefore aroused much resentment 
among all those French intellectual frauds who make a living as 
'cloud-assemblers'. The programme was first adopted, after most 
vigorous opposition on the part of the anarchists, in the Région cen­
trale — i. e. Paris and all its purlieus, and later in many other working-
class areas. The simultaneous formation of opposing workers' 
groups — which (sauf les  anarchistes, a not made up of genuine workers, 
but of déclassé people with a few misguided workers for their rank-
and-file) nevertheless adopted most of the 'practical' demands 
in the programme — as also the ventilation of the most diverse points 
of view in relation to other matters, is to my mind proof that this is the 
first real workers'  movement  in France. Hitherto there have been noth­
ing but sects there which, of course, received their mot d'ordre b from 
their founders, while the bulk of the proletariat followed the radical 
or pseudo-radical bourgeois and fought for them when the day came, 
only to be slaughtered, deported, etc., on the morrow by the very lad­
dies they had placed at the helm. 
The Emancipation, which first came out a few days ago at Lyons, 
will be the organ of the 'parti ouvrier' c— a party that has arisen on the 
basis of German socialism. 
Meanwhile we have also had — and still have — our pioneers in 
the very camp of the enemy — i.e. in the radical camp. Theisz has 
taken on the workers' question in the  Intransigeant,  Rochefort's organ; 
after the defeat of the 'Commune' he, like all 'thinking' French so­
cialists, came to London as a Proudhonist and, while there, changed 
completely as a result of personal intercourse with myself and of 
a conscientious study of Capital. My son-in-law, d for his part, gave 
up his teaching post at King's College,69 went back to Paris (his

family, I'm glad to say, is remaining here for the time being), where 
he became one of the most influential editors of Justice, owned by Cle­
menceau, the leader of the extreme left. He has laboured to such good 
purpose that Clemenceau who, only last April, publicly entered the 
arena as the opponent of socialism and the advocate of the American-
democratic-republican viewpoint, recently made an anti-Gambetta 
speech a at Marseilles, in which, to judge by its general tenor no less 
than its references to the most essential points in the minimum pro­
gramme, he came over to our side. Whether he sticks to what he prom­
ised doesn't really matter. At all events, he has introduced an element 
of ours into the radical party whose organs, comically enough, now 
admire as SOMETHING  WONDERFUL,  on Clemenceau's lips, what had been 
ignored or sneered at by them when merely a catchword emanating 
from the 'parti ouvrier'. 
I need hardly tell you — for you know what French chauvinism is 
like — that the secret strings whereby the LEADERS — from Guesde-
Malon to Clemenceau — have been set in motion, must remain entre 
nous. Il n'en faut pas parler. Quand on veut agir pour Messieurs les 
Français, il faut le faire anonymement, pour ne pas  choquer  le sen­
timent 'national'. b * As it is, the Anarchists denounce our co-
operators already as Prussian agents, under the dictatorship of the 
'notorious' Prussian agent  * — Karl Marx. 
In Russia — where Capital is more widely read and acclaimed than 
anywhere  else  — our success is even greater. On the one hand, we 
have the critics (mostly young university professors, some of them 
personal friends of mine,c  SOME also littérateurs) , on the other, the ter­
rorist Central  Committee, 7 ° whose recent  programme,  clandestinely print­
ed and published in St Petersburg, ' ' aroused considerable ire 
among the anarchist Russians in Switzerland, who bring out The 
Black Redistribution6  (to translate literally from the Russian) in Ge­
neva. Unlike the terrorists, who risk life and limb, these men — most 
of whom (but not all) left Russia of  their own  accord—constitute the so-
called Propaganda Party. (In order to disseminate  propaganda  in Rus­
sia— they remove to  Geneva}.  What a quid pro  quoi)  These gentry are all 
of them opposed to politico-revolutionary action. Russia is to leap

Herewith a card of introduction to my son-in-law Longuet who is 
to introduce you to Rochefort. 
No doubt you will by now have received the letter my wife even­
tually sent off; like all female invalids, she always despairs of the doc­
tors who happen to be attending her. 
With kindest regards, 
Yours very sincerely, 
Karl Marx

MARX  TO  ACHILLE LORIA 72 
IN MANTUA 
London,  13 November  1880 
41 Maitland Park Road,  N. W. 
Dear  Mr  Loria, 
Domestic upsets resulting from  my  wife's very dangerous illness 
have delayed  my  reply  to your letter  of 14 September.73  I regret that 
my lack  of personal means does  not allow  me to  provide  for your stay 
in London,  the  more  so since  I have  the  highest opinion  of your 
talent, your learning  and  your scientific future.  74 
Being  of a  somewhat solitary disposition  and  eschewing  as I do all 
contact with  the  English press,  I have very little influence  and few 
connections  to place  at your disposal.  I know from experience that 
Italian competition,  as regards both contributions  to the  press  and 
private lessons,  is OVERDONE in London,  as in  every other sphere  of the 
struggle  for existence. 
Nevertheless,  on the  re-opening  of Parliament  — until which time 
everyone,  i. e.  THE  UPPER  TEN  THOUSANDS,  deserts  the  metropolis —  I shall 
consult  SOME  WELL-MEANING  AND  INFLUENTIAL  MEN.  In the meantime, perhaps 
you would  be so  kind  as to let me  know whether  you  speak French 
and a modicum  of English. 
Yours very faithfully, 
Karl Marx

MARX TO HENRY MAYERS HYNDMAN 75 
IN LONDON 
[London,] 8 December 1880 
My dear Sir, 
Mrs Marx, like most sickly people whose illness has assumed 
a chronic character, becomes sometimes suddenly unable to leave her 
bedroom and then fit again for social intercourse. Believing she could 
within a few days pay a visit to Mrs Hyndman, she did not write to her 
at once, but as we are this week inundated with visitors from the Con­
tinent, she begs me to write you that she will give herself the pleasure 
to call upon Mrs Hyndman next week. 
I welcome the prospect of the journal you speak of. If you say that 
you do not share the views of my party for England I can only reply 
that that party considers an English revolution not  necessary,  but — 
according to historic precedents—possible. If the unavoidable evolu­
tion turn into a revolution, it would not only be the fault of the ruling 
classes, but also of the working class. Every pacific concession of the 
former has been wrung from them by 'pressure from without1. Their 
action kept pace with that pressure and if the latter has more and 
more weakened, it is only because the English working class know not 
how to wield their power and use their liberties, both of which they 
possess legally. 
In Germany the working class were fully aware from the beginning 
of their movement that you cannot get rid of a military despotism but 
by a Revolution. At the same time they understood that such a Revo­
lution, even if at first successful, would finally turn against them with­
out previous organisation, acquirement of knowledge, propaganda, 
and [word illegible]. Hence they moved within strictly legal 
bounds. The illegality was all on the side of government, which de­
clared them en  dehors  la loi. a Their crimes were not  deeds,  but opinions 
unpleasant to their rulers. Fortunately, the same government — the 
working class having been pushed to the background with the help of 
the bourgeoisie — becomes now more and more unbearable to the 
a beyond the law

London, 24 December 1880 
Dear Old Man, 
This is to advise you in all haste that I have taken out a money 
order for you for five pounds sterling = 126 frs, which I trust you will 
receive. 
When Liebknecht was here 6 ° I hauled him over the coals for hav­
ing failed so much as to consider you when distributing the relief 
fund. I told him you were just as much, if not more, a victim of the 
Anti-Socialist Law '6  as many of the Berliners, amongst whom there 
are some notorious blackguards. Now he has written to say: Becker 
will be cared for. So make sure this is done and, if not and supposing it 
embarrasses you to dun them, drop me a line and I'll see to it for you. 
Better luck in the New Year. 
Your old friend,

MARX TO CHARLES LONGUET 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 4 January 1881 
Dear Longuet, 
With the immense agglomerate of old newspapers it would take me 
too much time to find out The Eastern Post which contains the contro­
versy of the General Council (inclus, its Communard members) with 
the illustrious Bradlaugh. 376 However, I suppose Lessner will have 
the Post ready at hand. This, however, is for you the least important 
thing. That Bradlaugh denounced the Communards, that he repro­
duced the worst calumnies, as you told him then in the Post,h  of such 
papers as the Liberté, the Soir, that he fell foul of the manifesto of the 
General Council on 'The Civil War in France'/ etc., this will hardly 
damage him in the eyes of the Paris bourgeoisie. Still the thing may 
be shortly hinted at as characteristic of the man. In an answer of the 
General Secretary of the General Council (it was Hales, but that 
man must not be honoured by naming him) to Bradlaugh (in The 
Eastern Post,  September  1871), he said amongst other things: 
'...The wanton destruction of private dwellings (by Thiers' bombardment) was the 
work of Mr Bradlaugh's friends... Rochefort has been sentenced under the Republic to 
transportation for life for a press offence. Fancy Mr Bradlaugh being transported for 
life for his utterances!'" 1 
The important thing is that Bradlaugh was denounced by the 
General Council (extracts of whose sittings were reported by The 
a 'Mr Bradlaugh and the International', The Eastern Post, No. 173, 20 January 1872. -
b 'Mr Bradlaugh and the Communists', The Eastern Post, No. 168, 16 December

tional Working Men's  Association.  -d J. Hales, 'To the Editor of The  Eastern  Post', The East-

Eastern Post) as a Courtesan of Plön-Plön (he was at London then) 
and because of his suspect relations in Paris.  " In the sitting of the 
General Council of  December  19, 1871 I (informed by the Frenchman, 
who wrote under the name Azamouth or another Turkish name, and 
who was informed by a lady — probably the Brimont, present at 
social gathering later on referred to) denounced a recent trip of Brad-
laugh's to Paris, where he associated with Détroyat and Emile de 
Girardin. In his honour the latter gave a dinner where equivocuous, 
i. e. Bonapartist, ladies assisted and where Bradlaugh rendered him­
self ridiculous by the boastful display of his pretended London 
influence. 
If Bradlaugh says that the Brimont was a great patriot, at the 
time he made her acquaintance, he may be fully believed. Before the 
battle of Sedan all Bonapartists were so far patriots that they wished 
victory to their Emperor.b  After the battle of Sedan they still re­
mained patriots, because, from their standpoint, France could only be 
saved by Louis Bonaparte's restauration, even if that restauration 
must be accomplished by the aid of Bismarck. 
It is self-understood that you must not  name  me. As to the details of 
Bradlaugh's intimacy with the Brimont, Blanc  {le vieux) c is the man to 
furnish them. 
In his controversy with the General Council Bradlaugh got the 
help — of the Soir (Paris journal). In the Council's sitting of January 2, 
1872 Serraillier communicated: 
'He had read an article in Le Soir written in defence of Bradlaugh. It said he (Brad­
laugh) had  honoured the  Journal (Le Soir) by contributing  to it and was a safe governmental 
man, and had nothing to do with demagogic intrigues.' 
When Gladstone dissolved Parliament (the occasion on which he 
was overthrown by Disraeli), Bradlaugh's lecturing room was decorat­
ed by immense placards with the inscription 'Farewell to Iconoclast, 
the People's Redeemer! Welcome to the great dreadnaught of St 
Stephen's!' " But he had counted without his host. He was not el­
ected member of Parliament, despite his public begging letters (for 
a good testimonial) to Bright and other leaders of the 'great liberal 
party', who replied in a very cool way. It was also no use boasting of 
having dined with a life-Bishop (of the church of England).

In the last election1  Bradlaugh was happier for this reason: He was 
one of the noisiest demagogic supporters of Gladstone's pro-Russian 
campaign against Disraeli — in fact one of the most turbulent tools of 
the Party who wanted to get in 'Place and Pelf again,  coûte que coûte. b 
Moreover, no constituency was to be hazarded in the impending, de­
cisive electoral battle. The prudery of the Whig and radical party 
had to be thrown overboard. Now Bradlaugh's election at Nort­
hampton was not safe, despite the strong contingent of shoemakers in 
that town who belong to his 'sect'; but these shoemakers had before 
voted for him like one man, and he had failed. But then there was 
another liberal candidate, difficult to place, because notorious for his 
'affaires  véreuses en matière  de finances' c and moreover damaged by some 
scandals of another sort  (des gifles refus) .d This man was Labouchere. 
He is one of the three proprietors of The Daily News, hence the part­
ner ofthat gros  bonnet"  of the liberal party—the pietist capitalist Sa­
muel Morley. Difficult as it was to carry through either Bradlaugh or 
Labouchere, it was feasible to do so by making a  couple  of them. Sa­
muel Morley's — the pietist's — public recommendation (by printed 
letter) of the atheist Bradlaugh secured him the religious element of 
Northampton, while Bradlaugh secured to Labouchere the infidel 
shoemakers of that town. Thus both together passed as members for 
Northampton. 
The utter meanness of Bradlaugh shines most in the manoeuvres by 
which he has succeeded to oust all the other popular preachers of free 
thought (the scientific preachers address themselves to other  couches 
sociales f) such as Mrs Law, who wanted not to be his personal séides, g 
by appropriating to himself all the funds of the party. He even suc­
ceeded to have all lecturing halls in London shut to them, while he 
built out of the party's funds a lecturing hall for his own personal use. 
Mrs Law etc. were so confined to lecturing in the provinces. If it inter­
ests you (but I think it is not worth while entering into details), you 
can have full information on this point from the persons concerned.

Can you give me some information on a person named E. Fortin 
who has written me several letters addressing me as: 'Mon  cher  maître. ' 
His demand is very 'modest'. While he studies the Capital he pro­
poses to make monthly  résumés  which he is kind enough to be wil­
ling to send over to me monthly, whereupon I shall correct them 
monthly, elucidating the points he might have misunderstood. In 
this quiet way, when he had done with the last monthly résumé, 
and I sent it back corrected — he would have a manuscript ready 
for publication and — as he says — inundate France with torrents 
de lumière.  " 
Now I shall — even for mere want of time — not answer to his call, 
but at all events I must reply to his letter. He may be a well-
intentioned man. Before writing him I should like to have some infor­
mation. He resides at present at Beauvais, 22, rue de la Porte de Paris.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 79 
IN VIENNA 
London, 1 February 1881 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Mr Kautsky, 
Having been long prevented, I am at last able to reply to your let­
ter.80 
Now, in view of the fact that you intend to come here shortly, it 
would be a somewhat unnecessary labour to let you have a detailed 
critique in writing of the book you have been good enough to send me; 
since I shall, in all probability, have the pleasure of discussing it with 
you in person, I shall confine myself to just a few points. 
1. What you say on p. 66 etc. is invalidated by the fact that other, 
real differences exist between surplus value and profit on capital be­
sides the percentage estimate based on the variable or total capital. 
The main passages from Capital relating to this are summarised in 
Anti-Dühring, p. 182. 81 
2. Even if the armchair socialists82 persist in demanding that we 
proletarian socialists should help them solve the problem of how to 
avoid what looks like imminent over-population and the threat of  col­
lapse this poses to the new social order, that is very far from being 
a reason why I should do them such a favour. To resolve all the

doubts and scruples of these chaps which they owe to the excess of 
their own muddle-headed wisdom, or even to refute, for example, all 
the monstrous twaddle which Schäffle alone has assembled in his 
many fat tomes, 83 is, in my opinion, a sheer waste of time. It would 
fill a fair-sized book were one merely to attempt to put right all the 
misquotations  from Capital inserted by these gentlemen between invert­
ed commas.They should first learn to read and copy before demand­
ing to have their questions answered. 
Moreover, I do not regard the question as in any way a burning 
one at a moment when American mass production, as yet only in its 
infancy, and really large-scale agriculture are threatening to all but 
suffocate us by the sheer volume of the means of subsistence pro­
duced; on the eve of an upheaval of which one of the first conse­
quences must be to populate the  globe  — what you say on the subject 
on pp. 169-70, skates too lightly over this point — and which, more­
over, will of  necessity  call for considerable demographic growth in 
Europe. 
Euler's calculation 84 has about as much merit as the one concern­
ing the kreutzer which, invested at compound interest in the year dot, 
doubles every 13 years and therefore now amounts to some 
1 x 2 144 ——— gulden, a silver nugget larger than the earth. When you 
60 
say on p. 169 that social conditions in America are not very different 
from those in Europe, this holds good only so long as you consider 
nothing but the large coastal cities, or even the outward legal forms 
those conditions assume. There can be no doubt that the vast mass of 
the American people live in conditions that are exceedingly favour­
able to demographic growth. The stream of immigrants is proof of 
this. And yet it has taken more than 30 years to double  itself.  Alarm-
ism doesn't come into it. 
The abstract possibility that mankind will increase numerically to 
such an extent that its propagation will have to be kept within 
bounds does, of course, exist. But should communist society ever find 
itself compelled to regulate the production of humans in the same 
way as it has already regulated the production of things, then it, and 
it alone, will be able to effect this without difficulty. In such a society 
it would not, or so it seems to me, be particularly difficult to obtain 
deliberately a result which has already come about naturally and 
haphazardly in France and Lower Austria. At all events, it's for those 
chaps to decide whether, when and how it's to be done and what

means they wish to use. I don't consider myself qualified to supply 
them with suggestions and advice about this. Indeed, these chaps 
will, presumably, be every bit as clever as we are. 
Incidentally, as early as 1844 I wrote  {Deutsch-Französische  Jahr­
bücher,  p. 109): 'For even if Malthus were completely right, this' (so­
cialist) 'transformation would have to be undertaken straight away; 
for only this transformation, only the education of the masses which it 
provides, makes possible that moral restraint of the propagative in­
stinct which Malthus himself presents as the most effective and easiest 
remedy for over-population.' a 
That must suffice until I am able to discuss the other points with 
you in person. You are quite right to come over here. You are one of 
the few among the younger generation who really tries to learn some­
thing, and hence it will do you a lot of good to get out of the atmo­
sphere of non-criticism in which all the historical and economic lite­
rature currently being produced in Germany is going to wrack and 
ruin.

The 5 nos. of the Sozialdemokrat since the year began testify to 
a significant step forward. Gone are the melancholy, despairing tones 
of a 'beaten man', the complementary grandiloquence of stuffy re­
spectability, the incessant revolutionary rhetoric à la Most alternat­
ing with philistine tameness, finally the constant preoccupation with 
Most. The tone has become lively and purposeful. The paper will no 
longer act as an opiate if it stays like this; rather it will put new heart 
into our people in Germany. As you have the Neue  Rheinische  Zeitung 
you would do well to take a look at it occasionally. The mockery and 
contempt with which we treated our opponents were precisely what 
brought us in almost 6,000 subscribers in the 6 months prior to the 
state of siege 85 and, although we started again from scratch in No­
vember, we again had the full tally and more by May '49. The Kölni­
sche Zeitung has now admitted that in those days it only had 
9,000. 
As it seems that you are short of material for your feuilleton, you 
might, sometime, reprint the poem from No. 44 of 1848: 'This morn­
ing I went to Düsseldorf; possibly with the title 'A Socialist-Eater of 
1848'  (feuilleton to the Neue  Rheinische  Z^eitung  of 14 July 1848) and,

In all haste these few lines in answer to your friendly letter. 
Since my return from Ramsgate 38 my health was generally im­
proving, but the detestable weather, lasting for months, we are pass­
ing through, has blessed me with a perpetual cold and coughing, in­
terfering with sleep, etc. But the worst is that Mrs Marx's state be­
comes daily more dangerous notwithstanding my resort to the most 
celebrated medical men of London, and I have besides a host of

domestic troubles, which it would be tedious entering upon. On the 
other hand, I had and have to struggle through an immense lot of 
blue books8  9 sent to me from different countries, above all from the 
United States, so that my working time is hardly sufficient for the 
task, since all night labour has for many years absolutely been inter­
dicted by my medical advisers. Hence an awful correspondence-
indebtedness starts me in the face. Just now my whole family is in 
a hubbub because of the removal of my eldest daughter, Madame 
Longuet, with her children, a from London to Paris, where her hus­
bandb— (since the amnesty; he was in the interval Professor of 
King's College, London) 69 — has become one of the editors of the 
Justice (he inspired Clemenceau's semi-socialistic speech at Marseillesc). 
You understand how painful — in the present state of Mrs Marx — 
this separation must be. For her and myself our grandchildren, three 
little boys, were inexhaustible sources of enjoyment, of life. 
Now first as to the enclosed manuscript.90 Its author, Mr Lafargue, 
is the husband of my second daughter,d and one of my direct dis­
ciples.  He has requested me to try whether through your interference 
he could become a contributor to a Petersburg Review, the Omeuecm-
eeHHbiH 3anucKu  or the  Cjioeo.  (I think they are the only ones where he 
might have a chance.) If so, you would be empowered to change or 
suppress anything not suitable to the St Petersburg Meridian. As to 
his 'name', the initials would do. At all events it will interest you to 
read the manuscript. 
I have read with the greatest interest your article  5 6 which is in the 
best sense of the word 'original'. Hence the Boycotting. If you break 
through the webs of routine thought, you are always sure to be 'boy­
cotted' in the first instance; it is the only arm of defence which in their 
first perplexity the  routiniers  know how to wield. I have been 'boycot­
ted' in Germany for many many years, and am still so in England, 
with that little variation that from time to time something so absurd 
and asinine is launched against me that I would blush to take any 
public notice of it. But try on: The next thing to do — in my opin­
ion— is to take up the wonderfully increasing indebtedness of the 
landlords, the upper class representatives of agriculture, and show 
them how they are 'crystallised' in the retort under the control of the 
'new pillars of society'.

62 41. Marx to Danielson. 19 February 1881 
I am very anxious to see your polemics with the Cjioeo.9  ' As soon as 
I shall sail in more quiet waters I shall enter more fully upon your Es­
quisse.  " For the present I cannot omit one observation. The soil being 
exhausted and getting not the elements — by artificial and vegetable 
and animal manure, etc.— to supply its wants, will with the changing 
favour of the seasons, of circumstances independent of human in­
fluence— still continue to yield harvests of very different amounts, 
though, summing up a period of  years,  as f. i. from 1870-80, the stag­
nant character of the production presents itself in the most striking 
character. Under such circumstances the favourable climatic condi­
tions pave the way to a famine year by quickly consuming and setting 
free the mineral fertilizers still latent in the soil, while  vice versa  a. fam­
ine year, and still more a series of bad years following it, allow the 
soil-inherent minerals to accumulate anew, and to work efficiently 
with returning favour of the climatic conditions. Such a process goes 
of course everywhere on but  elsewhere  it is checked by the modifying 
intervention of the agriculturist  himself.  It becomes the only regulat­
ing factor where man has ceased to be a 'power' — for want of means. 
So we have  1870  an excellent harvest in your country, but that year 
is a climax year, and as such immediately followed by a very bad one; 
the year  1871,  the very bad harvest, must be considered as the starting 
point for a new little cycle, till we come to the new climax year 1874, 
which is immediately followed by the famine year 1875; then the up­
wards movement begins again, ending in the still worse famine year 
1880.  The summing up of the years during the whole period proves 
that the average annual production remained the same and that the 
mere natural factors have alone produced the changes comparing the 
single years and the smaller cycles of years. 
I wrote you some time ago,b  that if the great industrial and com­
mercial crisis England has passed through went over without the cul­
minating financial crash at London, this exceptional phenomenon 
was only due to — French money. This is now seen and acknowl­
edged even by English  routiniers.  Thus The Statist (January 29, 1881) 
says: 
'The money market has only be[en] so easy as it has been during the past year 
through  an accident.  The Bank of  France  in the early autumn permitted its stock of gold

a very narrow escape.' (!) 
The English railway system rolls on the same inclined plane as the 
European Public Debt  system.  The ruling magnates amongst the differ­
ent railway-nets directors contract not only — progressively — new 
loans in order to enlarge their networks, i. e. the 'territory', where they 
rule as absolute monarchs, but they enlarge their respective networks 
in order  to have new pretexts for  engaging  in new loans which enable them 
to pay the interest due to the holders of obligations, preferential 
shares, etc., and also from time to time to throw a sop to the much ill-
used common shareholders in the shape of somewhat increased divi­
dends.  This pleasant method must one day or another terminate in 
an ugly catastrophe. 
In the United States the railway kings have become the butt of at­
tacks,  not only, as before this, on the part of the farmers and other in­
dustrial  'entrepreneurs'  of the West, but also on the part of the grand 
representative of commerce — the New York  Chamber  of Commerce.  The 
octopodus railway king and financial swindler Gould has, on his side, 
told the New York commercial magnates: 
You now attack the railways, because you think them most vulnerable considering 
their present unpopularity; but take heed: after the railways every sort of  corporation 
(means in the Yankee dialect joint stock  company)  will have its turn; then, later on, all 
forms of  associated  capital; finally, all forms of  capital;  you are thus paving the way 
to —  Communism  whose tendencies are already more and more spreading among the 
people.

In India serious complications, if not a general outbreak, is in store 
for the British government. What the English take from them an­
nually in the form of rent, dividends for railways useless to the Hin­
doos,  pensions for military and civil servicemen, for Afghanistan and 
other wars, etc. etc.— what they take from them without any  equivalent 
and quite apart from what they appropriate to themselves annually 
within India, speaking only of the value of  the commodities  the Indians 
have  gratuitously  and annually to send  over  to England, it amounts to 
more than the total sum of  income  of the 60 millions of  agricultural  and 
industrial labourers of  India).  This is a bleeding process, with a ven­
geance! The famine years are pressing each other and in  dimensions  till

MARX TO FERDINAND DOMELA NIEUWENHUIS 95 
IN THE HAGUE 
London, 22 February 1881 
41 Maitland Park Road, N.W. 
Dear Comrade, 
My prolonged silence is due to the fact that I wished to enclose in 
my reply to your letter of  6 January a conspectus of the amendments 
that you might care to make in the event of a 2nd edition of Kapitaal 
en Arbeid.96 As a result of domestic disturbances, unforeseen labours 
and other disruptions, I have not yet got this done and shall therefore 
be sending off this letter without the enclosure for the present, lest my 
continued silence be misconstrued by you. The amendments I con­
sider necessary relate to details; the main thing, the spirit of the thing, 
is there already. 
I have to thank you for the kind dedication,9  7 since you, person­
ally, have thereby thrown down the gauntlet before our bourgeois 
antagonists. 
The authora  of Mannen van beteekenis,  9 8 an inspector of schools  OR 
SOMETHING  OF THAT SORT, wrote to me requesting material for a biograph­
ical memoir and, in addition, got his publisher to approach my 
brother-in-law, Juta, with a view to his persuading me to accede to 
a request of the kind I habitually turn down. The gentleman — the 
author of Mannen — wrote to me saying he did not share my views but 
recognised their importance, protested his esteem, etc. The selfsame 
individual subsequently had the effrontery to embody in his pam­
phlet a libellous fabrication by that notorious Prussian spy, Stieber, 
and likewise, — on the inspiration, no doubt, of one of the armchair 
socialists 82 in Bonn, — to accuse me of deliberate misquotation, nor, 
in so doing, did the estimable fellow even go to the trouble of reading 
up my polemic against the worthy Brentano in the Volksstaat, 9 9 
where he would have seen that Brentano, who had originally de­
nounced me in the  Concordia  (manufacturers' sheet) for 'formal and 
substantive falsification', later extricated himself with the lie that he

had misunderstood me, etc. A Dutch journal proposed to open its col­
umns to me for the chastisement of the 'inspector of schools', but on 
principle I do not reply to pin-pricks of this kind. I have never, even 
in London, taken the slightest notice of such literary yapping. Any 
other course would mean wasting the better part of my time on mak­
ing rectifications all over the place, from California to Moscow. 
In my younger days I sometimes did some hard hitting, but wis­
dom comes with age, at least in so far as one avoids useless DISSIPATION 
OF FORCE. 
The forthcoming Zurich Congress's 'question' which you mention 
would seem to me a mistake. 10° What is to be done, and done imme­
diately at any given, particular moment in the future, depends, of 
course, wholly and entirely on the actual historical circumstances in 
which action is to be taken. But the said question, being posed out of 
the blue, in fact poses a fallacious problem to which the only answer 
can be a critique of  the question  as such. We cannot solve an equation 
that does not comprise within its terms the elements of its solution. 
Come to that, there is nothing specifically 'socialist' about the predi­
caments of a government that has suddenly come into being as a re­
sult of a popular victory. On the contrary. Victorious bourgeois poli­
ticians immediately feel constrained by their 'victory', whereas a so­
cialist is at least able to intervene without constraint. Of one thing 
you may be sure — a socialist government will not come to the helm 
in a country unless things have reached a stage at which it can, before 
all else, take such measures as will so intimidate the mass of the bour­
geoisie as to achieve the first desideratum — time for effective action. 
You may, perhaps, refer me to the Paris Commune but, aside from 
the fact that this was merely an uprising of one city in exceptional cir­
cumstances, the majority of the Commune was in no sense socialist, 
nor could it have been. With a modicum of COMMON SENSE, it could, 
however, have obtained the utmost that was then obtainable — a 
compromise with Versailles beneficial to the people as a whole. The 
appropriation of the Banque de France alone would have rapidly put 
an end to the vainglory of Versailles, etc., etc. 
The general demands of the French bourgeoisie before 1789 were, 
mutatis mutandis,a just as well-defined as are today, with a fair degree 
of uniformity, the primary, immediate demands of the proletariat in 
all countries where there is capitalist production. But could any 18th-
a the necessary changes being made

century Frenchman, a priori, have the least idea of the manner in 
which the demands of the French bourgeoisie would be implement­
ed? A doctrinaire and of necessity fantastic anticipation of a future 
revolution's programme of action only serves to distract from the pres­
ent struggle. The dream of the imminent end of the world inspired 
the struggle of the early Christians against the Roman Empire and 
gave them confidence in victory. Scientific insight into the inevitable 
disintegration, now steadily taking place before our eyes, of the pre­
vailing social order; the masses themselves, their fury mounting under 
the lash of the old governmental bogies; the gigantic and positive ad­
vances simultaneously taking place in the development of the means 
of production — all this is sufficient guarantee that the moment 
a truly proletarian revolution breaks out, the conditions for its imme­
diate initial (if certainly not idyllic)  modus  operandi" 1 will also be there. 
My own conviction is that the critical conjuncture for a new inter­
national working men's association has not yet arrived; hence I con­
sider all labour congresses and /or socialist congresses, in so far as they 
do not relate to the immediate, actual conditions obtaining in this or 
that specific nation, to be not only useless but harmful. They will in­
variably fizzle out in a host of rehashed generalised banalities. 
Yours most cordially, 
Karl Marx

ENGELS TO JENNY LONGUET 101 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 24 February 1881 
My dear Jenny, 
Well may the illustrious Regnard recommend his factum to your 
'charity'.102 This Jacobin defending English respectable Protestant-
a mode of operation 

=====第96页=====
68 43. Engels to Jenny Longuet. 24 February 1881 
ism and English vulgar Liberalism with the historical appareil of 
that same vulgar Liberalism is indeed an object of deepest charity. 
But to his 'facts'. 
1) The 30,000 protestants' massacre of 1641. The Irish Catholics 
are here in the same position as the Commune de Paris. The Ver-
saillais massacred 30,000 Communards and called that the horrors of 
the Commune. The English protestants under Cromwell massacred 
at least 30,000 Irish and, to cover their brutality,  invented  the tale that 
this was to avenge 30,000 protestants murdered by the Irish Catho­
lics. 
The facts are these. 
Ulster having been taken from its Irish owners who at that time 
1600-1610 held the land in common, and handed over to Scotch prot­
estant military colonists, these colonists did not feel safe in their pos­
sessions in the troublous times after 1640. The puritan English Gov­
ernment officials in Dublin spread the rumour that a Scotch Army of 
Covenanters 103 was to land in Ulster and exterminate all Irish and 
Catholics. Sir W. Parsons, one of the two Chief Justices of Ireland, 
said that in a 12-month there would not be a Catholic left in Ireland. 
It was under these menaces, repeated in the English Parliament, that 
the Irish of Ulster rose on 23rd October 1641. But no massacre took 
place. All contemporaneous sources ascribe to the Irish merely the in­
tention of a general massacre, and even the two protestant Chief  Jus­
tices (proclam. 8th February 1642) declare that 'the chief part of 
their plot, and amongst them a general massacre, had been  disappoint­
ed.' The English and Scotch however, 4th May 1642, threw Irish 
women naked into the river (Newry) and massacred Irishmen. (Pren-
dergast, Cromwellian Settlement of  Ireland,  1865.) 
2) L'Irlande la Vendée de l'Angleterre. 104 Ireland was Catholic, 
Protestant England Republican, therefore Ireland — English Ven­
dée. There is however this little difference that the French Revolution 
intended to give the land to the people, the English Commonwealth 
intended, in Ireland, to take the land from the people. 
The whole Protestant reformation, as is well known to most stu­
dents of history save Regnard, apart from its dogmatical squabbles 
and quibbles, was a vast plan for a confiscation of land. First the land 
was taken from the Church. Then the Catholics, in countries where 
Protestantism was in power, were declared rebels and their land con­
fiscated. 
Now in Ireland the case was peculiar. 

=====第97页=====
43. Engels to Jenny Longuet. 24 February 1881 69 
'For the English,' says Prendergast, 'seem to have thought that god made a mistake 
in giving such a fine country as Ireland to the Irish; and for nearly 700 years they have 
been trying to remedy it.' 
The whole agrarian history of Ireland is a series of confiscations of 
Irish land to be handed over to English settlers. These settlers, in 
a very few generations, under the charm of Celtic society, turned 
more Irish than the aborigines. Then a new confiscation and new col­
onization took place, and so in infinitum. 
In the 17th century, the whole of Ireland except the newly Scotchi-
fied North, was ripe for a fresh confiscation. So much so, that when 
the British (puritan) Parliament accorded to Charles I an army for 
the reduction of Ireland, it resolved that the money for this arma­
ment should be raised  upon the security  of2,500,000  acres to be confiscated  in 
Ireland.  And the 'adventurers' 105  who advanced the money should 
also appoint the officers of that army. The land was to be divided 
amongst those adventurers so that 1,000 acres should be given them, 
if in Ulster for £ 200.- advanced, in Connaught for £ 300, in Mun­
ster for £ 450, in Leinster for £ 600. And if the people rose against this 
beneficent plan they are Vendéens! If Regnard should ever sit in 
a National Convention, he may take a leaf out of the proceedings of 
the Long Parliament, 106 and combat a possible Vendée with these 
means. 
The Abolition of the Penal Laws107! Why the greater part of them 
were repealed, not in 1793 but in 1778, when England was threat­
ened by the rise of the American Republic, and the second repeal, 
1793,  was when the French Republic arose threatening and England 
required all the soldiers she could get to fight it! 
The Grant to Maynooth by Pitt. 108  This pittance was soon re­
pealed by the Tories and only renewed by Sir R. Peel in 1845. But 
not a word about the other cadeau que faisait à l'Irlande  ce grand  homme 
{c'est la  première  fois qu'il trouve grâce devant les yeux d'un Jacobin),* 
that other 'dotation' not only  'considérable'  but actually lavish — the 
3 Million £by which the Union of Ireland with England 109 was 
bought. The parliamentary documents will show that the one item of 
the purchase money of rotten and nomination boroughs alone cost no 
less a sum than £1,245,000 (O'Connell, Memoir on Ireland  addressed  to 
the Queen). 
* present this great man gave to Ireland (it is the first time that grace has been bes­
towed upon him in the eyes of the Jacobins)

Lord Derby instituted le système des  écoles  nationales.  l ' ° Very true 
but why did he? Consult Fitzgibbon, Ireland in 1868, the work of a 
staunch Protestant and Tory, or else the official Report of Commis­
sioners on Education in Ireland, 1826. The Irish, neglected by the 
English government, had taken the education of their children into 
their own hands. At the time when English fathers and mothers in­
sisted upon their right to send their children to the factory to earn 
money instead of to the school to learn, at that time in Ireland the 
peasants vied with each other in forming schools of their own. The 
school-master was an ambulant teacher, spending a couple of months 
at each village. A cottage was found for him, each child paid him 2d. 
a week and a few sods of turf in winter. The schools were kept, on fine 
days in summer, in the fields, near a hedge, and then known by the 
name of hedge-schools. There were also ambulant scholars, who with 
their books under the arm, wandered from school to school, receiving 
lodging and food from the peasants without difficulty. In 1812 there 
were 4,600 such hedge-schools in Ireland and that year's report of the 
Commissioners says that such education 
was 'leading to evil rather than good', 'that such education  the people are actually  ob­
taining for  themselves,  and though we consider it practicable to correct it, to  check  its pro­
gress  appears  impossible:  it may be improved but it cannot be impeded'. 
So then, these truly national schools did not suit English purposes. 
To suppress them, the sham national schools were established. They 
are so little secular that the reading-book consists of extracts both 
from the Catholic and Protestant Bibles, agreed upon by the Catho­
lic and Protestant Archbishops of Dublin. Compare with these Irish 
peasants the English who howl at compulsory school attendance to 
this day!

Dear Citizen, 
A nervous complaint which has assailed me periodically over the 
last ten years has prevented me from replying any sooner to your let­
ter of 16 February. I am sorry that I cannot provide you with a con­
cise exposé, intended for publication, of the question you have done 
me the honour of putting to me. Months ago I promised the St Peters­
burg Committee to let them have a piece on the same subject. ' ' 2 
I hope, however, that a few lines will suffice to dispel any doubts you 
may harbour as to the misunderstanding in regard to my so-called 
theory. 
In analysing the genesis of capitalist production I say: 
'At the core of the capitalist system, therefore, lies the complete 
separation of the producer from the means of production ... the basis 
of this whole development is the  expropriation  of the agricultural  producer. 
To date this has not been accomplished in a radical fashion anywhere 
except in England... But all the other  countries  of Western Europe are 
undergoing the same process' (Capital, French ed., p. 315). 
Hence the 'historical inevitability' of this process is  expressly  limited 
to the  countries  of Western  Europe. The cause of that limitation is indi­
cated in the following passage from Chapter XXXII: 
'Private  property,  based on personal labour ... will be supplanted by 
capitalist private property, based on the exploitation of the labour of 
others, on wage labour' (I.e., p. 341). 
In this Western movement, therefore, what is taking place is the 
transformation of  one  form of  private  property into  another  form of  private 
property. In the case of the Russian peasants, their communal 
property would, on the contrary, have to be transformed into private 
property. 
Hence the analysis provided in Capital does not adduce reasons 
either for or against the viability of the rural commune, but the spe­
cial study I have made of it, and the material for which I drew from

original sources, has convinced me that this commune is the fulcrum 
of social regeneration in Russia, but in order that it may function as 
such, it would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences 
which are assailing it from all sides, and then ensure for it the normal 
conditions of spontaneous development. 
I have the honour to be, dear Citizen,

Dear Mr Kaufmann, 
In reply to your esteemed note of the 9th inst. I regret that I am 
unable to fall in with your wishes regarding the guarantee. My expe­
riences with guarantees have been such that I have resolved once and 
for all to advance the money straight away  myself,  if I can, rather 
than give a guarantee. However the money is not available; if I had it 
and could do without it, I should regard it as my prime duty to hand 
it over to the party in Germany to whom we now owe every penny we 
can spare.a 
a Here Engels deleted the following passage: 'There is, however, another reason. Over 
the past 10 years I have seen all too often how rapid is the turnover here of the people 
who go to make up the local German working men's associations and, such being the 
case,  it might well come about that the Society 8 adopted a line quite different from its 
present one before my guarantee expired and that in the last resort I was standing gua­
rantee for Mr Most, which surely cannot be asked of me.'

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN ' 13 
IN ZURICH 
London, 12 March 1881 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Herewith some material on the anti-adultery commandment. ' '4 
Whether you'll be able to use it, I confess I don't know. It's a ticklish 
subject and you must know whether more harm than good will be 
done by touching on it. At all events I wanted to show you one way of 
dealing with this commandment without relapsing into moral philis-
tinism, and it may be useful to you anyway to have the historical ma­
terial on the case, in so far as it was available to me. 
For the rest, the papera  is doing very well on the whole and some of 
the nos. are very good; rather less doctrinaire articles, like the one on 
state socialism, b would do no harm. How can one lump together Tur-
got, one of the leading economists of the 18th century, with Necker, 
that highly practical man of  haute  finance,c  precursor of your Laffittes 
and Péreires and, worse still, the wretched Calonne, the man of 
hand-to-mouth expedients, who was a genuine  après  moi le déluge 0 ' '5 
aristocrat? How can one place these — Turgot in particular and even 
Necker — cheek by jowl with Bismarck who, at the most, wants 
money regardless, à la Calonne, and the said Bismarck in his turn 
quite summarily cheek by jowl with Stoecker on the one hand and 
Schäffle and Co. on the other, every one of whom in his turn 
pursues quite different lines? If the bourgeois lump them all together,

that is no reason why we should proceed as uncritically. Here, pre­
cisely, are the roots of doctrinairism, in that one believes the  self-
interested and narrow assertions of one's opponent and proceeds to 
construct on those assertions a system which naturally stands or falls 
with them. With Bismarck it is a case of money, money and again 
money, and the pretexts he gives change in accordance with purely 
external considerations. Give him a differently composed majority 
in the Reichstag and he'll jettison all his present plans and prepare 
conflicting ones. That's why one can never ever infer a declaration of 
modern society's bankruptcy from anything that is done by an ani­
mal as irrational in theory and inconsistent in practice as Bismarck. 
Still less from the intellectual St Vitus dance of a fool like Stoecker. 
Nor yet from the twaddle of'thinking men' à la Schäme. Their 'think­
ing' (and this is pretty well all they do 'think') is not directed 
towards declaring modern society bankrupt. On the contrary, they 
are, of course, simply living in the hope of patching it up again. But 
what kind of a thinking man is e.g. Schäffle? In his Quintessenz" the 
silly Swabian admits that he pondered one of the (simplest) points in 
Capital for ten years before getting to the bottom of  it; in fact the bot­
tom he got to was pure nonsense. ' ' 6 
It is nothing but self-interested misrepresentation on the part of the 
Manchester bourgeois to describe as 'socialism' all interference by the 
state with free competition: protective tariffs, guilds, tobacco monop­
oly, nationalisation of branches of industry, the Overseas Trading 
Company, ' ' ' royal porcelain factory. That is something we should 
criticise, but not  believe.  If we do the latter and base a theoretical ar­
gument thereon, this will collapse together with its premisses,— 
simply upon it's being proved, that is, that this alleged socialism is 
nothing but feudal reaction on the one hand and, on the other, a pre­
text for extortion, its secondary object being to turn as many proleta­
rians as possible into officials and pensioners dependent on the state, 
and to organise, alongside the disciplined army of officials and mili­
tary, a similar army of workers. Compulsory suffrage imposed by se­
nior functionaries instead of by factory overseers — fine socialism 
that! This is where you get if you believe what the bourgeois himself 
doesn't believe but only pretends to, namely that the state = so­
cialism. 
Otherwise I find that your views on the attitude to be adopted by

the paper coincide entirely with my own, and I'm also glad that of 
late there has no longer been such liberal use of the word revolution as 
there was at the outset. That was quite all right earlier on, after the 
sorry opiate-mongering of 1880, ' '8  but it would be preferable, and 
this, too, with an eye to Most, to be wary of high-flown rhetoric. One 
may express revolutionary thoughts without forever harping on the 
word revolution. The pitiful Most is, by the way, quite beside  himself; 
he's at a loss where to pull in and now, on top ofthat, the success of 
Fritzsche and Viereck in America ' 19 has taken the last bit of wind 
out of his sails. 
The paper can now really serve to encourage and cheer up our 
people in Germany, something a number of them, or at least their so-
called leaders, are much in need of. I've received a few more jere­
miads and answered them in accordance with their deserts. Viereck 
was very down in the mouth at the start, but a few days in the fresh 
air of London were enough to restore his resilience. The paper must 
import that fresh air into Germany and by far the best way of doing 
so is to mock our adversaries, treat them with contempt. Once the 
people learn to laugh at Bismarck & Co. again, much will have been 
gained. But it mustn't be forgotten that this is the first time such 
a thing has happened to the people, at any rate the vast majority, or, 
more especially, that a large number of agitators and editors will 
have the discomfort of being jolted out of their very comfortable 
berths. Such being the case, it is just as necessary to cheer people up 
as it is constantly to remind them that Bismarck & Co. are still the 
same jackasses, the same scoundrels and the same poor wretches, im­
potent in face of the historical movement, as they were before the at­
tempted assassinations. ' 20 So any joke at the expense of this rabble is 
of value. 
As regards Ireland, only this much: The people are far too canny 
not to know that an uprising would spell their ruin; it would stand no 
chance save in the case of war between England and America. '2 ' 
Meanwhile the Irish have forced Gladstone to introduce continental 
standing orders in Parliament, '22 thus undermining the whole of the 
English parliamentary system. They have further forced Gladstone to 
forswear all his cant and to become more Tory than even the worst of 
TORIES.  The Coercion Bills 123 have gone through, the Land Bill 124 
will either be thrown out by the Upper House, or else it will be castrat­
ed, and then the fun will begin, in other words, the covert disintegra­
tion of the parties will become overt. Since Gladstone's nomination,

the WHIGS and moderate TORIES, i. e. the big landowners generally, have 
been secretly combining to form a big landed property party. As soon 
as this comes to fruition, and family and personal interests have been 
adjusted, or as soon as the new party is driven out into the open in 
consequence of, say, the Land Bill, the administration and the present 
majority will disintegrate. Then the new bourgeois-radical party will 
come out in opposition to the new conservative party, but with noth­
ing to fall back on save the workers and the Irish peasants. And so 
that there may be no recurrence of bilking and trickery here, a prole­
tarian-radical party is in process of formation under the leadership of 
Joseph Cowen (M. P. for Newcastle), an old Chartist who is  half,  if not 
wholly, communist and a very worthy chap. Ireland is responsible for 
all this, Ireland is the driving force in the realm. This for your private 
information. More on the subject anon.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 30 March 1881 
Dear Bebel, 
Viereck (a postcard from whom I enclose) wants me to give you an 
account of the Boston meeting; but here too, as commonly in com­
bined operations, there has been hitch after hitch; 1. Harney wrote 
a week later; 2. he forgot to enclose the newspaper report which I did 
not get till yesterday. Today I gave this to Kautsky, who is over here, 
for him to work on for the Sozialdemokrat. 126 
The meeting in Boston was first-rate; ill-advertised but nevertheless 
attended by 1,500 people, '/s German. The first speaker was Swin-
ton, an American communist who came to visit us here last sum­
mer43 and is the proprietor of a big New York paper.8 Then Fritz-
sche.  Finally, Wendell Phillips, the great anti-slavery man who, with 
the exception of John Brown, did more than anyone else for the aboli­
tion of slavery and the prosecution of the war, and is the foremost 
speaker in America — maybe in the world. He returned thanks to the 
Germans and gave them credit for the fact that in 1861, in every large 
city, it was the German gymnasts who shielded him with their own 
bodies from the American mob, and who kept St Louis in the 
Union. 127 To give you just one example of how he spoke: 
a The  Sun

'Being as far as I am away from the field of battle, I would not presume to criticise 
the method of combat. I look at Russia, 4,000 miles away, and see what a nightmare 
weighs on the shoulders of the people there. I only hope that someone will be found to 
relieve them of  it. And if the dagger alone can do it, I say: Welcome to the dagger! Is 
there any American here who would disapprove? If he would, then he should look 
(pointing to a picture on the wall) at Joe Warren who died at Bunkers Hill.'" 
That was on the 7th of March. On the 13th a bomb did what the 
dagger had been unable to do. 128 
According to today's Standard, Most is to be prosecuted by the Brit­
ish government because of the article on the assassination at­
tempt! 129 If the Russian Embassy and Gladstone are absolutely in­
tent on making a great man out of the silly nincompoop, no one can 
stop them. At the same time, it's far from certain that Most will be 
found guilty. The moral indignation about the bomb in the big news­
papers was largely a matter of observing the proprieties, something 
your bourgeois here never omits to do, if only for appearances' sake. 
The humorous papers, which reflect public opinion far more faith­
fully, have taken an altogether different view of the case and, by the 
time the trial draws to a close, much may have changed in this re­
spect, so that it's far from certain whether the 12 jurymen will reach 
the unanimous verdict that is called for. 
To return to our American friends, Wendell Phillips' champion­
ship (induced by a young American journalist, Willard Brown, who 
was over here last year, when he consorted much with Marx and gen­
erally did his utmost for them with the American press and gave them 
the boosting they needed) is of the first importance. Their success has 
altogether exceeded my expectations and shows that Bismarckery has 
fallen greatly in the esteem of the Germans, even middle-class 
Germans, in America. However \_^ 'sh hopes of a second trip with 
Liebknecht would hardly seem practicable; it is inadvisable to 
turn up twice in rapid succession. Moreover, such a trip — anyhow 
inadmissible before next year — ought to have been rendered unnec­
essary by the great event in Petersburg and its inevitable conse­
quences. Alexander III, whether he wants to or not, will have to take 
some decisive step to get things moving, but before that there might 
be a short period of intensive persecution, and Switzerland will no 
doubt soon embark on mass expulsions. Meanwhile old William, c if 
not actually on his last legs, becomes dottier and dottier, Bismarck

grows daily more rabid and seems absolutely intent on playing the 
part of a rampaging Prussian Roland, the bourgeois parties go fur­
ther off the rails every day, while the government's taxation mania 
sees to the rest. Even if we all sat with our hands in our laps, events 
would forcibly propel us to the fore and pave the way for victory. It is 
a real pleasure to see a revolutionary world situation we have long 
predicted mature into a general crisis, blinkered opponents do our 
work for us, and the inexorability of a development that is heading 
for universal collapse prevail in, and as a result of, the general 
confusion.

IN GENEVA 
London, 4 April 1881 
Dear Old Man, 
I am writing to you just before the post goes, having only this mo­
ment got the money order, four pounds sterling = 100 frs 80 cts, 
which I trust will be paid over to you without delay. Your address 
was indispensable,a  as the post office here insists on it, otherwise no 
money order. I shall press Liebknecht about his false promises b; those 
fellows must do something for you. I'm glad, by the way, that our 
people have plucked up courage again; for a time most of them were 
suffering from a bad attack of  cold  feet; the paper, ' too, is giving 
a good account of  itself.  That philistine Most is definitely in luck; his 
Freiheit  was on its last legs, whereupon the British government felt im­
pelled to give it a helping hand, and did so in the most brilliant man­
ner. ' 29 Such colossal stupidity passes all  belief,  but it so happens that 
we have the liberals at the helm and they are capable of any stupid­
ity, any dirty trick. They went ahead in such a hurry that so far they 
don't even know under which Act they will charge Most! But Bis­
marck needed this coup for his socialist debate in the Reichstag 132 
and, since Gladstone, our premier, is an enthusiastic admirer of the 
bumped-off Alexander,d there was no difficulty about the thing. It 
will be all the more difficult for them to draw up an indictment, let 
alone produce a jury that will find Most guilty. So Most will become 
famous on the cheap, even if only for a brief spell, while Bismarck, 
even though he, too, may be gently rubbing his hands just now, will 
ultimately find himself discredited yet again. 
Kindest regards from Marx and your

MARX TO JENNY LONGUET 133 
IN ARGENTFX'IL 
[London,] 11 April 1881 
My dear Jennychen, 
It's been boring ever since you left — without you and Johnny and 
Harra! and MR 'TEA!' a Sometimes I hurry across to the window when 
I hear children's voices which sound like those of our children, mo­
mentarily oblivious of the fact that the little chaps are on the other 
side of the Channel! 
One comfort is that you have found a nice place to live and that it 
suits the children; otherwise everything seems to be RATHER  WORSE  than 
in London, with the exception, however, of the climate, whose benefi­
cial effect — beneficial also to asthma — you will discover  BY AND  BY. 
I have found yet another doctor for Mama, one recommended to 
me by  Prof.  Lankester, namely Dr Donkin;  HE SEEMS  A BRIGHT  AND  INTELLI­
GENT  MAN;  but for Mama's complaint it does indeed strike me that ONE 
MAN [is] AS GOOD, AND PERHAPS BETTER, THAN ANOTHER MAN.  However,  the 
CHANGE  OF MEDICAL  ADVISERS  serves to distract her and, during the initial 
period — which doesn't usually last long — she is full of praise for the 
new Aesculapius. Longuet's eyeglass turned up immediately after his 
departure; it was, in fact, tucked away in your bedroom. Hirsch has 
been selected to bring it to you, but that gossip-hunter seems hardly 
able to tear himself away from London at a moment when there is so 
much to be smelt out. The 'great' Most affair 129 alone is an inex­
haustible source of fresh water (if by no means a 'cooling stream') for 
the said hart.b  Now he threatens to postpone his departure till 18 Ap­
ril. Then, too, he has found a kindred spirit in Kautsky — on whom 
he had frowned so grimly; even Engels takes a much more tolerant 
view of this joker c since the latter gave proof of his considerable 
drinking ability. When the charmer— the little joker,c I mean — first 
came to see me, the first question that rose to my lips was — are you 
a Marx' grandsons: Jean, Henri and Edgar Longuet -b A pun on the name Hirsch — 
hart. ('As pants the hart for cooling streams/When heated in the chase'.)- 0 Kauti 
(diminutive Käutzchen), an untranslatable pun on the name Kautsky.

like your mothera? Not in the least, he exclaimed, and silently I con­
gratulated his mother. He's a mediocrity, narrow in outlook, over-
wise (only 26 years old), a know-all, hard-working after a fashion, 
much concerned with statistics out of which, however, he makes little 
sense, by nature a member of the philistine tribe, for the rest, a decent 
fellow in his own way; I unload him onto amigoh  Engels as much as 
I can. 
The day before yesterday the Dogberry  CLUB  '3 * was here; yester­
day, besides the 2 Maitland girlsc  — and, briefly, Lankester and 
Dr Donkin — we were invaded by Hyndman and his wife, d both of 
whom have too much staying-power. I quite like the wife on account 
of her brusque, unconventional and determined manner of thinking 
and speaking, but it's amusing to see how admiringly she hangs on 
the lips of her complacent chatterbox of a husband! Mama grew so 
weary (it was close on half past ten at night) that she withdrew. But 
there was some BYPLAY which tickled her. For Tussy has discovered 
a new infant prodigy amongst the Dogberries — one Radford; this 
youth is already a BARRISTER-AT-LAW, yet looks down upon the jus ' and 
works in the same LINE as Waldhorn. HE LOOKS  WELL,  CROSS  between Irving 
and the late Lassalle (but has nothing in common with the latter's 
cynical, smarmily importunate mannerisms à la marquis-cum-Jew), 
AN INTELLIGENT  AND  SOMEWHAT  PROMISING  BOY.  WELL, that's him in a nutshell. 
So shockingly did Dolly Maitland pay court to him that during sup­
per Mama and Tussy were constantly exchanging signals. Finally, 
Mr Maitland also turned up, pretty well sober, and began a verbal 
duel with his instructive neighbour, Hyndman, on the subject of 
Gladstone in whom Maitland, a spiritualist, believes. *I — rather an­
noyed by a bad throat — felt glad when the whole lot vanished. It is 
a strange thing that one cannot well live altogether without com­
pany, and that when you get it, you try hard to rid yourself of it.* 
Hartmann is working hard in Woolwich as a  COMMON  WORKMAN;  it is 
becoming increasingly difficult to converse with him in any language. 
The Russian  REFUGEES  in Geneva insist that he should disavow Roche-
fort and do so publicly. This he neither will nor can, even had this not 
been made impossible by the immoderate letter sent to Rochefort by 
the Petersburg Committee and published by him in the Intransi­
geant. 135 The Genevans have, indeed, long been trying to convince

Europe that it was, in fact, they who were directing the movement in 
Russia; now that the lie they themselves had disseminated has been 
taken up by Bismarck et cie and constitutes a threat to them, they as­
sert the opposite and vainly endeavour to convince the world of their 
innocence. In fact, they are mere doctrinaires, muddle-headed anar-
cho-socialists, and their influence on the Russian 'theatre of war' is 
ZERO. 
Have you been following the course of the legal proceedings 
against the assassins in St Petersburg?136  They are sterling chaps 
through and through,  sans pose  mélodramatique, a simple, matter-of-fact, 
heroic. Shouting and doing are irreconcilable opposites. The 
Petersburg Executive Committee, 70 which took such vigorous ac­
tion, issues manifestoes of exquisite 'moderation'. It is remote indeed 
from the bungling way in which Most and other puerile ranters advo­
cate  TYRANNICIDE  as a 'theory' and 'PANACEA' (the same thing was done by 
ENGLISHMEN  as innocent as Disraeli, Savage Landor, Macaulay and 
Mazzini's friend, Stansfeld); they, on the other hand, are at pains to 
teach Europe that their modus operandi* is a specifically Russian 
and historically inevitable mode of action which no more lends 
itself to moralising — for or against — than does the earthquake in 
Chios.137 
In this connection there was a fine old scandal in the House of 
Commons (as you know, so as to oblige Bismarck and Gorchakov 
these miserable Gladstonites are making an onslaught, in the person 
of the pitiful Most, 129  on the freedom of the press in England, in 
which they are unlikely to succeed). Lord Churchill, a bumptious 
Tory youth, and member of the Marlborough FAMILY, questioned Sir 
Charles Dilke and Brassey, both UNDERSTRAPPERS in the CABINET, about 
the financial support afforded to the Freiheit. This was flatly denied 
and Churchill was compelled to name his authority. He named the 
ubiquitous Mr Maltman Barry! I enclose a cutting about this affair 
from the Weekly Dispatch (the Dilkes' paper, edited by the -PHILOSOPHI­
CAL RADICAL, Ashton Dilke, brother of the great 'Dilke'), and a state­
ment by Maltman Barry in The Daily News. Clearly Dilke is lying. 
How pitiful that this braggart, the self-appointed future 'President of 
the English republic' should, for fear of losing his post, allow Bis­
marck to dictate upon what journals he ought or ought not to bestow 
-£ 1! Only suppose it became known that, immediately after Hart-

mann's arrival  in London, Ashton Dilke invited  him to a  LUNCHEON! 
But Hartmann turned this down,  not  wanting  to 'exhibit' him­
self. 
Apropos  the  Comtist renegade Maxse. This laddie  is done  far too 
great  an honour  in La  Justice which handles  him  with  kid  gloves.  In 
the eyes  of this peculiar clique  — ENGLISH LIBERALS  and  their even worse 
subspecies, the so  CALLED  RADICALS  — it is indeed a crime on the part of 
La Justice that, flouting  all  tradition  and  contrary  to agreement,  it 
fails to treat these  SHAMS  AND  HUMBUGS  in the  accepted manner,  to perpe­
tuate  the  legend that  is current about them  in the liberal press  on the 
Continent!  If one  considers  the  enormous effrontery with which  the 
London press attacks socialist parties  in all  European countries,  and 
how difficult  it is for  anyone  who  thinks  it worth  the  trouble  to say 
a word  in return  or even  to get a  brief answer into that press  — it is 
really  a bit too  much  to have  to recognise  the  principle that, should 
a Paris newspaper venture  to criticise that arch-hypocrite  and  CASUIST 
of the  old-fashioned school,  the  'great' Gladstone,  it is  duty-bound 
to put  entire columns  at the  disposal  of Mr  Maxse  and his  prose,  in 
order that  he might repay Gladstone  IN KIND  for the  avancement* pro­
vided  by the  latter! 
Assuming  the  policy adopted  by Gladstone  (man of  the COERCION  '23 
and ARMS ACT  '38) vis-à-vis Ireland  to be as  right  as it is in  fact wrong, 
would this constitute  any  reason  to talk of that man's 'générosité  and 
'magnanimité'?  As  though there  was any  question of any such things  be­
tween England  and  Ireland! Maxse really ought  to be  told that, while 
such Pecksniffian expressions  may  have free currency  in London, they 
do not  have  it in  Paris! 
Get Longuet  to read Parnell's speech  in Cork  in today's Times. b 
He will find  in it the  substance  of what ought  to be  said about Gladstone's 
new LAND  ACT12*;  in  this connection  it should  not be  forgotten that 
Gladstone,  by his  disgraceful preliminary measures (incl. abolishing 
the freedom  of  speech  of members  of the  Lower House),122  has 
brought about  the  conditions under which mass  EVICTIONS  are now  taking 
place  in Ireland,  while  the  ACT  is pure humbug, seeing that  the  LORDS 
who can  get  anything they want from Gladstone,  and no  longer have 
to tremble before  the  Land League I39—will  DOUBTLESS  throw  it out 
or else  so castrate  it that  the  Irish themselves will  end up by  voting 
against  it.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 140 
IN ZURICH 
London, 14 April 1881 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Very many thanks for the excerpt — for numerous reasons, how­
ever, it is desirable that we should read the full text of the relevant 
speeches. Kautsky will already have asked you to let us have the 
shorthand report '4 ' for a day or two. So much has been said in the 
Reichstag and Landtags that would have been better left unsaid 
that we cannot express an opinion on such matters unless we are 
fully acquainted with the case. 
Your announcement that you wished to resign from the paper0 
came as a most unpleasant surprise. We can see absolutely no reason 
for it and it would give us  great pleasure  if you were to reconsider your 
decision. You have edited the paper ably from the outset, have given 
it the right tone, at the same time developing the humorous side it 
needed. Erudition in a newspaper editor is far less important than the 
ability speedily to interpret things from the aspect that matters, and 
a Marx's jocular nickname.-b Written in large block letters at the beginning of the let­
ter-0  Der Sozialdemokrat

this you have nearly always done. Kautsky, for example, would never 
be able to do that; he always has too many secondary viewpoints, 
which is perfectly all right for longish articles in a  revue,  but in the 
case of a paper, where rapid decisions are called for, frequently makes 
it impossible to see the wood for the trees, and that mustn't happen in 
a party organ. Alongside you, Kautsky would be quite all right, but 
on his own he would, I'm afraid, be all too often prevented by qualms 
of conscience over theory from following up a crucial advantage as 
unswervingly as is required by the Sozialdemokrat. I don't see who 
could take your place at this juncture, so long as Liebknecht remains 
in jail 142 and doesn't go to Zurich, which would be senseless except in 
an emergency, since there's much more need of him in the Reichstag. 
So you'll have to stay on after all whether you like it or not. 
If we have not yet come forward directly and by name in the So­
zialdemokrat, the fault, I do assure you, does not lie with your editor­
ship of this paper up till now. On the contrary. It lies with the very 
statements made in Germany I alluded to at the beginning. Admit­
tedly, we have been promised that this won't recur and that the revo­
lutionary nature of the party is to be plainly spelled out and adhered 
to. But we should like to see evidence of it first, nor do we have any 
great confidence (rather the reverse) in the revolutionary bent of cer­
tain of these gentlemen, and that is precisely why it is most desirable 
that we should have the stenographic reports of the speeches made by 
all our deputies. After you have used them you can easily send them 
over here for a day or two; I guarantee their prompt return. That will 
help to clear away the last obstacles that still exist — through no fault 
of our own — between ourselves and the party in Germany. This in 
confidence. 
It would seem that Gladstone has paved the way for the triumph 
of Most. It's hardly likely that  12 jurors will be found who will unani­
mously find Most guilty, and, if only one finds him innocent, the case 
will fall to the ground. Admittedly, he can be brought before another 
jury, but this hardly ever happens. On top ofthat, however, the 1861 
Act, 143 under which Most is being charged, has never been applied 
before and by and large it is the opinion of jurists that the wording is 
inapplicable to the case. 
Argyll's resignation from the Ministry because the Irish LAND 
BILL '24 confers on tenants a measure of co-ownership of the land is an 
ill omen for the fate of the BILL in the Upper House. Meanwhile Parnell 
has made a successful start in Manchester to his English agitational

tour. The position of the grand liberal coalition is becoming ever 
more critical. But then over here everything moves slowly, if the more 
surely for that. 
So don't be deterred by the initial difficulties; don't lose heart but 
carry on editing just as before. If the worst comes to the worst, you 
could write to Leipzig and ask them to send you an assistant. That 
would probably be the best way of overcoming the difficulties you 
have to contend with. Then, when you have taught the new man the 
ropes,  there will still be time enough to talk of resigning. 
Kindest regards.

tulate you on both your speeches. The one on the Accident Bill 
pleased us particularly. It strikes the right note — high-minded, yet 
based on a real knowledge of the facts, and ironically superior. Your 
criticism of the Bill was all that could have been said or desired. I have 
been expressly asked to tell you all this on Marx's behalf as well as my 
own. It was the best speech of yours we have ever read, and the de­
bate gave one the impression that the turner, Bebel, was the only 
educated man in the whole of the Reichstag. 
At the 2nd reading you might possibly include the following: You 
might perhaps ask us, gentlemen, how we can prevail upon our con­
sciences to grant  money  to this government, even though it be for the 
relief of workers who have met with an accident? Gentlemen, after 
what the Prussian Landtag and you yourselves have done in the mat­
ter of subventions, the power of the Reichstag in financial affairs, its 
ability to wring concessions from the government by virtue of the fact 
that it holds the purse-strings, has gone by the board. The Reichstag 
and Landtag have thrown away their entire budgetary authority 
with nothing to show for it in return, and here it is certainly no longer 
a case of a paltry million or two.— All those subventions, moreover, 
were for purposes of exploitation (protective tariffs, purchase of the 
railways at 30% above their value — Rhenish Rail were standing at 
less than 120, rose to 150 as a result of the government's offer to pur­
chase, now 160!), and this time it is, after all, at least  supposed  to be for 
the workers. 
For the rest, the terms of acceptance you proposed fully protect you 
to your rear. 
But what a typically inflated, maliciously stupid, Prussian Junker-
cum-bureaucrat Brother von Puttkamer is! 145

MARX TO JENNY LONGUET 146 
IN ARGENTEUIL 
[London,] 29 April 1881 
41 Maitland Park, N. W. 
My dear Jenny, 
I congratulate you upon the happy delivery; at least I presume 
that everything is right from your taking the trouble to write. My 
'womankind' expected the 'newcomer' to increase 'the better half of 
the population; for my own part I prefer the 'manly' sex for children 
born at this turning point of history. They have before them the most 
revolutionary period men had ever to pass through. The bad thing 
now is to be 'old' so as to be only able to foresee instead of seeing. 
The 'newcomer'a steps in pretty closely to your own birthday, 
Johnny's, and mine. He, like ourselves, patronizes the merry month 
of May. I am of course charged by Mama (and Tussy, though she 
finds perhaps yet the time to write herself) to wish you all possible 
good things, but I do not see that 'wishes' are good for anything ex­
cept the glossing over one's own powerlessness. 
I hope by and by you will find the servants you want and get your 
^ménage' b into some quiet routine. I felt rather anxious about the too 
many troubles weighing upon you just now, at such a critical mo­
ment. 
Johnny, according to your last letter, is recovering his health. He is 
in fact the most delicate of the three boysc whom I have the honour to 
know personally. Tell him that while walking yesterday through the 
park — our own Maitland Park — that glorious person, the park-
keeper, suddenly approached, asked for news about Johnny, and at 
last communicated me the important fact that he will 'retire' from his 
office and make place to a younger 'force'. With him one of the pillars 
of the 'Lord Southampton' disappears. 147 
There is little going on in 'our circle' as Beesly daubed it. Pumps 
still awaits 'news' from Beust; has in the meanwhile thrown an eye

upon 'Kautsky'  who,  however,  did not yet  'declare';  and she  will al­
ways feel grateful  to Hirsch  for having  not  only virtually 'declared', 
but, after  a refusal, renewed  his 'declaration', just before  his trip to 
Paris.  This Hirsch becomes more  and  more  a nuisance.  My  'opinion' 
of him  grows less  and  less. 
The last London craze  was the  Disraeli exaltation which gave John 
Bull the  satisfaction  of admiring  his own  magnanimity.  Is it not 
'grand'  to act the  sycophant with regard  to a  dead  man  whom just 
before  his kicking  the bucket  you had  saluted with rotten apples  and 
foul eggs?  At the  same time this teaches  the 'lower classes' that how­
ever their 'natural superiors'  may  fall out amongst each other during 
the struggle  for 'place  and pelf,  death brings  out the  truth that  the 
leaders  of the  'ruling classes'  are  always 'great  and  good  men'. 
It is a  very fine trick  of Gladstone  — only  the  'stupid party' does 
not understand  it — to  offer  at a  moment when landed property  in 
Ireland  (as in  England) will  be depreciated  by the  import of corn  and 
cattle from  the  United States  — to  offer them  at that very moment 
the public Exchequer where they  can  sell that property  at a  price  it 
does no longer possess!  148 
The real intricacies  of the  Irish land problem  — which indeed  are 
not especially Irish  — are so  great that  the  only true  way to  solve  it 
would  be to  give  the Irish Home-rule  and  thus force them  to solve  it 
themselves.  But  John Bull  is too  stupid  to understand this. 
Engels comes just, sends  you his  best compliments,  and as it is al­
most post-time,  so that  I cannot afterwards finish this letter,  I must 
abruptly  end it. 
With  my  compliments  to Johnny, Harry  and the  'good'  Wolf3 
(who  is indeed  an excellent  boy) and  also  to father Longuet. 
Yours, 
Old Nick

122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
My dear Jenny, 
Many thanks for your kind letter, it is really too good of you to sit 
down and write to us in the midst of the trouble you have to pass 
through. But let me at once pass to the main thing. I have every rea­
son to hope that unless unforeseen accidents occur, you still will soon 
have your Mama" with you. Mohr told me on Sunday that the doc­
tor b thinks she is getting strong enough for the journey. There are 
great changes in her state from time to time, sometimes she goes 
about in the day and even to theatres in the evening, but at other 
times she suffers from very bad pains and scarcely leaves her bed for 
a couple of days. But these attacks seem to pass off as they come and 
not to leave her visibly worse. Still she is upon the whole losing flesh 
and this seems to be the only constant symptom which if not arrested 
may turn out serious. What the nature of the complaint is I am to­
tally ignorant of and am apt to conclude that the doctors are equally 
in the dark, anyhow they don't seem to agree at all about it. When 
Tussy wrote to you, your Mama was just suffering from one of these 
attacks, and I believe there was a slight misunderstanding about 
what the doctor said, namely that she was  then  temporarily not in a fit 
state to travel. The doctor himself wishes her very much to go, as he 
anticipates a good effect from the change. 
Now about Mohr's Turkish baths, they need not frighten you, he is 
taking them merely for the sake of his rheumatically stiff leg which 
bothers him in walking. As to his cold, the present warm weather will 
soon reduce it to an infinitesimal quantity and a change to the seaside 
will finish it  off—  that is my opinion. I have just taken him up to 
Hampstead Heath, I hope the walk will do him good. Your Mama 
was out, so she cannot be so very bad just now. 
I am glad that amidst all the  petites misères  de la vie de  campagne c you 
still are well pleased with house, garden and climate which after all

are the main thing, to the rest you will either gradually find remedies 
or — get used to them. My especial envy is directed of course to the 
wine cellar and the cellars generally for which we may sigh in vain 
here in London. 
You must indeed have risen tremendously in the eyes of old Collett 
since you and Longuet have got Clemenceau round to the only 'cor­
rect' view about Tunis. 149 I can very well imagine the old man's en­
thusiasm at seeing the truly orthodox policy preached in a large Paris 
daily. Fancy the old buffer, who all his life has defended the power of 
the Crown, now talking of a saviour of the Republic. 
We are going on here much in the usual way, excepting that we 
have Mrs Pauli here who brings her eldest step-daughter to Manches­
ter where she is going to stay some time with an old friend of Pauli's. 
She is not quite so stout as she was but quite as lively. Last Sunday by 
a godsend we got some Waldmeister, a and with the help of a dozen of 
Moselle we brewed three bowls of Maitrank b which were duly emp­
tied by a — rather numerous — company. There were fourteen of us, 
and they were very jolly. Lenchen was there also and told me this 
morning it had not very well agreed with her: 'she never had such 
a Katzenjammer" in her life' (please don't let it out!). Mrs Pauli is very 
sorry she cannot see you here this time and wishes to be most kindly 
remembered to you. 
Hartmann called yesterday with the news that he is off to America, 
it is a good thing for him, he could never settle down here properly 
until he got work for a short time in Siemens' electric factory in Wool­
wich but that is at an end now too. He talks of coming back in a few 
months. 
Pumps is going on as usual, suffers now and then from headaches, 
my only complaint is an increasing left-ear deafness, I hope the sum­
mer may cure it. 
Kind regards to you and Longuet. Pumps sends her love and I join 
her in it. 
Yours affectionately,

Dear Mr Swinton, 
I need hardly recommend you the bearer of these lines, my excel­

mine; it is rather bad, but the only one left to me. 
As to the book of Mr Henry George,a  I consider it as a last at­
tempt— to save the capitalistic regime. Of course, this is not the 
meaning of the author, but the older disciples of Ricardo — the radi­
cal ones — fancied already that by the public appropriation of the 
rent of land everything would be righted. I have referred to this 
doctrine in the Misere de la Philosophie (published in 1847 against 
Proudhon). b 
Mrs Marx sends you her best compliments. Unfortunately her ill­
ness assumes more and more a fatal character. 
Believe me, dear Sir, 
Yours most sincerely, 
Karl Marx

My dearest Don Quixote, 
I am really wrong to have not written before this, but you know my 
good intentions and weak doings in this line. There passes, however, 
no day, when my thoughts are not with you and the lovely children.a 
As to my health you need not trouble you[rself]; I had a nasty 
cold, almost as sempiternal as was the Stockschnupfen b of Seguin se­
lig c — but it is now rapidly passing away. 
As to Möhmchen, you are aware that there is no cure of the illness 
she suffers from, and she gets indeed weaker. Fortunately the pains 
are not such as they mostly are in such cases, the best proof of which is 
that she attends still several times during the week at London thea­
tres. She keeps in fact wonderfully up, but travelling to Paris is quite 
out of the question. I consider it a most happy event that Lina Schoe-
ler surprised us yesterday and is to stay about a month. 
Has Johnny got Reineke or rather Renard the Fox d I sent him? and 
has the poor fellow somebody to read it for him? 
To-day (Bank Holiday) '5 ' and yesterday infernal rainy and cold 
weather, one of the bad tricks the celestial father has always in store 
for his London plebeian cattle and sheep. Yesterday he spoiled by 
the rain the Hyde Park Demonstration of Parnell's. 152 
Hartmann has on Friday last left for New York and I am glad that 
he is out of harm's way. But foolishly, a few days before his departure, 
he asked the hand of  Pumps  from  Engels  — and this by writing, telling 
him at the same time that he believed he committed no mistake in do­
ing so, alias, he (Hartmann) believed in his (Hartmann's) accept­
ance on the part of Pumps — the which girl had indeed rather 
hardly flirted with him, but only to stir Kautsky. I learn now from 
Tussy that the same Hartmann had offered himself to her before her 
voyage to Jersey. But the present case is the worse as the distinguished

Perovskaya, the victim of the Russian movement, had lived with 
Hartmann in 'free' marriage. And she has hardly died on the gal­
lows.  153 From Perovskaya to Pumps — rather too bad this, and 
Mama is quite disgusted with it and the whole male sex! 
Longuet's article on Ireland was good. We all thought there had 
something happened seeing that for some time he seemed 
more and more to disappear from the columns of the Justice. 
Have you seen or heard anything of the illustrious Hirsch? He sent 
me today two New York papers. 
There is only one news worth reporting. A Yankeea is said to have 
invented a coal-cutting machine which would do away with the great­
est part of the present labour of the colliers —  viz. the 'hewing' of 
coal in the coal-measures and mines, leaving to the miners only the 
task of breaking the cut of coal and loading it into trucks. If this 
invention prove successful — as there is every reason to believe — it 
will give an immense stir in Yankeeland and do great damage to John 
Bull's industrial supremacy. 
Mama also asks me to tell you that the pretext for Lina's [Schoe-
ler] presence is the wedding of Lisa Green, daughter of theb success­
ful admirer of Martin Tupper. 
Laura does everything to amuse and cheer Möhmchen. 
Helen0 sends you her love. 
And now kiss many many times for me Johnny, Harra and the 
noble Wolfd. As to the 'great unknown' one/ I dare not make so free 
with him. 
How is your asthma? Does it still cling to you? I hardly understand 
how you manage to get breathing time with 4 children and only 
nominal servants. 
Farewell, my dear child,

ENGELS TO JENNY LONGUET

London, 17 June 1881 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
My dear Jenny, 
I hasten to reply to your letter of the 15th received this morning 
only. When I wrote to you last,a the doctorb  insisted  upon your Mama 
going to Paris and it was herself who resisted, saying she did not feel 
strong enough for the journey. A few days later the doctor found that 
she had indeed become so much weaker that he could no longer ad­
vise her to go to Paris. She is indeed getting extremely thin and ema­
ciated and complained to me today a great deal about increasing 
weakness, especially when dressing, she has begun to stay the greater 
part of the day in bed and the doctor made her get up and go out for 
a walk while I was there. He has now told Mohr that the best thing to 
do is for  both  of them  to go to Eastbourne, and that at once. We tried to 
persuade her, but of course she offered all kinds of resistance: now she 
ought to go to Paris if anywhere, and so forth, so we told her that 
a fortnight's stay at Eastbourne would perhaps restore her forces suffi­
ciently to enable her to go to Paris afterwards, etc., etc. I left them at 
it, and you will probably hear the result in a day or two from Tussy 
who said she would write to you soon. 
Whatever the nature of the complaint may be, this constant and 
increasing loss of flesh and strength seems a very serious feature, espe­
cially as it does not seem to come to a stop — most of the doctors said 
that this was not in itself a dangerous symptom unless it went beyond 
a certain point; that they had known cases where the weakening all of 
a sudden had been arrested and strength recovered. I hope the sea­
side will have that effect, if we only had her there already. 
To Mohr the change will be equally favourable, he wants a bit of 
bracing up too, his cough is not so bad at nights and he sleeps better, 
that is one thing.

a good deal, I hope she will stay for some time. 
Sam Moore has passed his final examination as Barrister success­

I hear from Tussy that you have got a fresh servant and that she 
seems to suit you, so your household troubles bid fair to diminish too.

Dear Sorge, 
Today I had broken off some other work I was doing, meaning to 
embark at long last on a lengthy letter to you and now, as ill luck 
would have it, I've had one visitor after another and thus hardly have 
time enough left to drop you a few lines before the post goes. Hence

Your sona pleases everyone he meets here. Since I have been suffer­

sation ABOUT ONCE  A WEEK and I find that he has,  au fond, a absorbed 
rather more of our views than would appear. He is an altogether ca­
pable, decent lad with, moreover, cultivated manners and a pleasant 
temperament. He is, besides, and that is all-important,  FULL  OF ENERGY. 
My last visitors, only just gone, were Viereck and his newly mar­
ried wife, also née Viereck. b I had not seen the gentleman since he 
came back from America. ' ' 9 A few days ago he sent Kautsky to see 
me with sundry scraps of paper for me to sign (one written by Lieb­
knecht and also signed by him in his own and Bebel's names). All of 
them related to certain agreements respecting the Lingenau legacy 45 
negotiated by Viereck with the 'New Torker Volkszeitung' et cie. I refused 
to sign since, in this matter, I am obliged, as I explained, to deal 
only with our chief executor, Sorge. At the same time I gave Viereck 
to understand that, in my view, the first thing to be done was to pay 
you the 120 dollars for the lawyer in St Louis out of what still remai­
ned of the American fund in New York. Viereck now tells me today 
that — upon my accepting responsibility vis-à-vis the Leipzigers — he 
at once sent off instructions to that effect to New York. He arrived INTHE 
NICK  OF TIME, for otherwise a formal  protest  would have gone off from 
me to Leipzig tomorrow, a protest against the modus operandi' of the 
Leipzig party leaders who had hitherto conducted themselves in this 
matter as if the decision rested solely with them. 
Now, postfestum,d  Viereck has mentioned your claim in respect of 
an advance of 80 dollars. I told him that, after the court decision, 
should this be unfavourable, we, the executors, would indemnify you, 
as we damned well ought. 
Before getting your copy of Henry George, ' I had already had 
2 others, one from Swinton and one from Willard Brown. I therefore 
gave one to Engels and one to Lafargue. Today I shall have to con­
fine myself to a very brief assessment of the book. Theoretically, the 
man is totally  arrière.  ' He has understood nothing of the nature of  sur­
plus value and hence, after the English pattern, but lagging far be­
hind the English, he loses himself in speculations about those portions 
of surplus value that have become independent — about the relations 
between profit, rent, interest, etc. His basic tenet is that  everything 
would be in  order  were rent to be paid to the State. (You will also find 
payment of this kind among the transitional measures in the Commu-

nist Manifesto. a) This view owes its origin to the bourgeois economists; 
it was first advanced (if we disregard a similar postulate in the late 
18th century) by the earliest  radical  disciples of Ricardo immediately 
after the latter's death. In 1847, in my anti-Proudhon book, I com­
mented on it thus: 'Nous  concevons  que des  économistes,  tels que Mill' (se­
nior, not his son John Stuart who repeats the same thing in somewhat 
modified form), 'Cherbuliez, Hilditch et autres, ont demandé que la 
rente soit attribuée à l'Etat pour servir à l'acquittement des impôts.  C'est  la 
franche  expression  de la haine que le capitaliste industriel voue au prop­
riétaire foncier, qui lui parait une inutilité, une superfétation, dans l'en­
semble de la  production  bourgeoise.'' b 
As already mentioned, we ourselves adopted the appropriation of 
rent by the State amongst many other  transitional measures  which, as is 
likewise indicated in the Manifesto, are and cannot but be contra­
dictory in themselves. 
But making a socialist  PANACEA  of this desideratum of the English 
radical bourgeois economists, declaring this procedure to be a solu­
tion of the antagonisms inherent in today's mode of production — this 
was the prerogative oï Colins,  a native of Belgium and on old, retired 
officer of Napoleon's Hussars who, in the latter days of Guizot and 
the early ones of  Napoleon  le petit, I55 sent out into the world from 
Paris bulky volumes on the subject of this, his 'discovery',' likewise 
making the further discovery that, while there is indeed no God, there 
is an 'immortal' human soul, and that animals have 'no sensitivity'. 
For had they any sensitivity, i. e. soul, we would be cannibals and 
a kingdom of righteousness could never be set up on this earth. His 
'anti-landed property theory', along with his soul, etc., theory, has for 
years been advocated month after month in the Paris journal Philo­
sophie de l'Avenir by his few remaining disciples, mostly Belgians. 
They call themselves 'collectivistes rationnels' and have applauded 
Henry George. 
In the same vein as them, and at much the same time, one Samter, 
amongst others, a shallow-pated Prussian banker and lottery collec-
a See present edition, Vol. 6, p.  505.-b  'We understand such economists as Mill, Cher-
buliez, Hilditch and others demanding that rent should be handed over to the State to 
serve in place of taxes. That is the frank expression of the hatred the  industrial capitalist 
bears towards the  landed  proprietor,  who seems to him a useless thing, an excrescence 
upon the general body of bourgeois production.' See K. Marx, The  Poverty  of Philosophy,

tor from East Prussia, distended this 'socialism'  to fill a hefty tome.a 
All these 'socialists' since Colins have this  in common  — they allow 
wage labour  and  hence also capitalist  production  to subsist, while  en­
deavouring  to delude themselves  and the  world into believing that 
the transformation  of rent into taxation paid  to the  State must bring 
about  the  automatic disappearance  of all  the abuses  of capitalist pro­
duction.  So the  whole thing  is merely  an attempt, tricked  out with  so­
cialism,  to save the capitalist régime  and,  indeed,  to re-establish  it on an even 
broader  basis than  at present. 
Again, this cloven  hoof,  which  is at the  same time  an ass's  hoof, is 
unmistakably  in evidence  in the  declamations  of Henry George.  It is 
all the more inexcusable  in his  case  in that  he ought,  on the  contrary, 
to have asked himself the question:  How  comes  it that  in the  UNITED 
STATES, where  the land  was  relatively —  i. e. by  comparison with civil­
ised Europe — accessible  to the  great mass of the people  and  TO A CER­
TAIN  DEGREE  (again relative) still is,  the capitalist economy  and the  cor­
responding enslavement  of the working class have developed more  ra­
pidly  and  brazenly than  in any  other country? 
On the  other hand, George's book, like  the  sensation  it created  in 
your midst,  is significant  in being  a first,  if unsuccessful, attempt  at 
emancipation from orthodox political economy. 
H. George,  by the by,  seems  to know nothing  of the  history  of the 
earlier American ANTI-REXTERS '5  6 who  were  men of  practice rather 
than theory.  In other respects  he is a  talented writer (talented,  too, in 
the matter  of boosting  the  YANKEES),  as is  shown  by, e. g., his  article 
on California  in the  Atlantic.  157 He  also  has the  revolting presump-
tiousness  and  arrogance that  is the  unmistakable hallmark  of all such 
PANACEA-mongers. 
Between ourselves,  my  wife's illness  is, alas, incurable.  In a few 
days'  time  I shall  be taking  her to the  SEASIDE  at Eastbourne.

MARX TO HENRY MAYERS HYNDMAN 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] 
Eastbourne, Sussex, 2 July 1881 
43 Terminus Road 
My dear Sir, 
The state of Mrs Marx's health which becomes daily more critical 
and demands my continual attendance upon her, will account for my 
belated reply to your letter d. d. June 5. 
I confess to some astonishment at the discovery that, during your 
stay at London, you should have so closely kept the secret of your 
plan, then matured and executed, to publish, with certain modifica­
tions,  the rejected article of The Nineteenth  Century  as chapters II and 
III ofEngland for All, that is to say of your  comments  on the  Federation's 
Foundation Program. 158 
In your letter which does not at all refer to the surprise thus kept in 
store for me, you say: 
'If you think I ought to acknowledge your book by your name, etc' 
That question, it seems to me, ought to have preceded your publi­
cation instead of coming behind it. 
You favour me with two reasons for freely using the Capital, 
a work not yet Englished, without mentioning the book itself or its 
author. 
One reason is, that 'many (Englishmen) have an horror of Social­
ism and that name'. Was it with a view to assuage this 'horror' that 
you evoked [on] p. 86 'the demon of  Socialism'? 
Your second and last reason is, that 'the Englishmen have a dread 
of being taught by a foreigner'! 
I have not found it so during the times of the 'International', nor of 
Chartism. ,59 But let that pass. If this dread of 'the' Englishmen 
frightened you, why tell them in the preface p. VI that the 'ideas' etc. 
of chapters II and III, whatever else they may be, bear at all events 
the stigma of being no home-make? The Englishmen you have to deal

62. Marx to Hyndman. 2 July 1881 103 
with can hardly be so dense as to fancy that the above-said passage 
points to an — English author. 
Apart, however, from your rather humorous reasons, I am decid­
edly of opinion that to have named the Capital and its author, would 
have been a big blunder. Party programs ought to keep free of any 
apparent dependence upon individual authors or books. But allow 
me to add that they are also no proper place for new scientific de­
velopments, such as those borrowed by you from the Capital, and 
that the latter are altogether out of place in a commentary on a Pro­
gram with whose professed aims they are not at all connected. Their 
introduction might have had some fitness in the Exposé of a Program 
for the foundation of a distinct and independent Working Class 
Party. 
You are good enough to inform me that your brochure 'though 
marked "price half-a crown" is not published', but 'merely' to be 
'distributed to members of the Democratic Federation, etc' I am 
quite sure that this was your intention, but I know that it is not opinion 
of your printer. A friend of mine saw your brochure in my study, 
wanted it, copied its title and place of printing, ordered it through his 
booksellers Williams and Norgate on the 13th of June and got it by 
them with their account note d. d. 14th June. 
And this brings me to the only point of practical import. In case 
the public press should pounce upon your brochure, I might be ob­
liged to speak, considering that chapters II and III consist in part of 
passages simply translated from the Capital, but separated by no 
marks of quotation from a remainder, much of which is not exact or 
even implies misunderstandings. 
I have written with that full frankness which I consider the first 
condition of friendly intercourse. 
Best compliments of Mrs Marx and myself to Mrs Hyndman. 
Yours very truly, 
K. M.

Dear Moor, 
In my last letter I quite forgot to mention money; owing to Schor-
lemmer's presence I have been somewhat restricted in my 
movements. You can now have £100 à £120, and it's simply a ques­
tion of whether you want it all at one go and how much is to be sent 
there and how much is for here. When you get this letter, make up 
your mind straight away so that I get your answer by  tomorrow.  For 
Schorlemmer and Pumps are going to the theatre tomorrow evening, 
while I shall remain at home. I can then at once make out a CHEQUE in 
favour of Lenchen and take it to her. You or your wife can of course 
decide what is to be done with the money. 
Tussy and Dolly Maitland acted very well; the girl showed a great 
deal of  SELF  POSSESSION and looked quite charming on the stage. Tussy 
was very good in the emotional scenes, though it was somewhat ap­
parent that she had taken Ellen Terry for her model, as Radford had 
Irving, but she'll soon wean herself from that; if she really wants to 
make her mark in public she must unquestionably  STRIKE  OUT  A LINE  OF 
HER OWN,  and she'll do that all right. 
I hear that the sea air has not yet had the desired effect on your 
wife;  that often happens in the early days; it may, and I trust will, 
come later. 
Pumps is going to Manchester with Schorlemmer on Mondaya  to 
bring back little Lydia; I hear you have written to Tussy asking her to 
join you. I may perhaps come later when Pumps is back. We shall 
probably be going to Bridlington Quay ' 6 ' shortly and then to Jersey 
with Schorlemmer when he returns from Germany; at any rate that's 
what we've planned to date. 
Best wishes from us all to your wife and  yourself.

Dear Sir, 
I am sorry my time will not allow me to write to you the statement 
you desire." However, if you wish to make yourself acquainted with 
the present state of the Labour Movement in Great Britain, you will 
find the necessary information in the weekly Labour Standard pub­
lished at 2 Whitefriars St. of which twelve numbers have up to now 
been issued. Most of the non-signed leaders are written by me. 163 
If you wish to enter into communication with Mr Most, you had 
better write to the Editor of the Freiheit, h 252 Tottenham Court 
Road, W., London, who will be able to tell you whether such com­
munication will be possible under present circumstances. 
I shall be glad to see you in case you should come to London.

*My dear Jenny, 
The doctor3 has just left Mama, and we shall start on Tuesday 
or Wednesday next. You will be informed by telegram of the exact 
day. 
Please write at  once,  because Mama will not get away from London 
before you have written her which things from London may be re­
quired by you. You know she is fond of that sort of commission-
business.* 
I enclose £5, since you will have to pay cash for the hire of bed-
linen etc.; the remainder will be paid when I arrive. Only on these 
terms will I agree to the arrangement you have suggested. 
As *to the story Hirsch has told you with respect to Lafargue, it is a 
mere lie. Lafargue, as I was sure from the beginning, has never writ­
ten anything of the sort to his Paris correspondents.

11 Boulevard Thiers 
Dear Engels, 
I can't write at any greater length today as I have a mass of letters 
to get off and on this, our first day, the little onesa have rightly laid 
claim to me. 
The journey from London to Dover went off  as well as could be ex­
pected, i. e. my wife, who was most unwell when we set out from 
Maitland Park, did not notice any change for the worse as a result of 
the journey. On the boat she at once went to the ladies' cabin where 
she found an excellent sofa to lie on. The sea was quite calm and the 
weather couldn't have been finer. She landed in Calais in better 
shape than when she had left London and decided to carry on. The 
only stations where our TICKETS allowed us to break the journey to 
Paris were Calais and Amiens. She thought the latter place (ABOUT 
2 HOURS'journey  from Paris) too close to stop at. Between Amiens and 
Creil she felt diarrhoea coming on, and the griping pains also grew 
more violent. At Creil the train stopped for only 3 minutes, but she 
had just enough time to do what was necessary. In Paris, where we 
arrived at 7.30 in the evening, we were met at the station by Longuet. 
However the direct train from this station to Argenteuil left too late 
for us to wait for it. So, after the  douaniers*  had examined our trunks, 
by CAB to St Lazare station and from there, after waiting some while, 
by RAILWAY to our destination which we did not reach, however, until 
ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK. She was in very poor shape, but this morning (at any 
rate now, ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK) feels better than she used to do in London 
at a similar hour. At all events, the return journey will be made in 
much easier stages. 
Longuet is introducing me to his doctor 1 today, so that we can act 
immediately in the event of the diarrhoea recurring.

We found everyone well here, except that Johnny and Harry had 
slight colds as a result of the change of temperature (all the children, 
especially Johnny, had been affected by the days of extreme heat). As 
a summer  residence  the house is first-class, must obviously have once 
served as such for a richard. a

It would seem that Tussy has written to her correspondent over 
thereb  telling him of my arrival and hence, or so Longuet tells me, 
this is already an open secret. The 'anarchists', he says, will impute to 
me the malicious intention of swinging the vote. 165 Clemenceau told 
him that I had absolutely nothing to fear from the police.

Dear Moor, 
I got your letterc yesterday morning before we left '6 ' and was 
very glad to hear that you did, after all, have a reasonably good jour­

far too risky, letting such an invalid remain on the go for 12 hours.

I only hope that the change of air and scene doesn't fail to produce 
the desired effect. 
We left at 10.30 and arrived here at 5.5, minus my trunk, which 
had gone astray, but turned up before evening. After perhaps a quar­
ter of an hour's search we found lodgings that were first-rate and not 
too dear (2 doors away from last year's, but a great improvement in 
every way). We had some rain yesterday, but today it seems to be 
slowly clearing up. The day before yesterday, by way of insuring my­
self against rainy weather such as we have again become familiar 
with lately in London, I went to fetch the Skaldin and the first two 
volumes of Maurer's Fronhöfe" from Tussy. 
Our present plan is to remain here for 3 weeks or, perhaps, 4, de­
pending on the weather and other circumstances. I have got some 
CHEQUES with me, so if you need anything, don't hesitate to let me 
know roughly how much you want. Your wife must not and shall not 
want for anything; if there's something she would like to have or 
something you know would give her pleasure, then have it she must. 
Tussy dropped in to see us the day before yesterday, so I accompa­
nied her home to fetch the books and drink the inevitable glass of Pil­
sener with her. Here one can pretty well do without German beer, for 
the BITTER  ALE in the little café on the pier is excellent, and has a head 
on it like German beer. 
Write again soon and tell me how things are. 
Warm regards from all of us to your wife and Jenny. Pumps sends 
her special love to Johnny, as do I. Our regards, too, to Longuet.

MARX TO ENGELS 166 
AT BRIDLINGTON QUAY 
Argenteuil, 3 August 1881 
11 Boulevard Thiers 
DEAR FRED, 
Drawing so heavily on your EXCHEQUER  is a great embarrassment to 
me, but the anarchy which has wrought havoc with the housekeeping 
over the past 2 years and given rise to all sorts of arrears has been op­
pressing me for some considerable time. On the 15th of this month 
I have £30 to pay in London, and this has been a weight on my mind 
since the day we left. 
When we shall return is far from clear. Every day we experience 
the same ups and downs here as we did in Eastbourne, 16° only with 
the difference — as for instance yesterday — that there are sudden 
and frightful bouts of pain. Our Dr Dourlen, who is an excellent doc­
tor and fortunately lives quite close by, immediately intervened and 
used one of the powerful opiates which Donkin had been deliberately 
keeping up his sleeve. After that she a had a good night and today feels 
so well that she got up for once as early as 11 o'clock and is finding dis­
traction in the company of Jenny and the children.b (The diarrhoea 
was STOPPED on the 2nd day after our arrival. From the start Dourlen 
had said that if it was merely an ACCIDENT, it didn't matter; but it 
might also be a symptom of an actual intestinal infection. Fortunately 
this was not the case, therefore.) 
The temporary 'improvements' do not, of  course,  inhibit the natural 
course of the disease, but they delude my wife and fortify Jenny — 
despite my objurgations — in the belief that our stay in Argenteuil 
should last as long as possible. I know better how things stand, and 
my anxiety is all the greater for that. Last night,  IN FACT,  was the first 
occasion on which I had anything like a decent sleep. My thoughts, 
they are so dull and dead as turned a mill-wheel in my head.c And 
this is why I have so far remained exclusively in Argenteuil, neither

visiting Paris nor writing so much as a line to anybody there encou­
raging them to come and visit me. Longuet has already heard 
Hirsch, a in the office of La Justice, express legitimate surprise at this 
'abstention'. 
And,  INTO  THE  BARGAIN,  a Kotzebue-like drama has been played out 
here during the past 5 days. 
Jenny had, for cook,  A VERY LIVELY YOUNG GIRL FROM THE COUNTRY with 
whom she was satisfied in every respect, since she also behaved most 
amiably towards the children. Her only testimonial from her last MIS­
TRESS,  wife of Dr Reynaud (another Argenteuil doctor), was a 'nega­
tive' one to the effect that she had quitted her service voluntarily. 
Old MOTHER Longuet who, so far as she is able, exercises a dictatorship 
over Jenny, was by no means satisfied with this, nor could she think of 
anything better to do than to go and write, off her own bat, to Ma­
dame Reynaud. 
Madame Reynaud is a pretty coquette and her husband a dissolute 
jackass; hence things happen in this couple's house that are much gos­
siped about in Argenteuil. They didn't know that  their  former maid had 
again taken service in the same locality, and with none other than 
Mr Longuet, an intimate friend of Dr Dourlen's whose wife was an 
intimate enemy of Madame Reynaud's! THIS WAS TO BE LOOKED 
AFTER. 
So one fine morning along comes Madame Reynaud — not, hith­
erto,  personally acquainted with Jennychen —, tells the latter that 
the girl had had improper affairs with men (et Madame?) and, what is 
worse, is a thief having, dans l'espèce, b stolen a gold ring of hers; she 
assures Jenny that she means to settle the matter en famille,' 
without appealing to the 'autorités' etc. Well and good, Jennychen 
SUMMONS  THE GIRL, Madame Reynaud chats with and  AT THE  SAME  TIME 
threatens her, the girl confesses, returns the ring —  whereat  Dr Rey­
naud denounces the unfortunate creature to the juge de paix. d UPSHOT: 
yesterday she was brought before the juge d'instruction' at Versailles. 
As you know, the  Code,  '67 being a relic of Roman Law whereby/amt-
lia = servi,' refers to Assizes petty crimes which would ordinarily 
come before a police court. 
In the meantime Jenny had made every imaginable representation 
to the juge de paix, an excellent man, but the matter had ceased to rest

with him the moment he had been officially notified of it. Neverthe­
less, Jenny's statements, which he wrote down, and la Reynaud's 
extra-judicial procedure, which she also placed on record, will be of 
some benefit to the girl. 
Jenny's defence of the girl surprised the juge de paix, but he took it 
all in a very light vein. Mais vous ne voulez pas défendre le vol? he 
asked her.— Mais non, Monsieur,  commencez  par arrêter tous les grands 
voleurs  d'Argenteuil, et de Paris par dessus le marché! a 
The immediate upshot is that she has no cook. The stupid  GIRL  from 
London — sister of our one-time Carry —  is GOOD FOR NOTHING IN THAT 
LINE and in any case has her hands full with the 4 children. 
Apropos. Nordau — who is taking Hirsch's place on the Vossische 
Zeitung — was awarded a French order! Whereupon Hirsch de­
nounced him to La Justicel The latter attacked the government for 
decorating such a traducer of France (he is a German-Hungarian 
Jew who attacked Tissot on Bismarck's behalf in his le vrai pays 
des milliards 168), likewise Bleichröder who wished to encumber 
la belle France with indemnities of 10 rather than 5 milliards. 169 
That jackass Nordau, presently in Paris, replied to La Justice, in 
a letter in which he made himself out to be the CHAMPION of France. 
Whereupon he was unmasked in La Justice and, the day after, in La 
République  française.

Dear Moor, 
Your letter arrived on the evening of the day before yesterday, to 
all intents open, thanks to the envelope. A trip to Flamborough Head 
had been arranged for yesterday, so I haven't got round to replying 
to you until today. 
As regards the paltry £30, don't let it give you any grey hairs. Un­
less I hear to the contrary I shall send off  in plenty  of time a CHEQUE for 
that amount to Tussy whom you will be instructing. Should you need 
more, however, let me know and I shall make the CHEQUE larger. For 
I only brought a few  CHEQUE  forms with me and have to be economi­
cal with them. 
Very many thanks for the news of the patient.a If I were you, 
I would stick as closely as possible to the period laid down by Donkin; 
I'm sure the local doctorb will also back you up there. Should the 
bouts of pain grow more frequent, they might well occur while you 
were en route and that could land you in a very serious predica­
ment. 
The business with the maid is at any rate funnier for us than for 
poor Jennychen. How fortunate that she should at least have Len-
chen there just now. It is impossible to know which of the two French 
bourgeoises  is the more admirable, old Mother Longuet who, on the 
pretext of finding Jennychen virtuous maids, sees to it that she is per­
petually maidless, or the good doctor's wife c who gives her word (wit­
hout which she would never have got her ring back) only to break it 
in the interests of public morality as soon as the ring is returned to 
her. 
Up here everything follows its usual somewhat dreary SEASIDE 
course, except that I've unfortunately had to give up bathing, as it

was making me deafer and deafer. I find this most disagreeable, but 
there's nothing else for it if I'm not prematurely to go about Allsop-
fashion. I am writing to Laura today, inviting her to spend some time 
here;  she can then so arrange things that she will be back in London 
at the time of your return, or at any rate shortly afterwards. 17° 
Enclosed a letter from Gumpert which will surprise you. I need 
hardly say that the person concerned is the sister, resident in Man­
chester, of Berta Böcker of London. a 
The award of an order to Nordau is really incomprehensible. It 
was only a short while ago that I saw his vile book, Aus dem wahren 
Milliardenlande, reviewed with the utmost satisfaction in the Köl­
nische Leitung. b But it agrees in one respect with Bleichröder as also 
with Nordau's conclusions, namely that there is still a remarkable 
amount to be got out of the country. Of this the starving Prussian 
Junkers will take mental note. 
My ink is running out; there is still just enough left for Laura, so 
I shall close, with warm regards to you all from

You're quite right not to bother about Paris any more than you 
think fit, whatever Hirsch and all the rest may say.

MARX TO CARL HIRSCH 
IN PARIS 
Argenteuil, 6 August 3 1881 
11 Boulevard Thiers 
Dear Hirsch, 
I have been here for nearly a fortnight '64; haven't visited Paris or 
any of my acquaintances. My wife's condition has permitted neither 
the one nor the other.

MARX TO ENGELS 
AT BRIDLINGTON QUAY 
[Argenteuil,] 9 August 1881 
DEAR FRED, 
Have just received your letter. I am registering this one; Longuet 
says that, while there can be no question of Stieberian tampering

with letters, registered ones, especially at little places like Argenteuil, 
are handled with greater despatch. 
On Satudaya  we took my wife to Paris; she watched it go by from 
an open carriage, which pleased her much (on myself it made the im­
pression of a foire perpétuelle b). A few pauses, of course, and SITTING DOWN 
BEFORE cafés. On the way back she felt momentarily sick, but 
wants to go there again. 
Her condition is, as usual, sometimes too much to bear, sometimes 
better for hours on end. She grows steadily thinner and at the same 
time weaker. Yesterday there was slight cutaneous bleeding which 
the doctorc considers a symptom of debility. I told him we must 
seriously consider going home; he said we could wait a day or two be­
fore finally deciding. She  herself,  after I had spoken to her about leav­
ing at the end of this week, played a trick on me by sending out 
a mass of washing which will not be  returned  until the beginning of  next 
week. At all events I shall let you know by telegraph when we are 
leaving (should there not be time SIMPLY to notify you beforehand by 
letter).  Oddly enough, though I get damned little rest at night and 
my days are racked with worry, everyone tells me how well I look — 
as is, indeed, the case. 
Jennychen's asthma is bad, the house being a very draughty one. 
The child is heroic, as always. 
On Sunday I was to show Helend  round Paris. I wrote and advised 
Hirsch e of it beforehand — and IN THE NICK OF TIME. He was just on 
the point of  leaving  for Germany (to the intense annoyance of Kaub 
and the chagrin of his wife). He wants to show the party leaders 
in Germany that there's nothing out of the way about expos­
ing oneself to apprehension by the police. He made off yester­
day. 
A pleasant couple, Jaclard and his Russian wife/ came to  déjeuner g 
here yesterday. Today we expect, for the same PERFORMANCE, Lissaga-
ray and our doctor's wife (along with her sister). 
From Jaclard we learned that he had attended an election meeting 
at Batignolles where the following put themselves up as candidates: 
Henry Maret, our Dr Regnard and —  Pyat,  who turned up — 
SELF-UNDERSTOOD  with the  permission  of the police — suddenly and unex­
pectedly. Pyat was frightfully jeered at. When he mentioned the

Commune there  was a  general  cry of '  Vous l'avez lâchéeP a Regnard 
fared  no  better.  In order  to appear paradoxical  and  profound,  the 
idiot opened with  the  declaration:  'Je suis contre  la UbertéP b GENERAL 
HOWLING!  His  subsequent declaration that  it was  'liberté  des  congrega­
tions' 1 c he had  meant availed  him  nothing.  The  champion  of anti-
clericalism  '7 2 was a  flop, likewise Henry Maret. 
It may be  that  the  extreme left will slightly increase  its numbers, 
but the  chief upshot  of this will  PROBABLY  be victory  for  Gambetta. 
Things being what they  are in  France,  the  shortness  of the election 
period will decide  the  issue  in favour  of  faiseurs d with numerous 
'strongholds'  in their possession, prospective bestowers of places  in the 
machinery  of government,  and the  men who  control  the  'exchequer', 
etc. The  'Grévystes' e could have licked Gambetta  if, after  the  latter's 
recent  FAILURES,  they  had had the  energy  to throw  his appendages,  Ca-
zot, Constans  and  Farre,  out of  the cabinet. Since they didn't,  the 
place-hunters, speculators  on the  Bourse,  etc., etc., are  saying  to 
themselves,  'GAMBETTA  IS THE  MANP  THEY  HAVE  NOT  DARED  TO ATTACK  HIM  IN 
HIS STRONGHOLDS,  YOU  CANNOT  RELY  UPON  THEM.The general onslaughts 
daily made upon  him  in the  radical  and  reactionary press  CONTRIBUTE 
TO ENHANCE  HIM  DESPITE  ALL HIS  TOMFOOLERIES.  On top of which the 
peasants regard Gambetta  as the  nee  plus ultra 1 in possible repub­
licanism. 
At the  same time  as this letter, another will  go off to  Tussychen, tel­
ling her  what  to do. I shall need  a little more money, since this time 
the journey  is going  to cost  a lot (the  doctor thinks, moreover, that 
a few  days  in Boulogne might  do the  patient good because  of the 
sea air),  we  shall have  to meet  a large doctor's bill  and  also make 
some compensation  to Jennychen  for all the  expenses  we  have  put 
her to. 
So Gumpert  is founding  a 3rd (or is it  2nd?) family? Good luck 
to him. It  seems  a sensible thing  for a  doctor  to do. My  wife  has 
heard  a number  of  people extolling  the  Böcker woman  of  Man­
chester. 
Salut.

MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE72 
IN LONDON 
[Argenteuil,] 9 August 1881 
Dear Laurachen, 
I can only write you a line or two as the post is about to go. 
Mama is in a serious condition as a result of her growing weakness. 
It was therefore my intention (as we shall only be able to travel by ea­
sy stages this time) to set off at all costs at the end of the week, 
and I informed the patient accordingly. Yesterday, however, she 
thwarted my plan by sending out our washing. So there can be no 
question of our leaving before the beginning of next week. 
We may — depending on the state she is in — stop in Boulogne for 
a few days. The doctor* thinks that (given favourable conditions) the 
sea air might momentarily have an invigorating effect. 
Next time (but for this purpose you must write at  once  giving me 
your latest address) I shall send you a fuller report. Best wishes to 
Paul.b

ENGELS TO GEORGE SHIPTON 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] 
Bridlington Quay, 
10 August 1881 
Dear Mr Shipton, 
I return the proof-sheet17  4 altered as you wish. The first passage 
you seem to me to have misunderstood and the second alteration is 
merely formal.a Anyhow, I do not see what good such alterations 
can do if asked for on Tuesday, received here on Wednesday, to 
arrive again in London on Thursday after the publication of the 
paper.b 
But there is another thing. If such  very  mild and innocent things as 
these begin to appear to you too strong, it must occur to me that this 
must be the case, in a far higher degree, with my own articles, which 
are generally far stronger. I must therefore take your remarks as 
a symptom, and conclude that it will be better for both of us if I dis­
continue sending you leading articles. It will be far better than going 
on until, upon some inevitable point, we come to an open rupture. 
Moreover my time will certainly not allow me to go on writing lead­
ers regularly, '6  3 and on this ground alone I had come to some similar 
resolution to be executed, as I then thought, after the Trades 
Union Congress.175 But the sooner I stop the better will be perhaps 
your position before that Congress. 
There is another point: I consider you ought to have sent me before 
publication the copy or proof of the article on the Max Hirsch Trades 
Unions in Germany, 0 as to the only man on your staff who knew any­
thing of the matter and could make the necessary notes to it. 
Anyhow it will be impossible for me to remain on the staff of a paper 
which, without consulting me, lends itself to writing up these Trades 
Unions, comparable only to those worst English ones which allow 
themselves to be led by men openly sold to, or at least paid by the 
middle class.

ENGELS TO MARX

Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire 
11 August 1881 
1 Sea View 
Dear Moor, 
Your registered letter arrived yesterday evening but it, too, was 
open, this time  completely.  I enclose the envelope for you to see; it 
just wasn't stuck down. 
I've this moment sent Tussy a CHEOJJE for £  50,  REGISTERED.  If you 
want all or part of the remaining £ 20 (over and above the £ 30 you 
spoke about) sent to Paris, Tussy can arrange things more quickly 
than if payment was made by a CHEQUE on London posted straight to 
you over there. She can easily get hold of a money order on Paris. 
As regards the French elections I am entirely of your opinion. 
This Chamber won't continue sitting much longer anyway; once the 
scrutin de liste' has come through, it will soon be dissolved again. 
Yesterday morning I informed Mr Shipton that he wouldn't be 
getting any more leading articles from me.b Kautsky had sent me an 
insipid thing on international factory legislation in a poor translation 
which I corrected and sent to Shipton.174 Yesterday the proof and 
a letter arrived from Shipton who thought 2 of the passages 'too 
strong', having, what's more, misconstrued one of them; he asked me 
a Here: result of the poll.-b See previous letter.

whether I would be prepared to tone them down. I did so and replied 
as follows: 
1. What did he mean by submitting me the request for amend­
ments on Tuesday"—i.e. Wednesday up here — when my reply 
couldn't have reached London until Thursday, after the paperb had 
come out. 
2. If he thought this too strong, how much more so my own far 
stronger articles? Accordingly it would be better for us both if I gave 
up. 
3. My time no longer permitted me to write a leading article reg­
ularly each week and I had already planned to inform him of this af­
ter the TRADE UNION CONGRESS (September).175  Under the circumstan­
ces, however, it would no doubt improve his position vis-à-vis that 
congress were I to give up then and there. 
4. He damned well ought to have shown me the Max Hirsch arti­
cle before  it was printed. ' 7 3 I couldn't remain * on the staff of a paper 
which lends itself to writing up these German Trade Unions, compar­
able only to those very worst English ones which allow themselves to 
be led by men sold to, or at least paid by the middle class*/ Apart 
from that I wished him the best of luck, etc. He will get my letter this 
morning. 
I didn't tell him the most vital reason of  all, namely, the total  inef­
fectiveness of my articles so far as the rest of the paper and its readers 
are concerned. Any effect there may be takes the form of an invisible 
response on the part of unavowed apostles of FREE TRADE. The paper re­
mains the same old omnium-gatherum of probable and improbable 
CROTCHETS; in matters of politics it is +  ,d but if anything more Glad-
stonian. The RESPONSE, which once showed signs of awakening in one 
or 2 nos., has died away again. The BRITISH WORKING MAN just doesn't 
want to advance; he has got to be galvanised by events, the loss of in­
dustrial monopoly. En attendant, habeat sibi.' 
We have been here for a fortnight now, weather changeable, 
mostly cold and often threatening, but not very often actually wet. 
We shall stay at least another week, perhaps a fortnight, but certainly 
no longer. 
Since I've been here I have been taking The Daily News instead 
of the  Standard.  It is even more stupid, if that's possible. Preaches anti-
vivisectionism! Also as deficient in news as the Standard.

ENGELS TO GEORGE SHIPTON 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] 
Bridlington Quay, 
15 August 1881 
Dear Mr Shipton, 
I cannot make it out, how you could so strangely misunderstand 
Mr Kautsky's article.174 To the first passage you objected because 
State interference went against the grain of'many prominent men in 
the Unions'. Of course it does, because they are at heart Manchester 
School '7  6 men and so long as their opinions of such are taken into ac­
count, no working-class paper is possible. But my addition to the 
passage in question must have convinced you, that the State interfer­
ence here alluded to, was such, and such only, as has been in England 
the law of the Land for years: factories and workshops' acts,177 and 
nothing further: things not objected to by even your 'prominent 
men'. 
As to the second passage, Mr Kautsky says: an international regu­
lation of the war of  competition  is as necessary as that of  open  warfare;  we 
demand a  Geneva Convention  178 for the workpeople of the world. The 
'Geneva Convention' is an  agreement  entered into by the various Gov­
ernments for the protection of wounded and ambulances in battle. 
What therefore Mr Kautsky demands, is a similar agreement be­
tween the various  Governments  for the protection of the workpeople not 
of one state only, but of  all, against overwork especially of women and 
a Carl Hirsch

children. How out ofthat you can make an appeal to the  workpeople  of 
the world to meet in a  Convention  of delegates  at Geneva,  I am utterly at 
a loss to understand. 3 
You will own that the occurrence of such misunderstanding on 
your part cannot at all encourage me to alter my resolution.b 
As to the Hirsch article, '" I do know Mr Eccarius and only too 
well for a traitor to the cause and it will be utterly impossible for me 
to write for a paper which opens its columns to him. 
Moreover, I do not see any progress. The Labour Standard remains 
the same vehicle of the most various and mutually contradictory 
views on all political and social questions which it was, perhaps una­
voidably, on the first day of its existence, but which it ought no longer 
to be by this time, if there was an undercurrent among the British 
working class tending towards emancipation from the liberal Capital­
ists. Such undercurrent not being shown itself up to now, I must con­
clude it does not exist. If there were unmistakable signs of its exis­
tence, I might make an extra effort to assist it. But I do not think that 
one column a week drowned as I might say amongst the remaining 
multifarious opinions represented in The Labour Standard could do 
anything towards producing it. 
And as I told you, I had resolved to stop writing after the Trade 
Unions Congress, '7  5 because of want of  time;  so whether I write a few 
articles more till then, would make no difference. 
So waiting and hoping for better times, I remain 
Faithfully yours,

a In the manuscript the following passage is crossed out here: 'If you had understood 
the drift of the article, you must have at once seen that here was a measure of an im­
mediately practical nature, so easy of execution that one of the existing governments of 
Europe (the Swiss Government) had been induced to take it in hand; that the proposal 
to equalize the hours of labour in all manufacturing countries by making factory and 
workshop's legislation a matter of international state agreement, was one of the 
greatest immediate interest to the working people. Especially to those of England who, 
besides the Swiss, are the best protected of all against overworking and therefore are 
exposed to an unfair competition on the part of Belgian, French and German work­
people whose hours of work are much longer.'-b See this volume, p. 119.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 180 
IN ZURICH 
Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire, 
17 August 1881 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Having spent the past 3 weeks at the seaside here, '6 ' I am making 
the most of the bad weather that has set in to drop you a few lines be­
fore I leave for home on Monday, the 22nd. If  I have time, I shall also 
write to Kautsky,b but he will in any case very shortly be getting a re­
ply and a copy of his article in The Labour  Standard.  '7 4 
I presume the anti-Semitica got back to you all right; I sent them 
to Kautsky as you hadn't let me have a more precise address. '8 ' Nev­
er have I seen anything so stupid and puerile. This movement is of 
importance only in the sense that in Germany — thanks to the co­
wardice of the bourgeoisie —  any movement instigated from above is 
of importance, namely as an electioneering ploy to obtain a conserva­
tive majority. As soon as the elections are over, or even earlier if the 
movement (as now in Pomerania) overshoots the mark set by those in 
higher places, it will, on orders from above, collapse like a pricked 
balloon and 'never more be seen'0 . Movements of this kind cannot be 
treated with too much contempt and I am glad that the Sozial­
demokrat  did so. '8 2 I have, by the way, heard from C. Hirsch who, act­
ing on a sudden whim, took a jaunt to Berlin, whence he writes 183: 
'The anti-Semitic movement has been organised entirely — one might almost say 
very nicely-b See this volume, pp. 140-42.-c  Goethe, 'Der Fischer'. 

=====第155页=====
79. Engels to Bernstein. 17 August 1881 127 
on orders — from above. I have gone into the poorest of haunts and no one has taken 
exception to my nose; nowhere, either in omnibuses or trains, have I heard a word 
spoken against the Jews. The semi-official papers, which hawk round anti-Semitic 
goods, have very few readers. Germans have a natural aversion to Jews, but I notice 
that the hatred felt for the government by working men as well as by petty-bourgeois 
and philistine progressives is far more virulent.' 
Of the thousand and one secret police in Berlin, he says that every­
one is aware who they are and 
'in consequence they know nothing. They are so naive that they always frequent 
the same pubs and sit at the same tables'. 
Your articles on the subject of'intellects' 184 are  very  good.  Again, 
your treatment of Bismarck's mania for nationalisation as something 
we should not endorse but which, like everything else that happens, 
nevertheless turns out  nolens  volens"  in our favour, is quite outstanding, 
and likewise your treatment of 'intellects' as being those of people 
who,  in so far as they are worth anything, come to us of their own ac­
cord but, in so far as we have first to recruit them, can only do us 
harm through what remains of the old leaven. There is much else of 
equal merit, though anyone could, of course, find occasional fault 
with the way things are put. The last number, too, was very good as 
a whole — the right kind of tone, brisk, assured, which the leaders 
had lost after the assassination attempts128 and the exceptional 
law,16 is back again and makes up for what Frederick William IV 
used to call 'trouser trumpetings'. You've given Bradlaugh a first-
class drubbing.b 
A few notes as to detail: 
1. There's no need to be so complimentary about Vallès. 185 He is 
a wretched man of letters, or rather, literatus, an absolutely worthless 
peddlar of stock phrases who, for want of talent, took up with extrem­
ists so as to dabble in tendencies — so-called isms — and thus find 
a market for his indifferent belletristic wares. During the Commune 
he did nothing but pontificate and, if he exerted any kind of influ­
ence,  it was for the worse. Don't allow Parisian cliquishness (for 
which Malon also has a great proclivity) to mislead you about this 
drôle de fanfaron.' What kind of politician he is may be seen from his 
letter to Grévy '86 when the latter became president, advising him to 
introduce the socialist republic par  ordre  du muftï A, etc., a letter which 
retarded the amnesty by many months.

2. The Spaniards are by no means a bunch of anarchists. There's 
a quite outstanding nucleus in Madrid (the erstwhile nueva federaciôn 
madrilena 187) and, in addition, some very good elements, notably in 
Valencia and in certain of the smaller Catalonian industrial towns, 
not to mention others dispersed elsewhere. The most energetic and 
clear-sighted is our friend José Mesa, presently in Paris, a quite excel­
lent fellow who also collaborates with Guesde and the rest of them 
over there, and keeps them in touch. If you want news about Spain, 
write to him in French (Malon will be able to forward the letter di­
rect or through Guesde — I haven't got his address up here). You can 
mention my name. 
On the whole I consider that a young man who is doing so well in 
and by his post as you, ought by rights to stick to that post. It is, 
I think, most questionable whether Kegel, who in any case is still in 
jug, would prove equally adaptable. What his theoretical standpoint 
is, I do not know, and in any case there is nothing to show that his 
qualifications are suited to anything more than a local paper, and 
a humorous one at that. LET  WELL  ALONE,  as the English say; don't try 
and improve on what is good. I must confess that the thought of any 
change fills me with mistrust and uneasiness. 
Well, now for the Revolutionary Congress.188 Lafargue has got 
hold of an Italian who was a delegate but — why I don't know — was 
thrown out. In addition, Lafargue has met various other members of 
that gang, likewise anarchists, at the house of a French wine and pro­
visions merchant. It appears that: 
1. The congress consisted of  twenty-odd  people, mostly  resident  in Lon­
don with mandates from elsewhere. Also a few Frenchmen and Ita­
lians and one Spaniard. They held their sessions in public. But not 
a soul turned up, neither dog, nor cat, nor reporter. After this vain 
wait for a public had lasted 3 or 4 days and still continued in vain, 
they took an heroic resolution and declared the sessions were to be  sec­
ret 
2. The first thing that was noted was the general disappointment 
caused by the ineffectuality of the anarchist movement as a whole, 
and the certain knowledge that nowhere at all was there anyone at all 
behind the vociferous few. Everyone knew this to be true of himself 
and his own locality and, although everyone had hoodwinked every­

their illusions that, even in the presence of strangers, they were un­
able to suppress their astonishment at their own ineffectuality. 
3. The congress was retrieved up to a point, first by the meeting to 
which, of course, they invited reporters, and next by the silly ques­
tions asked in Parliament by idiotic Tories and even more idiotic Rad­
icals.  In view of the present plague of nihilists, it was only to be ex­
pected that the press should make capital out of a meeting attended 
by at most 700 men. 
So when the  Freiheit  speaks of delegate No. 63, etc., ' 89 this refers to 
the number of the  mandate  made out by 1, 2 or 3 men, either in blank 
or in the name of a man wholly unknown to them and resident in 
London, or by 10-20 in the name of a delegate travelling to London. 
The number of delegates actually present was nearer 20 than 30, and 
of those who actually went there from elsewhere, certainly below 10. 
NB. All this to be used with circumspection, as I have it third-hand. 
E. g. your allusion to it might take the form of a question — whether 
that was how it happened. '90  The gentlemen always fasten on  one in­
accurate word. It's the same old story as in the case of all anarchist 
congresses. You should read in Fictitious Splits in the International 
what the fellows wrote about their own Congress of the Federation 
Jurassienne, or the account in the Alliance of Socialist  Democracy  of 
the first congress after the split.' 91 With those chaps, the first form 
anarchy assumes is that all want to be officers, and none rankers. 
Take, for instance, that raging anarchist Adhémar Schwitzguébel 
{quel nom!")  whose objection to acceptance of office from the state as 
a betrayal of the cause doesn't prevent him from being a lieutenant 
dans l' armée fédérale suisse  bl 
Kindest regards to yourself and also to Kautsky who will get a let­
ter when next it rains.

1 Sea View 
Dear Moor, 
Not until last night did I get your Argenteuil letter explaining your 
sudden arrival. I trust Tussy's indisposition is of no real signifi­
cance— she wrote me a cheery letter only the day before yesterday; 
at all events, I shall presumably hear further details tonight or tomor­
row morning, and also whether your wife accompanied you as far as 
Boulogne or Calais or whether she stopped off before that. 
Yesterday, then, I at last plucked up the courage to make a thor­
ough study of your mathematical mss. 192 without any reference to 
manuals and was glad to find I had no need of them. I offer you my 
congratulations. The thing is so crystal clear that one can only marvel 
at the obstinacy with which mathematicians insist on shrouding it in 
mystery. But that is what comes of those gentry's one-sided mentality. 
To write firmly and categorically  —-  = - could never enter their 
dy heads.  And yet it is obvious that — can only be the pure expres-
dx 
sion of a process undergone by x and y when the last trace of the terms 
x and y has disappeared and all that remains is the expression, free 
from all quantity, of the process of variation they are undergoing. 
There is no need to fear that some mathematician may have antici­
pated you in this. The above method of differentiating is, after all, 
much simpler than any other — so much so that I myself have just 
used it to deduce a formula that had momentarily slipped my mind, 
afterwards verifying it in the usual way. The process would undoubt­
edly create a great stir, especially since it clearly demonstrates that 
the usual method, ignoring dx dy, etc., is positively wrong. And the 
particular beauty of it is that only when — = - is the operation 
dx 0 
absolutely correct mathematically. 

=====第159页=====
80. Engels to Marx. 18 August 1881 131 
So old Hegel was quite right in supposing that the basic premiss for 
differentiation was that both variables must be of varying powers and 
at least one of them must be to the power of at least 2 or '/2- a Now we 
also know why. 
When we say that in y = f(x), x and y are variables, this is an asser­
tion which, so long as we continue to maintain it, has no implications 
whatsoever and x and y still remain, pro tempore? factual constants. 
Only when they really change, i. e. within the function, do they become 
variables in fact, nor does the relationship implicit in the original 
equation — not of the two quantities as such, but of their variabi-
Ay lity — come to light till then. The first derivate -— shows this rela-
; 5 Ax 
tion as it occurs in the course of true variation, i. e. in any  given  varia-
dy 
tion; the final derivate = — shows it purely and simply in its general­
ly .Ay 
ity and hence, from — we can arrive at any — we choose, while dx Ax 
this itself never covers more than the particular case. But in order to 
proceed from the particular case to the general relation, the particu­
lar case as such has to be eliminated. Hence, after the function 
has gone through the process from x to x' with all this implies, 
one can simply let x' revert to x; it is no longer the old x, a variable 
only in name; it has undergone real variation, and the result of 
that variation remains, even if we again eliminate that variation 
itself. 
Here at last we are able to see clearly what has long been main­
tained by many mathematicians who were unable to produce rational 
grounds for it, namely that the differential  quotient  is the prototype, 
while the differentials dx and dy are derived: the derivation of the for­
mula itself requires that the two so-called irrational factors should 
originally constitute one side of the equation and only when one has dy reduced the equation to this, its original form, — = f(x), can one do 
dx 
anything with it, is one rid of the irrational factors, replacing them 
with their rational expression. 
The thing has got such a hold over me that it not only keeps going 
round in my head all day, but last night I actually had a dream in 
a G. W. F. Hegel,  Wissenschaft der  Logik, Book I, Section II, Chapter 2. Note: Der Zweck

MARX TO ENGELS 
AT BRIDLINGTON QUAY 
[London],  18 August 1881 
DEAR FRED, 
No doubt you will by now have had the brief note I wrote you day 
before yesterday from Argenteuil and have gathered from it that I am 
here without my wife (not with  her as you necessarily supposed in your 
letter). 
On hearing the news of Tussy's condition I resolved to leave that 
very same day if possible; my wife, on the other hand, was to set off  to­
day with Helena and travel FIRST  CLASS,  first to Amiens and spend the 
night there; then, the next day, to Boulogne and rest there for at least 
a day, but 2 or 3 days if she wished; thence to Folkestone and, de­
pending on circumstances, from there straight on to London or else 
(and this seemed to me best), by a later train of her own choosing. It 
was, of course, distressing to part from her, but the REAL SUPPORT  FOR  HER 
IS Helen;  MY  OWN  PRESENCE wasn't absolutely necessary. Moreover, my 
departure compelled her finally to make up her mind to tear herself 
away from Argenteuil, which after all had got to happen in view of 
her growing weakness. 
So I left Paris on Tuesdayb evening at 7.45 by EXPRESS TRAIN via 
Calais, and arrived in London at ABOUT 6 O'CLOCK (MORNING). 
I at once telegraphed Dr Donkin who was here by 11 o'clock and 
" Demuth-b 16 August

had a long consultation with Tussy.  HER  STATE IS ONE  OF UTTER NERVOUS 
DEJECTION.  She  has  been eating next  to nothing  for  weeks, less than 
Dr Tanner during  his  experiment. 193 Donkin says there's  no organic 
trouble,  HEART  SOUND,  LUNGS  SOUND,  etc.; fundamentally the whole condi­
tion is attributable to a  PERFECT  DERANGEMENT  OF ACTION  OF STOMACH  which 
has become unaccustomed  to food  (and  she has  made matters worse 
by drinking  a great deal  of tea:  he at  once forbade  her all  tea)  and 
a DANGEROUSLY OVERWROUGHT NERVOUS SYSTEM.  Hence  SLEEPLESSNESS, NEURAL­
GIC CONVULSIONS,  etc. It was a miracle, he said, that a  COLLAPSE  of this 
kind hadn't happened before.  He  intervened  at once  and,  what  is 
most important  of all in this little person's case, brought  it home  to 
her that,  if she was  an obedient patient, there would be no danger,  but that 
if she insisted  on having  her own  way, all  would  be perdu." (Indeed  he is 
convinced that this  is so.)  Fortunately  she  promised  to do as he  said, 
and when  she  makes  a promise  she  keeps  it. Later  on, he  says, 
she will have  to go  away  in order  to distract  herself. 
Another reason  for  hastening  my  departure  was the  knowledge 
that Donkin intended  to take  his  HOLIDAYS  in the Hebrides from  17 Au­
gust.  He is  staying here until Saturday  on  Tussy's account  and  will 
then leave  a remplaçant*  for her and my  wife. 
At the  latest meeting  of électeurs  Mr Gambetta learnt something  in­
side the  MEETING-HALL  '7 9 that  he had  learnt only  at the  hands  of the 
crowd outside  the  meeting-hall  at the  first Belleville  MEETING.  194 This 
second meeting also consisted solely  of people  who  had  been invited 
by his own  COMMITTEE,  and  none  of them  was  admitted except after 
a twofold triage'  by the  stewards appointed  by the  comité. Hence  the 
uproar  was all the  more significant.  On  both occasions Galliffet! 
was the  cri that predominated. Thus Gambetta learnt  the  lesson that 
effrontery  of the Italian variety  is out  of place  in Paris.  Had  Rochefort 
been able  to speak  in public  and had he  thus been enabled  to offer 
himself then  and  there  as a  competing candidate, Gambetta would 
certainly have been defeated.  As a  result  of  what happened  at 
the time  of the Commune,  the  Belleville working-class population lost 
about 20,000  men,  most  of whom have been replaced  by  lower mid­
dle-class philistines.  And  even  the  remaining  or newly arrived work­
ing-class population  of Belleville (both arrondissements)  is one of  arrié­
rés, stick-in-the-muds, whose ideal,  if it goes beyond Gambetta, stops 
at Rochefort; both were returned  as deputies there  in 1869.

MARX  TO  JENNY LONGUET 
IN ARGENTEUIL 
[London,]  18  August  1881 
My dear sweet child, 
I came  to London,  i. e.c in  Maitland Park about  7 o'clock. 
Tussychen  is looking pale  and  thin, since weeks  she  eats almost 
nothing (literally);  her  nervous system  is in a  state  of utter dejection; 
hence continuous sleeplessness, trembling  of the hands, neuralgic con­
vulsions  of the  face,  etc. 
I telegraphed  at once  to Dr Donkin;  he put in his  presence  at 11 
o'clock (yesterday morning),  had a  long consultation with  and ex­
amination  of Tussy.  He  says that there  is no  organic disease, heart 
d workers'  party  -b in  embryo  -c more  or less a fiction-d  collectivist  workers'  party-

sound, lungs sound, etc., but only action of stomach quite deranged 
by her foolish way of living, and nervous system fearfully over­
wrought. 
He has succeeded to frighten her into obedience to his prescrip­
tions,  and you know, if she once gives way and promises, she will keep 
her promise. With all that, her recovery cannot but be slow, and 
I arrived in the very nick of time. There was the greatest danger in 
case of any further delay. 
Donkin was about — as he had informed me before our depar­
ture—  to leave this day London for the Hebrides. Because of Tussy, 
and hoping still to hear something of Maman, he will now stay till the 
end of the week. 
Tell me about the state of Maman, whether she has left you, etc. 
How is Longuet and Harra a? and yourself and the other dear chil­
dren b? 
How do you go on with your new servant? 
Apropos. Sarah 0 (Engels' Sarah), now for some hours daily the 
helpmate of Tussy, a girl of the best character and fitness for every 
thing, told Tussy that she had nothing liked better than to go with 
you, but Pumps did never tell her about Lizzy's having left you and 
about your want of a remplaçant d for her. She has also told Tussy and 
again  myself,  that she is still  ready  to come over to you. Only she dares 
not travel alone to France, but this matters little. I myself can bring 
her over later on. 
And now  adio,  dear child. The pleasure to be with you and the dear 
children has given me a more substantial satisfaction than I could 
have found anywhere else. 
My compliments to that excellent Dr Dourlen. 
With 1000 kisses for the children 
Yours, 
Old Nick

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 25 August 1881 
Dear Bebel, 
I would have replied sooner to your letter of  13.5.197  But, after the 
Leipzig 'local', 198  I waited to see whether you might perhaps send 
me another forwarding address; as you haven't I am using the old 
one, and also enclosing a letter from Tussy Marx to Mrs Liebknecht, 
for whom we haven't got an address either. 
Bernstein still writes to say he wants to leave the  Sozialdemokrat,  and 
now proposes that Kegel be taught the ropes and, once he knows 
them, appointed in his place. My view is that any change would be 
for the worse. Bernstein has made good, so greatly exceeding our ex­
pectations (for instance, his articles on 'intellects' 184 were, trifles 
apart, quite excellent and written along exactly the right lines) that it 
would be hard to find anyone better. Kegel hasn't proved  himself,  at 
any rate in this sphere, and, as things stand now, all experimentation 
should be avoided. I have urgently requested Bernstein to stay,3 and 
believe you could do no better than give him similar advice. In his 
hands the paper is getting better and better, and so, too, is he. He has 
genuine tact and is quick on the uptake—just the reverse of Kautsky, 
who is an exceptionally good chap, but a born pedant and hair-
splitter in whose hands complex questions are not made simple, but 
simple ones complex. Like all the rest of  us, I am very fond of him as 
a person and, in longer articles of the review type, he might occasion­
ally do something pretty good, but even with the best will in the 
world he can't go against the grain,  c'est  plus fort  que  lui.h On a news­
paper, a doctrinaire of this kind is a real disaster; even Edec  was 
forced to append a critical note to one of  his articles in the last  Sozialde­
mokrat. On the other hand, he has written a fly-sheet for the consump-
» See this volume, pp. 85-86 and  128.-b  it's too much for him-c  Eduard Bern­
stein

tion of peasants in Austria" in which he gives proof of something of his 
mother's 15 gift for short story writing; aside from one or two erudite 
expressions, it's really good and should be effective. 
I wrote to Liebknecht about the speeches in the Landtag, and in 
reply 199 was told that these had been a matter of'tactics' (but I had 
pointed out that it was precisely those tactics that prevented us from 
siding openly with him) and that speeches of a different kind would 
shortly be made in the Reichstag. True, this has now been done by 
you200—but what is one to think of Liebknecht's unfortunate and 
wholly unnecessary remark about the 'Reich Chancellor's hones­
ty'201 ? It may have been meant ironically, but that's not evident 
from the report, and what capital the bourgeois press made out of it! 
I have sent no further reply — it does no good, after all. But Kautsky, 
too, has told us not only that Liebknecht is writing letters all over the 
place — e.g. to Austria — saying Marx and I are in complete agree­
ment with him and had sanctioned his 'tactics', but also that people 
believe him. This really can't go on indefinitely! Again, the Freiheit 
has got a lot of fun of HartmannV speech on the Accident Bill 202 
which, if the passage they quote is genuine, was certainly a pretty 
wretched affair. 
In France, working-class candidates obtained 20,000 votes in Paris 
and 40,000 in the provinces 203 and, if their leaders hadn't perpetrat­
ed one stupidity after another since setting up the collectivist work­
ers' party, things would have gone even better. But there, too, the 
masses are better than most of their leaders. For instance, several Par­
isian candidates lost thousands of votes through using empty revolu­
tionary verbiage (as much part of the business in Paris as patter is of 
trade) in the provinces as well where it was taken seriously and peo­
ple asked: 'How can you make a revolution without weapons and or­
ganisation?' For the rest, developments in France are taking their 
regular, normal and very necessary course along peaceful lines, and 
that is a very good thing just now, for otherwise the provinces could 
not be swept earnestly into the movement. 
I understand very well that your fingers should itch, when every­
thing's going so nicely for us in Germany and you, having your hands 
tied, cannot reap the fruits of victories that are all but falling into 
your laps. But this does no harm. Many people in Germany have set

too much store by overt propaganda (Viereck, who was completely 
cast down by the impossibility of making overt propaganda, is just 
one striking example of  this),  and too little by the real impetus of his­
torical events. It can do nothing but good if experience acts as a cor­
rective in this case. The fact that we cannot reap the fruits of our vic­
tories at the  moment  in no way means that they are lost to us. The gal­
vanising of the indifferent, inert masses can only be effected by actual 
events and even if, in present circumstances, those thus galvanised are 
left in a state of some considerable bewilderment, the word of deliver­
ance will, when the time comes, strike home with all the more force; 
the effect upon state and bourgeoisie will be all the more drastic when 
the 600,000 votes 204 are suddenly multiplied threefold, when, besides 
Saxony, all the big towns and industrial districts fall to us and even 
rural workers are, for the first time, so situated as to be intellectually 
accessible to us. To take the masses by storm in this way is of far great­
er value than to win them over gradually by  overt  propaganda which, 
under present circumstances, would in any case quickly be stamped 
on. As things are now, the Junkers, clergy and bourgeois  cannot  allow 
us to cut the ground from under their feet and hence it is better to let 
them take care of this themselves. For a time will surely come when 
a different wind will blow. Meanwhile it's you people who must in 
person go through the mill, it's you who must endure the infamies of 
the government and the bourgeoisie, and that's no laughing matter. 
But mind you don't forget any of the dirty tricks played on yourselves 
and on all our people; the day of retribution is nigh and it must be ex­
ploited to the full.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN ZURICH 
London, 27 August 1881 
Dear Mr Kautsky, 
In a day or two you will be getting by post 1. The Labour Standard 
containing your article," in connection with which there have been 
sundry comic interludes, 2. a Nature of 18 August, 3. your ms. back. 
After I had somewhat revised what was an altogether bungled 
translation, I sent it to Shipton for a leading article. However, the 
worthy Shipton got it all wrong and complained to me,b but as usual 
too late. God knows what the man took the bit about 'State interfer­
ence'  in favour of the workers to mean — certainly not what it said, 
nor that such State interference has long existed in England in the 
shape of  FACTORIES  AND WORKSHOPS  ACTS.  '7 7 Still worse: into the words WE 
DEMAND  A GENEVA CONVENTION '7  8 FOR THE WORKING CLASSES he read a de­
mand by you for  the convening  of a conference  of delegates  in Geneva  to settle 
the matter!! What can one do with such an oaf? I made this business 
the occasion to go ahead with my decision and break with The Labour 
Standard, as that paper is getting worse rather than better. 
In Mature you will find a speech made by John Simonc before the 
international Medical Congress here  2 °5 in which the  bourgeoisie  is vir­
tually  put on the mat by  medical  science.  J. Simon is  MEDICAL  OFFICER  TO THE 
PRIVY COUNCIL,206 virtual head of Britain's entire public health in­
spectorate, and the same who is so frequently and approvingly quot­
ed by Marx in Capital, a man — perhaps the last of the old really 
professional and conscientious officials of the 1840-60 period who, in 
the performance of his duty, everywhere found that bourgeois inter­
ests were the first obstacle he was obliged to combat. Hence, his in­
stinctive hatred of the bourgeoisie is as violent as it is explicable. Now 
he, a doctor, finding his own special field invaded by the Church-led 
bourgeoisie and their anti-vivisection movement, has turned the 
tables on them. Instead of preaching dull and colourless sermons like

Virchow, he goes into the attack comparing the/««; scientific experi­
ments made by doctors on animals with the vast  commercial  experi­
ments made by the bourgeoisie upon the popular masses, thereby 
placing the question for the first time in its true perspective. An 
extract from this would make a splendid feuilleton for the Sozialde­
mokrat.  2 °7 
The Congress, by the way, declared unanimously that vivisection 
was essential to science. 
Your fly-sheeta shows that you have inherited something of your 
mother's15 gift for short story writing. It pleased me more than any­
thing you have written hitherto. A little more polishing might have 
enabled you to improve one or two expressions and turns of speech, 
and I would advise you to do this in the case of a second edition. Lit­
erary German is a very clumsy idiom for narrative prose and erudite 
words such as reaction, which mean nothing to the peasant, ought to 
be avoided. The thing is worthy of being seriously revised by you 
along these lines. It is the best fly-sheet I have ever seen. 
Your Mostian chaps in Austria will have to learn by painful expe­
rience; there are no two ways about it. It's a process during which 
many otherwise good elements come to  grief,  but if those elements are 
positively intent on conspiring for the fun of it and with no particular 
purpose in mind, there's no helping them. Luckily the proletarian 
movement has an enormous reproductive capacity.

cliquism, an itch for oratory, etc. Le Citojen has, it seems, been sold to 
the Bonapartists who have not yet unceremoniously kicked our men 
out, but have stopped their pay and otherwise treated them en canail-
le,A as though trying to push them into striking and so get rid of them. 
On top of that, all our chaps have fallen out with one another, 
as so often happens when things go wrong. One of the most unhappy 
is Brousse, a thoroughly honest chap but a consummate muddle-head 
and one who positively insists that the entire movement should de-

vote itself to converting erstwhile anarchist friends. It was he, too, 
who was originally responsible for the crazy resolution concerning the 
rejection of candidature.208 For the rest, the steady, peaceful course 
of events in France can, in the long run, only prove favourable to us. 
Not until the provinces have been drawn into the movement, as has 
been happening since 1871, and emerge, as they are increasingly do­
ing, as a power in the land — along normal legal lines, that is,— can 
an end be put in the interests of us all to the spasmodic form hitherto 
assumed by developments in France, derived from coups in Paris and 
for years retarded by reaction in the provinces. Then, when the time 
has come for Paris to act, it will not have the provinces against it, but 
behind it.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 211 
IN ZURICH 
London, 25 October 1881 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I am most grateful to you for having written to me about the 
Egalité business. 212 Aside from the point at issue, this provides me 
with an opportunity of letting you know what is Marx's attitude, and 
hence also my own, towards the French movement. And from this 
one instance you will be able to gauge our attitude towards other 
non-German movements, in so far as these are in sympathy with us 
and we with them. 
I am glad that you are not at present in a position to give financial 
support to the Egalité. Lafargue's letter was another of those  coups  de 
tête' which the French, in particular those south of the line Bordeaux-
Lyons, now and again find themselves unable to resist. So certain was 
he of perpetrating a stroke of genius and a blunder rolled into one, 
that he didn't even tell his wife b (who has prevented many such 
things) about it until after the event. With the exception of Lafargue, 
who is always in favour of'something being done', n'importe quoi, c we 
over here were unanimously against Egalité No. 3. d I confidently 
a impulsive actions-b Laura Lafargue-0 no matter what-d  Engels means the third 
series of L'Egalité.

predicted that, with their  5,000  frs (if  as much), they would last out 
for 32 numbers. If Guesde and Lafargue are intent on acquiring the 
reputation in Paris of  tueurs  dejourneaux, a we can't stop them, but nor 
shall we do anything else. If, contrary to all expectation, the paper 
improves again, and if it gets really good, we shall always be able to 
see what can be done if it finds itself in a predicament. But it's abso­
lutely essential that these gentlemen should learn at last how to stand 
on their own feet. 
The fact of the matter is that, during the past 12 or 15 months, our 
French friends, who are trying to set up the parti ouvrier, b have made 
one blunder after another, and this applies to all of them without ex­
ception. The first was committed by Guesde when, for absurdly pur­
ist reasons, he prevented Malon from accepting the editorship of the 
labour department on the Intransigeant at a salary of 12,000 frs. That 
was when the whole squabble began. This was followed by the unpar­
donable folly over the Emancipation, when Malon allowed himself to 
be misled by the false promises of the Lyonnais (the worst working 
men in France), while Guesde showed himself no less feverishly an­
xious to have a daily paper à tout  prix. c Next came the hair-splitting 
over the matter of candidature,208  in which connection it is more 
than probable that Guesde was guilty of the solecism you reprobate, 
though it is obvious to me that Malon was  seeking  to pick a quarrel. 
Finally, the ingress into, followed by the egress from, the Citoyen 
français, of Mr Bourbeau, alias Secondigné, an adventurer of the worst 
repute — his egress being due simply to non-payment of salary, not to 
any political motive. Next, Guesde, in very mixed company, joined 
the most recent Citoyen, and Malon and Brousse the miserable Pro­
létaire which they — or Malon at any rate — had always secretly 
opposed as a vulgar loutish rag. 
The Prolétaire was the organ of the very narrowest clique of the 
most inveterate scribblers among the Parisian workers. It was axio­
matic that access could be had and contributions made only by ge­
nuine manual workers. The most bigoted Weitlingian 'scholar'-
baiting was the order of the day. The sheet was in consequence quite 
without substance, while preening itself on being la plus pure expres­
sion 0 of the Parisian proletariat. Hence, for all its apparent cordiality, 
it always secretly looked upon other papers, including the 2 Egalités, 
as mortal enemies and intrigued against them.

=====第174页=====
146 89. Engels to Bernstein. 25 October 1881 
When Malon now maintains that the French workers' party is en­
deavouring to create an organ for itself in the  Prolétaire,  and questions 
the need for a competing Egalité, no one is better aware than 
Malon, 1. that the two first Egalités also existed alongside the Pro­
létaire  simply because 2. nothing could be made of the  Prolétaire,  and 
Malon knows the Prolétaire people just as well as Guesde does, and 
3. that the few blockheads on the  Prolétaire,  together with Malon and 
Brousse, don't by any means make up the whole of the French work­
ers' party. Hence he knows that all this is a red herring and that it is 
he who is seeking to create an organ for himself'in the  Prolétaire,  hav­
ing made things too hot for himself everywhere else. 
But the link that binds Malon and Brousse to this potty little sheet 
is their common jealousy of Marx. To the majority of French social­
ists it is an anathema that the nation which confers upon the world 
the boon of idées françaises  * and has a monopoly of ideas—that Paris, 
centre des lumières h — must now all of a sudden import its socialist ideas 
ready-made from a German, Marx. But there's no denying the fact 
and, what is more, Marx's genius, his almost excessive scientific scru­
pulousness and his incredible erudition place him so far above all the 
rest of us that anyone who ventures to criticise his discoveries is 
more likely to burn his fingers than anything else. That is something 
which must be left to a more advanced epoch. If, then, French social­
ists (i. e. the majority) are obliged, whether they like it or not, to bow 
to the inevitable, it will not happen without a certain amount of 
grumbling. It is the Prolétaire people who say, of both Guesde and 
Lafargue, that they are Marx's mouthpieces or, translated into more 
familiar idiom, that ils veulent vendre les  ouvriers français aux  Prussiens  et à 
Bismarcks And in everything M. Malon writes, this grumbling is 
most plainly audible and, what's more, in most ignoble form: Malon 
is at pains to find or impute other progenitors (Lassalle, Schäffle and 
actually De Paepe!) on whom to father Marx's discoveries. Now it is, 
of course,  perfectly in order to disagree with party members, no mat­
ter whom, as to their mode of procedure in this or that case, or to dis­
pute or differ on a point of theory. But thus to contest the right of 
a man like Marx to his own achievements is to betray a pettiness such 
as is found, one might almost say, only in a compositor,— a race of 
whose self-conceit you will surely have had ample experience. I sim-
a French ideas-b centre of enlightenment-0 they want to sell the French workers

ply cannot understand how anyone can be envious of genius; it's 
something so very special that we, who have not got it, know it to be 
unattainable right from the start; but to be envious of anything like 
that one must have to be frightfully small-minded. The furtive way 
Malon goes about it, doesn't improve matters. The fact that it is he 
who eventually comes out worst, betraying his lack of knowledge and 
discernment at every turn, is something of which he might at some 
time be made unpleasantly aware, should it at any time become ne­
cessary to scrutinise Malon's goodly Histoire du Socialisme 'depuis les 
temps les plus reculés'* (!!) and other productions with an eye to 
their substance. 
Brousse is, I think, the most hopelessly muddle-headed man 
I have ever known. He has dropped the anarchy —  i. e. opposition to 
political activity and voting — out of anarchism, while at the same 
time retaining all its other catchwords and, more notably, its tactics. 
Thus,  in tedious articles in the Prolétaire directed against Guesde 
(but not naming him), he is currently brooding on the insoluble ques­
tion of how to set up an organisation in such a way as to preclude 
a dictatorship (Guesde's!!). If this consummate literary and theoreti­
cal ignoramus, whose forte, however, is cliquism, is again able to play 
a part, the blame must be shared by Lafargue, Guesde and Malon. 
Lastly Guesde. In matters of theory this man is by far the most lucid 
thinker amongst the Parisians, and one of the few who takes no excep­
tion at all to the German origins of present-day socialism. Hinc Mae 
lacrimae} Which is why the gentlemen of the Prolétaire are letting it 
be known that he is merely Marx's mouthpiece, a rumour which, 
with lugubrious mien, Malon and Brousse carry further afield. Out­
side that clique no one dreams of such a thing. What there is to it, we 
shall see anon. That he is domineering may well be true. Every one of 
us is domineering in the sense that he would like to see his views pre­
dominate. If Guesde seeks to do this by direct and Malon by tortuous 
means, it says much for Guesde's character and for the superiority of 
Malon's worldly wisdom — especially in dealing with people like the 
Parisians who obstinately dig their heels in if you try to dictate to 
them but are only too delighted to let you lead them by the nose. 
Come to that, whenever I have heard anyone who is worth his salt 
described as domineering, I have only been able to conclude that 
a from the earliest times. See B. Malon, Histoire du  socialisme depuis les temps les  plus reculés 
jusqu'à  nos  jours. - b Hence those tears (Terence, Andria, I, 1, 99). 

=====第176页=====
148 89. Engels to Bernstein. 25 October 1881 
there was nothing that could really be said against the man. Guesde's 
failings are of quite a different kind. First, the Parisian superstition 
that the word revolution is something one must continually bandy 
about. And secondly, boundless impatience. He is suffering from 
a nervous complaint, believes he has not much longer to live and is 
absolutely determined to see something worthwhile happen before he 
goes.  That, and his morbid excitability, provide the explanation for 
his exaggerated and sometimes destructive thirst for action. 
If, in addition, you take the inability of the French, especially the 
Parisians, to conceive of differences that are other than  personal,  and it 
is obvious enough how it was that these gentry, as soon as they had 
scored a few small successes, saw themselves already at the goal, 
sought to divide as yet inexistent spoils, and fell out with each other in 
the process. 
Guesde's pamphlets and articles, by the way, are the best to have 
appeared in the French language, and he is, moreover, one of the best 
speakers in Paris. Also, we have always found him forthcoming and 
reliable. 
Now for ourselves. We, i. e. Marx and I, do not even correspond 
with Guesde. We have only written to him for specific reasons of busi­
ness.  We have no more than a general idea of what Lafargue says in 
his letters to Guesde, nor have we by any means read everything 
Guesde writes to Lafargue. Heaven only knows what plans the two of 
them have exchanged of which we have no inkling. Every now and 
again Marx, like  myself,  has transmitted advice to Guesde via La­
fargue, but it has hardly ever been taken. 
It is true, however, that Guesde came over here when the question 
arose of drafting a programme for the French workers' party. 68 
The considérants  to this was dictated to him by Marx," here in my own 
room, in the presence of Lafargue and  myself:  the worker is free only 
when he is the owner of his instruments of labour — this may assume 
either individual or collective form — the individual form of owner­
ship is being daily and increasingly superseded by economic develop­
ments, hence, all that remains is that of communal ownership, etc.— 
a masterpiece of cogent reasoning, calculated to explain things to the 
masses in a few words; I have seldom seen its like and, even in this 
concise version, found it astonishing. The remaining contents of the 
programme were then discussed; we added this and took out that, but 
See K. Marx, 'Preamble to the Programme of the French Workers' Party'. 

=====第177页=====
89. Engels to Bernstein. 25 October 1881 149 
as for Guesde being Marx's mouthpiece, how little this holds water is 
evident from the fact that he insisted on including his nonsense about 
the minimum du salaire*  and since not we but the French were respon­
sible for the thing, we eventually gave him his head, although he ad­
mitted that, theoretically, it was absurd. 
Brousse was in London at the time and would have liked to join us. 
But Guesde was short of time and anticipated, not incorrectly, that 
Brousse would engage in tedious arguments about ill-digested anar­
chist terms; he therefore insisted that Brousse should not attend this 
meeting.  C'était  son affaire} But Brousse has never forgiven him for it 
and it's to that time that his intrigues against Guesde go back. 
This programme was subsequently discussed by the French and ac­
cepted with a few alterations, including Malon's which were by no 
means improvements. 
Then, too, I wrote 2 articles for the Egalité No. II on Le socialisme de 
M. Bismarck' and that, so far as I'm aware, is the sum total of our 
active participation in the French movement. 
But what mainly annoys the small-minded carpers who count for 
nothing, yet like to think themselves all-important, is the fact that 
Marx, thanks to his theoretical and practical achievements, has at­
tained a position in which he enjoys the complete trust of the best people 
in all the labour movements in the various countries. At critical junc­
tures  it is to him they turn for advice, when they generally find that his 
advice is the best. He occupies that position in Germany, in France, 
and in Russia, not to speak of the smaller countries. Hence it is not 
Marx who imposes his opinion, let alone his will, on these people; 
rather it is these people who come to him of their own accord. And it 
is precisely on this that Marx's peculiar influence rests, an influence of 
the utmost importance to the movement. Malon also wished to come 
here,  but to procure a special invitation from Marx through La-
fargue, which naturally he didn't get. We were as prepared to deal 
with him as we are with anybody else de bonne  volonté, 6 but invite him! 
Why? Who has ever had an invitation of that kind from us? 
Marx's attitude, and hence also my own, towards the French is the 
same as towards the other national movements. We are constantly in 
touch with them in so far as it is worth our while and opportunities 
a minimum wage-b It was his business.-0  F. Engels, 'The Socialism of Mr Bismarck, 
MI',  L'Égalité, Nos. 7 and 10, 3 and 24 March 1880 (see present edition, Vol. 24).-

present themselves, but any attempt to influence people against their 
will would only do us harm, destroy the old trust that dates from the 
International. And we have, after all, too much experience in  revolu-
tionaribus rebus" to do that. 
Now for two more FACTS. 
1. It was Guesde, and with him Lafargue, who, in the Egalité, 
brought quite undeserved fame to Malon, turned him, as it were, into 
a legend, and this simply because Guesde thought, in typically 
French fashion, that as a writer one had to have a working man beside 
one. 
2. And here is something the recipient of the letter has authorised 
me to tell you: Lissagaray, who was the chairman of the meeting at 
which Malon arraigned that blackguard Lullier, writes to say that, 
just as the meeting was supposed to begin, Lullier sent word to Malon 
requesting a short discussion. Malon departed, didn't return, and fi­
nally his  Comité  went in search of him (Lissagaray was the chairman of 
the Comité  and the meeting) only to find him toping most jovially and 
on the brink of a peaceable understanding with Lullier, the man he 
had (rightly) described as the dirtiest of blackguards. Had not Malon 
had to leave at 9 o'clock for the congress at Zurich, 213 there would 
have been the risk of a full reconciliation. And he describes himself as 
a man of politics! 
Mesa's address is: J. Mesa, 36 Rue du Bac, Paris. 
Marx knows nothing about this letter. He has been in bed for the 
past 12 days with bronchitis and all kinds of complications, but since 
Sundayb — due precautions having been taken — there has no longer 
been any danger. I've been anxious enough, I can tell you. Now 
things are looking up and tomorrow, 27 October, we shall, I trust, 
show the world that we are still there as large as life.2 '4 Kindest 
regards to Kautsky.

As regards the Egalité, I think it would be best if our people were 
not to found a new paper for the time being, at any rate until the state 
of affairs within the party has become a little less obscure. If they do 
want to start one, however, neither we nor anyone else can stop them, 
though I don't see how it's going to be managed this time without

Dear Old Man, 
Your postcard re the congress2 '5 arrived too late for me to write to 
you about it. Since then we have also had sundry calamities over 
here.  Mrs Marx has been in bed for months, critically ill, and then 
Marx went down with bronchitis accompanied by all sorts of com­
plications which, at his time of life and considering the general state 
of his health, was certainly no laughing matter. Fortunately the worst 
is over and, so far as Marx is concerned, all danger has been com­
pletely eliminated for the time being, though he has to spend the 
greater part of the day in bed and is greatly weakened. 
Herewith money order for 4 pounds sterling = 100 frs 80 c. which 
is what I have to send you this time. I trust it will come in handy for, 
delighted though I am to hear that you have been able to make 
a start at earning a living, it is after all only a start and I'm only sorry 
that of late I myself have been somewhat short and therefore unable 
to step into the breach any sooner. 
I'm always glad when a so-called international congress passes off, 
as it did on this occasion, without anyone making an ass of himself in 
public. You always get such a hotchpotch of people attending these 
affairs, some of whom have no other object than to look important in

public and who for that very reason are capable of any stupidity. 
Well, this time it went off without any mishap. 
Our people in Germany have given a splendid account of them­
selves at the elections.216 In 23 or 27 constituencies (I can't find out 
the exact number) they were in the second ballot, despite the fact that 
on this occasion all the other parties turned out to the very last man. 
And this under the stress of the exceptional law 16 and state of siege,65 
without a press, without meetings, without any means of public agita­
tion and in the certain knowledge that by way of return the livelihood 
of some thousands within the party would again be sacrificed. It is al­
together splendid and the impression it has made throughout Europe, 
and particularly here in England, has been quite tremendous. How 
many seats we get is neither here nor there. Enough anyway to say 
what is necessary in the Reichstag. But the fact that we have gained 
ground in the larger towns instead of losing it — that is first rate and 
here's three cheers for our lads in Germany!

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 217 
IN ZURICH 
London, 30 November 1881 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
If any one outside event has contributed to putting Marx more or 
less to rights again, then it is the elections.2 '6 Never has a proletariat 
conducted itself so magnificently. In England, after the great defeat 
of 1848,218 there was a relapse into apathy and, in the end, resigna­
tion to bourgeois exploitation, with the proviso that the TRADES UNIONS 

=====第181页=====

fought individual battles for higher wages. In France the proletariat 
disappeared from the stage after the 2nd December.219 In Germany, 
after 3 years of unprecedented persecution and unrelenting pressure, 
during which any form of public organisation and even communica­
tion was a sheer impossibility, our lads have returned, not only in all 
their former strength, but actually stronger than before.16 And strong­
er in one crucial respect, in that the movement's centre of gravity has 
shifted from the semi-rural districts of Saxony to the large indus­
trial towns. 
The bulk of our people in Saxony consist of hand-loom weavers, 
who are doomed to obsolescence by the power-loom and are only just 
enabled to keep going by starvation wages and secondary occupa­
tions (gardening, toy carving, etc.). These people find themselves in 
an economically reactionary situation and represent an obsolescent 
stage of production. So they are not born representatives of revolu­
tionary socialism — not, at any rate, to the same degree as are the 
workers in large-scale industry. Hence they are not reactionary by 
nature (as, for instance, the remaining hand-loom weavers eventually 
became  over  here — the hard core of the 'CONSERVATIVE WORKING MEN') but 
cannot be relied upon in the long run. This is also very largely due to 
their appallingly miserable condition, which means that they have 
far less power of resistance than townsmen, and also to their disper­
sion, which makes them easier to enslave politically than the inhab­
itants of large towns. The facts reported in the Sozialdemokrat" fill 
one with admiration for the heroism with which so many of those 
poor devils continued to stand firm. 
But they are not the right kind of nucleus for a great national mov­
ement. In certain circumstances — as in 1865-70 — their poverty ren­
ders them more readily receptive to socialist views than the inhabi­
tants of large towns. But this same poverty also makes them unreli­
able.  A drowning man clutches at any straw, nor can he wait for 
a boat to push off from the bank and come to his rescue. The boat is 
socialist revolution, the straw, protective tariffs and state socialism. It 
is significant that there, in our old constituencies, it was almost only 
conservatives who stood any chance against us. And if, on a previous 
occasion, Kayser could talk such rubbish about protective tariffs 22° 
without anyone's venturing any real objection, whose was the 
a 'Warum sind wir in Glauchau (Sachsen) unterlegen?',  Sozialdemokrat,  No. 47, 17 No­
vember 1881.

154 91. Engels to Bernstein. 30 November 1881 
blame — as Bebel himself remarked in a letter to me 221 —if not the 
constituents', and Kayser's in particular? 
Now everything's different. Berlin, Hamburg, Breslau, Leipzig, 
Dresden, Mainz, Offenbach, Barmen, Elberfeld, Solingen, Nurem­
berg, Frankfurt am Main, Hanau, as well as Chemnitz and the Erz­
gebirge districts — that's backing of quite a different order. A class 
that is revolutionary by reason of its economic situation has come to 
be the nucleus of the movement. Aside from that, the movement is 
evenly distributed over the entire industrial area of Germany and, 
from being restricted to a few local centres, has only now come to be 
a national  movement.  And that is what frightens the bourgeois most 
of all. 
As regards those who have been elected, we shall have to hope for 
the best, although I find it very difficult to do so where some of them 
are concerned. But it would be a disaster if, this time, Bebel were not 
to be returned.222 For there will be many new elements—each 
armed, no doubt, with his own little schemes — whom Bebel alone, 
with his unerring tact, would be able to keep in order and prevent 
from making asses of themselves. 
As regards the French, it would now be best simply to let Messrs 
Malon and Brousse have their head, and show what they can do. But 
it's unlikely to come to that. One of these days the Egalité will ap­
pear; Brousse will, as before, be guardedly libellous, launching at­
tacks in the Prolétaire without naming names, while the others, fall­
ing headlong into the snare, will, in their attacks, name names from 
the outset, whereupon they will be hailed as disturbers of the peace, 
sectarians, spreaders of dissension and budding dictators. Nothing 
can be done to stop this. The fellows are completely incapable of 
waiting until their opponents have got into a mess of their own con­
triving, but must perforce take issue with them and thus give them 
a longer lease of  life. Left to their own devices Malon and, more espe­
cially, Brousse would scupper themselves (and probably each other) 
within 6 months. But as things are, it may take longer. 
Like almost all such congresses, the Congress of Rheims 223  served 
to impress the outside world but, seen in the cold light of day, was 
a swindle. Of the 'federations' represented there, only the Centre, 
Nord and Est really exist; the others exist only on paper. The Al­
gerian federation had elected the  bourgeois  Henry Maret  {radical  depu­
ty) as its delegate!!, which just shows what kind of allies Malon has 
got. Guesde had wanted only  properly organised  federations to be re-

presented on the  Comité  national—but his proposal was turned down. 
This was  misrepresented,  i. e. suppressed,  in the official account in the Pro­
létaire.' Thus, half the delegates to the congress and on the  Comité  na­
tional represent  nothing  at all, or at best only castles in Spain. The haste 
to declare the Prolétaire, already completely taken over by 
Malon and Brousse, an official gazette was due solely to the desire to 
steal a march on the forthcoming Égalité. As usual, none of the reso­
lutions on organisation were determined by expediency but by the 
opportunist considerations of the parties concerned. 
Here is something that will give you an idea of Malon's Marxo-
phobia: last spring he asked Lafargue, when the latter was in Paris, to 
obtain from Marx a foreword to the new edition of Malon's Histoire du 
Socialisme;  needless to say, Lafargue laughed in his face and told him 
he must have a very poor idea of Marx if he thought him capable 
of lending himself to such humbug. 
G. Howell, luckily not returned as 'labour candidate' for Stafford, 
is undoubtedly the biggest blackguard of all the politicantib ex-
working men here. He was until recently secretary of the TRADES 
UNIONS PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE (needless to say, a salaried post) and 
took occasion to cook the books, this being only hushed up with some 
difficulty; however, he was given the sack. 
Within the next few days I shall write to K. K. of Käsburg 0 about 
the Polish affair. 224 In the meantime, give him my best regards. 
Marx is still very run down, isn't allowed to leave his room or 
engage in any serious occupation, but he is visibly gaining weight. 
His wife is growing ever weaker. 
With best regards, 
Yours,

MARX TO JENNY LONGUET » 40 
IN ARGENTEUIL 
London, 7 Décembre 1881 
My dear, sweet Jennychen, 
You will, assuredly, find it quite natural that I should not feel in 
the mood for 'writing' at the moment and hence only now be sending 
you this brief note. Since I haven't yet even left the sick room, there 
was no gainsaying the doctor's interdict on my attending the funeral. 
Moreover I resigned  myself,  for only the day before her death our 
dear departeda had told her  NURSE,  apropos some neglected formality: 
'WE ARE NO SUCH  EXTERNAL  PEOPLE!' 
Schorlemmer came up from Manchester of his own accord. 
I still have to paint my chest, neck, etc., with iodine and, when reg­
ularly repeated, this produces a somewhat tiresome and painful in­
flammation of the skin. The said operation, which is only being per­
formed to prevent a relapse during convalescence (now complete 
apart from a slight cough), is therefore doing me sterling service just at 
this moment. There is only one effective antidote for mental suffering, 
and that is physical pain. Set the end of the world on the one hand 
against a man with acute toothache on the other. 
It now gives me extraordinary happiness to recall that, despite nu­
merous misgivings, I ventured on the trip to Paris. Not only because 
of the time itself that she, of undying memory, spent with you and the 
little  onesb  — 'barely' marred by the image  OF A CERTAIN  DOMESTIC  BULLY 
et Mirabeau  de la cuisine,'  but also the reliving ofthat time during the fi­
nal phase of her illness. There can be no doubt that during that 
phase the presence of you and the children could not have distracted 
her to such good purpose as her mental preoccupation with you all! 
Her resting-place is fairly close to that of dear 'Charles'.d 
It is a comfort to me that her strength gave out before it was too 
late. Because of the highly unusual location of the growth — which 
meant that it was moveable, not static—the really typical and un­
bearable pain did not set in until the very last days (and even then

could still be kept within limits by the injection of morphine which 
the doctor had intentionally held in reserve for the end, since with 
protracted use it ceases to have any effect). As Dr Donkin had predict­
ed, the course of the illness assumed the form of a gradual decline, as 
in the weakness that comes of old age. Even during her last hours, 
there were no death agonies, a gradual falling asleep, her eyes larger, 
lovelier, more luminous than ever. 
Apropos. Engels — as always the truest of friends — has sent you 
at my request a copy of the Irish World in which an Irish bishop de­
clares himself against landownership (private). This was one of the 
last items  of NEWS  I passed on to your  mamma,  and she thought you might 
get it into A FRENCH PAPER so as to horrify the French  clericals.  At all 
events it shows that such gentlemen are able to pipe any tune they 
like. 
(In La Justice of  2 December 1881 a certain laddie by the name of 
B. Gendre" seeks, under the title lLe catholicisme socialiste  en Allemagne' , 
to assuage his chauvinism by taking au sérieux, b like Laveleye before 
him, the fanciful  statistics  of our friend R. Meyer (in his book Emancipa-
tionskampf des 4. Standes). The fact is that, since the German 
Empire came into being, the so-called Catholic socialists have only 
once  elected a deputy to the Reichstag and that, from the moment of 
his election, he 'figured' only as a 'member of the Centre'. 225 As to 
the numerical strength of  the Catholic labour unions, on the other hand, 
our R. Meyer accords France a number disproportionately greater 
even than that he accords Germany.) 
Have just received La Justice of 7  Décembre  and see that, under the 
rubric Gazette  du jour, there is an obituary, which says inter alia: 
' On devine que sori  (il s'agit  de votre mère)  'mariage  avec  Karl Marx, fils d'un  avocat de  Trêves, 
ne se fit pas sans peine. Il y avait à  vaincre  bien des préjugés, le plus fort de tous était en­
core le préjugé de race. On sait que l'illustre  socialiste  est d'origine Israélite.'' 
Toute cette  histoire d is A SIMPLE «TEA-TOW, THERE WAS ,VO préjugés  à vaincre' * I

genius with this literary* 'enjolivement'/ * The same writer when

your mother) 'marriage to Karl Marx, son of a Trier barrister [Heinrich Marx], did not

mentioned in another number of the Justice — 'Lassalle and Karl 
Marx', the former having never printed or spoken a syllable on the 
matter in question. Longuet would greatly oblige me in never men­
tioning my name in his writings. 
The allusion to your Maman's occasional anonymous correspon­
dence (in fact in behalf of Irving) 226  I find indiscreet. At the time she 
wrote to the Gazette de Francfort (she never wrote to the Journal de 
Francfort  — as the Justice calls it—, a simply reactionary, and philis-
tine paper) the latter (the Gazette) was still on more or less friendly 
terms with the socialist party. 
As to the 'von WestphalenfsJ', they were not of Rhenish, but of* 
Brunswickian origin. *The father of your mother's fathera was the 
factotum of the* notorious  * Duke of Brunswick* (during the 'seven 
years'  war'). As such he was also overwhelmed with favours on the 
part of the British government and married a near relative of the Ar­
gyll's.0  His papers relative to the war and politics have been published 
by the Minister v. Westphalen.d  On the other hand,* 'par sa mère,' e 
* your mother descends from a small Prussian functionaryr  and was 
actually born at Salzwedel in the Mark. All these things need not be 
known, but knowing nothing of them, one ought not to pretend cor­
recting* d'autres s 'BIOGRAPHIES'. 
* And now, my dear child, send me a long description of the doings 
of Johnny et Co. I still regret that Henry was not left to us at the time 
he went on so well. He is a child who wants a whole family's atten­
dance being singly, exclusively concentrated upon him. As it is, with 
so many other little ones requesting your care, he is rather an impedi­
ment.

[Postcard] 
London, 10 December 1881 
Dear Friend, 
You may have already learned from the papers of my wife's death 
(she breathed her last on 2 December). You will find it natural 
enough that, during the first days following upon this irreplaceable 
loss, I should have been in no state to write letters; in fact, apart from 
her brother, Edgar von Westphalen, in Berlin you are the only one 
whom I have so far informed in person; other friends and acquain­
tances have been notified by my youngest daughter.b 
To the last my wife remained your loyal friend and was rightly in­
censed by the party's failure to help you — a man who has, for so 
many years, been a staunch and heroic standard bearer — and your 
loyal spousec in your struggle for existence. 
I myself am still an invalid, but on the road to recovery; so serious 
a grip had pleurisy combined with bronchitis gained over me that for 
a time, i. e. several days, the doctors doubted whether I would pull 
through. 
Farewell, dear friend. Regards to your wife.

MARX TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
London, 13 December 1881 
My Dear Friend, 
On the second of this month, after a long and painful malady, I lost 
my wife. I had been with her during the autumn months — as her 
garde-malade," first to the English seaside (Eastbourne), afterwards to 
Argenteuil (about 20 minutes from Paris) where she and myself 
enjoyed together the great pleasure to be with our eldest daughter 
(Madame Longuet) and her 4 little boys b (the eldest about 5 years), 
all exceedingly attached to their grandparents. 
It was a very risky affair, on my part, to undertake this voyage to 
Paris,  considering the enfeebled state of my dear wife. But trusting to 
my excellent friend, Dr Donkin, I dared it in order to procure her this 
last satisfaction! 
Unfortunately, my own health having been more or less shaky 
during all this time, I suddenly underwent — after our return to 
London — an attack of bronchitis complicated by a pleurisy, so that 
during 3 out of the last 6 weeks of her life, I could not see my wife, 
although we were in two rooms contiguous to each other. 
Till now I was not yet able to leave my house. I was very near 
'leaving this bad world'. The doctors want to send me to the south of 
France or even to Algeria.

95. Marx to Sorge. 15 December 1881 161 
The letters of condolence I have received from all sides were so far 
a great source of consolation for me, as there rang through them (ex­
cept a single Russian letter) a true ring of sympathy, of true acknowl­
edgment and understanding of the rare qualities of my dear wife. 
My German editora informs me that a third edition of the Capital 
has become necessary. This comes at a moment anything but oppor­
tune.  In the first instance I must first be restored to health, and in the 
second I want to finish off the 2nd vol.227 (even if to be published 
abroad) as soon as possible. I have now the additional interest to 
have it ready in order to inscribe in it a dedication to my wife. 
However that may be, I will arrange with my editor that I shall 
make for the 3d edition only the fewest possible alterations and addi­
tions,  but, on the other hand, that he must this time only draw off 
1,000 copies, instead of 3,000, as was his want. When these 1,000 co­
pies forming the 3d edition are sold, then I may change the book in 
the way I should have done at present under different circumstances. 
Believe me always

I myself had not recovered sufficiently to pay her my last respects. 
Indeed, I have so far been confined to the house, but am to go to 
Ventnor (Isle of Wight) next week. 
I am emerging from this last illness doubly handicapped, emo­
tionally by the loss of my wife, physically in that I am left with a 
thickening of the pleura and increased sensitivity of the bronchial 
tubes. 
I shall, alas, have to fritter away a certain amount of time on schemes 
for restoring my health. 
Another edition of the German text of Capital2  2 7 has now become 
necessary. Most inopportune so far as I'm concerned. 
Your Henry George is increasingly revealing himself to be a 
humbug. 
I trust Sorge jun. arrived in good shape; give him my regards.

The English have latterly begun to take rather more notice of  Capi­
tal, etc. For instance, in last October's (or November's, *I am not 
quite sure *) issue of the  Contemporary,  there was an article by John Rae 
on GERMAN  SOCIALISM.  a (Very inadequate, full of mistakes, but -FAIR', as 
one of my ENGLISH  FRIENDS  remarked to me day before yesterday.) And 
why FAIR?  * Because John Rae does not  suppose  that for the forty years 
I am spreading my pernicious theories I was being instigated by  'baa" 
motives.* 'I must praise his magnanimity!' *The fairness of making 
yourself at least sufficiently acquainted with the subject of your criti­
cism seems a thing quite unknown to the penmen of British philis-
tinism. 
Before this, in the beginning of  June,  there was published by a cer­
tain Hyndman (who had before intruded himself into my house) a little 
book: England for All. It pretends to be written as an  exposé  of the 
programme of the  'Democratic Federation  '5 8— a recently formed asso­
ciation of different English and Scotch radical societies, half bour­
geois,  half prolétaires} The chapters on Labour and Capital are only 
literal extracts from, or circumlocutions of, the Capital, but the fel­
low does neither quote the book, nor its author, but to shield himself 
from exposure remarks at the end of his preface:

'For the ideas and much of the matter contained in chapters II and III, I am 
indebted to the work of a great thinker and original writer, etc., etc' 
Vis-à-vis  myself,  the fellow wrote stupid letters of excuse, for in­
stance, that 'the English don't like to be taught by foreigners', that 
'my name was so much detested, etc' With all that his little book — 
so far as it pilfers the  Capital  — makes good propaganda, although 
the man is a 'weak' vessel, and very far from having even the pati­
ence—  the first condition of learning anything — of studying a matter 
thoroughly. All these amiable middle-class writers — if not special­
ists—  have an itching to make money or name or political capital 
immediately out of any new thoughts they may have got at by any 
favourable windfall. Many evenings this fellow has pilfered from me, 
in order to take me out and to learn in the easiest way. 
Lastly, there was published on the 1st December last (I shall send 
you a copy of it) in the monthly review Modern Thought an article: 
'Leaders of Modern Thought: No. XXIII — Karl Marx. By Ernest 
Belfort Bax.' 
Now this is the first English publication ofthat kind which is pervad­
ed by a real enthusiasm for the new ideas themselves and boldly 
stands up against British philistinism.This does not prevent that the 
biographical notices the author gives of me are mostly wrong, etc. In 
the exposition of my economic principles and in his translations (i. e. 
quotations of the Capital) much is wrong and confused, but with all 
that the appearance of this article, announced in large letters by pla­
cards on the walls of West End London, has produced a great sensa­
tion. What was most important for me, I received the said number of 
Modern Thought already on the 30th of November, so that my dear 
wife had the last days of her life still cheered up. You know the pas­
sionate interest she took in all such affairs.*

My Dear Child, 
Tussy, SUPPORTED  BY Engels, is this moment taking the Christmas 
hamper for our little ones by CAB to the PARCEL COMPANY. Helen a wants 
me to point out specially that 1 little jacket for Harry, 1 for Eddy,b 
and a woollen bonnet for Pa ' are from  her;  again for the selfsame Pa, 
a 'little blue frock' from Laura; from myself a  SAILOR  s SUIT for MY  DEAR 
Johnny. On one of the last days of her life, Möhmchen d laughed so 
merrily when telling Laura how you and I took Johnny to Paris, and 
chose a suit for him there in which he looked like a little  bourgeois 
gentilhomme.' 
The letters of condolence I get from near and far, and from people 
of such various nationalities, professions, etc., etc., are, in their appre­
ciation of Möhmchen, all of them animated by a spirit of truth and 
a depth of feeling rarely found in what are as a rule merely conven­
tional tributes. I ascribe this to the fact that everything about her was 
natural and genuine, unforced and without affectation. Hence the 
impression she made on others was one of vivaciousness and lucidity; 
even Mrs Hess writes: 
'In her, Nature has destroyed its own masterpiece, for never in my life have I met so 
witty and loving a woman.'229 
Liebknecht writes to say that, without her, he would have suc­
cumbed to the wretchedness of exile, 230 etc., etc. 
How exceptionally healthy she was by nature, for all her delicate 
constitution, is evident from the fact that, despite being bed-ridden 
for so long, she did not have a sore spot on her body, much to the as­
tonishment of the doctors; during my recent illness I already had 
a number of sore places after only two weeks of being confined to bed.

The weather has been very bad since I got over my illness, so 
I have been under house arrest up till now, but next week, on doctors' 
orders, I am to go to Ventnor (Isle of Wight) and from there, later 
on, somewhere further south. Tussy will accompany me. 
You will be getting (posted at the same time as this) an article 
about me in the monthly review Modern Thought.1  It's the first time an 
English critic has gone into the matter with such enthusiasm. It ar­
rived in time to cheer Möhmchen up. Where the QUOTATIONS from the 
German 'text' are too bad (I MEAN too badly  DONE  INTO  ENGLISH), I have 
got Tussy to write in corrections on such few copies as we are reserv­
ing for friends. The mistakes that occur under the heading 'LIFE' are 
indifferent. 
And now, my dear child, the best service you can do me is to keep 
your chin up! I hope that I shall spend many more happy days with 
you and worthily fulfil my functions as a GRANDPA. 
With a thousand kisses to you and the little ones,

MARX TO LAURA LAF ARGUE 72 
IN LONDON 
Ventnor, 4 January 1882 
1 St Boniface Gardens 
Dear Laurachen, 
Today is our first sunny and tolerable day in Ventnor. The 
weather is said to have been excellent — up till the time of our arri­
val. 234 Thereafter  GALES  EVERY  DAY,  wind raging and howling through­
out the night, in the morning THE  SKY  OVERCAST,  LEADEN,  LONDONLIKE. Tem­
perature significantly lower than in London and, on top of that, and 
most tiresome of  all, a great deal of rain. (The air itself was of course 
'purer' than in London.) 
In the circumstances it was only natural that my cough,  IN FACT  my 
bronchial catarrh, should have got worse rather than better. But for 
all that I have progressed to the extent that for part of the night 
I sleep naturally, without opium, etc. However my general condition 
is not such as to render me fit for work. Today,  ABOUT  the end of the 
first week of our stay, it looks as though a change is setting in. Given 
warmer weather this would certainly be a splendid health resort for 
convalescents of my description. 
My companion3 (this strictly  between ourselves)  eats practically noth­
ing; suffers badly from nervous tics; reads and writes all day long, 
when not engaged in buying the necessary provisions or taking short 
walks.  She is very taciturn and, INDEED, seemingly endures stay­
ing with me simply out of a sense of duty, as a self-sacrificing martyr. 
Has there been no more news from Jenny about the arrival of the 
CHRISTMAS Boxb? I'm worried about the thing.

You will understand, dear child, if I have nothing positive to report 
to you from here, my experiences hitherto having been purely nega­
tive, unless it be the great discovery that local literature here is repre­
sented by 3 newspapers, and that there is even  A SCHOOL  OF ART and SCI­
ENCE  INSTITUTION where a big lecture is to be given next Monday even­
ing ON THE CASTES AND  'MÉTIERS'  OF INDIA. 
Today I received a letter from Reinhardt in Paris in which he 
speaks of our sad bereavement a in the MOST SINCERE and MOST SYMPA­
THETIC manner. The vehemence with which the bourgeois papers in 
Germany have announced either my demise, or at any rate the in­
evitable imminence  thereof,  has tickled me hugely, and the 'man at 
odds with the world' will have to get fit for action again, if only to 
oblige them. 
Willard Brown has written to Tussy from New York; he has entrust­
ed the business of your house to a very intimate and competent 
friend of his in new Orleans235; the latter has written to say that 
AT FIRST  SIGHT  there has been a great deal of underhand work but that 
he must first make further investigations in order to obtain actual 
proof. 
I enclose, as a curiosity for Paul,b a cutting from the MONEY ARTICLE in 
The Times (29 December 1881) which was obviously inserted by 
Messrs Say and Rothschild/(Regards to Paul and Helen.d)

MARX TO ENGELS 140 
IN LONDON 
Ventnor, 5 January 1882 
1 St Boniface Gardens 
Dear FRED, 
Cold and wet during the day, raging winds at night; that, by and 
large, is the kind of weather and climate we've been experiencing 
here up till today.234  — The exception was yesterday, when it was 
dry with brilliant sunshine.— According to letters received by Tussy, 
it has been the same everywhere on the south coast of England; disap­
pointment everywhere on the part of the not inconsiderable number 
of convalescing, etc., rabble. Qui vivra  verra.*  Perhaps there will be 
a change for the better. 
I now wear— {au cas de besoin b)—a muzzle, alias RESPIRATOR; this 
makes one less dependent on the caprices of the weather when taking 
one's obligatory walk. 
I still have a tiresome and persistent cough and bronchial catarrh; 
but it's an undoubted step forward that I should get a few hours sleep 
at night without recourse to artificial remedies, and this despite the 
roar of the wind across the sea close by; on the contrary, the noise 
helps to send me to sleep. 
My companion, Tussy, is sorely plagued with nervous tics and in­
somnia, etc. However I hope that her frequent excursions in the fresh 
air — for she goes into 'town' every day to attend to this and that — 
will have a beneficial effect on her. 
What has tickled me greatly was the announcement by the LIBERAL 
ASSOCIATION — I no longer recall where, Birmingham perhaps236 — 
that, in celebration of some ANNIVERSARY or other, not only will OLD 
Bright and THE ILLUSTRIOUS VESTRYMAN AND CAUCUSMAN Chamberlain be 
speaking, *but that also old Obadiah's 'son', Mr Jacob Bright jun.237 
and several 'Miss'  Cobden,  are to put in their appearance. It is not said 
whether one of the 'Miss' Cobden or all of them will be given away to 
the young Obadiah, so as to perpetuate in the most appropriate and 
safest way the Bright-Cobden stock.*

A different picture is presented by the 3,000 LANDLORDS'MEETING  AT 
Dublin,238  duce*  Abercorn, the sole aim of which is *'to maintain... 
contracts and the freedom  between  man and man in this realm'.* The lad­
dies'  rage at the ASSISTANT COMMISSIONERS is comical.Their attacks on 
Gladstone are, by the by, fully justified, but it is only the latter's COER-
CITIVE [sic] MEASURES and his 50,000 men,123 not counting the po­
lice, that permit these gentlemen to confront him in so critical and 
threatening a manner. All this uproar is, of course, merely aimed 
at getting John Bull ready to pay 'compensation costs'. SERVES HIM 
RIGHT. 
You will see from the enclosed letter from Dietzgen that the un­
happy fellow has 'progressed' backwards and safely 'arrived' at the 
Phänomenologie. 239 I regard the case as an incurable one. 
I have also had a very kind letter of condolence from Reinhardt in 
Paris who asks me to give you, amongst others, his kindest regards. 
He always had a soft spot for my beloved partner. 
I wish I were fit for action again; not yet reached that stage, alas. 
With best wishes from Tussy.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 
IN ZURICH 
London, 6 January 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I am writing to you in haste today in order to shed some light on 
the peculiar expressions that occur in the last number of the Égalité 
under the leadership of 

=====第201页=====
103. Engels to Bernstein. 6 January 1882 173 
on the subject of the Sozialdemokrat. The point is that, out of the 
goodness of his heart, Guesde engaged for the German section of the 
paper a person known to be the mortal enemy of everything apper­
taining to 'Zurich', 3 and the said person was unable to refrain from 
thus expressing his displeasure that the Sozialdemokrat should survive 
and not the Laterne. You would oblige us and serve the cause by tak­
ing no notice of  this.  If it happens again, we shall at once put a stop to 
it. By contrast, we were delighted that the Sozialdemokrat should not 
have hesitated to accuse the deputies of downright cowardice, thus 
bringing matters to a head, something which many of them, had Be-
bel not been there, would doubtless have sooner avoided. 240 
The Egalité people, by the way, have been luckier than,  aufond, b 
they deserved. Malon and Brousse made horrible fools of themselves 
in connection with Joffrin's candidature by putting forward a 
watered-down programme — in defiance of the congressional 
resolution passed at Rheims, 223 and quite simply suppressed one of 
the points discussed there, just because it happened not to suit their 
book (Egalité, No. 4, p. 7, Paris). 0 In this way they put the Egalité 
in the right which, in the circumstances and on tactical grounds, 
was absolutely imperative — not Guesde and Co., but Malon and 
Co., were the real 'autoritaires', d the strivers after dictatorship. 1 And, 
now that the struggle has come out into the open, I need hardly say 
that our sympathies lie wholly with Guesde and his friends. More­
over, the Egalité is, and always has been, infinitely superior to the 
Prolétaire  as far as content is concerned. Malon and Brousse are again 
behaving like true Bakuninists: they accuse others of hankering 
for dictatorship and, under pretence of maintaining their 'auto­
nomy', want to rule the roost themselves without regard for party 
resolutions. 
Marx is at Veninor in the Isle of Wight, but writes to say that the 
weather is atrocious/ worse than here. Well, it will soon change, no 
doubt; at all events, there would now seem to be no real danger of 
a relapse. The haste the bourgeois press was in to disseminate 
the news of his confidently anticipated demise did him no end of 
good: 'Now I must live to a ripe old age, if only to spite the damned 
rascals.'

Kautsky will have to be patient for a few more days. Schorlemmer 
is still here, which means that the most that I can do is dabble in 
natural science; on top of that, there's all the coming and going 
which won't be over until next week. Then, when time's no object, as 
Schorlemmer says Darmstadt-fashion, I'll write to him about the 
Poles. 3

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN VENTNOR 
London, 8 January 1882 
Dear Moor, 
We were glad to hear that there was no reason for yours and Tus-
sy's silence and, even though you couldn't be expected to make very 
much progress in view of the adverse weather, you have at least bene­
fited to the extent that the danger of a relapse has now been pretty 
well eliminated, which was, after all, the main reason why you were 
sent to Ventnor. 
The festive season here ends tomorrow. Schorlemmer will be re­
turning to Manchester, and then it's back to the grindstone. I am 
looking forward to it; things were really getting too much. Tuesday 
with Lenchen, Friday with Pumps, yesterday with the Lafargues, to­
day here at my house — and every morning the eternal Pilsener; it 
couldn't go on indefinitely. Lenchen was always one of the party, of 
course, and still is, so she hasn't felt too lonely.

By the time you get this note you will have been edified by old Wil­
liam's 3 magnificent proclamation in which he avows his solidarity 
with Bismarck and declares all this to be the free expression of his own 
opinion.241 I also liked the bit about the inviolability of the person of 
the monarch having persisted in Prussia since time immemorial. Par­
ticularly when one considers the shots fired by Nobiling. 12° How 
comforting for Alexander II and III that their persons should be in­
violable! One might, by the way, imagine that one was living under 
a travesty of Charles X when one reads that sort of drivel. 
There has been yet another nice item in The Standard, a letter from 
a Russian general about the situation and the Nihilists,242 just like 
what used to be said and written by the Prussian generals of 1845 
about demagogues,243 liberals, Jews, the bad principles of the 
French, and the universal and undying loyalty to the king felt by the 
sound core of the nation. Which didn't, of course, set the revolution 
back one day. You will have seen that the zemstvos37 have rebelled 
against Ignatiev, partly via the medium of petitions, partly by an out­
right refusal to convene.244 That is a most important step, the first to 
be taken by official bodies under Alexander III. 
Like you, we hope for better weather. Yesterday was very fine 
with a north-wester from which you will have been sheltered. Schor-
lemmer and I were on the go the whole day and it was not until half 
past midnight that we accompanied Lenchen home from Laura's, 
covering the whole distance on foot. Today it's been beastly and 
wet, though during a brighter spell we got out and about for an hour 
or so with Sam Moore who turned up again the day before yesterday. 
It's blowing good and hard again outside. How is Tussy actually? 
Regards to her and to you from us all.

MARX  TO ENGELS 166 
IN LONDON 
Ventnor,  12 January  1882 
1 St Boniface Gardens 
Dear Engels, 
I am  going  to try  spending  one  more week here  (the 3rd as  from 
today);  so far  there's been  no improvement  in the  weather  — if  any­
thing  the  reverse.  On  Monday, Tussy  is going  up to  London 
for a theatrical performance  she is  taking part  in, after which  she  will 
come back here. 
By the time I left London, I had to pay out  SOMEWHAT  LESS  THAN  -£ 20 
of the  £40 you  gave  me on  unavoidable expenses. Here  my  lodgings 
cost me 2  GUINEAS  a week  and  with coal  and gas but  excluding other  EX­
TRAS,  ABOUT  £2 15s.; remaining weekly expenditure  ABOUT  4 GUINEAS. 
Considering  the  climatic performance this hole  has put up, it's a  tidy 
sum. Including travelling expenses,  I have spent  ABOUT  -£ 17 and  have 
still got £5.  This will  not  suffice  for the  last week (incl. Tussy's  INCI­
DENTAL  London  TRIP  and our  probable return together next week).  So 
I'd be grateful  if you could  let me  have  SOME£  by Monday  NEXT,  if it 
can be done. 
As for future plans,  the  first consideration must  be to  relieve Tussy 
of her role  as my  companion (when  I again  set forth  I shall  be able  to 
dispense with  an  escort altogether).  The  girl  is under such  MENTAL 
PRESSURE  that  it is  undermining  her  health. Neither travelling,  nor 
CHANGE  OF CLIMATE,  nor  PHYSICIANS CAN DO ANYTHING IN  THIS  CASE.  All one can 
do for her is to do as she  wishes,  and let her  take  a course  of theatrical 
LESSONS  with Madame Jung.  She has an  ardent desire  to open  up a ca­
reer for  herself,  or so she  imagines,  as an  independent, active artist 
and, once this  has  been conceded,  she is  undoubtedly right  in saying 
that,  at her age,  there's  no more time  to be  lost.  Not for  anything  in 
the world would  I have  the  girl think  she is to be  sacrificed  as an old 
man's 'nurse'  on the  altar  of family.  In fact,  I am  convinced that 
pro nunc' Madame Jung  is the  only doctor  for her. She is not  open 
for the  time being

with me; what I say is based on observation, not on her own state­
ments. Nor is the above assertion in any way incompatible with the 
fact that the most disquieting symptoms, which notably occur at 
night, are of an alarmingly hysterical nature, or so Miss Maitlanda 
told me (she spent 2 days here). But for this, too, no remedy is avail­
able just now save an absorbing and congenial pursuit. I have cer­
tain conjectures about her affairs of the 'heart', but that is too deli­
cate a subject to admit of discussion in black and white. 
I have had a letter from the Sorge family, 245 written by the old 
man, countersigned by Mrs Sorge and Sorge jun., b in which they 
invite me TO TURN OVER  A NEW LEAF, i. e. go and settle with them in 
New York. Well meant, at any rate! 
In the Arbeiterstimme in which C. Schramm, invoking  myself,  at­
tacked Karl Bürkli, 0 Bürkli now attacks Schramm, A for whose bene­
fit he demonstrates that everything he [Schramm] has adduced is 
quite beside the point since I nowhere consider the kind of money he, 
Bürkli, proposes, namely 'interest-bearing mortgage bank certificates'. 
Bürkli does, however, express surprise that I should make no mention 
of the Pole, August Cieszkowski [Du crédit et de la  circulation,  Paris, 
1839),  although in his  Système  des contradictions économiques  that 'rough 
diamond Proudhon' frequently, if respectfully, takes issue with Ciesz­
kowski (the 'prior inventor' of Bürkli's bank certificates). The said 
Cieszkowski — a count, as Bürkli,  NATIVE  of Switzerland, remarks, and 
a ['doctor  of philosophy' and 'Hegelian'] e INTO  THE  BARGAIN,  if not ac­
tually a  'fellow-countryman  of Marx', i.e. as 'deputy for Posen' in the 
'Prussian' National Assembly — the said count, etc., did in fact once 
call on me in Paris (at the time of the  Deutsch-Französische  Jahrbücher), 
and such was the impression he made on me that I neither wanted 
nor would have been able to read anything whatever of his contriv­
ing. Nevertheless, it's a notable fact that the inventors of 'real' credit 
money, which was meant to serve as a means of circulation at the 
same time, as opposed to what they call 'personal' credit money (e. g. 
present-day bank-notes), should have chanced their hand — albeit 
in vain — as far back as the founding of the Bank of England, and 
this in the interests and at the behest of the landed aristocracy/ At

all events, Bürkli is under a delusion as to the 'historical' date of 
birth of the Cieszkowskian 'idea', independently rediscovered by 
himself. 
What has struck me from the first about the Bismarck-William 
manifesto241 is the confusion as between Prussian king and German 
emperor! In the latter capacity, the laddie has, after all, no historical 
antecedents whatsoever, nor yet Hohenzollern traditions (on which 
a start has now been made with the 'Prince of Prussia's' ostentatious 
trip to England — to study the Constitution!246 ). After the nauseous 
protestations, expiring in submissive love, of your Mommsens, Rich­
ters, Hänels 247 et tutti  quanti,"  it was charming of Bismarck to play this 
card — however silly his manner of doing it. With any luck we shall 
yet see something happen.

Dear Emil, 
After sundry disturbances and unforeseen events, among which the 
eating and drinking that goes with the festive season, I have com­
posed myself sufficiently to send you, Lottchen, Elisabeth and her 
fiancé b my heartiest congratulations on their engagement. I would 
never have thought, when travelling to Manchester with August 
Erbslöh in the late autumn of 1842 248 (I've only seen him once or

twice since then in Barmen), that his son would marry a niece of 
mine. Admittedly, neither of the two young people had been so much 
as thought of at that time. It is a subject that lends itself to all kinds of 
suitable and unsuitable remarks — which, however, I shall refrain 
from making since anyone can easily do that for himself and the 
young couple will in any case be much too preoccupied with present 
and future to have time for utterly useless comments on a past that is 
antecedent to their births. 
Apart from that, I shall soon be moved to hope that engagements 
in our family, along with their more immediate and more remote 
consequences, will come at rather less frequent intervals, though ad­
mittedly in a family as numerous and prolific as ours these cases mul­
tiply proportionately to the square of the distance in time from a start­
ing-point that lies over 60 years behind us, and there's no going 
against a natural law such as that. 
I'm keeping quite well on the whole, except that I'm rather deaf 
in my left ear and regularly catch cold during the winter, but I got used 
to that years ago. At all events, the mild winter will help you shake off 
the effects of pneumonia, or at any rate alleviate them. Today it 
turned so warm again that I had to take my greatcoat off, despite a 
bit of SCOTCH MIST. 
Love to you all, especially to Lottchen and the happy couple.

that she can pay the RATES and still have something in hand. Next 
week, larger amounts will become available and then, after your re­
turn, we shall be able to make further plans. 
I'm very glad that you should feel strong enough to be able to 
travel alone in future. 
I skimmed through part of the Schramm-Bürkliade a and was 
greatly tickled by it. Even before 1842, Cieszkowski had already writ­
ten a book on natural philosophy (botany) b and, if I am not mis­
taken, also contributed to the Deutsche, if not actually the Hallische 
Jahrbücher." 
Our Parisian friends have reaped what they had sown. What we 
had both of us told them would happen has actually come to pass. 
They have, by their impatience, ruined what was a first-rate position 
which, if they were to have made the most of it, called precisely for 
discretion and the ability to wait and see. For Malon and Brousse had 
set a trap for them in true old Alliance style 6 ' — calumny in the form 
of mere hints, no open naming of names, and supplemented on the sly 
by word of mouth; they went straight into it like so many schoolboys 
(Lafargue in the van), inasmuch as they counterattacked by  name,  and 
were then dubbed disturbers of the peace. Moreover, their argument 
is so utterly puerile; as soon as one reads their opponents' retort, this 
leaps to the eye. Thus Guesde suppresses important qualificative pas­
sages of Joffrin's because they don't suit his book, and fails to mention 
the fact that, despite his opposition, the Comité national 25° declared 
Joffrin's programme to be  more radical  than the  programme  minimum,251 
thus giving Joffrin the party's blessing. A fact which he, of course, 
triumphantly parades before Guesde. d Then Lafargue words his ar­
ticles in such a way as to enable Malon to say in reply: 'But have we 
ever maintained that the struggles of the medieval communiers' 
against the feudal aristocracy were anything but class  struggles  — 
and do you, Mr Lafargue, contest this?' — And now we get jeremiad 
after jeremiad from Paris, saying that they have been hopelessly de­
feated and, at the next meeting of the Comité national, would even 
be set upon physically, and Guesde is as despairing as he was uppish 4 
weeks ago, and can see no salvation in anything short of secession by

the minority. And now, finding to their astonishment that they are 
having to lie on the bed they have made,— now they come to the 
laudable conclusion that they must eschew all personalities! 
I am sending you an old  Kölnische  Leitung which, however, contains 
a very interesting article on Russia. 252 
Incidentally, the factum (anti-Guesde) in the  Prolétaire,  written by 
Malon and Brousse and signed by Joffrin, is a splendid example of 
Bakuninist polemics and very much in the style of the 'Sonvillier cir­
cular', 253 but ruder. 
So the ukase has been issued re the reduction of vykup* pay­
ments. 254 Having regard to the colossal nedoimki,b the paltry per 
cent or two will, no doubt, make a great deal of difference! But every 
million it doesn't get makes a difference to the Russian Treasury. 
Bismarck, by the way, has had better luck than might have been 
expected: the Reichstag has endorsed his pilgrimage to Canossa by 
a 2/3 majority.255  But that would seem to be about the only thing 
upon which this Reichstag is able to agree. A fine majority: feudalists, 
ultramontanes, particularists, Poles, Danes, Alsatians, a few men of 
Progress, 256 demoscratchers and socialists! 
Ad vocemc  pilgrimages, this morning I met Furnivall wearing a blue 
ulster, belted at the waist, and a broad-brimmed hat — he looked 
exactly like a pilgrim going to the Holy Land on a quest for St Antho­
ny's beard.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN LONDON 
[Ventnor,] 15 January 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
BEST  THANKS FOR THE £ 20. 
I have resolved to leave tomorrow as the weather is getting pro­
gressively 'colder', which does my swollen cheek no good. So I shall 
lose only 2 days, and this will also save Tussy the double journey. 
Though repeatedly warned, our people in Paris have got them­
selves into a nice messa  (SERVES  Lafargue  AND  Guesde RIGHT) ; however, 
since they possess two papers, b they may, with a little ingenuity, 
nevertheless gain command of the field. 
I regard it as a major victory, not only in Germany itself but vis-
à-vis the outside world GENERALLY, that Bismarck should admit in the 
Reichstag that the German workers have to some extent 'given the 
thumbs down' to his state socialism. 257 London's rascally bourgeois 
press always sought to disseminate the opposite. 
I have received an extraordinarily kind letter from  OLD  Frankel 
from the 'state prison', ditto a letter from Wrôblewski who was  évidem­
ment' writing on behalf of his Polish party in Geneva 258; but in his 
haste he forgot to append not only the party's name but also his own. 
If, as Joffrin relates in his factum in the  Prolétaire*  he once staged a 
pro-Guesde demonstration  in London against the 'International' there, it 
was at all events such a platonic demonstration that no one knew 
anything about it apart from Joffrin himself and perhaps a few of his 
closest accomplices, i. e. it was carried out entirely in 'private'. 
Salut.

MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV7  2 
IN PARIS 
London, 23 January 1882 
41 Maitland Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Friend, 
I enclose a few lines for the Russian edition of the Communist 
Manifesto"; as these are to be translated into Russian they have not 
been polished to the degree that would be necessary if they were to be 
published  IN THE GERMAN VERNACULAR. 
I have only been back in London for a few days. For as a result of 
pleurisy and bronchitis, from which I had recovered, I was left with 
chronic bronchial catarrh which my doctorb hoped to clear up by 
sending me to Ventnor (Isle of Wight), a place that is usually warm, 
even in winter. On this occasion, however,—during the 3 weeks of 
my stay there — Ventnor was invaded by cold, wet, dull, misty 
weather while at the same time in London the weather turned almost 
summery, only to change again, however, on my return. 
The intention now is to send me somewhere in the south, possibly 
Algiers. It is a difficult choice, because Italy is barred to me (a man 
was arrested in Milan for having a name like mine); I can't even go 
from here to Gibraltar by STEAMER, as I have no passport and even the 
English demand a passport there. 
Despite all the urging on the part of doctors and those closest to 
me, I would never have agreed to such a time-wasting operation were 
it not for the fact that this accursed 'English' disease impairs one's in­
tellect. Moreover a relapse, even if I pulled through, would take up 
still more time. All the same I intend to carry out some further experi­
ments here first. 
*I send you a number of  Modern  Thought with an article on  myself 0; 
I need not tell you that the biographical notice of the author is alto­
gether wrong. My daughter — your correspondent Eleanor, who 
sends you her love — has in the copy forwarded to you taken upon 
herself to correct the English misquotations from the Capital. But

however badly Mr Bax — I hear he is quite a young man — may 
translate, he certainly is the first English critic who takes a real inter­
est in modern socialism. There is a sincerity of speech and a ring of 
true conviction about him which strike you. A certain John Rae—I 
think he is lecturer of Political Economy at some English Universi­
ty— has, some months ago, published in The  Contemporary  Review an 
article on the same subject," very superficial (though he affects to 
quote many of my writings he has evidently never seen), and full of 
that pretence of superiority which the true Briton is inspired with 
thanks to a peculiar gift of stolid blockheadedness. Still he tries hard 
to be so condescending as to suppose, that from conviction, and not 
from interested motives, I am, for almost 40 years, misleading the 
working class by unsound doctrines! Generally speaking, people here 
commence to yearn for some knowledge of socialism, nihilism, and so 
forth. Ireland and the United States on the one hand; on the other, 
the impending struggle between farmers and landlords, between agri­
cultural labourers and farmers, between capitalism and landlordism; 
some symptoms of revival among the industrial working class, as f. i. 
at some late partial elections for the House of Commons, where the 
official workingmen's candidates (especially the renegade of the 
International, miserable Howell259), proposed by the acknowledged 
leaders of Trades' Unions and publicly recommended by Mr Glad­
stone, 'the people's William' — were disdainfully rejected by the 
workmen; the demonstrative radical clubs forming in London, mostly 
composed of workmen, English and Irish intermingling, dead against 
the 'great liberal party', official trades-unionism, and the people's 
William, etc. etc.— all this induces the British philistine to want just 
now some information on Socialism. Unfortunately, the reviews, ma­
gazines, journals, etc., exploit this 'demand' only to 'offer' the public 
the expectorations of venal, ignorant, and sycophantic penny-a-liners 
(suppose even that they are shilling-a-liners). 
There appears a 'weekly', called The Radical, full of good aspira­
tions,  bold in language (the boldness is in the  sans gêne, h not in the vi­
gour),  trying to break through the trammels of the British press, but, 
with all that, of feeble performance. What the paper lacks, are intelli­
gent editors. Many months ago these people wrote to me, I was then 
at Eastbourne 160 with my dear wife, then at Paris,164 etc., so that 
they had not yet any interview with me. I consider it in fact useless.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 260 
IN ZURICH 
London, 25 January 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Not until today have I been able to get round to answering your 
letter of the 12th. Marx is home from the Isle of Wight with his 
youngest daughter,a  both considerably better, and Marx strong 
enough to go walking with me yesterday for 2 hours without a break. 
Since he isn't working yet and the Lafargues as often as not also drop 
in before dinner (i. e. 5 o'clock) when a bottle of good Pilsener is 
served up, my hours of daylight are usually frittered away and I have 
never liked writing by lamplight after the warning (chronic conjucti-
vitis) that was given to my left eye 3 years ago. 
Just now I happen to be at Marx's, so would you be so good as to 
thank Höchberg very much on Marx's behalf for his kind offer which, 
however, he is unlikely to be able to make use of; all that he knows for 
certain about his journey south is that he is  not going to the Riviera or 
to any part of Italy, if only on account of the police. The first proviso 
where convalescents are concerned is that there should be no harass-

ment by the police, in which respect Italy can hold put fewer guaran­
tees than anywhere else — save, of course, Bismarck's empire. 
We were greatly interested by what you told us of the goings-on 
among the 'leaders' in Germany. I have never made a secret of my 
opinion that the masses in Germany have been far better than their 
leaders, particularly since the press and agitation combined to turn 
the party into the latter's milch cow and butter purveyor, only to see 
the said cow abruptly slaughtered by Bismarck and the bourgeoi­
sie.  261 For the thousands instantly ruined thereby, it is a personal 
disaster not to have been placed in an immediately revolutionary si­
tuation, i. e. exile. Otherwise not a few who are now bemoaning their 
fate would have gone over to Most's camp or at any rate found the 
Sozialdemokrat far too moderate. The majority of our people re­
mained in Germany, as they needs must, for the most part going to fairly 
reactionary places, where they remained social outcasts dependent 
for their living on philistines and became, to a great extent, them­
selves tainted with philistinism. For them, everything soon began to 
turn on the hope that the Anti-Socialist Law would be repealed. 
Small wonder that, under pressure from the philistine establishment, 
some of them became obsessed with the idea — in reality an absurd 
one — that this could be attained by the exercise of moderation. Ger­
many is a truly infamous country for people without much will­
power. The narrowness and pettiness of prevailing conditions, both 
civil and political, the provincial character of even the cities, the 
petty but cumulative harassment in the running battle with police 
and bureaucracy — all this enervates instead of stimulating resist­
ance,  and in this way many of those in the 'great nursery' a grow child­
ish themselves. Petty conditions engender a petty outlook, so that 
a great deal of intelligence and vigour is called for if anyone living in 
Germany is to look beyond the immediate future, to keep his eyes 
fixed on the wider context of world events and not succumb to that 
complacent 'objectivity' that cannot see beyond its own nose and is 
therefore the most blinkered subjectivity, even though it be shared by 
a thousand other such fellow-subjects. 
True,  the emergence of such a tendency, cloaking its lack of insight 
and resolution under the mantle of 'objective' wisdom, is natural 
enough; nevertheless it must be ruthlessly combated. And for this the 
working masses themselves provide the best purchase. They alone in 
a A paraphrase from Heine's 'Zur Beruhigung'.

Germany live in anything approaching modern conditions, all their 
misfortunes, great and small, are attributable to the pressure exerted 
by capital and, whereas all other struggles in Germany, both social 
and political, are petty and paltry and revolve round paltry issues 
which have long been surmounted elsewhere, the workers' struggle 
alone is noble, it alone is abreast of the times, it alone does not ener­
vate the participants but is for them a constant source of fresh energy. 
So the more you are able to draw your correspondents from amongst 
the genuine workers,— not those who have become 'leaders' — the 
better will be your chance of counterbalancing the whines of the lead­
ership. 
This time it was inevitable that all manner of peculiar people 
should get into the Reichstag. All the more unfortunate, then, that 
Bebel should not have been elected.222 He alone is lucid, politically 
far-sighted and energetic enough to prevent blunders being commit­
ted. 
Could you not, after you  have done  with them, let us have for a week or 
two the 'stenographic reports' of debates" in which our deputies 
have played a serious part? I will vouch for their return. Newspaper 
reports, as we have often seen, simply cannot be relied on and none 
of the deputies, not even Liebknecht, could be induced to send 
us speeches that do them no honour.

More interruptions. Amongst others, little Hepner has been here, 
on his way to seek refuge in America, his purse and heart alike empty 
of content. A poor little chap in every respect, author of a well-
intentioned pamphlet on distraint, the law governing bills of ex­
change, the Jewish question and postal reform, dull as dull can be, all 
the old Jewish stuff he turned out 10 years ago,262 completely gone to 
rack and ruin; I almost felt like advising him to get baptised. Yet he 
provided me with the opportunity of finding out about the new im­
perial judicial code.263  It really is unutterably infamous! All the 
dirty tricks of Prussian law combined with all the infamies of the 
Code Napoléon, 264 and without any of the latter's better side. The

judge has freedom of decision in all spheres, being bound by nothing 
save — the Disciplinary Law which, in political cases, will undoubt­
edly, and indeed does, grant him power of 'discretion'. Thus — 
within the general German context — the judge inevitably becomes 
the executive official and tool of the police. Incidentally, here is a joke 
(originating no doubt from Windthorst) about Leonhardt, who is al­
leged to have said on his death-bed: 'Now I have avenged myself on 
Prussia; I've given it a legal system that's bound to bring it to its 
knees.' 
Bürkli's interest-bearing mortgage certificates, also supposed to re­
present money, go back much further than that thoroughly addle-
pated, old Hegelian Pole, Cieszkowski. a Similar schemes for the gene­
ral good of mankind had already been adumbrated as far back as the 
founding of the Bank of England. Since there is no mention whatever 
of credit in the first volume of  Capital  (apart from the conditions gov­
erning simple debt), credit money admits of consideration here only, 
if at all, in its very simplest form (token of value, etc.) and in relation 
to its lowliest monetary functions, while  interest-bearing  credit money 
does not admit of consideration at all. Hence Bürkli is right in telling 
Schramm that none of these passages in Capital apply to my particular 
monetary paper; and Schramm is right when he proves to Bürkli 
from Capital that he, Bürkli, hasn't the faintest idea of the nature and 
function of money. b This is not to say, however, that Bürkli's own 
particular monetary proposal is actually reduced to its own absur­
dity; that would require, besides general proof that this 'money' is in­
capable of fulfilling the most essential monetary functions, particular 
proof as to the functions which such paper might really be able to 
fulfil. Moreover, when Bürkli says, 'What concern have I with 
Marx? I stick to Cieszkowski' — the whole argument adduced by 
Schramm against Bürkli falls to the ground.— How fortunate that 
the Sozialdemokrat shouldn't have got mixed up in all this business! 
No doubt the whole hullabaloo will eventually die down of its own 
accord. 
That crises are one of the most powerful levers of political upheaval 
has already been pointed out in the  Communist  Manifesto and was ex­
pounded in the Neue Rheinische Leitung Review up to and including 
1848,  not without the rider, however, that a recurrence of prosperity 
will in turn hamstring the revolutions and pave the way for the

victory of reaction.  * Any detailed argument in support of this should 
take into consideration intermediate crises, some being of a more 
localised and some of a more specialised character; we are currently 
experiencing one such intermediate crisis which may be attributed 
entirely to swindle on the stock exchange; up till 1847 they were 
recurring middle terms, which is why, in my  Condition  of the Working 
Class,h the cycle is still shown as a five-year one. 
In France, there have been gross blunders on both sides. However, 
in the end Malon and Brousse, in their impatience to bring matters to 
a head and engineer the suspension of the Egalité (which is quite 
outside the competence of the Union Federative  265), have put them­
selves so clearly in the wrong that they are likely to suffer for it. Such 
bungling would be incomprehensible in cabalists as wily as Malon 
and Brousse, unless they felt that time was against them. For the Pro­
létaire  is said to be on its last legs and, if it expires, they will have no 
paper at all while the others will have two. c Hence the issue had to be 
decided while they still had a paper in which the resolutions -were 
published. The scurrilities and pure fabrications they are now dissem­
inating against Guesde, Lafargue, etc., and in particular Joffrin's 
concoction d — not concocted by him, however, but by Brousse and 
Malon — are altogether in the style of the old Bakuninist Alliance, 67 
and have awakened old memories in us. The Sozialdemokrat is abso­
lutely right not to get involved until things have cleared up a bit, 
which they will, I think, before very long. 
I had also meant to write to Kautsky about the Poles,224 but will 
have to drop that for today. Kindest regards, 
Yours,

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 140 
IN ZURICH 
London, 7 February J 882 
Dear Mr Kautsky, 
I have at last got round to answering your letter of 8 Novem­
ber.224 
One of the real tasks of the revolution of'48 (and the  real  as distinct 
from illusory tasks of a revolution are always carried out on the 
strength of that revolution) was the restoration of the oppressed and 
disunited nationalities of Central Europe in so far as these were at all 
viable and, in particular, ripe for independence. In the case of Italy, 
Hungary and Germany, this task was carried out by the executors of 
the revolution, Bonaparte, Cavour and Bismarck, in accordance with 
the circumstances obtaining at the time. There remained Ireland and 
Poland. Ireland need not be considered here; it is only very indirectly 
concerned with conditions on the Continent. But Poland lies in the 
middle of the Continent and keeping it partitioned is precisely the 
bond that continually re-cements the Holy Alliance  2 6 6 and hence 
Poland is of great interest to us. 
Now it is historically impossible for a great people to discuss this or 
that internal question in any way seriously so long as national in­
dependence is lacking. Prior to 1859 there was no question of social­
ism in Italy; even the republicans were few in number, although they 
constituted the most vigorous element. Not until 1861 did the repub­
licans begin to expand,267  subsequently yielding their best elements 
to the socialists. Similarly in Germany. Lassalle was on the point of 
giving up the cause for lost when he was lucky enough to be shot. It 
was not until 1866, the year that actually decided Little Germany's 
Greater Prussian unity, 268 that both the Lassallean and the so-called 
Eisenach parties2  6 9 acquired any significance, and it was not until 
1870,  when the Bonapartist urge to interfere had been eliminated for 
good, that the cause gathered momentum. If we still had the old Fe­
deral Diet  27°, where would our party be now? Similarly in Hungary. 
It wasn't until 1860 that it was drawn into the modern movement — 
sharp practice above, socialism below.271 
Generally speaking an international movement of the proletariat is 

=====第220页=====
192 112. Engels to Kautsky. 7 February 1882 
possible only as between independent nations. What little republican 
internationalism there was in the years 1830-48 was grouped round 
the France that was to liberate Europe, and  French chauvinism  was thus 
raised to such a pitch that we are still hampered at every turn by 
France's mission as universal liberator and hence by its natural right 
to take the lead (seen as a caricature in the case of the Blanquists but 
also much in evidence in that of e.g. Malon & Co.). In the Interna­
tional, too, the French not unnaturally took this view. They, and 
many others, had first to learn from events, and must still do so daily, 
that international co-operation is possible only among equals, and 
even  a. primus  inter  pares*  at most for immediate action. So long as Po­
land remains partitioned and subjugated, therefore, there can be no 
development either of a powerful socialist party within the country it­
self or of genuine international intercourse between Poles other than 
émigrés  and the rest of the proletarian parties in Germany, etc. Every 
Polish peasant and workman who rouses himself out of his stupor to 
participate in the common interest is confronted first of all with the 
fact of national subjugation; that is the first obstacle he encounters 
everywhere. Its removal is the prime requirement for any free and 
healthy development. Polish socialists who fail to put the liberation of 
the country at the forefront of their programme remind me of those 
German socialists who were reluctant to demand the immediate re­
peal of the Anti-Socialist Law ' 6 and freedom of association, assembly 
and the press. To be able to fight, you must first have a terrain, light, 
air and elbow-room. Otherwise you never get further than chit-chat. 
Whether, in this connection, a restoration of Poland is possible be­
fore the next revolution is of no significance. It is in no way our busi­
ness to restrain the efforts of the Poles to attain living conditions es­
sential to their further development, or to persuade them that, from 
the international standpoint, national independence is a very secon­
dary matter when it is in fact the basis of all international co­
operation. Besides, in 1873, Germany and Russia were on the brink of 
war272 and the restoration of  some  kind of Poland, the embryo of a la­
ter, real Poland, was therefore a strong possibility. And if these Rus­
sian gents don't soon put a stop to their pan-Slav intrigues and rab­
ble-rousing in Herzegovina,273 they may well find themselves with 
a war on their hands, a war neither they, nor Austria nor Bismarck 
will be able to control. The only people who are concerned that the 
first among equals 

=====第221页=====
112. Engels to Kautsky. 7 February 1882 193 
Herzegovina affair should take a serious turn are the Russian Pan-
Slav Party and the Tsar; no one can really concern himself with the 
rapacious Bosnian riff-raff any more than with the idiotic Austrian 
ministers and officials who are presently pursuing their activities 
there. So even without an uprising, as a result, rather, of purely Euro­
pean conflicts, the establishment of an independent Little Poland 
would be by no means impossible, just as the Prussian Little Ger­
many invented by the bourgeois owed its establishment not to the re­
volutionary or parliamentary methods they had dreamed of, but to 
war. 
Hence I am of the opinion that two nations in Europe are not only 
entitled but duty-bound to be national before they are inter­
national— Ireland and Poland. For the best way they can be inter­
national is by being well and truly national. That's what the Poles 
have understood in every crisis and proved on every revolutionary 
battleground. Deprive them of the prospect of restoring Poland, or 
persuade them that before long a new Poland will automatically fall 
into their laps, and their interest in the European revolution will be at 
an end. 
We, in particular, have absolutely no reason to impede the Poles in 
their necessary efforts to attain independence. In the first place they 
invented and put into practice in 1863 the methods of struggle which 
the Russians are now so successfully imitating (cf. Berlin und [St] 
Petersburg, Appendix 2) 274 and, in the second, they were the only 
reliable and capable military leaders in the Paris Commune.275 
Come to that, who are the people who oppose the Poles' national 
aspirations? First, the European bourgeoisie in whose eyes the Poles 
have been utterly discredited since the 1846 insurrection with its so­
cialist tendencies 276 and, secondly, the Russian pan-Slavs and those 
they have influenced, such as Proudhon, who saw this through Her-
zen's spectacles. But up till today few Russians, even the best of them, 
are free of pan-Slav tendencies and recollections; they take Russia's 
pan-Slav vocation for granted, just as the French do France's natural 
revolutionary initiative. In reality, however, pan-Slavism is an im­
posture, a bid for world hegemony under the cloak of a non-existent 
Slav nationality, and it is our and the Russians' worst enemy. That 
imposture will in due course disintegrate into the void, but in the 
meantime it could make things very awkward for us. A pan-Slav war, 
as the last sheet-anchor for Russian Tsardom and Russian reaction, is 
presently in preparation; whether it will actually materialise is a moot 

=====第222页=====
194 112. Engels to Kautsky. 7 February 1882 
point, but if it does there is one thing of which we may be certain, name­
ly that the splendid progress in the direction of revolution now be­
ing made in Germany, Austria and Russia itself  will be totally disrupt­
ed and forced into different and quite unpredictable channels. At 
best, this would set us back by 3-10 years; in all likelihood it would 
mean one last respite for a constitutional 'new era'277 in Germany 
and also, perhaps, Russia; a Little Poland under German hegemony, 
a war of retribution with France, renewed racial incitement and, fi­
nally, another Holy Alliance. Hence pan-Slavism is now more than 
ever our mortal enemy, despite — or perhaps just because of—its 
having one foot in the grave. For the Katkovs, Aksakovs, Ignatievs 
and Co. know that their empire will be gone for ever the moment 
Tsardom is overthrown and the stage taken by the Russian people. 
And hence this ardent desire for war at a moment when the treasury 
contains less than nothing and not a banker is willing to advance the 
Russian government so much as a penny. 
That is precisely why the pan-Slavs have a mortal hatred of the 
Poles.  Being the only anft'-pan-Slav Slavs, they are consequently 
traitors to the sacred cause of Slavdom and must be forcibly incorpo­
rated into the Great Slav Tsardom of which the future capital is 
Tsarigrad, i. e. Constantinople. 
Now you may perhaps ask me whether I have no feeling of sympa­
thy for the small Slav peoples and fragments thereof which have been 
split apart by those three wedges — the German, the Magyar and the 
Turkish — driven into the Slav domain? To tell the truth, damned 
little.  The Czecho-Slovak cry of distress: 
Bote! ... Ach nikdo neni na zemi 
Kdoby Slavûm (sic)  spravedlivost  cinil. ?i 
has been answered by Petersburg, and the entire Czech national 
movement cherishes the aspiration that the Tsar should  spravedlivost 
finitib them. The same applies to the others — Serbs, Bulgarians, Slo­
venes,  Galician Ruthenians (at least some of them). But these are aims 
of a kind we cannot support. Only when the collapse of Tsardom frees 
the national aspirations of these diminutive peoples from their entangle­
ment in pan-Slav hegemonic tendencies, only then can we let them

Slavs,  I am sure that six months of independence will suffice to bring 
them begging for re-admittance. But in no circumstances will these 
little nationalities be granted the right they are presently arrogating 
to themselves in Serbia, Bulgaria and East Rumelia — of preventing, 
that is, the extension of the European railway network to Constanti­
nople. 
Now as for the differences that have arisen between the Poles in 
Switzerland, these are émigré squabbles 224 such as are seldom of any 
consequence, least of all in the case of an emigration which will be cel­
ebrating its centenary in 3 years' time and which, owing to the urge 
felt by all émigrés to do, or at any rate plan, something, has given 
birth to plan after plan, one new so-called theory after another. But, 
as you will see from the foregoing, we are not of the same opinion as 
the RôwnoÈc  people and, indeed, we told them as much in a message 
sent on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of 29 November 1830, 
which was read out at the meeting in Geneva. a You will find a Polish 
version of it in the report (Sprawozdanie, etc.— Biblijoteka Rôwnosci: 
No. 1, Geneva, 1881), pp. 30 ff. The Rôwnoiï people have apparently 
allowed themselves to be impressed by the radical-sounding slogans 
of the Genevan Russians and are now anxious to prove that they are 
not open to the reproach of national chauvinism. This aberration, of 
which the causes are purely local and transitory, will blow over with­
out having any appreciable effect on Poland as such, and refuting it 
in detail would be more trouble than it was worth. 
How the Poles, by the way, will sort things out with the White and 
Little Russians and Lithuanians of the old Poland, or with the Ger­
mans as regards the frontier is, for the time being, no concern of  ours. 
Proof,  by the way, of how little the workers, even in allegedly 'op­
pressed' countries, are tainted by the pan-Slav yearnings of the aca­
demics and bourgeois is provided by the splendid accord between 
German and Czech workers in Bohemia. 
But enough for now. Kindest regards from 
Yours, 
F.E.

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER ' I3 
IN GENEVA 
London, 10 February 1882 
Dear Old Man, 
We had absolutely no idea that you were so seriously ill; all we 
knew was that you had been suffering from erysipelas and that's 
something that can be cleared up pretty easily. Had I had an inkling 
of how matters stood, I should have raised some money for you 
straight away, even though I myself was very short at the time and 
calls were being made on me from all sides. However, it's still not too 
late and I've therefore taken out a money order for you for four 
pounds = 100 frs 80 cts. of which you will doubtless have already 
been advised; because of an irregularity that cropped up here 
I wasn't able to write until today. 
Between ourselves, one might almost count it a blessing that Marx 
should have been so preoccupied with his own illness during his wife's 
last days as to prevent him being unduly preoccupied with his loss, 
both when it was impending and when it actually happened. Even 
though we had known for 6 months or more how matters stood, the 
event itself still came as a terribly hard blow. Marx left yesterday for 
the South of France278; where he will go from there won't be defi­
nitely decided until he gets to Paris. Under no circumstances will he 
make for Italy first; at the start of his convalescence even the possibil­
ity of harassment by the police must be avoided. 
We have thought about your proposal2  7 9 and take the view that 
the time has not yet come, though it soon will, to put it into effect. 
Firstly, a new, formally reorganised International in Germany, Au­
stria, Hungary, Italy and Spain would only give rise to fresh persecu­
tion and ultimately leave one with the choice either of giving the 
thing up, or of carrying on in  secret.  The latter option would be a ca­
lamity on account of the inevitable passion for coups and conspiracies 
and the no less inevitable admittance of  mouchards.*  Even in France 
the renewed application of the law banning the International, 280 
a informers 

=====第225页=====
113. Engels to Becker. 10 February 1882 197 
a law which has not been repealed — far from it — is by no means im­
possible.— Secondly, in view of the current wrangles between the 
Egalité and the Prolétaire, there's absolutely no counting on the 
French; we would have to declare ourselves for one party or the other 
and that, too, has its disadvantages. As individuals we are on the side 
of the Egalité, but shall take good care not to support them publicly 
just now after the succession of tactical blunders they have made, de­
spite our express warnings.— Thirdly, the English are proving more 
intractable than ever at present. For 5 whole months I tried, through 
The Labour Standard, for which I wrote leading articles, ' 6 3 to pick up 
the threads of the old Chartist movement and disseminate our ideas 
so as to see whether this might evoke some response. Absolutely noth­
ing, and since the editor,2 a well-meaning but feeble milksop, ended 
up by taking fright even at the Continental heresies I introduced into 
the paper, I called it a day.b 
Thus,  we should have been left with an International confined, 
apart from Belgium, exclusively to refugees, for with the possible ex­
ception of Geneva and its environs we couldn't even count on the 
Swiss —  vide  the Arbeiter stimme and Bürkli. c It would, however, hardly 
be worth the trouble to set up a mere refugee association. For the 
Dutch, Portuguese and Danes wouldn't really improve matters either 
and the less one has to do with Serbs and Romanians the better. 
On the other hand the International does indeed still exist. In so far 
as it can be effective, there is liaison between the revolutionary work­
ers of all countries. Every socialist journal is an international centre; 
from Geneva, Zurich, London, Paris, Brussels and Milan the threads 
run criss-cross in all directions and I honestly don't see how at this 
juncture the grouping of these small centres round a large main cen­
tre could give added strength to the movement — it would probably 
only lead to greater friction. But once the moment comes for us to 
concentrate our forces, it will, for that very reason, be the work of 
a moment, nor will any lengthy preparation be called for. The names 
of the pioneers in one country are known in all the others and a mani­
festo signed and supported by them all would make a tremendous im­
pact— something altogether different from the largely unknown 
names of the old General Council. But that is precisely why such a man­
ifesto should be saved up for the moment when it can really strike 
home, i. e. when events in Europe provoke it. Otherwise you will de-

tract from its future effect and will simply have put yourselves out for 
nothing. But such events are already taking shape in Russia where 
the avant-garde of the revolution will be going into battle. You 
should — or so we think — wait for this and its inevitable repercus­
sions on Germany, and then the moment will also have come for a big 
manifesto and the establishment of an official, formal International, 
which can, however, no longer be a propaganda association but sim­
ply an association for action. For that reason we are firmly of the opin­
ion that so splendid a weapon ought not to be dulled and blunted du­
ring the comparatively peaceful days on the very eve of the revolu­
tion. 
I believe that if you think the matter over again you will come 
round to our view. Meanwhile we both wish you a good and speedy 
recovery and hope to hear before long that you are quite all right 
again. 
Ever your old friend,

Rue de Cannebière 
DEAR FRED, 
I presume that Tussy dropped you a line yesterday. I had not origi­
nally intended to leave Paris until next Monday0; since my *state of 
health was rather not improving, I took at once the resolution of re-

moving  to Marseilles,  and  thence  at once,  on Saturday,  to sail for Al­
giers*.278 
In Paris, accompanied  by my Johnny,"  I called upon  but  one  mor­
tal, namely Mesa.  (In  fact he,  Mesa, sollicitierteb  me to  chatter  too 
much,  in addition  to which  I returned  to Argenteuil somewhat  too 
late,  ABOUT  7 O'CLOCK  IN THE  EVENING.  I didn't sleep a wink all night.) 
I tried  to persuade Mesa  to ask his  friends, notably Guesde,  if they 
would  be  kind enough  to postpone  a meeting with  me  until  my  return 
*from Algiers.  But all  that  in vain.  In fact, Guesde  is so  much  on all 
parts assailed just  now,  that  it was  important  for  him  to have  an 'offi­
cial' meeting  on my  side*. After  all,  one  was  bound  to concede that 
much  to the  party. Hence  I arranged  a meeting  at the Hôtel  de Lyon 
et de  Mulhouse,  8 boulevard Beaumarchais,  to which Guesde  and 
Deville came with Mesa  at ABOUT  5 in the  afternoon.  I first received 
them downstairs  in the  restaurant, having been accompanied there 
from Argenteuil  (on  Wednesday 0 afternoon)  by  Tussy  and  Jen­
nychen. Guesde  was  rather embarrassed  on Jennychen's account  BE­
CAUSE HE HAD JUST  [brought  out]  an acrimonious article against Lon­
guet,  ALTHOUGH SHE  (Jennychen)  DID NOT TAKE NO REGARD  WHATEVER  TO THAT 
INCIDENT.  As soon  as the young ladies  had  left, I d'abord A went  up to  ma 
chambre' with them, chatted there for  ABOUT  1 HOUR,  then  DOWN  — it be­
ing now  time  for  Mesa  to be  off—to  the  restaurant where they still 
had leisure  ENOUGH  to empty  a BOTTLE  of Beauve with  me.  By 7  o'clock 
they'd 'all' gone.  WITH  ALL  THAT,  although I was in bed by 9 o'clock, 
a fiendish  din of  traffic without intermission until  1 o'clock,  at which 
time  (ABOUT  1 O'CLOCK)  I had a vomissement? having again  got  too  much 
engrossed  in conversation. 
A fine  day for the  journey  to Marseilles,  and  ALL RIGHT  until just 
beyond  the  STATION  at Lyons. First,  l'/s  hours d'arrêfi  AT Cassis  on ac­
count  of the locomotive's  DISTEMPER;  then again  the  same mishap with 
the engine AT Valence, although this time  the  arrêt wasn't  so long. 
Meanwhile  it had  turned bitter cold with  a nasty  BITING WIND.  Instead 
of arriving some time before midnight,  we did not  reach [Marseilles] 
until after  2 o'clock  in the  morning;  to some extent  I was  MORE OR LESS 
FREEZING,  despite  all my  wrappings,  the  only antidote  I found being 
'alcohol' and I  AGAIN  AND  AGAIN  RESORTED  TO IT.  During the last quarter of

ties before obtaining possession  of one's  LUGGAGE. 
Today  it's  sunny  in Marseilles,  but the  wind itself  not yet  warm. 
Dr Dourlen advised  me to  stay  at the  above-named hotel, whence 
I shall leave  for  Algiers tomorrow (Saturday)  at 5 in the  afternoon. 
The office  of the Paquebots  à vapeur  des  Postes françaises'  is located 
here,  in the  very hotel  at which  I am  staying,  so that  I was  able  to take 
a ticket  (at 80 frs  FIRST CLASS)  for the  paquebot? Said straight away; 
one's  BAGGAGE  is likewise  ENREGISTERED  here,  so that everything  is as 
convenient  as can be. 
Apropos.  I [got]  hold  of a Prolétaire {L'Egalité  is also  SOLD  here). 
Lafargue seems  to me to be  constantly fomenting further  USELESS 
INCIDENTS  — though maybe  the  DETAILS  are  *far from exact.  As to his 
characterising Fourier  a 'Communist',  he is now  that they e make  fun 
of him obliged  to explain  in what sense  he might have called Fourier 
as a 'Communist'.* Such 'audacities'  may be  ignored, 'interpreted' 
or 'differently interpreted'; what  is worse  is that  SUCH  small  FACTS 
BE SAVED  at all. To my mind, he is far too long-winded. 
*My best compliments  to Laura;  I shall write  her  from Algiers. 
There  is one  single  man  sufficient  as patron;  it is a  long letter written 
by Longuet  to his  friend* Fermé,  who has  successfully made  his way

we had already reached Algiers by half past three in the morning on 
Monday (20 February).278 However, it was a chilly crossing and, 
though the ship was equipped with every comfort, the 2 nights were 
sleepless ones for me owing to the diabolical noise of the engines, 
wind, etc., which were disturbing in the cabin. 
Here again, I found in store for me the same quid pro  quo,  mutatis mu­

for Algiers, exceptionally cold and wet, while Nice and Menton are

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 24 
IN ZURICH 
London, 22 February 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I am answering your letter straight away, 1. because of the increas­
ing urgency of the pan-Slav business, and 2. because, now that Marx 
has left,278 I shall have to set seriously to work again and shall no 
longer have time for such lengthy dissertations. 
The 'short-hand reports'" will be returned today. Many thanks. 
Mostly rather dull, but I'm happy enough if it all passed off without 
any denial of principles or anything really discreditable happening. 
I should always be grateful if you could send me further con­
signments from time to time. I was much gratified to see that the 
shocking blunders perpetrated earlier in the Saxon Landtag had been 
retrieved.118  I imagine the Sozialdemokrat is quite satisfied with the 
result of its intervention. Signing the statement must have been a bit­
ter pill for Bios. 240 I am delighted that subscriptions should have pas­
sed the 4,000 mark and that the paper should find regular distribu­
tion in Germany, despite the police, etc. It is an  incredible  feat for 
a German paper that is  banned.  Before '48 such papers got in much 
more easily through having the support of the bourgeois and the 
booksellers, but no subscriptions were ever received. But in this case 
the workers actually pay — proof of their discipline and of the extent 
to which they live and have their being in the movement. I have no 
misgivings whatever about our German lads when things come to 
a head. They have stood the test splendidly on every occasion. And 
it's not they who are behaving like philistines but only their leaders 
who,  from the start, have been prompted by the masses, not the 
masses by them. 
That my letterb should have failed to convert you is quite under­
standable, since you were already in sympathy with the 'oppressed' 
southern Slavs. For after all, everyone of us, in so far as he has first 
gone through a liberal or radical phase, has emerged from it with 
these feelings of sympathy for all 'oppressed' nationalities, and I for

204 117. Engels to Bernstein. 22 and 25 February 1882 
one know how much time and study it took me to shake them  off— 
but then it was for good and all. 
Now, however, I must ask you not to ascribe to me opinions I have 
never expressed. I am in no way concerned with the official Austrian 
viewpoint represented for years by the Augsburg Allgemeine Leitung. 
Where it was right, it's out of date, and where it isn't out of date, it's 
wrong. I have absolutely no cause for complaint about the centrifugal 
movement in Austria. A 'bulwark against Russia' becomes superflu­
ous the moment revolution breaks out in Russia, i. e. when some sort 
of representative assembly meets. As from that day, Russia will be 
busy with its own affairs, pan-Slavism will collapse like the nonentity 
it is and the Empire will begin to crumble. Pan-Slavism is simply an 
artificial product of the 'educated classes', of the towns and universi­
ties, the army and the civil service; it is unknown in the country and 
even the landed aristocracy is in such a fix that it would execrate any 
kind of war. From 1815-59, cowardly and foolish though its policy 
may have been, Austria was indeed a bulwark against Russia. To af­
ford it yet another opportunity — now, on the eve of revolution in 
Russia — of setting itself up as a 'bulwark' would be tantamount to 
giving Austria a new lease of life, a new historical justification for its 
existence, and postponing the disintegration which inevitably awaits 
it. And in allowing the Slavs to come to power, Austria has, with true 
historical irony, itself declared that what has hitherto been its sole rai­
son d'être has ceased to exist. Come to that, a war with Russia would, 
within 24 hours, put paid to Slav domination in Austria. 
You say that, as soon as the Slav peoples (always excepting the 
Poles!) have no further grounds for looking to Russia as their only li­
berator, pan-Slavism will be checkmated. That's easily said and it 
sounds plausible. But in the first place the danger of pan-Slavism, in 
so far as it exists, does not lie at the periphery but at the centre, not in 
the Balkans but in the 80 million slaves upon whom Tsarism draws 
for its army and its finances. Hence it is there that the greatest effort 
must be made and, indeed, has  been  made. And is it to be blighted by 
a war? 
Again, I do not propose to go into the question of how the smaller 
Slav nations have come to look to the Tsar as their only liberator. Let 
it suffice that they do so; we cannot alter the fact and it will rest at 
that until Tsarism has been smashed; if there's a war, all these inter­
esting little nations will be on the side of Tsarism, the enemy of all 
bourgeois progress in the West. So long as this remains the case, I can 

=====第233页=====
117. Engels to Bernstein. 22 and 25 February 1882 205 
take no interest in their  immediate  liberation here and now; they are as 
much our declared enemies as their ally and patron, the Tsar. 
We must co-operate in the work of setting the West European pro­
letariat free and subordinate everything else to that goal. No matter 
how interesting the Balkan Slavs, etc., might be, the moment their 
desire for liberation clashes with the interests of the proletariat they 
can go hang for all I care. The Alsatians, too, are oppressed, and 
I shall be glad when we are once more quit of them. But if, on what is 
patently the very eve of a revolution, they were to try and provoke 
a war between France and Germany, once more goading on those 
two countries and thereby postponing the revolution, I should tell 
them: Hold hard! Surely you can have as much patience as the Euro­
pean proletariat. When they have liberated themselves, you will au­
tomatically be free; but till then, we shan't allow you to put a spoke in 
the wheel of the militant proletariat. The same applies to the Slavs. 
The victory of the proletariat will liberate them in reality and of ne­
cessity and not, like the Tsar, apparently and temporarily. And that's 
why they, who have hitherto not only failed to contribute anything to 
Europe and European progress, but have actually retarded it, should 
have at least as much patience as our proletarians. To stir up a gene­
ral war for the sake of a few Herzegovinians, which would cost a 
thousand times more lives than there are inhabitants in Herzegovina, 
isn't my idea of proletarian politics. 
And how does the Tsar 'liberate'? Ask the peasants of Little Russia 
whom Catherine liberated from 'Polish oppression' (pretext — 
religion) only to annex them later on. And what does all this Russian 
pan-Slav imposture amount to? The capture of Constantinople, 
that's all. Nothing else would act so powerfully on the religious tradi­
tions of the Russian peasant, inspire him to defend the holy city of 
Tsarigrad and give a new lease of life to Tsarism. And once the Rus­
sians are in Constantinople, farewell to Bulgarian and Serbian inde­
pendence and liberty—the little brothers [bratankï) would soon real­
ise how much better off they had been even under the Turks. It calls 
for the most colossal naivete on the part of the said bratanki for them 
to believe that the Tsar is out for their good rather than his own. 
You say that a Greater Serbia would be as good a bulwark against 
Russia as Austria. As I have already said, the 'bulwark' theory gene­
rally has ceased to hold any water for me since a revolutionary move­
ment gained strength in Russia. I have also said that I look forward 
with pleasure to Austria's disintegration. But this brings us to the 

=====第234页=====
206 117. Engels to Bernstein. 22 and 25 February 1882 
quality of these exiguous nations which is, after all, a consideration 
when it comes to sympathising with them. 
In 2-4 generations' time and after general European upheavals, 
Greater Serbia will certainly be feasible; today, having regard to the 
cultural level of its elements, it as certainly is not. 
1. The Serbs are divided into 3 denominations (the figures are taken 
from Safafik, Slovansky Nârodopis and are applicable to 1849): Greek 
Orthodox 2,880,000; Catholic, including the so-called Croats who, 
however, speak Serbian, 2,664,000, minus the Croats, 1,884,000; 
Mohammedans 550,000. Where these people are concerned, religion 
actually counts for more than nationality, and it is the aim of each deno­
mination to predominate. So long as there's no cultural advance such 
as would at any rate make toleration possible, a Greater Serbia would 
only spell civil war. See enclosed Standard. 
2. The country has 3 political centres — Belgrade, Montenegro, 
Agram. Neither the Croats nor the Montenegrins wish to submit to 
the supremacy of Belgrade. On the contrary. The Montenegrins and 
your friends, the aborigines in Krivosije and Herzegovina, would up­
hold their 'independence' vis-à-vis Belgrade or any other central gov­
ernment— Serbian or otherwise—just as much as they would vis-
à-vis the Turks or the Austrians. That independence consists in 
demonstrating their hatred of the oppressor by stealing cattle and other 
valuable chattels from their own 'oppressed' Serb compatriots as they 
have done for the past 1,000 years, and any attack on their right of 
rapine is regarded as an attack on their independence. I am enough 
of an authoritarian to regard the existence of such aborigines in the 
heart of Europe as an anachronism. And even if these little folk had 
had a standing as high as Sir Walter Scott's vaunted Highlanders, 
who were also really shocking cattle thieves, the most we could do is 
condemn the  manner  in which they are treated by present-day society. 
If we were at the helm, we too should have to put an end to the 
Rinaldo Rinaldini-Schinderhannes business which, by long tradition, 
these laddies indulge in. And so would the government of Greater 
Serbia. Here too, then, Greater Serbia would mean a revival of the 
struggle now being conducted by the Herzegovinians, and hence civil 
war involving all the highlanders of Montenegro, Cattaro and Herze­
govina. 
On closer consideration, then, Greater Serbia does not appear 
anything like as simple and straightforward a matter as pan-Slavs 
and liberals à la Rasch would have us believe. 

=====第235页=====
117. Engels to Bernstein. 22 and 25 February 1882 207 
Well, go on sympathising with these aborigines as much as you 
like; there's certainly no denying them a sort of poetic radiance and, 
in fact, they do still produce folk songs that closely resemble the old 
Serbian ones (which are very fine); I shall even send you an article 
from The Standard by way of  proof.  But the fact remains that they are 
the tools of Tsardom, and there's no room in politics for poetical feel­
ings of sympathy. And if the rebellion of these laddies threatens to 
unleash a general war that would make a complete hash of our revo­
lutionary situation, they and their right of cattle stealing will have to 
be mercilessly sacrificed to the interests of the European proletariat. 
Come to that, if Greater Serbia were to materialise it would only 
be an enlarged version of the principality of Serbia. And what has the 
latter achieved? Set up an educated bureaucracy on the Austrian mo­
del, consisting of chaps from Belgrade and other towns who have 
been to university in the West, particularly Vienna, and, knowing 
nothing of the conditions governing communal ownership among the 
peasants, make laws after the Austrian pattern that fly in the face of 
those conditions so that masses of peasants are impoverished and ex­
propriated, whereas in the days of the Turks they enjoyed full auton­
omy, grew rich and paid fewer taxes. 
The Bulgarians have depicted themselves in their folk songs, a col­
lection of which, made by a Frenchman, has recently appeared in 
Paris. a Fire plays a major role here. A house burns down, the young 
woman is burnt to death because, instead of his wife, her husband 
chooses to save his black mare. Another time a young woman saves 
her jewellery and leaves her child to burn. If, by way of exception, 
there is a noble and courageous act, it is invariably performed by 
a Turk. In what other part of the world would you find such a beastly 
lot? 
Incidentally, if you take a look at a passable philological map of the 
district (e. g. Safarik's, in the above-mentioned book, or Kiepert's of 
Austria and the countries of the Lower Danube 1867b) you will find 
that the liberation of these Balkan Slavs is not an altogether simple af­
fair and that, with the exception of Serbian territory, there are pock­
ets of Turks all over the place, and a Greek fringe along the coast, not 
to mention Salonika which is a Spanish Jewish town. True, the wort­
hy Bulgarians are now rapidly dealing with the Turks in Bulga-

ria and East Rumelia by slaughtering them, driving them out and 
burning down their houses over their heads. Had the Turks adopted 
the same course, instead of allowing them more autonomy and fewer 
taxes than they have at present, the world would no longer be troub­
led with a Bulgarian question. 
As regards war, you would seem to me to have le coeur un peu trop  lé­
ger.*  If war breaks out, it will be easy for Bismarck to make it look as 
though Russia were the aggressor: he can wait, but the Russian pan-
Slavs can't. But Germany and Austria once committed in the 
East, one would have to be a poor judge of Frenchmen, and particu­
larly Parisians, not to anticipate that there would instantly arise 
a chauvinistic clamour for retribution which would reduce to silence 
the peaceful majority of the people and cause France to appear yet 
again as the aggressor; or that the chauvinism then prevailing would 
very soon demand the left bank of the Rhine. That this would soon 
involve Germany in a struggle for survival so that there, too, patriotic 
chauvinism would completely regain the upper hand, seems to me 
self-evident. So far, all the prospects are against us. But once a war is 
under way, there is no knowing what will be the outcome of  this,  the 
first such European conflict since 1813-15, and I would be the last 
man to wish for it. If it does come, however, then it can't be helped. 
But now for the other side of the coin. In Germany we have a situa­
tion that is drifting ever more rapidly towards revolution and must 
before long push our party to the fore. We ourselves needn't lift a fin­
ger, just let our opponents do the work for us. On top of which a new 
era277 is impending with a new, liberalising, highly irresolute and 
wavering Emperor,b who is exactly cut out to be a Louis XVI. All 
that is wanting is a timely impulse from without. This will be afforded 
by the situation in Russia where the onset of the revolution is only 
a question of months. Our people in Russia have virtually taken the 
Tsar prisoner,281 have disorganised the government and shattered 
popular tradition. Even without any other major coup, a collapse 
must ensue in the very near future, and the process will go on for 
years,  as it did between 1789 and '94. Hence it will allow ample time 
for repercussions in the West, more notably Germany, so that the 
movement will gradually gather momentum, unlike 1848, when 
reaction was already in full swing throughout Europe by 20 March. 
Never, in short, has there been so magnificent a revolutionary situa-
to be a bit too light-hearted-b William II

tion. Only one thing can spoil it: as Skobelev himself said in Paris, 
only war with another country could get Russia out of the morass 
into which it is sinking.282  That war would repair all the damage our 
people, at the cost of their lives, have done to Tsarism. It would be 
enough at any rate to rescue the Tsar from his captivity, to expose the 
social revolutionaries to the general fury of the mob, to deprive them 
of the support they now get from the Liberals and undo all they have 
achieved by their sacrifices; everything would have to be begun all 
over again under less favourable circumstances. But a play of this 
kind scarcely admits of a second performance and even in Germany — 
upon that you may depend — our people will either have to join in 
the patriotic ululations, or draw down upon their heads a furore by 
comparison with which the one that followed the assassination at­
tempts ' 20 was mere child's play; and Bismarck's riposte to the recent 
elections would be of quite a different order from the one he made 
then with his Anti-Socialist Law.16 
If peace is maintained, the Russian pan-Slavs will be bilked and 
will soon have to retreat. Whereupon the Emperor* can at most 
try one last throw with the old bankrupt bureaucrats and gene­
rals who have already once been on the rocks. That could last for 
a month or two at the outside, after which there would be no recourse 
save to call on the Liberals —  i. e. a National Assembly of some kind 
and that, if I know my Russia, would mean revolution à la 1789. 
And then you go and suggest I want war! Not on your life, even if it 
means the demise of 200 noble robber nations. 
But enough of that. And now for Bürkli. I haven't read his pam­
phlet  b and have mislaid it, but shall look and see if I can find it in 
Marx's house or mine. So I can't say exactly what he is after. 
(25 February) 
I have just been hunting high and low at Marx's and couldn't find 
it. With our division of labour, specialised questions of this kind fall to 
Marx's share and, because of  his illness, we haven't even been able to 
discuss the matter. 
I assume that Bürkli permits every Zurich real property owner to 
take out a mortgage of this kind on his property, and that the rele-

vant certificate is supposed to circulate as money. In this way the 
amount of money in circulation is dictated by the amount which the 
real property in question is worth, and not by the far smaller amount 
that would suffice for circulation. So even at this stage: 
1. Either they are non-redeemable certificates, in which case they 
depreciate in accordance with the law expounded by Marx283; 
2. Or they are redeemable, in which case the portion over and 
above what is needed for circulation returns to the bank for redemp­
tion and ceases to be money, which, of course, means that the bank 
must, tie up capital. 
Now a substitute for money which is interest-bearing and of which, 
therefore, the value fluctuates day by day is, if only for that reason, an 
unsuitable means of circulation; not only does one first have to agree 
the price of the commodity in real money, but also the price of the pa­
per. The people of Zurich would have to be worse businessmen than 
I suppose if, the certificates being redeemable, they didn't all 
promptly surrender them to the bank for redemption, and go back to 
using only the old, convenient, non-interest-bearing money. Which 
means that the cantonal bank would have tied up in mortgages its 
own capital as well as everything it could borrow and would have to 
cast round for new sources of working capital. 
But, if non-redeemable, they simply cease to be money. Metallic 
or good paper money is drawn from the outside world which, luckily, 
is a little bit larger than the Canton of Zurich, and that's what people 
use, for no one will accept these dreary certificates as money and in 
that case they are, as you rightly say, no better than Brandenburg 
mortgage bonds. And if the government insists on forcing the public 
to accept them as money, it is in for a surprise. 
This between ourselves; if you make use of  it, please don't mention 
my name since, as I have said, I have not read the little pamphlet or 
had time to read up the subject in the classic economic texts; but if 
one tries to criticise such things out of one's head, just like that, there's 
no guaranteeing that one won't make blunders. At all events, the 
thing is nonsensical.

My Dear Friend, 
The Financial Reform Almanack 1882 gives the following addresses: 
Dilke, W. Ashton, 1 Hyde Park Gate, S. W. 
Ditto Sir Charles, 76 Sloane St, S. W. 
When I got home from your place I found a letter from Dr Donkin 
(the one who treated Hartmann some time ago, and also the Marx 
family) in which he says: 
* 'I had a letter from Hartmann a few days ago (dating from 14 Huntley St, 
Bedford Sq.) asking me if he might come and see me. I answered his letter directly — 
giving him the choice of two days — but have heard nothing of him. 
'In case my letters have miscarried will you tell me if you know anything about 
him. If you see him perhaps you will tell him that I will see him any morning here 
(60 Upper Berkeley St., W.) between 11 and 12 o'clock.'* 
Would you be so kind as to pass on the preceding lines to Hartmann? 
Since Donkin's letter failed to arrive, I fear there may be some mistake 
as to the  number,  of which I am not sure, since I know of it only from 
Donkin. Hence it is impossible for me to communicate with Hartmann 
direct or with any certainty, and that is why I am asking you to act as 
intermediary, the more so since you say it is quite close to your place.

could you let me have some further information concerning this mat­
ter on Sunday evening?

DEAR FRED, 
The telegram 284 I sent you anticipated my POSTCARD/ as the latter 
would have caused somewhat unnecessary anxiety. The fact is that 
thanks to an accumulation of unfavourable circumstances of a petty 
nature (incl. the sea crossing), I have been frozen to the marrow, my 
corpus  delicti* having landed at Algiers on 20 February. 
December was an atrocious month in Algiers, January fine, Febru­
ary cold when not also damp. I struck the 3 coldest days of the said 
last month, the 20th, 21st and 22nd of February. No sleep, no appe­
tite, a bad cough, somewhat perplexed, not without an occasional 
bout of profunda  melancolia,  like the great Don Quixote. AT  ONCE  THEN 
back to Europe, no go, what with the faux frais," on top of which the 
prospect of another 2 nights in one of the  cabines,  one's brain tortured 
by the racket from the engines! Or again, certain escape from the quid 
pro quo d by setting off at once for Biskra, right next to the Sahara 
Desert? But difficult, considering the fact that the means of communi­
cation or transport demand a further journey of  7 to 8 days and, ac­
cording to the advice of someone familiar with the conditions, no 
small undertaking for a  pro nunce invalid in view of possible INCIDENTS 
before arrival in Biskra! 
Anyway, as the thermometer on the après-midi' of 22 February indi­
cated fair weather and I had already spied out the Hôtel-Pension

that in the  villa  I have  up  till now  simply replaced  the  rhinoceros

Your letter dated  25  February  284  arrived yesterday together with

she is subjected  to a  great deal  of physical exertion.  As yet no

Hôtel Victoria 
(Go on writing to me here, 
aux soins de a Fermé) 
My Dear Child, 
After receiving your letter  through  Fermé, I sent a messenger to the 
Hôtel d'Orient to make inquiries there as well; he was handed a letter 
for me from you dated 24 February. 
I shall now give you a short account of the state of my health. 
Since my cough had become more persistent, with severe expecto­
ration, insomnia, etc., I sent for Dr Stephann (who also looks after 
some of my other fellow-lodgers) and have thus been under his care 
since 26  February  when he first examined me. He is a very shrewd and 
determined man. He found that, as a result of the unfortunate conca­
tenation of events from the time I left Paris until now, my left side, 
which had been weakened by pleurisy, was functioning abnormally. 
The chief antidote consists in  vésicatoires h (the drawing off of fluid by 
painting the left side of my back and the lefthand side of my chest 
with cantharidic collodion) which works well in my case, and also 
a 'soothing' cough mixture; lastly, an arsenical preparation (as taste­
less as water) to be taken after every meal. In so far as  the weather permit­
ted, I was to continue taking a gentle stroll each morning. 
Unfortunately (had the weather been more favourable, my violent

coughing would [undoubtedly]a  have gone of its own accord) I be­
gan to spit blood on 6 March but, after 8 and 9 March, had a really 
serious [haemorrhage] with some residual pain until the 12th, and on 
the 13th all  trace  of haemorrhage  had  gone.  So this disagreeable episode 
lasted a week; Dr Stephann intervened energetically, forbidding all 
movement (walks, needless to say)  ; likewise ALMOST all TALK; hot foot­
baths,  etc., along with drastic medicaments. During this time the 
treatment with  vésicatoires,  cough TONICS, etc., continued and did, in 
fact, reduce the coughing quite amazingly. Also, the weather has gra­
dually begun to change although not yet ALTOGETHER  comme  il faut. h 
From my hill-top villa (Hôtel Victoria) I have before me the prospect 
of the bay and, to one side, villas rising in an amphitheatre —, [finest 
air], a even without a stroll, [wafting] past the little balcony in front 
of my own and the adjoining  chambres,'  or again in the verandah, the 
latter giving access to the first floor. The doctor will not permit me to 
resume my strolls until he has again examined the  corpus  delictis Be it 
noted that latterly not only have I regained my appetite, but have at 
last managed to  snatch some  sleep.  (From the 16th of February, IN  FACT 
SINCE  THE  NIGHT  IN THE hôtel in Paris, I had suffered from insomnia unre­
mittingly until the moment referred to above.) 
* Take now all in all, the upshot is, as I too reported to London/ 
that in this foolish, ill-calculated expedition, I am now just arrived 
again at that standard of health when I possessed it on leaving Mait-
land Park.1 I must, however, say that many visitors here too passed, 
and are passing still through the same trial. Since 10 years Alger had 
not such a failure of the winter season. Myself had had some doubts; 
there was the experience of the Isle of Wight234  and other corners, 
but Engels and Donkin fired each other mutually into African furor, 
neither one nor the other getting any special information, considering 
that in regard to temperature this year was extraordinary. I had now 
and again by innuendo given to understand to begin at least by Men-
tone (or Nizza) as Lavrov had received from Russian friends very fa­
vourable news, but all this was ruled down by my sanguine good old 
Fred g who, I repeat it, I say it amongst you and  myself,  may easily 
kill some one out of love. 
I must tell you that in this Villa-Hôtel, the two ladies, its mana­
gers,  did everything in my service, no care nor attention neglecting.

again. [It is] hardly likely that I shall be able to leave this place be­
fore the month is out, for I must firstly complete the full course of 
treatment prescribed by Dr Stephann, and not till then (always sup­
posing that ALL  THEN  AS TO WEATHER ALTOGETHER SETTLED) shall I actually be 
able to commence the actual fresh air treatment. 
I have seen nothing of the Justice (polemic with  Citoyen) , nor indeed 
any of the Paris papers save for the Egalité. I was very pleased to learn 
from your letter that Tussy had found a tactful solution to the cata­
strophe. 285 If and when Lissagaray launches his Bataille, you will, I 
presume, send me the early numbers; *I do not believe in

once an end to this, making him understood that I was an invalid.* 
But he meant very well, and now he knows rest, SOLITUDE and

MARX TO PAUL LAFARGUE286 
IN PARIS 
[Algiers,] Monday, 20 March [1882] 
My dear Paul, 
Your kind letter of 16 March was delivered to me today (20th) so 
that it seems to have taken far less time to get here than is usual for 
letters from London. 
First of all, my gallant Gascon, 'what does Mustapha supérieur" 
refer to?' Mustapha is a proper name like John. If you leave Algiers 
by the rue dTsly, you see a long street in front of you. On one side of 
it, in the foothills, rise Mauretanian villas surrounded by gardens 
(one of these villas is the Hôtel Victoria); on the other side — along 
the road — houses are spread out in descending terraces. All of this 
together is called Mustapha supérieur: Mustapha inférieur b begins at 
the incline of Mustapha supérieur and stretches down to the sea. Both 
Mustaphas form a single commune (Mustapha) whose mayor (this 
gentleman bears neither an Arab nor a French name but a German 
one) communicates with the inhabitants from time to time by means 
of official notices — a very soft regime, as you see. New houses are 
constantly being constructed in Mustapha supérieur, old ones are be­
ing demolished, etc., but although the workers engaged in this acti­
vity are healthy people and local residents they go down with fever 
after the first three days. Part of their wages, therefore, consists of a 
daily dose of quinine supplied by the employers. The same practice 
can be observed in various places in South America. 
My dear augur. You are so well informed that you write: 'You 
must be consuming all the French newspapers that are sold in Al­
giers';  in actual fact I don't even read the few newspapers which the 
other hotel residents in the Victoria receive from Paris; my political 
reading is entirely limited to the telegraphic announcements in the 
Petit Colon (a small Algerian paper similar to the Parisian Petit-
Journal, the Petite République  Française,  etc.). That's all. 
Jenny wrote that she was sending Longuet's articles which you 
a Upper Mustapha - b Lower Mustapha 

=====第249页=====

mention too, but I still haven't received them. The only newspaper 
that I receive from London is U Egalité, although you can't call it 
a newspaper. 
What a strange fellow you are, St Paul! Where did you get the idea 
or who told you that I should 'rub my skin with iodine? You will 
interrupt me and say that this is a mere trifle, but it does reveal your 
method of the 'material fact'. Ex ungue leonems In reality, instead of 
'rubbing my skin with iodine' I have to have my back painted with 
cantharidic collodion to draw out the fluid. The first time I saw my 
left side (chest and back) treated in this manner, it reminded me of 
a kitchen garden in miniature planted with melons. Since 16 March 
when I wrote to Engels 284 there has not been a single dry place either 
on my back or my chest (the latter is also being treated) on which the 
operation could be repeated; this cannot happen now before the 
22nd. 
You say: 'A letter of invitation is enclosed which will make you 
laugh.' Es regular.''  But how do you expect me to laugh when the 'en­
closed' letter is still in your hands? When the opportunity arises, 
I shall remind Mr Fermé of his former comrade—the Proudhonist 
Lafargue. At present, while Doctor 1 forbids me to go out, I am using 
the time to refuse frequent visits and prolonged conversations. 
The rains continue as before. The climate is so capricious; the 
weather changes from one hour to the next, going through every 
phase or suddenly leaping from one extreme to the other. However, 
there are signs of gradual improvement, but we shall have to wait. 
And just to think that from the moment of my departure for Marseil­
les and right up to the present there has been the finest weather in 
both Nice and Menton! But there was this insistent idea — for which 
I was not responsible — of the African sun and the wonder-working 
air out here! 
Last Saturday we buried one of the residents of the Victoria, by the 
name of Armand Magnadère, in Mustapha supérieur; he was quite a 
young man sent here by Parisian doctors. He worked in 
a Paris bank; his employers continued to pay his salary in Algiers. To 
please his mother they arranged by telegraph to have his body exhu­
med and sent to Paris — all at their expense. Such generosity is sel­
dom met with even among people charged with 'other people's 
money'.

[Algiers,] Monday, 27 March 1882 
My Dear Child, 
I received your letter to-day (27 March); you know how delighted 
I am always to hear of you. My reports to you did not conceal the 
worst from you; so you may also feel quite sure that I simply tell the 
truth in announcing you that since the date of my last letter to youb 
my state of health is progressively improving. There is no longer in-
somny (the worst of  all),  nor want of appetite, nor any violent charac­
ter of cough, the latter indeed much subdued. Of course the  vésicatoi-

res'' can, because of their intense action, only once a week be renewed; 
so the process of the healing of the membranes (the essential tissue of 
the organ has not at all suffered) on the left side wants some time. Of 
course the most unsteady weather, with sudden changes, storms, 
heats,  colds, rain, in fact only a few good intervals,— the steady seas­
onable  air warm and 'sec'b  is still the great desideratum. When we just, 
like yesterday, had caught the decisive turning point — it was 
a beautiful day, and I had a promenade,— but to-day sky grey (with 
a nuance  noirâtre'), rain pouring down, wind howling. People here get 
it quite tired, for, it must not again and again be repeated: this such 
weather since December (inclus.) quite anormous in Algier. The 
thing was to inform oneself before starting on such a chasse  aux oies sau­
vages. A 
Entre nousc : Though in the Isle of Wight 234 the weather was un­
favourable, but still my health improved so greatly that people won­
dered when myself returning to London. But, then, I had tranquillity 
at Ventnor; at London, on the contrary, Engels' excitement (La-
fargue, too, a quack, thought 'walking', free air etc. were all I did 
want) in fact has upset me: I felt, I could not longer stand it; hence 
my impatience to get from London away on any condition whatever! 
People may kill some one out of real most sincere love; with all that 
nothing more dangerous in such cases for a reconvalescent! 
As I told you/ dear child, I have had the good chance of having 
met with well-meaning, kind and unpretending people (French-Swiss 
and unmixed French, no German nor English in my Villa-Hôtel). 
Mr Maurice Casthelaz functions as volunteer under the orders of 
Dr Stephann; no Nym E more careful or attentive. Hence, my child, 
do not worry yourself as to my fancied helpless situation. Enough of 
male and female helps; and, on the other hand, it is the privilege of a 
'patient' to be silent, to withdraw, etc., whenever I prefer the solitude 
or take no notice of the company. 
Generally I have altogether neglected the French, English etc. 
daily press; I read only the telegraphic news. What I had desired, f. i., 
was Longuet's articles on the grève* (Lafargue wrote me greatly 
praising those articles). As to Massard's sottise,' I know to that mo­
ment nothing save what you have written me.

[Algiers, 28-] 31 March 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
28 March: A maddeningly wet day early this morning — when I fin­
ished writing a short epistle to Tussy.284 This had already gone off, 
however, when a storm developed which, for the first time, put on 
a good performance; not only howling wind, torrents of rain and 
thunder, but incessant lightning INTO THE  BARGAIN.  This went on until 
late at night, accompanied as usual by a considerable drop in tempe­
rature. Interesting, the varying colours of the waves in the lovely, 
almost elliptical bay; the surf snowy white, and the sea beyond 
changing from blue to green.

29 March (Wednesday)  : Maddening drizzle today; no less madden­
ing the moaning gusts of wind; temperature, cold and damp. 
Today, shortly before  déjeuner*  (takes place at a QUARTER  PAST  or per­
haps half past 11) Dr Stephann arrived for the specific purpose of'de­
voting' himself to the painting of those places at the very bottom of 
my back and chest he had specially signalled out and reserved for his 
own attack. Beforehand, as on every visit, a thorough examination; 
by far the largest part of my left side was accorded much better STATUS; 
the aforementioned  nethermost  spots, presently giving forth no more 
than a low murmur in place of Helmholtz's musical note, can only be 
put to rights by slow degrees (anything speedier being hampered by 
the bad weather). Today, for the first time,— no doubt because he 
thought me far enough on the road to recovery for him to speak his 
mind — Stephann told me that I had already suffered a rechute^ of 
a most serious kind by the time I arrived in Algiers. The  épanchements c 
could only be controlled by recourse to  vésicatoires, d and I had made 
better progress than might have been foreseen. He added, however, 
that I should have to treat myself very carefully for years. When 
I leave Algiers, he will give me a written diagnosis — intended in par­
ticular for my London doctor/ People of my age, he said, should be 
careful not to experiment too often with  rechutes.  A few hours after 
déjeuner  the tableau r on my skin began to come to life in grim earnest; 
like someone who feels his epidermis has contracted and he himself is 
seeking to burst out of it; agony all night long; I had been absolutely 
forbidden to scratch. 
30 March: At 8 o'clock in the morning my ASSISTANT-DOCTOR, my help­
mate," appeared at my bedside. It transpired that, as a result of spon­
taneous movements, the blisters  GENERALLY  had burst; a veritable flood 
had taken place during the night — linen, flannel, night-shirt soaked. 
So the painting had had the  desired  effect on  the places under  attack. My 
kind HELP at once proceeded to bandage me, not only so as to prevent 
the flannel's rubbing, but also to draw off what remained of the fluid. 
This morning (31 March) Mr Casthelaz discovered that the SUCTION 
was at last nearing its end and the process of drying-out almost 
complete. This being so, I shall probably be able to undergo a second 
application within the same week (beginning 29 March). Tant mieux}

30 March (yesterday), the weather turned nice and warm at about 
midday, for which reason I strolled out onto the balcony; later I slept 
a little to make up for the restless night, as I shall also do today, since 
the strict avoidance of scratching keeps one awake at night even 
though, as during the night of 30 to 31, it's not agonising. 
Weather today (31 March) uncertain; no rain yet, at all events; 
might turn relatively 'fine' towards midday, as it did yesterday. 
There's nothing further to add to the health bulletin; quite satisfac­
tory on the whole. 
Have received [a letter] from Tussychen today. 
Apropos, a short while ago she sent me the enclosed letter; I can't 
make out the signature; you will be able to. At all events a strange 
phenomenon, a Quedlinburg lawyer with a Weltanschauung of his 
own! But one thing I can't make out: Has the copy of the chap's 
'book' intended for me arrived at Maitland Park, a or does he want to 
have my exact address first so as to ensure that his book gets there 
safely? If the first, Tussy should acknowledge receipt of his book, if the 
second, send him my 'safe' address. 
Mon cher,h  like other  FAMILY  MEMBERS,  you, too, will have been struck 
by my mistakes in spelling and syntax, and bad grammar; I never re­
call these — my absent-mindedness being still very great — until after 
the event.  SHOWS  YOU there's something in the saying sana  mens  in sano 
corpore."  No doubt this will mend itself  BY AND  BY. 
The tocsin  pour déjeuner d has just sounded and this little note must 
accordingly be got ready for the messenger to Algiers. So my love to 
one and all.

On 31 March, Friday afternoon — a few hours before I DISPATCHED 
my letter to youa —Fermé called; he told me inter alia of a secret 
vouchsafed to him by an Algerian meteorologist, namely that next 
week the weather would  d'abord* 0 be very wild for 3 days on account of 
the sirocco, after which there would be 3-4 wet days but finally a 
normal spring would step into the breach, booted and spurred. And 
anyone who doesn't believe it is mistaken. 
Meanwhile Saturday (1 April), as well as Monday (3 April), was 
warm (a bit 'too'  CLOSE)  but the wind (no sirocco yet) confined me to 
my balcony on account of the swirls of dust; by contrast, the morning 
of 2 April (Sunday) was so fine and inviting that I went for a 2 hours' 
stroll. 
Last night a piping wind; rain at ABOUT 5 o'clock this  morning;  dry

MARX TO JENNY LONGUET 
IN ARGENTEUIL 
[Algiers,] 6 April 1882 
My Sweet Child, 
Just now judge Fermé brought me your letter d. d. March 31; I am 
always delighted at your letters, but whenever, my dear child, did 
you find the time for writing them? I think often anxiously at your 
little household, limited to the services of this queer fish of Emily, and 
the four little boys a alone would absorb the whole working time of 
a superior servant. 
Fermé handed me also a few days ago the promised numbers of the 
Justice (ci-inclus h Hirsch's elucubrations reproduced from Madame 
Adam's Revue287 ). Longuet's articles on the 'grèves' c are very good. 
En passant.  He says somewhere that Lassalle did only  invent the words 
(not the law itself developed by Ricardo, Turgot, etc. 289). In fact, 
however, he, Lassalle, borrowed, to German 'cultured' people well 
known,  expression  of Goethe  who himself had modified  Sophocles'  ''ewige 
unwandelbare  Gesetze' à into 'ewige  eherne  Gesetze'.' 
Fermé had to sit opposite to me in my 'chambre',' silent, reading, 
until I had finished a letter to Tussy (from her I had the same day re­
ceived a letter, ditto one from Engels) to be ready for the messenger to 
Algiers. 
I expect Dr Stephann to-day. If he comes, I should be able to report 
on his examination, before despatching these lines you tomorrow 
morning. Meanwhile the progress of my health goes on satisfactory, 
though slowly for somebody eager to be again active and to drop that 
invalid's, stupid  métier.  All this delay is due to this violent Algerian dis­
temper, altogether quite anormous, never heard of since Fermé's 12 
years long sojourn here. The weather remains fidgety, fitful, capri­
cious;  April weather, from sunny changing suddenly into rainy, from 
hot to cold, chilly, from a sky diaphane g to scowling, almost black; 
from the dry atmosphere to being heavy with aqueous vapours; in

129. Marx to Jenny Longuet. 6 and 7 April 1882 231 
one word, the weather far from being 'settled' or having subsided to 
what here may be considered the average 'normal' Algerian 'spring' 
character. However, if the wind blows not violently, if there be no 
rain, the April's early hours were pleasant, so that I could indulge my 
morning promenades to-day, yesterday, and the day last before yes­
terday; thus I enjoyed three consecutive morning promenades one or 
two hours long. 
I am just interrupted by a noise rising from the little, in terraces 
mounting little garden (ein rotblühender  Garten a) that forms the avenue 
to our  Verandah  (behind it the first étage b of our Villa), while my  cham­
bre on the second  étage  (and 5 other ones) opens upon the little gallery 
over the Verandah, both of them looking at the sea before and 
from all sides to a charming panorama. Well, the noise called me 
upon the gallery, and how he would laugh, at my side, so heartfully, 
so delightfully, that little Johnny, below him in the garden a real 
pitch dark negro, dancing, playing a small fiddle, beating his long 
iron castagnettes, writhing his body into plastic grimaces and folding 
his face into broad humorous grins. These Algerian Negroes were 
formerly in general slaves of Turks, Arabs, etc., but were emancipat­
ed under the French régime. 
Well, there looks down behind him, the negro, another figure, in 
a dignified manner and rather condescendingly smiling at the bla-
ckie's exhibition. This is a Maure  (anglice  Moor, germ. Mohr);  en pass­
ant the Maures are called the Arabs in Algeria, a small minority of 
them, withdrawn from the desert and their communities, dwelling in 
the towns at the side of the Europeans. They are taller than the aver­
age French measure, oval faces, noses aquiline, eyes large and brilli­
ant; hairs and beards black, their skin's colour running over an  échel­
le' from almost white to darkly bronze. Their costumes — even if in 
tatters — elegant and graceful, a culotte 6 (or a mantle), a rather toga 
of thin white wool, or a capot  à capuchon';  for their cover of the head 
(for which the  capuchon  serves also in unfavourable (too hot etc.) 
weather) a turban or a piece of white  mousseline,  wound round their 
culottes;  generally they leave their legs naked, the feet also, but more 
rarely they wear pantoufles 1 of yellow or red maroquin. 
Even the poorest Maure surpasses the greatest European comedian

and dignified attitudes, whether walking or standing (if  they  ride on 
their mules, or asses, or exceptionally on horses,— always throwing 
their both legs on some side down, instead of a European taking his 
horse  between  his both legs — then they offer the image of indolence). 
Well, the said Maure —behind the negro in our garden — cries out 
for sale of'oranges' and 'cocks' (incl. hens), a strange combination of 
these articles vendible. Between the Maure, majestical even then, and 
the dancing grinning nigger there struts an animal — a most vain 
paon*  (belonging to one of our  co-pensionnaires b) with its wonderfully 
blue throat and most adorned long tail. At this trio, how my Johnny's 
laughter I should like to hear ring! 
It is now 4 o'clock p. m. (during part of the afternoon, I had of 
course some conversation with Fermé, having brought me your letter, 
then later on he removed himself to Algiers). The rain pours down: 
the sudden lowering of the temperature most disgusting. My best 
compliments to Dr Dourlen! 
7 April 1882 
Raining through the whole night; this morning is sky covered, but 
no rain; pleasant air, but too saturated with watery vapours. I had an 
hour's promenade (9-10 a.m.), doubtful whether not surprised by 
rain — but none yet. As Dr Stephann came not yesterday nor the day 
before, I wrote him to-day morning, but at all events these lines, in 
order to be despatched still to-day, cannot await the Doctor's exami­
nation. He will not appear before 5 o'clock afternoon. You see, it is 
a good sign, that the Dr neglects me a little; in other words, he is no 
longer anxious to strictly repeat his visits in court intervals. 
How I shall feel happy when returning to my grandsons and their 
excellent Maman! I am not at all inclined here to prolong my sojourn 
longer than the Dr considers it absolutely necessary. Many kisses 
from your

Dear child, I had already sealed this letter, but was forced to re­
open it. Dr Stephann came a bit earlier than expected. The fresh exam­
ination led him to conclude — and I am very pleased to be able to 
tell you this — that my left side has in the meantime healed almost as 
well as the right one. 290

MARX TO ENGELS 72 
IN LONDON 
[Algiers,] 8 April  * (Saturday) 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
At 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon I was examined by Dr Stephann. 
Despite the changeable weather, which had again brought on a per­
sistent cold, he was very satisfied; found that the épanchement b low 
down (to the left of my chest) had almost completely disappeared; the 
one on my back (low down on the left) being rather more stubborn. 
Yesterday he gave this a special lambasting by painting it with col­
lodion  cantharidal. c The result was most acute pain and, thanks to the 
'painting', a sleepless night (from 7 to 8 April), but this morning there 
has also been a  MOST  EFFECTIVE PUMPING  OF WATER from the blisters that 
have formed. So I have no doubt that this offending spot will also cap­
itulate in the very near future. My ASSISTANT-DOCTOR, Mr Casthelaz, 
had to work away for half an hour in my flourishing watermelon 
plantation, after which I was made to lie in bed until  déjeuner 6 at half 
past eleven; for after bandaging the drawing off, drop by drop, of any 
residual fluid works best in that position. 
On the other hand Stephann found my cough somewhat worse 
(only  relatively,  however, for the cough had reached a nadir), a con-

sequence of the absurd weather; for 4 days this week the  mornings  were 
fine enough for walks; since yesterday afternoon it has never stopped 
raining; in the night and today THE  RAIN  ASSUMED  THE 'caractère  torrentier; 
today there has been a feeble attempt at lighting the fire in the 
dining-room, but these fireplaces don't in fact seem to exist for that 
purpose,  BUT ONLY FOR SHOWS SAKE. 
After  déjeuner  I retired for a nap AT 2 O'CLOCK to make up in part for 
last night, but by some infernal chance the  courts  are on  vacation  this 
week and next. So my plan was thwarted by the otherwise most ami­
able  JUDGE  Fermé who didn't release me until ABOUT 5 p. m. when din­
ner time was approaching. Fermé told me amongst other things that 
during his  carrière  on the bench a form of  torture  has been used (and 
this happens 'regularly') to extract confessions from Arabs; naturally 
it is done (like the English in India) by the 'police'; the judge  is SUP­
POSED  TO KNOW  NOTHING  ABOUT  ALL  OF IT. On the other hand, he says that 
when, for example, a murder is committed by an Arab gang, usually 
with robbery in view, and the actual miscreants are in the course of 
time duly apprehended, tried and executed, this is not regarded as 
sufficient atonement by the injured colonist family. They demand 
INTO  THE  BARGAIN  the 'pulling in' of at least half a dozen  innocent  Arabs. 
But this is resisted by the French judges and particularly the cours 
d'appel," though now and again the life of an individual, isolated judge 
may be threatened by the colonists if he does not provisionally 
consent (his competence extends no further) to having a dozen in­
nocent Arabs locked up for suspected murder, burglary, etc., and 
involving them in the investigation. However we are aware that when 
a European colonist dwells among the 'lesser breeds', either as a set­
tler or simply on business, he generally regards himself as even more 
inviolable than handsome William I. Still, when it comes to bare­
faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the 'lesser breeds', to 
a grisly, Moloch-like obsession with atonement, the British and 
Dutch outdo the French. 
Pumps'  FAMILY  MISSION  shows great promise,288 as opposed to Hynd-
man's political mission which might be regarded as problematical. It 
serves the laddie right that your noteb should have annoyed him, 
especially since he took these liberties with me only because he was 
counting on my own inability, for 'considerations of propaganda', to 
compromise him in public.291 He knew that well enough.

a. paquebot  from Algiers to Marseilles, departure is at 5.30 in the after­

able to get you into the club in Rose Street295  and obtain assistance 
for you. In view of the way in which the people on the Freiheit have 
laid into the Social-Democratic Party in Germany, 296 I hardly feel 
called upon to give the adherents of that tendency a helping hand. 
However I do not know which tendency you belong to. The German 
Club,  which sides with the great party in Germany, is, as anyone will 
tell you, at 49 Tottenham Street297 and I find it inconceivable that 
both these clubs should let a fugitive party member starve to death.— 
In view of the great distress brought about among the members of 
the great Social-Democratic Party by police persecution in Germany,

MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE 166 
IN LONDON 
[Algiers,] Thursday, 13 April 1882 
Darling Cacadou, 
I reproach myself for not having written to you again until now, 
not that there's anything special to report from here. How often do 
I not think of you — at Eastbourne,298  beside my Jenny's" sick-bed, 
and during your faithful daily visits so cheering to that crosspatch, 
OLD NICK. But you should know, dear child, that this week and last 
were Fermé's Easter vacation; he lives in the rue Michelet (as part of 
the route Mustapha supérieur b is called) at the foot of the hill from 
which the Hôtel Victoria looks down. It's only a stone's throw away 
for him, although he has to 'clamber' since there's no proper path 
leading up to it. And in fact he has latterly been visiting me as­
siduously, thus frustrating the best of resolutions in regard to afternoon 
letter-writing.— Otherwise not an unwelcome guest, MR Fermé, nor 
devoid of humour. After I had given him some  Citoyens  and Égalités to 
read, he arrived chuckling not a little over Guesde's 'terrorism of the 
future' [which is to go on] until — this anticipated in heavy type — 
the last bourgeois oppressor has been guillotined out of existence. 
Fermé is not fond of Algiers whose climate doesn't suit either him or 
his family (often visited by fever, etc.) although its members are all of 
them 'des indigènes'  à commencer  par Madame  l'épouse. 1 Above all, how­
ever, his salary as a judge is hardly sufficient for even the most modest 
way of life. Living in a colonial capital is always expensive. But one 
thing he does admit — in no town ELSEWHERE, which is at the same 
time the seat of the central government, is there such laisser faire, lais­
ser passer A; police reduced to a bare minimum; unprecedented public 
sans gêne'; the Moorish element is responsible for this. For Mussul­
mans there is no such thing as subordination; they are neither 'sub­
jects'  nor  'administrés''  '; no authority, save in politica, g something 
which Europeans have totally failed to understand. Few police in Al-

giers,  and such as there are for the most part  indigènes.  And yet, with 
such a medley of national elements and unscrupulous characters, fre­
quent clashes are inevitable, and it is here that the  Catalonians  live up 
to their old reputation; the white or red belts they wear, like the 
Moors, etc., outside their coats and not, like the French, beneath 
their clothing, often conceal 'bodkins' —  long  stilettos which these 
sons of Catalonia are not slow to 'employ' with equal impartiality 
against Italians, Frenchmen, etc., and natives alike. Incidentally, 
a few days ago a gang of forgers was apprehended in the province of 
Oran, amongst them their  chief,  a former Spanish officer; their Euro­
pean agency, it now transpires, is in the capital of Catalonia — 
Barcelona! Some of the laddies were not arrested and escaped to 
Spain. This piece of news, and others of a similar kind, derives from 
Fermé. The latter has received 2 advantageous offers from the French 
government; firstly, a transfer to New Caledonia where he would, at 
the same time, be responsible for introducing a new legal system, sa­
lary 10,000 frs (he and family to travel there gratis and, on arrival, be 
given free official accommodation); or,  secondly,  to Tunis, where he 
would likewise occupy a higher magisterial rank than here, and 
under far more favourable conditions. He has been given a certain 
period in which to make up his mind; will accept one or the other. 
From Mr Fermé to the  weather  is a natural transition, since he freely 
heaps imprecations on the same.— Since Easter Monday (inch) 
I have not missed a single morning stroll, although only yesterday 
(12th) and today have been spared the caprices of April. Yesterday, 
bien que nous subissions le léger  siroco  et, par  conséquent,  quelques  coups de 
vent,  ce fut le maximum du beau temps: à 9 heures  le matin (le 12) le tem­
pérature à l'ombre fut de 19.5°, et celle au soleil, de 35°." In spite of 
having gone for a walk in the morning  ( 12  April), I visited Algiers in 
the afternoon in order to take a look at the Russian ironclad, Peter the 
Great, which had arrived in the harbour there a few days before. 
The official meteorological office has forecast intense atmospheric 
disturbances for 15-16 April (when there'll be orageh), 19, 21, 25, 27, 
29 and 30 April; nevertheless, the weather during the remainder of 
April will on the whole be fine; at the same time it is feared that in 
May, to make up for the absence of a true Algerian spring (which did 
a although we experienced a slight sirocco and, as a result, some gusts of wind, it was 
the finest possible weather: at 9 o'clock in the morning (the 12th) the temperature was

not begin till yesterday), summer will arrive  all at  once  and  with  it 
unbearable heat.  HOWEVER THAT MAY BE,  I do not, as  corpus vile," feel  in­
clined  to serve  as an  experimental station  for the  weather.  In view  of 
the altogether abnormal character  of the past 4'/2 months, God knows 
WHAT ALGERIA  MAY  HAVE  IN  STORE.  Large numbers of shrewd folk 
(amongst them l'illustre* 'Ranc') departed from  the  African shore 
day before yesterday.  I shall only stay until  Dr Stephann has declared 
my left side  to be in  good order again, apart,  of course, from  the  scar 
well known  to the  doctissimi'  Drs  Donkin  and  Hume, left  by an 
earlier attack of pleurisy. What has been tiresome here so  far is  the con­
stant recurrence of my cough, even if  WITHIN MODERATE LIMITS;  withal, 
much boredom. 
Interruption  of the  most argeeable  kind:  KNOCKS  AT THE DOOR;  Entrez! d 
Madame Rosalie  (ONE OF THE SERVING SPIRITS)  brings  me a  letter from 
you, dear Cacadou,  and,  from  the  good Gascon,'  a long letter  of 
which  the  paper, like  the  envelope, already bears  the  official stamp: 
'L'Union Nationale'. 299 This time  he seems  to have pulled  it off! Ce 
n'est pas  une de ces entreprises patronées  par Mr Ch. Hirsch! f On the other 
hand,  to be  sure,  the  prospect  of my  Cacadou's departure looms 
closer!  But  not just yet,  I trust. Also,  I regard  it as  some compensation 
that  AUNTY  Cacadou should represent  so great  a gain  to Jennychen 
and her  children«; anyway, with Paris  so close, there's  no  need  to 
spend  the  whole year  in London.— Apropos.  Has  Lafargue sent  the 
next instalment  of the article  to Petersburg?  (I don't know what  be­
came  of the first consignment.)  300 It's  most important  not to  lose the 
vantage point  of Petersburg;  it will gain  in importance daily! Also  for 
anyone  who  sends despatches there. 
Second interruption:  It is 1  O'CLOCK P.M.,  and I  have promised  to visit 
the 'Jardin du Hamrna'  ou h 'Jardin d'Essai' with Madame Casthelaz, son 
fils,' and one of our  other fellow pensionnaires,' Madame Claude 
(of Neufchâtel). We have to be back  BEFORE DINNER  (6 O'CLOCK P.M.), 
later than which  EVERY EFFORT AT WRITING NEVER  AS YET DARED UPON  BY ME. SO 
no more till tomorrow. Simply  by way  of a  supplement  * to the  useful 
knowledge  of Cacadou  I allow myself  to remark, that  on  that very

*I commence this letter at the  moment  when I have a few lines to be 
added to the foregoing, that is to say at about 1  o'clock  p. m. The day 
ended yesterday as fine as that of the 12th. Both  the evenings  12 and 13 
(about 8 hours p. m.) were warm — quite exceptional this — but cool 
(relatively) at the same time, hence really delightful. This morning 
the warmth a little more 'heavy', and just since two hours the wind 
blows violently, probably the 'orage' predicted yesterday from 14-15. 
Yesterday at 1 o'clock p. m. we went down to Inferior Mustapha 
whence the tram brought us to Jardin Hamma or Jardin d'Essai, the 
which used for 'Promenade Publique' with occasional military music, 
as 'pépinière''*  for the production and diffusion of the indigenous vege­
tables,  at last for the purpose of  scientific botanical experiments  and as 
a garden  of'acclimatation'. — This all encloses a very large ground, part 
of which is mountainous, the other belonging to the plain. In 
order to see more minutely, you would want at least a whole day, and 
beside being somebody with you a connaisseur,  f. i. like M. Fermé's 
friend and old Fourieriste, M. Durando, professor of botanies, who is 
the leader of a section of the 'Club Alpin Français' on its regular Sun­
day excursions. (I very much regretted that my bodily circumstances 
and the Dr. Stephann's strict prohibition till now did not yet allow 
me to share in these excursions, having 3 times [been] invited there-
to.) 
Well, before entering the 'Jardin d'Essai' we took coffee, of course 
in the free air, a Mauresque 'café'. The Maure prepared it excel­
lently, we were on a bank. On a rough table, in inclined positions, 
their legs crossed, half a dozen Maure visitors [...] e were delighted in 
their small 'cafetières'/ (everyone gets one of his own) and together 
a remnants of his shattered army aboard the vessels which had escaped the storm of the 
26th and been rallied with much difficulty by Doria, at Matifu. This latter place, whe­

playing  at cards  (a conquest this  on them  of civilisation). Most strik­
ing this spectacle: Some these Maures were dressed pretentiously, 
even richly, others  in, for  once  I dare call  it blouses, sometime  of 
white woollen appearance,  now in  rags  and  tatters  — but in the  eyes 
of a true Musulman such accidents, good  or bad  luck,  do not  distin­
guish Mahomet's children. Absolute equality  in their social intercourse,  not 
affected;  on the  contrary, only when demoralized, they become aware 
of it; as to the  hatred against Christians  and the  hope  of an  ulti­
mate victory over these infidels, their politicians justly consider this 
same feeling  and  practice  of absolute equality  (not of  wealth  or posi­
tion but of  personality)  a guarantee of keeping  up the one, of  not giv­
ing up the  latter.* (Nevertheless, they will  go to  rack  and  ruin  WITH­
OUT A REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.) 
*In regard  to the  plain part of the Jardin d'Essai  I remark only:  It is 
cut by  three great longitudinal 'allées'  a of a  wonderful beauty; oppo­
site to the  principal entry  is the  'allée'  of the  platenes [platanes] b; 
then  the  'allée  des  palmiers' ',c ended  by an  oasis  of immense  72  'pal­
miers' , limited  by the  railway  and the sea; at  last  the  'allée'  of the 
magnolia  and a  sort of figues [ficus roxburghi) . These three great 'allées' 
are themselves  cut by  many others crossing them, such  as the  long 
'allée  des  bambous' astonishing,  the  'allée'  of 'palmiers  à chanvre', A 
the 'dragon[n]iers',c the 'eucalyptus' (blue gum of Tasmania), etc., 
(the latter are of an extraordinarily quick vegetation). 
Of course, these sorts of*  allées  cannot be reproduced in European 
'Jardins d'acclimatation'.' 
During the afternoon there was a concert of military music in 
a large open space encircled by plane trees; the conductor, a non­
commissioned officer, wore ordinary French uniform, whereas the 
musicians (common soldiers) wore red, baggy trousers (of oriental 
cut),  white felt boots buttoning up to the bottom of the baggy trou­
sers;  on their heads a red fez. 
While on the subject of the garden, I did not mention (though 
some of these were very pleasing to the nose) orange trees, lemon — 
ditto,  almond trees, olive trees, etc.; nor, for that matter, cactuses and 
aloes which also grow wild (as do wild olives and almonds) in the 
rough country where we have our abode.

is abominable about this and similar excursions is the ubiquitous 
chalky  dust;  though I felt well in the afternoon and after coming home 
and during the night, my cough was nonetheless rather troublesome, 
thanks to the irritation caused by the dust. 
I am expecting Dr Stephann today, but as I cannot put off the 
despatch of this missive, I will send a report to Fred" later on. 
Finally, as Mayer of Swabia used to say, let us take a little look at 
things from a higher historical perspective. Our nomadic Arabs (who 
have,  in many respects, gone very much to seed while retaining, as 
a result of their struggle for existence, a number of sterling qualities) 
have memories of having once produced great philosophers, scholars, 
etc., which, they think, is why Europeans now despise them for their 
present ignorance. Hence the following little fable, typical of Arab 
folklore. 
A ferryman is ready and waiting, with his small boat, on the tem­
pestuous waters of a river. A philosopher, wishing to get to the other 
side,  climbs aboard. There ensues the following dialogue: 
Philosopher:  Do you know anything of  history,  ferryman? 
Ferryman: No! 
Philosopher:  Then you've wasted half your life! 
And again: The  Philosopher:  Have you studied mathematics? 
Ferryman: No! 
Philosopher:  Then you've wasted more than half your life. 
Hardly were these words out of the philosopher's mouth when the 
wind capsized the boat, precipitating both ferryman and philosopher 
into the water. Whereupon, 
Ferryman shouts: Can you swim? 
Philosopher:  No! 
Ferryman: Then you've wasted your whole life. 
That will tickle your appetite for things Arabic. 
With much love and many kisses.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 
IN ZURICH 
London, 17 April 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
As soon as I heard from Lavrov that the preface  " had appeared in 
the JVarodnaya Volya  302 I asked for a copy of the original,0  but he had 
left it in his desk in Paris; however, he said he would write. Then 
I went to Marx's and searched in vain for the  brouillon.''  Finally 
I got Lavrov to let me have a copy of the Russian translation so that, 
if the worst came to the worst, I could retranslate it  myself;  I feared, 
as indeed happened, that some Russian or other would see to this. 
Lavrov has just sent me the enclosed copy of the original. However, 
I have only myself to blame for this. For I had meant to send you 
a postcard, but have got Schorlemmer and Adolf Beust staying with 
me, and there's quite a lot of gadding about with Mrs Lafargue 
(whose husband d is in Paris) and Tussy Marx, so that the postcard 
got overlooked. But in order that you may see that good intentions 
were not wanting, I am belatedly sending you the thing. 
Congratulations on your attack upon Geiser's spineless conduct.303 
Confidential: Marx has been in Algiers since 21 February. On ar­
rival he had a fresh attack of pleurisy as a result of catching cold on 
the journey; he found wretched weather conditions, but is now pretty 
well all right again. How long he'll stay there is not yet certain. Has 
had distinctly bad luck with the weather. 
Kindest regards from 
Yours,

MARX TO ENGELS 72 
IN LONDON 
[Algiers,] Tuesday, 18 April 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
Got your letter yesterday,284 likewise Tussy's, together with the 
'imperial' remittance.3 
In my last letter to Laurachen b I announced the arrival of our 
'2 finest days'; but even before I had finished the letter, the sirocco 
(the official weather bulletins, like other French printed matter, 
spell it sometimes with one c, sometimes with 2) began to blow and 
the din served me as an overture to the  'mouvements atmosphériques  in­
tenses'  c which had been predicted. I admitted to Laura that I was 
tired of such things — if not, indeed, tired of Africa, and was determined 
to turn my back on Algiers the moment Dr Stephann DID NO LONGER 
'WANT ME'. 
From the 14th April (afternoon) to the 17th April, gusts of wind, 
storms, heavy downpours, burning sunshine, continual ups and 
downs, now hot now cold (almost from one hour to the next). First 
thing this morning gloriously fine, but now, at 10  A.M.,  the wind is al­
ready piping its maddening tune.— In its report — or rather fore­
cast— yesterday, the meteorological office announced an  'intense  mouve­
ment  atmosphérique'  for 3-4 May, but more especially for 7-8 May (not 
having pro nunc à probed any further into the future); in addition, for 
the first week of this self-same May, it has promised us so  CALLED  'seis-
miques mouvements'' (apparently the periodicity of these 'seismiques' 
coincides with latent earth tremors). 
Dr Stephann called on the 16th (Sunday), percussed, and declared 
that there was no longer any trace of 'pleurésie' r (AS FAR AS TO' rechute' S); 
on the other hand he was, he said, less satisfied with the bronchial 
condition (also on the left) than when he last examined me. However, 
he painted away with great vigour (a vigour I damned well had time 
to appreciate in the course of Sunday afternoon—16 April — and 
a Engels had arranged the remittance through the bankers Kayser & Co. Kaiser 
= Emperor.-' 1 See this volume, pp. 238-43.-' intense atmospheric disturbances -
d for the time being-0 seismic disturbances-1 pleurisy-8 relapse

night, and right into the small hours of Monday—17 April!).— 
Incidentally, Dr Stephann shares my view that bronchial trouble is 
inseparable from this weather and, such being the case, any prolon­
gation of my stay here could only have unfavourable consequences. 
He thinks he will be able to let me leave, with a written diagnosis, at 
the end of April unless something unforeseen should happen — e. g. 
the weather here take a distinct turn for the better or, which seems 
unlikely, my health take a turn for the worse. All things being equal, 
then, I should leave  on 2 May, being delivered back to Marseilles by the 
selfsame Said under the same Captain Mace (very nice chap) who 
brought me to Algiers, and from there should go and try my luck at 
Cannes, Nice or Menton. So don't send me either letters or anything 
in the way of documents or newspapers from London,  unless  it be JUST 
AFTER  THE  RECEIPT  OF THESE  ums. But should I change my mind in the 
meantime, I shall at once notify you from here. 
I am afraid that '/«oV may arrive in Algiers after not only I, but 
also the Casthelaz FAMILY, have evacuated Africa; all the world's pre­
paring to take flight. You must excuse the meagreness of this MISSIVE. 
The night of the 16th to 17th April was sleepless because of the vigour 
of the painting; no pain from the 17th to the 18th April because the 
ASSISTANT DOCTOR  a had already attended to me by 7 o'clock yesterday 
morning; but the itching due to the formation of new skin banished 
sleep for the 2nd night running. Since, in addition, I went for a stroll 
(2 whole hours) very early this morning, iiw begrijph  (I can no longer 
recall how the Dutch spell it, but I still hear the ü begreipl  — what it's 
got to do with 'concept', God alone knows — as enunciated in the old 
days at Zalt-Bommel 304 by Pastor RothhausV wife, since divorced 
and replaced by my cousind),  IN ONE WORD, as you can conceive, I have 
got to lay my head on my pillow and make up for some sleep. Mean­
while:—  sleep,  what would'st thou more? Only first let me tell you 
about the rotten trick played by the French authorities on a poor, 
thieving Arab, a poor, multiple assassin by profession. Only at the 
last minute —  ON THE  MOMENT,  as the infamous COCKNEYS say,  'TO  LAUNCH' 
the poor sinner  'INTO  ETERNITY' did he discover that he wasn't going to 
be shot but guillotined! This, in  defiance  of prior  arrangements!  In defi­
ance of promises!  He was guillotined despite what had been agreed. 
But that wasn't all. The French having always permitted this hith-

erto,  his relatives had expected the head and body to be handed over 
to them so that they could sew the former to the latter and then bury 
the 'whole'. Quod non!* Howls, imprecations and gnashing of teeth; 
the French authorities dug their heels in, the first time they had done 
so! Now, when the body arrives in paradise, Mohammed will ask, 
'Where have you left your head? Or, how did the head come to be 
parted from its body? You're not fit to enter paradise. Go and join 
those dogs of Christians in hell!' And that's why his relations were so 
upset.

On closer inquiry—I hadn't asked him before — Stephann told 
me that, although he doesn't speak German, he is the son of a Ger­
man. His father emigrated to Algiers from the Palatinate (Landau).

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 
IN ZURICH 
London, 21 April 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I am sending you a piece from the Kölner Leitung on 'Baron 
Hirsch'. 305 It is significant that  bourgeois  papers should find it neces­
sary to denounce such a trickster. The whole article is worth reprint­
ing if space is available. It would make a splendid feuilleton, particu­
larly as emanating from the  Kölnische  Reifung. If you can't reprint it 
in its entirety, perhaps you would return it to me when you have done 
with it. You might also return me the ms. of the 'Preface' b sometime. 
Let me elucidate: Mahmud Nedim Pasha is, like Mahmud Damat 
a But no.-b  K. Marx and F. Engels, 'Preface to the Second Russian Edition of the

Pasha (the Sultan'sa  brother-in-law), Russia's chief paid agent in 
Constantinople. When the Russian, Poliakov, who was also after the 
Turkish railway concessions, had failed to get them (for the Russians 
could not start a war against Turkey and simultaneously con the 
Turks),  it was naturally of the utmost concern to the Russians to see 
to it that the terms imposed upon the Austrian, Hirsch, who was the 
sole competitor and, what's more, Austria's protégé, were of such 
a kind as to make Hirsch, and with him Austria, hated in Turkey and 
to prevent Turkey from getting a coherent railway network after all. 
Besides, anything that weakened Turkey financially was advanta­
geous to Russia — relatively speaking. So Nedim does his deal. Hirsch 
pays him for selling Turkey to him and Russia pays him again just for 
selling Turkey. The fact is that Russian diplomacy does business in 
the grand manner, with none of your small shopkeeper's niggardly, 
envious eye to his competitors and hence, if there's no other way of 
doing it, it can even permit an adversary like Austria an apparent or 
momentary advantage and nevertheless turn this to its own account. 
Kindest regards to you and Kautsky. 
Yours, 
F. E.

2 May (Tuesday) on the same Said and with the same commandant' 
MR Mace, 'lieutenant de vaisseau\ h as brought me to Algiers. Last 
Wednesday I paid a visit to a French squadron of 6 ironclads; natu­
rally I inspected the flagship, Le Colbert, where a petty officer, 
a handsome, intelligent lad, showed me around and demonstrated 
everything in detail. As I took my leave he told me in typically 
French fashion that he was sick of his boring duties and hoped to get 
his discharge  bientôt."  I and my companions .(3  co-locataires ä from the 
Hôtel Victoria) were not allowed on board until after 'duties'. So we 
watched the manoeuvres of the flagship and the 5 other ironclads 
from our boat, alias  skiff,  as we rowed to and fro. There is to be 
a 'ball' on the  Colbert  tomorrow afternoon. I could have got hold of an 
invitation card for this, too, through Fermé, but there wasn't time. 
For on Tuesday (25 Avril) I was given my final examination by 
Stephann; no more tatouement' with collodion;  quo-ad f a recurrence of 
pleurisy ALTOGETHER  ABSOLVED;  however I'm to see him tomorrow (Sa­
turday) at 3 o'clock to get his written diagnosis and take my leave of 
him. The weather is now very hot on occasion, but IN  FACT  a hurri­
cane—  with sirocco storms coming and going — has persisted (un­
interruptedly at night, in repeated gusts during the day) throughout 
the week (including TO-DAY) . That is the reason why my cough has not 
responded hitherto; HENCE high time to flee Algiers. 
Best wishes to all.

Apropos; because of the sun, I have done away with my prophet's

Dearest Child, 
Only 2 lines: I think only seaside living can help poor Harry. You 
ought — if  possibly  — lose no time to get him and his brothersa to Nor­
mandy. It is childish to fancy that in any case I should return to En­
gland without a previous visit to you and my grandsons, whether 
we meet in Normandy, at Paris, or elsewhere. 
As to my health, it proceeds favourably; otherwise Dr Stephann 
would not allow me to leave 'Africa'. I think, 2 weeks or so, will  suf­
fice for the 'transitory' stadium at the Riviera.

Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Could you not send me some additional offprints of the article on

see the Sozialdemokrat; 3 or 4 would suffice. 
Encl. a note which is of interest in that it gives evidence of the co­
lossal speed with which the concentration of capitals is taking place in 
America. UNITED STATES BONDS are  Staatsschuldscheine  der Vereinigten  Staa­
ten. N.Y.C. and H.R. STOCK are the shares of the NEW YORK CENTRAL

A dollar is slightly more than 4 marks = roughly 4 marks = 5 frs. 
Delighted to see that people everywhere are supporting the Sozial­
demokrat against the whines of the milksops. 
Darwin's letter was of course addressed to Marx and was an ex­
tremely kind one.307  But beware of the article by Lafargue in the 
Citoyen of 28 April on 'La sélection  darwinienne et les classes  régnantes' 
which he concludes with the discovery of a new Amphioxus; it's too 
funny for words. Lafargue is in Paris and I have just written to 
him 284 pouring frightful scorn on his Amphioxus Lafargii. 
Best wishes.

Don't let the Society here8 mislead you about the DEMOCRATIC FED­
ERATION.158 So far, the latter has been of no importance at all. Its 
leader is an ambitious parliamentary candidate by the name of 
Hyndman, a former Conservative; only with the help of the Irish and 
with specifically Irish aims in view can he succeed in staging a big 
meeting, and when he does he plays third fiddle; otherwise the Irish 
would tell him where to get off. 
Gladstone has made a dreadful ass of  himself—  his Irish policy has 
failed utterly; is having to drop Forster and the LORD LIEUTENANT of 
Ireland, Cowper Temple (whose father was a Palmerston on his moth­
er's side)," and say pater peccavi b; the Irish Members of Parliament 
have been released, the Coercion Bill has not been extended, part of 
the farmers' rent arrears are to be cancelled, another part to be taken 
over by the state against fair amortisation.308 On the other hand, the 
TORIES have now got to the stage of wanting to salvage whatever there 
is to be salvaged; thus, before the farmers  take possession  of the land, 
a Engels confuses Francis Thomas Cowper with William Cowper-Temple, who was 
the son of the 5th Earl Cowper. After the latter's death his widow married, as her sec­
ond husband, Lord Palmerston.- b Father, I have sinned (Luke 15:18).

MARX TO ENGELS' 2 
IN LONDON 
Monte Carlo, 8 May 1882 
Hôtel de Russie 
DEAR FRED, 
2 or 3 weeks before I left Algiers (at the beginning of May),310 the 
meteorologists had already forecast storms at sea. In fact, during my 
last days in Africa, the sirocco blew itself out and very hot weather set 
in, spoilt, however, by gusts of wind, eddies of dust and unexpected, if 
temporary and often short-lived, drops in temperature. During that 
same time my bronchial catarrh grew worse and has not yet been 
properly subdued. The storm at sea (during the night of 4 to 5 May) 
was such that, even in the cabin, there was an appreciable draught. It 
was pouring when I arrived in Marseilles (on the morning of 5 May), 
and continued to rain all the way to Nice. I even imported  one  wet day 
(yesterday) into Monte Carlo; glorious weather today. So you see 
how constant I have remained, for until I arrived it hadn't rained for 
months in Nice or Monte Carlo. But this time it was just badinage, 
not real earnest as in Algiers. 
In Nice, where I spent the 5th and 6th, I soon discovered that the 
wind could be very capricious and that a uniform, even temperature 
was by no means to be expected. Today my brief experience was con­
firmed by Dr Delachaux,  médecin-chirurgien*  (lives at Interlaken), who 
is staying at the same hotel here. He has spent his holiday touring 
Nice and its environs, and the most famous places on the Riviera 
* generally, so far with an eye to business as to ascertain which places 
he might best recommend to sufferers of lung diseases, bronchial ca­
tarrh of a chronic character, etc. He declared decidedly against Nice, 
but preferred Monte Carlo even to Menton.* Dr Delachaux returns 
to his native Switzerland today. 
You will know EVERYTHING about the charm exerted by the beauties 
of nature here, whether from your own observations,311 or from 
paintings and printed descriptions. Many of its features vividly recall 
those of Africa.

As regards a 'warm, dry atmosphere', it will soon, generally speak­
ing, be available everywhere. The sun-spots indicate that there will 
be intense activity of the rays, and a drought is feared in France. 
FOR  CONSCIENCE SAKE I shall consult Kunemann, a German doctor, 
here tomorrow. I have with me Dr Stephann's written diagnosis 
(only on looking at his visiting card do I see that Stephann is also Pro­
fesseur suppléant à l'Ecole de Médecine" at the faculty of Algiers) which 
will spare me further talkee-talkee.— As soon as Stephann declared 
that I was rid of my pleurisy, I at once began, as prescribed by him 
(Stephann), to embrocate with tincture of iodine all the spots on the 
upper part (left) of my chest and back. Since the time I boarded the 
ship until TO-DAY I have discontinued these operations which 
would in any case be 'difficult' for me to carry out in person on my 
own back, despite Dr Delachaux's advice that I should attempt it 
with the help of a mirror. Qui  vivra  verrai At all events, I shall speak to 
Dr Kunemann first.I am anxious to get out and about in the open air 
as much as I can. 
Practically all the Parisian and Italian papers and periodicals are 
to be found in the reading room of the Monte Carlo Casino; a fair se­
lection of German papers, very few English. I read in the Petit Mar­
seillais of today's date about 'l'assassinat de lord Cavendish et de 
M. Burke'. 312 The public here, e.g. my table-d'hôte companions in 
the Hôtel de Russie, is, by contrast, more interested in what goes on 
in the Casino's salles  de jeu {tables de roulette et de  trente-et-quarante) . c 
I was particularly amused by a son of Albion, sulky, ill-tempered and 
bewildered,  AND  WHY?  Because he had lost a certain number of yellow 
boys,  whereas he had been absolutely intent on 'copping' the same. 
He couldn't understand that not even British boorishness is able  'TO 
BULLY'  fortune. 
These lines must be my last since letters from here have first to be 
sent to the post office in Monaco by messenger. 
Kindest regards to all.

Dear Jennychen, 
The said Monte Carlo, whence I send you these lines, is one of the 
3 places (adjoining one another) whose trinity constitutes the state of 
'Monaco' (i.e. Monaco, Condamine and Monte Carlo). A really 
beautiful situation. Climate preferable to that of Nice or even Men-
ton. 
I need hardly say that with comical consistency I imported into the 
region the first 2 rainy days (since January)  ; it would seem that they 
were only awaiting my arrival from Algiers for this to happen. Apart 
from that I struck magnificent weather. 
As you will have learnt from my last letter," I am quit of my pleu­
risy; the bronchial catarrh can only clear up very gradually. More­
over the atmosphere will soon be warm and dry  everywhere  (which, 
however, raises fears of a water shortage); the intensity of the sun's ac­
tion will be all the greater for its being strewn with large spots. So 
everywhere there will soon be the kind of weather I need. 
As I am not sure how long I shall be staying here, I should like you 
to let me know at once from Paris where I can find you; it would be 
best if you  telegraphed  me here, for a telegram will give me sufficient in­
formation in 3 or 4 words. 
Lots of kisses for the children.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN ' ' 3 
IN ZURICH 
London, 10 May313 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
My afternoon having already been broken into, I shall employ it in 
writing to you. As regards the Virgin Mary-Isis, that was a point 
upon which I could not enlarge, if only for reasons of space. 314 Like 
all hagiolatry, the Marian cult belongs to a much later period than 
the one I am considering (a time when it was clerical policy to pro­
duce in the persons of the saints a new version of the polytheistic peas­
antry's numerous tutelary gods), and finally it would be necessary to 
provide historical proof of the derivation, which would demand spe­
cialised study. The same applies to the gloria and moonlight. In the 
imperial days of Rome, by the way, the cult of Isis was part of the 
state religion. 
Bimetallism.3  The main thing — particularly after many of the 'lea­
ders'  have been so frightfully cock-a-hoop about our party's 
superiority over the bourgeois in matters of economics, a superiority 
of which those gentlemen are totally innocent—the main thing is 
that we should beware of inviting censure in this field as is unblush-
ingly done by the said gentlemen the moment they think it will serve 
to flatter a particular kind of worker, win an electoral victory or gain 
some other advantage. Thus, because silver is mined in Saxony, they 
think it in order to dabble in the bimetallist nonsense. So to catch 
a few more votes, our party is to go and make an immortal ass of itself 
in the very sphere which is  supposed  to be its forte! 
But that's our literary gents all  over!  Just like the bourgeois literati, 
they think themselves entitled to the privilege of learning nothing and 
laying down the law about everything. They have, for our benefit, 
concocted a hotch-potch of literature which, for ignorance of eco­
nomics, new-fangled utopianism and arrogance, has yet to find an 
equal, and Bismarck did us a tremendous favour by banning it. 
When we speak of bimetallism today, it is not so much bimetallism 
generally as the specific case of bimetallism in which the ratio of gold 
to silver is, say, 15l\i\ 1. A distinction must therefore be drawn here. 
Bimetallism is becoming daily more impracticable in that the ratio 

=====第285页=====
144. Engels to Bernstein. 10 May 1882 257 
of the value of silver to that of gold which, at one time, was at least 
fairly constant and changed only gradually, is1 now subject to daily 
and violent fluctuations, the initial tendency being for the value of  sil­
ver to fall as a result of the colossal increase in production, especially 
in North America. The exhaustion of gold is an invention of the silver 
barons. But whatever the cause of the change in value, it remains 
a fact and that is what concerns us first of  all. Silver is becoming daily 
less capable of serving as a measure of value, whereas gold is not. 
The ratio of the value of the two is now about  17 ' J2 : 1. But the sil­
ver people want to reimpose upon the world the old ratio of  15 ' \Ï : 1, 
and that  is just as impossible as maintaining the price of mechanically 
produced yarn and cloth everywhere and for all time at that of man­
ually produced yarn and cloth. The die does not determine the value 
of the coin, it is merely a guarantee, for the recipient, of weight and 
standard and can never confer on  15 ' /2 lbs of silver the value of  17 ' ji. 
All this is dealt with so lucidly and exhaustively in Capital, chapter 
on money (Chap. Ill, pp. 72-120) 315  that there's nothing more to 
add. For material relating to more recent fluctuations, cf. Soetbeer: 
Edelmetall —Produktion und  Werthverhältnis  etc. (Gotha, Perthes, 1879). 
Soetbeer is the leading authority in this sphere, and the father of 
German currency reform — even before 1840 he was advocating 
a 'mark' equivalent to '/3 taler. 
Hence, if silver is minted at 15' /Î lbs = 1 lb. gold, it flows back into 
the state treasuries, everyone wants to be rid of it. That's what the 
United States discovered in the case of its silver dollar minted to the 
old standard and worth only 90 c, as did Bismarck when he tried for­
cibly to put back into circulation the silver talers that had been with­
drawn and replaced by gold. 
Mr Dechend, the chairman of the Bank, imagines that bimetallism 
will enable him to pay off Germany's external debts in bad silver in­
stead of gold at full value, and thus avoid any kind of gold crisis, 
something that would certainly be most convenient for the Reichs­
bank if only it were feasible. But all that is forthcoming is the proof 
provided by Mr Dechend  himself,  that he is totally unfitted to preside 
over a bank and would be more at home at a school desk than a 
board-room table. 
Your Prussian Junker, too, would certainly be happy if the mortga­
ges he contracted in silver at 15'/2: 1 could be repaid or serviced in 
silver at 17l  /a : 1. And since this would necessarily occur inside the 
country, it would be perfectly feasible for debtors to rook their credi-

tors by this means — provided only the aristocracy could find people 
to lend them silver at  17 '  ji : 1 in order that they might make repay­
ments at 15l  J2 : 1. For their own means certainly do not permit them 
to make repayments. But they would, of course, be compelled to 
accept their silver at 15l/t and thus, so far as they were concerned, 
everything would remain as before. 
As regards the German production of silver, its extraction from 
German ore dwindles yearly in importance as compared with 
(Rhenish) extraction from South American ore. Total production in 
Germany in 1876 amounted to about 280,000 lbs, of which 58,000 
were from South American ore; since that time this figure has risen 
considerably. 
That the debasing of silver to the status of a fractional currency 
must depress the value of silver still further is obvious; the use of silver 
for purposes other than money is minimal, nor is it likely to show a 
rapid increase because demonetisation throws more silver on to the 
market. 
It is inconceivable that England should ever introduce bimetal­
lism. No country that is on the gold standard could re-introduce 
bimetallism now and on a permanent basis. In any case,  universal  bime­
tallism does not admit of general application; if all men were to agree 
today that silver was once more to be worth  15 ' /i : 1, they could not 
alter the fact that it is worth only  17 ' /2: 1, and there's absolutely 
nothing to be done about it. One might just as well decide that twice 
two equals five. 
During our early days of exile Bamberger did us many a good turn; 
he was a decent and obliging man, secretary to Karl of Brunswick. 
We subsequently lost sight of him.316

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 16 May 1882 
Dear Bebel, 
I have been long meaning to write to you. Particularly since 
I don't know whether Marx has answered your last letter.317 He 
several times promised me that he would, but you know how it is 
when one is ill. So today I have at last got round to it. 
Marx first went to the Isle of Wight,234 but the weather there was 
cold and wet. Then to Algiers via Paris. Caught cold again during the 
journey, encountering more wet, chilly weather in Algiers, later suc­
ceeded by rapid variations in temperature. Once again his cold as­
sumed the form of pleurisy, less severe than his first attack here, but 
long drawn-out. Now he is thoroughly recovered and, since it has at 
last got really hot in Africa, has fled to Monte Carlo, the gaming 
establishment of the Prince of Monaco.2  As soon as the summer has 
really begun, he will leave and join Madame Longuet and her child­
ren on the Normandy coast; is unlikely to be back before the begin­
ning of July. All he has got to do now is shake off once and for all 
his obstinate cough, and in this he will probably succeed. He had 
his photograph taken in Algiers and is looking quite his old self 
again. 
It is a great misfortune that you, of all people, should have suffered 
defeat in elections which otherwise went off so splendidly.222  Your 
presence was doubly necessary in view of the many new, and in some 
cases unreliable, elements that have got in. Indeed it would seem 
that, at the start, a number of not very edifying blunders were perpet­
rated. Now things seem to be going rather better. I was therefore 
doubly delighted (and Marx no less so) by the courageous attitude of 
the Sozialdemokrat, which did not hesitate to come out unequivocally 
against the whining and pusillanimity of Breuel & Co., even when 
deputies such as Bios and Geiser came out in favour of it. 3 '8 We, too, 
were appealed to, and Viereck wrote me a very pathetic letter about 
the paper whereat I informed him of my view in altogether amiable if 
no uncertain terms 284 and, since that time, have heard nothing more

of him. Hepner, too, has passed this way, 'sick at heart and poor of 
purse'" and terribly sorry for  himself;  he had written a very indiffer­
ent little pamphlet262  from which I could see how greatly he had de­
teriorated morally. The chief plaint in both cases was that the So­
zialdemokrat failed to take account of the laws presently in force in 
Germany, the contents of the paper being such that its distributors 
were had up by the German courts for lèse majesté,  high treason, etc. 
Yet it is perfectly evident from the paper itself and the reports of the 
proceedings against our people that, whatever the circumstances, and 
no matter how the paper was written, those swine on the bench 
would find some pretext for committing them. To write a paper in 
such a way as to afford no handle to the said judges is an art that has 
yet to be discovered. And, what is more, these gentlemen forget that 
an organ as weak-kneed as they desire would drive our people pretty 
well en  masse  into Most's camp. However, I shall none the less advise 
Bernstein, h to whom we have otherwise lent our moral support when­
ever possible, to modulate the tone of moral indignation a bit by the 
use of irony and derision, for such a tone, if it is not to become boring, 
has to be so stepped up as ultimately to become ridiculous. 
Singer came to see me the day before yesterday and from him 
I learned that the forwarding address is still all right, something I was 
not quite sure about since we haven't used it for so long. He has 
another drawback. He belongs to those who regard the nationalisa­
tion of anything as a semi-, or at all events pre-, socialist measure and 
are therefore secret devotees of protective tariffs, tobacco monopoly, 
nationalised railways, etc. These prevarications are the legacy of the 
unduly one-sided fight against Manchesterism 176 and, because they 
facilitate debate in a middle-class and 'eddicated' environment, enjoy 
a considerable following particularly among those bourgeois and aca­
demic elements who have come over to us. You in Berlin, he tells me, 
recently debated the point, he being luckily outvoted. We cannot, for 
the sake of such minor considerations, afford to discredit ourselves 
either politically or economically. I tried to make him see that in our 
view 1. protective tariffs are quite the wrong thing for Germany (not, 
however, for America), because our industry has expanded and be­
come a viable exporter under free trade, but for it to be a viable ex­
porter, competition from foreign semi-manufactures on the home 
market is absolutely essential; that the iron industry, which produces

4 times more than is required by the home market, uses the protective 
tariff only against the  home market  while selling  abroad,  as the facts go to 
show, at give-away prices; 2. that the tobacco monopoly is nationali­
sation on so minute a scale that it can't even do duty for an example in 
the debate nor, for that matter, do I give a damn whether or not Bis­
marck puts it into effect since çfither way it must eventually redound 
to our benefit; 3. that the nationalisation of railways is of benefit only 
to the shareholders who sell their shares above value, but of no benefit 
at all to us because we should be able to deal as summarily with one 
or two big companies as with the state, once we had the latter; that 
the joint-stock companies have already provided proof of the extent 
to which the bourgeois as such is redundant, in as much as the man­
agement is wholly in the hands of salaried officials, nor would nationa­
lisation provide any further argument. However, he had got the thing 
too firmly fixed in his mind and agreed with me only to the extent of 
admitting that, from a political viewpoint, your dismissive attitude 
was the only correct one. 
Time for the post. Kindest regards to yourself and Liebknecht.

262 146. Marx to Engels. 20 May 1882 
In my last letter (I don't know exactly whether I wrote to you di­
rect, or to Tussy or to Laura), I said I would let you have further de­
tails after my encounter with Dr Kunemann." This took place on 8th 
May; he is an Alsatian, a scientifically (medically) educated man; 
e. g. he told me about Dr Koch on the bacillus before I got your let­
ter 284; has a large practice; 52-54 years old at the very least, since he 
was a student at Strasbourg university in 1848; politically, he has 
found the paper Le Temps to be the organ that corresponds most 
closely to his temperament; science, he said, had convinced him that 
progress could only be 'slow'; no revolutionary upheaval — for other­
wise,  progress would, in consequence, be forced to 'double back' al­
most as far as it had come (as in the Echternach procession, 3 '9 p. e.h ); 
first prerequisite, education of the masses and 'non-masses', etc.  IN ONE 
WORD,  POLITICALLY,  A REPUBLICAN  PHILISTINE;  I mention this merely to show 
why I didn't go into such matters with him aside from discussing the 
'Machiavellian' politics of Charles III, absolute tyrant of Monaco. 
He regards me as an 1848 man and, apart from that date, I vouch­
safed no further particulars as to the rest of my PUBLIC ACTIVITY. Now to 
the matter in hand. Originally he concluded from my visiting  card, 
which has Dr on it and which I had had conveyed to him through his 
maid, that I was a Dr of Med., his view being further confirmed by 
Dr Stephann's card which I handed to him, ditto those of  my new medi­
cal acquaintance' from Interlaken, and of Dr Donkin, whom I men­
tioned as the friend of my friend  Prof.  Ray Lankester, since he wished 
to know who had treated me in London, etc. Then I gave him 
Stephann's  consultation  écrite i to read. 
Well, since he regarded me as a medical colleague, EITHER THEORETI­
CALLY  OR PRACTICALLY, he freely spoke his mind after having ausculated 
and percussed me. And to my horror, the  pleurisy  had returned,  even if 
not in so severe a form, being confined to  one spot on the left of  my back; 
bronchitis, on the other hand, pretty well —  chronic'.  He thought that 
1 or 2 vésicatoires c might put paid to the thing (pleurésie); during 
9 May (Mardi) r first  vésicatoire,  on 13 May (Samedi) g only my 2nd visit 
to Kunemann, second  vésicatoire  prescribed; could not be applied until

épanchement*  in particular being reduced to almost nothing; he sug­
gested (these doctors are always afraid that their patient will grow 
restive, the whole of this week having been plus ou moins b ruined and 
tormented) that to continue with  vésicatoires  was no longer essential; 
I need do no more than embrocate with TINCTURE  OF iodine (prescribed 
by Stephann for bronchial trouble), this time the upper as well as the 
lower places on my left side, chest and back. I thereupon declared 
that, if the  épanchement  had not altogether disappeared, I would, on 
the contrary, prefer another  vésicatoire  (on 23 May, Mardi); I had, 
I said, been told by Dr Stephann that in cases of pleurisy tincture of 
iodine was an ineffectual, uncertain antidote which only served to 
prolong the trouble. My plumping for the heroic remedy was ob­
viously far more agreeable to Dr Kunemann  himself;  I now hope 
that, on 26 or 27 May, he will [tell] me this 2nd rechute' is the FINAL 
one (pro nunc*). 
Indeed, as regards [myself], 'fate' would seem on this occasion to 
have displayed an alarming consistency — almost, one might say, as 
in Dr Müllner's tragedies. 320 Why does Dr Kunemann declare my 
bronchial condition (and I already knew I would be told as much) to 
be thus 'chronic'? Because the weather throughout the Riviera has 
been so exceptionally bad, has taken such an abnormal turn; but he 
suggested that this might be normal to the extent that from January to 
the beginning of May, there had been too little rain — virtually none; 
the weather had been too warm and fine and a reaction to it must 
have set in. I explained this to him more simply by pointing out that 
all this must be blamed on my arrival from Algiers; I had brought 
rain with me to Marseilles on the 4th May and, with some reluc­
tance, the weather in the place of my present abode had —  mutatis 
mutandis' — assumed the character of the 'bad weather' I had 
recently gone through in Algeria. Much patience is demanded, 
especially on the part of the recipients of my letters. Such repeti-
tiveness is altogether too boring. A pointless, arid, not to say expen­
sive,  existence! 
Tomorrow I shall write to Tussy/ since her unanswered letter 
dates back furthest. Today it's awkward for me since the new skin 
formed after the  vésicatoire  still tends, when I stoop, to rub painfully 
against my coat or shirt.  Notabene:  What I write and tell the children

Your being my oldest creditor, I had in fact intended writing to­

Riviera enjoyed a summer weather never so brilliant, some grumblers 
a man proposes but the thermometer disposes. Today is a wonderfully fine day, but it's

only complaining of an absolute lack of rain almost. The moment 
I arrived on the 4th May at Marseille, there set in rain, lasting some­
times a whole, more generally a half day, and mostly during the 
nights; a general lowering of temperature; then and there cold winds; 
altogether changeable, variable weather; atmosphere, even if not of­
ten, too saturated with aqueous vapours. With all that, here a rela­
tively good warm  weather,  only not so dry and more constant than I want 
just now for my lungs. But nowhere in Italy or elsewhere you will find 
it a better one now: Cannes, Monte Carlo and Mentone are the three

Today 24 degrees in the shade, and summer temperatures have 
generally prevailed here ever since the date of my last postcard to 
you3 (although the sky isn't as completely cloudless as the  cognoscenti 
of this place demand). In such circumstances, my lengthy report has 
come to nothing for all my 'good intentions'; not that anything of 
much value is lost thereby. 
As regards the sea-crossing from Algiers, nothing need be said save 
that it was made in unfavourable weather conditions; during the 
night of 4 to 5 May, in particular, there was a violent storm that 
turned my cabin (which, for good measure, I had to share with a phi-
listine businessman from Lyons) into a veritable wind tunnel. It was 
cold and pouring with rain when we arrived off Marseilles in the 
early morning (5 May). The STEAMER didn't actually go right in, so the 
passengers and baggage had to be taken off by boat and, for their 
further delectation, spend several hours in a cold, draughty  douane-
purgatorioh  until the time came for them to depart for Nice. Those 
chilling 'moments'  détraquaient  plus ou moins de nouveau ma machine^ 
and, in Monte Carlo, once more precipitated me entre les mains d'un 
Esculape A; for I have no need of such when it's merely a question of 
treating the 'bronchial trouble' since all I have to do is follow 
Dr Stephann's instructions. In a few days' time (next Tuesday, 
30 May, perhaps) I expect to be given a clean bill of health by 
Dr Kunemann. So whatever happens I shan't be leaving this den of 
thieves before the beginning of  June.  Whether I stay on or not is for 
Dr Kunemann to decide. The sensitivity of people suffering from 
disorders of the respiratory organs (who by the same token are also 
more liable to a relapse) is greater in what is normally a favourable 
climate. In the North, for instance, a sudden draught would not 
instantly evoke the spectre of pleurisy, bronchitis and the like, 
whereas in Algiers your French philistine must always [be] on his 
guard against them. A Madame Fleury, here in the Hôtel de Russie, 
was sent to Cannes from Paris because of her bronchitis. She recove­
red completely during March and April, enjoyed climbing the hills, 
etc. By way of an after-cure and distraction, she then left Cannes for 
Monte Carlo, a quite short 2-hour journey during which she caught 
cold while in Antibes station — and is now in worse case than 
previously in Paris. One hears of visitors to this place who haven't

come simply to gamble and enjoy themselves, and of whom 9 out of 
every 10 undoubtedly fall victim to  'rechutes'.* 
Goethe, when he applauds a man for 'sloughing' his old snake's 
skin,11  does not in all likelihood see the sloughing of artificially 
produced 'fausses peaux' c as part of the rejuvenation process. 
Another time, when it isn't as 'sweltering' as it is today, I must 
really tell you something about this Principality of Gerolstein (not even 
Offenbach's music is wanting, or Mademoiselle Schneider, 322 or, in­
deed, the spruce and dapper carabiniers d— not 100 all told). Nature 
here magnificent and art has actually improved on it,— I refer to the 
gardens, conjured out of the barren rock, which cover the steep in­
cline from top to bottom, often going right down to the exquisitely 
blue sea, like the terraces of the hanging gardens of Babylon. But the 
economic basis of Monaco-Gerolstein is the casino; if it were to close 
tomorrow it would be all up with Monaco-Gerolstein — the whole of 
it. I dislike visiting the gaming room; it reminds me that at the table 
d'hôte,' in the cafés, etc., almost the only topic that is talked or whis­
pered about is the  tables de roulette  et de trente  et quarante. 1 Every now and 
again something is won, as for instance 100 frs by a young Russian 
lady (wife of a Russian diplomat-cum-agent) (she is one of the guests 
at the Hôtel de Russie) who, in return, loses 6,000 frs, while someone 
else can't keep enough for the journey home; others gamble away the 
whole of large family fortunes; very few take away a share of the plun­
der— few of the gamblers, I mean, and those that do are almost with­
out exception rich. There can be no question of intelligence or calcu­
lation here; no one can count with any probability on being favoured 
by 'chance' unless he can venture a considerable sum. But I can 
understand the attraction it holds out, particularly for le beau sexe e; 
les mondaines h not less than the  demi-mondaines,  SCHOOL-GIRLS and bour­
geoises alike ALL PUSH ON, a fact to which this place can supply eye­
witnesses and to spare. Apart from Monaco-Gerolstein, which would 
founder along with the casino, I don't believe that Nice — the ren­
dez-vous in the winter months of the quality and of fortune-hunters 
alike — could continue to subsist as a fashionable centre without the 
casino at Monte Carlo. And withal, how childish is the casino by 
comparison with the Bourse!

(This pen and this ink need replacing; they elicit from me the out­
burst that it requires real artistry to write with them!) 
To the right of the casino (where the gambling goes on), almost 
cheek by jowl with it, is the Café de Paris and next to that a kiosk. 
This is daily adorned with a placard, not printed, but handwritten 
and signed with the initials of the quill-pusher; for 600 frs he will pro­
vide,  in black and white, the secret of the science of winning a million 
francs with a 1,000 at the  tables de roulette  et de trente-et-quarante.  Nor, or 
so it is said, is it by any means rare for people to fall victim to this 
confidence trick. Indeed, most of the gamblers, both male and fe­
male, believe there is a science in what are pure games of chance; the 
ladies and gentlemen sit outside the said Café de Paris,  IN FRONT  of, or 
on the seats in, the wonderful garden that belongs to the casino, heads 
bent over little (printed) tables, scribbling and doing sums, while one 
of them may earnestly expound to another 'what system' he prefers, 
whether one should play in 'series', etc., etc. It's like watching 
a bunch of lunatics. However, Grimaldi of Monaco 8 and his Princi­
pality of Gerolstein and the lessees of his casino are thriving and are, 
AFTER ALL, more 'interesting' in the Offenbachian sense than those 
whom they fleece. 
Should I change my address, / shall send it to you by  telegraph.  At all 
events the return journey, initially to Paris, will be made in stages 
and 'with caution'.

MARX TO ENGELS 72 
IN LONDON 
[Monte Carlo,] 30 May 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
After the application (the 3rd in Monte Carlo) of a vésicatoire*  on 23 
May I did in fact have another appointment with Dr Kunemann 
before today, but only in connection with my 'bronchial trouble'. 
Quo-ad b my pleurésie, however, he found today, after a lengthy final 
examination, that the épanchement c was 'gone'; what remains is 
so-called dry pleurésie; there is no longer any moisture to retard 
matters; however the sound of one membrane rubbing against the 
other, to put it in popular if incorrect terms, still remains. He thought 
it would be beneficial to finish up with one more  vésicatoire  today and 
then move on to Cannes for a day or two, after which I would be able 
to take myself off to Paris. 
He thought I had contracted pleurisy quite accidentally; consider­
ing my normal, robust physique I might just as well never have got it, 
or, by the same token, have done so — accidentally! — as much as 40 
years ago. Getting rid of it is harder because of the danger of a re­
lapse. 
As I was made to parade my naked charms, front and back, he 
drew my attention to the fact that, previously, as a result of pleurisy, 
my left side had swollen by comparison with the right; now it was the 
other way round, for my left side (I refer to the affected spot) had 
contracted by contrast with the right, this being the result of my trai­
tement* So as to rid myself completely of the last mementoes, as it 
were, of pleurisy, I am to spend some time later on in the mountains 
where the air is more rarified. My lungs must be 'set to rights' again 
by gymnastics of this kind, gymnastics imposed upon them by the 
locality. It was all the more difficult for me to follow the details in 
that he sought to bring them (the details) home to me in French

Dr Stephann had told me on the first day: Your thorax is what it is, so 
if spurious tissue takes up some of the space that one lung should 
occupy, that lung must make do with less space. The said tissue disap­
pears in proportion as the lung re-expands. I have only just left 
Dr Kunemann, i. e. it's now nearly 6 o'clock in the evening which 
(6 o'clock) is the latest posting time  FOR  TO-DAY.  Tomorrow  — because of 
the final  vésicatoire  to be applied tonight — writing will be  OUT  OF THE 
QUESTION; day after tomorrow I shall have to recuperate and so it's 
'unlikely' that you'll get any further news before the 2nd or 3rd of 
June (as I shall also have to pack). 
With best wishes.

Dearest Child, 
I'll come at some of  the first days of  the week  beginning  on the 6th June. 
I cannot specify; it will depend on circumstance not to be exactly 
foreseen. Hence you  oblige  me greatly by not bothering about the exact 
day or hour of arrival. Till now, I have always found that  nothing  has 
done me more harm than people, at the station, waiting for me. Do not 
tell anybody else (ci-inclus le Gascon, le Russe et le Hirsch) b that 
I am expected that week. I'll want some absolute quietness  alone  with 
your family, No. 11, Boulevard Thiers. 
Yours,

Cannes, 5 Juin" 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
ON 30TH MAY  {pro  Monte Carlo) my back last branded; on 31  ST MAY 
post-operative treatment confined me to the house; on 3rd June I was 
set free by Kunemann and left the same day. He advised me to stay in 
Cannes for a couple of  days,  whatever the circumstances,323 this be­
ing essential if only to allow the wounds inflicted on me to 'dry out'. 
Thus I have spent an entire month vegetating in this  repaire b of aris­
tocratic idlers or ADVENTURERS. Nature superb, in other respects 
a dreary hole; it is 'monumental' because consisting solely of hotels; 
no plebeian 'masses' here, apart from the  garçons  d'hôtels, de café, etc., 
and domestiques,' who belong to the  Lumpenproletariat.  The old rob­
ber's lair on its rocky promontory surrounded on 3 sides by the bay, 
i. e. Monaco, was at least an ancient, crumbling, medieval sort of 
Italian townlet; on the other hand,  Condamine,  built for the most part 
low down by the sea, between the 'town' of Monaco and the  maison  de 
jeu6 (i. e.Monte Carlo), and growing fast. Monaco is, IN THE STRICT SENSE, 
a June -b haunt -c  waiters in hotels and cafés etc., and servants - d gaming estab­
lishment

the 'polity', the 'state', the 'government'; Condamine is common-
or-garden 'petty-bourgeois' society; but Monte Carlo is 'THEPLEASURE', 
AND,  THANKS  TO THE banque  de jeu," THE FINANCIAL  BASIS  OF THE  WHOLE  TRINITY. 
Odd that these Grimaldis should have turned out to be what they 
have always been; formerly, they lived off piracy and one of them, b 
F.I.,C wrote to Lorenzo dei Medici saying their territory was very re­
stricted and, moreover, barren; hence Nature had pointed the way to 
buccaneering; it would therefore be magnanimous on Lorenzo's part, 
since they did not 'venture' to hunt down Florentine vessels, if he 
were to guarantee them an annual 'gratuity'. CONSEQUENTLY Lorenzo 
paid them a small annual  fee.—  After the HOLY ALLIANCE'S 266  victory 
over Napoleon, Talleyrand, who, for his own diversion, had selected 
from amongst the émigrés that arch-blackguard, the ex-tyrant of 
Monaco, d to be one of the companions — Talleyrand, then, thought it 
amusing to 'restore' him, the father of'Florestan',e  'au nom  du principe 
de le légitimité'.' The restoration of these 2 men, this COUPLE — him of 
Hesse-Cassel g and him of Monaco —  is worthy of a place in a new edi­
tion of Plutarchh; at the same time, what a contrast between the Ger­
man 'patriarch' and the Genoese (his main preoccupation, financial 
loot)! 
A grievance nursed in private by our Dr Kunemann is that, when 
already functioning as physician in ordinary to His Most Serene 
Highness, the present Charles III (blind as a bat), he (Kunemann) 
became unacceptable as a result of his liberal principles and had to 
make way for an Englishman (Dr Pickering). THE SURVIVAL OF THE 
BEST — i. e. as a little duodecimo tyrant's physician in ordinary — *to 
a Britisher, of course, warranted by the nature of the beast! And that 
is the worst; this same Dr Pickering, before being called by natural se­
lection, he had dangerously fallen ill at Monaco, was treated and 
cured by* Dr Kunemann. There are many such piteous dramas of 
destiny in this world of ours! 
Oddly enough, this hot weather has made my bronchial cough 
worse rather than better. All the greater 'pretext', of course, for 
catching cold! Kunemann, by the by, (and the fellow's a first-rate 
doctor, familiar with English, German and French medical litera­
ture,  a specialist in diseases of the chest and lungs) is not of your

opinion regarding my journey back to Paris. I ought not, he says, to 
make it by easy stages; the weather is now hot and not only during 
the day, the nights, too, being warm. The most likely place to catch 
cold now, he avers, is at railway stations and the more often I break 
the journey, the greater the probability of  rechutes*;  rather, I ought, 
while in Cannes, to equip myself for the journey with 2 bottles of good 
old claret. Like Dr Stephann, he bases his view on the grounds that, 
in the treatment of pleurisy like that of bronchitis, etc., the stomach 
should be treated as the basis; eat well and amply even if it goes 
against the grain, and 'accustom' oneself to so doing; 'drink' 'decent 
stuff and go for drives, etc., to distract  oneself,  if not allowed to walk, 
climb,  etc., much; think as little as possible, etc. 
So, having followed these 'directions', I am well on the way to 
'idiocy', and for all that have not rid myself of the bronchial catarrh. 
A consoling thought for me is that it was bronchitis that sent old 
Garibaldi to his 'eternal rest'.324 Of course,  AT A CERTAIN  AGE it be­
comes completely INDIFFERENT how one may be  'LAUNCHED  INTO  ETERNITY'. 
I have been here since  3 June,b  and shall be leaving this evening. In 
Nice and, on this occasion likewise in  Cannes,  where it is exceptional, 
a strong  (if warm.) wind and  eddies  of dust. Nature, too, can evince a cer­
tain philistine humour (after the manner, already humorously anti­
cipated in the Old Testament, of the serpent feeding on dust, cf. the 
dusty diet of Darwin's worms 32S). Similarly, there is a vein of natural 
wit that runs all through the Riviera's local press. On 24 May, for in­
stance, there was a terrible  orage,'  notably at Menton; lightning struck 
close  auprès  de la gare d (of Menton) and tore the sole off a passing phi-
listine's shoe while leaving the rest of the philistine intact. 
With love to all.

I shall not [let] friends know about my presence in Paris until I've

DEAR FRED, 
I thought I should be able to report progress over the past week or 
so. But the temperature fell as soon as I arrived, in fact  one  day after my 
arrival. The weather, therefore, according to what I've'been told by 
Dr Dourlen, as also by his MEDICAL FRIEND 3 in Enghien, won't allow me 
to begin my sulphur treatment yet. In my former condition, during 
the happy time when I could smoke, I should have found the weather 
DELIGHTFUL. True, the sky is overcast more often than not, a bit of rain 
now and again, gusts of wind, not so much summer as late autumn, 
but nice weather for all that, if you're in good health! 
Yesterday — as a result of a note to St Paul the Gascon6 — he came 
to visit me.328 I WAS GLAD  TO SEE HIM. In compliance with my  avis'  he will 
keep silent —  until  further orders — about my presence here. 
I go early to bed, get up late, spend a large part of the day with the 
children and Jennychen and take advantage of every favourable 
moment to go for a short stroll. All things considered I feel better 
than  AT  ANY  TIME in Algiers, Monte Carlo or Cannes. It seems likely 
that the weather too will change for the better here. I shall write you 
a letter as soon as I've made my first trip to Enghien. 
Best wishes to everyone.

I had previously arranged with Engels —as I since explained ver­

(probably in the latter half of  July),  you should  accompany  me. In fact 
I could hardly set forth on this hazardous journey ALONE. SO, you see, 
it's plus ou moins votre devoir  d'accompagner  le vieux de la montagne* 
However, as I shall have to stay here for at least another 3 weeks on 
account of the sulphur treatment at Enghien, I trust that Helen0 and

Helen and Tussy in that sense.*

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 330 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 20 June 1882 
Dear Sorge, 
I shall attend to your business affairs within the next few days.331 
I am sending the money for the Egalité to Lafargue, who is in Paris, 
and shall extract a receipt from him, however irregular the form it 
may take. As regards The Labour Standard you'll lose nothing if I only 
arrange for the subscription to run from  1 July; the paper gets more 
pitiful all the time. 
Marx was in Algiers for approx. 2 months where, as I think I told 
you,a  he had a relapse of PLEURISY; having been cured of it, he went to 
Monte Carlo in Monaco and had another but milder one. He left 
there for Paris approx. 3 weeks ago and is now staying with his 
daughter, Madame Longuet, in Argenteuil near Paris whence he 
travels daily to Enghien to avail himself of the local sulphur springs 
for his chronic bronchial catarrh and cough. His general state of 
health is very good; as to his further MOVEMENTS, that depends entirely 
upon the doctors. 
The English translation of the Manifesto we have been sent is 
quite unpublishable without total revision. But you will realise that 
anything of the kind is inconceivable under present circum­
stances. 
I have not seen or heard anything of  Leo b for months. He's a pecu­
liar cove who must be allowed to go his own way. I have not even got 
his address. Apropos, for some time I have been receiving communi­
cations for Leo from Dr Lilienthal in New York, which I can only 
deal with via Paris. Who is this Lilienthal? 
The Lassalleans' thrustfulness after their arrival in America was in­
evitable. People who carried the one true gospel in their pack could 
hardly have behaved with less pretentiousness towards those Ameri­
cans still languishing in spiritual darkness. Moreover it was for them 
to find new ground in America to replace that which was being in-

creasingly cut from under their feet in Germany. By way of return we 
are happily rid of them in Germany; in America, where everything 
proceeds ten times as quickly, they'll soon be bested. 
I trust your eyes will improve through being spared. I too 
had something of the sort once and know what a vile business 
it is. 
In Germany things are going splendidly on the whole. It is true 
that the literary gentlemen in the party have tried to bring about 
a change of front, at once reactionary, bourgeois, tame and cultured, 
but it has proved a resounding failure. The infamies to which socialist 
workers everywhere have been subjected have everywhere made 
them much more revolutionary than they were even 3 years ago. You 
will have seen the details in the Sozialdemokrat. Of the leaders, Bebel 
is the man who behaved best over the affair. Liebknecht shilly­
shallied somewhat, for not only did he himself welcome every 'eddi-
cated' semi-social democrat with open arms while failing to run a 
careful eye over him, but his son-in-law, that obese sluggard Bruno 
Geiser, is one of the biggest wallers. 332 Because it makes short 
work of their literary earnings, these people would like to get rid of 
the Anti-Socialist Law '6  at any cost and to do so ignominiously 
by means of moderation and meekness, tameness and toadyism. As 
soon as the law is repealed (not even the bourgeois believe that it 
will be renewed either by the present or some other eventual 
Reichstag, since it has proved totally ineffective), the split will prob­
ably be brought out into the open, whereupon your Vierecks, 
Höchbergs, Geisers, Bloses & Co. will form a separate right wing, 
in which case we shall be able to negotiate with them as occasion 
arises,  until they eventually come to grief for good and all. We 
said as much* immediately after the promulgation of the Anti-
Socialist Law when Höchberg and Schramm published in the 
Jahrbuch 333 what was, under the circumstances, a quite infamous 
assessment of the party's activities up till that date, and demanded 
that the party conduct itself in a more 'eddicated', decorous and 
presentable manner. b

Dear Bebel, 
I shall have to answer your letter from memory, having given it 
to Tussy for forwarding to Marxc since when I have not seen it 
again. 
For the past 3 weeks or so Marx has been staying with his daughterd 
at Argenteuil near Paris, is said to be looking very well, brown as a 
real 'Moor' (this being his nickname, as you know), and in very good 
humour, his only ailment now being a bronchial cough. In order to 
get rid of this he has at last had to do Vogt the favour of becoming 
a member of the Brimstone gang. 334 For he is undergoing a sulphur 
cure at the neighbouring town of Enghien. What further peregrina­
tions he makes is for the doctors to decide.

minded elements in the party and a parting of the ways between right 
and left wings is something about which I have long harboured no il­
lusions and, indeed, had already declared desirable in my hand­
written commentarya  on the Jahrbuch article. That you should have 
come to take the same view can only be most welcome to us. If I did 
not expressly mention the point in my last letter, b it was because I saw 
no immediate necessity for a split of this kind. Were the gentlemen to 
decide of their own free will to form a separate right wing, everything 
would soon be in order. But they are hardly likely to do so; they know 
they would be an army consisting solely of officers without soldiers, 
like the 'Robert Blum column' which came over to us in the 1849 
campaign and insisted on fighting only 'under the command of that 
brave man Willich'. 335 Upon our asking how many effectives went to 
make up this heroic column, we were told — and you can imagine 
our mirth — one colonel, eleven officers, a bugler and two men. On 
top of which the colonel was at great pains to look like a stalwart 
Schinderhannes and had a horse he was unable to ride.— Every one 
of these gentry wants to be a leader, but they can't even act  the part of 
leader except within our party, and so  they  will take good care not to 
provoke a schism. On the other hand they know that, subject as we 
are to the Anti-Socialist Law, ' 6 we too have reasons for avoiding in­
ternal splits which we cannot debate in an open forum. Hence we 
shall have to put up with epistolatory and verbal cabalism and jere­
miads from these people until we are again in a position to thrash out 
inside the country itself and before the workers those points on which 
we differ as to tactics and principles unless, of course, their antics are 
such that our hand is forced. Meanwhile the Anti-Socialist Law will, 
one way or another, shuffle off this mortal coil and, as soon as that's 
been got rid of, the position, or so it seems to me, must be fairly and 
squarely stated; what should be done next will automatically emerge 
from the attitude adopted by these gentry. 
Once they have organised a separate right wing we shall be able, 
as and when occasion arises and in so far as it is admissible, to come to 
an agreement with them as to common action, or even enter into 
a compact with them, etc. Although this is unlikely to be necessary: 
the schism itself will lay bare their impotence. They have neither 
adherents amongst the masses, nor talent, nor knowledge — all

they have is pretensions, and those in plenty. However, we shall 
have to wait and see. Whatever happens, it will serve to elucidate the 
situation and we shall be rid of an element that in no way belongs 
to us. 
There is no need to fear that, in such a case, we shall no longer 
have any presentable candidates for the Reichstag. That is a pure fig­
ment. If a working man in the Reichstag now and then says I when 
he ought to say me, all we need ask is how long the Hohenzollerns, 
let alone field marshals, have been able to distinguish between I and 
me. Frederick William III and his adored Louise perpetrated 
more howlers in the matter of I and me than did even A. Kapell. 
And if Bismarck isn't afraid of appointing to his economics council 
workers who speak ungrammatically, but vote grammatically, can 
we afford to jib? But I know that to many it's an abomination. To 
us not in the least. And it would put an end to the utterly senseless 
practice of our deputies, which is supposed to be 'democratic' but 
isn't, whereby every man must speak in turn. How could any party 
possess as many good parliamentary speakers as that, and what is 
supposed to happen when there are, say, 200 of our men in the 
Reichstag? 
But of one thing you may be sure: When it comes to a show-down 
with these gentry and the party's left wing declares  itself,  we shall go 
along with you whatever the circumstances, and do so actively and 
with our visors up. If I did not contribute to the  Sozialdemokrat  in my 
own name before, 336 this was due solely to the influence so long exert­
ed upon the paper by these people and the prolonged absence of any 
guarantee that they would not regain it. 
As you know, there's a split in the workers' party in Paris. The 
Egalité people (our best, Guesde, Deville, Lafargue, etc.) were uncere­
moniously thrown out by those on the Prolétaire (Malon, Brousse, 
etc.) at the recent congress of the Centre of France. The Sozialdemo­
krat rightly censured this procedure in a passage which the Égalité 
translated. Thereupon the Prolétaire replied, saying that its own 
point of view concerning this matter had been put to the German 
party leadership with whom it had since been in complete accord. 337 
Do you know anything about this? The  Prolétaire  people are the most 
egregious liars; but on the other hand I recall all too many instances 
of stupendous blunders perpetrated in the Leipzig Volksstaat and 
Vorwärts  in regard to French affairs and persons. Can you tell me any­
thing about what actually happened? I shall try and let you have the

cutting from the Prolétaire. Malon, Brousse & Co. are finding their 
labours as workers' candidates unduly tedious and are therefore con­
sorting with sundry radical bourgeois and literati, and inviting others 
of that ilk to join forces with them; they imagine that they will 
thereby get themselves elected more quickly. They are fighting 
the Egalité with the same old infamous weapons used by the Baku-
ninists.

DEAR FRED, 
I got the  REGISTERED  LETTER  yesterday; today I realised it in Paris. As 
a result of the present changeable weather I had an attack of muscu­
lar rheumatism in the region of my hips; as a result of this and other 
things a sleepless night from the 22nd to the 23rd on account of severe 
pain. No food the next day (though absolved my sulphur inhalation 
at Enghien yesterday); Dourlen called in the evening and helped by 
embrocating me with laudanum; ALL RIGHT now as regards this IN­
CIDENT, except that slight twinges of muscular rheumatism still persist. 
As regards Enghien the first question to be answered — for this 
depends upon the individual —  is whether the local sulphur spring is 
a residue-b  Demuth-" A slip of the pen in the ms.: Marx probably means his

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 339 
IN ZURICH 
[London, 26 June 1882] 
...In Ireland there are two tendencies within the movement, the 
first and earliest being the agrarian. Out of organised brigandage, 
backed by the farmers, on the part of the clan chiefs whom the 
English had dispossessed, and the big Catholic landowners (in the 17th 
century these brigands were called Tories, a name that has descended 
by direct line to the Tories of today), there gradually evolved an indi­
genous resistance, organised according to locality and province, on 
the part of the farmers against the interloping English landlords. The 
names — RIBBONMEN, WHITEBOYS, CAPTAIN ROCK, CAPTAIN MOONLIGHT,340

etc.—  have changed, the form the resistance has taken — the shoot­
ing, not only of hated LANDLORDS and agents (collectors in the LAND­
LORDS'  service), but also of those farmers who take over a farm from 
others who have been forcibly evicted,— BOYCOTTING, threatening let­
ters, nocturnal attacks with intimidation, etc.— all this has been go­
ing on for as long as the English have owned land in Ireland, i. e. at 
least since the end of the 17th century. This form of resistance is irre­
pressible, cannot be curbed by force and will disappear only with its 
causes. But by its nature it is local and sporadic, nor can it ever 
become a general form of political struggle. 
The period immediately after the Union (1800) 109 saw the begin­
nings of the liberal-national opposition of the urban  bourgeoisie  who, 
as in every agrarian country with small towns in process of decay 
(e.g. Denmark), found their natural leaders in the lawyers. The lat­
ter also need the farmers; hence they have to invent slogans to attract 
the farmers. Thus O'Connell lit, first, upon Catholic emancipation,3*1 
and then upon the Repeal of the Union. Latterly supporters of this 
trend have been forced by the infamies of the landowners to adopt 
a different course. Whereas, in the social sphere, the Land League 139 
pursues more revolutionary (and in this instance attainable) aims, 
namely the total elimination of the interloping LANDLORDS, its politi­
cal posture is, if anything, rather tame since its only demand is HOME-
RULE,  i. e. a local Irish parliament alongside and subject to the parlia­
ment of the Empire. This, too, is undoubtedly attainable by constitu­
tional means. The frightened landlords are already clamouring for 
(and the Tories themselves proposing) the speediest possible redemp­
tion of farmland in order to save what can still be saved, while 
Gladstone,  for his part, is declaring a greater measure of self-govern­
ment for Ireland to be altogether admissible. 
After the American Civil War these two tendencies were infiltrated 
by a third — Fenianism.3 '2 The hundreds of thousands of Irish soldiers 
and officers who fought in that war did so with the ulterior motive of 
building up an army for the liberation of Ireland. The dissension be­
tween England and America after the war became the Fenians' prin­
cipal lever. Should war supervene, Ireland would, within a few 
months, be either a member of the United States or a republic under 
the latter's protection. The sum which England so willingly under­
took to pay and did pay during the Alabama negotiations with the 
Geneva arbitrators342 was the price at which American  intervention  in 
Ireland was bought off. 

=====第315页=====
160. Engels to Bernstein.  26 June 1882 287 
As from that moment, the principal danger was eliminated. The 
police were enough to keep the Fenians in order. In this they were 
helped by the betrayals inseparable from any conspiracy, and yet it 
was only the leaders who betrayed, going on to become downright 
spies and falsifiers of evidence. The leaders who got away to America 
indulged in émigré revolutionary politics there and, for the most part, 
went to seed like O'Donovan Rossa. All of this — if, of course, on an 
exaggerated American scale — will seem very familiar to anyone who 
witnessed the European emigration over here between 1849 and 
1852. 
There can be no doubt that many Fenians have now come home 
again and have revived the former armed organisation. They provide 
an important impulse within the movement and compel the liberals 
to adopt a more resolute posture. But otherwise they achieve nothing 
unless it be to frighten John Bull. True, the latter is growing percepti­
bly weaker on the periphery of  his empire, but as close to home as this 
he is still in a position to suppress with ease any kind of Irish rebellion. 
For a start there is, in Ireland, a permanent 'CONSTABULARY' 14,000 
strong, equipped with rifles and bayonets and having had a military 
training. Then some 30,000 line troops who could easily be reinforced 
by an equal number of line and English militia. In addition, the 
navy. And in suppressing rebellion, John Bull's brutality is without 
equal. In the  absence  of a foreign war or the threat  thereof,  an Irish uprising 
has not the  remotest prospect  of success;  and here only two powers might 
constitute a threat —  France  and, to a far greater degree, the United 
States. France is out of the question. In America the parties are co­
quetting with the Irish vote; they make many promises but abide by 
none. Nor have they any intention of involving themselves in a war 
on Ireland's  behalf.  It even serves their interests that conditions in 
Ireland should be such as to encourage massive Irish emigration to 
America. And it is understandable that a country which, in 20 years' 
time,  will be the most populous, wealthy and powerful in the world, 
should feel small inclination to rush headlong into adventures which 
could and would upset its gigantic internal development. In 20 years' 
time it will have completely changed its tune. 
But should the danger of a war with America arise, England would 
give the Irish anything they asked, and with both hands — saving 
only complete independence which, in view of that country's geo­
graphical position, is not at all desirable. 
Accordingly the only recourse remaining to the Irish is the consti-

tutional method of gradual conquest, whereby one position is taken 
after another; and here the lurking presence of armed Fenian conspi­
racy can still furnish a most effective element. But these very Fenians 
are being increasingly impelled into a kind of Bakuninism; the only 
purpose to be served by the assassination of Burke and Cavendish was 
the frustration of the compromise between the Land League and 
Gladstone. In the circumstances, however, that compromise would 
have been the best thing for Ireland. Because of rent arrears the LAND­
LORDS are evicting the tenants from house and home in their tens of 
thousands and are doing so under the protection of the military. To 
check this systematic depopulation of Ireland (those who are evicted 
either starve to death or have to go to America) is the prime necessity 
just now. Gladstone is prepared to table a Bill whereby arrears will be 
paid on lines similar to the redemption of feudal taxes in Austria in 
1848 — one-third by the farmer, one-third by the state, one-third 
written off by the LANDLORDS. That is the Land League's own proposal. 
Thus the 'heroic deed' of Phoenix Park appears to be, if not  " sheer 
folly, at all events a piece of pure Bakuninist, histrionic, senseless 
''propagande par lefait\ b If its consequences have not been the same as 
those of the similar follies perpetrated by Hödel and Nobiling, 12° this 
has been due solely to the fact that Ireland does not, as yet, lie within 
the purlieus of Prussia. Hence it must be left to the Bakuninists and 
Mostians to place such puerilities on a par with the execution of 
Alexander II, and to pose the threat of an 'Irish revolution' that 
never happens. 
One more thing that should be noted about Ireland: never praise 
an Irishman — politician — unconditionally or give him your un­
qualified support, until he's dead. Celtic blood and the habitual ex­
ploitation of the farmers (after all, in Ireland this constitutes the sole 
livelihood of all the 'educated' classes, and of the lawyers in particu­
lar) make professional Irish politicians exceedingly prone to corrup­
tion. In return for his agitation, O'Connell got the farmers to pay him 
£30,000 a year no less. When England effected the Union at a cost of 
£1,000,000 in bribes, one of those who had been bribed was re­
proached with having sold his country. Says he: 'Aye, and damned 
glad I was to have a country I could sell.' 
The infamies perpetrated against our people by the German gov­
ernments, police and judges are gradually assuming a character that

makes even the strongest language employed in condemning them 
look insipid. But since language is not necessarily given added em­
phasis by forceful expressions, and the repeated use of the same ex­
pressions such as scoundrel, etc., detracts from the effect, so that one 
has to have recourse to ever more 'forceful' expressions and thus lapse 
into the style of Most-Schneidt,343  it would be desirable to adopt 
a method whereby forcefulness of expression would be assured even in 
the absence of intemperate language. And that method exists; it con­
sists primarily in the use of irony, derision, sarcasm, which have 
a more deadly effect on an opponent than the crudest expressions of 
indignation. I think the Sozialdemokrat would be well advised to 
adopt the old, predominantly  derisive  style whenever this is feasible, as 
indeed was done in the last number. An occasional application of the 
cudgel would then be all the more effective. Bebel is also in complete 
agreement with me here. And, besides, your present correspondents 
already attend pretty adequately to lurid descriptions of events. 
In response to the Egalité's translation of the passage in the 
Sozialdemokrat about the expulsion of their people from the Congrès 
du Centre, the Prolétaire published a pharisaical article about an 
échange  de lettres courtoises entre  le Comité extérieur  du parti  ouvrier  social­
iste allemand  et le  Comité  national français.' 344 Can you tell me anything 
about this? I was quite unaware of the existence of a Comité  extérieur, 
might it perhaps be the much-celebrated  Communications  Office 3*5?

etc. None of which has deterred Lissagaray from informing the  Citqyen's 
proprietor 11 of his desire to join the editorial department! Needless to 
say the editorial department instantly turned him down (this priva­

DEAR FRED, 
Summer did not actually begin until the  1ST  of JULY  (or  RATHER  THE 
SECONDONLY).  Up  till now I've had  2 sulphur baths with douches,  the 3rd 
will be tomorrow; never before have  I encountered anything  as mag­
nificent  as the  shower-bath (alias douche);  one  climbs  out of  the bath 
on to a  slightly raised board,  and  this en 'nature'a ; the  bath attendant 
then manipulates  the  spray (about  the  size of a  fire extinguisher) like 
a virtuoso  his  instrument, dictates  the  movements  of the  corpus  and 
bombards all  PARTS  ofthat corpus in turn  [SAVE  THE HEAD,  (the cranium)) 
for 180  seconds (alias  3 MINUTES)  now  with greater,  now  with lesser 
force, even unto  the  legs and  feet incl.  in an  ever mounting  CRESCENDO. 
As you  will see, there  is little inducement here  for a man to  write.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 
IN ZURICH 
London, 15 July 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I am replying to your last letter straight away as there would 
otherwise be a 3 days' gap on account of the Sunday postal arrange­
ments. 
I was shown the Mehringiad 346  by an acquaintance here and at 
once recognised both author and prompter. Ever since the time his 
plans for the Sozialdemokrat went so completely awry because of the 
presence of yourself and Bebel, Hirsch c has been working himself up 
into a ludicrous rage against the 'Zurich people'. We have often 
a rubber-b great-0  Carl Hirsch

enough given him the broadest hints to the effect that we were not in 
accord with him in this respect; rather, anything he did, he did on his 
own responsibility, but this has helped only to the extent that he 
doesn't pester us with his lamentations. He has, by the way, been 
back in Paris (on sufferance) for some considerable time, and last 
Saturday (8 July) married a certain Miss Lina Haschert. 
As for the actual contents of the thing, there is no reason for us to 
intervene. Mehring has treated the world to so many lies about us 
that, were we to deny just one of them, it would be tantamount to an 
admission that all the rest were true. For years we have let all this 
mendacious tittle-tattle pass unheeded, unless absolute necessity com­
pelled us to reply. Our people have the Volks-^eitung at their disposal, 
so all that is needed is a communication to the effect that an article 
of mine, signed by me, appeared in the Sozialdemokrat of ? June. 3 4 7 
That is the best way to reply. You yourself can, of course, also refer to 
it in the Sozialdemokrat as you intended, and say that Marx and I 
always agree beforehand on any public move we make. I'm very 
glad that the article in the Sozialdemokrat appeared at this precise 
moment; it will knock all these inanities on the head. 
On the other hand I think you would be well advised to leave 
Höchberg out of it. After all, he simply wants to appear as a private 
individual and hence will be able to conduct his own defence if he 
thinks it necessary. I don't know whether it would be doing him a ser­
vice to rake up the old affair of the Jahrbuch article, etc. a — should 
there be doubts within  the party about our position, we might be com­
pelled to revert to it, though I for one think it quite unnecessary. 
Since Marx leads a completely secluded existence in Argenteuil 
and keeps his presence there as secret as possible, he has seen nothing 
of Hirsch, at least so far as I know, nor is he in any way anxious to do 
so. Marx needs peace and quiet, and I shall not therefore bother him 
with all this business before it proves absolutely necessary, i. e. before 
Hirsch forms any further cabals. 
Kautsky has written me one, indeed two, long letters348 about 
everything under the sun. However, as I have already told you,b I no 
longer have the time for such lengthy correspondence and to be able 
to investigate and reply to this or that I should, what's more, actually 
have to embark on specialised studies. That is the whole reason for 
my silence.

ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER 349 
IN NEW YORK 
[Draft] 
London, 25 July 1882 
Dear Mr Hepner, 
My delay in replying has been due to Marx's illness and frequent 
changes of abode. It was not until recently that I was able to corre­
spond with him about business matters. Our viewsa on your projected 
undertaking350 are as follows: 
As you are fully entitled in law to reprint anything that appears in 
Europe, you would, in our opinion, do best to go ahead and exercise 
that right without asking anybody. If you wish to reprint the Com­
munist Manifesto we can have no objection whatever, nor would it 
occur to us to protest against it, provided there were no changes or 
omissions — in any case inadmissible in an historical document — or 
unless compelled to do so by unwarranted notes. We cannot write 
a preface, not only because we are not together, but also, and still 
" Ibid., p. 284.

more, because we should thereby be identifying ourselves to some 
extent with an undertaking which we are not in a position either to 
supervise or to control, nor, indeed, might we wish to do so. As it is, 
you will be entirely at liberty to reprint anything else you wish, with­
out our ever having cause to complain of the company in which our 
works appear. 
The same applies to my  Condition  of the Working  Class.  If you reprint 
it as it stands I can have no objection. Were I, however, to give 
you my special consent, I should be obliged to provide the addenda 
and notes needed to bring the book up to date, and that would be 
6 months' work. Moreover I should require prior guarantees that the 
undertaking, once begun, would be brought to a conclusion. 
I trust I have convinced you that it would be in your best interests 
to go ahead on your own. We shall certainly not place any obstacle in 
the way of the undertaking unless compelled to do so; rather the 
reverse. 
As regards a new abridgement of  Capital,  Marx has had so many 
unpleasant experiences with this kind of thing that no further ap­
proaches should be made to him about the matter, especially not at 
the moment. However {this in confidence) Marx has purged the 
second  edition of Most's abridgement35 ' of its grosser errors and made 
a few addenda, so that this edition is not without its merits and could 
be reprinted. 
Otherwise there is little that I can recommend for reprinting. The 
literature produced by Leipzig consists largely in the socialism of the 
future and doctoral dissertations by parliamentary candidates. Jules 
Guesde's French stuff  is good on the whole, but too closely geared to 
French conditions. Bracke's Nieder mit  den Sozialdemokraten!  is perhaps 
not suitable for America. Bebel's parliamentary speeches are by far 
the best thing that Germany has produced in our line, but they are, of 
course, made for the occasion. Lassalle teems with economic howlers 
and his whole viewpoint was superseded long ago. Bracke's Lassal-
le'scher Vorschlag is a pretty good piece of criticism, though not 
exhaustive. 
Well, it's for you to choose. Wishing your undertaking the best of 
luck, 
Yours, 
F. E.

My dear Lavrov, 
I should have thanked you long since for sending me the Russian 
Manifesto,352 but I couldn't very well write to you without giving you 
news of Marx and he had expressly forbidden me to tell anyone in 
Paris,  no matter whom, that he was in Argenteuil. Unfortunately the 
prohibition of the doctors, who have given him strict instructions to 
talk as little as possible, means he is still in solitary confinement. 
Kovalevsky called while I was out. He only saw Miss Marxa  and 
left no address. He must have departed a few days after his arrival, 
but I have absolutely no idea what route he took. It would seem that 
he intended to return to his own country. Miss Marx is at Argenteuil; 
if you wrote to Longuet, perhaps you might be able to learn more.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN LONDON 
Argenteuil, jeudi, 3 août a 1882 
11 Boulevard Thiers 
DEAR FRED, 
The difficulty over letter-writing is due to the following: at 7.30 
a. m. I start off by washing and dressing  myself,  taking early morning 
coffee, etc.; at 8.30 a. m. departure for Enghien, not as a rule return­
ing before noon, then  déjeuner  en famille'' at Argenteuil; from 2-4 p. m., 
rest, then a walk and pottering about with the children with conse­
quences more detrimental to one's faculties of sight and hearing (let 
alone thought) than were ever experienced even by the Hegel of the 
Phänomenologie; finally, at 8 p. m., evening SUPPER, thereby concluding 
the day's work. So when would one find time for correspondence? 
Tussychen is being of enormous help to Jennychen, nor could her 
stay here really be considered as a rest cure if she were not so fond of 
the children' and of poor Jennychen and evincing in these particular 
circumstances qualities which lie dormant in London. Tussy and 
Laura have not seen one another yet and aren't exactly longing to do 
so. But for decency's sake they will have to meet at least once while 
I am here. 
Now for a health bulletin. My cure began on  17 June. The weather 
up till now has been so far below the average for summer (French) 
that the season which starts in June in Enghien is regarded as a FAIL­
URE by the  établissement  thermal d and something 'better' is looked for 
in August and September. Constant changes of temperature, the sky 
often heavily overcast,  particularly  in the  mornings  after rain and  orages,' 
violent winds, moisture-laden atmosphere and hence often  une chaleur 
lourde/ alias London's 'CLOSE' STATUS. The French have been at pains 
to stave off an alliance with England 353; by contrast, the English 
climate (I MEAN specifically the London climate) would seem to be 
making itself increasingly at home here, in Paris and environs. 
Such is the case this year at any rate. In between times, of course, we

have an occasional fine day, or fragments  thereof.  In these circum­
stances my cure is having to contend with 'agreeable obstacles'. As 
Lenchen will recall, there was one particular day when Dr Feugier's 
examination, and the one undertaken a few hours later by Dr Dour-
len, resulted in the same verdict: the  râlements*  had disappeared and 
this meant the 'bronchial' character of the catarrh had been eliminat­
ed. I didn't pass on 'such matters' to you; I suspected that the said 
bronchial catarrh had by no means croaked its last, and, indeed, dur­
ing a brief spell of bad weather, it began to croak anew. That the 
cough hadn't 'disappeared' (though greatly alleviated, of course), 
I was aware, but didn't much mind about what remained of the 
cough once its character had changed. 
Indeed, upon auscultating me last Monday (31 July), Dr Feugier 
found that the râle was still there, although grown fainter; the 
weather, he said, was especially malign and harmful in the case of 
these particular complaints. As a rule, patients only continue the sul­
phur cure for 3 weeks; indeed, many people cannot tolerate it for 
a longer period without the risk of feverish attacks, etc. In view of my 
otherwise strong constitution and since I am still troubled by a cough, 
especially of a morning, he thought it best to continue the cure until 
the middle  of August, with INHALATION, BATHS, DOUCHES and the drinking of 
sulphurous waters; no purpose would be served by prolonging it 
beyond that date. I shall, of course, follow the doctor's advice. On the 
other hand, however, it will by then probably be too late for the 
Engadine plan 354; both Feugier and Dourlen are afraid that I might 
otherwise expose myself to climatic ADVENTURES which a man, above all 
one in my condition, would do better not to invite unnecessarily.— I 
hope you will in any  case  come and spend a few days here (in which 
case the Lafargues would easily find you accommodation in Paris), 
not only so that we may confer about que faire  après, b but more espe­
cially, you must understand, because I long to see you again after all 
these DAMNED  vésicatoires c and one or two very close shaves! 
Laurachen wrote and told me that Deville is leaving for his home 
town of Tarbes on the evening of  2 August. But since I had expressed 
a desire to see him, Mesa proposed we should come to  déjeuner A with 
him on 2 August, when I should meet, besides the Lafargues, also 
Deville and Guesde. This was the first time that I had agreed to such 
a meeting. (It is always the livelier talk, and/or chatter which tells on

me — after the event.) Went off well. The  Citoyen  people seem to me 
to be succeeding with their public MEETINGS on the Egyptian, etc., 
affaires 355; however, as far as the performance of their paper is con­
cerned, ils laissent beaucoup  à désirer."  Incidentally, and aside from  the self-
styled  socialist  journals, a large and most influential part of the Paris 
press is incomparably more independent than that of London. Despite 
pressure from most of the PROFESSIONAL  POLITICIANS,  despite collusion be­
tween the République  Française,  the Temps and the Journal des Débats, 
working hand-in-glove under the immediate direction of Gambetta; 
despite, what is more, the attempts at bribery by the FINANCIERS 
(Rothschilds, etc.) who have an immediate interest in joining the 
English crusade against Egypt, the Paris press has quashed every at­
tempt (even Freycinet's disguised ones 356) at joint intervention with 
England or with a Quadruple Alliance357 ; without that press, Cle­
menceau would not have won his victory in parliament. But where in 
London is there even a modicum of an 'independent' press? 
I cannot in fact remember where Loria's grandes b opus c is to be 
found in my library; nor would it seem to me worth your while taking 
the trouble to look for it. As you know, after reading the 'opus' (or 
RATHER the first half of the book, for I hadn't the patience to do more 
than skim through the 2nd half containing Mr Loria's fantasies about 
how his ideal norm, small landed property, i. e. smallholdings, could 
adequately  be constructed),  I was far from edified by the sickening covert 
flattery vis-à-vis myself and the overt assumption of 'superiority' not 
to mention falsification of certain of my views the better to refute 
them. Yet, though my first reaction was that I wanted to have no 
truck with him, I allowed myself to become further involved because 
he showed talent, because he had done a lot of swotting; because he 
was a poor devil who had written to me at length about his thirst for 
knowledge; because he was still very young and his admittedly far 
from youthful tendencies — they were, if anything, wise beyond his 
years — seemed understandable in view, partly of conditions in Italy, 
and partly of the school from which he derived; also because he 
sought to make his own, in so far as in him lay and not always with­
out success, the methods of research he had found in Capital. I was 
'amused' and pleased by his way of openly preening himself on hav­
ing 'antiquated' Capital with his 'landed property'. For all that, 
I still harbour serious doubts about the young man's character.

After I had read through these 2 pamphlets,* however, and a couple 
of days after Tussy's arrival here, I gave her my very categorical and 
final verdict — in words — I give you three  guesses!  — in the exactly 
same terms which the said Tussychen was amazed to find again,  word  for 
word,  in your letter of  31 July which I showed her! Thus we, you and 
I, not only came to exactly the same conclusion, but formulated the 
same in exactly the same way\ Such being the case, we can, in future, 
only adopt an attitude of  ironical aloofness  towards him, without in any 
way becoming further involved in the business! He is far worse 
than the Kauzkitten,b who at least has the best of intentions. 
Apropos Hirsch. If he really has collaborated with Mehring, 346 the 
party will never forgive him. Should I see him, I shall ask him point-
blank. Come to that, as regards the controversy over my status, it 
would have been better had nothing been said. What are the workers 
to believe, unless it be that I was, so to speak, shamming sick, and had 
squandered all that time and money without good reason? 
Next week the Lafargues are moving into their proper quarters 
which are said to be very pleasant, and cheap as local logements' go.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 359 
IN ZURICH 
London, 9 August 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Today just a few comments in great haste, as I shall be going to the 
seaside in a few days' time and my hands are absolutely full. 
1. A German edition of  Socialisme  utopique et  socialisme  scientifique is 
something I have long had in mind, particularly now that I have seen 
what a regular revolution the thing has wrought in the minds of 
many of the better people in France. 360 I am glad that we see eye to 
eye here. The only thing is that the German text, because more con­
centrated, is appreciably more difficult than the French from which 
quite a lot is omitted. To popularise the work without prejudice to 
the substance, and in such a way as to make it fit for general use as 
a propaganda pamphlet is a difficult task; however, I shall do the best 
I can at the seaside. When shall you be able to start printing and how 
long will the impression take? I must, of  course,  be sent the proofs (in

duplicate, as in France, which has a number of advantages). 
2. Naturally you would have thought that, in view of our old 
friendship, Liebknecht was really within his rights in asking you to 
hand over my letter a to him, and that you were under an obligation 
to put it at his disposal. I can find nothing to complain about in that. 
Nor could you know that, of the many differences I have had with 
Liebknecht, four-fifths were due to similar high-handed acts on his 
part, to the public misuse of private letters, to notes, etc., on my arti­
cles that were either silly or ran immediately counter to the sense of 
the passage. On this occasion, too, he has made unjustifiable use of 
my letter. That letter was written with specific reference to your arti­
cle. 339 Liebknecht treated it as though it were 'my' account of the 
Irish question as a whole. Frightfully easy and all the more so if one 
trots out in refutation Davitt's speeches which had  not as jet  been made  at 
all at the time the letter was written and, indeed, have no bearing 
at all on that letter, Davitt and his state ownership of land having 
hitherto been no more than a straw in  the wind.  But Liebknecht always 
takes this kind of easy way out when trying to come the 'top dog'. 
Now, I don't begrudge him his fun, but he ought not to misuse my 
letters for the purpose and in this way he has compelled me to request 
you in future (let me try to make this sound as formally diplomatic as 
possible) de lui  donner  — tout au plus — lecture  de mes lettres sans ce­
pendant lui  abandonner  l'original ni lui en laisser  copie}' 
3. I have passed on to Marx, in as humorous a form as possible, the 
substance of the Hirsch-Mehringiad  3 4 6 and I fear that, should little 
Carlc see Marx, he will go through a not altogether agreeable quarter 
of an hour. 
4. I should say that, in the Egyptian affair,355 you take the so-
called National Party rather too much under your wing.36 ' We don't 
know much about Arabi, but I'd wager 10 to 1 that he is a run-
of-the-mill Pasha who begrudges the financial chaps their tax reve­
nue because he would, in good oriental fashion, sooner pocket it him­
self. Here we have the same old story as in all agrarian countries. 
From Ireland to Russia, from Asia Minor to Egypt, the peasant of an 
agrarian country is there to be exploited. It has been the same since 
the time of the Assyrian and Persian empires. The satrap, alias pasha, 
is the eastern prototype of the exploiter, as are the business men and

jurists in the west today. REPUDIATION of the Khedive's362 debts may 
be all right, but the question is, what then? And we West European 
socialists ought not to allow ourselves to be so easily duped as the 
Egyptian fellaheen 363 or as — all Latins. Strange. All Latin revolu­
tionaries lament the fact that their revolutions invariably redound to 
someone else's advantage — quite simply because they have always 
been taken in by the word 'revolution'. And yet it's hardly possible 
for a scrap to break out anywhere without revolutionary Latins rav­
ing about it with one voice — and quite uncritically. As I see it, we 
can perfectly well enter the arena on behalf of the oppressed fellaheen 
without sharing their current illusions (for a peasant population has 
to be fleeced for centuries before it learns from experience), and 
against the brutality of the English without, for all that, espousing the 
cause of those who are currently their military opponents. The ut­
most caution should be observed in making use of the politically emo­
tional French and Italian party papers in all questions of interna­
tional politics; we Germans, however, now we have attained superi­
ority where theory is concerned, are duty bound to preserve it in this 
sphere also by the exercise of criticism. 
But now, enough of criticism. Unfortunately I haven't got suffi­
cient time left today to send you a contribution for the feuilleton. 364 
I am particularly keen to prove to our good little Carl in black and 
white what tremendous piffle it was he fobbed off on Mehring about 
my relations with the Sozialdemokrat. However, you will get it before 
long and may then, if you like — it's all the same to me — make some 
direct allusion to it in a note, without, of  course,  actually mentioning 
our little Carl, who must surely by now be panting for cooling 
streams/ 
Well, my kindest regards. If at all possible, I shall also send you 
a letter from the coast for  ce brave b Kautsky whose address, or such as 
I have, is of somewhat ancient date. The last one was that of some las­
sie with a French name — a genuine  accommodation  address, I trust.

MARX TO ENGELS 72 
IN LONDON 
[Argenteuil,] jeudi," 10 August 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
Next Tuesday Dr Feugier will be letting me know whether I am to 
quit Enghien for good or carry on as I have been doing for another 
day or so. 
Unfortunately I must first — supposing I (and Laura) go from 
here to Switzerland (Vevey or some such place is recommended) — 
have an additional MONETARY SUBSIDY. For I discovered by  chance  that 
Jenny is under severe pressure from her LANDLORD (and it's no laughing 
matter here) for the rent, and today I had the utmost difficulty in get­
ting her to accept enough money to settle the business. 
Furthermore, I am hoping that Johnny will go to London with 
Tussy (the only  opposition  comes from Longuet, who doesn't care a damn 
whether it's a respite for Jennychen or good for Johnny), in which 
case I shall have to give Tussy some extra money to take the lad for 
a couple of weeks to the seaside in England. Monsieur Longuet's 
main objection to letting us have Johnny for six months is that, for 
reasons of health, Johnny ought to go to the seaside in Normandy 
whither he would accordingly be accompanied by Longuet to stay 
with  OLD  Madame Longuet b at Caen. 
In fact, Johnny is running wild here and has, in France, forgotten 
such rudiments of reading, writing, etc., as he had. He has grown 
naughty out of boredom (i. e. [for want of] occupation) and gives 
Jennychen more trouble than the 3 younger ones.' Monsieur Longuet 
does 'nothing' for the child, but his 'love' consists in not letting him 
out of his sight during the brief intervals when he himself is visible, for 
in Argenteuil he usually spends the morning in bed and leaves for 
Paris again at 5 in the afternoon. 
In view of what lies ahead of Jennychen, 365 it will be absolutely 
impossible for him to restrain young Johnny. Tussy is  AN EXCELLENT  DIS­
CIPLINARIAN and will bring him to heel again. So at least we can put

paid to Longuet's 'objection' that Johnny cannot go to England 
(where Tussy would also send him to school) because he must go 'to 
the seaside'; he is to go 'to the seaside', but do so in England. 
Aside from the aforementioned expenses, I shall not, after paying 
the doctor0 and buying various necessities, have very much left for 
the trip from here to Switzerland. I hate squeezing you like this, but 
am forced to do so if I am not to come straight back to London. 
Salut.

The announcement in the French, i. e. Parisian, newspapers, start­
ing with the Temps, that Liebknecht was on his way to Paris, 'to es­
tablish contact with the German workers and visit the socialist, Karl 
Marx, who is now living at Argenteuil after his return from Algiers'," 
this note, I say, and the way it was couched, smacked of the 'police' 
and was too indiscreet even for Liebknecht. If he should still find me 
here,  I shall tell him exactly what I think of his 'indiscretion' (it's all 
due to his wanting to make himself look important).

ENGELS TO EMIL ENGELS Jun. 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
Great Yarmouth, 20 August 1882 
10 Columbia Terrace 
Dear Emil, 
We have been here for the past 10 days,366 Schorlemmer, Pumps, 
BABY3 and I, and the fact that I haven't got round to replying to you 
until today can be blamed on the sweet indolence of a seaside resort. 
First of  all, I have written direct to Sam Moore recommending you 
to him and asking him to send you the address of his office in town (in 
the case of BARRISTERS these are called CHAMBERS), for I haven't got it 
here and during the daytime it is, of course, the only place where he 
can be found. You will find him an exemplary Englishman, possess­
ing all the good qualities of his nation and none of the bad. Needless 
to say he is also a Social Democrat and also speaks German though 
it's a bit rusty. He will be happy to oblige you in any way, provided it 
is in his power to do so, and will be of more use to you than I could 
be. When one has been out of touch with the business world for 
nearly 13 years and with Manchester for  12,367  one no longer has 
much influence over people for whom it is axiomatic that one hand 
washes the other. Moore, on the other hand, has only been out of 
3 Lilian Rosher 

=====第335页=====
171. Engels to Emil Engels Jun. 20 August 1882 307 
touch with it for 3-4 years and still lives in their midst, so in his case 
it's more likely that something can be arranged. I, for example, don't 
even know whether the people I used to be connected with are still 
alive, whether they still own the same business, or whether they may 
not have sold up entirely. To introduce you to Ermen & Roby would 
be far more likely to do harm than good; those chaps certainly 
wouldn't show you their mill and would end up by telling all their 
other spinning and manufacturing acquaintances on the Exchange to 
be on their guard against you. 
You won't get inside any mills making knitting or sewing yarns, be­
cause to my knowledge there are none in Manchester apart from 
Ermen & Roby. There is a variety of DOUBLERS of SEWINGS where all you 
will see are the old doubling machines; they sell the yarn untreated. 
How best to get inside a mill depends upon each particular case; on 
the whole I have always found that it works best if you make a clean 
breast of things to the people you've been otherwise recommended to 
and tell them who you are. To try and get what you want by trickery, 
as many German spinners have done, nearly always leads to your be­
ing found out and denounced to the others on the Exchange, after 
which you never get to see anything at all. People here compete with 
one another on a much grander scale than in Germany and the little 
dodges that are often appropriate enough over there, don't go down 
at all over here. 
Schorlemmer will also be back there at the beginning of October 
and he, too, will be able to help you. More useful to you than any­
thing would be a letter of recommendation from Ermen & Engels 
to a big German commission house who will surely be able to give 
you further help and also tell you in which particular instances it 
might be advisable to keep quiet about what you yourself are. 
Well, that's enough for today. The table is about to be laid. Other­
wise things are going very well here; the fine weather, Pilsener beer, 
sea air and sea-bathing have quite driven away the gastric catarrh 
I had on the Monday of your departure. Pumps and Schorlemmer 
send you their best wishes.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN GREAT YARMOUTH 
Argenteuil, Monday, 21 August 1882 
11 Boulevard Thiers 
DEAR FRED, 
The 'conversion into silver'a  took place the day before yester­
day. 
The week beginning last Mondayb distinguished itself by abomi­
nable weather: rain (at times cold), storms, sultriness; above all wet, 
while a 'water shortage' was 'officially' announced in Paris. Not even 
the Flood would have deterred the bureaucrats here from contriving 
an 'official drought' in respect of water for drinking, washing, domes­
tic and industrial purposes, etc. 
Yesterday, my last perambulation in the salle d'inhalation c and the 
pleasure of a bath and douche at Enghien, where I was also given 
my valedictory examination by Dr Feugier; result: 
1. The bronchial râle much reduced; would have gone completely 
but for my ill-luck with the weather. 
2. The pleuritic frottement d noise remains in status  quo;  an altogether 
predictable circumstance. At best, and this is by no means frequent, 
the after-effects of  pleurésie  may last for years. They are sending me to 
Lake Geneva, whence the weather reports have so far been favour­
able,  since both  doctores "  are of the opinion that the last traces of my 
bronchial catarrh might well depart of their own accord there. Qui 
vivra  verra.'  The season, they say, is too far advanced for respiratory 
gymnastics in the mountains, and I must, above all, avoid the 
cold. 
On this occasion I have been ordered to travel to Switzerland only 
by day and shall therefore have to stay overnight in Dijon and not be­
take myself to my destination until the morrow. They are absolutely 
determined, of course, to obviate any pretext for a 'rechute'. B 
Tussychen left last Wednesday with Johnny; we have had a letter

from her; all went well. She intended to go to Eastbourne with 
Johnny on 19 August (Saturday). Because her pedagogic purposes 
demand above all that to begin with THE YOUNG  MAN  should be solely 
under her supervision, Tussy has chosen a seaside resort where he 
won't find any 'friends'. 
Jennychen is, alas, poorly. What is more, present 'circum­
stances'  3 6 5 make rest and recuperation completely impossible for 
her. 
Laura is ALL RIGHT, leaves with me tomorrow. 
Lissagaray's row with the Brousse gang 368-has had one good result 
in that the latter no longer has a daily paper at its disposal. That dip­
lomat Malon is keeping neutral vis-à-vis Brousse in this affair, since 
he (Malon) could not permit  himself,  vis-à-vis Rochefort, his editor-
en-chef,  to express sympathy for Brousse et cie in the Intransigeant (nor 
does he 'wish' he 'could'). 
Guesde and his party are gaining the upper hand.

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN GREAT YARMOUTH 
Lausanne, 24.August 1882 
Hôtel du Nord 
DEAR  [Fred],a 
Yesterday, on from Dijon to Lausanne, 369 wet and relatively cold. 
Nine o'clock at night arrived at Lausanne in the rain. First ques­
tion I asked the waiter: 'How long has it been raining here?' Reply: 
'Only been wet for 2 days' (i.e. since the day I left Paris).  C'est 
drôle!  b 
Today we shall look round in Vevey, Montreux, etc., for some­
where to stay. In the  meantime  write to Lausanne,  poste  restante.  I should 
like to have a timely supply of extra MUNITION so that some may always 
be available against any and every eventuality. Address letters to 
Dr Charles Marx, not Karl Marx. 
Longuet remained true to his own self till the day of my departure. 
For during both my previous visits to Argenteuil, 370 Longuet kept 
promising the translator of Capital, that poor devil Roy, to arrange 
a meeting with me; on neither occasion was Longuet able to find 
a suitable time. And on this occasion, when Longuet again started to 
maunder on about my meeting Roy, I told him he might arrange it at 
any time during the last 4 weeks. Eh bien! c Not until  the day of my  depar­
ture when I had to pack, pay a farewell call on Dr Dourlen and still 
had a great deal to discuss with Jennychen, etc., does Longuet go off 
to Paris without my prior knowledge, pick up Roy and bring him 
back to  déjeuner A (1 o'clock) in Argenteuil. There was a chilly north­
east wind and, as a result of my obligatory CONVERSATION with POOR 
Roy in the garden, I caught cold. THANKS TO Longuet! 
Apropos. A German who is Paris correspondent to a lot of bour­
geois German newspapers wrote to me as my most humble and obe­
dient servant, saying that, while honesty demanded I should know 
that he was not a Social Democrat, still less correspondent to newspa­
pers ofthat complexion, people in all circles of German 'society' were

Dear Moor, 
Telegram just received 284; a line or two on business in the utmost 
haste. 
Your letter arrived on Monday evening,15  but by then I had sent off 
to Argenteuil the money order received from A. Kayser & Co. on 
Hirsch fils ainé, c Paris, 1,200 frs à présentation.''  The very next day 
I wrote to Jenny, 284 telling her what was in the letter, and asked her 
to make sure it was forwarded. Paying it in from where you are will 
present little difficulty. 
We shall be staying here for another fortnight — it suits everyone 
marvellously, save for Jollymeyer who sometimes gets rheumatism as 
a result of the weather we're having. On Monday' he's off to Ger-
a Johann Philipp Becker- b Presumably a slip of the pen in the original. Engels may

I wish you better weather than we have been having for the past 4

Dear Moor, 
Yourc and Laura's letter arrived from Lausanne this morning, and 
I am using the lull momentarily prevailing in this room to write to 
you. This time it wasn't you who brought on the bad weather, but 
The New York Herald with its forecast of a depression. Whereas Tussy 
was able to attribute the previous bout of wet weather here to your 
undue proximity in Paris, we cannot but observe now that the latest 
change for the worse coincides precisely with your removal farther 
afield, and that on Wednesday eveningd we here were subjected to 
the same violent downpour as were you in Lausanne. This morning,

too, there has been one shower after another, and there's still no sign 
of the 'FINER LATER ON' that was predicted. 
An anathema upon Longuet and his tactlessness. But then, was it 
absolutely necessary, in a cold north-easter, to entertain Roy in the 
garden of all places? 
The Egyptian campaign 355  is off to a good start. The  Kölnische  Lei­
tung goes so far as to maintain that the FORTS of Alexandria were 
silenced in 2 1/2 hours and that the English had continued the bom­
bardment for the remaining 5 hours simply with a view to destroying 
the city.— The rapid occupation of the Canal was nicely done, but as 
soon as I saw that upon embarking Wolseley had ostentatiously pro­
claimed the bombardment of Abukir to be his intention, the whole 
thing became clear to me and I was able to give Schorlemmer an ex­
posé of the whole plan of campaign as presently being carried out. 
Since then I have seen from back numbers of the Kölnische Leitung 
that the plan to march on Cairo via Ismailia had already been com­
mon knowledge in London 10 or 12 days beforehand," so well had the 
secret been kept! The plan itself is still the most rational that could 
have been devised in the circumstances. However its execution won't 
be particularly rapid. Admittedly the clever English have sent field 
guns there, but not horses or mules for the teams. They are presently 
buying up mules in southern Europe and Africa. Ballons captifs* 
essential for reconnaissance in a flat, treeless country, were rejected, 
but are now being sent out  belatedly.  Reconnaissances in force were 
carried out against the fortified Egyptian position before Alexan­
dria — senseless since no one is so stupid as to deploy in strength  before 
a fortified position. The heroism at Shafuir is ludicrous — a five-hour 
engagement and 2 English wounded! Wolseley, who already has 
30,000 men, is now calling for his third division, but this is still in 
process of mobilisation. And when it does arrive he will have barely 
enough in hand, once he has occupied Cairo and Alexandria, to 
clear the Delta and occupy the coastal towns. If Arabi is clever 
enough to parry each main blow and withdraw to Central and/or 
Upper Egypt, the affair could become extremely protracted. Apart 
from the fact that, given a somewhat early rise in the level of the 
Nile,  a breaching of the dams can turn everything to water for the

English. However, it is more than probable that the affair will be 
brought to a conclusion, not by military action, but by diplomatic 
collusion behind the scenes. 
A nice little item: the merits of  RED  TAPE  have been brought to light 
by C. W. Siemens in his capacity as president of the BRITISH ASSOCIA­
TION.372 The metric system was, after all, legalised in England along­
side the existing one some years ago. Moreover authentic copies of the 
original metre and original kilogram were sent for from Paris. But if 
anyone wants to obtain an authentic, standard copy of these units 
from the appropriate authority, the latter informs him that the rele­
vant Act of Parliament neither entitles nor obliges it to provide one. If, 
however, you sell by metres or kgs that have not been authorised by 
the aforementioned authority, that is FRAUDULENT and criminal. So this 
prudent little omission nullifies the whole Act and basta, you're back 
where you started. Moreover, Siemens maintains that, since the in­
troduction of the metric system on the Continent generally, the dam­
age done to English industry by its adherence to the old system has 
been enormous; a great deal of machinery, etc., he says, is no longer 
exportable, because built in conformity with units other than metres 
and kgs. 
I hope that your cough has abated and that you, too, may get some 
better weather at last. Watch out when travelling by steamer. In the 
evenings it is often cold and misty on the water. You'll probably have 
to continue to take care of yourself until the spring and then, when 
you have finally got rid of your bronchitis, some respiratory gymnas­
tics in the mountains will see us round the corner. 
In Vaud there is a splendid wine called Ivorne which I highly re­
commend, especially when it's old. Then they drink Cortaillod, a red 
from Neuchâtel, which has a slight sparkle; the froth forms a star in 
the centre of the glass; also pretty good. Lastly Veltliner (Valtellina), 
the best wine in Switzerland. Besides these the petit" Burgundy, 
Macon and Beaujolais were pretty good in my day 373 and 
not dear. Take heroic draughts of all these varieties and, when 
bored for long spells by your peregrinations, reflect that this is, 
after all, the only way to restore your former verve; though it may 
lie dormant for a little while, the day will come when it will be only 
too necessary to us. My regards to Beckerb  and Wröblewski if you 
see them.

My dear Jenny, 
Many thanks for your letter. I should have been satisfied with 
a postcard. I am glad you opened my letter to Mohr and so took care 
of the contents." 
I had a letter from Lausanneb and a telegram from Vevey3  7 4 with 
their0  new address, Hôtel du Léman, where they seem to be inclined 
to settle down. As to Mohr's health I was really glad to have a cool 
and impartial report from you, Laura who saw him only a few hours, 
reported rather over favorably and Tussy on the other hand, on see­
ing him again at Argenteuil, was rather disappointed that no more 
progress had been made. I am quite of your opinion that we have 
every reason to be content with what progress he has made under the 
very unfavorable weather that has persecuted him so tenaciously, and 
after three pleurisies, two of which were so severe. I never expected 
that he would be able to pass next winter in England, and said so be­
fore he went to Algiers to Helen d and other discreet people. So that is 
no surprise to me; I am only disappointed that he will scarcely be able 
to come over before for a few weeks. Anyhow I am glad that the doc-

tors are so unanimous upon this point, that will make him submit all 
the easier. A little more Enghien or Cauterets for his remnant of bron­
chitis and then a climatic cure on high ground in the Alps or Pyrenees 
will then set him completely up again ready for work. But as you say, 
all this would be upset by a relapse, which, however, is now unlikely 
especially with the experience he has gained. 
My dear Jenny, I know all the fearful troubles you have had to go 
through and are going through even now. My thoughts have been 
often with you and I was sorry I could not find any way in which to 
make myself useful to you. You and Mohr were almost the constant 
subjects of our almost daily conversation when I called in the morn­
ing at Nim'sa  for my Pilsener beer. But I know my brave Jenny will 
not lose heart and when you are over the next trial, b I hope and ex­
pect you will be able to arrange your household in a way that will 
give you some rest and peace. 
You have no idea what a change has come over Pumps since she is 
here.  She occupies herself with nothing but her baby,c dress, amuse­
ments, pleasure trips, everything seems to have gone out of her head. 
And she treats the little one well, with excellent temper and patience, 
but then it is really a very good child, and even now while cutting two 
teeth, almost always laughing. Let us hope mother and child will con­
tinue in the same way. 
Schorlemmer who sends his kindest regards leaves tomorrow for 
Germany, and I shall go to London with him for a day or two to look 
after business. We shall stay here for another fortnight unless driven 
away by the weather which has been exceedingly changeable since 
last Tuesday.d Poor Percy" who came last Wednesday seems to be 
destined to have a wet holiday, a bad lookout for a rheumatic subject. 
As for myself the sea air and bathing is bracing me up famously and 
I expect this winter I shall do some real work. . 
Kind regards from all to Longuet and yourself and children r and 
best love from your affectionately

MARX TO ENGELS '2 
IN LONDON 
[Postcard, unsigned] 
Vevey, 4 September 1882 
Hôtel du Léman 
DEAR FRED, 
Laura will be writing to you at length about events, or rather the 
uneventfulness here, since we are living in the Land of Cockaigne. 374 
Like others, we have been for TRIPS on the LAKE. 
On 3 1ST August I got Jennychen's letter enclosing your letter284 
and the CHEQJJE which last I handed in at the local bank of Genton et 
Co. for encaissement*  in Paris. 
On 31 August, 1ST, 2ND and 3RD SEPTEMBER marvellous weather (too 
hot yesterday). Today wet and stormy; hope it won't degenerate into 
general rain. Odd that I should still be coughing; I think I'm the only 
person in Vevey who coughs; at all events I haven't met anyone else 
who does. My GENERAL STATE, however, is most satisfactory; with Laura 
I climbed not only to the top of the local vineyard, but also to the top 
of the much higher vineyard at Montreux, without feeling the slight­
est discomfort. 
I was called on at our hotel by a  MR Songeon,  président du conseil  mu­
nicipal de Paris b; is one of the réfugiés c whom I knew in London 
in 1849-1850. He presented me with the official report made to 
the conseil municipal of Paris by the deputation (amongst whom 
Mr Songeon) it had sent to Rome for Garibaldi's apotheosis 375; 
the thing is mainly concerned with 'Songeon's' own apotheosis, 
since he always acted as spokesman for the other French delegates. 
Also showed me a copy of  Capital  which is to accompany him to the 
sylvan retreat not far removed from here, whither he was wending 
his way. 
So far the English haven't made such rapid progress in Egypt3  5 5 as 
Wolseley 'prognosticated'. 
Mr Virchow, or so I see from the  supplément  to yesterday's Journal 
de Genève, has again demonstrated that he is far and away above 
a collection-b Chairman of the Municipal Council of Paris-c refugees

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN VEVEY 
London, 12 September 1882 
Dear Moor, 
Postcard2 and Laura's letter received. Am glad to hear you are 
having good weather at last and hope at will continue. We have 
been back here since Saturday; Tussy and Johnny spent a week at 
Yarmouth with us. 
I remember Songeon very well; I often used to wonder what des­
tiny might lie in store for that patronising, bonhomous countenance, 
until I eventually found it in the paper — chairman of the municipal 
council! That, in fact, was what was already written all over his face 
in 1850. 
Many a bill on London from Genton & Co. has passed through my 
hands! 
If you are planning to see something more of Switzerland, you 
could hardly take a better or more convenient route than that from 
Geneva via Berne to Interlaken and Brienz, thence over the Brünig 
Pass (only 3,150 feet up) to Lake Lucerne and, if you feel like it, from 
there to Zurich. It's an easy trip for a convalescent and would take 
a See previous letter.

you to some of the loveliest spots in Switzerland. You could make 
a longish halt at Interlaken and Lucerne or some other place on the 
shores ofthat lake. Morges, on Lake Geneva, is also a pretty spot and 
from it you get the finest view of Mont Blanc. 
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Egyptian affair355 was 
contrived by Russian diplomacy. Now that Gladstone has been  suf­
ficiently soft-sawdered by sweet 01ga,a  he is to be entrusted to a wilier 
mentor for treatment of a more drastic kind. England has got to occupy 
Egypt in the midst of peace so that, in self-defence, poor old Russia 
may thereby be compelled to occupy Armenia, likewise in the midst 
of peace. The Caucasian army has already moved up to the border, 
and there are 48 battalions at Kars alone — a constantly mobile 
army, this. And in order to prove that Gladstone assents to the libera­
tion of yet another 'Christian' country from the yoke of the UNSPEAK­
ABLE TURK, this particular moment has been chosen for the ostentatious 
recall of the English commissions despatched to Asia Minor after the 
Congress of Berlin  3 7 6 to supervise the reforms, and for the publica­
tion of their reports which show that they have been fooled by the 
Turks and that everything remains as before, official corruption be­
ing ineradicable.  Palmerston  est mort,  vive Gladstone!  Vive  Gambetta, h who 
would also have gladly put his seal to the Russian alliance in Egypt. 
Alas,  the good old times are a thing of the past, and Russia no longer 
backs Russian diplomacy, but confronts it. 
I'd be damned glad if I could come over and see you, but were 
anything to happen to me, even temporarily, all our financial ar­
rangements would be thrown out of gear. There's not a soul here to 
whom I could give power of attorney or entrust what are really rather 
complicated cash transactions. Sam Moore would have been the only 
possible man, but he is away and these matters can only be attended 
to on the spot. Besides I had been hoping that you might come over, 
at any rate this summer, if only for a brief  spell.  It was obvious to me 
even before you left England and suffered your relapses that you 
wouldn't be able to spend next winter here, and I said as much to 
Lenchen. Now, having had relapses, it is absolutely essential for you 
to spend a winter that takes the form of spring, and I was glad when 
I heard that Dourlen and Feugier had said so unequivocally, and 
with one voice. Lonely though it is here without you, there's nowt as 
we can do about it, and everything must be subordinated to your

making a complete recovery. But this also demands that finances be 
kept on an even keel, and I therefore consider it my bounden duty 
not to run any risks so long as this remains the case. 
Hartmann" has invented and patented an electric lamp and has 
sold it for £3,000 to a stingy fellow under a no less stingy contract, so 
that it is exceedingly doubtful when and whether he will get his 
money. Meanwhile he has got himself another post — but for how 
long? It's difficult to make head or tail of his perpetual  UPS AND  DOWNS. 
Best thanks for the Algerian presents brought back by Tussy. The 
dagger is genuinely oriental — no grass will grow where it's stuck into 
the ground. I shall have to obtain a stem for the pipe before I can try 
it out. Pumps is very proud of her Arabian bracelets. She is busy fur­
nishing her new house which will probably take her another week. 
Her little girlb came on remarkably at Yarmouth. Johnny has been 
going to infant school since yesterday (in Grafton Terrace, opposite 
your old home).

Dear Mr Kautsky,

nally, in order to get any work done at all, I had to give short shrift to 
Lev Hartmann -b Lilian Rosher

everything of lesser importance and put aside all such correspondence 
as was not absolutely necessary. And since, with your colonial ques­
tion,377 you had set me a task that was by no means easy to tackle, 
your letters met with the same fate, and in the process the good 
Walter got overlooked. 
Should Walter and Dr Braun come over here, I shall be glad to see 
them and whatever can be done for them I will gladly do. As for the 
rest, it will no doubt turn out all right. But what is Walter actually ex­
pected to study over here? That's what needs clearing up first of all. 
Socialism as such? No need for him to come over here for that, since 
it's to be had everywhere save in Austria and Germany; moreover, he 
will quickly exhaust that field, i. e. such literature as is worth reading. 
Economics? History? Of these he will find an  embarras  de richesses a at 
the British Museum — so much so, indeed, that a newcomer runs the 
risk of instantly losing his bearings. Natural science? That would 
mean lectures which are wildly expensive here. It seems to me that, 
before the chap is sent over here, a definite curriculum should be laid 
down for his studies — at least in outline — and if this were sent to 
me, it would be easier to judge whether it could best be carried out in 
this country or somewhere else. Without at least some knowledge of 
English, he would be completely at a loss here. It would, I think, be 
a good idea to get him to study French and English for 6 months be­
forehand, so that he could at least read a modicum of both before he 
went abroad. He should, besides, have some previous knowledge of 
history, geography and, if possible, also mathematics and natural sci­
ence if he wants to study profitably. What the situation is in this re­
spect I cannot know; but if it's at all unsatisfactory, it would certainly 
be better if you first got him to come to Vienna, so that he might ac­
quire these things under the guidance of his friends and generally 
learn exactly how one sets about learning something thoroughly off 
one's own bat. Otherwise, here in London, it would, for the most 
part, be money down the drain. These are simply thoughts that have 
passed through my mind when pondering on the case and which may 
be completely irrelevant, but after all I know little or nothing about 
the young man's level of education, and that is why I considered it 
necessary to raise these points. If you let me know more about this, 
you will not be kept waiting for an answer. All things being equal 
I am, as you know, always in favour of getting ambitious young peo-
a too great a profusion

322 179. Engels to Kautsky. 12 September 1882 
pie to come abroad so that they may extend their horizons and rid 
themselves of the parochial prejudices which they must needs acquire 
at home. 
You should not, by the way, count too much on Marx so far as 
Walter is concerned. He is unlikely to come home before next May, 
and even then he will probably have to take great care of himself if he 
is to get his work completed. In particular he is now strictly forbidden 
to talk overmuch, on top of which he has to spend his evenings quietly 
if he is not to have bad nights. In the daytime, however, he will, of 
course, be working. If one is trying to get rid of chronic bronchitis of 
many years' standing and ensure, after three serious bouts of pleurisy, 
not only that it disappears without trace, but also that it doesn't 
recur, and to do all this in one's sixty-fifth year, one has enough to 
contend with on that account alone. 
You ask me what the English workers think of colonial policy. Well, 
exactly what they think of any policy — the same as what the middle 
classes think. There is, after all, no labour party here, only conserva­
tives and liberal radicals, and the workers cheerfully go snacks in 
England's monopoly of the world market and colonies. As I see it, the 
actual colonies, i. e. the countries occupied by European settlers, such 
as Canada, the Cape, Australia, will all become independent; on the 
other hand, countries that are merely ruled and are inhabited by na­
tives,  such as India, Algeria and the Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish 
possessions, will have to be temporarily taken over by the proletariat 
and guided as rapidly as possible towards independence. How this 
process will develop is difficult to say. India may, indeed very prob­
ably will, start a revolution and, since a proletariat that is effecting its 
own emancipation cannot wage a colonial war, it would have to be 
given its head, which would obviously entail a great deal of destruc­
tion, but after all that sort ofthing is inseparable from any revolution. 
The same thing could also happen elsewhere, say in Algeria or Egypt, 
and would certainly suit us best. We shall have enough on our hands 
at home. Once Europe has been reorganised, and North America, the 
resulting power will be so colossal and the example set will be such 
that the semi-civilised countries will follow suit quite of their own 
accord; their economic needs alone will see to that. What social and 
political phases those countries will then have to traverse before they 
likewise acquire a socialist organisation is something about which I do 
not believe we can profitably speculate at present. Only one thing is 
certain, namely that a victorious proletariat cannot forcibly confer

any boon whatever on another country without undermining its own 
victory in the process. Which does not, of course, in any way preclude 
defensive wars of various kinds. 
This business in Egypt3  5 5 has been contrived by Russian diplo­
macy. Gladstone is to take Egypt (which he is far from having or from 
holding, even if he had it), so that Russia may take Armenia; which 
would, according to Gladstone, be the liberation of another Christian 
country from the Mohammedan yoke. Everything else to do with the 
affair is pretence, humbug, prevarication. Whether the little scheme 
will succeed will soon become apparent. 
With kindest regards.

5 people in one room, including my niecea and her 4-month-old 
baby,b  made it impossible to do anything, and work was dissipated in 
pleasure and the consumption of excellent Pilsener beer. But tomor­
row I go into action, and there'll be no respite until the pamphlet is 
finished. 3'8 
Your suggestion re a preface on Bismarckian socialism is quite all 
right so far as it goes, and up to a point accords with what I myself 
want. But this stuff could not be dealt with in a preface; it would 
make it far too long. Besides, I could do with more material on acci­
dent insurance, etc., especially the proposed legislation, without 
which I cannot manage. 
I have been turning the matter over in my mind for a long time, 
and I can well see that something ought to be written about it. I now 
propose to write (for the Sozialdemokrat) a series of articles (each of 
which would constitute an independent whole) on the kind of bogus 
socialism now proliferating in Germany — a series which could subse­
quently be published in pamphlet form. 379 First part: Bismarckian 
socialism. 1. Protective tariffs. 2. Nationalisation of railways. 3. To­
bacco monopoly. 4. Workmen's insurance. But for this I should have 
to have: 
adc 2, a stock-exchange list giving the prices of the recently national­
ised railways (Berg. Mark., Berlin-Görlitz, Berlin-Stettin, Märkisch-
Posen) shortly  before  nationalisation and, wherever possible, the price 
paid by the state for these railways; 
ad 4, the Bill as submitted to the Reichstag by Bismarck. 
If you can procure these things for me, I shall have sufficient mate­
rial. 
To this, I would, however, append a second part in which I would 
criticise a number of woolly ideas enfranchised by Lassalle and still 
echoed now and again by our people —  e. g. the 'iron law of wages', 289 
'the full return to the  labourer'  (not  labourers)  'for work performed', 380 
etc. To make a clean sweep here is even more necessary than it would 
be in respect of the first part, and if this annoys some of those 
Lassallean 'leaders' who have unfortunately come to be accepted,381 
so much the better. Hence I do in fact regard the second part as the 
more important one. 
On the other hand, there's no knowing whether it mightn't just suit

the book of certain persons if St Ferdinanda  were to be subjected to 
this kind of unbiassed criticism. It might be said, should anything of 
the sort appear in the party organ, that it was an attempt to provoke 
a split in the party and a breach of the long-standing compact with 
the Lassalleans. In which case the whole thing might be brought out 
in pamphlet form as soon as it was finished, without prior publication 
in the Sozialdemokrat. 
So either the whole thing appears in the Sozialdemokrat, and subse­
quently as a pamphlet, 
or it appears straight away as a pamphlet, 
or, for the time being, does not get written at all. 
Voilà mon cas.b  Well, you choose what you would prefer and, if ne­
cessary, consult one or two others. But once something has been 
settled, there must be no going back on it. I cannot expose myself to 
another dose of the unpleasantness occasioned by Most's protests 
against the Diihring. 382 
Incidentally, some very nice preparatory work relating to Bis-
marckery and attendant phenomena has already been done in two 
articles in the Sozialdemokrat on the possible repeal of the Anti-
Socialist Law. 383 I assume they are by Bebel; if not, the party can 
congratulate itself upon possessing another chap who is so splendidly 
capable of getting to the root of the matter and disregarding all 
considerations of a secondary nature, and this in a style at once so 
straightforward and lucid. The articles are first-rate. 
What you say by way of an excuse for the flabbiness of various peo­
ple in Germany is something I have already told myself on more than 
one occasion. Yet again and again we find the same old German want 
of character and backbone, coupled with the urge to play the role — 
vis-à-vis the philistine, not the worker — of a worthy, respectable citi­
zen who is a very far cry from the dangerous ogre he is made out to 
be. These always turn out to be people who consider their modicum 
of education absolutely essential if the worker is not to emancipate 
himself but rather be liberated by them. In their eyes, the emancipa­
tion of the working class is attainable only through your eddicated 
mediocrity; how could the poor, helpless, uneddicated workers hope 
to achieve it on their own account?

MARX TO ENGELS 
IN LONDON 
Vevey, 16 September 1882 
Hôtel du Léman 
DEAR FRED, 
Just as I was about to write to you, the garçon b brought me the 
Journal de Genève  with the news of Bebel's death. c It's frightful — the 
greatest misfortune for our party! He was a unique phenomenon in 
the German (one might say in the 'European') working class. 
Your altruistic concern for me is unbelievable, and I am often 
secretly ashamed — but I won't pursue this theme any further for 
the present. 
My plan, before I left Paris, was AT ALL  EVENTS  to spend at least Octo­
ber in London and to be together with you. Feugier and Dourlen also 
thought there could be no objection to this, should October prove 
passable. It might yet be so, despite September being wet. The ba­
rometer rose here on the 8th, reached the top of the scale on the 9th,

gradually fell right down to the bottom on the 12th, rose again on the 
13th (having reached about the same level as on the 11th), then fell 
and has, since last night, been slowly rising again. Although GENERALLY 
throughout Switzerland there has been heavy rain and storms (many 
landslides and 'ACCIDENTS' resulting therefrom), the weather round 
about Vevey in particular has been relatively good (cold only by way 
of an exception in the mornings and early hours of the evening). This 
is why we have continued to stay here. The air is invigorating. De­
spite perpetual changes of temperature and humidity in the course of 
the same day, my sense of well-being is steadily mounting. My 
catarrh is, I think, no longer bronchial but has turned into the ordi­
nary kind; but I shall not know this for certain until I get to Geneva 
where I shall consult a good German doctor, i. e. get him to auscul­
tate me. But the trip you suggest,a  delightful though it would be, is 
unlikely to be feasible in present Swiss weather conditions. This year's 
vintage would seem to be a 'flop'. Indeed, snow can already be seen 
to be falling—earlier than usual — on the  montagnes  de lab Dent du 
Midi; it's 'REGULAR' on the Jura. 
The Bernese Bund has declared that as a military commander 
Wolseley almost surpasses the old Napoleon. 
There's one snag about the goings-on with the Russiansc; it's quite 
possible that Bismarck would allow them — the last-mentioned — 
to commit themselves, but what we should see next would be 'conso­
lation prizes' for Austria and  COMPENSATION  for the Prussian imperium. 
Thus Russian intervention in Armenia might lead to general war, 
and that is probably what Bismarck wants. 
Apropos! The dagger, as you can no doubt see from the crudeness 
of the workmanship, is of Kabyle 385 origin. As regards the stem for 
the pipe, I brought 3 such — bamboo stems — with me (at the jardin 
d'acclimatation 6 the pipes were provided with only one); I didn't want 
to burden Helen ' and Tussy with these stems which were too long for 
their malles,  ' but was planning to bring them to London  myself. 
From Jennychen's letter—just received by Laura—I see that 
Longuet has gone to Aubin with Wolf g and Harry. Unfortunately Jen­
nychen's health gives cause for concern, as I had already been told by 
the doctors (Feugier and Dourlen) in Paris. Jennychen anxiously

My dear Laura, 
I hope Mohr got my short note of the 18th.a Today, though under 
difficulties, I must fulfil my word to you. Have worked all day till six, 
then dined, now it's just nine, and so I am still a little under the influ­
ence of digestion, and besides Percyb is sitting in the room but for­
tunately has got hold of Joseph Andrews.c 
Do I know Vevey? Why I was quartered there in September 
1849 373  for about a fortnight and know all the Swiss shore of the lake 
from Villeneuve to Geneva, the Dent du Midi and the Mont Blanc 
and all the rest. If I am not much mistaken we officers were quartered 
in your Hotel on the Quay. On the square under the trees, facing the 
lake,  Willich used to exercise his two horses. 
I am only sorry you cannot even partially follow the route I made

out for you,a  the Bernese Oberland in many respects beats the lake of 
Geneva hollow. But if Mohr is to try for a visit to England in Octo­
ber, it will soon be time for you to leave the Alps. I do hope there will 
be no risk to him in trying to come. Otherwise it would be folly. But 
let the doctors decide, as also about his winter-resort. Only if he is to 
come he ought not to drive it too late. We have had fine but rather 
cold weather, especially night and morning; yesterday rain all day, 
today dry but mostly dull. By the way, Mohr's statistics of the baro­
meter 11 tally exactly with our experiences at the time at Yarmouth, 
only that we had a very wet day with the highest barometer, Tussy 
praying all the time for the stupid thing to fall again! 
As to the star-foaming wine, that quality is the exclusive property 
of Cortaillod— the other Neuchâtel wines do not possess it as far as 
I know, nor are they so good. 
I wonder who got up that foolish story about Bebel.c The Co­
logne Gazetted up to Friday last week0  (date of the Paris papers that 
reported it) knows or at least tells nothing about it. The thing looks as 
if it was a canard concocted by Mehring and worked at Paris by 
Hirsch. I may be on the wrong scent, but I should not be at all as­
tonished if it was so. Who else should have so quickly put in the 
Bataille and in the Citoyen a necrology, in which (in the Bataille at 
least) an old speech of Bebel's was quoted that he was for lawful 
means exclusively? The fright we got was something awful. On Fri­
day night two members of the Working Men's Society Tottenham 
St. 297 came and asked me, was it true? That was the first I heard. 
Tussy had the Bataille with the article mentioned above same 
night; the silence of the Justice might be explained by Longuet's ab­
sence. Hunting up German papers in the cafés was useless; the nos 
that could contain anything would no longer lie on the tables on 
Saturday. At last, Tussy (not I) got her Sozialdemokrat on Saturday 
night, and that was not only silent, but stated that Bebel was fit to go 
out again. To lose Bebel would have been irreparable. Where to find 
such another head not only in Germany but anywhere else? Where 
such theoretical clearness, such practical tact, such quiet determina­
tion among the younger generation? Well, it's not true and the relief 
I felt when all doubt had disappeared, I cannot describe. 
I am also extremely glad that Jenny has got over her crisis and that

the result is the fulfilment of a wish long felt by many.365 I believe 
she had a very hard time of it. No doubt Dourlen has provided her 
with someone to look after her, the people at 41 Maitland Park"

might perhaps be a blessing. 
Little Pumpsiac has the chicken-pox and is very restless and takes

Lafargue was the editor of the French edition and Malon sent in 
a highly inadequate affair, Marx wrote this introduction 20 with 
Lafargue, which may have been suitable on that occasion. In a Ger­
man edition edited by  myself,  that sort of thing simply wouldn't 
do. However, once Marx is back here I might at some time write 
a little pamphlet for you on the theme of German socialism from 1840 
to '52.387  It's got to be done some day. But Marx has got more than 
half the material, and God knows where he's tucked it away. 
I would, of course, have to have both drafts of the Accident Insur­
ance Act, ditto all the new bills of a social nature submitted to the 
Reichstag in the autumn. 
The wholesale condemnation of indirect taxation had been mooted 
by us as far back as 1849 and  '50,388  and that's where Lassalle got it 
from. I have noted the other things you say about Lassalle. Certain 
points are open to objection, but that's neither here nor there. 
Lassalle as a.person  simply doesn't come into it, but I cannot do other­
wise than demolish the illusion that Lassalle was an original thinker 
in the economic (or indeed any other) field. a 
I am glad to hear that the articles were written by Vollmar383; it 
shows how much he has come on. I quite agree with what you say 
about the Anti-Socialist Law. '6  We shall benefit only if the law  is pure­
ment et simplement b abrogated. And that will happen only if new life 
can somehow be injected into the German political puppet-show, and 
if something should happen immediately conducive to a revolution, 
a new era, 277 Russian constitution or something of the sort. In which 
case there can be no doubt that we shall obtain majorities everywhere 
where there are now strong minorities and, besides Saxony, win over 
all the larger towns. 
As for the French, your plaint is the eternal one which everybody 
voices. They are governed by the moment, and by personalities. 
I don't read the  Citoyen  and do not get the Égalité at all regularly, nor 
do I know whether it still exists, so cannot have any real idea of what 
the chaps have been up to of  late.  But of one thing you may be sure — 
there can be no peace with Brousse. The latter is, and will remain, 
a consummate anarchist, his only concession being the admissibility 
of participating in elections; moreover  he and Malon, by throwing the 
others out of the Fédération du Centre, 265 have intensified the strug­
gle in the conduct of which Brousse is employing wholly Bakuninist

tactics — slander, lies and every imaginable dirty trick. The tactics 
the others employ may on occasion be silly and childish, may fail in 
their objective and make it impossible for us foreigners to intervene 
on their behalf (as, indeed, we have regularly refused to do), but the 
fact remains that it has become impossible, once and for all, to do 
anything whatever in concert with Brousse. He will not rest content 
until his clique, 'Alliance'-fashion, 67 has gained control of the entire 
movement. Come to that, the whole of the 'workers' party', both fac­
tions included, constitutes only a small and dwindling portion of the 
Parisian working-class masses. The latter still continue to follow men 
like Clemenceau, against whom Guesde has conducted his polemic in 
a way that is far too personal and also quite wrong in other respects. 
Besides, Clemenceau is perfectly capable of development and might, 
given the chance, go much further than at present, especially once he 
has realised that what is entailed is a  class  struggle;  true, he won't real­
ise this until he has to. Now, Guesde has got it firmly into his head 
that Gambetta's  république  athénienne*  is far less of a threat to socialists 
than Clemenceau's  république  Spartiate, b and hence wishes to prevent 
the latter, as though we or any party in the world could prevent 
a country from passing through its historically necessary stages of 
development; nor has he stopped to think that it would be difficult 
to attain socialism in the France of a republic à la Gambetta without 
having first passed through a republic à la Clemenceau. But in the 
absence of such an insight into the necessary historical context of 
things and hence into the probable course of their development, 
party politics cannot be pursued with success. However, I have 
thrown up the sponge and am leaving the chaps to their own devices. 
Nor will the Belgians get anywhere with their admonitions. 
John Stuart Mill's niece and adoptive daughter, who contributed 
to the election fund, is called Helen Taylor and is not therefore the 
same as Ellen M. Taylor. Although both these Christian names mean 
Helena, they are two quite distinct persons. 
I know absolutely nothing about Garcia.c From time to time some­
one from the club 8 comes to see me, and I shall ask about him when 
the occasion arises. 
Apropos. How did the rumour about Bebel's death get into the 
Citoyen and the Bataille? It came as a tremendous shock to us over 
a Athenian republic-b Spartan republic-0 See this volume, pp. 347-48.

Dear Bebel, 
We have had a fine old fright on your account. A week ago yester­
day, on Friday the 15 th  " inst., 2 people from the Society8  came to see 
me at 10 o'clock at night in order to ascertain the truth of the report, 
which had already appeared (with obituary) in 2 issues of the  Citoyen, 
that you were dead. I told them that it was highly unlikely but could

say nothing definite. As I had a boring visitor sitting with me, who 
wouldn't go although I had ceased to utter a word, it was not until af­
ter 11 that I was able to hurry round to Tussy Marx and found her 
still up. She had the Bataille, likewise with an obituary, but with no 
details as to the source of the news which was, however, considered to 
be beyond doubt. Hence general consternation. The greatest mis­
fortune that could befall the German party was at least a strong 
probability. That there should have been no mention of it in the 
English papers, exulting as they were over Egypt, 355 was only too 
understandable. Well, on Satu.day evening my Sozialdemokrat failed 
to arrive, which sometimes happens, but on Sunday morning I was 
lucky enough to discover that Tussy had got hers and, to judge by its 
contents, the news seemed highly improbable. To have consulted 
German newspapers in cafés would have been hopeless from the 
start, since they replace them each day. And so we remained in a 
state of the most excruciating uncertainty until finally, on Monday 
evening, the Justice arrived with an official denial. 
Marx had just the same experience. He was at Vevey on Lake 
Geneva3  7 4 and read the story in the reactionary Journal de Genève 
which naturally retailed it as being beyond doubt. He wrote to me 
the same day absolutely aghast. a His letter arrived that same Mon­
day evening and so I was able to co /ey to him by the early post the 
happy news that the whole thing was an invention.b 
No, old fellow, you won't be allowed to peg out on us at such a ten­
der age. You're 20 years younger than I am, we have many a jolly 
battle ahead of  us and, when we have fought them side by side, it will 
be your duty to stay in the firing line, even though I may have cut my 
last caoer. And, since people alleged to be dead are supposed to live 
longer, you, like Marx,389 have now doubtless been condemned to 
a good long life. 
But who in heaven's name brought this nonsense up —  is that liar 
Mehring at the back of it again390? 
Did you get my last letter — written some 2-3 months ago? 
The one in which I replied about the tamer elements in the 
party? c 
Meanwhile you will have seen that your wish that I should contrib­
ute openly to the Sozialdemokrat has been met on several occasions.

Dühring chapters which are to come out in German after the French 
edition 360 and which I have extensively revised and popularised. 
The rest is finished but I shall keep it here, provided it does not upset 
the printing arrangements, so that this, the most difficult section, can 
be thoroughly gone over again. An appendix will follow in the shape 
of a lengthy note on early German common ownership of land. When 
you go to quod I would advise you to procure from one library or 
another: 
G. L. v. Maurer, Einleitung in die  Geschichte  der Marken-, Hof-, Dorf 
und Städteverfassung  in Deutschland, 
also his Geschichte  der Markenverfassung in Deutschland. 
It is very necessary that someone in Germany should familiarise 
himself to some extent with the subject — a person capable of reading 
these things with an open mind and without ready-made 'cultivated' 
preconceptions. These are the chief works and a knowledge of 
them would mean that you would have extremely solid foundations 
to go on in any debate about landownership or agrarian ques­
tions. 
Judging by the few articles he has written in the Sozialdemokrat 
(on the possible repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law), 383 Vollmar would 
appear to have turned out very well. I should be glad if this also 
proved to be the case elsewhere; we could damned well do with some 
efficient chaps. 
Marx is slowly recovering from his three attacks of pleurisy. For his 
long-standing, highly troublesome, sleep-inhibiting bronchial cough 
he had recourse while in Argenteuil to the nearby sulphur springs at 
Enghien, but in view of the bad weather did not, out of consideration 
for his general condition, effect the complete recovery that would oth­
erwise have been virtually certain. After that he went to Vevey for 
three weeks with Madame Lafargue, intending to leave there the day 
before yesterday, first for Geneva, then Paris and then, given passable 
weather, to come over here for a few weeks in October. Under no cir­
cumstances ought he to spend the winter in London, but whether in 
the south of England or elsewhere is for the doctors to decide. How­
ever I can tell from his letters that there has been a steady improve­
ment, albeit hampered by the bad summer. 
Where exactly are you chaps at this moment? It seems as though 
you have all been turned by the 'Lesser' 198 into a lot of Flying 
Dutchmen, just as Marx has been by his illness.

DEAR FRED, 
A letter from Laura in which I had enclosed a note 284 was acci­
dentally left lying on the writing-desk at Laura's and so cannot be 
sent off before the post goes.393  But in order that no time may be lost, 
I would again ask you to send me some bank notes from London as 
soon as possible  {address  as before to Argenteuil), in case Dr Dourlen, 
as I hope, allows me TO  CROSS  THE CHANNEL. 
Today rain is pelting down from the so-called heavens, despite the 
fact that Alphand continues to fear a famine  d'eau.  * 
At the same time, drop me a couple of LINES  AS TO THE state of the 
weather in London.

Dear FRED, 
Just as I was on the point of leaving Argenteuil for here (i. e. la 
Gare"  St Lazare), to wait for Laura, dine with her in Paris and return 
with her to Argenteuil, I was caught by the  facteur- h with your let­
ter 284 and enclosure. Laura will be arriving in  ABOUT  A quarter of an 
hour, PROBABLY with your letter to her. 
Today I was examined by Dr Dourlen in Jennychen's PRESENCE. The 
r element muqueux' has  disappeared;  SOME  whistling remains but I am 
well on the way to ridding myself of this persistent catarrh, the char­
acter of which has already changed considerably. My GENERAL habitus d 
has, it appears, improved enormously in addition to which I have 
grown 'fatter'. 
Under no circumstances does he wish me to spend more than 
a fortnight —  3 weeks if the weather is really fine — in London. He is 
less afraid of moderate cold than of a moist atmosphere. Nor, under 
any circumstances, am I to travel via Calais by the special night 
train, but go to Calais by day and not leave there till the day after, by 
the morning STEAMER. 
For the rest, la campagne  de l'hiver, c as he called it, should start ear­
ly, in the Isle of Wight, Jersey, Morlaix (Brittany) or Pau. Otherwise 
he would sooner I didn't  stay anywhere  too far  south  except  I.K CASE oh WEED, 
which is also why he had considered Vevey a better place for me than 
Montreux which is warmer. He assumes that normal temperatures, 
etc., will not suddenly rebel again in consequence of my arrival. 
Finally, he will not give me definite 'permission' to leave for London 
until his mind has been set at rest by the meteorological bulletins 
for the next few days. (French doctors are strongly prejudiced against 
the London climate.) He is now certain the cure will be complete, 
provided no mistakes are made. Hence I shall not get away before 
Tuesday r at the earliest.

If the French government —  AS REPRESENTED  BY THE  SWINDLING  FINANCIER 
Duclerc — knew of my presence here (particularly in view of the ab­
sence of the Chamber), it might, even without Dr Dourlen's permis­
sion, send me packing, the 'Marxistes' and 'Anti-Marxistes' 
having, at their respective socialist congresses at Roanne and 
St-Etienne, 394 both done their damnedest to ruin my stay in France. 
Nevertheless, I regard it as some compensation that the selfsame 
Alliance gang—the Malons, Brousses, etc.— should have seen their 
hopes so sadly dashed in as  much  as (to use our Bruno's a favourite turn 
of speech) the 'unspoken' innuendo, 'Marx is a "German", alias 
"Prussian", hence French "Marxistes 1" too are traitors', could no 
longer cut any ice with anyone, nor yet dare make itself 'heard', even 
for a moment.  C'est  un progrès. b

and occasional showers of rain; not cold generally speaking and the 
old, familiar fog only in the mornings and evenings. 
Schorlemmer came up to London on Saturday,a just for a friendly 
reunion; he has got to return to Manchester this evening, since he has 
to 'perpetrate' a lecture there tomorrow. He sends you his kindest re­
gards. 
Engels is most annoyed at not having been sent the Egalité 
for many months past, nor is my copy of that paper now being des­
patched to London. How much is the subscription to the  Citoyen,  incl. 
postage to London? I forgot about it when I left Paris and shall send 
a MONEY  ORDER immediately on hearing from you. 
Yesterday we dined with Engels; Pumps was there too,  OF COURSE,

tion livelier than that of her  maman  — at all events. 
Yesterday evening Donkin came to see me, but won't be giving me 
a medical examination until later this week; he thought I was looking 
better. He considers the ISLE  OF Wight to be the best place for me to 
stay during the approaching  FOG  TIME  OF England. 
Johnny is cheerful and, on the whole, 'HAPPY', although it's touching 
how often he speaks of his maman d and Harry. Under Tussy's guid­
ance he has once again acquired the habit of washing himself from 
head to foot in 'cold water' every morning. His 'well-being' leaves 
nothing to be desired; going to bed regularly at an early hour 
(8 p. m.) also suits him. His learning has progressed as far as 'capital 
letters', likewise to deciphering the large Roman numerals on 
clocks. 
I am most anxious that you should send me news of Jenny's STATE,

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN ' ' 3 
IN ZURICH 
London, 20 October 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I have long been intending to write to you  i about French affairs, 
but have only just got round to it. Just as well, since it means that 
I can kill two birds with one stone. 
1. St-Etienne.— Despite the well-meant advice of the Belgians, the 
inevitable has happened; the incompatible elements have taken 
themselves  off. 394 And that is a good thing. In the beginning, when 
the parti  ouvrier*  was formed, it was necessary to admit all elements 
who accepted the programme; if they did so with mental reservations 
this would be bound to emerge later on. We over here have never 
been under any illusion about Malon and Brousse. Both were edu­
cated in the Bakuninist school of intrigue; Malon was actually one of 
those responsible for the foundation of Bakunin's secret 'Alliance' 67 
(one of the 17 founders). But enfin, b they had to be given a chance to 
show whether, along with Bakunin's theory, they had also sloughed 
off his practice. Developments have shown that, if they accepted the 
programme (and adulterated it, Malon having introduced sundry 
changes for the worse), it was with the mental reservation that they 
would subvert it. What was begun at Rheims 323 and Paris337 has 
been completed at St-Etienne. The programme's proletarian class 
a workers' party-b after all 

=====第370页=====
342 189. Engels to Bernstein. 20 October 1882 
character has been eliminated. The communist  considérants*  of 1880 68 
have now been replaced with the Rules of the International of 1866b 
which had to be couched in such elastic terms precisely because the 
French Proudhonists had lagged so far behind, yet could not be left 
out. The positive demands of the programme have been neutralised 
in that every locality may, whenever it wishes, formulate an indi­
vidual programme for each individual occasion. Not only is the so-
called party of St-Etienne not a workers' party — it isn't a party at all 
because it hasn't in fact got a programme: at most it is a Malon-
Brousse party. The worst these two can reproach the old programme 
with is that it repelled more people than it attracted. That has now 
been put right: neither Proudhonists nor Radicals396 can now have 
any grounds for remaining aloof and, if Malon and Co. were to have 
their way, the 'revolutionary pap' of which Vollmar complains397 
would be the official expression of the French proletariat. 
In all Latin countries (and elsewhere too, perhaps), the practice as 
regards congressional mandates has always been exceedingly lax. 
Many of these could not stand close scrutiny. So long as it wasn't 
taken too far, and so long as only matters of little consequence were 
involved, small harm was done. But the Bakuninists were the first to 
introduce this (initially in the Jura) as a regular thing, going in for 
expert mandate-rigging and attempting by this means to make their 
way to the top. Similarly now at St-Étienne. The preliminaries to the 
congress have been generally dominated by all the old Bakuninist 
tactics which stop at nothing —  lies,  slander, covert cliquism. That's 
the only thing Brousse is master of. These chaps forget that subter­
fuges and the like, which may succeed in the case of small sections and 
in a small territory such as the Jura, will necessarily bring about the 
downfall of those who try them on in the case of a genuine workers' 
party in a large country. The apparent victory scored at St-Etienne 
will not be a lasting one and Malon-Brousse will soon be done for 
once and for all. 
It would seem that any workers' party in a large country can de­
velop only through internal struggle, as indeed has been generally 
established in the dialectical laws of development. The German party 
has come to be what it is through the struggle between the Eisenach-
ers and Lassalleans,269 in which, after all, the actual scuffles played 
" preambles (see present edition, Vol. 24, p. 340) -b  Association  Internationale  des Tra­
vailleurs. Statuts et  règlements,  London, 1866.

a leading role. Unification only became possible when the gang of 
scoundrels deliberately cultivated as a tool by Lassalle had lost its effi-
cacity and even then we were in far too great a hurry to effect that 
unification. 381 In France, those people who have admittedly relin­
quished Bakuninist theory but continue to make use of Bakuninist 
weapons and at the same time seek to sacrifice the class character of 
the movement to their own particular ends, will likewise have to lose 
their efficacity before unification again becomes feasible. Such being 
the case, it would be sheer folly to advocate unification. Moral homi­
lies are of no avail against teething troubles which, circumstances 
being what they are today, are something that has got to be gone 
through. 
Come to that, the Roanne people stand in great need of constant 
and searching criticism. Revolutionary hot air and futile impetuosity 
are things they are all too often prepared to tolerate. 
2. Citoyen-Bataille. As long ago as last summer, at a time when 
things were going badly for the Bataille, when its funds had been 
frittered away on advertising, etc., the capitalists had pulled out and 
Lissagaray had broken with Malon-Brousse, Lissagaray proposed to 
Guesde that the two papers be amalgamated, that they should both 
be editors-in-chief and each have the right to sling out three of the 
other  paper's editors. Thus did Lissagaray think to rid himself of the 
hated Lafargue. This was unanimously rejected by the editors of the 
Citoyen. The Bataille continued to founder. Thereupon Lissagaray 
approached the proprietor (a Dutch FINANCIER") of the  Citoyen,  and ne­
gotiated the amalgamation  behind  its editors'  backs  in the hope that this 
coup de main would place them at his mercy. The reverse happened. 
The editors of the Citoyen continued to publish the paper without 
a day's interruption, and sued the proprietor for breach of contract. 
Lissagaray's coup was thereby foiled and he himself utterly put to 
shame, as he has himself admitted by having recourse to the extreme 
measure of challenging the ' lâche b Lafargue', as he describes him in 
the Bataille, to a duel which, it is to be hoped, the latter will not ac­
cept under any circumstances.— That Lissagaray has ruined himself 
for good and all by this Bonapartist coup can be pretty well assumed. 
To go and risk the very existence of a paper at a moment when it is 
more necessary than ever to the party in their struggle against the St-
Étienne faction and to do so in order to save one's own paper from 
a Blommestein -b cowardly

foundering, to change (had this coup succeeded) the character of 
that paper, no matter what the cost, and to change it, what's more, 
in alliance with the bourgeois proprietor and in the teeth of the 
editors, the representatives of the party,— that really is a bit too 
thick! 
Should the enclosed be unduly strong, you must tone it down.398 
What's the position as regards printing the pamphlet?378 Marx is 
here (but secretly!) and will, I hope, be able to spend the winter on 
the English coast.

vait parfaitment,a  and was reduced to unmask himself  as what he really 
is, a Cassagnacquian spadassin. 40° Of course Paul will not have been 
such a fool as to  donner  dans  ce panneau. b 
Now for two days there have not arrived either  Citoyen,  or Citoyen  et 
Bataille, and today even La Justice is not to hand. We are therefore 
quite at sea. Has the  Citoyen  been stopped for want of funds after two 
nos, or has it merely been owing to the  génie éminemment organisateur des 
français c that we have not received it? You know, in a crisis like this 
we ought to be regularly supplied with that information which 
we cannot obtain here. I have written a long letter to Bernstein 
yesterday d about both Malon-Brousse and this last affair; but every 
day something may happen in Paris about which it would be impor­
tant to communicate at once to Bernstein the correct version. How-
can I do so without materials? Is it really impossible for the Parisian 
friends to do those things which are the most important to their own 
interests? 
I heard from Mohr today that you have written to him and that 
Jenny is better. Mohr is very well on the whole, Donkin who exam­
ined him was almost surprised at the great improvement he found 
(barring the unavoidable remnants of the two later pleurisies); he 
thinks he can pass the winter on the English South Coast. He will 
have to go soon, we have a perfectly beastly wet day to-day — but 
warm — and when other people have fine weather we begin to have 
fogs. 
I wish you could first pop in some Sunday evening and see the 
change. Mohr of course cannot go out at nights, so there is nobody 
but the Pumpses and now and then Helen.c The 'crimm' has entirely 
disappeared. The other day the great Loria called again. That eve­
ning Jollymeier happened to be here, and as we were all a little bit 
on, poor Loria had to undergo some chaffing, he asked Helen had she 
also studied political  economy  and told us he had tasted Moselle wine 
in Berlin but it tasted like sugar and  water.  Well, you can imagine the 
explosions. I appreciate, the poor pedant has enough of our 'sarcastic' 
company. Imagine he would not believe that you and Tussy were sis­
ters and stared when he heard who your father was. 
Today Signor Alessandro Oldrini called at Mohr's while I was 
there, but with a consistency of which I was very glad, he was not 
a was perfectly informed-11 get into this trap-0 Frenchmen's exceptional gift for 
organising -d See previous letter.-' Demuth

received. If Mohr had seen him, God knows how many Zanardellis 
would have followed. 
The Pumpses are getting on very well, they have been a fortnight 
or so in their new house, but it is not yet quite furnished — for want of 
cash.  The babya has had an abscess on the chest but is getting better. 
Charleyb and Miss Bevan have been married three weeks, I have not 
yet seen them since the happy despatch. 
Now it is getting on fast for post-time and as I want you to have 
this letter tomorrow morning I must conclude. Kind regards to Paul 
and if you see them, Guesde and Mesa. 
Yours affectionately,

IN ZURICH 
London, 27 October 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
In great haste the finale of the Paris affair,0 for I can hardly suppose 
the Parisians send you these things — even we over here have to 
extract them from the chaps by force. 
Well, the  Citoyen  continued to appear under its old editors, while 
Lissagaray edited Le Citoyen et la Bataille with the aid of two anar­
chists,  Mais and Crié. On Friday evening Citoyen et Bataille made 
an attempt to have the Citoyen confiscated (by the police) on ac­
count of a Wanda Kryloff feuilleton, whereupon the proprietor of the 
old Citoyen, Blommestein, a Dutch financier and now Lissagaray's 
associé/ asserted his proprietorial rights. Having been warned in 
a Lilian Rosher-b Presumably Roesgen-c See this volume, pp. 343-44, 344-45.-

=====第375页=====
191. Engels to Bernstein. 27 October 1882 347 
good time, they removed the feuilleton, and the police inspector 
who came to confiscate it had to go away discomfited. On Sunday, 
the editors of the Citojen et Bataille declared that, should further 
attempts be made to confiscate the Citoyen, they would resign en 
masse (all 3 of them). That same evening, Sunday, the Citoyen des 
deux  mondes,  as it had been called on legal advice, was confiscated for 
bearing an unauthorised title, again at Blommestein's behest. On 
Monday, i. e. Tuesday morning, it reappeared as the  Citoyen  interna­
tional and called upon the editors of the Citoyen et Bataille to stand 
by their word and resign. Not them! Mais and Crié declared secretly 
that they at any rate would resign, but did not; Crié was arrested 
for alleged complicity at Montceau-les-Mines 402 and is now in 
quod. 
In the meantime, since the editors of the  Citoyen  would have gone in 
daily fear of its being confiscated unless they changed its name, the 
paper has, for the past 4 days, been calling itself L'Egalité, alongside 
which the weekly Egalité is to continue appearing. Where they are 
getting the money from I don't know; it's 3 weeks since we had any 
news of the chaps. Nor did we get an Egalité today. But since your 
Frenchman's génie  éminemment  organisateur*  manifests  itself,  especially 
in our friends' case, in organising the most tremendous disorder, one 
cannot draw any conclusions from that. 
The attempt to kill the Citoyen with the help of the judiciary and 
police has stripped Lissagaray of the last remnants of his disguise. He 
has combined stupidity and baseness in rare measure. 
Marx asks whether you could procure for him a copy of the Swiss 
Factory Act.403 We should be greatly obliged if you could let us 
know in which year the Factory Act now in force in Germany was 
passed and whether it is a separate Act or part of the Imperial Trade 
Regulations. We should then be able to get hold of it. Marx needs it 
for the 3rd edition of Volume Ib  and promises in return to send you 
something every now and again for the  Sozialdemokrat.  In a few days 
he will be leaving for the Isle of Wight where, provided nothing unto­
ward happens, he will spend the whole winter (5 or 6 hours' journey 
from here). 
Your MISTER Garcia is one of the many little democrats who scurry

Hyndman, a strongly democratic and ambitious man who unsuccess­
fully stood for parliament in the recent elections. All these little folk 
have no one behind them but each other. They split up into all man­
ner of  sects  and into a befuddled non-sectarian tail consisting of those 
who hail democracy in whatever guise. They are intent on impressing 
the world with their own importance. Hence the catalogues of un­
known celebrities in Garcia's articles. In most of them there are good 
intentions and to spare, but likewise the intention to cut a figure. 
Hence I would advise you to treat the chap's letters with  considerable 
reserve;  after all, his principal aim is to elevate to the position of an im­
portant party a small clique which has, for twenty years, remained 
one and the same nonentity, if under various names and in a variety 
of guises. But, or so it seems to me, the Sozialdemokrat is not there in 
order to create a continental reputation for these busy nobodies. 
Herewith the card of one of the little associations of which Garcia is 
secretary and to which he recently invited me to lecture; I, of course, 
refused. 
I anxiously await the material on Bismarck.a If Marx goes away 
now, I shall set to work in earnest and, should I become engrossed in 
a lengthier piece of workb  which ought to have been finished long 
ago, I shall not be able to extricate myself at all quickly, and I should 
warn you in advance that in that case you will have to wait. If I had 
got the stuff.here, I could start in on it straight away and polish off 
this business first of all. Bebel promised but didn't send anything 
and now is actually bound for prison where Liebknecht already  is, 405 
and there's absolutely no hope of getting anything from the others.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 7 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 28 October 1882 
Dear Bebel, 
I have at last got round to writing — Marx has been back here for 
about 3 weeks and leaves the day after tomorrow for the Isle of 
Wight, so I have had no respite in which to do anything. 
As regards Vollmar's articles,383 I was particularly taken with the 
first one on account of its rightful dismissal of the wails emitted by 
those 'right wing' gentlemen who are clamouring for the repeal of the 
Anti-Socialist Law, '6  even upon conditions that would be worse for 
the party than the Anti-Socialist Law  itself,  provided this would en­
able them to go back to founding newspapers à la Gerichts-Leitung  and 
hence to the old literary fleshpots of Egypt. 406 In my view it would 
be perfectly in order to point out to these people — and it was exclu­
sively against them that the article was levelled — that a voluntary 
repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law might very easily be accompanied 
by conditions that aggravated the position of the  party;  to emphasise 
that the last way we shall rid ourselves of the Anti-Socialist Law is by 
begging and cringing. 
Otherwise the question is an academic one so far as I am con­
cerned. I believe that the Law will receive its quietus from the events 
which will usher in the revolution and which cannot be long in 
coming. 
I read the second article pretty cursorily as there were 2 or 3 people 
with me who kept chatting all the time. Otherwise I should have 
detected, from the way he visualises revolution, the French influence 
and hence also, no doubt, my Vollmar. Your handling of this aspect 
has been absolutely right. 407 It is the longed-for, ultimate realisation 
of the phrase 'single reactionary mass'. 408 Here all the official parties 
combined in a lump, there we socialists in column; a great decisive 
battle, victory at one stroke all along the line. Things aren't that easy 
in reality. In reality, as you indeed point out, a revolution begins the 
other way round, in that the great majority of the people, as also of 
the official parties, band together against the government thus isolated 

=====第378页=====
350 192. Engels to Bebel. 28 October 1882 
and overthrow it and only after such of the official parties as still 
remain viable have reciprocally, collectively and successively brought 
about their own ruin, only then will Vollmar's great parting of 
the ways come about and with it our opportunity to rule. If, like 
Vollmar, we were to try and begin the revolution straight off with the 
last act, we should have a pretty rotten time of it. 
I paid little attention at the time to the final passage on the new 
tactics — there's certainly a great deal of indictable stuff there if 
looked at in conjunction with the Penal Code. However no great 
harm can be done if someone occasionally goes a bit too far in this 
direction; as it is, they err all too often in the other. So if I have made 
too light of this passage you, or so it seems to me, have taken it 
too seriously; you will have seen from Viereck's jubilations in the 
Süddeutsche  Post how the right wing is seeking to make capital out of 
your reply. 409 I don't believe our people in Germany would have 
accepted Vollmar's way of talking simply on the strength of his arti­
cles, though the proclamation he has called for, 'We are organising in 
secret', certainly deserves to be rejected. 
I am eagerly awaiting the material on Bismarck,a but as you're 
both in jug,405 no doubt I shall now have to wait some time. But if 
by then I have got my teeth into a different, longer work, which has 
also long been pending,b I shan't be able to break off, and Bismarck 
will have to wait. 
In France the long-expected split has occurred.394  The original as­
sociation of Guesde and Lafargue with Malon and Brousse was prob­
ably inevitable when the party was founded, but Marx and I were 
never under any illusion that it could last. The point at issue is purely 
one of principle: ought the struggle of the proletariat against the 
bourgeoisie to be waged as a  class  struggle,  or ought it to be conceded 
that, in good opportunist (or Possibilist, as the socialist translation 
has it) fashion, the programme and the movement's class character 
be dropped wherever this would enable more votes or more 'support­
ers' to be won? Malon and Brousse have come out in favour of the 
latter, thereby sacrificing the proletarian class character of the move­
ment and making a division inevitable. Well and good. The develop­
ment of the proletariat takes place everywhere to the accompaniment 
of internal struggles, and France, which is presently forming a work-

ers' party for the first time, is no exception. We in Germany have 
passed beyond the first phase of the internal struggle (with the 
Lassalleans) and others still lie ahead of  us. Unification is perfectly all 
right provided it works, but there are things which take precedence 
over unification. And when, like Marx and me, one has spent a life­
time fighting harder against the self-styled socialists than against 
anyone else (for we regarded the bourgeoisie simply as a class and 
hardly ever took issue with individual bourgeois), one cannot feel 
unduly perturbed just because the inevitable struggle has broken out. 
I hope this will reach you before you go to quod. Marx and Tussy 
send their love. Marx is recuperating in fine style and, if there's no 
recurrence of his pleurisy, he'll be stronger next autumn than he has 
been for years. When you see Liebknecht in the 'Käfigturm',* as they 
call it in Berne, give him regards from us all.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 19 
IN PARIS 
London, 30 October 1882 
My dear Lafargue, 
I should be glad if you would send the daily Egalité regularly 
to the 
Editors of the Sozialdemokrat 
Zurich, Switzerland. 
In return, they will send you the Sozialdemokrat. The exchange — a 
daily for a weekly paper — may not be fair, but all the same it is you 
a prison (literally: cage tower)

who will benefit. The idea is to keep the editors of the  Sozialdemokrat  in 
touch with what is going on in Paris and, as you yourself will realise, 
it is impossible for a + proletarian editorial board to subscribe to all 
the sheets that keep springing up and disappearing in Paris. 
Up till now, the  Sozialdemokrat'' % chief source of Parisian news has 
been Vollmar, a German Reichstag deputy and ex-officer who was 
paralysed as a result of a wound. He is a friend of Malon's, so you can 
imagine the extent to which the latter has turned him against your 
party. To that end he has not only made use of the many mistakes 
with which you have unfailingly supplied him (an example being 
Léon Picard's absurd article about the Germans in Paris last Sep­
tember 4 ' °) but, as is his wont, has also told him one lie after another. 
For all that, Vollmar is a good chap; in Germany he issued a pam­
phlet so impossibilist383 that he will no longer be able to remain 
a Possibilist in France. It would be worth finding an opportunity to 
talk to him and get him to see the other side of the coin. I haven't got 
his Paris address, but it shouldn't be difficult to find. 
In Zurich I am bringing out a German edition of Socialism: Utopian 
and Scientific with a great many addenda. 378 I shall send you some 
copies as soon as they arrive. The thing will be about twice as long as 
your translation.20 Would there be any chance of publishing a new 
French edition based on this German one? 
Again I repeat that, for you, it is of the utmost importance to keep 
the Sozialdemokrat  informed; Bernstein could not be more willing, but 
from over here we cannot keep him in touch with things of which we 
ourselves are so often left in ignorance. You would do well to seek 
occasion to write to him, asking for information of some sort, etc. It is 
by such  innocent  means that Malon succeeds in ingratiating himself 
with others, means which you persist in ignoring. You should remem­
ber from time to time that Paris is no longer the capital of the world 
(which no longer has a capital) and less still the world  itself. 
Love to Laura. 
Yesterday Marx dined with me and in the evening we all had 
supper at his house, after which we sat together drinking rum until 
one o'clock, and today he has left for Ventnor. 
Yours ever,

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 413 
IN ZURICH 
London, 2-3 November 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Have still received no proofs378 (just arrived 3/11). On the other 
hand, have had from Bebel the Accident and Health Insurance Bill of 
1882,  but not the earlier one 144 which represents  genuine  Bismarckian 
socialism, unclouded by parliamentary divisions. This I would much 
like to have, along, perhaps, with other matter relating to the 
Accident Insurance Bank; without it I can do nothing.414 

=====第382页=====
354 195. Engels to Bernstein. 2-3 November 1882 
Many thanks for Marquis Posener.a I do not need all the details in 
respect of the remaining railways. The early or  mid-1879 prices  (before 
anything was known about nationalisation) would suffice. The differ­
ence between then and now would be proof enough of the way the 
state has bought up the bourgeoisie. 
In many respects Lassalle was a good jurist and, moreover, had 
studied his Roman law of inheritance sufficiently to impress jurists by 
the extent of his knowledge. (Impress was a favourite expression of 
his; while contemplating the Rosetta Stone 4 '5 in the British Mu­
seum, he said to Marx: 'Should I, do you think, set aside six months 
in order that I may impress the Egyptologists?') In Germany all one 
has to do is elaborate some point in accordance with a particular 
theory, and the jurists of today have forgotten that the theory elabo­
rated by Lassalle was lifted  word  for word  from Hegel's Philosophy of 
Law and History h and, moreover, does not hold water if applied to the 
Roman law of inheritance; this did not evolve out of what Hegel 
called 'the will'; rather, it evolved out of the history of the Roman 
gens, the tribal kinship group about which, indeed, few jurists know 
very much. I only said, by the way, that I should be obliged to 
demolish the legend of Lassalle as an original thinker, c and that is 
absolutely essential. 
I had not seen Lafargue's letter in the Prolétaire d and shall 
certainly ask for it to be sent me from Paris, though I am unlikely 
to get it. If you still have it, I should be glad if you could send it 
me; you shall have it back. Incidentally, Malon had better be on 
his guard; Lafargue has a whole pile of compromising letters from 
him. 
Picard's absurd article4  ' ° has certainly been disclaimed in the 
Citoyen, as Marx saw with his own eyes. Come to that, the man who 
sent it to you, marked in blue, does not know French; he has under­
lined as a chauvinistic remark of the Citoyen's a passage which Picard 
attributes to the exploiteurs bourgeois ... ligue des patriotes ... dont 
Gambetta est la tête'\ I have marked it in red. Picard enjoys pitting 
himself against Guesde and, by way of playing a nasty prank on the 
latter, smuggled the article into the paper; if a proper editorial

department were a possibility over there, this nonsense wouldn't 
have occurred. 
Now for the 'nothing short of creditable performance put up by the 
editors of the  Citoyen  in the affaire Godard'. 416 We happen to know 
all about this, Marx having often heard the tale when in Paris, both 
from those who had taken part and those who had had nothing what­
ever to do with it. Following an incident at a meeting Godard went to 
the editorial office of the  Citoyen  where he was accorded an amiable 
reception by Guesde who still has something of a soft spot — of  B. per­
sonal nature — for his erstwhile anarchist brothers. In the middle of 
a quiet conversation Godard, with no excuse whatsoever, suddenly 
dealt Guesde a violent blow in the face. The others sprang to their 
feet, whereupon Godard, like the cowardly anarchist he is, took 
refuge in a corner — surely they would not ill-treat him,  a.prisonnier*? 
And, instead of beating him into pulp, the childlike Citoyen chaps 
conferred together and decided qu'en effet il fallait le lâcher parce 
qu'il — était prisonnier b!! Godard left in a hurry, sad to say, unchas-
tised. But the following evening, when most of the editors were known 
to be absent, a dozen armed (with cudgels, etc.) anarchists forced 
their way into the office and, with threats, demanded satisfaction of 
some kind or other. Massard, however, stood firm, and they had to 
retire empty-handed. But now the fédération du centre 265 was informed; 
for several evenings they placed working men on guard, and  messieurs 
les anarchistes  did not return. 
But now I would ask you to give me some idea of the sort of thing 
the 'nothing short of creditable', etc., is supposed to have consisted in. 
The whole gist of your letter points to the conclusion that you are 
not getting the Citoyen regularly and hence, apart from the Egalité 
and the  Prolétaire,  have to depend on the accounts provided by com­
rades in Paris who, in turn, exclusively rely on the services of Malon 
and Co., in regard to whom their credulity would seem to have as­
sumed no mean proportions. In my view, however, the party organ 
ought in no circumstances to allow its judgment of a workers' move­
ment in a foreign country to be unduly influenced by comrades in 
that country's capital who are, after all, a shifting population. Ger­
man associations abroad are unquestionably the worst sources of in­
formation on the movement abroad; they seldom command a bird's 
eye view and generally have their own particular connections to the 
prisoner-b that in fact he ought to be let go because he — was a prisoner! 

=====第384页=====
356 195. Engels to Bernstein. 2-3 November 1882 
exclusion of any others, which means that they are unable to partici­
pate in the daily life and development of the movement around them; 
finally, they persist in the belief that, even today, they are still of more 
than passing significance to the masses actually inside Germany. 
What would have become of our freedom to form an opinion of the 
English movement or non-movement, had we paid the slightest heed 
to the changing majority in the London Society 8? And are not the 
German associations in New York equally uncritical in their attitude 
towards the American labour movement? Every association desires 
above all else to be thought important, and will therefore — in the 
absence of a very energetic and intelligent leadership — fall an easy 
prey to any foreigner who knows the ropes. 
Nor have you any other source, i. e. other than Malon at  second 
hand,  for your reiterated assertion that in France 'Marxism' suffers 
from a marked lack of esteem. Now what is known as 'Marxism' in 
France is, indeed, an altogether peculiar product — so much so that 
Marx once said to Lafargue: 'Ce qu'il y a de  certain  c'est que  moi,  je ne 
suis pas Marxiste.' a But if, last summer, the Citoyen was able to sell 
25,000 copies and attain a standing such that Lissagaray hazarded 
his reputation in order to gain control of it, b would not this seem some­
what incompatible with the lack of esteem you insist upon? Even 
more incompatible, however, is the fact that the said lack of esteem 
does not prevent these chaps from enjoying an esteem so great as to 
enable them, after being chucked out of the  Citoyen,  to start up an im­
portant new daily paper the selfsame day c and, supported almost ex­
clusively by workers and petty  bourgeois  {ouvriers et petits industriels A as 
Lafargue puts it), to keep it going for almost a fortnight despite ha­
rassment by the proprietor" of the old Citoyen, and find a capitalist 
with whom they will be negotiating the paper's 1 fate —  oui ou non s — 
tomorrow. The facts speak so clearly for themselves that Malon will 
doubtless have to swallow his 'lack of esteem'. However, so great is 
the 'esteem' in which Mr Malon himself is held that, upon his apply­
ing to Rochefort for an increase in the fee he is paid for his Intransi­
geant articles, he received the reply: Je vous paierai  plus si vous écri­
vez moins.' h One of these days Malon ought to have a go at found­
ing a daily paper in Paris without so much as a farthing in his 
a 'If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.' -h See this volume, 
pp. 343-44 and 346-47.-c  Ibid., pp. 344-45.- d workmen and small industrialists -
c Blommestein -r  L'Egalité (daily edition) - g yes or no -h 'I shall pay you more if you

pocket, and then he could show us just what the esteem he enjoys is 
capable of doing. 
But enough. I have asked Lafargue to send the Egalité to the 
Sozialdemokrat by way of exchange," and today he writes to say he 
will do so, in return for which kindly send the Sozialdemokrat to the 
Egalité. Should the Egalité not arrive regularly, you need only 
drop a line on a postcard to P. Lafargue, 66 boulevard de Port-
Royal, Paris. 
As regards Vollmar's articles,383 the first in particular, levelled as 
it was directly against those people who, cost what it  may,  are clamour­
ing for the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law,16 was very good and hit 
the nail on the head. The second I read rather cursorily before a jour­
ney, with 3 or 4 people chattering around me. Otherwise I would not 
have taken the lenient view I in fact did of the excessively fervent lan­
guage which, in conclusion, he advocates for use by the party. Bebel 
is right about this point407 which, however, I think he takes rather 
too seriously. The real weakness of the 2nd article (which I did note, 
but attached little importance to) lies in its childish idea of the com­
ing revolution which is to begin by the whole world splitting itself 
'A Guelph! A Waibling!',4 '7 into 2 armies — on one side ourselves, on 
the other the whole of the 'single reactionary mass'.408  I.e. the rev­
olution is to start with the fifth act, not with the first, in which the 
masses of the opposition parties stand shoulder to shoulder against 
the government and its blunders and thus win through, whereupon 
one after the other of the individual parties amongst the victors loses 
its efficacity and puts itself out of the running, until finally the 
mass of the people are thereby forced onto our side, at which juncture 
the decisive battle so much vaunted by Vollmar can take place. 
However, in this context the point was a subsidiary one; what mat­
tered was the demonstration that, if the gentlemen of the 'right 
wing' were to have their way, we should indeed be able to rid our­
selves of the Anti-Socialist Law on conditions which, while more 
detrimental to the party than the Anti-Socialist Law  itself,  would 
permit these gentlemen to publish sheets like the Hamburg  Gerichts-
Zeitung, etc., and pass them off as party organs. In this I agree 
entirely with Vollmar and have, indeed, written and told Bebel as 
much. b

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 
IN ZURICH 
London, 4 November 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
T beg to confirm mine of yesterday's date. I also have pleasure in 
acknowledging receipt of your favour of the 1st inst. and make haste 
to reply to same.' As you can see, the old counting-house style is not 
yet quite defunct.— In fact I am writing straight away in order to 
save you a great deal of unnecessary trouble. It is most kind of you to 
hunt out and send all those books for us but 'as of now we have no 
real use for them'. For in the 3rd editiona Marx merely intends to 
bring the state of factory legislation up to date by making emenda­
tions and additions; to that end he needs the text of  the original  Acts and 
nothing  more.  Secondary matters such as the protection of labour, lia­
bility, etc., are not of importance for this purpose. And I wrote and 
told you yesterday what I still need for Bismarck414: the early or 
mid-1879 stock market prices of the last 6 railways to be nationalised, 
and the first reading of Bismarck's Accident, etc., Insurance Bills. 
If I need the latest edition of Salingb due to come out in the meantime 
(it was kind of you to advise me of  this),  I can get hold of it within 4-5 
days. 
I was quite glad to have your information about Garcia; after all, 
one never knows when one may not run into the man. What he says 
about agitation on the part of certain  TRADES  UNION  chiefs in regard to 
the channel tunnel is quite true. They are the very ones who were al­
ways open to purchase by the radical bourgeois (under Morley) and 
on this occasion they have been joined by G. Shipton, the editor of 
The Labour Standard. There is absolutely no doubt that these people 
are in the pay of the Channel Company; they are not running up 
travelling expenses, etc., out of sheer enthusiasm. Admittedly it is 
a pretty innocuous business at present, but Shipton himself has now 
had a taste of bourgeois money, of course, and in view of his utter 
spinelessness and unbounded craving for popularity, this may lead to 
3rd German edition of Vol. I of  Capital  -b Sali.ig's  Börsen-Papiere 

=====第388页=====

something more. He has lost his virginity and the other 'REPRESENTA­
TIVE  WORKING  MEN',  those who have grown grey in the hurly-burly, will 
doubtless take him completely in tow before long. 
That you are being bombarded from Paris with pro-Malon anti-
Guesde letters I willingly believe. But after all, the correspondent you 
cite pronounces himself an incompetent judge in as much as he ad­
mits writing under the impression of the current anti-German cam­
paign and reproaches you for doing your duty as editor of the party 
organ, namely 'taking a bird's eye view', critical and all-embracing, 
of the affair and, unlike  himself,  refusing to be swayed by transitory 
and local events. And if, 2 months later, the man is still harping on 
this one unfortunate article4  ' ° and permits his view of a significant 
faction of the workers to be determined by this one incident alone, 
does that mean that the party organ ought to proceed in an equally 
blinkered fashion? If there exists in Paris a whole lot of non-socialist 
and semi-socialist workers who vent their chauvinism on the hated 
Germans, is the  Citoyen  at fault? Certainly no more at fault than the 
German socialists in Paris if, when things come to a head, a whole lot 
of non-socialist German workers in Paris, London, New York or any 
other big American city accept a lower wage, thereby depressing the 
wages of the natives (in America even those of the Irish!) and bring­
ing the German workers  en masse  into not altogether undeserved disre­
pute? And, finally, if he found the article so hard to stomach, why 
didn't he object? A disclaimer did appear and admittedly it made 
pretty light of the matter, but Marx tells me that, according to the ten­
ets of the Paris press, it was as adequate as any that is customarily is­
sued in respect of an editor who has blundered, always assuming that 
no pressure  has been brought to bear on the paper. But such pressure 
could have been brought to bear, and very simply at that. Had a let­
ter of protest been drawn up and delivered to the office either by 
a single individual or a deputation, the editors would have had to 
take the matter seriously. Had the editor in attendance (it might even 
have been Picard himself) made difficulties, all that would have been 
required was the threat, that, if the letter failed to appear in the Ci­
toyen  on the following day, it would be sent forthwith to the Sozialde­
mokrat,  in Zurich. If your correspondent did not know enough French, 
Vollmar was there; had the latter been absent, Hirsch a would have 
gladly taken the thing on. If the chaps had acted in this way they 
a Carl Hirsch

would have earned themselves respect, taught the  Citoyen  a useful les­
son and I should have been heartily glad. But to submit to it all like so 
many sheep and then give vent to cries of woe is typically German 
and has earned the Germans the contempt they deserve. If we had 
put up with that sort of thing from the French and English, if our 
people had behaved so spinelessly in Germany, where should we 
be today? Before the German socialists in Paris demand it is their 
view of the French movement that should prevail in the party 
organ, they must demonstrate, firstly, that they are at all capable 
of free and impartial criticism and, secondly, that they are able to 
stand their ground vis-à-vis the French. Neither of these things has 
happened. 
As to the undesirability of a daily paper in Paris, I am unable to 
share your view. In Paris the influence of a weekly is confined to small 
circles; if one wants to influence the masses one must have a daily. We 
too were opposed to a daily when there was no prospect of getting 
hold of one and the childish emigration to Lyons took place in con­
nection with the Emancipation.208  Things are different now. The 
Citoyen  and its editors have made a name for themselves in Paris, bour­
geois papers of all complexions have been compelled to engage in dis­
putations with it and been triumphantly dismasted and, were we 
now to lose the daily, it would be a signal defeat. The fact that it can­
not be an ideal, perfect paper, that a spuriously democratic system of 
editing by  comité  often ends up with there being no editing at all, as in 
the case of Picard's article, in no way alters the case. Not long ago, 
however, Lafargue sent me the issues, some 20 of them, dealing 
with the split, 394 and it seemed to me that the paper was by no 
means so bad — apart from those aspects we have long criticised and 
which would be no different in a weekly. But in the view of anyone 
familiar with conditions in the Paris press a paper appearing twice 
weekly would be impracticable from the start; it would come still­
born  into the world. Either a weekly or a daily. And with the latter the 
former editors of the Citoyen undoubtedly now have a very 
considerable chance of succeeding, as is evident from their rapid 
transition to the daily Egalité which is already selling more than 
5,000  copies in Paris. 
Now for the Clemenceau MEETING. To assess this, like other things in 
Paris,  by German standards, is quite impossible. When Gambetta 
was unable to make himself heard in his own constituency, 179 there 
were shouts of triumph from the entire radical and socialist press. The 

=====第390页=====
362 197. Engels to Bernstein. 4 November 1882 
same thing has now happened to Clemenceau. 421 Clemenceau is 
a cool, calculating man, quite prepared to go further, when he sees 
the need for it, and even become a communist, provided he can be 
convinced:  convainquez-moi  donc!" And the workers in his constituency 
are employing a highly effective means of persuasion by demonstrat­
ing to him that his seat is in danger. That may give a shove to his 
somewhat slothful study of socialism. 
But who were the people who did it? Guesde & Co. on their own 
perhaps? No, the chairman was in fact Joffrin, Malon's friend and 
Clemenceau's future rival candidate in Montmartre! So our people 
were decent enough, as always hitherto in the struggle against the 
bourgeoisie, to vote for Malon's chairman and side with Malon's 
people. If we are to censure the attitude of the workers, Malon's 
people are far more deserving of censure than Guesde's. 
The passage in the  Citoyen  simply says that these tactics should con­
tinue to be employed against Clemenceau; if they have been success­
ful once, why not again? It remains to be seen whether the  Prolétaire 
would be able to pay the Egalité in the same coin at meetings. Noth­
ing I have witnessed so far has given me cause to believe that this 
would be so. But even were it momentarily to be the case, it wouldn't 
matter, and would be unlikely to continue for long. 
And now a quick word or two before the post goes — otherwise this 
letter won't leave until Monday morning — on the campaign you 
have in mind with regard to the programme.422 I consider it most 
untimely. The programme is a bad one, but no one discusses it any 
more. An amended programme requires that it should not be open 
to dispute. So long as delegates are not elected in public, therefore, 
so long as every mandate can be disputed, it would be better not 
to interfere with the programme unless absolutely necessary. An 
amended programme would give the right wing an excuse to set 
themselves up as the true faithful who have complete confidence in 
the old well-tried programme, etc. So think twice about it before 
sowing these seeds of discord among a party that is bound hand 
and foot. 
The greatest danger to any political émigrés lies in the urge to be 
up and doing; something has really got to happen; something has 
really got to be done! And so things happen whose import one fails to 
appreciate and which, as one later realises  oneself,  had far better 
a Go on. Convince me!

IN VENTNOR 
London, 6 November 1882 
Dear Moor, 
Today I got a note from Laura in which she tells me that the fate of 
the Egalité will not be decided until tomorrow 423; prospects, how­
ever, are most favourable. 
Have you seen today's  Standard?  Telegram from Frankfurta to the 
effect that, since Ignatiev's arrival in Paris, there have been renewed 
attempts — initially, it would seem, of a fairly lukewarm kind — at 
a Russo-French compromise: if France were to do something more 
about the extradition of dynamiters,424 Russia for its part would 
vigorously back up France in Tunis, Egypt, etc. So that explains 
the police campaign in France! We shall see if anything of a relevant 
nature is submitted to the Chambers. 
Lafargue has sent me the Prolétaire containing the indictment of 
himself,  Guesde, etc., which was read out at St-Etienne. 425 A truly 
Bakuninist concoction, but otherwise weak: its strongest props are 
mutually contradictory letters, written on the spur of the moment by 
Lafargue to Malon, and calmly reproduced by the latter without, it 
would seem, any fear of the same being done to his letters by 
a 'Russia and France. Frankfort, Sunday Night', The  Standard,  No. 18191,6 November 
1882.

Lafargue. Nor is he wrong; these gentlemen have made opportune 
use of their material and were Lafargue then to come out with 
Malon's letters, it would be  moutarde après  diner.*  I shall send you the 
thing tomorrow. But you must let me have it back for the sake of 
Bernstein, against whom I may well make use of  it. In place of what 
I asked for, or along with it, the latter has proposed to send a small 
library of books  about  factory legislation, something which I can only 
hope I have nipped in the bud in good time b; I expect to get the Swiss 
Factory Act403 any day now and shall order for you the latest Ger­
man trade regulations which contain the provisions for factories. 
No other news here.

DEAR FRED, 
What do you think of Deprez' experiment at the Munich Electricity 
Exhibition?426  It was almost a year ago that Longuet promised to 
procure Deprez' works for me (notably his demonstration that elec­
tricity makes it possible to convey energy over considerable distances 
by means of a simple telegraph wire). 427 For a close friend of 
Deprez', Dr D'Arsonval, is a contributor to the Justice and has pub­
lished this and that about Deprez' investigations. Longuet, as is his 
wont, is always forgetting. 
I greatly enjoyed looking at the 'PAPER' you sent in which Sher-

brooke and Rivers Wilson parade as 'TRUSTEES  IN LONDON  FOR  THE  BOND­
HOLDERS'. 428 In yesterday's Standard, HOUSE  OF COMMONS  DEBATES,  Glad­
stone was severely rapped over the knuckles on account of the said 
TRUSTEES,* since the above-named Rivers Wilson also occupies a senior 
(i. e. well-paid) position in the English PUBLIC DEBTS administration. 
Gladstone, clearly much embarrassed, at first attempted  TO POOH-POOH 
[the matter] but, upon notice being given of a MOTION of censure over 
Rivers Wilson, Gladstone mendaciously denied all knowledge of the 
Galveston and Eagle etc. Railway Co. OUR SAINTLY  GRAND  OLD  MAN  b is 
playing a role no less glorious over the 'extradition' from Gibral­
tar.412 It was not for nothing, one recalls, that this same Gladstone, 
together with one Graham, etc., underwent his apprenticeship in the 
captious official oligarchy under Sir Robert Peel. 
No one could be better suited for the clumsy, lying, stupid equivo­
cation and lame excuses that characterise the Egyptian affair than Sir 
Charles Dilke.429 He has neither the pietistic casuistry of Gladstone, 
nor the quizzical levity of the quondam' Palmerston. Dilke is simply an 
ill-mannered parvenu who imagines himself great by reason of his 
boorishness. 
Since I take The Standard here, I too discovered therein the tele­
gram from Frankfurt to which you allude." 
Apropos. I should be glad if Bernstein could send me the Jahrbuch 
containing the article by Oldenburg (at least I think that's what the 
author is called) on my theory of value.' Although I don't actually 
need it, it would nevertheless be better if I had before my eyes what 
was argued at the time. When I wrote to the little Dutch parson r the 
whole thing was quite fresh in my mind. Since then there has been all 
the business of my illness and also the loss of my wife — a long period 
of intellectual twilight. 
A violent wind rages ceaselessly here, particularly of an evening 
and at night; first thing in the morning it's usually wet, or at any rate 
GLOOMY; during the day there are always fine intervals which have to 
be snatched; at the same time the weather is unsettled, capricious. 
Last Sunday,6 for instance, at 4 o'clock, I went up onto the Downs 
where I walked along the cart-track past Bonchurch, the topmost of

whose houses, ascending in terraces, are almost on a level with the 
track (the lowest are right down by the sea); the track goes meander­
ing on, sometimes up, sometimes down, between the hilly part of the 
Downs and where they dip down to the sea. (When I was here last 
time with Tussy 234  I didn't venture up as far as the track.) Here one 
can spend hours sauntering along, enjoying hill and sea air at one and 
the same time. It was as warm as summer; the sky pure blue, with 
only small, translucent white clouds; all at once a  cold  shower,  SKY  SUD­
DENLY OVERCAST. To this, no doubt, I owe the muscular rheumatism (af­
flicting the left side of my chest, close to the old  corpus  delicti") which 
on Monday night became so severe that on Tuesday, overcoming my 
reluctance, I sent for a doctor. In reply to my questions, my OLD  SPIN­
STER MacLean told me that there were 2 doctors who called at her 
house. *The greatest, the most fashionable man-was 'J. G. Sinclair 
Coghill, Physician to the Royal Hospital for Consumption'.* I asked 
* whether he be the old fogey whose coach I had had the displeasure 
of meeting almost daily before the door of her house. Indeed,* he was 
the man. For he comes to see a permanent lodger here, an *old lady 
'with whom nothing serious it was the matter', but 'she liked to see 
the doctor at least 3 times in the course of a week'.* This johnny I de­
clined. However, the 2nd doctor who was consulted by her other lodg­
ers was, she said, a young man called Dr James M. Williamson. It 
was him I called in;  * indeed he is a nice young fellow, nothing 
priestly about him.* In fact, he could prescribe nothing save a LINI­
MENT for me to rub in. (So long as this muscular rheumatism persists 
it will hamper me, inducing as it does a feeling of discomfort, espe­
cially when I cough.) For the rest, he is apologetic about the bad 
weather. As regards the cough which has, particularly of late and also 
while I was in London, assumed an increasingly irksome, spasmodic 
character, I am my own health officer and hope I shall soon rid my­
self of it without the aid of a DOCTOR of medicine. 
In order not to be too dependent on capricious variations in wind 
and temperature when loitering out of doors, I am again forced to 
carry a RESPIRATOR with me, in CASE  OF NEED. 
A great commotion has been caused here by a letter that appeared 
in The  Standard*  and the  Globe  TO THAT EFFECT that Ventnor is a CENTRAL

Dear Sorge, 
I have paid for The Labour Standard up till 3 December, 4/5d., and 
advised Shipton to send all future accounts to me.431 Should you 
wish to cancel the subscription, perhaps you would let me have 
prompt notification. 
Marx was here for 3 weeks, very much better; all he needs now is 
decent air and careful treatment. His minor ailments have been van­
quished to the extent that he will certainly be rid of them next sum­
mer. The main thing is to get him through the winter without a re­
currence of PLEURISY, and for that reason he has gone to Ventnor in the 
ISLE  OF Wight4 ' ' whence I have just received a line or two from him.a 
So far as circumstances permit, the 3rd editionb will now be taken vig­
orously in hand there and won't, I trust, occupy too much time. For 
the rest he was very cheerful and sprightly and, if all goes well until 
next autumn, he will be stronger than he has been for years. 
My thanks with regard to Lilienthal. I now know the man as well 
as if we had been at school together.

soon find a LINE that will give him the opportunity he wants of getting 
on quickly. His letters have arrived but, like many others, unfortu­
nately still remain unanswered. 
Hepner is a proper Schlemihl 432; moreover his campaigns, like the 
one he is waging against Schewitsch, are too much concerned with 
hair-splitting. Who, after all, is going to wax so enthusiastic about 
'German culture'! He really ought to familiarise himself with Ameri­
can culture first. But that is typically German. Here we have someone 
arriving from a small town in the depths of Germany who cannot 
wait to enlighten America. However America will BREAK him IN all 
right and, since he has talent, and at one time also possessed a great 
deal of gumption, he may yet prove very useful. 
16 November 
That shows you what things are like here. Having had to break off 
a week ago I have only today got round to continuing this and, 
I trust, finishing it off. 
Lafargue has been in Paris ever since the spring; his wifell followed 
later, during the summer; she spent a month with Marx in Vevey.374 
For Marx had first been in Algiers,278 then in Monte Carlo (Mona­
co) 31 ° and in both places had suffered a recurrence of  PLEURISY.  After 
that he stayed with the Longuets in Argenteuil 327 where he availed 
himself of the sulphur springs at nearby Enghien for his chronic bron­
chitis.  Then to Vevey and finally back here. 
You might like to know that Lafargue (with a great deal of assis­
tance from me, since he had absolutely no intention of learning Ger­
man from his wife) has published in French 3 chapters from my Anti-
Dilhring (introduction and the two first chapters of Part III 'Social­
ism') under the title Socialisme utopique et socialisme scientifique. 20 It 
made a tremendous impression in France. Most people are too lazy to 
read stout tomes such as Capital and hence a slim little pamphlet like 
this has a much more rapid effect. I shall now publish the thing in 
German — with insertions calculated to give it a strong popular ap­
peal; the ms. is already in Zurich and the first sheet has been print­
ed. 378 I shall send it to you as soon as it is ready. Meanwhile you 
have,  of course, in Dr Stiebeling a purveyor of popular knowledge to

America in  utraque  lingua.*  He is a well-meaning man but no theorist 
and accordingly he is somewhat muddle-headed. 
The Egalité is now appearing daily and weekly. Whether the daily 
edition (in place of the  Citoyen  which our people were chucked out of 
thanks to a financial coup b) can keep going depends upon negotiations 
with a man of means. The Sozialdemokrat is being much too weak-
kneed in regard to the split between our people and Malon, but the 
smooth, cunning, rascally Malon (one of the 17 founders ofBakunin's 
secret 'Alliance' 67) has so ingratiated himself with the Germans in 
Paris and our people have made a number of such colossal blunders 
that the Paris people are doing their utmost to bring pressure to bear 
on Zurich. What's more, Liebknecht also intrigued with Malon when 
passing through Paris on his way home from here. If, however, 
Lafargue and Guesde commit some altogether too extravagant follies, 
I shall talk the Sozialdemokrat round, never fear.

[Ventnor,] 10 Novembera 1882

* My dear Tussychen, 
On the whole, I cannot at all complain of Ventnor. The weather 
was unsettled, tempestuous, alternately rainy, dry, sunny, chilly, etc., 
but with all that very seldom foggy, a good deal of pure air and, 
except [for] a few days, generally always a few hours fit for longer 
promenades. Yesterday and today the air rather cold, but from 11 to 
2 o'clock on the sea shore (where children are playing, and reminding 
me of poor Harryb) and on our Undercliff walk,234 and up to the rail­
way station, and even to the down, no want of sunshine! * 
You should not forget, dear child, that I was by no means quite  ALL 
RIGHT when I arrived here. On the contrary: a spasmodic cough pretty 
well all the time, a great deal of sputum, increasingly unsatisfactory 
nights during the previous 2 weeks, no sense of well-being whatever. 
That couldn't change all in one day; rather a progressive change for 
the better. 
Au fond*  I was in fact glad to have had recourse to Dr Williamson 
for my muscular rheumatism before Donkin's PRESCRIPTION arrived 
from London (today). The rheumatism is really very close to the 
former seat of my ITERATED PLEURISY, but Dr Williamson was able to 
convince me by percussion and auscultation that  ALL  WAS  STILL  RIGHT — 
and had been since Donkin's last examination. The cough has abat­
ed, but when he called today (his second visit) Williamson persuad­
ed me to take yet another medicine; it would, he said, shorten the 
transitional period leading to the stage at which all I shall need to 
complete my recovery will be fresh air and plenty of outdoor exercise. 
Under the circumstances I have not yet got down to any real work, 
though I have been occupying myself with one thing and another by 
way of preparation.

If not, you may be able to borrow it from Furnivall for me, or alter­
natively, as it isn't dear, I could also buy it in the EARLY etc. series.433 
Also would you see if you could find among the (old-style) Egalités 
(I mean the old weekly Égalité) on the table by my bed an article, or 
rather a report, on the encomiums of official  economists  in Paris with 
regard to cheap Chinese labour in Europe? I don't know whether this 
same matter of the Chinese was discussed in the copy of Malon's 
former Revue 43* (the copy is behind the sofa on one of the shelves of 
my book-case). If so you might send it to me if you cannot lay your 
hands on the Egalité. 
How is my Johnny faring? Cough gone? My love to him and

Finally, I must write to poor Jennychen. It distresses me; I fear that 
this burden is more than she can bear. 365

good can it do if every trifle must first be referred back here? I trust 
the rheumatism and cough are now on the mend. 
Today I am sending you 2 Egalités and one weekly ditto. The 
manifesto of the (Lyons) Conseil national 4 3 5 will convince you that 
the Lyonnais are still the typical louts they have always been. No 
further news about the progress of the negotiations with the Parisian 
capitalist, 423 so nothing would appear to have been settled yet. 
The rudeness with which Dilke replies to awkward questions4  3 6 is 
indeed striking, but seems very much to the taste of the bunch of lib­
eral parvenus who sit behind him. Well, they'll feel the cloture"*37 
soon enough. The business in Gibraltar4 '2  stinks more every day; the 
extradition was ordered, not only by the police, but also by a mag­
istrate, i. e. a. judge, and the Governor reads about it in the paper and 
doesn't lift a finger! Meanwhile the Russians are encroaching more 
and more on Persia and Afghanistan and building roads to Meshed 
in Persia and from Samarkand via Bukhara to Balkh (the Bactria 
of the Ancients) in Afghanistan, while their intrigues in Turkey are 
such that not even Aleko Pasha, their protégé in East Rumelia, can 
swallow them. But neither big Gladstone nor little Dilke have any 
eyes for this. The Russians certainly have something in mind for next 
spring. But the kind of credit they enjoy will be evident to you from 
the announcement of the Poti-Baku Railway's Preference Loan. 
They have to use a company as a cloak and, moreover, on what 
terms! 
Vollmar has opened his pro-Malon campaign in the Sozialdemo­
krat— Malon's promptings being instantly recognisable in the sac­
charine tone of the apologia with which the article concludes. 438 
But what do you think of Wilhelm'sb  panegyric of Bennigsen in the 
Justice? It's really laid on a bit thick, even for the worthy Wilhelm. 
The Swiss Factory Act403 also goes off in today's parcel. I shall ask 
Bernstein for Oldenburg's articlec at the earliest opportunity. Bern­
stein will probably think twice before writing to me; I made such 
good use of his own arguments to refute his conclusions concerning 
the French business that he is unlikely to find very much more to say.d 
Now, with the closure of the debate, the House of Commons has 
sunk wholly to the level of a continental Chamber which, in view of 
its present composition, is the position best suited to it.

I am very curious to hear more about the experiment made by 
Deprez at Munich.426  However, I completely fail to understand 
how, in that case, laws for estimating resistance in wires hitherto 
regarded as valid and still applied in practice by engineers (in their 
calculations) can continue in force. Hitherto it has heen calculated 
that, given the same conductive material, resistance  increases  in pro­
portion as the diameter of the conducting wire  decreases.  I wish 
Longuet could be induced to cough up those things. For this means 
that the vast and hitherto untapped sources of hydraulic power have 
suddenly become exploitable. 
But now I must pack up the papers. All well here.

MARX TO ENGELS 166 
IN LONDON 
[Ventnor,] 11 November 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
I return the Prolétaire.' Difficult to say who is the greater — 
Lafargue, who pours out his oracular inspiration upon the bosoms of 
Malon and Brousse, or these two heroes, heavenly twins who not only 
tell deliberate lies, but deceive themselves into thinking that the out­
side world has nothing better to do than to 'intrigue' against them 
and, indeed, that everyone has the same cranial structure as the 
magnanimous twain. 
Lafargue has the blemish customarily found in the negro tribe —  no 
sense  of shame, by which I mean shame about making a fool of  oneself. 
But it is time, if the journalb is not to be wilfully ruined and if they

do not intend (which I can't believe) to let it go under as a result of 
proceedings taken by the government — it is time, I say, for Lafargue 
to put a stop to his childish bragging about the grisly deeds of  his rev­
olution of the future. But on this occasion he has been properly hoist 
with his own petard. Naturally alarmed because some denunciatory 
sheet or other, in defiance of police regulations, has reprinted hair-
raising anarchist excerpts from the suppressed Étendard, thus making 
the latter seem 'more progressive' than Paul Lafargue, the licensed 
oracle of  socialisme  scientifique —alarmed at such revolutionary com­
petition, Lafargue quotes himself (and he has, of late, acquired 
a pretty habit, not only of unloosing his oracles on the world, but of 
'perpetuating' them by self-quotation) as proof that the Etendard, i. e. 
that anarchism, has merely aped the wisdom of Lafargue and Co., 
though merely with the intention of realising it prematurely, before 
the time is ripe. That's what sometimes happens to oracles; what they 
believe to be their own inspiration is, on the contrary and more often 
than not, merely a recollection that has remained stuck in their 
minds. And what Lafargue has written and 'quoted' from himself is, 
in fact, no more than the recollection of a Bakunian precept. 
Lafargue is, indeed, the last remaining disciple of Bakunin seriously 
to believe in him. He should reread the pamphlet he and you wrote 
about the 'Alliance', a and then he would realise whence he has de­
rived this, his most recent ammunition. Indeed, much time has had to 
pass before he  HAD  UNDERSTOOD Bakunin  AND,  INTO  THE  BARGAIN,  HAS  MISUN­
DERSTOOD HIM.

etc., have invariably formed part of the brews I have previously had 
to swallow.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN VIENNA 
London, 15 November 1882 
Dear Mr Kautsky, 
I got your telegram at 3 p. m. today and at once replied by tele­
graph: 'Impossible'. Not having your home address to hand and nec­
essarily assuming from the 'Reply paid' that the office of origin 
would know  where  to send the reply, I addressed the telegram simply 
'Kautsky, Vienna'. Well, I have this moment, 9.30 p. m., received the 
enclosed slip. There is no possibility of tracing the letter with your 
home address, so all I can do is write to you at once in order not to 
miss the morning post. 
If I am not to dissipate every bit of my energy again, and I have 
been doing this for years, I shall have to draw a very strict line so far 
as my journalistic activity is concerned — confining myself to the 
Sozialdemokrat and even then writing only when practical need arises

or when, as in the recent case of Mehring's inanities,346  it has to be 
shown that there is no hostility between the Sozialdemokrat and us 
over here. As a result of Marx's absence and illness, party correspond­
ence with diverse countries has devolved exclusively upon  myself,  and 
that is a heavy enough burden anyway. So if I am to devote my ad­
vancing years to the completion of my more weighty works, 439 it will 
be utterly impossible for me to contribute to your periodical," though 
I wish it every success. 
The Darwin article in particular is an impossibility just now. 
I wrote to Bernstein saying he should have it as soon as I lit upon this 
subject in the course of my studies, and that might be months ahead; 
not that he is entirely blameless for he has encouraged me to work in 
a quite different field — one that I, too, consider to be more neces­
sary. b So until I have slogged my way through that, returned to 
natural science and then progressed to zoology, there can be no 
question of it. To dash off a few commonplaces on Darwin would 
serve neither you nor me. For the rest I must confine  myself,  in view 
of the late hour, to thanking you for the various interesting reports on 
the situation over there and in conclusion sending you my heartiest 
congratulations on your engagement.c 
Yours very sincerely,

Dear Moor, 
I was  on the  point of asking you how your reserves stood when your 
letter  * arrived today. Encl.  CHEQUE  for £30  which  you  will be able  to 
cash in the  usual way. That being so,  you  will get the  money  on Mon­
day, possibly even  on Saturday  or, if  you're prepared  to lay out 1/-
on a telegram,  as early  as Friday. 
Encl.  1. a  mathematical experiment  by Moore.441  His  conclusion, 
namely that  THE  ALGEBRAIC METHOD  IS ONLY  THE  DIFFERENTIAL METHOD DISGUIS­
ED, relates,  of course, solely  to his own  method  of geometrical con­
struction  and to  that extent  is fairly correct.  I have written  to tell 
a See  previous  letter.

him 284  that you attach no importance whatever to the way in which 
one symbolises things in a geometrical construction, the application 
of the curves to the equations being, after all, sufficient. What's more, 
I went on, the basic difference between your method and the old one 
consists in your transforming x into x', i. e., making it a true variable, 
whereas the others proceed from x + h which simply represents the 
sum of two quantities but never the variation of a quantity. Which is 
why your x, even though it has passed through x' and reverted to the 
first x, is nevertheless different from what it was before, whereas if one 
simply adds h to x and then subtracts it again, x remains constant 
throughout. But then any graphic depiction of variations must neces­
sarily be the depiction of  a. past process, of the result, i. e. of a quantity 
that has become constant; the line x, the portion added to that con­
stant, is depicted as x + h, two portions of one line. From this it 
clearly follows that a graphic depiction of how x becomes x' and then 
x again is impossible. 
Further, 2., a letter from Bernstein which has just arrived and 
which I should like to have back.442 
(I was interrupted by Pumps and the baby" so shall have to get 
a move on with this letter as I have persuaded myself that it must go 
off at  5.30.) 
I don't know whether I ought not to fire a broadside or two at 
Vollmar for his doctoring of history à la Malon. 438 His suppression 
of the Marseilles Congress443 is carrying the falsification of history 
a bit too far. If Bernstein fails to raise this in the notes on the final 
article, it will have to be put right. 
I shall send you the Egalité as soon as I have read it. As usual, 
a letter Lafargue promised to write has not yet arrived. His public re­
ply to the examining magistrate, in which he came the professor, was 
a childish affair. 444 These people are acting as though they were 
absolutely intent on being arrested. Fortunately the government is 
pretty rocky, so it's possible that they will still get away with it.

DEAR  FRED, 
CHEOJJE  most gratefully received. 
Sam,a as you, too, immediately saw, criticises the analytic method 
as applied by me 44 ' in as much as he quietly sets it aside and instead 
turns his attention to the geometrical application, about which I said 
nothing at all. 
I might similarly dismiss the development of the actual differential 
method as it is called — beginning with the mystical method of 
Newton and Leibniz, then going on to the rationalist method of 
d'Alembert and Euler and concluding with Lagrange's strictly al­
gebraic method (still, however, emanating from the selfsame original 
premisses of Newton and Leibniz) — I might dismiss the whole of 
this historical development of analysis by saying that, in practice, 
no essential change has been brought about in the geometrical ap­
plication of differential calculus, i. e. in geometrical symbolisation. 
Since the sun is just coming out and this, therefore, is the moment 
to go for a walk, I shall not, pro  nunc, h enlarge further on the subject of 
mathematics but shall, on some later occasion, return to a detailed 
discussion of the various methods. 
Bernstein's information about the 'nationalisation' of the railways 
in Prussia is interesting.442 
I do not share his views about the great size of Malon's and 
Brousse's organisation445 ; the analysis provided at the time by 
Guesde of the 'numerous' (!) delegation attending the congress of St-
Etienne has not been refuted, but this would be straining at gnats/ 
The first decision to organise a genuine workers' party in France 
dates back to the Marseilles Congress 443; at the time Malon was in 
Switzerland; Brousse  WAS NOWHERE,  and the Prolétaire — along with its 
trade unions — held  aloof.

Dear Moor, 
You will have received my letter of yesterday's date, with CHEQUE 
for £30. 
Hartmanna  was here on Sunday evening in a state of intense inven­
tor's euphoria. His cell has been in action since Friday, operating 
a galvanometer with high resistance which at first registered more than 
50° and is now steady at 46°. It would, he said, continue to run smooth­
ly without further attention not just for three, but actually for six 
months or even a year. However, he had no intention of showing it to 
buyers because of as yet unpatented improvements. So my intervention 
was again required. I firmly refused and arranged for the matter — 
a perfectly simple one that presents no real difficulty— to be settled by 
Percy b (which it has), advising him [Hartmann] in future to supply his

English buyers with the article he had sold them and not something 
else, either better or worse. Whether it will do any good is another 
question. The chap's a fanatical worker; work and fanaticism are 
wearing him out; the only sleep he gets is between 3 and 5 in the morn­
ing, and he looks ghastly but is correspondingly well turned out and 
every time he comes here he is wearing a different suit. One of his new 
patent improvements is as follows: To protect the cell's caustic 
potash, KOH, against the carbonic acid in the air, and to prevent it 
turning into potassium carbonate, he poured oil onto the solution 
and, according to Percy, simply couldn't understand why this failed 
to do the trick, the combination of fat and alkali forming instead 
something that looked like soap and, indeed, was soap! 
I have recently obtained SECONDHAND what I have long been looking 
for — a complete bound edition of  Geschichtschreiber  der deutschen 
Vorzeit, and guess from the sale of whose library it had come? — 
Dr Strousberg's!  I found therein a passage in Plutarch's Marius which, 
seen in conjunction with Caesar and Tacitus," explains the entire 
agrarian structure. 
The Cimbri 'had migrated, but not, as it were, all at one go, or in a regular stream; 
rather, they had always pushed on, year after year, during the good season and in this 
way had, over a long period, fought and battled their way across the Continent'.b 
This passage, seen in conjunction with the Suebi's annual move to 
new lands, as described 70 years later by Caesar, reveals the manner 
in which the Germanic migrations took place. Where they spent the 
winter, there they would sow in the spring and, having reaped, would 
move on until winter brought them to a halt again. That they  regular­
ly tilled the land in summer (if they did not engage in rapine insteed) 
can be assumed with some certainty in the case of peoples who 
had brought agriculture with them from Asia. In the case of the Cim­
bri, the process of migration is still in evidence; in Caesar it comes to 
an end, the Rhine forming an impassable frontier. Together, these 
two manifestations explain why, in Caesar, 'privati ac  separati  agri  apud 
eos nihil estu': migration means that collective cultivation was only 
possible by kinship community, and to pace out individual fields

would have been absurd. In Tacitus, the step forward — or, perhaps, 
back—to individual cultivation within the framework of common 
ownership has been made. 
Tussy has sent me by hand various newspapers for onward 
transmission to you; with them, I enclose an Egalité. The Egalité's 
impertinence would really seem to have made an impression on the

Dear Moor, 
Encl. letter from Lafargue which you might let me have back as 
I only got it this morning. So he will doubtless have to wend his way 
to the  cachot h within the next few days. What incurable fools they are. 
If Guesde and Lafargue are locked up in Montluçon, the paper c will 
be pretty well done for. The government dare not bring them before 
a court in Paris, but may well take the liberty of quietly neutralising 
one after the other in the provinces. Until the paper had been firmly 
established, they ought not to have provided any pretexts for inter­
vention; instead of that we have these Bakuninist antics. 
I had asked Lafargue for information about the relative strength of 
the two parties and also about the Maret-Godard affair.416 You see

what he says. Obviously it was to please the  Chambres  Syndicales"  and 
none other than Malon & Co. sacrificed the programme and the move­
ment's entire past since the time of the Marseilles Congress. 448 His 
apparent strength is his real weakness. If you debase your programme 
to the level of the most ordinary  TRADES  UNIONS,  you will clearly have no 
difficulty in obtaining a 'large public'. 
Electricity has enabled me to score a minor triumph. You may per­
haps remember my discussing the Cartesian-Leibnizian point of dis­
pute in regard to mv and mv2 as measures of motion.449  What it boils 
down to is that mv is the measure of mechanical motion when trans­
mitted by mechanical motion as such, whereas is the meas­
ure of motion when it changes its form, i. e. the measure in conformity 
with which it turns into heat, electricity, etc. Now, so long as 
the chaps in the physical laboratories had the sole say in electrical 
matters, the measure of electromotive force, the force regarded as 
representative of electrical energy, was the volt (E), the product 
of the intensity of the current (ampère, C) and resistance (ohm, R). 
E = C x R. 
And that is correct so long as electrical energy does not change on 
transmission into another form of motion. Now, however, in his presi­
dential address at the last meeting of the British Association,372  we 
have Siemens proposing an additional unit, the watt (hereafter W) 
which is intended to express the true energy of an electric current 
(i.e. as distinct from other forms of motion,  vulgo  energy) and whose 
value is volt x ampère, W = E x C. 
ButW = ExC = CxRxC = C2R. 
Resistance in electricity represents the same as mass in mechanical 
motion. Hence it would appear that in electrical as in mechanical 
motion the quantitatively measurable manifestation of this motion — 
on the one hand velocity, on the other intensity of current — 
functions, in the case of simple transmission without change of form, 
as a simple factor of the first power, while in the case of transmission 
with change of form, as a factor  squared.  Thus what I have formulated 
for the first time is a universal natural law of motion. Now, 
however, I must really go ahead and finish my dialectics of 
nature.

DEAR FRED, 
Enclosed Lafargue's letter. In my note to youa  I had already given 
vent in advance to my vexation over Lafargue's and Guesde's foolish­
ness,  and thus discounted it. Inconceivable that anyone at the head of 
a movement could place everything at risk in so frivolous, to put it 
bluntly, in so inane a way— pour le roi  de Prusse h\ Lafargue's article on 
the spellbound Ministry of Finance was very well done. 450 
As regards the Paris 'syndicates', I know from impartial reports 
I received from Paris (while staying at Argenteuil4  5 ' ) that the said 
syndicates are a great deal worse, if such a thing be possible, than the 
London TRADES UNIONS. 
Your verification of the role of the  second  power when energy is 
transmitted with change of form is very pretty and I congratulate 
you on it.c

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 
IN ZURICH 
London, 28 November 1882 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
To begin with, my best thanks for the information about the nation­
alised railways. It is amply sufficient.452 I have received from Bebel 
the Accident and Health Insurance Bills of  1882,  but must, of course, 
also have those of 1881, the original wording 144 being precisely the 
one in which Bismarck's soul, filled with ardour for the poor, has am­
ple space to flap its wings; in the second wording, in which the said 
wings have already been substantially clipped as a result of bourgeois 
divisions, we no longer find Bismarck in his entirety. 
Marx used to get the  Arbeiterstimme,  but as he has probably failed to 
renew his subscription it no longer arrives. 
Aside from a few minor points, Vollmar's article4  3 8 is pure Malon 
at one remove. In it the history of the French workers' movement 
since 1871 is completely falsified, and that sort ofthing simply should 
not happen. For instance, in the 2nd article Guesde is blamed for not 
having joined up with the few small cliques (later the progenitors 
of the Prolétaire or, in other words, the out and out  coopérateurs 
against whom he was just then conducting a campaign)! As though 
the chaps who were subsequently to bring out the Prolétaire would 
have even considered admitting a 'non-worker'! But more falsified 
than anything else is what Deville has correctly depicted in the 
Egalité of 19 November {'Il y a  cinq  ans',*  history of the Egalité), name­
ly, the fight for the 'collectivist' programme 68 at the congresses 
and the victory of that  programme  in 1879 at the Marseilles  Congress.*  *3 
This is completely suppressed in Vollmar's article. I cannot assume 
that Vollmar deliberately perpetrated this falsification, but nor is it 
any easier to explain his ignorance of the subject and the fact that he 
appears to know nothing at all about the French workers' movement 
save what Malon thought fit to tell him. 
Hence, by omitting the Marseilles Congress, he suppresses the vital 
fact that the French workers' party had accepted the collectivist 
'Five Years Ago'. 

=====第415页=====
212. Engels to Bernstein. 28 November 1882 387 
programme 3 years ago, so that Malon's abandonment of it was a  def­
initely  retrograde  step. Since it is now essential that our people in Ger­
many should be told the story of the French movement, not as it 
ought to have happened to fit in with Malon's present requirements, 
but as it really did happen, this is something which must unquestion­
ably be put right. In my view, the simplest way of doing so would be 
to relate it to the above-mentioned article by Deville, precisely be­
cause this is so utterly unpolemical. Should you no longer have it, 
I can send it you forthwith on a postcard. 
Malon, by the way, had better watch out. Should we at any time 
wish to portray his faits et gestes 3 more accurately if as minutely as he 
got Vollmar to depict those of Guesde, he would have a rough time of 
it. We still have all the documents in which, on 18 March '71, he dis­
avowed the  rising, only to join it after the event, when things were doing 
better than he had expected. 
Now as regards the strength of the two factions, I have obtained 
a report on the subject from Lafargue.453  In Paris the Roanne people 
have 15 groups with whose help they have kept the Egalité going for 
a whole month now, which does at any rate say something for the 
quality of these chaps. In the provinces they are, so Lafargue says, 
very strong. The Fédération du Nord 454 is, in essence, on their side; 
they do not wish to prendre part aux querelles  des Parisiens h but they 
uphold the old collectivist programme which also features prominent­
ly in their  Forçat;  the Roanne people are holding their next congress 
at Roubaix, to which all the delegates of the North will be going, 
and are constantly in the closest touch with the Federation du Nord. 
The other provincial workers' paper, L'Exploité de Mantes, has simi­
larly printed the old programme together with the considérants' 455 in 
a prominent position. It reprints articles from the Égalité, and 
Deville is a contributor. This means that the only two workers' organs 
in the provinces are both on their side. 'En  province', d aside from the 
North, 'partout où il y a un  groupement  ouvrier,  à Reims, Epinay, Lyon, dans 
tout le bassin houillier de l'Allier, à Bordeaux, Angoulême, Rochefort, 
nous battons les Possibilistes qui n'ont  de force qu'en Bretagne at à Mar­
seille — et encore.'  ' 
a goings-on-b  take part in the squabbles of the Parisians-' preambles- d 'In the 
provinces' -e  'wherever there is a concentration of workers, at Rheims, Epinay, Lyons, 
throughout the Allier mining district, at Bordeaux, Angoulême, and Rochefort, we are 
vanquishing the Possibilists who are strong only in Brittany and in Marseilles — 
if strong is the right word.' 

=====第416页=====
388 212. Engels to Bernstein. 28 November 1882 
That Malon should obtain a wide hearing for the empty verbiage 
of his  considérants  without a programme is not surprising. But if one 
founds a party without a programme in which everyone can have 
a say, it cannot properly be called a party. The impotence of the old 
sectarians, for whom Malon and Vollmar show such tender regard, 
has been in evidence for years and it would be best to let them wither 
quietly away. As for the  Chambres Syndicales "  — well, if one is going to 
account a member of the workers' party every STRIKE association 
which, like the English  TRADES  UNIONS, fights solely for high wages and 
short working hours but doesn't otherwise give a damn for the move­
ment,— then the only party one will actually form is one for the pre­
servation of wage labour rather than its abolition. And, or so Marx 
tells me, b these Parisian  Chambres Syndicales  are for the most part even 
more colourless than the English TRADES UNIONS. TO abolish a party 
programme just to please these people is no way to spur them on. And 
has the like ever been seen before — a party without a programme, 
a party whose wishy-washy  considérants  (written wholly in the spirit of 
the communist Miquel, who likewise believed communism to be fea­
sible in 500 years' time 456) lead up to the conclusion that each group 
should concoct its own private programme? 
Well, now, what benefit does Malon derive from the Chambres 
Syndicales?  They pay no contributions, they send no delegates to the 
Federal Council, they were nominal members of the Union federa­
tive 265 before the split and have nominally remained  so — they are, 
as Lafargue puts it,  'complètement  platoniques' '. They are there for 
show. As for Malon's other groups, Lafargue writes: 
'Dans le XVII arrondissement nos  amis ont organisé,  après  le congrès,  un groupe  qui immédiate­
ment s'est  trouvé composé  de 29 membres.  Pour nous faire  pièce , les possibilistes  ont subdivisé 
leur groupe  qui, à ce que l'on me dit, ne se  composait  que d'une vingtaine de  membres,  en cinq 
sous-groupes  réunis  par un comité fédéral du  quartier.  Le tour est joli, mais ne  trompe  que les 
indifférents et ceux qui sont éloignés.'' 
That's just what the Bakuninists used to do. On the other hand, so 
Lafargue says, the Possibilists are really strong only in Montmartre, 
where they are also well-organised. 
" Syndicalist Chambers-b See this volume, p.  385.-c  'In the XVII arrondissement 
our friends organised, after the Congress, a group of which the immediate composition 
was 29 members. To play a trick on us the Possibilists  subdivided  their group, which by 
all accounts consisted of some twenty members only, into five  sub-groups  convened by 
a federal committee in the quarter. It's a pretty trick, but one that can deceive only 
those who are indifferent or far away.'

212. Engels to Bernstein. 28 November 1882 389 
To be momentarily in the minority —  quoad"  organisation — and 
have the right programme is at least better than having no pro­
gramme and a large, though almost entirely nominal and bogus, fol­
lowing. We have been in the minority all our lives and have thrived 
on it. And the comparative weakness (supposing it exists, which I am 
very much inclined to doubt — the Possibilists did not dare attend the 
Roanne people's  conférence  contradictoire^  on the two congresses 457), 
the comparative weakness where organisations in Paris are con­
cerned would be outweighed two or three times over by journalistic 
influence. 
So how your Paris correspondents are able to regard the St-Etienne 
folk as the 'genuine workers' party' is beyond me. In the first place 
they are not a party at all, let alone a workers' party, any more than 
are the workers over here. But they are in embryo what those over 
here have become in full maturity, namely the tail of the radical 
bourgeois  party. The only thing that keeps them together is bourgeois 
radicalism, for they have no labour programme. And as for those 
labour leaders who descend to manufacturing a docile labour vote for 
the radicals, they are, in my view, downright traitors. 
Your remarks also led me, just for fun, to ask about Godard. 416 
The said Godard, 'qui se dit  anarchiste comme  son maître Maret, écrit 
dans un journal opportuniste de Toulouse'.' To refuse 
a chap of this kind what is known as a rectification is quite in keeping 
with the customs of the Paris, as of any other, press. 
On the other hand our friends have again perpetrated a really co­
lossal bloomer in as much as they have, by their rrrevolutionary brag­
ging, exposed themselves to prosecution before the paperd  had found 
its feet. Guesde has been arrested, as you know, and Lafargue will 
probably soon follow in his wake. When both are in jug, the most ac­
tive—  not only writing, but fighting — men will have been got out of 
the way. Deville is lazy, Massard quite good for his post aï secrétaire de 
la rédaction,  ' but they are hardly the people to keep a paper going in 
difficult circumstances. I won't mention the other  3 — Brissac and 
Bouis, old Communards, are so much ballast, and Picard is a com­
mon-or-garden journalist. 
Whatever you do, by the way, don't allow anyone to persuade you 
that Guesde and Lafargue intended, 'by hook or by crook, to make 
a as to-b public debate-1 'who professes to be an anarchist like his master Maret, 
writes  for an opportunist  Toulouse  journal' -d  V Egalité -' secretary to the editors

all organisations subject to their own directives'. It is a constantly re­
curring catchword in Bakuninist tactics, and in other contexts in 
France it may always be resorted to in lieu of other arguments. 
Treatment of other countries in the Egalitê\ If only you knew what 
disorder reigns and what the standard of German is like in that office! 
Should Lafargue remain at large, you would do best always to ad­
dress yourself to him; he does at least forward the things. Otherwise 
I have no advice to offer. 
If you want to use the resume of the pamphlet,378 I am quite 
agreeable. The concluding note will follow shortly. The affaire 
Schmidt458 is very nice. Pollaky has been running a private detec­
tive's office in London for some time. In the directory, under the head­
ing INQUIRY OFFICER (of whom 18 are listed), there is an entry: 
'Pollaky, Ignatius Paul, 13 Paddington Green, W. (not at all far from 
where I live), Correspondent to the Foreign Police  Gazette." 
I trust my congratulations on your attaining your 7th thousand3 
will again prove outdated. I, for my part, am 62 years old today. 
Kindest regards. 
Yours,

he is unable to understand all of a sudden and which may release

idea that the impulse might come from that quarter. And it is not as 
though I haven't explained this to him more than once. I regard his 
hopes for a new major crisis as premature — there could be an interim 
crisis as in 1842, and Germany, the most backward country indus­
trially, which must content itself with the crumbs that fall to it from 
the demand of the world market, would certainly suffer worse than 
any other. 
Guesde was released in Montluçon immediately after the first hear­
ing, and neither Bazin nor Lafargue was arrested; on the contrary, 
Bazin published in the Egalité a letter to the chief of police of his ar­
rondissement,  objecting to the  mouchards*  that sniffed round his house 
and advising him of the times at which he could be arrested at 
home. b Those chaps have more luck than sense. I shan't be able to 
read the Egalité until after the 5.30 post has gone; so it will reach you 
tomorrow by the 2nd post (2 nos). 
I have obtained, second-hand, Vom Entstehen und Untergange der 
polnischen  Konstitution vom 3. Mai 1791, 1793, place of publication not 
given. This is the book you have mentioned so often 460 in which the 
infamies perpetrated upon Poland by Frederick William II are 
described at length. Cost one whole mark! 
Hartmann's battery for lighting 6 Swan incandescent lamps is ex­
pected to be ready tomorrow. If the thing proves a success, i. e. pro­
vides a steady light over an extended period, hence actual proof of the 
constant intensity of the current, it will at once.be  exhibited in public 
and a company 'founded' to exploit it. Hartmann will also be show­
ing sundry items at the Crystal Palace* 61 where a new electrical ex­
hibition is shortly to be held. He and his backer, whom Percyc found 
for him, are highly enthusiastic about the invention. 
All well here.

IN LONDON 
[Ventnor,] 4 December 1882 
DEAR FRED, 
Herewith Bebel's letter459 which I found most interesting. I do not 
believe an industrial crisis will supervene as soon as all that. 
The weather in November was good on the whole, though very 
changeable. The first days of December alternated between bitter 
cold and a nasty, damp mugginess. Today it is fine, but I am never­
theless condemned to remain in my room. In the last few days I have 
suffered from hoarseness (certainly not due to talking) and an un­
pleasant sensation in my gullet; I have also been coughing more and 
not sleeping very well, despite my long, regular and constant walks. 
Hence I have again called in the doctor.a These gentlemen cannot 
be shaken off  so easily! It is only a tracheal catarrh, but all the same 
he thought I ought to keep within doors until the inflammation 
has gone. Besides giving me some soothing medicine to take, he 
has ordered me to inhale vapour of benzoin (with something else 
added— seems to me something like chloroform). Today he again 
auscultated and percussed me — for the 3rd time since my arriv­
al—  and found that everything was otherwise in order. He will 
drop in again in a few days' time to see if I can be released from my 
confinement. 
What is remarkable about the stuff in the Plebe concerning 
my theory of value is the rubbish talked by all 3, Laveleye, Cafiero 
and Candelari,462  in mutual opposition l'un contre l'autre. b In the 
quotation concerning my aforementioned theory of value which 
Candelari adduced from Malon's Histoire  critique  de l'économie  politique, 
Malon's superficiality is such that it actually surpasses that of all 3 
smatterers.

Dear Moor, 
What happened about the  Prolétaire  was this: when I recently sent 
you a parcel oi Egalités and Kölnische  ^eitungs, I also meant to send you 
the TRADES UNION Prolétaire 463 and supposed I had included it. 
Somebody was in the room while I was packing up the parcel and 
I did this rather hurriedly. Finding next day that the TRADES UNION 
Prolétaire was still here, but not the other containing the Saint-
Etienne skulduggery, 425 I thought I must have sent it you twice 
over. Now, looking around by the light of day, I have found it — still 
in the original wrapper in which you returned it, this being undoubt­
edly the reason why I couldn't find the same. 
From your postcard to Tussy,284 I see that you are still confined to 
the house — which is all to the good considering the snow we're get­
ting and the wet slush on the ground; but no doubt we shall soon 
have better weather (not the very best, but better than at present). 
During your first winter in the north since your attack of pleurisy you 
will have to resign yourself to tracheal affections of a milder kind; 
only next summer's cure will be able to scotch those. 
In order to get the parallel between Tacitus' Germans" and the 
American Redskins sorted out at last, I have gently been making ex­
cerpts from the first volume of your Bancroft.1' The similarity is,

I must say, all the more surprising in that the modes of production 
are so utterly different — on the one hand fishermen and hunters and 
no stock-breeding or crop farming, on the other migratory stock-
breeding overlapping with crop farming. It just goes to show how, at 
this stage, the method of production is less crucial than is the degree 
to which old blood ties and the ancient mutual community of the 
sexes within the tribe are being dissolved. Otherwise the Tlingits in 
what was once Russian America could not be the exact counterpart 
of the Germans — probably even to a greater extent than your Iro­
quois. 464 Another puzzle which is solved here is how placing the 
main burden of work on women is perfectly compatible with great re­
spect for those women. In addition, I have found confirmation of my 
assumption that the jus primae noctis," originally found in Europe 
among the Celts and Slavs, is a survival of the ancient sexual commu­
nity: in two tribes, widely separated and not of the same race, it is still 
exercised by the shamans as representatives of the tribe. I have 
learned a great deal from the book — enough for the present as 
regards the Germans. I shall have to save up Mexico and Peru until 
later. For I have returned the Bancroft and, in exchange, taken the 
remaining things by Maurer, 465 all of which are therefore now at my 
house. I had to look through them because of my concluding note on 
the Mark, 378 which is growing rather long and is still not to my liking 
although I have rewritten it 2 or 3 times. But to sum up in 8 to 10 
pages what happened after rise, flowering and decline is no joke. 
If I have the time, I shall send it you so that you can give me your 
opinion. As for  myself,  I should be glad to be quit of the stuff and to 
have another go at the natural sciences.449 
It's odd, the way one can see how the concept of  holiness  arose 
among the so-called aboriginal peoples. What was holy, originally, is 
what we took over from the animal kingdom — the bestial; as com­
pared with that, 'human institutions' were as much of an abomina­
tion as they are in the gospels by comparison with divine law. 
Hartmann's installation of his battery for lighting 6 Swan lamps 
(incandescent bulbs à 6 candle-power) was supposed to have been 
ready yesterday, but I don't know whether it succeeded or 
not. b 
I shall draw Bernstein's attention to Saarbrücken, as I have al­
ready done before. But the Anti-Socialist Law ' 6 will make material 
a the right of the first night.-b See this volume, pp. 381-82, 391.

ter nine are not forwarded until next evening. 
I had scarcely any money in the house, and had given Percy3 
a cheque to cash for me today in town. But he will not be here before 
six at best, also too late to send you a banknote by 5.30 mail. How­
ever as soon as I get the money I shall forward one so as to help you 
over the first few days. No doubt Paulb  will fare as Guesde and Bazin 
did and be at liberty if not to-day, at least to-morrow, as soon as the 
comedy of an examination before the austere Piquand shall have 
been gone through. 440 I forwarded both Paul's and your letter to 
Mohr, and told Nimc about the affair this morning. 
More anon, when I shall be able to send substantial comfort.

Darling Cacadou, 
All your letters have arrived on time and yet, miserable sinner 
that I am, it is only now that I write to you, having learned from the 
General's letter2 just received that Paulb  has been arrested. The 
General enclosed Paul's letter and yours, so that I am au fait. No 
doubt Paul will be released within a few days. 
Why haven't I written before? Because I had nothing particularly 
cheerful to report, for you will anyhow have learned from your cor­
respondence with the General that I myself am not at all in bad 
shape and have only been confined to the house for the past fortnight 
because of a  TRACHEAL  CATARRH,  nor have I again succumbed either to 
pleurisy or to bronchitis. This, then, is most encouraging, CONSIDERING 
THAT MOST OF MY CONTEMPORARIES, I MEAN FELLOWS OF THE SAME  AGE,  JUST NOW KICK 
THE BUCKET  in gratifying numbers. There are too many young donkeys 
for the old ones to be kept alive. 
Paul has latterly been writing his best  stuff'  with humour, impu­
dence, and solidity combined with verve, whereas before that I had 
been troubled by certain ultra-revolutionary turns of phrase, having 
always regarded these as 'hot air' — a speciality our people would be 
well-advised to leave to the so-called anarchists who are, in fact, 
props of the existing order, not creators of disorder, and are, by their 
nature, poor, childish creatures —  ce n'est pas  leur  faute, le  chaos. 6 Just 
now they have, as 'péril social'/ come to the aid of the 'affaires vé­
reuses  cabinet'. 46'' The worst of it is that, even if there were in existence 
a purely impartial 'examining magistrate', he would be compelled 
publicly to pronounce them wholly and utterly 'innocuous'! One 
could forgive these anarchists anything if only they weren't too 'inno-

I consider that the view here put forward concerning rural condi­
tions in the Middle Ages and the  second  phase of serfdom from the 
middle of the 15th century onwards is, on the whole, incontrovertible. 
I have read all the passages in Maurer 4 6 5 that relate to this, finding 
therein almost all my propositions — and, what's more, substantiated; 
also,  precisely the opposite, but either unsubstantiated or drawn 
from a period which happens not to be the one under discussion. This 
applies in particular to  Fronhöfe,  Vol. 4, conclusion. These contradic­
tions are due in Maurer's case 1. to the habit of adducing, indiscrimi­
nately and side by side, documentary proof and examples from any 
and every period, 2. to a residue of legalistic prejudice which invari­
ably trips him up when it comes to understanding a  process  of develop­
ment, 3. to his gross underestimation of'force and the role it plays, 4. to 
the enlightened presupposition that, since the dark Middle Ages, 
things must have changed steadily for the better; this prevents him 
from perceiving, not only the antagonistic nature of true progress, but 
likewise individual setbacks. 
As you will see, the thing isn't all of one piece, but is a proper 
paste-and-scissors job. The first draft was all of one piece, but unfor­
tunately it was wrong. Only by slow degrees have I mastered the 
material, which is why there's so much patchwork. 
Incidentally, the general reintroduction of serfdom is  one of the rea­
sons why no kind of industry could develop in Germany in the 17th 
and 18th centuries. First, there was the division of labour in the 
guilds which was the reverse of that in manufacturing; instead of 
being divided within the workshop, labour is divided among the 
guilds. Here in England, there was migration to those parts of the 
country where there were no guilds. This was prevented in Germany 
by the transformation of country folk and the inhabitants of 
agricultural market towns into serfs. But it was also this which even­
tually proved the undoing of the guilds the moment they encountered 
competition from foreign manufactures. I shall not mention here the 
other reasons that contributed to the suppression of German manu­
factures. 
Today has again been all fog and gaslight. Hartmann's battery 
probably a FAILURE where lighting is concerned, being useful at most 
for telegraphy, etc." More about this as soon as anything definite has 
been established.

London, 15 December 1882 
My dear Laura, 
Only after 7 last night Percya came with the needful so there was 
nothing to be done before today, so now I enclose a five-pound Bank 
of England note the number of which I have kept here, and will run 
the risk to send it whole for once. 
No doubt you will by this time be quite assured about Paul'sb fate, 
at least for the present.440  I have no doubt he is free again now, if not 
already back in Paris. But I am afraid the Bonapartist and other con­
servative judges of Montluçon will give them c a couple of months 
each of retired life. The government evidently wishes to create a few 
precedents in the provinces before it dares to try repression in Paris. 
And thus the parquet6  at Montluçon engaged the business, which, 
once engaged, must be carried out by the judges to the desired end,

But very likely their time will come at a moment when they, Paul and 
Guesde, are both most wanted for the Egalité. And the paper had so 
much improved lately. Whether it is the cumulative effect of Parisian 
life and journalistic activity, Paul's articles lately have been very 
much better, since he dropped the dogmatism of the scientific oracle 
and took up the ligne  spirituelle.  ' That on the candidature [of] 
Bontoux was charming, 47 ' but I think I discover a little female hand 
in that here and there. So was that on the behexte ministerium 1'*50 
(I forgot the French title) which also pleased Mohr specially.c  Now if 
Paul and Guesde are locked up, the soul of the paper is gone. Deville 
is witty and amusing only at intervals, generally he is clear but dull 
and doctrinaire, Massard is the reverse of a good Christian, for that 
with him the flesh is willing but the spirit (esprit) is weak. And I must 
conclude, from what information I possess, that Paul and Guesde 
are also the two who will be most wanted in a financially critical 
moment. Thus it will be a great pity that just at this time dynamitic 
brag and competition with the rrrrevolutionarism of the anarchists 
should have brought them in this predicament. 
Anyhow I hope you look down upon these petites  misères  du haut de 
votre  troisième d with the same calmness as the  quarante  siècles c of Gen­
eral Bonaparte du kaut de leurs pyramides' on the French army and 
Bonaparte  himself.

ENGELS TO MARX 7 
IN VENTNOR 
London, 16 December 1882 
Dear Moor, 
Having been interrupted yesterday," I shall continue today. You 
will have noticed how hurriedly my letter was dashed  off—  I was be­
ing perpetually disturbed by Pumps and  BABY,  b first while revising the 
ms.,c  then while writing the letter. The point by which I set most 
store — because of the dissentient view you once expressed —  is the 
almost total recession — de jure or de facto — of serfdom in the 13th and 
14th centuries. So far as the country east of the Elbe is concerned, the 
freedom of  German  peasants is an established fact by reason of coloni­
sation; as regards Schleswig-Holstein, Maurer admits d that at the time 
(somewhat later, perhaps, than the 14th century) 'all' peasants had 
regained their freedom. Again, as regards the South of Germany, he 
admits that it was in this particular period that the bondsmen were 
treated best. The same thing applies to a greater or lesser extent in 
Lower Saxony (e. g. the new 'tenant farmers', virtually copyholders). 
He does not, however, share Kindlinger's viewc  that serfdom did not 
come into being until the 16th century. That it subsequently reap­
peared, however, in a 2nd refurbished edition, seems to me indubitable. 
Meitzen  ' specifies the years in which allusions to serfs first recur in 
East Prussia, Brandenburg and Silesia: mid-16th century, ditto Hans-
sen in respect of Schleswig-Holstein. s When Maurer calls this a miti­
gated  form of serfdom he is right, if one compares it with the period be­
tween the 9th and 11th centuries which, in fact, saw the continuation 
of ancient Germanic slavery; right, too, if one compares it with the 
legal rights still exercised, as the statute books of the 13th century

confirm, both then and later, by the lord over his serfs. But as com­
pared with the de facto position of the peasants in the 13th and 
14th — and in North Germany also the 15th— centuries, the new 
serfdom was ANYTHING BUT a mitigation. Let alone after the Thirty 
Years'  War 472! It is also significant that, whereas in the Middle 
Ages there were innumerable degrees of bondage and serfdom, so 
that the  Sachsenspiegel 41'1' gives up the attempt to 'make a tally', this 
becomes remarkably easy after the Thirty Years' War. Enfin, a I look 
forward to hearing your opinion. 
It was also Pumps' fault if, at the place where I mention Russian 
common ownership, I failed to paste on a note saying that this infor­
mation came from you. 
The enclosed is from old Becker474; luckily I was able to respond 
to his gentle nudging straight away and send him £5, as I had

day.

Hartmann's battery ': so long as he only plugged in the galvanome­
ter, in which the resistance is represented by a very long wire so that 
there is only a gradual consumption of electro-mechanical power, all 
went well. But as soon as he plugged in the lamp in which the resist­
ance is concentrated at one point, namely the thin, short, incandes­
cent wire, that was that; the hydrogen immediately polarised the 
silver electrode, and the weak current produced only a faint red glow 
in the wire. Now his head is again full of all manner of innovations, 
each of which proves that he is looking for the difficulty in the wrong 
place. But whether the gents who are advancing the money will agree 
to any further experiments is a moot point. 
Do you think you might be able to book a couple of beds down

would not be at all averse to nipping down for a day or two, if noth­

view of Schorlemmer's rheumatism, etc. However, if we knew that 
you could arrange for us to stay either with you or close by, and

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 
IN GENEVA 
London, 16 December 1882 
Dear Old Man, 
I have been waiting for some time for some money to come in so 
that I could send you another fiver. It eventually came in yesterday, 
followed that very evening by your postcard.a I therefore im­
mediately took out a money order for the said fiver = 126 frs, and 
hope the money will reach you without delay. 
I was very glad to hear that you have extricated yourself from the 
cantonal and communal mire; it's a sheer waste of time and produc­
tive of nothing but tittle-tattle and pointless vexation. Incidentally, 
that jackass Solari is still sending me 2 copies of the  Précurseur.  It must 
be a fine despatch department! 
Every year the anarchists commit suicide and every year rise anew 
from their ashes, and so it will go on until such time as anarchism is 
subjected to serious persecution. It is the only socialist sect that really 
can be destroyed by means of persecution. For its perpetual rebirth 
depends on a steady supply of would-be bigwigs who wish to play 
a role on the cheap. Anarchism is as if tailor-made for that. But run 
a risk? Not on your life! Hence the present harassment of anarchists in

France will damage that gang only if it isn't sheer make-believe or 
hanky-panky on the part of the police. But either way its victims will 
be those poor devils, the miners of Montceau.402 Incidentally, I have 
grown so used to the anarchist buffoons that it seems to me quite nat­
ural to have that clownish caricature tagging along like this beside 
the movement proper. They are dangerous only in such countries as 
Austria and Spain, and then only for the time being. Again the Jura, 
where watch-making is carried on in houses scattered all over the 
place, would seem a foreordained hotbed of this ballyhoo, and here 
your blows could prove quite beneficial. 
Marx has been given permission by the doctors to spend the winter 
on the south coast of England and has been in the Isle of Wight for 
6 weeks or so.4 ' ' Hitherto, all has been well as regards the two main 
counts: no sign of any recurrence of pleurisy or bronchitis. The rotten 
weather we have been having here (for a week the fog has scarcely lift­
ed at all) means that convalescents are inevitably subject to colds of 
all sorts and, for one in Marx's condition, these are lingering and 
troublesome. But if it remains at that, no matter. However, he might 
well be sent out to Switzerland again next summer, in which case you 
will certainly see one another. 
Madame Lafargue's address is 66 Boulevard de Port-Royal, Paris. 
Not long ago her husband was arrested, but has already been set free. 
The point at issue was certain speeches he had made in the provinces 
and, upon their being summoned by the examining magistrate of 
Montluçon, he and Guesde, instead of obeying, poured vile scorn 
upon him in the Egalité. Whereupon he naturally issued a warrant 
for their arrest but, although Lafargue went daily to the newspaper 
office and was at so little pains to conceal his whereabouts that he ac­
tually announced he was going to speak, and did speak, at meetings, 
it took the clever Parisian police three weeks to seek him out. Like 
Guesde before him, he was immediately released after the first 
hearing at Montluçon. They might still get a couple of months 
apiece. 44° 
As you know, the workers' party in France has split.394  Malon and 
Brousse can hardly wait for the day when they become deputies, 
which means that a herd of voters has to be quickly rounded up. In 
other words a party created without  a programme  (literally — for a long 
series of  'considérants* a is followed by the conclusion that every local-

ity must draw up its own programme), in which every Tom, Dick 
and Harry is welcome and, to carry this through, people are being 
admitted into the party before the congress who accept the old pro­
gramme with the reservation that, come the congress, they will 
subvert it. Guesde, Lafargue, etc., were outvoted and those who stood 
by the programme went to Roanne. Our people are no tacticians and 
have committed hopeless blunders, but nevertheless they will win 
through and the 'Possibilists' won't have it all their own way for long. 
Our chaps have a very considerable lever in the shape of the daily 
Egalité and, moreover, are all of them devoted to the  cause,  something 
which cannot be said of those intriguers, Malon and Brousse. 
Well, good-bye, old man, and keep your pecker up. You're unlikely 
to decline as fast as all that and, as you know, we're all heading the 
same way!

request that his annual subscription be renewed and 'the balance be 
used for party purposes'.

I have now sent it to Marx who has slogged away at the subject much 
more thoroughly and for much longer than I have475; I expect it 
back on Monday. 
Malon se moque de' Vollmar. Otherwise he would certainly have 
corrected the latter's howler to the effect that the 'Alliancists' at­
tacked by the Egalité were understood in the sense of the Bakuninist 
Alliance. 67 Far from it. The Possibilists were thus described because 
they are now wholly indistinguishable from the people in the Alliance 
socialiste 4 7 6 which was founded some 4 years ago by Jourde, the ex-
Communard for finance, with the help of past and present Proudhon-
ists (e.g. Longuet) and which constitutes La Justice's socialist re­
serve. You must certainly have seen this Alliance mentioned in con­
nection with elections; it put up candidates for the recent general 
election to the Chamber and obtained nearly as many votes — in 
some  arrondissements  at any rate — as the Parti ouvrier. b If Vollmar 
knew nothing of this, despite his year and a half in Paris, it was 
because Malon deliberately kept it from him like much else. 
That's what happens when you give a gang your uncritical sup­
port. 
I have to chuckle when Vollmar praises Malon as the party disci­
plinarian and accuses the others of a breach of discipline.438 
Who,  I ask, is guilty of indiscipline — he who carries the old flag 
high or he who recruits people with the express aim of deserting the 
colours and exchanging the old flag for a new one? Where, I ask, 
would Malon have got his majority at St-Etienne from394 if he 
hadn't first recruited people whose intention from the start, and 
this was precisely why they had been recruited, was to subvert the old 
programme? 
That was a choice row between Malon and his Clovis Hugues over 
Louis Blanc. And they call themselves a party! 
You will have seen that the Fédération du Nord 454 has declared 
outright for Roanne. 
Some of Lafargue's articles in the more recent issues of the Egalité 
have been truly delightful, e.g. on Bontoux's candidature. 471

tions.

ENGELS TO MARX 7 
IN VENTNOR 
London, 19 December 1882 
Dear Moor, 
Your letter arrived at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon and this morn­
ing I got back the ms.a Your opinion is most flattering though it is one 
I cannot share, at any rate so far as form is concerned. As it was fine 
and warm at midday you will doubtless be released at last for an hour 
or two from your confinement indoors. Here, though, the fog has 
grown worse again since 1 o'clock and at times it is like night. 
This is how I see the Podolinski business.477  His real discovery is 
that human labour is capable of retaining solar energy on the earth's 
surface and harnessing it for a longer period than would otherwise 
have been the case. All the economic conclusions he draws from this 
are wrong. I have not got the thing to hand but read it in Italian not 
long ago in the Plebe. The point in question, namely how the 
amount of energy contained in a specific amount of foodstuffs can, 
through labour, yield a greater amount of energy than  itself,  I resolve 
as follows: Let us assume that the amount of food a person needs each 
day represents an amount of energy expressed as 10,000 cal (units of 
heat).  These 10,000 cal will, ad infinitum, = 10,000 cal and are known 
in practice to lose on conversion into other forms of energy as a result 
of friction, etc., a portion that cannot be put to use. Significantly so in 
the case of the human body. Hence the physical labour performed in 
economic labour can never = 10,000 cal; it is invariably less. 
But this is by no means to imply that physical labour is  economic  la­
bour. The economic labour performed by 10,000 cal in no way con­
sists in the  reproduction,  complete or partial, of these same 10,000 cal in 
any form whatever. On the contrary, they are for the most part lost in 
the increased heat given off by the body, etc., and such useful residue 
as remains lies in the fertilising property of excretions. The economic 
labour performed by an individual through the expenditure of these 
10,000 cal consists rather in the stabilisation over a longer or shorter 
" F. Engels, 'The Mark'. 

=====第439页=====
226. Engels to Marx. 19 December 1882 411 
period of the fresh cal he absorbs from the radiation of the sun, and 
this is the only connection the latter have, so far as labour is con­
cerned, with the first 10,000 cal. Now whether the fresh cal stabilised 
by the expenditure of 10,000 cal of daily nourishment amount to 
5,000, 10,000, 20,000 or a million is dependent solely upon the level 
of development of the means of production. 
To demonstrate this in the form of calculations is possible only in 
the case of the most primitive branches of production: hunting, fish­
ing, stock farming, agriculture. In hunting and fishing fresh solar 
energy is not even stabilised; rather, use is simply made of what has 
been stabilised already. At the same time it is clear that, assuming the 
individual concerned takes normal nourishment, the amount of pro­
tein and fat he obtains by hunting or fishing is independent of the 
amount of these substances he consumes. 
In stock farming energy is stabilised in as much as the vegetation, 
that would otherwise rapidly wither, die and decompose, is systemati­
cally converted into animal protein, fat, skin, bone, etc., hence 
stabilised over a longer period. Here calculations already become 
complicated. 
Even more so in agriculture where the energy value of auxiliary 
materials, fertilisers, etc., must also be taken into consideration. 
In industry all calculations come to a fujl stop; for the most part the 
labour added to a product simply does not permit of being expressed 
in terms of  cal. This might be done at a pinch in the case of a pound of 
yarn by laboriously reproducing its durability and tensile strength in 
yet another mechanical formula, but even then it would smack of 
quite useless pedantry and, in the case of a piece of grey cloth, let 
alone one that has been bleached, dyed or printed, would actually 
become absurd. The energy value conforming to the production costs 
of a hammer, a screw, a sewing needle, is an impossible quantity. 
To express economic conditions in terms of physical measures is, in 
my view, a sheer impossibility. 
What Podolinski has completely forgotten is that the working indi­
vidual is not only a stabiliser oi present but also, and to a far greater 
extent, a squanderer of past, solar heat. As to what we have done in 
the way of squandering our reserves of energy, our coal, ore, forests, 
etc., you are better informed than I am. From this point of view, 
hunting and fishing may also be seen not as stabilisers of fresh solar 
heat but as exhausters and even incipient squanderers of the solar 
energy that has accumulated from the past. 

=====第440页=====
412 227. Engels to Marx. 22 December 1882 
Further: Man, by his labour, does deliberately what plants do 
unconsciously. Plants — and there is nothing new in this of course — 
are the great absorbers and repositories of solar heat in modified 
form. Thus man, by his labour, in so far as it stabilises solar energy 
(which in industry and elsewhere is by no means always the case), 
succeeds in combining the natural functions of the energy-consuming 
animal with those of the energy-gathering plant. 
Podolinski went astray after his very valuable discovery, because 
he sought to find in the field of natural science fresh evidence of the 
rightness of socialism and hence has confused the physical with the 
economic.

Dear Moor, 
To come back to Podolinski again,b I stand corrected: storage of 
energy by means of labour takes place strictly speaking only in  arable

farming. In stock farming the energy stored in plants is, in gen­
eral, merely transferred to the animal, hence we can only speak of 
storage in so far as nutritive plants are put to use which would, in 
the absence of stock farming, go to waste. In all branches of industry, 
on the other hand, energy is merely  expended.  The most one can say 
is that vegetable products such as wood, straw, flax, etc., and animal 
products in which plant energy is stored, are made available by 
processing, i. e. are  preserved  for a longer space of time than if they 
had been allowed to decay naturally. Hence the time-honoured eco­
nomic fact that all industrial producers are dependent for their sub­
sistence on the products of agriculture, stock farming, hunting and 
fishing can, if desired, also be translated into physical terms, though 
this is not particularly rewarding. 
Herewith letter from Laura478; Jenny's case would not, in fact, 
appear to be too bad, always providing she obtains proper and regu­
lar treatment — this being necessary not because of any immediate 
danger, but because of the extremely unpleasant consequences that 
might result from neglect. 
Hartmann has thrown up the sponge here and tomorrow is cross­
ing the ocean again. It's just as well. His contracts over here have 
involved him in such a mass of legal obligations (some of them unful­
filled) that he himself no longer knows where he stands. I shall tell 
you all about it when I see you and am glad he is going away. It has 
now transpired that, all the while he was touching me for loans, he 
was pocketing anything from five to six pounds a week. 
You are right when you say that Bernstein doesn't always allow 
himself adequate time for reflection. But he's not alone in that. Take 
a look at Lafargue's recent discoveries in 'Prêtres et  commerçants' 
(Egalité, 20 December) and, ibid., Deville's latest reconstruction a 
of Weitlingianism 4  7 9—by no means an improvement. 
I am glad that 'we concur', as they say in business, on the subject of 
serfdom.b Certainly, serfdom and bondage are not a form peculiar to 
the Middle Ages and feudalism; we find them everywhere, or almost 
everywhere where conquerors have the land tilled for them by the 
original inhabitants — e. g. at a very early date in Thessaly. Indeed, 
this fact has clouded my view, like that of many others, of medieval 
servitude; we were all too eager to see it as being simply based upon 
a G. Deville, 'Le travail', L'Egalité, 4th series, Nos. 57 and 58, 19 and 20 December 
1882.- b See this volume, pp. 400, 403-04.

The crisis in America would seem to me, like the one over here and 
like the pressure on German industry that has not yet lifted every­
where, to be not a crisis proper, but the after-effect of overproduction 
dating back to the previous crisis. On the last occasion the crash in 
Germany came prematurely because of the milliard racket, whereas 
here and in America it came at the proper time, in 1877. But never, 
during a period of prosperity, had the productive forces been so ex­
panded as in the years between 1871 and 1877, hence, as in 1837-42, 
the chronic pressure herea and in Germany on the main branches of 
industry, especially cotton and iron; the markets are still not able to 
absorb all those products. Since American industry is, in the main, 
still working for the protected home market, a local interim crisis may 
very easily arise there, in consequence of the rapid increase in produc­
tion, but ultimately it will only serve to hasten the time when Amer­
ica becomes capable of exporting and of entering the world market 
as England's most dangerous competitor. Hence I do not believe — 
and Marx shares my viewb — that the real crisis will come very much 
before it is due. 
I would consider a European war to be a disaster; this time it 
would prove frightfully serious and inflame chauvinism everywhere 
for years to come, since all peoples would be fighting for their own 
existence. All the work done by the Russian revolutionaries, who are 
on the eve of victory, would be ruined and set at nought; our party in 
Germany, temporarily overwhelmed by the tide of chauvinism, 
would be dispersed, while exactly the same would happen in France. 
The only good thing that might come of it would be the setting-up of 
a Little Poland — which would also and automatically ensue from 
revolution; a Russian constitution resulting from a disastrous war 
would have an import, probably of a conservative nature, quite differ­
ent from one forcibly imposed by revolutionary means. Such a war 
would, I believe, retard the revolution by 10 years, at the end of 
which, however, the upheaval would doubtless be all the more dras­
tic. Incidentally, there has again been a prospect of war. Bismarck 
has been flaunting the Austrian alliance just as he did the South 
German alliances at the time of the Luxembourg affair in 1867.481 
Whether anything will come of this in the spring remains to be seen.

We found your reports on the state of German industry most inter­
esting, in particular the express confirmation that the cartel agree­
ment between the ironmasters had collapsed. It could not possibly 
last, least of all between German industrialists for whom the pettiest 
fraudulence is the very breath of life. 
We haven't as yet seen the things by Meyer482 and what you say is 
therefore news to us. That Marx would figure alongside his cardinals 
was only to be expected; Meyer always derived quite exceptional 
pleasure from proceeding direct from Cardinal Manning to Marx, 
nor did he ever fait to mention the fact. 
In his Sociale Briefe Rodbertus was hot on the scent of surplus 
value, but that was as close as he got. Otherwise it would have put 
paid to his thoughts and endeavours as to how best to help the 
debt-ridden country Junkers, something the good man surely could 
not have wished. But as you say, he is worth infinitely more than the 
majority of German vulgar economists, including the armchair social­
ists 82 who after all live solely off our leavings. 
The story of Carlchen's" wooing was also new to us. The wedding, 
or so I have been told by eye-witnesses, was a most mournful affair, so 
much so that someone who was present at the civil ceremony ex­
claimed: 'C'est  l'enterrement  de AP b 
Yesterday I sent off to Zurich the final ms. for the pamphlet, 
namely an appendix on the constitution of the Mark and a short 
history of the German peasantry generally.378  Since Maurer 465 
writes very badly and confuses many things, it is difficult to track 
down what you want at the first reading. As soon as I get the proofs 
I shall send you the thing, which contains, not simply abstracts from 
Maurer, but indirect criticism of him, as also much else that is new. 
These are the first-fruits of long years of study devoted to German 
history, and I am delighted at being able to present it first of all 
to the workers rather than to schoolmasters and other 'eddicated' 
gents. 
Now I must stop, for otherwise I shall not be able to register the let­
ter in time to catch the evening post. The Prussians would not as yet 
seem to have reached the stage of Stiebering 1 registered letters, all of 
which have so far arrived in proper condition. I have by long practice 
acquired a pretty shrewd eye for such things.

Dear Child, 
From Laura's letter (which Engels sent me for information today b) 
I see that Jennychen is again afflicted by that beastly inflamma­
tion. 478 Should it be neglected, I can only fear the worst. We must 
really consider (and you should talk this over with Lenchen before 
coming to join me here) whether we ought not to relieve Jennychen 
at any rate of Harry, even if it should necessitate his coming here. 
How can Jennychen find time for the treatment of her illness WITH ALL 
THESE  BABIES  TOGETHER? And again, how neglected (as regards health) 
our Johnny will be should one of the others not be displaced in his 
stead? 
Harry makes a difficult position doubly difficult for poor 
Jennychen.

sure).  Also Freeman's rotten little book (History of Europe), since it

MARX TO JAMES M. WILLIAMSON 
IN VENTNOR 4" 
Ventnor, 6 January 1883 
1 St Boniface Gardens 
Dear Dr Williamson, 
I return with best thanks the enclosed letter.483 
My intended promenade was yesterday stopped by the rain. When 
rising this morning about a quarter past 9 o'clock, I got suddenly into 
a spasmodic cough, gasping, wrestling as if it were with suffocation. 
Unfortunately, I had used up the morphia, nor had I any of the 'loz­
enges'  prescribed by you, but I took a table-spoon-(rather somewhat 
more)-ful of the tonic. What in point of fact surprised me was, that 
during the course of yesterday my cough was much less troublesome 
than it had been for the last weeks. Nor was my night specially dis­
turbed. Mere moral agencies, I suppose, do not touch the movements 
of the mucus. 
Yesterday afternoon I had received from Paris a letter with bad 
news as to the health of Madame Longuet, my oldest daughter. 
I knew of course that her illness was serious, but I was not prepared to 
hear that it passes now through a critical phasis. 
Yours very truly, 
Karl Marx

1 St Boniface Gardens 
Dear Tussychen, 
I received a short note on Saturday from Dr Williamson enclosing 
a letter to Williamson from Dr F. Bayshawe dated 4 January '83, 
5 Warrior Square, St Leonards on Sea, in which he says amongst 
other things: 
* 'We had a week of almost continuous rain or moist air, which gave place on the 
2nd to dry weather, of varying direction. Since that we have had sunshine each after­
noon, tho' not much of it. I will endeavour to send you some further statistics tomor­
row. I believe we may say generally that the climate of Hastings is dryer than much of 
the South Coast, tho' this may be at the expense of some warmth etc' * 
On Saturday (6 January) the weather here was fine round about 
midday; yesterday, too, it was dry, but colder; it is always sunniest on 
the esplanade. I went for a stroll yesterday and the day before, and 
today it promises to remain fine. It is generally coolish unless one is 
actually in the sun. At all events, a steady rise in temperature has now 
been predicted. 
There's always Hastings to move to if prospects here prove decep­
tive; besides which, there comes a moment when a change of place is 
of itself beneficial. This much at least we know — there is  SOME  SENSE 
in exchanging Ventnor for Hastings, but not for places on the South 
Coast that are closer to Ventnor and in which conditions are almost 
exactly the same as in the ISLE OF Wight. 
Every now and again I still have to tussle furiously with the accu­
mulation of  MUCUS;  after getting up on Saturday morning I EVEN had 
a spasmodic attack [of coughing] so that for several seconds I vainly 
struggled for breath. I believe it was due to nervous irritation — my 
anxiety over Jennychen! Upon that I need not enlarge. I would have 
hastened to Argenteuil at  once,  but for the possibility of saddling the 
child with the extra burden of a sick visitor! For no one can guarantee

ENGELS TO MARX 
IN VENTNOR 
London, 9 January 1883 
Dear Moor, 
In great haste I am sending you the following enclosures: 
1. Lafargue, 2. Bebel, 3. Hepner,484 of which I should like to have 
2. and 3. back. 
So at last there has been a report on Jenny's condition from which 
one can tell how matters really stand. In my opinion the case isn't as 
bad as it looks; the poor child has allowed herself to grow unduly 
weak as a result of over-exertion and her distaste for medical treat­
ment, but she will soon pick up again under Laura's management. 
I at once sent Laura -£ 15, the last five being intended to give Laura 
a somewhat freer hand when she visits Jenny and buys things for her. 
Until Jenny is able to run her house again, Johnny ought certainly 
to remain over here. 
Bebel's information on German industry is interesting, though it 
strikes me that one ought to take it cum grano salis.' What are ex­
panding are for the most part the luxury industries and possibly 
mechanical weaving—though in the latter case export opportunities 
are restricted by the tariffs on yarn. Since the annexation of Alsace

they have had more spindles than they need as also, since 1870, iron­
works, so how can big industry as such expand to any great extent? 
Moreover the fact that beet sugar has made such an impression on 
him suggests a narrow view. The circumstance that the state pays for 
the profits of the sugar-manufacturing Junkers has already been 
debated in the Landtag. 
Hepner. What do you make of the little Jew's proposal (obviously 
at the insistence of his  associé*  Jonas) to hold a pistol to our heads as 
regards a preface to the Manifesto? In my view, either one completely 
ignores insolent letters like these or at most refers him to the preface of 
the Leipzig edition b; if that isn't good enough for him he ought to 
leave the Manifesto unprinted. 
If you write to Sorge about Hartmann c (.supposing that you have 
not already done so) you might slip in a line or two about little 
Hepner. 
Time for the post— I had to go into town to see to the money and 
then get it off, have therefore been delayed.

DISPOSE  OF. I got your letter after I had sent off  mine,"  after my return 
from an excursion by the sea. I have had no further news from Paris. 
Today I was on the point of 'setting forth on foot' again — DESPITE 
THE NOISE  OF THE  WIND — when my doctor11  arrived; he told me I was to 
stay at home as it was very cold outdoors. He examined me again. All 
as before, in as much as the catarrh is  chronic  (hence, too, the persist­
ent hoarseness), though from a 'higher' viewpoint my condition has 
improved in as much as the critical spots have not been affected in 
any way. This semi-permanent cough would be tiresome enough, but 
with the daily vomissements c it becomes loathsome. This frequently 
makes work impossible, though the doctor believes — he still believes 
AND  THAT  is SOMETHING!  — he can rid me of this torment (with the help of 
a little remedy he has just prescribed). Qui vivra, verra. d 
Apropos. SOMEWHERE in my bedroom or my desk there must still be 
COPIES of my photograph from Algiers in a writing case or some LITTLE 
BOX or other. * If you could find them, you might send me two photo-
gramms. One of them I have promised to forward to Madame 
Williamson.*485 
Yesterday Mr Meissner sent me his account for 1881; it shows 
a very slight drop, so there is bound to be a corresponding increase for 
1882 as he also wrote saying that he is rapidly running out of copies 
of Capital.* 86 Naturally he is getting impatient about the revised 
sheets.c It is an unconscionable time since he heard from me on the 
subject. Now he will get some definite news. 
Cowen's SPEECH  quoad1 'EGYPT'  487 is on the same lines as Hyndman's 
political music of the future, English style. These groaning bourgeois 
(and even Cowen is a bourgeois in this respect), these poor British 
bourgeois, who groan as they assume more and more 'RESPONSABILITIES' S 
in the service of their historic mission, while vainly protesting against 
it — and can even Cowen himself help smirking over the entrancing 
little prospect of all those fortified offensive positions between the At­
lantic and the Indian Ocean and, INTO THE BARGAIN, an 'African-British 
Empire' from the Delta to the Cape? Very naice! In fact there could 
be no more blatant example of Christian hypocrisy than the 'con­
quest' of Egypt—conquest in the midst of  peace!  Even Cowen, and

this 'heroic exploit';  'THE DAZZLE OF OUR MILITARY PARADE'. POOR  Cowen! He 
is a typical British  'BOURGEOIS'  (on  this point);  he believes  he has  done 
a splendid 'deal',  and  very cheaply  at that;  he doesn't even  see  that 
the English  'OLD GRAND MAN'  a is simply  the  tool  of other, non-British

Dear  FRED, 
It was  very good  of you to  forward  me  Lafargue's letter  so 
promptly.484  It reassured  me  very much,  the  more  so since,  by the 
same post today,  I heard direct from Lafargue, according  to whom 
a turn  for the  better would seem  to be  assured.  I entirely share your 
view that Johnny ought under no circumstances  to leave just now. There 
can be no  question  of that until Jenny  has  completely recovered.  It 
would  be unpardonable  to add to the  difficulty  of the child's position. 
I shall write  to Longuet direct this very day.  I should  be glad  if you 
could drop Jennychen  a few  lines  to the  same effect. After all,  it's not 
as though Johnny  is going  to be  lost pour l'armée territoriale. c

It is curious how, nowadays, any sort of nervous excitement imme­
diately grips me by the throat, as red Wolff did his brother, the corn 
profiteer.488  Alias,* the initial shock of the bad news from Paris a few 
days ago induced a fit of spasmodic coughing during which I thought 
I was going to choke. Poor Jennychen must often have suffered from 
this highly DISTRESSING FEELING during the course of her asthma. 
As for 'little Hepner', I suggest we treat him in a 'businesslike' way, 
telling him that he is at liberty to reprint our preface to the Leipzig 
editionb and also pointing out that the Russians published a new 
translation last year.c If he doesn't consider it worth while to reprint 
the Manifesto without our writing  another special  preface,  he can take it or 
leave it, as he thinks fit in the circumstances. 'Holding a pistol to one's 
head' comes as second nature to 'our people' and, where little Hepner 
is concerned, it's something we have to accept as a matter of course. 
POOR Meissner has sent me a statement of accounts/or 1881, 486 say­
ing it had been a poor year; not that this really signifies for, by his 
own account, he was getting 'short' of copies in 1882; so the fewer he 
sold in 1881, the more he must have sold in 1882. My prolonged 
silence must have bamboozled him. At last Mahomet will be going 
to him, though not, alas, what he would greatly prefer—a bundle of 
revised sheets.d  Since my long — and only seldom interrupted — 
confinement to the house first began, but especially as a result of con­
stant nausea or, to use the more  aesthetic  South  German  expression à la 
Madame Karl Blind, née Cohen,' as a result of daily 'puking' (caused 
by my cough), I have up till now been scarcely capable of pressing on 
with the revision. But I believe that, given patience and rigorous  self-
discipline, I shall soon get back onto the rails again.

IN LONDON 
[Ventnor,] 10 January 1883 
Dear Child, 
The enclosed letter from Lafargue (be so kind as to send it back 
sometime) reassured me greatly on Jennychen's account, although 
Lafargue may have painted too rosy a picture out of consideration 
for me; but it does seem as though the immediate danger is over. 
Charming, the accounts of Wolf and Paa (who is now an IDOLATER 
OF Wolfs), etc. 
As things are at present (and Engels agrees with me over this) it 
would be a most unfavourable moment to send Johnny off to Argen-
teuil. He  cannot go  back until Jenny is again in a condition to look after 
her household. All one must concentrate on is the main issue, not less­
er considerations, and it was those that were very nearly the death of 
Jenny. What difference would a few months here or there make, quite 
apart from the fact that the poor boy would, from the start, be pre­
cipitated into chaos. 
I hope, Tussychen, that you will at once write to Jennychen telling 
her what I have said. I shall today drop Longuet a line on this sub­
ject, addressed to the Justice. 
You must let Johnnychen have news of his brothers and sister; you 
will,  OF COURSE, also give Lenchen the main gist of Lafargue's letter. 
Yesterday the weather was horrible; today, too, it looks damp and 
far from 'glorious'. But I shall, I think, [take] my 'CONSTITUTIONAL' to­
day [...]"

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN ' ' 3 
IN ZURICH 
London, 18 January 1883 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Days of festivity, followed by days of mourning,4  9 ° constant ob­
structions. At present I have scarcely a moment to call my own, as 
you will understand when I tell you that Marx is back here from 
Ventnor,4  ' ' confined to the house with bronchitis — so far, luckily, 
only a mild attack — and forbidden to talk much, while all the family 
business devolves on me. (But not a word of all this in the paper"; 
Marx would be furious if he were to see the worthy Viereck's indis­
creet and, what's more, not altogether veracious comments in today's 
Süddeutsche  Post.) 
Enfin, b I still have an hour or so to spare for you. As for Gumbel, 
returned herewith, he resembles Heine's Gumpelinoc in as much as 
he too is interested in stocks and shares. For that matter, he's an out­
standing example of the German socialist abroad, having obviously 
been in Paris. Because we have provided these chaps with a theory of 
which they are entirely innocent, seldom bothering, moreover, to ac­
quire a rudimentary — if indeed any — understanding of it, every 
provincial nincompoop among them considers himself superior to all 
other foreigners. Arriving from Heilbronn, or whatever the potty lit­
tle place may be called, in London or Paris, he is appalled when he 
finds that his particular brand of provincialism does not hold good 
there. Instead of broadening his horizons and learning something, he 
deliberately makes himself more blinkered than before, for this serves 
to render all the more glaring the contrast between himself and the 
bad, stupid foreigners —  i. e. his supposed superiority over them. Yet 
this is the kind of person who predominates in German associations 
abroad, and if you are now under pressure from them, just ask your­
self who it was, after the promulgation of the Anti-Socialist Law, '6 
that sought to give undeserved prominence to these associations by 
means of centralisation, etc. If you had known the chaps then as well

as you do now, you would have been unlikely to go to so much 
trouble. 
'The party with clean hands' — meaning what? The hands, per­
haps,  of Hasselmann or Fritzsche and of so many others, about whom 
everyone arriving here as an exile or something of the kind had a tale 
to tell? 
Gumpelino is at his best when he comes to his stocks and shares. 
When some such provincial champion of moral virtue tilts thus phari­
saically at practices, unpleasant enough in themselves, but from 
which the party none the less derives a real advantage that far out­
weighs any possible damage, there must be a catch somewhere. The 
workers do not have stocks and shares, nor do they give a damn for 
the financial page. Hence—the little bourgeois, who also wants to 
dabble in stocks and shares, proceeds to demand that his party paper 
carry a benevolent, honest, moral, financial page. In the first place, it 
is not the business of a socialist paper to indicate how best the workers 
can be exploited — income from stocks and shares is, however, also 
the product of unpaid labour. If, then, in the second place Gumpe­
lino nevertheless demands that the socialist press should do this, it 
says little for his socialism and even less for his flair as a business­
man. I, too, have stocks and shares, buying and selling from time 
to time. But I am not so simple as to look to the socialist press 
for advice on these operations. Anyone who does so will burn his 
fingers, and serve him right! Get yourself baptised, Abraham Gum­
pelino! 
We were delighted by the way Grillenberger and the Sozialdemo­
krat replied to Puttkamer's piece of hypocrisy. 491 That's the way to 
do it. Not to twist and turn beneath the opponent's blows, or whine 
and whimper and stammer out excuses about no harm's being meant, 
as is still done by so many. Hit back—that's what one should do — 
for every blow dealt by the enemy, pay him back two or three. These 
have always been our tactics and up till now we have, I believe, al­
ways pretty well got the better of our opponents. 'Moreover, the 
genius of our soldiers lies in attacking, as is perfectly right,' says old 
Fritz in his orders to his generals492  and that, indeed, is what our 
workers do in Germany. But when, in the debate on exceptional laws 
generally, — given that \_j 'sa abstract is right — Kayser, for instance, 
retracts whining that we are revolutionaries only in the Pickwick-
Louis Viereck (square in German = Viereck).

ian sense,3 what then? What he should have said was that neither 
the entire Reichstag nor the Federal Council would be sitting had it 
not been for a revolution; that old William, when he gobbled up three 
crowns and a free city,493 was likewise a revolutionary; that legiti­
macy  itself,  and the very foundations of the so-called constitution, 
are no more than the product of innumerable revolutions effected 
against the will of the people and directed against the people. Oh, 
this damned German slackness of thought and will, introduced at 
such pains into the party with the 'eddicated' men,— if only we 
could rid ourselves of it again! 
Time for the post. I shall reply as soon as possible to whatever 
points in your letter I may have overlooked. Thanks for the photo­

Dear Mr Bernstein, 
1. I trust you have received the final ms.  ( The Mark) which was 
sent off from here registered on 20 December. But the printing delays 
are now getting really too outrageous. If it goes on like this you had 
better reset the title and put 1884 on it. When, exactly, will there be 
another sheet?

2. I have received —  neither  the first Accident Bill, nor Bebel's 
speech on the subject. Meanwhile it has struck me that a specific 
attack on Bismarckian socialism has become outdated.a Viereck's little 
paperb has lost all inclination for it. Singer, who had been suffering 
badly from nationalisation mania on the last occasion but one, 
was,  on the last occasion, completely free of it and genuinely revo­
lutionary, 494  while as for those weaklings in the Reichstag, 
Bios,  Geiser & Co., their courage, if not their enthusiasm, would 
appear to have evaporated. So why crack a nut with a sledgeham­
mer? I think we should let Bismarckian socialism dig its own 
grave. After which all that remains is a criticism of the rotten Las-
sallean remnants. But if the pamphlet 378 is printed so slowly, this 
attack, too, may have ceased to be topical by the time the thing 
comes out. 
3. You are mistaken about Malon. The man is. not as stupid, or 
rather as naive, as he makes himself out to be.  C'est  un faux  bonhomme' 1 
who has learnt from the Bakuninists how to manipulate people on the 
sly while making out that it is he himself who is being manipulated. 
One of these days you will see that I am right. 
4. Stock exchange tax. Has long existed here in England in the 
form of a simple, everyday stamp on the transfer document — '/2 % °f 
the amount paid and 5/- transfer fee (securities au porteur A are rare 
over here; they are free). The only consequence is that the  real  specu­
lation on the stock exchange is in margin dealings where no actual 
transfer takes place. Hence only affects the so-called 'solid capital in­
vestment'. Nor has anything ever been devised that the stock market 
speculators cannot circumvent. 
I am against it, 1. because we, after all, demand only direct taxa­
tion, rejecting any that is indirect, so that the people may know and 
sense what they are paying, and also so that capital can be got at in 
this way, 2. because we certainly cannot vote one penny to this gov­
ernment. 
You are right in describing the outcry against the stock exchange 
as petty-bourgeois. The stock exchange simply adjusts the distribution 
of the surplus value  already stolen  from the workers, and how that is do­
ne may at first be a matter of indifference to the workers as such. 
However the stock exchange adjusts this distribution in the direction 
a See this volume, pp. 324-25.-b  Süddeutsche  Post- c Shifty customer- d to bearer

of centralisation, vastly accelerates the concentration of capitals and 
is therefore as revolutionary as the steam engine. 
Equally petty-bourgeois, though perhaps just excusable, are taxes 
with a moral purpose — beer, spirits. In this context they are quite 
ludicrous and altogether reactionary. Had the stock exchange 
in America not created colossal fortunes, how would large-scale 
industry and a social movement have been possible in that land of 
farmers? 
It would be quite a good idea if you were to lash out here. But with 
circumspection. There must be no gap in one's defences where your 
Stoeckers are concerned. 
5. 3rd edition of Capital.227  Will doubtless take some time yet as 
Marx is still ailing. His stay in Ventnor, where it rained continuously, 
did him no good. On top ofthat there has been the loss of  his daugh­
ter. 4 9 ° He has been back here for the past 3 weeks and is so hoarse 
that he can barely speak, so not much could be discussed (only don't 
mention this in the paper,a of course). 
6. We should be grateful for the Rodbertus-Meyer book.b 
At one time the man was almost on the point of discovering 
surplus value, but his estate in Pomerania prevented him from 
doing so. 
Very many thanks for the photograph. 
Kautsky has sent me his pamphlet on American grain. Choice 
irony: 3 years ago the population was to be reduced because it would 
otherwise have nothing to eat; now the population does not even  suf­
fice to eat what America produces!495 That's what happens when 
you study so-called 'questions' one by one without linking them 
together. In so doing you naturally fall victim to that dialectic which 
'is objectively present', Diihring notwithstanding, 'in things them­
selves'. 496 
I am delighted to hear that the Hohenzollern family again boasts 
a professing pederast. It would not bè complete without one. Admit­
tedly Prince Karl, like Frederick William II, also 'operated' in that 
line, but he also included women. That reminds me, did Adolf Beust 
give you Mirabeau's  Secret  History of  the Court of  Berlin"  which I gave 
him to pass on to you? If not, get hold of it. The book is inimitable on

IN ZURICH 
London, 10 February 1883 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I respectfully confirm mine of yesterday's date" and herewith 
enclose a letter for Kautskyb whose old address may no longer be 
any good. 
To come back to the stock exchange tax, there is absolutely no 
need for us to deny the 'immorality' and rascality of that exchange; 
we can even paint a really lurid picture of it as the spearhead of capi­
talist gain where ownership becomes directly synonymous with theft, 
but then go on to conclude that it is by no means in the interests of the 
proletariat to destroy this immaculate spearhead of the present econ­
omy; rather it should be allowed to deploy perfectly freely, so that 
even the most stupid can see where the present economy is taking 
them. We shall leave moral indignation to those who are avaricious 
enough to have recourse to the stock exchange without themselves 
being stock exchange men and who, as is only right, are cleaned out. 
And then if the stock exchange and 'solid business' come to blows and 
if the country Junkers, who also seek to dabble in securities and are 
inevitably fleeced, make a third in the three-sided battle between the

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN VIENNA 
London, 10 February 1883 
Dear Mr Kautsky, 
At long last I can get round to answering you and thanking you for 
the various things you have sent. You have no idea of the way im­
pediments of all kinds have prevented me, not only from working, but 
also from attending to the most urgent correspondence. Since Marx 
has been ill the burden has fallen upon myself alone and, on top of 
that, the number of inquiries, etc., has doubled. Moreover, I cannot 
very well write in the evenings because it tires my eyes and interferes 
with my sleep. Thus all written work is dependent on the few — in 
wintertime here, all too short — hours of daylight and, in view of the 
distances one has to cover here, a single trip into town will, as often as 
not, disrupt one's entire working day. And some fine to-ing and fro-
ing I have had to do of late! 

=====第465页=====
241. Engels to Kautsky. 10 February 1883 437 
Enough of that. I have not yet seen Die Neue  %eit.  But I shall write 
to Dietz today. I must have  street  and house number  if I am to send the 
subscription per money order; that's the rule here. 
Your treatise on American food production is most timely. The fact 
that you make such use of the information supplied by Mr Meyer 
must have made him very proud. 49? Is he still in Vienna, and do you 
still see him from time to time? 
But what irony of  history!  3 or 4 years ago you, a  neonato*  Malthu-
sian, were advocating the necessity of restricting the population by 
artificial means, because otherwise the time would soon come when 
we should none of us have enough to eat. And now you prove that the 
population is not even large enough to consume America's surplus 
food production as well as what Europe herself produces. Solve, 
I pray, Count Oerindur, this conundrum posed by nature!b Presuma­
bly, then, it won't be rations that are withheld, but rather that much-
vaunted little sponge! Which is not to say, of course, that this same or 
some other method might not be of great practical use in middle-class 
families to keep the number of children proportionate to income, and 
prevent the wife's health being ruined by too frequent 
confinements, etc. But I still maintain that this is a private matter be­
tween husband and wife, or at most the family doctor (in one such 
case I myself recommended what you call the 'Raciborski method'), 
and that our proletarians will continue as before to live up to their 
name by producing numerous proles.c 
It will not surprise you to learn that my standpoint in regard to 
your article on hetaerism498 still remains the same, namely that com­
munity of wives (and of men for women) was the basis for sexual rela­
tions within the tribe. The psychological argument against this, de­
riving from jealousy, interpolates more recent views, and is disproved 
by countless facts (some of which below). Darwin is no more of an au­
thority in this field than in that of political economy, whence he im­
ported his Malthusianism. We know practically nothing about apes 
in this respect, since observations in a menagerie prove nothing and 
are difficult to make in the case of a troop of wild apes, while such as 
are alleged to have been made cannot claim to be accurate, conclu­
sive or even universally valid. Gorillas and orang-outangs must in 
any case be excluded, since they do not live in troops. Those primitive 
tribes you adduce, with a loose form of monogamy, are, in my view, 
a new born-b  A. Müllner, Die  Schuld,  Act 2, Scene 5.- c progeny 

=====第466页=====
438 241. Engels to Kautsky. 10 February 1883 
degenerate, as Bancroft has shown of the Californians of the peninsu­
la. a Proof of primitivity is provided, not by barbarism, but by the de­
gree of integrity of ancient tribal blood ties. These, therefore, must 
first be established in each individual instance before conclusions can 
be drawn from individual manifestations in this tribe or that. For in­
stance, in the case of the peninsular Californians, these ancient ties 
have become very much looser, nor has any other organisation come 
to take their place; a sure sign of degeneracy. But even these argue 
against you. For amongst them, too, the women periodically revert to 
concubinage. And this is a crucial point though you do not so much 
as mention it. Just as it may be confidently inferred that, wherever,— 
e.g. with the Hutzwang* 99—the land periodically reverts to com­
mon ownership, there will once have been complete common owner­
ship of land, so too, I believe, one may confidently conclude that 
there has originally been community of wives wherever women — 
symbolically or in reality — periodically revert to concubinage. And 
this happens, not only amongst your peninsular Californians, but also 
amongst many other Indian tribes, not to mention the Phoenicians, 
Babylonians, Indians, Slavs and Celts, either symbolically or in real­
ity; hence it is very ancient and widespread and entirely refutes the 
psychological argument based on jealousy. I am curious to see how, 
in due course, you will contrive to overcome this obstacle, for you 
cannot after all omit all mention of it. 
Here comes Pumps with her husband and childb and that means 
no more writing. This is always happening. 
With kindest regards, 
Yours,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
IN PARIS 
London, 16th February 1883 
My dear Laura, 
I begin this letter — 4 p. m.— uncertain when I may be able to fin­
ish it, the constant interruptions I have lately been subjected to leave 
me no quiet time except at night and then I dare not write much, as 
that affects my eyes. 
Your Salas y Gomez* is on the whole a masterpiece. There is the 
same roughness of language as in the original — roughness as we like 
it in young good red wine,  gesunde  Herbigkeit, b and which makes Cha-
misso's terzine come nearer to Dante's than those of any other poet. 
I compared it with the original line for line and am astonished at the 
fidelity of the reproduction. Still I would wish you to try and alter 
a few passages so as to make it perfect. The end, you say  yourself,  is 
hurried and so indeed it is. But for details. 
Introduction.  Terz. 3. Thus towered it — it could not 'tower' while it 
could only be descried from the mast-head.—  From  the Ruric: impossi­
ble, because Chamisso himself was on board the Ruric. 
Terz. 5. I think wants re-moulding. Den Versuch  zu wagen" applies 
merely to the risk of getting the boats safely through the breakers 
caused by coral reefs which encircle all islands in those latitudes. 
Terz. 7, 3. One syllable short, our cannot be used bisyllabic. 
Terz. 15. The translation: albeit ... that might obliterate, is open to 
misleading. The original says clearly that it is the men's own steps 
that have obliterated the writing. 
Terz. 31, 1. This cold rock will never do while it burns his feet 
through his soles. 
1st Tablet. Terz. 1. Ich sah bereits im  Geiste*  — that cannot be sup­
pressed in the beginning. The reader, from the translation, must be­

treasures, and only at the end, Terz. 8, there is an indication, and 
that, after the previous omission, not strong enough, that all this was 
a mere fancy-dream. The character of the adventurous seafarer in 
quest of wealth forms the basis of the whole piece, and ought there­
fore to come out strong from the beginning of the story. 
Terz. 4, 1 : and for myself too were content and gain, is not to be 
understood without reference to the original. a 
Terz. 9, 3: the  cabins  gives a syllable too much in the verse, and is 
not literal. Der untre  Raum is in ship's language the  hold,  and moreover 
monosyllabic. 
2nd Tablet. Not a fault to find except one and that is one in copying. 
Terz. 16, 1: For they (have) sighted me, the have is omitted. 
3rd Tablet. Terz. 7. 'Worser far' I prefer, but will the philistine 
public? And will you turn philistine enough to say 'worse by far'? 
Terz. 15-20: your own variations indicate that you are not quite 
satisfied with your work. I do believe that here a fresh attempt might 
be made with advantage. The conclusion again is very good. 
As usual the beginning, when one is not yet  recht  im £ug, b and the 
end when one gets tired a little, are the weak points, but I think after 
you have had it laid aside for a time, you will be able to go at it again 
with fresh vigour and make it what indeed you can make it. 
Mohr wants to read it too, but not yet. Latterly he has had very 
bad sleepless nights which have broken down his intellectual appe­
tite, so that he began to read, instead of novels, publisher's cata­
logues. However the night before last was good and he was quite 
another man yesterday; another good symptom: his feet, previously 
ice-cold in the evening and only to be warmed by hot mustard-baths, 
for the last two nights were quite warm and no baths required. The 
chronic inflammation of the larynx and bronchiae is slowly becoming 
subdued, but swallowing still painful and the voice very hoarse. 
I shall continue to-night after I have seen him. His appetite was very 
good yesterday, Nimc surpasses herself in inventing new dishes for his 
case.

pretty much as usual, but he had given up the catalogues and re­
turned to Frédéric Soulié, anyhow a good sign. What do you say to 
this, that he drinks a pint of milk a day, he who could not bear milk to be 
on the table! Anyhow it does him good. Besides rum now and then (in 
the milk especially) he takes a bottle of brandy about every four days. 
The worst is that his case is so complicated that while the most 
pressing things, the breathing organs, have to be attended to, and 
now and then a sleeping draft is to be given, other things have to be 
neglected, for instance the stomach which is as you know none of the 
most perfect organs of digestion. But still his appetite keeps up pretty 
well, and we do our best to supply him such food chiefly as contains 
much nourishment in a small compass. 
I think our friends have been in too great a hurry with the new 
Egalité.  What is to become of the paper if Paul a and Guesde get 'time to 
serve' at Moulins, and that is after all not quite impossible? 440 
Guesde's opening articleb  is not at all what it should be. What he says of 
judges elected by universal suffrage, is quite as applicable to universal 
suffrage  itself,  to the Republic, to any political institution. If  Messieurs 
les français do not know how to use this universal suffrage tant pis  pour 
eux. c Give our people in Germany the right to elect the judges and 
they will carry the election in all large towns and make Berlin too 
hot a shop for old William and Bismarck, unless they have recourse to 
a coup d'état. But to say: white because my adversary says: black, is 
simply subir la loi de son  adversaire,  et une politique de  bébés. d I am afraid 
Guesde's old anarchist rodomontades are cropping up again rather 
fast, and in that case he will lose  himself.  Paul's deux  embêtés'  50° are 
charming. That is just his line.'

243 
ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 501 
IN ZURICH 
London, 27 February 1883 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
I recently had a little dispute with Viereck which has forced me to 
break with him. As he might possibly come to Zurich for the con­
gress 502 and make use of the occasion to mention the matter in  private 
conversation, I am concerned lest in that event his version be the only 
one to go the rounds. I therefore authorise you to read this letter to 
anyone Viereck may discuss the matter with, but at all events to 
Bebel and Liebknecht. 
Some little while before Christmas Viereck, or rather his wife, a sent 
me the visiting card of one Deinhardt, a Munich engineer, with three 
questions of a chemico-physico-industrial nature and asked me to get 
hold of the information if possible. I sent the card to Schorlemmer in 
Manchester who rightly suspected from the questions a pushful and 
importunate inventor and for good measure appended a 'motto' to 
his extremely terse reply. Here is the card as returned to Viereck: 
'1. Has ozone come into use alongside chlorine and chloride of lime for bleaching 
rags in English paper mills? — No. 
'2. Compared with other bleaching agents, does ozone offer a manufacturing 
concern any noteworthy advantages in a technical or financial sense? — No. 
'3. Is the production and use of ozone in an industrial concern attended by 
considerable difficulties? — Tes. 
'C. Deinhardt, Engineer (printed on card). 
'Motto: Apage inventor/'b 
In this form the card went back. So if Viereck did not wish to show 
Deinhardt the motto, all he had to do was copy questions and 
answers onto a sheet of paper or a postcard, and that would have 
been that. 
Next I received No. 7 (17 January) of the  Süddeutsche  Post (which 
Viereck sent me in exchange for The Labour Standard) and, in the 
'Letter Box', saw the following: 
'To Mr Deinhardt, engineer of this city. The author of the 'electrotechnical revo­
lution' writes to tell us that,  despite information  to the  contrary supplied  by Prof.  Schorlemmer, 
* Laura Viereck- b Be off with you, inventor! 

=====第471页=====
243. Engels to Bernstein. 27 February 1883 443 
of Manchester, he must stand by his contention that the  production  of ozone  would be 
effected by means of  a dynamo, etc' 
What was the meaning of this? How was it that this purely private 
piece of information found its way into the paper rather than into 
a proper letter box? And how could Viereck have had the impudence 
to make public use in his paper of private information supplied by 
Schorlemmer for Deinhardt — on Viereck's own evidence an ex­
tremely importunate man — purely to oblige Viereck? Either Viereck 
didn't know what he was doing or he did it out of revenge for the 
'motto'. 
But there is nothing whatever in the 3 questions and answers that 
turns on whether the production of ozone is effected by means of a 
dynamo; a dynamo is not mentioned at all. Thus, by indirectly 
attributing to Schorlemmer a statement actually denying that the 
production of ozone is effected with a dynamo, Viereck is guilty of 
outright falsification; he is attributing to Schorlemmer things he has 
never said. But obviously it cannot be a matter of indifference to a 
chemist whose reputation extends beyond Europe if someone attributes 
to him things about chemico-physical questions he has never said, and 
does so publicly in the university city of Munich where, after all, there 
are also chemists and physicists who might possibly read it. 
So I sent the paper, as was only my duty, to Schorlemmer who sent 
me the following letter for Viereck: 
'If anyone' (I am quoting from memory) 'publishes a private communication 
without permission, then it is improper. But if in addition he goes on to distort the said 
communication, then it is barely ethical.' 
Accordingly Schorlemmer called for the publication of the card as 
it stood, with questions, answers and motto, in order that the matter 
might be clarified. 
Whereupon a long letter arrived from Viereck addressed to me. 
Deinhardt, he said, had bombarded him with three letters on the sub­
ject of ozone (so the Apage inventor was wholly  appropriate^.).  By 
sending him [Viereck] the above-mentioned letter I was now holding 
a pistol to his head {which is  untrue,  let him show it to you; all I did was 
demand in polite terms full satisfaction for Schorlemmer), while 
Schorlemmer's letter and the demands made therein were even more 
intemperate. He could not, he added, publish the motto (needless to 
say this request was not intended seriously) and the remainder only if 
Schorlemmer withdrew the insulting expressions contained in his let­
ter; for the time being he could not admit having made a mistake, but 

=====第472页=====
444 243. Engels  to Bernstein.  27 February  1883 
must refuse  to accede  to our  peremptory demands  in 'this entirely  un-
qualifiable form'. 
'/ did not  even  know,''  his letter goes  on, 'that  Prof.  Schorlemmer read  the Süddeutsche 
Post and surely cannot  in any  circumstances assume that  you had  sent  him  this issue ad 
hoc'. For I  regard  it ... as out of the  question that  you  could inform against  me and 
I should have been only  too pleased  had you  suggested what steps ought  to have been 
taken  to pacify  the  much agitated professor.'  ... "/12 of his  readers consisted  of party 
members  ... nothing ought  to be  imputed  to him  that  was  'inconsistent with  the con­
duct of a man of  honour',  etc. 
So they make improper  use of  Schorlemmer's name  and, on  their 
own admission,  distort what  he says because they hope he won't find  out. 
And when  I, the  sole cause  of his involvement  in the  affair, tell  him 
about  it, then  I am  'informing' against Viereck.  Not Schorlemmer  but 
Viereck  is the  injured party, because Schorlemmer characterises 
Viereck's conduct,  and  with great restraint  at that.  Not a  word about 
the falsification  of which Schorlemmer  was the  victim. 
Well, Viereck  may  read  our  reply  to anyone  he chooses.  We  sent 
him a statement, addressed  not to him but to the  editorial board,  i. e. 
a statement intended  for publication, together with  a request that  at 
the same time they print questions  and  answers. What does Viereck 
do? First,  a polite apology  in the  'Letter  Box', to wit: 
'We profoundly regret this tiresome misunderstanding'  and  promise  to put the 
matter right. 
And then?  In No. 17, 9  February: 
'In regard  to the  electrotechnical  revolution.  On  being consulted,  Prof.  Schorlemmer  of 
Manchester supplied  the  following information which  we herewith print  in order  to 
clear  up a (!)  misunderstanding  (!)': (the  questions  and  answers follow). 
The clarification  of this 'misunderstanding'  is tantamount  to the 
total obfuscation  of the  affair,  as is  satisfaction  for Schorlemmer  to 
attempted mockery  and to  further misuse  of his  name. Thereafter  I 
returned  the  Süddeutsche  Post unopened.  Yet  another postcard from 
Viereck, asking what  he had  done  to deserve being rebuffed  in this 
insulting (everything  is insulting!)  way, etc.  What  I said  in my  reply  — 
also per postcard  — he can  read  to you  himself  if he  likes.  'One  must

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 7 
IN ZURICH 
London, 27 February 1883 
Dear Mr Bernstein, 
Your letter received yesterday evening.503  The Egalité has gone 
phut again and I would ask you to publish the following facts (see en­
closed slip of paper) in the Sozialdemokrat. 504 Let us hope that the 
chaps will finally learn some sense and not go founding daily papers 
on the strength of contracts of this kind. Taking legal action is 
a mug's game and costs money, and any French court of law would 
revel in non-suiting socialists and losing them their case, while the 
paper would still remain defunct. 
Guesde and Lafargue, amongst others, were arraigned 440 under 
Article 91 of the  Code  pénal '6 7 — conspiracy and incitement to civil 
war — death penalty. What a farce! 
At any rate, it's a good thing that they can no longer publicly de­
clare their solidarity with the anarchists, the latter being now behind 
bars — mere children who play with fire and, when given a hiding, try 
and make out they're the most innocent fellows in the world. And 
now some fool in Brussels sets off a bomb in his own trousers pocket! 
In due course dynamite will come to seem plain ridiculous. 
Now for a different tableau. Because of a dirty trick Viereck played 
on Schorlemmer in the  Süddeutsche  Post, I have broken with him. 
Further details are contained in a letter I have sent to Schorlemmer 1 
" See previous letter.

and which he, if he is agreeable, will send on to you tomorrow direct 
from Manchester (I have got it here, returned because I had forgot­
ten to sign it).a  I need hardly tell you that, when Viereck and 
Fritzsche were over here, they would have been given a very cool recep­
tion by us had they not come as the official emissaries of the party. As 
it was, however, and since Marx was exempted by his indisposition, 
I had to some extent to do them the honours. 505 Moreover, a certain 
intimacy grew up between his (Viereck's) present wifeb and my niece0 
(both of whom were then secretly engaged), etc., etc. At the same time 
I told him pretty plainly what I thought of his proclivity for vulgar 
democracy. In short, I became involved with him, but now it is all 
over. 
The veriest boot-black could not have tolerated the treatment 
meted out to Schorlemmer by Viereck. Yet Schorlemmer  is, after Marx, 
undoubtedly the most eminent man in the European socialist party. 
When I got to know him 20 years ago he was already a communist. 
At that time an impoverished private assistant to English professors, 
he is now a member of the ROYAL SOCIETY (the equivalent over here of 
the Akademie der Wissenschaften), and the world's leading authority in 
his own speciality, the chemistry of the simpler hydrocarbons  (paraf­
fin and its derivatives). His great Treatise on Chemistry, brought out 
jointly with Roscoe, d but written almost entirely by Schorlemmer (as 
all chemists know), is now without a rival in England and Germany. 
And this position he has carved out for himself abroad, in competi­
tion with men who exploited him for as long as they could, and he has 
done so entirely on the strength of genuinely scientific work, without 
ever making any concession to humbug. Moreover, he never hesitates 
to proclaim himself a socialist as, for instance, when he reads jokes 
aloud from the  Sozialdemokrat  for the benefit of the other lecturers with 
whom he is lunching; but he also demands, and justly so, that he 
should not have unwanted publicity, in whatever guise, thrust upon 
him, as was done by Viereck. But now, good-bye until tomorrow. It is 
almost midnight and I have broken my rule of not writing at night. 
28 February. There is, however, one favour I would ask of you, and 
that is not to keep chucking the word 'comrade' at me in the paper.e

To begin with, I detest anything that smacks of title-mongering and 
since, in all the German literature that counts for anything, people 
are called simply by their names and are not given titles unless under 
attack, we too should conform to this unless the designation 'com­
rade'  is really intended to inform the reader that the person con­
cerned belongs to the party. What is in place and normal on the 
platform and in verbal debate can look pretty awful in print. And 
then again, we here are not in fact 'comrades' in the narrower sense 
of the term. We can hardly be said to belong to the German party any 
more than to the French, American or Russian, nor can we regard 
ourselves as any more bound by the German programme 506 than by 
the minimum programme.6B We set no little store by this, our special 
position as representatives of  international  socialism. But it also pre­
cludes us from belonging to one particular national party — so long, 
that is, as we are unable to return to Germany and participate imme­
diately in the struggle there. Just now it would be pointless. 
What you say about Liebknecht's complicity in importing philistine 
elements has long been our view. For all his excellent qualities, Lieb­
knecht has one fault, namely the desire to attract 'educated' elements 
to the party by hook or by crook, and to him, a former teacher, the 
worst thing that can happen is for a working man in the Reichstag to 
say 'me' for T. A man like Viereck ought never to have been put up as 
a candidate. He would have exposed us in the Reichstag to far more 
deadly ridicule than would a hundred wrong 'mes' of which, after all, 
the Hohenzollerns and field marshals are likewise guilty. Unless the 
newcomers — the educated ones and those from bourgeois circles gen­
erally— adopt the proletarian standpoint  unreservedly,  they can do 
nothing but harm. But if they have genuinely adopted that stand­
point, then they are exceedingly useful and welcome. Another of 
Liebknecht's characteristics is that, for the sake of a momentary 
success, he will unhesitatingly sacrifice subsequent, more important 
successes. Thus Viereck and Fritzsche's highly dubious mission to 
America. 119 It went off reasonably well, but is there any knowing 
to what ridicule Fritzsche may not expose us later on in America? 
And then people will say: 'And there you have the representative 
of German Social Democracy in America, sent over officially!' 
And the caution one has to observe vis-à-vis this type of person 
when it comes to candidatures is evident from the Oppenheimer 
case. 507 
Yet another interruption!

1 March. We have always done our utmost to combat the narrow, 
petty-bourgeois philistine mentality within the party because, having 
developed since the Thirty Years' War,472 it has infected all classes 
in Germany, and has become a German hereditary ill, sister to servil­
ity and humble submissiveness and every German hereditary vice! 
This it is that has made us ridiculous and contemptible abroad. It is 
the chief cause of the slackness and weakness of character so prevalent 
in our midst. It prevails on the throne no less frequently than in 
a cobbler's lodging. Only since the time a modern proletariat took 
shape in Germany, only since then has a class developed there that is 
virtually untainted by this hereditary German scourge, a class which 
has given proof of clear-sightedness, energy, humour and tenacity in 
the fray. And can we be expected not to combat every attempt at ar­
tificially inoculating that healthy — in Germany, the only healthy — 
class with the old hereditary germ of philistine narrow-mindedness 
and philistine slackness? But during the first period of shock after the 
assassination attempts 120 and the Anti-Socialist Law, I6  the leaders 
fell prey to an anxiety which in itself  is proof of their having lived far 
too much amongst philistines and been subject to pressure from phil­
istine opinion. The idea at the time was that the party should, if not 
actually  become  philistine, at any rate  appear  to be so. That, I am glad 
to say, has now been overcome, but the philistine elements — these 
being particularly prevalent among university men, most of them 
incapable of passing their examinations — introduced in pre-Anti-
Socialist Law days are still there, and a close watch must be kept 
upon them. We are glad to have your assistance here and, being on 
the Sozialdemokrat, you are in a key position. 
But for goodness sake don't go raking up that wretched Jahrbuch 
article. a It was an apologia for the stock exchange men. But one can 
perfectly well be at one and the same time a stock exchange man and 
a socialist and therefore detest and despise the  class  of stock exchange 
men. Would it ever occur to me to apologise for the fact that I myself 
was once a partner in a firm of manufacturers? There's a fine recep­
tion waiting for anyone who tries to throw that in my teeth! 
And if I could be certain of making a million on the stock exchange 
tomorrow, and thus put an ample supply of funds at the disposal

of the party in Europe and America, to the stock exchange I should 
promptly go. 
What you say about courting the enemy's praise is perfectly right. 
We have often been infuriated by the glee with which the slightest 
sign, be it only a fart, of recognition from the armchair socialists82 
was recorded in the Volksstaat and the Vorwärts. It was the phrase, 
'We must exact recognition from the bourgeoisie in every sphere', 
that marked the beginning of Miquel's betrayal. 456 And however 
much Rudolf Meyer may butter us up,482  all the recognition he is 
likely to get in return is for his really meritorious Politische  Gründer.  * 
We never, of course, discussed serious topics with him, but confined 
ourselves almost entirely to Bismarck and the like. But Meyer is 
at least a decent fellow and one who is also quite capable of defying 
the aristos, nor is he ambitious like all the rest of the armchair 
socialists, who are now also flourishing in Italy; one specimen, Achille 
Loria, was over here recently but two calls on me were enough for 
him. 
In the case of Viereck, who knows absolutely nothing about the 
matter, the to-do over the electrotechnical revolution is merely an ad­
vertisement for the pamphlet he has published. 15 In fact, however, it's 
a tremendously revolutionary affair. The steam engine taught us to 
transform heat into mechanical motion, but the exploitation of elec­
tricity has opened up the way to transforming all forms of energy — 
heat, mechanical motion, electricity, magnetism, light — one into the 
other and back again, and to their industrial exploitation. The circle is 
complete. And Deprez's latest discovery, namely that electric currents 
of very high voltage can, with a comparatively small loss of energy, be 
conveyed by simple telegraph wire over hitherto undreamed­
of distances and be harnessed at the place of destination426  — 
the thing is still in embryo — this discovery frees industry for good 
from virtually all local limitations, makes possible the harnessing of 
even the most remote hydraulic power and, though it may benefit the 
towns at the outset, will in the end inevitably prove the most powerful 
of levers in eliminating the antithesis between town and country. 
Again, it is obvious that the productive forces will thereby acquire 
a range such that they will, with increasing rapidity, outstrip the con­
trol of the bourgeoisie. All Viereck sees in it, short-sighted as he is, is

a fresh argument in favour of his beloved nationalisation. What the 
bourgeoisie cannot do must be done by Bismarck. 
I'm sorry about the Schumacher business. Let's hope it's just 
a passing phase; he used to be such a lively, resolute chap. But, as 
you say, it's that damned German imperial atmosphere!508 
There are a great many reasons why I should not consider coming 
to the congress.502 Things being what they are just now on the Con­
tinent, I would sooner remain here. 
Kautsky has sent me his second piece on marriage498 in which he 
again tries to sneak in community of wives as a secondary manifesta­
tion. But that won't do. Indeed, I shall write to him about ita and en­
close the letter in one to you. It is Kautsky's misfortune that, in his 
hands,  complex questions do not resolve themselves into simple 
ones — rather, simple questions become complex. And then, it's 
impossible to achieve anything if one is so prolific. He ought to write 
popular stuff for the sake of the fee, and take his time over scientific 
matters, thus dealing with them in a considered and exhaustive 
way, which alone can be rewarding. 
The pederast, who made us laugh a great deal, has already been 
posted on to Manchester where he will be widely disseminated. 
Marx is still incapable of work, keeps to his room (he returned here 
immediately after his daughter's death 49°), and reads French novels. 
His case seems to be a very complicated one. My hopes are high, now 
that a better season is on its way. 
Yours,

the information I sent his wife c from time to time (he hardly ever

245 
ENGELS TO KARL'KAUTSKY 
IN VIENNA 
London, 2 March 1883 
Dear Mr Kautsky, 
I have received your second article on marriage498 and, since this 
contains your answer to my criticism of the first one,a I shall continue 
where I left off; I happen to have an hour to spare which will not be 
the case tomorrow. 
To begin with I consider it absolutely inadmissible that, having 
contested community of wives as a primary manifestation, you should 
seek to reintroduce it as a secondary one. Wherever common owner­
ship exists, be it of land, women or anything else, it will necessarily be 
primitive, a legacy of the animal kingdom. The subsequent process of 
development consists entirely in the gradual  dissolution  of this prime­
val common ownership; in no case do we find an instance of second­
ary common ownership evolving out of primitive private ownership. 
So irrefutable and universally valid do I consider this proposition to 
be that, even were you to produce what appeared to be exceptions — 
and however striking these might be at first sight — I would not 
regard them as an argument to the contrary, but only as a question 
yet to be solved. 
Moreover, having made jealousy the one decisive factor in the first 
article, you ought not to discard it entirely in the second. Article I 
presupposes a loose form of monogamy, and this very largely on the 
strength of jealousy for, as I have said, your other reasons carry very 
little weight with me. But if jealousy is able to overcome natural 
community of sexes — and you do after all indirectly concede the 
existence of the latter when you say: 'Within the tribe  complete  sexual 
licence  prevailed' —if jealousy can relegate that natural licence to the 
confines of temporary monogamy, how much more easily must it be 
able to overcome lesser obstacles. The tribe's common ownership of 
captives is, however, an obstacle of much less magnitude. A woman 
remains a woman, whether she is free or a slave; true, in the case of 
See this volume, pp. 437-38. 

=====第480页=====
452 245. Engels to Kautsky. 2 March 1883 
female slaves, a man's jealousy is able to impose sole possession much 
more easily than in the case of free women who have a right to adul­
tery! But the moment there is any question of marriage with captives, 
the jealousy of the husbands suddenly evaporates; the community of 
sexes which so appalled them in the primitive state, becomes accept­
able and pleasing and, even after monogamy or polygamy has 
already been introduced, even in the case of Semitic peoples where 
harems are the rule, husbands do not object to their wives coupling 
with every Tom, Dick and Harry, either in the temple or at special 
seasons. No, my dear fellow, you can't dismiss the thing as easily as all 
that. For you are duty-bound to stick to the point even when it be­
comes awkward for you to do so. If primary community of sexes was 
inhibited by jealousy, then community of sexes is excluded once and 
for all, right down to and including capitalist society. Either your 
second article refutes the first or vice versa. 
Incidentally, I would contest your statement that the freedom of 
women, at your first stage, contributed to monogamy because there 
could be no question of repression. The argument that community of 
sexes is dependent on repression is itself false and a modern distortion 
arising out of the idea that common ownership in the sexual sphere 
was only of women by men and at the latter' s pleasure.  This is totally fo­
reign to the primitive state. Common ownership in this sphere was 
available to  both  sexes. To refute the false assumption, however, is not 
the same thing as refuting the correct facts on which the distortion is 
based. 
Again, by reducing all community of sexes and traces thereof to 
marriage by rapine with foreign women, you attribute to that form of 
marriage,  qua  predominant form, a really vast range. Yet you adduce 
not the slightest proof of this. 
What follows is lost in a welter of hypotheses [among them much]a 
that is undoubtedly correct [in regard to specific times  and] a places. 
But you generalise at the speed of an express train, whereas questions 
of this kind do not lend themselves to such rapid despatch. And while 
the Celtic clan, the Roman gens and the German  Geschlecht  are, it is 
true,  all sub-divisions of the tribe, they all have very marked differ­
ences and also, surely, different origins. As do the various kinds of 
clan amongst non-Celtic peoples. 
I am convinced that, should you pursue these studies or resume 
a Ms. damaged.

them after a lapse of time, you will arrive at quite different conclu­
sions and, perhaps, regret your premature endeavours in this difficult 
field. You have done some hard slogging, but you have leapt too rap­
idly to conclusions, at the same time laying too much weight on the 
opinions of self-styled anthropologists, all of whom have what I might 
call a certain obliquity reminiscent of your armchair socialist.82 
While you may refute Bachofen's deification and mystification of 
community of sexes,a this is not to say that community of sexes does 
not and will not continue to exist.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL

London, 7 March 1883 
Dear Bebel, 
I shall have to reply to you from memory today as I must have left 
your letter with Marx, but first of all I should like to congratulate you 
on your release the day after tomorrow.  4 °5 
The rapid advances in German industry you have described please 
me enormously. What we are now experiencing is the second Bona-
partist empire in all its aspects: the stock exchange is mobilising all 
capitals that are still wholly or partially idle by attracting them and

rapidly concentrating them in a few hands; the capitals thus made 
available to industry are ushering in an industrial boom (which is by 
no means necessarily the same thing as a high level of business activity) 
and, once the affair gets going, it will continue to accelerate. Only two 
things distinguish the era of Bismarck from the era of Bonaparte III: 
The latter owed its prosperity to what was relatively free trade; the 
former is making headway despite protective tariffs that are wholly 
uncalled for, particularly in Germany. And, secondly, the Bis-
marckian era is putting far more people out of work. This is partly be­
cause the increase in population is much greater in our case than in 
that of France where two children are the rule, partly because Bona­
parte, thanks to his building operations in Paris, generated an artifi­
cial demand for labour, whereas in our case the milliard era '69 came 
to an early end; but again it must partly be due to other causes about 
which I am not clear. At all events philistine Germany is at last 
becoming a modern country, and that is absolutely vital if we are 
to make rapid progress. 
When one reads the German bourgeois papers and the speeches in 
the Chamber one might imagine that one was living in the England 
of Henry VII and VIII; the same complaints about danger from vag­
rants,  the same outcry for the forcible suppression of vagrancy — the 
cachot*  and the lash. Here is the best proof of how rapidly the pro­
ducers are losing touch with their means of production, of how rap­
idly the smaller enterprises are being supplanted by the machine and 
the perfecting of the machine. But what could be more ludicrous 
and despicable than those bourgeois who hope that moral sermons and 
penal methods sermons will enable them to do away with the inevitable 
consequences of their own actions. It is a crying shame that you are 
not in the Reichstag 222; this is a theme that would be right up your 
street. 
The precedent you set in the Saxon Landtag by calmly taking the 
oath509 has had its imitators. The Italians have unanimously de­
clared that the oath need not be a stumbling-block and Costa took the 
oath without demur.420 And, after all, these are people who declare 
themselves to be 'anarchists', even though they vote and are elected 
by vote!

will clarify much of Maurer for you; the man's writing is atrociously 
slipshod but the content is excellent. I have read the book 5 
or 6 times and shall reread it next week after I have again been

by him for the worse/better. If you haven't got his edition I can send 
you one; after all, you had better see what the Americans think you 
ought to look like. 
Now I must close, for I must go and see Marx whose health is 
still not really making the progress it should. If it were two months 
from now, the warmth and air would do their work but as it is 
there's a north-east wind, a storm almost, with flurries of snow, so 
how can a man expect to cure himself of a long-standing case of

IN PARIS

My dear Laura, 
Not having received a letter from Paula this morning, I conclude 
that in this frosty and snowy weather with east wind, you will not be 
in too great a hurry to come to London. Anyhow, if you should make 
up your mind to come, everything is prepared for you. 
Donkin saw Mohr yesterday evening and I am glad to say gave 
a far more favorable account of his health than a fortnight ago. He 
said Mohr was decidedly not worse, but better, if anything, than 
then; and if we could keep him up for the next two months, there 
would be a good chance of bringing him round again. Of course he is 
still getting weaker, on account of the difficulty of swallowing, but we 
must  force him to eat and drink. This is what Tussy wrote me on a post­
card last night and what Nimb told me today; I shall see Tussy to­
night and if any more details are to be had shall write again at once. 
The abscess in the lungs he considers to be going on very favorably at 
present. The nocturnal sweats have now ceased the last 4 nights (or 5) 
but instead of that there is a certain feverishness in the day-time 
which of course is also weakening. 
He gave me the  Prolétaire  and the reply of Guesde's Committee, as 
well as the lvW c  number of the Citoyen and Bataille which I am to 
keep for him. The copy sent by Paul can therefore with the rest be 
used for Zurich. d So this time the business part of the affair can be at­
tended to, fortunately, but with Mohr's present state of health, that 
cannot always be reckoned upon if he be in exclusive possession of the 
materials. 
These ex-Bakounists Malon and Brousse are a beastly dirty lot. 
Such barefaced forgery would be enough, anywhere out of Paris, to

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 512 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 14 March 1883 
Dear Liebknecht, 
You will all have learned from my telegram to Mrs Bebel284 — the 
only address I have got — of the terrible loss suffered by the European 
socialist revolutionary party. Only last Friday the doctor" — one of 
the leading medical men in London — had told us that there was 
every prospect of getting him as well as he had ever been, provided 
only he sustained his strength by taking food. And from that very mo­
ment he began eating with a better appetite again. Then, just after 
two o'clock this afternoon, I found the household in tears and was 
told he was terribly weak; Lenchen called out to me to come upstairs, 
saying he was half asleep, and, when I got there — she had been out 
of the room for barely two minutes — he was sound asleep, but it was 
for ever. The greatest intellect of the second half of this century had 
ceased to think. What the immediate cause of death was, I would not 
venture to guess without medical advice, the whole case being so 
complex as to require pages if it were to be described adequately, 
even by a doctor. And, indeed, it is no longer of any real importance. 
I have suffered anxiety enough over the past six weeks, and all I can 
say is that, in my opinion, the death, first of  his wife,513 and then, in 
a most critical period, of Jenny,490 helped to bring on the final crisis. 
Although I have seen him this evening laid out on his bed, his fea­
tures rigid in death, I simply cannot conceive that this man of genius 
has ceased to fructify the proletarian movement of both worlds with 
his stupendous ideas. We all of us are what we are because of him; 
and the movement is what it is today because of his theoretical and 
practical activities; but for him we should still be in a welter of confu­
sion.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 5 '2 
IN ZURICH 
London, 14 March 1883 
Dear Bernstein, 
You will have got my telegram.284 The thing happened frightfully 
quickly. Our hopes were at their highest when, this morning, his 
strength suddenly failed him, after which he simply fell asleep. 
Within two minutes this intellect of genius had ceased to think, and 
at precisely the moment when we had been encouraged by the 
doctors to entertain the highest hopes. Only someone who constantly 
kept company with him could have any idea of how valuable this 
man was to us in regard to theory and also, at every critical moment, 
in regard to practice. Along with him, his great breadth of vision will 
also disappear from the stage for years to come. These are things we 
others are not equal to. The movement will continue on its way but it 
will miss the calm, timely, considered interventions which have hith­
erto saved it many a weary digression. 
More shortly. It is now midnight and I have had to spend the en­
tire afternoon and evening writing letters and seeing to all manner of 
things. 
Yours, 
F.E.

London, 15 March 1883 
Dear Old Man, 
Rejoice that you saw Marx once more last autumn,5 '4 you will 
never see him again. Yesterday afternoon, at 2.45, when he had been 
left on his own for barely two minutes, we found him peacefully 
asleep in his chair. The most powerful intellect our party possessed had 
ceased to think, the stoutest heart I have ever known was beating no 
more. An internal haemorrhage would seem to be indicated. 
We two are now pretty well all that is left of the old guard of the 
days before '48. Well, we shall continue to man the breach. Though 
bullets may whistle and friends fall, it won't be the first time we two 
have seen that happen. And if one of us is hit by a bullet — well and 
good, provided only it is properly lodged so that one isn't left writh­
ing for too long. 
Your old comrade in arms,

Dear Sorge, 
Your telegram arrived this evening. Many thanks. 
To keep you regularly informed about Marx's state of health was

253. Engels to Sorge. 15 March 1883 461 
impossible because of his perpetual ups and downs. But here, briefly, 
are the main facts. 
In October '81, shortly before the death of his wife,513  he went 
down with PLEURISY. Having recovered from that, he was sent to 
Algiers in February '82 and, the weather during the journey being wet 
and cold, arrived there suffering from another bout of PLEURISY. The exe­
crable weather persisted; he had only just recovered when, because of 
the approach of hot summer weather, he was sent to Monte Carlo 
(Monaco). Arrived there suffering from another, though milder, bout 
of PLEURISY. Further execrable weather. Cured again at last, he went to 
Argenteuil near Paris, to stay with his daughter, Madame Longuet. 
There he availed himself of the nearby sulphur springs at Enghien for 
the treatment of his long-standing bronchitis. And there, too, the 
weather continued to be really appalling, but the cure did some good. 
Next, 6 weeks in Vevey, whence he came back here in September, ap­
parently almost restored to health. He had been authorised to spend 
the winter on the south coast of England. And he himself was so sick 
of a wandering and idle life that renewed exile in southern Europe 
would probably have damaged his morale as much as it would have 
benefited his physique. With the onset of London's foggy season he 
was sent to the Isle of Wight where it rained continuously and he 
again caught cold. Schorlemmer and I had intended to visit him ear­
ly in the New Year, but then reports reached us which necessitated 
Tussy's going there at once. Immediately afterwards came the news 
of Jenny's death 490—whereupon he came back here, again suffering 
from bronchitis. After all that had happened and at his age this spelt 
danger. On top ofthat there was a host of complications, in particu­
lar an abcess of the lung and a tremendously rapid loss of strength. 
Nevertheless, the illness as a whole was taking a favourable course, 
and only last Friday the doctor en  chef"  in whose hands he was — one 
of the leading younger doctors in London who had been specially re­
commended to him by Ray Lankester — held out the rosiest hopes. 
But anyone who has ever examined lung tissue under a microscope 
knows how great is the danger, when a lung is festering, of the wall of 
a blood vessel becoming perforated. And that is why, every morning 
for the past 6 weeks, as I turned the corner, I was mortally afraid 
that the blinds might have been lowered. Yesterday, at half past two 
in the afternoon, his best time for receiving visitors, I arrived to find 
Donkin

the household in tears; it seemed as if he was nearing his end. I asked 
for news, tried to get to the bottom of the matter and to offer consola­
tion. There had been a slight haemorrhage, followed, however, by 
a sudden collapse. Our good, old Lenchen,a who has looked after him 
better than a mother would after her child, went upstairs, came down 
again: he was half asleep, she said, and invited me to come up with 
her. When we went in, he lay there sleeping, never to wake again. His 
pulse and breathing had stopped. In the space of two minutes he had 
passed away painlessly and peacefully. 
All events, however terrible they may be, that come about with nat­
ural inevitability, bear within them their own consolation. So it was 
here.  The art of medicine might, perhaps, have been able to secure 
for him a few years of vegetable-like existence, the life of a helpless 
creature, not dying suddenly but inch by inch, a triumphant testi­
mony to the skill of the doctors. But that is something our Marx could 
never have stood. To live with so many uncompleted works before 
him, with the tantalising desire to complete them and the impossibil­
ity of doing  so — that would have been a thousand times more bitter 
for him than the gentle death that overtook him. 'Death is not a mis­
fortune for the one that dies but for the one that survives',b as he used 
to say with Epicurus. And to see this powerful man of genius continue 
to vegetate, a total wreck, for the greater glory of medicine and as 
a laughing-stock for the philistines whom, at the height of his powers, 
he had so often felled to the ground —  no! A thousand times better 
that it should be as it is, a thousand times better that we should bear 
him the day after tomorrow to the grave in which his wife lies sleep­
ing. 
And after all that had gone before, with which not even the doctors 
are as familiar as I am, there could, in my view, have been only one 
choice. 
Be that as it may. Mankind is the poorer for the loss of this intel­
lect— the most important intellect, indeed, which it could boast to­
day. The movement of the proletariat will continue on its course but 
it has lost its focal point, the point to which Frenchmen, Russians, 
Americans and Germans would automatically turn at moments of 
crisis,  on every occasion receiving clear, indisputable advice such as 
only genius and consummate expertise can give. Local bigwigs and 
lesser luminaries, if not imposters, will be given a free hand. Ultimate

victory remains assured, but the digressions, the temporary and local 
aberrations — already so inevitable — will now proliferate as never 
before. Well, we have got to see it through — what else are we here 
for? But we're not going to lose heart, for all that — not by a long

Dear Lessner, 
At three o'clock yesterday our old friend Marx went gently and 
peacefully to his eternal rest; the immediate cause of death was, or so 
we presume, an internal haemorrhage. 
The funeral will take place on Saturday3 at 12 noon, and Tussy 
asks you to attend.

Academy of Agriculture516; not having my address, they tele­
graphed the editorial department of The Daily Mews. Now they are 
asking me to let them know the price of the wreath and my address. 
But it is not signed with a name — merely: Students of the Petrovsky 
Academy in Moscow. 
To whom should I reply? Perhaps you could advise me. As the tele­
gram arrived after the burial, and the grave has today been re­
opened for the burial of Longuet's little boy" who died last Tues­
day,11 I shall not be able to lay the wreath on it till next week. But 
then I should like to let the worthy young men know that I have

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
IN PARIS

My dear Laura, 
Enclosed a letter from Meyer which was directed to Maitland 
Parka  — Tussy opened it without looking at the address, but when 
she saw from whom it was, she gave it at once to Nim b who handed it 
to me. 
To-day Nim found among Mohr's manuscripts a large parcel con­
taining the best part if not the whole of the second volume of the Capi­
tal221 — above 500 pages in folio. As we do not yet know in what 
state of preparation for the press it is, nor either what else we may 
find, it will be better to keep this piece of good news out of the press 
for the present. 
Pumps is expecting No. 2 daily and nightly if indeed it has not ar­
rived to-day — since Friday no news from her. No. Ie is a year old 
to-day. Jollymeier sends his love to you. Kind regards from both of us 
to Paul.d  Tell him that the last No. of the Sozialdemokrat contains 
but the report of the funeral' — the same essentially which was in the 
Justice. f 
The English and German press have been inexact and badly in­
formed but upon the whole decent. Even Malon was not so bad. 
Latest news. In walks Pumps and Percy8! So there the full 12 
months is happily passed. 
Most affectionately yours,

Your letter evoked roars of laughter over here.5  ' ' Anyone who 
knew Moor as he was at home and within his intimate circle, is aware 
that he was never called Marx there, or even Karl, but only Moor, 
just as each of us had his own nickname; indeed, at the point where 
nicknames ceased so too did the closest intimacy. Moor had been his 
nickname since his university days and on the Neue  Rheinische  Leitung 
he was always called Moor. If I had addressed him in any other way 
he would have thought something was amiss that needed putting 
right.

JENNY LONGUET TO CHARLES LONGUET 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 1 October 1880 
My dear Charles, 
I was well rewarded yesterday for spending without murmuring 
a most dreary evening — the evenings are getting so long and chill — 
by the arrival of your article. It gave me much pleasure for it is wittily 
written, and I rejoice to think that it will give much satisfaction to 
Liebknecht. Liebknecht is a great enthusiast with regard to rev­
olutionary France — so great an optimist indeed in this respect, that 
during the Franco-Prussian war etc. he even lost all discrimination in 
judging of Trouchu and Co.— therefore your praise of him in the Jus­
tice will sound like sweetest music to his ear and make him forget for 
a moment the troubles that lie so heavily upon him. He seems to me 
to be quite broken down by the last two years. With tears in his eyes 
he spoke to me of the struggles he and his family had passed through 
and which were yet in store for them. From all his sons he must part if 
he does not wish them to be shot or crippled, they must emigrate to 
America. 'My happiest time,' he said, 'was that spent in England' — 
and yet heaven knows, he did not lie on a bed of roses here! T often 
think of it with regret. But there was a fate that drove me to Germa­
ny, that has driven me on ever since and will shape my destiny to 
the end.— When I heard of the Amnesty, 518 my first thoughts were 
with you all — I already saw you hopelessly restlessly tossed on 
a small skiff on the wild ocean of  Paris.  But what must be must be.' To 
which I said Amen. There is a Providence (or rather a fate) that 
shapes our ends, rough-hew them as we  will!  — I quite agree with you in 
thinking that the men of the Commune should never forget how 
boldly the German socialists fought for the cause of the vanquished, 
and that therefore by writing your article you have paid a debt of 
gratitude, and I think now that if Bebel and Liebknecht have evinced 

=====第498页=====
470 1. Jenny Longuet to Charles Longuet. 1 October 1880 
less sympathy for the Nihilists 242 of Russia, it is because they have 
had altogether false notions on the subject and have had the misfor­
tune of meeting with a quantity of Russian humbugs calling them­
selves Nihilists, with which the Continent swarms. 
Fortunately for Liebknecht he has had his eyes opened now by 
Papa and Hartmann, who has interested him deeply and has shown 
him the importance of the Russian movement and the unparalleled 
grandeur of the true Nihilist heroes. The soi-disant* Nihilists that in­
fest the Continent, Hartmann said, are nearly always fellows whose 
only reason for leaving Russia is that they will not work, and that 
they can find ways and means to live without working elsewhere — 
numbers of them are not refugees. 
Pardon this endless letter in which I have not yet found time to 
mention that which lies nearest your heart. My object is to make it 
last until I shall hear the welcome sound of the postman's knock — 
shall get a letter from you, or read an article written by you. It is only 
since you are gone, my dear Charles, that I feel how dear you are to 
me and how lonely life would be without you! I was not quite well 
this morning and yesterday, having horrid fits of sickness — but when 
they are over I am all right again — my misgivings will come but too 
true!!!  The children are blooming like roses and I can see that Harryb 
is daily gaining strength. He begins to grow wonderfully fond of and 
interested in all that the  Wolf c does, and follows him about from 
room to room, calling for him when away. Little Edgar is a very sun­
beam of brightness, in his delightful joyousness he constantly reminds 
me of our poor little Carod and I tremble lest anything should happen 
to this lovely child — you alarmed me by telling me of your neural­
gia—I hope Tussy's cordial has spelled it away.

From JENNY LONGUET'S LETTER 
TO CHARLES LONGUET 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 27 October 1880 
... I was very glad to see that the notes on Eastern affairs are bear­
ing such good fruit. Pelletan of late has written the most childish trash 
on the subject, every line giving evidence of the darkest ignorance. 
Your article is written in the simple, clear, elegant style for which 
French prose is famous, and which makes the stuff of treaties go down 
quite pleasantly. But how is it you are so stingy? Why not send me 
four copies of your own articles always — or at least  three.  Now again, 
I have no number to send my correspondent Collet, who would send 
more matter, if he saw that some use was made of the information giv­
en. From Papa it is impossible to get a paper returned, besides if re­
turned, I could not send it to anyone, as it would be marked all over 
with blue pencil marks. That is the reason why I could not at once 
send your last article to Parnell. If he were to take an interest in the 
Justice — a great end would be gained. Notes direct from him would 
be invaluable at this crisis.5 '9 Your article on the Treaty of Ber­
lin, 376 Papa has not seen yet, therefore I cannot give you his opinion. 
He told me last Sunday, shocked at the ignorance displayed by Pelle­
tan on Eastern affairs, that he would order the 'blue books'89 and 
write to you himself on the subject. Good-bye.

From JENNY LONGUET'S LETTER 
TO CHARLES LONGUET 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 31 October 1880 
... I had the Justice with your two articles in it last night, and feel 
quite elated to see what excellent use you have made of the matter 
I sent you. Your article on the frontier must create a sensation, what 
you disclose is quite new in France, and even little known in England, 
because intentionally suppressed. And then the form you give to 
heavy stuff  is so amusing and sarcastic, that even the French reader 
will not consider the matter too dry. The pity is, that you always send 
me one copy, and that I am not able to send a paper to Collet, which 
would keep my correspondence with that short-armed but long­
sighted individual alive and procure for you an abstract of the in­
trigues now going on, and save you the trouble of reading blue 
books89  yourself:  I also want the first article3 on the Berlin Treaty376 
for Collet. Papa was greatly pleased with your article — he had 
often grumbled at childish notes in the Justice on the delays caused 
by the Turks etc.— delays in reality skilfully brought about by the 
Russians! Papa also liked your article on Girardin and relished the 
quotation sur le mâle et l'âne h from Proudhon. — But I am sure you 
relished still more the pleasure of quoting the name of your master 
than the quotation  itself!!!  Am I right? 
I am sorry to think you should have taken the trouble to translate 
what I sent you on Ireland. I never intended you to do that, fancying 
that you would take parts here and there and scribble down in an 
hour at most some sort of correspondence. As you make such a serious 
matter of it, I shall not send any more of my productions. They would 
only waste your time. My intention had been to save your time by 
reading much matter referring to Ireland for you. It is so long ago since 
I sent you my letter, that I do not remember what I wrote, but fancy 
the news will be too stale now. 
I have not read Roy's articles. Papa considers the second one to

JENNY LONGUET TO CHARLES LONGUET 
IN PARIS 
[London,] 23 November 1880 
My dear Charles, 
I was just going to write to Papa to ask him to send you a copy of 
the Capital, when I heard from Mama that a volume had already 
been sent you.a To-day, being Sunday, Johnny and I paid our usual 
visit at Maitland Parkb  (I have only time to go there once a week) 
and so I had at length an opportunity of asking Papa's opinion of 
your latest productions. He seemed very pleased at the publication of 
Bright's opinion on the Irish question, considering it most opportune 
and wondering how you had got hold of that interesting document. 
Liebknecht's letter he thinks will do really good service. You have 
made Liebknecht's style sound quite elegant, which is not its general 
characteristic. As to your own article in answer to Massard, Papa also 
much approved of it, though I must add that his praise is rather more 
qualified than was mine.— First, he does not agree with you as to the 
greatness of the fact of the 4 août, 520 declaring that a careful study of 
the history of that event diminishes it wonderfully in importance and 
shows that only minor points were conceded. As to the revolutionary 
side of the struggle for the limitation of the working day, he thinks

474 4. Jenny Longuet to Charles Longuet. 23 November 1880 
you have passed it over without notice in your answer to those revolu­
tionists of the fire and sword.— From the Capital you will see that the 
fight of the English working class assumed more than once the char­
acter of a revolution, and that the governing classes only granted 
what they dared not refuse. If Massard and Co. thirst for fight, they 
will derive much satisfaction by a perusal of the history in England of 
the limitation of the working day! Apropos, as to the question of the 
fixation of a minimum salary, it may perhaps interest you to know 
that Papa did all he could to persuade Guesde to omit it from their 
programme, 68 explaining to him that such a measure, if adopted, 
would, according to economical laws, produce the result of making of 
this fixed minimum a maximum. But Guesde stuck to it, on the plea 
that it would give them a hold on the working classes if it did nothing 
else. Guesde, you see, is opportunist like the rest of them." 
Papa is much surprised to see the want of judgment the French 
radical press is evincing in its treatment of General Farre who, he con­
siders,  acts like a man who knows that judged by his  compères*  Cissey 
would be saved, qu'ils  s'entendraient  comme  larronsen foire. c If the Press by 
its foolish noise gets Farre revoked, Papa thinks they will have lost 
the best man in the Gambettist camp. 
I have not yet received the promised series of your articles. As 
I suppose I shall have to wait for some time before you carry out that 
good intention of yours, will you in the meantime, nay by return of 
post, send me your last article containing Bright's letter, ...d

My darling little Jenny, 
Our trip went off wonderfully well, thanks to Helen's" energy and 
circumspection. I still don't know how she managed to drag all the 
BAGS AND BAGGAGES about or to cart this old bundle of bones from 
place to place. At Folkestone she actually contrived to get hold of 
a SLEEPING COUPÉ in which we lay and slept like in our own beds. At 
Boulogne I sent you and Moor a telegram. Moor never got his. 
What is more, the ship only sailed at 6 o'clock so we didn't arrive 
here until 11. I came upon Moor and Tussy COSY in the PARLOUR. 
Tussy propped up with cushions on the sofa. Her crazy mode of life 
has left her in such a weak and feverish state that she can walk no 
better than I do. Radford has proved a faithful friend. He brought 
her JELLIES and DAINTIES every day, took her out in CABS, rushed in 
despair to Mrs Anderson who, in her stead, sent another lady  WHO 
DID HER  NOT  MUCH  GOOD.  I trust the modern young Aesculapus [sic] will 
make an impression on her. Although I never ceased grieving for 
one moment at Argenteuil and left you IN TEARS AND SORROWS, the 
memory of you and your love and kindness remains nevertheless 
as the richest treasure of my heart, on which and I shall feed like 
a MISER. NO more, *as I am poor even in thanks. 
Poor Longuet! He frightened me quite. He looked so ill and stared 
at me with such big eyes. 
The darling Harry and my poor Johnny. He will not much regret 
old granny.* I was so unjust to the dear child when he rushed 
about screeching — a peculiarity of childhood and part of its hap­
piness. 
Adio.

NOTES 
1 On 18 August 1879, in Ramsgate, Marx's daughter Jenny Longuet gave birth to 
a son, Edgar.— 3 
2 The reference is to two trade unionists, Alexander Macdonald and Thomas 
Burt, who were elected to the House of Commons in 1874.— 3 
3 Bimetallism, the practice of using both gold and silver as a monetary standard by 
specifying that both constitute legal tender at a fixed ratio to each other. 
This practice existed in a number of countries in the 18th and 19th centuries but 
did not meet the needs of developed commodity economy and went against the very 
nature of money as the only commodity which was to be a universal equivalent. 
Liebknecht quoted from this letter by Engels in his speech in the Saxon Landtag 
on 16 January 1880, opposing a return to bimetallism. 
Engels analysed the issue of bimetallism in some detail also in his letter to Edu­
ard Bernstein of 10 May 1882 (see this volume, pp. 256-58).—3, 256 
4 A reference to Bismarck's visit to Austria in September 1879 and the Austro-
German alliance concluded in Vienna on 7 October of that year. Art. 1 of the 
treaty stipulated that, should one of the contracting parties be attacked by Russia, 
the other was obliged to come to its aid. Art. 2 stated that, should one of the signa­
tories be attacked by any other country, the other was to maintain benevolent 
neutrality. Should the aggressor have Russian support, Art. 1 was to apply. Con­
cluded for a term of five years and later repeatedly extended, this treaty was the first 
in a series of agreements that ultimately led to the establishment of a military bloc 
headed by Germany and to a division of the European countries into two hostile 
camps that subsequently clashed in the First World War.— 4 
5 The originals of this letter and that of 13 December 1879 (present edition, Vol. 45, 
p. 427) are kept in the family archive of Lord Walstone, who presented photocopies 
of them to the Institute of Marxism-Leninism in 1968. The addressee was Lord

Walstone's father, the English archaeologist Charles Walstone, who held his father's 
surname, Waldstein, at the time.— 5 
6 This letter is printed according to a handwritten copy made by an unknown per­
son. Failing to decipher Marx's handwriting, he put 'Kranz?' in square brackets af­
ter the addressee's name, Kraus. Also in square brackets and with a question mark 
is the word 'proceeded'. The copy contains further notes made by the same per­
son.— 6

Friedrich Engels,  Correspondence.  1846-1895. A Selection with Commentary and 
Notes,  Martin Lawrence Ltd., London [1934].—7, 60, 320, 349, 394, 403, 410, 
412, 445 
8 A reference to the  German  Workers' Educational  Society  in London, which was found­
ed in February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other leaders of the 
League of the Just. In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx and Engels took an active part in the 
Society's work, but on 17 September 1850 they and a number of their followers 
withdrew from it because the Willich-Schapper sectarian and adventurist faction 
had temporarily increased its influence in the Society. The subsequent weakening of 
the sectarians' influence made it possible for Marx and Engels to resume their work 
in the Educational Society late in 1850. When the International Working Men's 
Association was set up, the Society, with Friedrich Lessner as one of its leaders, be­
came the German Section of the International in London. 
This letter deals with the differences of opinion associated with the need to work 
out a new tactics for the German Social-Democrats after the introduction of the 
Anti-Socialist Law in October 1878 (see Note 16).—7, 72, 252, 333, 334, 356 
9 At the Reichstag elections on 30 July 1878, shortly before the promulgation of the 
Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 16), the Social-Democrats won 437,158 votes.— 8 
10 Despite the Anti-Socialist Law, most of the primary organisations continued 
to function, using every available legal opportunity to make known the proletariat's 
feelings and sentiments (e.g., a meeting held at the funeral of Wilhelm Bracke, one 
of the party leaders). The obstacles put up by the authorities, failed to stop 
the socialists from carrying out a major campaign to collect funds for the per­
sons deported from Berlin, renewing the contacts lost in the initial confusion, and 
setting up illegal organisations.— 9 
11 On behalf of the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 8), 
H. Meyer invited Engels to its meeting of 27 March 1880, which was to discuss the 
Society's reorganisation.— 9 
12 The real date of the letter, erroneously indicated by Bebel as 27 March 1880 in his 
letter to Engels of 22 September 1880, has been ascertained by the event mentioned 
in it, the Hamburg Reichstag elections on 27 April. In the second Russian edition of 
Marx's and Engels' Works and in Werke, the letter is dated early May 1880.— 10 
13 In March-May 1880, the Reichstag debated the extension of the Anti-Socialist Law 
(see Note 16) until 1886. At the third reading of the Bill on 4 May, an ultra-
'revolutionary' speech was made by the Social-Democratic deputy and former Las-
sallean Wilhelm Hasselmann, who sided with the Russian terrorists and the French 
anarchists and openly opposed the Social-Democrats' line. Der Sozialdemokrat  (No.

20, 16 May 1880) declared that Hasselmann had placed himself outside the party. 
By Bebel's 'speech on the persecutions', Engels means the latter's speech in the 
Reichstag on 6 March, which was carried, in a slightly abridged form, by Der So­
zialdemokrat, No. 11, 14 March 1880, under the heading 'Polizei-Orgien in Berlin 
unter dem Belagerungszustand'. — 10 
14 Engels is referring to the victory of the Social-Democratic candidate Georg Wil­
helm Hartmann at the Reichstag elections in Hamburg on 27 April 1880. He 
obtained 13,155 votes out of the 23,231 cast.— 11 
15 The National Liberals (die Nationalliberale Partei) was the party of the German, 
mostly Prussian, bourgeoisie, which emerged in the autumn of 1866 as a result of 
the split in the Party of Progress (see Note 256). The policy of National Liberals 
showed that a considerable section of the liberal bourgeoisie renounced claims to 
broader political rights and capitulated before Bismarck's Junker government. Af­
ter the unification of Germany, the National Liberal Party acquired its final shape 
as a party of the big bourgeoisie, notably the industrial tycoons.— 11 
16 The Exceptional Law against the Socialists (Gesetz gegen die gemeingefährlichen 
Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie —the Law against the Harmful and Dan­
gerous Aspirations of Social-Democracy) was introduced by the Bismarck govern­
ment, supported by the majority in the Reichstag, on 21 October 1878 to counter 
the socialist and workers' movement. Better known as the Anti-Socialist Law, it 
made the Social-Democratic Party of Germany illegal, banned all party and mass 
workers' organisations and suppressed the socialist and workers' press. Socialist liter­
ature was confiscated and the Social-Democrats subjected to reprisals. However, 
during its operation, the Social-Democratic Party assisted by Marx and Engels up­
rooted both opportunist and 'ultra-Left' elements and substantially strengthened its 
influence among the people. Under pressure from the mass workers' movement, the 
Anti-Socialist Law was abrogated on 1 October 1890. For Engels' assessment of the 
Law, see his article 'Bismarck and the German Working Men's Party' (present edi­
tion, Vol. 24, pp. 407-09).—11, 38, 40, 50, 127, 152, 153', 192, 209, 279, 281, 332, 
349, 390, 395, 414, 430, 448 
17 The British general elections, held between late March and mid-April 1880, pro­
duced a victory for the Liberals. They obtained 349 seats in the new Parliament as 
against 243 received by the Conservatives. Leadership of the Cabinet was assumed 
by Gladstone, who opposed the policy of rapprochement with Germany.— 11 
18 Engels is referring to the events of the Danish War of 1864, in which Prussia and 
Austria were allies. After their victory over Denmark, Austria established its gov­
ernment in Holstein, and Prussia in Schleswig. But as a result of its defeat in the 
Austro-Prussian War which Bismarck unleashed in 1866 and the establishment of 
the North German Confederation, Austria lost all rights to Holstein, and Schleswig-
Holstein became a Prussian province.—12

phlet at Lafargue's request, having rewritten three chapters of Anti-Diihring (Chap­
ter I of the Introduction and chapters I and II of Part III) to form a popular work 
in its own right. It was first printed by the French socialist magazine La Revue so­
cialiste, Nos. 3, 4 and 5, 1880, and then published, also in 1880, as a pamphlet. The 
French socialist Benoît Malon embarked on an introduction to it, but his effort was 
deemed unacceptable, and the introduction as it appeared was written by Marx, 
who had first consulted Engels (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 335-39). In the 
pamphlet, the introduction carried the signature of Lafargue, whom Marx request­
ed to 'polish the phrases, leaving the gist intact' (see this volume, p. 16).— 12, 332, 
352, 369 
21 Lassalle was Countess Sophie von Hatzfeldt's lawyer in her divorce case in 1846-
54.—  15

Lassalle in the publication of a newspaper, see present edition, Vol. 41, pp. 252, 261 
and 281-82.—15 
23 Marx wrote this on the last page of his introduction to the French edition of Engels' 
pamphlet (see Note 20).—15

Frederick Engels, Letters on 'Capital', New Park Publications, London, 1983.—16, 
203, 432, 435 
25 In a letter of 19 June 1880, the Dutch socialist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis re­
quested Marx to look through a popular outline of Volume One of  Capital  he had 
written in Dutch. Nieuwenhuis' work, entitled Karl Marx. Kapilaal en  Arbeid,  ap­
peared in The Hague in  1881.—  16 
26 The book review column of the Jahrbuch für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik 
(Erster Jahrgang. Zweite Hälfte, Zürich-Oberstrass, 1880) featured two reviews by 
Nieuwenhuis, one of Eduard von Hartmann's Die  Phänomenologie  des sittlichen Be-
wusstseins (Berlin, 1879), and the other, of Dr J. A. Levy's Engelsch Katheder-
socialisme (Belinfanto, s' Gravenhage, 1879).—16 
27 The reference is to one of the notes to Chapter V of Volume One of Capital (see 
present edition, Vol. 35). In it, Marx replaced the term 'price of production' 
with its synonym, 'average price'.—16 
28 As Marx's principal economic work advanced, the plan and structure of  Capital  re­
peatedly changed. As of 1867, when Volume One appeared in print, Marx pro­
posed to publish the work in three volumes of four books, with the second and third 
books making up the second volume (see present edition, Vol. 35). After Marx's 
death, Engels prepared for the press and published the manuscripts of the second 
and third books as volumes Two and Three. He died before he was able to publish 
the fourth and last book, Theories of  Surplus  Value (Volume Four of Capital).— 16 
29 The reference is to Minna Gorbunova's letter to Engels written in the first half of 
July 1880. She said she wanted to use in Russia the already available experience, 
and asked Engels to recommend her books on vocational training in England.— 17 
30 Between mid-August and 18 September 1880, Engels was on holiday in Ramsgate 
and Bridlington Quay.— 17, 23, 34, 35, 39 
31 The reference is to the World Exhibition of 1878 in Paris.— 17

33 The London-based book trading firm of Philip Stephen King specialised in the sale 
of government and parliamentary publications, statistical material, etc. Marx used 
its services between 1867 and 1882. He probably needed the book ordered in this 
letter for his work on Volume Two of Capital.—19, 367 
34 This letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx and Frederick 
Engels, Selected  Correspondence,  Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow,

35 In her letter to Engels of 25 July 1880, Minna Gorbunova mentioned the Acts of 
Parliament on primary education of 1870, 1873 and 1876, as well as the  Report  of the 
Committee of  the Council on Education  1878-1879.—  20 
36 In her letter of 25 July 1880, Gorbunova wrote that she was shortly to return to 
Moscow and gave Engels her address: Toporov's House, Bolshaya Molchanovka 
St., Moscow.— 20

an attempt to adapt the Russian autocratic system to the needs of capitalist de­
velopment.—  20, 175 
38 Marx and his family were on holiday in Ramsgate from early August to 13 Septem­
ber 1880.—21,  24, 35, 46, 60 
39 Gorbunova asked Engels for advice concerning vocational training in Russia. She 
asked him, in particular, about the ways 'to avoid, while promoting vocational 
training in those industrial branches that are most adapted to big production, 
the advancement of factory production with its workers totally alienated from the 
land'.—21 
40 Obshchina (Commune) — a pre-capitalist spontaneously evolved social group of 
agricultural producers, who own or control their means of production.— 22

joint economic activity (carpentry, fishing, masonry, wood-cutting, agriculture, 
etc.).—22 
42 The Editors are not in possession of John Swinton's letter to which Marx is reply­
ing.—22 
43 Marx met John Swinton, then responsible editor of the New York Sun, in Ramsgate 
in August 1880. Swinton published an account of the interview Marx granted him 
in The Sun on 6 September 1880 (see Vol. 24, pp. 583-85), and in the collection Cur­
rent Views and Notes of Forty Days in  France  and England, New York, 1880.—  23, 40, 77

45 On 18 March 1876, the German socialist Ferdinand Lingenau, who had emigrated 
to the United States, bequeathed about S 7,000, half of his fortune, to the Socialist 
Workers' Party of Germany. He appointed August Bebcl, Johann Philipp Becker, 
Wilhelm Bracke, August Geib, Wilhelm Liebknecht and Karl Marx his executors. 
After Lingenau's death on 4 August 1877 in St Louis (Missouri) they tried to have

the money bequeathed to the party transferred to its funds, and gave Sorge power of 
attorney. Sorge wrote to Marx on 13 August 1880 that he would have to drop the 
matter if he did not get hold of some money to continue with it. Bismarck ultimately 
managed to prevent Lingenau's legacy being credited to the Social-Democratic 
Party's funds.—24, 99 
46 The reference is to the suspension, in August 1880, owing to the shortage of funds, 
of the publication of the French newspaper L'Egalité, to which Paul Lafargue 
had been contributing.—  24, 27 
47 The reference is to the piece on Marx's activities and works written by Hazeltine, 
a staff member on The Sun.— 24

their living (see this volume, pp. 27-29).— 26

53 Part of this letter was quoted by Nikolai Danielson in the preface to the first Russian 
edition of Volume Two of Capital, St Petersburg, 1885.— 30 
54 The address on the envelope containing this letter was written in Eleanor Marx's 
hand: N. Danielson. Société du Crédit mutuel, Pont de Kazan, maison Lessnikoff, 
St Petersburg, Russia.— 30 
55 On 21 August (2 September) 1880, Danielson requested Marx to write an article on 
Russia's post-reform economy for a Russian magazine.— 30 
56 This refers to the article 'OnepKn Haiuero nope<J>opMeHHaro o6ujecTBenHaro 
xo3HHCTBa' ('Sketches of Our Post-Reform Social Economy') Danielson published 
in the Slovo in October 1880 under the pen-name Nikolai —on.—  31, 61 
57 A reference to the world economic crisis which began in 1873 and particularly affect­
ed the United States and Germany. In the late 1870s, it spread to Britain.— 31

6 ' This is a reply to an undated letter of Dr Ferdinand Fleckles who had enclosed 
a medical form to be filled in by Jenny Marx. Marx wrote it on the front of the 
form. Jenny's description of her illness is on the back.— 36 
62 The letter to Eugen Oswald is in German, and that to the unknown correspondent, 
in English. The latter is the response to Kaulitz's request for a letter of recommen­
dation for a teaching post.— 36 
63 The French translation of Volume One of Capital was prepared by Joseph Roy. 
Marx made substantial changes in and additions to the manuscript. For this reason, 
he maintained that, like the German original, the French edition had a scientific 
significance of its own. In conformity with the French edition, changes were intro­
duced into the subsequent editions of Capital in German, Russian and other lan­
guages. 
The publication was undertaken by Maurice Lachâtre, a French journalist and 
publisher. The book was printed b"y the Lahure press in Paris. Under the contract 
signed by Marx and Lachâtre, Capital was to come out in instalments, 44 in all, 16 
printed pages each. The work was printed in two instalments at a time, but was sold 
in series of five instalments each, which made nine series in all. Publication was 
begun in September 1872 and completed in November 1875. 
Having received a copy of Capital from Marx, Swinton wrote to him on 7 De­
cember 1880: 'A thousand thanks for the great work Capital which I shall have 
bound handsomely, and keep as a treasure through life.'—40, 42 
64 Marx is probably referring to the outcome of the second Anglo-Afghan War of 
1878-80. The staunch resistence of the Afghans forced Britain to abandon its plans 
to conquer and partition the country, and made it reach a compromise with Khan 
Abdur Rahman. The period also witnessed an aggravation of the situation in Bri­
tish-annexed Transvaal, where a Boer uprising flared up in mid-December 1880.—

6 5 A reference to the so-called local state of siege declared by Bismarck in Berlin and its 
environs on 28 November 1878 on the strength of Para. 28 of the Anti-Socialist Law 
(see Note 16) and extended to Hamburg, its environs and the adjacent Prussian ter­
ritories (see also Note 198) on 29 October 1880. Under it, meetings could be held 
only with police permission, distribution of printed matter in public places was pro­
hibited, persons considered politically unreliable were deported, and the right to 
own, carry, import and pass on arms was withdrawn or restricted.—  41, 43, 152

67 The Alliance of Socialist Democracy was founded by Mikhail Bakunin in 
Geneva in October 1868 as an international anarchist organisation. In 1869 the 
Alliance approached the General Council of the International Working Men's As­
sociation with a request to be admitted to the International. The General Council 
agreed to admit individual sections of the Alliance provided the latter dissolved as 
an independent organisation. On entering the International, Bakunin did not ac­
tually comply with this decision and incorporated the Alliance into it under the

guise of a section (called 'the Alliance of Socialist Democracy. Central Section'). 
Marx, Engels and the General Council fought the Alliance, exposing it as a sect 
hostile to the working-class movement (for details, see present edition, Vol. 23). 
The Hague Congress of the International (1872) dealt a severe blow at the anar­
chists and expelled the Alliance's leaders Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume 
from the International.—43, 181, 190, 333, 341, 370, 408 
68 A reference to the Programme électoral des travailleurs socialistes, the 
preamble to which was dictated by Marx to Jules Guesde (see present edition, 
Vol. 24, p. 340). The theoretical part was followed by a minimum programme in­
corporating an economic and a political section. The election programme was 
widely discussed at workers' meetings and adopted as the official programme of the 
French Workers' Party (see Note 195) at its national congress in Le Havre in No­
vember 1880.—43, 148, 342, 386, 447, 474

group, a revolutionary Narodnik (Populist) organisation formed in August 1879, 
when the secret revolutionary society Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) split into 
Narodnaya Volya and Chorny Peredel (the Black or General Redistribution). The 
founders of the Narodnaya Volya were professional revolutionaries, advocates of 
a political campaign against the autocracy.— 44, 83

76 The controversy between the General Council and the bourgeois radical Charles 
Bradlaugh arose after the latter's attacks on Marx in a public lecture in London on 
11 December 1871, and in his letter to The Eastern Post (16 December). At the 
General Council meeting of 19 December, Marx drew attention to the close connec­
tion between Bradlaugh's statements and the campaign of persecution unleashed 
against the International by the ruling quarters and the bourgeois press, which be­
came especially fierce after the International issued the address 'The Civil War in 
France' in June 1871. Marx replied to Bradlaugh in a series of statements featured 
by The Eastern Post (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 71-73).— 52

77 Bradlaugh nominated himself as a candidate at the elections, contributed to the 
press under the pen-name Iconoclast and hoped to be elected to the House of Com­
mons in 1874 (St Stephen's in Westminster had been the seat of the House of Com­
mons since 1547).— 53

80 In his letter of 4 December 1880, Kautsky asked Engels to comment on his book 
Der Einfluss der Volksvermehrung auf den Fortschritt der Gesellschaft, Vien­
na, 1880. He sent a copy to Engels in December 1880 through Bernstein. Kaut­
sky wrote that he was coming to London for a few months in order to meet 
Engels and Marx personally. He arrived in London in March 1881 and met 
Engels on several occasions.— 56

peared in Leipzig in 1878 (see present edition, Vol. 25, pp. 196-97).— 56 
82 Armchair socialists  {Kathedersozialisten)  — followers of a trend in bourgeois 
socialism that emerged in Germany in the 1860s-70s. In 1873, its champions (Gus­
tav Schmoller, Adolph Wagner and Lujo Brentano) set up a society called Verein 
für Sozialpolitik which had its own printed organ, Schriften des  Vereins  für So­
zialpolitik. Armchair socialists supported Bismarck's social policy, advocated 
class harmony and opposed the workers' revolutionary action.—  56, 65, 416, 449, 
453 
83 By 1881, A. E. F. Schäffle had the following works printed: Das gesellschaftliche 
System der menschlichen Wirtschaft, Tübingen, 1873, in two volumes; Die 
Quintessenz des Socialismus, Gotha, 1875; Bau und Leben des socialen Körpers, 
Tübingen, 1875-78, in four volumes; Enzyklopädie der Staatslehre, Tübin­

to which the doubling of the Earth's population may theoretically occur in less than 
12 years.— 57

86 On Engels' advice, this poem by Georg Weerth was reprinted by Der Sozialde­
mokrat on 11 August 1881. The title, 'Ein Sozialistenfresser aus dem Jahre 1848', 
was to mirror that of Ludwig Börne's well-known lampoon 'Menzel der Franzosen­
fresser', Paris, 1837.—59 
87 Engels is referring to the first of the two essays entitled 'Die zehn Gebote' carried by 
Der Sozialdemokrat, No. 5, 30 January 1881, which exposed the Prussian kings' 
policy of robbing the people, and to Eduard Bernstein's article 'Ein Gedenktag', 
printed under the pen-name Leo in Der Sozialdemokrat, No. 4, 23 January 
1881,  on the 88th anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI.— 59

cialist ideas, and asked Marx to entrust him with the translation of Volume One of 
Capital. 
The meeting scheduled for 17 February did not take place. The day before, 
Pearson let Marx know that the appointed time was inconvenient for him. 
There is another letter from Pearson to Marx, dated 11 April 1881, from which 
it emerges that Marx and Pearson failed to reach an agreement concerning the 
translation. 
Volume One of Capital was translated into English by Samuel Moore and 
Edward Aveling and appeared in print in 1887.— 60 
89 A reference to the publications of official documents by the governments of various 
countries, which Marx called the Blue Books after the publications of the British 
Parliament.—61,  471, 472 
90 Marx is referring to the manuscript of Paul Lafargue's essay the Russian translation 
of which '/JßHaceHie no3eMeAi>HOH  COÔCTBCHHOCTH BO OpaHmV ('The Movement of 
Land Property in France') was published in the monthly Ustoi (Principles), 
Nos. 3-4 and 6, 1882.— 61 
91 Marx is referring to the promise of the  CJIOSO  (Slovo) editors 'to return to the 
subject of the article' (on Danielson's article, see Note 56) 'in one of the magazine's 
later issues' (Cjioeo, October 1880, p. 142, editorial note). However, Danielson's 
article was never mentioned again.— 62 
92 Degeneration. A Chapter in Darwinism (London, 1880), a work by Edwin 
Ray Lankester, appeared in Russian translation in St Petersburg in 1883 under the

93 A copy of Janson's book was sent to Marx by Danielson, as is clear from his letter of 
24 February (8 March) 1881. 
The notebooks with excerpts and synopses from Russian books and other 
sources on Russia filled in by Marx in January-February and May-June 1881

lished anonymously, tried to discredit Marx as a scholar by accusing him of scient­
ific incompetence and deliberate misquotation of the sources he used. When on 
1 June 1872 Der Volksstaat carried Marx's reply (see present edition, Vol. 23, 
pp. 164-67),  Concordia  (No. 27, 4 July) responded with another article by Bren­
tano (also anonymous) to which Marx replied in Der Volksstaat, No. 63, 7 Au­
gust 1872 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 190-97). After Marx's death, the cam­
paign of slander launched by Brentano was taken up by the British bourgeois econ­
omist Sedley Taylor, who was exposed by Engels in June 1890 in the preface to the 
fourth German edition of Volume One of  Capital  and in 1891 in the pamphlet 'In 
the Case of Brentano versus Marx' (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 95-176). In the 
section of the pamphlet called 'Documents' Engels reproduced both of Marx's let­
ters to Der Volksstaat.— 65 
100 Tnis refers to the International Socialist Congress to be convened in Switzerland 
on the initiative of Belgian socialists to discuss the establishment of a new Interna­
tional. The congress took place not in Zurich (the Zurich cantonal council forbade 
it), but in Chur between 2 and 4 October 1881. It was attended by delegates of  so­
cialist parties from 12 countries. The congress decided against forming a new 
International. 
In his letter to Marx of 6 January 1881 Nieuwenhuis expressed the intention of 
the Dutch Social Democrats to discuss at the congress the laws to be passed imme­
diately in the political and economic fields by the socialists should they come to 
power.— 66

102 Albert Regnard, a French writer and historian, wrote to Marx's daughter Jenny 
Longuet in connection with his articles on Irish history (they have not been found) 
because her contributions on Ireland to the French newspaper La Marseil­
laise in 1870 (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 414-41) had found recognition 
among the readers.— 67 
103 Scotch Covenanters  — the signers and adherents of the National Covenant, a religious 
and political alliance proclaimed in Scotland in 1638 after the successful uprising 
of 1637 against Charles I's absolutist government. Rallying round the banner of 
the Presbyterian (Calvinist) Church against 'Popedom', the signatories of the 
Covenant fought for Scotland's national autonomy. The Covenanters' war against 
Charles I brought forward the outbreak of the bourgeois revolution in England.—

Charles I and became the constituent body of the English Revolution.— 69 
107 The Penal Laws (or  Code)  were introduced by the English colonialists in Ireland in 
the late 17th and the first half of the 18th century under the pretext of a need to 
combat Catholic conspiracies and the enemies of the Anglican Church. To all 
practical purposes, the laws deprived the Irish, who were mostly Catholic, of all 
political and civil rights: restricted the right of inheritance, and of acquisition and 
alienation of property; introduced the practice of confiscating property; estab­
lished onerous terms of lease for Catholic peasants, which aggravated their 
bondage to English landlords and land agents; banned Irish national 
schools; imposed harsh penalties on teachers, Irish Catholic priests, etc. It was not 
until the late 18th century that the growing national liberation movement in Ire­
land forced the authorities to abrogate a significant part of the penal laws.— 69 
io8 A reference to the subsidies granted to the Irish Catholic College opened in the 
town of Maynooth in 1795. Pitt's government tried to use the foundation of the 
College to win over the Catholic clergy and the leading stratum of the Irish bour­
geoisie in order to split the Irish national movement.— 69 
109 The Anglo-Irish Union came into force on  1 January 1801 and deprived Ireland of 
the last remnants of parliamentary autonomy (the Irish Parliament was disbanded 
and Irish M.P.s received a number of seats in the British Parliament, where they 
were in the minority).— 69, 286 
110 The system of national  schools  — a reference to the school reform of 1831 intro­

subjects were taught separately.— 70

117 The Overseas Trade Society {Seehandlung) —a merchant and credit company 
founded in Prussia in 1772. It enjoyed a number of major state privileges and 
granted large loans to the government, acting, in fact, as its banker and broker. In 
1904,  it was officially transformed into the Prussian State Bank.— 74 
1 '8 An allusion to the indecision displayed in tactical issues by the Social-Democratic 
leaders in Germany after the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 16). 
Their wavering was reflected in Liebknecht's speech in the Reichstag on 17 March 
1879 on the introduction of the so-called local state of siege in Berlin and its envi­
rons (see Note 65), and that in the Saxon Landtag on 17 February 1880 on the 
elections in Chemnitz's No. 1 constituency. Liebknecht stated in the Reichstag that 
the Social-Democratic Party would abide by the Anti-Socialist Law, being a party 
of reform in the proper sense of the word, and opposed a 'violent' revolution as 
nonsense. In the Provincial Diet, he said that since the Social-Democratic Party of 
Germany was taking part in the elections to the legislative bodies, it was not 
a party advocating the overthrow of the government.—  75, 203 
119 In February-March 1881, by decision of the Wyden Congress (see Note 418) of the 
Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche and Louis Vie­
reck visited the United States. Engels, who disapproved of the trip, wrote: '...this 
much is certain — no amount of American money will make good the damage that 
will infallibly be done if, after the manner of Fritzsche and Viereck, the emissaries 
again water down the party's viewpoint into a semblance of vulgar democracy and 
homespun philistinism' (see present edition, Vol. 47, letter to August Bebel of 18 
January 1884).—75, 99, 447 
120 An attempt on William I's life was made on 2 June 1878 by the German anarchist 
Karl Eduard Nobiling, who fired from a sporting rifle loaded with small shot. This 
attempted assassination, as well as that by apprentice E. M. Hödel on 11 May 
1878,  served as a convenient excuse for Bismarck to demand that the Reichs­
tag pass the Exceptional Law against the Socialists (see Note 16).—  75, 175, 209, 
288, 448 
121 In December 1880, the British Prime Minister Gladstone declared that he intend­
ed to submit to Parliament a new bill on the state of emergency in Ireland (see 
Note 123). This prompted the Left wing of the Irish Land League (see Note 139) 
to urge the peasants to refuse payment of land rent. The more resolute section of 
the revolutionary democrats believed this would be a prologue to a long-expected 
armed uprising.— 75 
122 This may refer to the resolution passed by the House of Commons on 3 February 
1881 introducing a new procedure in the British Parliament. Seeking to combat 
the obstructionist tactics of the Irish opposition in the House of Commons, which 
made it impossible to get a coercion bill for Ireland (see Note 123) passed by Par­
liament, Gladstone proposed a resolution granting the Speaker the right to inter­
rupt any M.P. at any point and to expel him from the House.—  75, 84 
'2 3 The  Coercion  Bills were passed by the British Parliament several times through­
out the 19th century in order to suppress the revolutionary and national libera­
tion movement in Ireland. In early 1881, the House of Commons passed two bills 
introducing exceptional laws in Ireland. They declared a state of emergency there 
and assigned troops to evict tenants refusing to pay rent.— 75, 84, 172

124 The Irish Land Bill was debated in Parliament from late 1880, but did not become 
law until 22 August 1881 (an Act to further amend the law relating to the occu­
pation and ownership of land in Ireland and for other purposes relating thereto). 
The new Act somewhat restricted the high-handed practices of the English land­
lords with respect to their tenant farmers. Landlords lost the right to evict tenants 
provided the latter paid the rent on time, and the amount of rent payable was 
fixed for 15 years. Although the Land Bill gave the landlords a chance to sell land to 
the state at a profit, and the fixed rent remained very high, the English landlords 
opposed the Bill, seeking to maintain their undivided rule.— 75, 84, 86 
125 Engels is replying to Johann Philipp Becker's letter of 24 March 1881 in which the 
latter thanked him for the help he had received in October 1880.— 76 
126 The reference is to a meeting in the United States at the time of Fritzsche's and 
Viereck's stay there (see Note 119). 
A report on the meeting held in Boston on 6 March 1881 was printed by Der 
Sozialdemokrat, Nos. 13 and 16, 27 March and 17 April  1881.—  77 
127 German democratic emigrants, including members of the German gymnastic 
clubs,  took an active part in the American Civil War of 1861-65 on the side of the 
North. In 1861, German emigrants residing not far from St Louis joined the North­
erners' detachments and prevented Governor D. Jackson from handing the town 
over to the South. 
German gymnastic  clubs  — organisations of German democratic emigrants, in­
cluding workers, set up in the USA by participants in the 1848-49 revolution. At 
a congress in Philadelphia on 5 October 1850, the gymnastic clubs joined together 
to form a Socialist Gymnastic Association (Sozialistischer Turnverein), which 
maintained contacts with German workers' organisations in America.— 77

135 In 1874, Henri Rochefort, a French journalist, writer and politician exiled from 
France after the defeat of the Paris Commune, found himself in Geneva, where he 
contacted Russian political refugees. The Executive Committee of the Narodnaya 
Volya (see Note 70) sent him a letter requesting him to assist the Committee's 
agent Lev Hartmann in organising a propaganda campaign against the tsarist gov­
ernment. Judging by Marx's letter, it was this letter that Rochefort reprinted in his 
newspaper (the Institute of Marxism-Leninism does not have the copy of Intransi­
geant at its disposal). The publication caused Russian refugees in Geneva to voice 
their protest at an open meeting. The statement that they were breaking off all 
contacts with Rochefort appeared in Die Freiheit on 26 March  1881.—  82

March 1881, was held on 26-29 March (7-10 April) 1881. All of them, except  Gelf­
man, were sentenced on 29 March to death by hanging and executed on 3 (15) 
April. In Gelfman's case, on account of her pregnancy the sentence was commuted 
to penal labour for life; she died in prison on 1 February 1882.— 83 
137 Over 3,000 people perished and more than 1,000 were injured in the earthquake

tionary democrat Michael Davitt. It embraced mostly peasants and urban 
poor and enjoyed the support of the progressive elements of the Irish bourgeoisie. 
The League's agrarian programme expressed the spontaneous protest of the Irish 
people against the landlords' rule and national oppression. However, some of its 
leaders attempted to reduce its activities to the campaign for Home Rule, that is, 
limited autonomy of Ireland within the framework of the British Empire, and did 
not go so far as to demand the abolition of the English landlords' rule. In 1881, the 
Land League was banned by the British government but, to all practical purposes, 
continued to exist up to the late 1880s.— 84, 286

144 The reference is to the  Stenographische Berichte über  die Verhandlungen des  Reichstags.  4. 
Legislaturperiode. IV. Session 1881, Vol. I, Berlin, 1881 (see Note 141). The 
Workers' Accident Insurance Bill was part of Bismarck's so-called labour legisla­
tion. It provided for the establishment of an Imperial Accident Insurance Bank. 
Two-thirds of the insurance expenses were to be incurred by the employers, and 
one-third, by the workers; those who earned 750 marks a year or less were to have 
their contributions paid by the Treasury. Bebel subjected the Bill to well-
substantiated and sharp criticism and demanded that the workers' accident insur­
ance be wholly financed by the employers. The Bill was passed by the Reichstag on 
27 June 1884. Bebel's speeches were also printed by Der Sozialdemokrat,  Nos. 16-

government responsible for the difficult position of the Irish people, demanded 
that the eviction of tenants who had failed to pay their rent be stopped, the arrest­
ed leaders of the Land League (see Note 139) be released, and that the Secretary 
of State for Ireland William Forster, who ruthlessly suppressed the national libera-

tion movement there, resign. A long speech at the meeting was made by Charles 
Stewart Parnell, who censured Forster's activities in Ireland.— 95 
153 This rumour was based on an episode in the Narodnaya Volya organisation's fight 
against the autocracy. 
Sofia Perovskaya and Lev Hartmann, posing as husband and wife, took a flat in 
the house from which a tunnel was dug to the Moscow-Kursk railway line as part 
of a plan to blow up the tsar's train. The attempt, undertaken on 19 November 
1879,  was abortive. Perovskaya also helped with the preparations for the assassina­
tion of Alexander II, which was carried out on 1 March 1881, and was arrested 
shortly afterwards. 
On Perovskaya's execution, see Note 136.— 96

156 Anti-Renters — in the 1830s and 1840s, land tenants in the State of New York who 
refused to pay rent to the big landowners and demanded that the farms be sold to 
them. The Anti-Renters offered armed resistance to the rent collectors. The greatest 
unrest took place between 1839 and 1845. The campaign against the landowners 
ended in a compromise: from 1846, they graduallv began to sell land to tenants.—

157 Marx is probably referring to Henry George's article 'The Kearney Agitation in 
California' carried by The Popular  Science  Monthly in August 1880. Marx wrote 
out excerpts from it, which are still extant. 
The Editors are not in possession of a copy of the Atlantic Monthly.—101 
158 The reference is to the Democratic Federation, an English socialist association set 
up in June 1881 and headed by Henry Mayers Hyndman. Its programme closely 
resembled that of the Chartists (see Note 159). 
At the inaugural conference of the Democratic Federation, each participant 
received a copy of Hyndman's pamphlet England for All in which (Chapter 
II — 'Labour' and Chapter III — 'Capital') the author presented whole sections of 
Volume One of Capital as the programme of the Federation, distorting many of 
Marx's ideas and making no reference to either the work or its author. 
In 1884, the Democratic Federation was transformed into the Social 
Democratic Federation.—102, 162, 251 
159 Chartism  — a political movement of British workers in the 1830s-50s advocating the 
People's Charter, which contained the demand for universal suffrage and specified 
the terms that would guarantee this right to the workers. Arising from the conse­
quences of the industrial revolution, Chartism was a revolutionary form of work­
ers' protest against capitalist exploitation, their lack of political rights and the 
landlords' and big bourgeoisie's monopoly of power. The Chartist movement was 
a major stage in the working-class struggle at the time preceding the emergence of 
Marxism.—102, 293 
160 Between late June and around 20 July 1881, Marx and his ailing wife rested 
in Eastbourne.—104, 110, 185

163 In May-August 1881 Engels contributed to the printed organ of the British trade 
unions The Labour  Standard,  which appeared in London and was edited by George 
Shipton. Engels's contributions were printed anonymously nearly every week as 
leaders (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 376-418). All in all, Engels wrote 11 arti­
cles. The last one, 'Social Classes — Necessary and Superfluous', appeared in The 
Labour Standard on 6 August 1881, after which Engels terminated his work for the 
paper due to the mounting opportunist tendencies among its editors.— 105, 119,

original) drawing a parallel wlith the Kulturkampf policy pursued by the Bismarck 
government in the 1870s. To suppress the clergy and weaken the Party of the Cen­
tre (see Note 225), laws were introduced that banned political agitation by clergy­
men, withdrew their right of supervision over the schools, etc. Bismarck's cam­
paign was a failure. In the late 1870s-early 1880s, seeking to unite the forces of re­
action, Bismarck effected a reconciliation with the Catholic clergy. Nearly all the 
laws passed against it at the time of the Kulturkampf were abrogated (see also Note 
255).—117 
173 The  Labour  Standard,  No. 14, 6 August 1881, anonymously printed the article by  Jo­
hann Georg Eccarius 'A German Opinion of English Trade Unionism'. Eccarius 
regarded highly the German trade unions founded in 1868 by Max Hirsch and 
Franz Duncker (the so-called Hirsch-Duncker trade unions). For Engels' opinion 
of the article, see this volume, p. 119.—118, 121, 123

176 The Manchester  School  — a trend in economic thinking which reflected the interests 
of the industrial bourgeoisie. Its supporters, known as Free Traders (the centre of 
their agitation was Manchester), advocated free trade and non-interference by 
the government in the economy. In the 1840s and 1850s, the Free Traders formed 
a separate political group, which later constituted the Left wing of the 
Liberal Party.—122, 260 
'7 7 Factories  and workshops'  acts  — laws regulating labour conditions in British industry. 
The emergence and advancement of factory legislation was a consequence of the 
workers' economic and political struggle against capitalist exploitation. The first 
laws adopted regulated the children's, adolescents', and women's labour con­
ditions in the textile industry (early 19th century). Step by step, the operation of 
the factories and workshops' acts was extended to the other industries.— 122, 140

183 Below, Engels quotes Hirsch's letter to him of 11 August  1881.—  126 
184 Engels is referring to two of Bernstein's articles with the same title, 'Es fehlt uns an 
Intelligenzen', published under the pen-name Leo in Der Sozialdemokrat, Nos. 31 
and 33, 28 July and 11 August 1881.—127, 137 
185 On 11 August 1881, Der Sozialdemokrat (the 'Sozialpolitische Rundschau' col­
umn) referred to Jules Vallès as a 'brave and highly esteemed member of the Com­
mune'. The editors mentioned Vallès' letter printed by Le Citoyen de  Paris, in which 
he refused to stand for election to the French Chamber of Deputies (to which he 
had been nominated by two Paris districts), saying that he preferred to enter par­
liament not through the door but on the shoulders of the insurgent people.— 127 
186 Jules Vallès' open letter to the President of the French Republic Grcvy was pub­
lished in early February 1879 in the newspaper La Révolution Française.— 127 
187 The New Madrid  Federation  was formed on 8 July 1872 by the members of  La. Eman­
cipation editorial board expelled by the anarchist majority from the Madrid Fed­
eration after the newspaper had exposed the activities of the secret Alliance in 
Spain. An active part in the organisation and work of the New Madrid Federation 
was taken by Paul Lafargue. The new Madrid Federation fought against the 
spread of anarchism in Spain, popularised the ideas of scientific socialism, and 
campaigned for the foundation of an independent proletarian party there. Its print­
ed organ, La Emancipacion, had Engels as one of the contributors.—128 
188 A reference to the International Anarchist Congress, which took place in London 
on 14-19 July 1881. Engels' report of the congress was quoted verbatim by Bern­
stein in the 'Sozialpolitische Rundschau' column of Der Sozialdemokrat,  No. 35, 25 
August 1881.—128 
189 The speakers at the Anarchist Congress used numbers rather than names (see re­
ports on the congress printed by Die  Freiheit,  Nos. 31, 32 and 33, 30 July, 6 and 13 
August 1881). The Freiheit report of 23 July stated that 45 delegates holding 80 
mandates represented 59 federations and 320 sections.— 129 
190 Der Sozialdemokrat of 25 August 1881 carried this information almost verbatim in 
the 'Sozialpolitische Rundschau' column.— 129 
191 The reference is to the Anarchist Congress in Saint-Imier (Switzerland) convened 
after the Hague Congress of the First International had expelled Mikhail Bakunin 
and James Guillaume. — 129 
192 Engels is probably referring to his study of Marx's manuscript on the history of  dif­
ferential calculus, on which Marx worked in 1878-82. Marx did his first research in 
mathematics back in the 1860s. The extant manuscripts were published for the 
first time in: K. Marx,  Matematicheskiye rukopisi  (Mathematical Manuscripts), Mos­
cow, 1968. They will be included in full in MEGA  1/28.—130

19 5 Collectivists  in the French socialist movement of the 1870s-80s were the followers 
of Marxism who advocated collectivisation of the means of production and work­
ers' involvement in the political struggle. Their leaders were Jules Guesde and 
Paul Lafargue (hence Guesdists, another and more common name for the French 
Marxists). Right from its formation in 1879, the Workers' Party was torn apart by 
fierce ideological dissent, which in 1882 led to its split (see Note 394). 
On the party programme, see Note 68.—134 
196 Marx added these lines to his wife's letter to their daughter Jenny Longuet of 20 
August 1881 (see this volume, pp. 475).—136 
197 August Bebel's letter to Engels of 13 May 1881 has not been found. Engels may be 
referring to Bebel's letter of 13 June 1881, written in reply to Engels' letter of 28 
April.— 137 
198 After a 'local state of siege' (see Note 65) was introduced in Leipzig in June 1881, 
many active socialists, Bebel and Liebknecht among them, were deported from the 
city. On  2 July 1881, they left Leipzig and settled down in Borsdorf close by.— 137,

200 Qn 4 April 1881, August Bebel criticised in the Reichstag the Workers' Accident 
Insurance Bill (see also notes 141 and 144).—138 
20 ' Engels is referring to Liebknecht's speech in the Reichstag on 31 May 1881 on the 
Workers' Accident Insurance Bill (see Note 144): 'The historical process of evolu­
tion is infinitely stronger than the most powerful ruler. Prince Bismarck has himself 
experienced some interesting transformations, he honestly confessed ... that for 
a while he was bringing up the rear of the Free Traders, then of the Protectionist 
movement, and now of socialism' (see  Stenographische  Berichte  über  die Verhandlungen 
des Reichstags. 4. Legislaturperiode. IV. Session 1881, Vol. II, Berlin, 1881, 
p. 1455).—138 
202 A reference to the speech on the Workers' Accident Insurance Bill (see Note 144) 
made by the German Social Democrat Georg Wilhelm Hartmann in the Reichstag 
on 15 June 1881, of which Die Freiheit (No. 26, 25 June 1881) wrote: 'Hartmann 
crawled on his belly before Bismarck and the Reichstag when the Bill was debat­
ed.' Die Freiheit quoted from Hartmann's speech referring to the Frankfurter Lei­
tung; some of the fragments deviate from the text of the official shorthand report 
(see Stenographische  Berichte über die  Verhandlungen  des Reichstags. 4. Legislaturpe­
riode. IV. Session 1881, Vol. II, Berlin, 1881, pp. 1757-59). Judging by the short­
hand report, Hartmann stated that 'the Social Democrats gladly welcome the Bill 
submitted by the Imperial Chancellor' and that 'the main principle' of Social-
Democracy was 'the aspiration to humanity' and 'the moral feeling of assistance to 
those in need'.— 138 
203 The reference is to the results of the elections to the French Chamber of Deputies 
held on 21 August 1881, at which candidates from the French Workers' Party were 
standing for the first time (see Note 208).—138 
204 At the 1877 elections, the German Social-Democrats received about half a million 
votes.—139

206 The Privy Council—a special body under the King of England, first formed in the 
13th century, consisting of secretaries of state and other officials, as well as top 
clergy. For a long time, it had the right to initiate legislation on behalf of the king, 
bypassing Parliament. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Privy Council lost 
a great deal of its power. It retained only the right to accept and consider appeals 
concerning the colonial, ecclesiastical and administrative matters. The Privy 
Council comprises a number of committees, including those on scientific research, 
industry, medicine and agriculture. At present, the Privy Council has virtually no 
say in the administration of the country.— 140 
207 On 22 September 1881, Der Sozialdemokrat carried a leader headed 'Die Vivisek­

208 In October 1880, Malon, Guesde and Brousse started the newspaper L'Emancipa­
tion in Lyons and, on Brousse's suggestion, made a written commitment not to 
stand for election. In November 1880, L'Emancipation ceased to exist, and the edi­
tors' commitment was no longer valid. This enabled Guesde to stand at the elec­
tions of  21 August 1881 to the French Chamber of Deputies from the town of Rou-
baix, for which Malon and Brousse fiercely attacked him.—142, 145, 361

that Lafargue had requested him in early October to hold a collection among his

on the way to treat Lafargue's request, since he felt he was not competent enough 
to correctly appraise the situation in the French working-class movement.— 144

for 10 April 1848. It was to present a petition to Parliament for the adoption of the 
People's Charter. The Government prohibited the demonstration, and troops and 
police were brought to London to prevent it. The Chartist leaders, many of whom 
vacillated, called off the demonstration and persuaded the masses to disperse. The 
failure of the demonstration was used by the Government for an attack on the 
workers and repression of the Chartists.— 152 
219 This refers to Louis Bonaparte's coup d'état on 2 December 1851.—153 
220 On 17 May 1879, with the approval of the whole Social-Democratic group in the 
Reichstag, the Social-Democratic deputy Max Kayser defended the government 
project for protective customs tariffs. Marx and Engels sharply criticised Kayser 
because the proposal promoted the interests of big industrialists and landowners, 
and further condemned some of the German Social-Democratic leaders' stand vis-
à-vis Kayser (see present edition, Vol. 45, pp. 259-62).—153 
221 This refers to August Bebel's letter to Engels of 18 November 1879.—154 
222 The following Social-Democrats won seats in the Reichstag at the elections of 27 
October 1881: Wilhelm Bios, Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz, Karl Frohme, 
Bruno Geiser, Karl Grillenberger, Wilhelm Hasenclever, Max Kayser, Julius 
Kräcker, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Moritz Rittinghausen, Karl Wilhelm Stolle and 
Georg Heinrich von Vollmar. August Bebel was not elected in either of the three 
constituencies where he had been nominated. Neither did he win at the second bal­
lot in the Mainz constituency on 15 December.—154, 188, 259, 454 
223 The Rheims Congress of the French Workers' Party took place between 30 Octo­
ber and 6 November 1881. It was attended by 44 delegates. The Congress en­
dorsed the National Committee (Comité national) of the French Workers' Party, 
set up on Malon's and Brousse's initiative in mid-October 1881 (see Note 250). 
At the Rheims Congress, Malon and Brousse managed to get a decision passed 
recognising that the minimum programme (see Note 68) did 'not quite' live up to 
'the working people's aspirations'. The Congress resolved to leave the programme 
in force until a new one had been adopted. This decision was spearheaded against 
the Marxist groups that united around L'Egalité edited by Jules Guesde. — 154, 
173, 341 
224 At the International Socialist Congress held in Chur (see Note 100), serious differ­
ences surfaced between the Polish socialist groups. Kautsky, who wrote to Engels 
about the matter on 8 November 1881, asked for his opinion concerning the stand 
Der Sozialdemokrat ought to take in this affair. Engels set forth his views in a letter 
to Kautsky of  7 February 1882 (see this volume, pp. 191-95).— 155, 166, 190, 191,

225 The  Centre  (Zentrum) — a political party of German Catholics formed in 1870-71 
as a result of the unification of the Catholic groups in the Prussian Provincial Diet

united, under the banner of Catholicism, the Catholic clergy of various social 
ranks,  landowners, bourgeoisie and certain sections of the peasants, especially in 
the petty and medium-sized states of Western and South-Western Germany, and 
supported their separatist and anti-Prussian tendencies. Engels gave a detailed de­
scription of the Party of the Centre in his work The Role of  Force  in History (see 
present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 509-10).— 157

by the Birmingham Liberal Association on 3 January 1882. John Bright, lead­
er of the British bourgeois radicals and M.P. for Birmingham, and Joseph Cham­
berlain, a public figure in the city, who spoke at the meeting, fully supported the 
Irish policies of Gladstone's Liberal government. Specifically, they vindicated his 
actions aimed at implementing the so-called Land Act of 1881 for Ireland (see 
Note 124).—171 
237 Probably an ironic reference to Jacob Bright, John Bright's younger brother.— 
171 
238 A reference to the meeting held on 3 January 1882. The official pretext for it was

a discussion of the functions of the assistant commissioners, appointed to carry out 
the Land Act of 1881 for Ireland (see Note 124). It was stated at the meeting that 
their decision to introduce a rent reduction was not objective. The landlords de­
manded that the government immediately consider their complaints and promul­
gate the law on compensation for losses they could sustain should the government 
sanction the rent reduction.— 172 
239 Joseph Dietzgen wrote to Marx on 3 January 1882 that he was studying Hegel's 
works, in particular, his  Phänomenologie  des Geistes. — 172 
240 when tne  Reichstag debated the observance of the Anti-Socialist Law in Decem­
ber 1881, deputies Wilhelm Bios and Wilhelm Hasenclever adopted a conciliatory 
stand. In its leader, Der Sozialdemokral,  No. 51,15 December 1881 strongly protest­
ed that the Social-Democratic deputies in the Reichstag 'should neither wail nor 
complain, but brand and expose ... not enter into negotiations, but protest'. The 
protest was supported by the party majority outside the Reichstag and by the So­
cial-Democratic group within it. At a special meeting at which Bebel was also pres­
ent, although he was not a Reichstag deputy at the time, the members of the par­
liamentary group unanimously issued a declaration endorsing the general line of 
Der Sozialdemokral as the party's printed organ. The declaration was printed by 
the newspaper on 16 February 1882. Both Bios and Hasenclever had signed it.— 
173, 203 
241 This refers to William I's rescript signed by him and Bismarck (Erlass  vom  4. Ja­
nuar 1882.  Deutscher  Reichs-Anzeiger und  Königlich Preussischer  Staats-Anzeiger, 7 Janu­
ary 1882). William demanded that, in future, all government acts be regarded as 
a constitutional expression of the King's own opinion. Referring to Art. 49 of the 
Prussian Constitution, which granted the King of Prussia the right to personally 
direct government policies, William laid down that his ministers and officials 
should curb any 'doubt' about the Prussian King's 'constitutional right'.— 175, 
178 
242 Nihilists—Russian intellectuals of humble origin (the 1860s). They flatly refused 
to accept the ruling ideology, morality and way of  life. Nihilism was not a compre­
hensive philosophy; the only thing its proponents shared was their rejection of 
things as they stood. The term 'nihilism' was later applied by the reactionary press 
to all revolutionaries at the moments when the class struggle began to mount.— 
175, 470 
243 Demagogues  in Germany were members of the opposition movement after the liber­
ation of the country from Napoleonic rule. The name became current after the 
Karlsbad Conference of Ministers of the German States in August 1819, which 
adopted a special decision on the persecution of the demagogues.— 175 
244 In June and September 1881 Count Nikolai Ignatiev, the Russian Minister of the 
Interior, assembled 'knowledgeable' Zemstvo representatives of his own choosing 
to discuss some of the practical issues of domestic policy: resettlement, consumption 
of alcohol, etc. In this connection, 12 Zemstvo assemblies requested that Zemstvo 
representatives be involved in the legislative activities not on isolated occasions but 
on a permanent basis, and that they be selected not by the government but by the 
Zemstvos themselves.— 175 
245 Sorge wrote to Marx on 27 December 1881: 'Come over to us, old friend, and be-

come one of  us! We will offer you as good a home as we can, and new surroundings 
and old work will in time alleviate your sorrow and sustain you.'—177 
246 An ironic allusion to William I's flight to England at the time of the March 1848 
revolution in Germany (up to 1861, William was heir to the Prussian throne and 
held the title of Prince of Prussia). In England, he maintained close contacts with 
the country's leading politicians.— 178 
24' Marx is referring to Theodor Mommsen's, Eugen Richter's and Albert Hänel's as­
surances of their loyalty to the crown voiced at the German Reichstag sessions in 
November-December  1881.—  178 
248 Engels first came to England in the latter half of November 1842 to study com­
merce at a cotton mill in Manchester belonging to the firm of Ermen & Engels. 
Engels' visit lasted until 26 August 1844.—178 
249 Marx sent a photograph of himself to Cologne for the second time probably in late 
January 1882, having received Amalia Daniels' letter of  19 January. On 5 Febru­
ary, Roland Daniels Jun. acknowledged receipt of the photograph and explained 
the confusion with the post by the fact that several persons of the same name 
resided in Cologne.— 180 
250 The Comité national (National Committee) of the French Workers' Party was set 
up on the initiative of its Right-wing leaders Malon and Brousse in mid-October 
1881,  just before the Rheims Congress of the party (see Note 223), which endorsed 
it. The National Committee was formed on the principle of equal representation of 
all six federations (five persons from each) which constituted the French Workers' 
Party at the time: the Federative Union of the Centre (see Note 265), the Eastern 
Federative Union, the Northern Federation, the Federative Union of the South, 
the Federative Union of the West, and the Algerian Federation. To all practical 
purposes, only the first three federations were in existence at the time, whereas the 
other three existed only on paper and their representatives, who were under Ma-
Ion's and Brousse's influence, did not have legal powers. Thus, with the exception of 
the five Collectivists (Guesdists), who represented the Northern Federation, the re­
maining 25 members of the National Committee were Malon's and Brousse's follow­
ers, which placed the party leadership into the hands of Right-wing elements.— 
181 
251 On the minimum programme, see Note 68. Jules Joffrin, nominated as the party 
candidate at the elections to the Paris City Council, set forth his election pro­
gramme in a speech made in the Monmartre district of Paris. In it, he totally ig­
nored the theoretical part of the programme drawn up by Marx and replaced a 
number of important and quite concrete points (the issue of the  8-hour  day, 
collective property, etc.) in its practical part by vague phrases. On 8 January 1882, 
using its advantage in the National Committee (see Note 250), Malon's and 
Brousse's group managed to get Joffrin's opportunistic election programme ap­
proved.—181 
252 This may refer to the note 'Russland' carried by the  Kölnische  Zeitung on 25 July 
1881.  The note refuted the opinion of certain European newspapers that General 
Mikhail Skobelev, who visited Paris in the summer of  1881,  had been instructed by 
the Russian government to pave the way for a Franco-Russian alliance, open ne­
gotiations on the abolition of political émigrés' right of asylum, etc. The  Kölnische 
Leitung stated that Skobelev's visit was a private one.— 182

253 The Sonvillier Circular (Circulaire à toutes les fédérations de l'Association Inter­
nationale des Travailleurs. Sonvillier,  1871 )  was passed by the Bakuninistjura Fed­
eration at the congress in Sonvillier on 12 November 1871. It was spearheaded 
against the decisions of the London Conference of the International (1871) and at­
tacked the activities of its General Council. It demanded the immediate convoca­
tion of a general congress to revise the Rules of the International along anarchist 
lines.  The General Council responded by issuing a private circular 'Fictitious Splits 
in the International' written by Marx and Engels, which exposed the Bakuninists' 
efforts to split the organisation (see present edition, Vol. 23).—182 
254 The mounting peasant movement in Russia in the 1860s-70s caused by the peas­
ants'  desperate condition forced the tsarist government to agree to slightly reduce the 
redemption payments. The law of 28 December 1881 reduced peasants' redemp­
tion payments by one ruble for a plot per person in Russia, and by 16 per cent 
in the Ukraine.— 182 
255 The phrase 'to go to Canossa' goes back to the humiliating pilgrimage undertaken 
to Pope Gregory VII at Canossa Castle (Northern Italy) in 1077 by the German 
Emperor Henry IV in the course of the protracted struggle between the emperors 
and the popes for the investiture. 
In May 1872, Bismarck, who had launched a campaign against the Catholic 
Church that supported the separatist and anti-Prussian sentiments in Germany, 
stated: 'We shall not go to Canossa.' During the campaign (the Kulturkampf), 
a law was promulgated on 4 May 1874 which restricted the powers of the consis­
tory (ecclesiastical court). However, in the late 1870s, when Bismarck needed the 
support of the Catholic Party of the Centre to combat the workers' movement and 
the growing influence of the German Social-Democratic Party, he abrogated 
nearly all the laws passed during the Kulturkampf campaign, had the principal 
advocates of the anti-Catholic policy resign, and made his peace with the new 
Pope Leo XIII. By 'the pilgrimage to Canossa' Engels is ironically referring to the 
abrogation of the law of 4 May 1874 effected by 233 votes to 115 in the Reichstag 
on 12 January 1882.—182 
256 By referring to  ultramontanes  Engels meant the Centre (see Note 225). 
Particularists— members of a political movement in Germany which emerged 
after the establishment of the German Empire and opposed the policies of the Prus­
sian government. The movement spread among the ruling classes of the petty and 
medium-sized South-Western German states. The top Catholic clergy, landowners 
and the bourgeoisie of these states resented Germany's unification under Prussian 
supremacy believing it to be an encroachment on their rights. As a result they cher­
ished separatist aspirations, expressed their discontent with Bismarck's policy of 
Prussianisation of Germany, demanded autonomy from central power and im­
mutability of local private rights and privileges. In the Reichstag the Particular­
ists, who represented the states with a predominantly Roman Catholic popula­
tion, supported the Party of the Centre. 
The Poles, Danes and Alsatians formed independent groups in the Reichstag. 
They also supported the Catholic Party of the Centre. Their presence in the 
Reichstag was accounted for by the existence in the German Empire of national 
minorities discontented with the policy of enforced Germanisation. It was pursued 
with particular ruthlessness by Bismarck in the Polish provinces annexed by Ger-

many in 1814-15 and in Alsace and Lorraine, which Germany received as a result 
of the Franco-Prussian War of  1870-71.  The Danish deputies in the Reichstag re­
presented Schleswig and Holstein, annexed by Prussia in 1867. The Poles and the 
Alsatians were the most powerful among the national parliamentary groups. 
The men of  Progress  were members of a Prussian bourgeois party founded in 
June 1861. The Party of Progress demanded Germany's unification under Prussian 
supremacy, the convocation of an all-Germany parliament and the establishment of 
a strong liberal ministry accountable to the Chamber of Deputies. In 1866, a Right 
wing split off from the Party of Progress, a section that capitulated before Bismarck 
and set up a National Liberal Party (see Note 15). The vacillations in the policies 
pursued by the Party of Progress mirrored the instability of the merchant bourgeoisie, 
small industrialists, and a section of the craftsmen, on whom it relied. In 1884, the 
Party of Progress united with the Left wing of the National Liberal Party that had 
split off from it to form the German Party of Free Thinkers (Deutsche Freisinnige 
Partei).— 182 
257 At the Reichstag meeting of 9 January 1852, Bismarck was forced to admit that 
the working masses were distrustful of the government's attempts to improve their 
condition.—183 
258 This refers to the letters Leo Frankel (18 December 1881) and Walery Wrôblewski 
(7 December 1881) sent to Marx on the occasion of his wife's death. 
At the time, Frankel was detained in the prison in Vâc (Austria-Hungary), 
where he was placed in June 1881 on the charge of breach of the press law. 
By Wrôblewski's 'Polish party' in Geneva Marx had in mind a group of Polish 
Marxist refugees with whom Wrôblewski became close in the late 1870s.—183 
259 In July 1878, George Howell, a former member of the General Council of the 
International, published a libellous article, 'The History of the International Asso­
ciation', in The  Nineteenth Century  monthly review. The author calumniated the his­
tory of the First International and Marx's role in it. In August of the same year, 
Marx published an article called 'Mr. George Howell's History of the Interna­
tional Working-Men's Association' in The Secular Chronicle, and Record of Free-
thought  Progress,  Vol. X, No. 5 (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 234-39). 
In 1881, Howell stood for election to the House of Commons in Stafford but 
was voted down at the elections.— 185 
260 Engels wrote this letter at two sittings, on 25 and 31 January 1882.

265 The  Federative  Union (full name, Union federative du Centre, the Federative Union 
of the Centre), one of the six associations constituting the French Workers' Party, 
had been formed by April 1880. An association of the party's organisations in 
Paris,  it consisted of 80 groups. The Union's leadership was in the hands of the par­
ty's Right opportunist wing, the Possibilists — Brousse, Malon and Joffrin (editors of 
the Prolétaire). At the meetings of the Federative Union of the Centre on 17 and 
24 January 1882, the Egalité editorial board and all party groups siding with the 
Guesdists were expelled from the Federative Union. Only 28 groups voted in fa­
vour, that is, slightly more than one-third of the groups making up the Federative 
Union (48 groups out of the 80 were present at the meetings mentioned above). 
After their expulsion from the Federative Union of the Centre, the Guesdists 
founded a revolutionary federation and called it the Federation of the Centre 
(Fédération du Centre).— 190, 332, 355, 388 
266 The Holy Alliance — an association of European monarchs founded in Septem­
ber 1815 on the initiative of the Russian Tsar Alexander I and the Austrian Chan­
cellor Metternich to suppress the revolutionary movement.—191, 273 
267 The national liberation movement for the unification of Italy ended in 1861 with 
the establishment of a single Italian state (only Rome, which was incorporated 
into the Italian state after the abolition of the Pope's secular authority in 1870, re­
mained outside it at the time). The event paved the way for the expansion of the 
independent workers' movement.— 191 
268 Little Germany — a plan for the unification of Germany under the Prussian aegis 
minus Austria. 
Engels is referring here to the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which gave birth 
to the North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund), a federative state 
formed in 1867 to replace the disintegrated German Confederation. The establish­
ment of the North German Confederation was a major step towards the national 
unification of Germany. The Confederation ceased to exist in January 1871, when 
the German Empire was founded.—191 
269 By the Lassallean party Engels implies the General Association of German Work­
ers, the first national German workers' organisation founded on 23 May 1863 at 
the congress of workers' associations in Leipzig. The main organisational docu­
ments and the programme were drawn up by Ferdinand Lassalle, who became the 
organisation's first president. The errors in Lassalle's propaganda strategy and in 
his tactics, as well as the anti-democratic structure of the Association gave rise to 
a strong opposition, the bulk of which joined the Eisenachers. 
The Eisenach  Party — the Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany set up 
at the General Congress of German, Swiss and Austrian Social-Democrats held in 
Eisenach on 7-9 August 1869. The party programme declared support for the prin­
ciples of the First International, although Lassallean ideas still wielded a consider­
able influence in it. At the Congress in Gotha in 1875, the Eisenachers and the Las-
salleans formed a single party of the working class, which called itself the Socialist 
Workers' Party of Germany up to 1890.—191, 342

resentative. The Federal Diet ceased to exist together with the German Confedera­
tion at the time of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.—191 
271 A reference to the constitution of 1860 (the so-called October diploma — 
Oktoberdiplom). It gave Hungary, which formed part of the Austrian monarchy, 
certain rights (the convocation of a Hungarian parliament, the use of the Hun­
garian language in administration, etc.) The crisis of the Austrian Empire and 
mounting popular discontent led to its transformation in 1867 into the dual 
Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Hungary was recognised as a sovereign part of the 
state.  Political consolidation promoted the development of capitalism there. In 
1868,  the first workers' organisations emerged in the country, the Budapest Work­
ers' Union and the General Workers' Union (subsequently the latter became the 
leading organisation of the socialist workers' movement).— 191 
272 A reference to the events of 1873-75, when the Bismarck government tried to pro­
voke a war with France. The Russian government resolutely sided with France. 
Thanks to the pressure being put on the German government by Russia, Austria 
and Britain, Bismarck's attempt failed.— 192 
273 In January 1882, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had been occupied by Austria in 
1878 under the terms of the Berlin Congress, witnessed an uprising provoked by 
the Austro-Hungarian government's law of 1881 on military conscription to be 
introduced in the occupied territories. The uprising reached its peak in the first 
half of February 1882. The Tsarist government tried to use it to promote its own 
ends.—192 
274 This refers to the national liberation insurrection of 1863-64 in the Polish territo­
ries belonging to Tsarist Russia. The insurrection was suppressed by the Russian 
government. 
The anonymous book, Berlin und St. Petersburg.  Preussische  Beiträge zur  Geschichte 
der Russisch-deutschen  Beziehungen,  Leipzig, 1880, was the work of the German politi­
cal writer Julius Eckardt. Appendix 2, to which Engels refers here, deals with the 
Polish insurrection of 1863-64.—193 
275 This refers, above all, to Walery Wroblewski and Jarosiaw Dombrowski. Wrôb-
lewski, appointed general, commanded one of the Commune's three armies. Gener­
al Dombrowski, who first headed the defence operations at one of the key sectors 
of the front, later commanded the 1st Army of the Commune and in early May 
1871 was appointed commander-in-chief of its armed forces.— 193 
276 The reference is to the programme advanced in the days of the Cracow uprising 
(February 1846) by Dembowski, who voiced the interests of the peasantry and the 
urban poor (to give land to those who had none, radically to improve the workers' 
condition by setting up national, or 'social', workshops). The National Govern­
ment formed in Cracow on 22 February issued a manifesto announcing the aboli­
tion of feudal duties and taxes. The Cracow uprising was suppressed early in 
March 1846. In November, Austria, Prussia and Russia signed a treaty on the an­
nexation of the city to the Austrian empire.—193 
277 Engels is referring to the 'liberal course' proclaimed by William, Prince (King 
from 1861) of Prussia, in October 1858, when he assumed the regency. In actual 
fact, not one of the reforms expected by the bourgeoisie was carried out. William's

278 In early February 1882, following medical advice, Marx took a trip to Algiers, 
where he stayed from 20 February to 2 May. On the way there, he stopped over in

280 Under the law proposed by the Minister of Justice Dufaure, and passed by the 
French National Assembly on 14 March 1872, membership of the International

281 The reference is to the situation that emerged after the assassination of Emperor 
Alexander II on 1 March 1881, when Alexander III sat it out in Gatchina (the 
Tsar's summer residence near St Petersburg) fearing fresh terrorist acts by the se­
cret Executive Committee of the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) organisation.— 
208 
282 In the course of his visit to France in the winter of 1882, General Skobelev had 
a meeting with Serbian students in Paris (17 February) at which he talked about 
the need to emancipate the Slav peoples of Europe. As in his subsequent state­
ments, which gave rise to a great deal of anxiety and commotion in Europe, Sko­
belev lashed out at Germany, describing a war with it as inevitable and urging a 
Russo-French alliance.— 209

285 In a letter of 24 February 1882, Jenny Longuet wrote to Marx that her sister 
Eleanor had turned down Prosper Lissagaray's proposal of marriage.— 219 
286 This letter was first published in Russian among Marx's 16 letters from the Lon­
guet family archive by the magazine Nachalo (Beginning), No. 5, 1899. Its trans­

1899).  The Editors are not in possession of the original letter. It was published in

For Marx's and Engels' criticism of the Lassallean law, see present edition, 
Vol. 24, p. 69. 
By Ricardo's and Turgot's statements on the law of minimum wages, Marx

richesses  (1766) in Œuvres de  Turgot, new ed., by E. Daire, Vol. 1, Paris, 1844, p. 10. 
Marx's critique of Ricardo's and Turgot's ideas on this issue is contained, in par­

292 An ironic reference to the sycophantic statements by the German poets Friedrich 
Bodenstedt and Friedrich Theodor Vischer, a Hegelian, author of a four-volume 
work on aesthetics. Comparing them to Horace and Virgil, Marx is alluding to the 
fact that those Roman poets wrote panegyrics and odes to Emperor Augustus 
(Octavianus).— 235 
293 The reference is to the proofs of the Russian translation of Marx's and Engels'  pref­
ace to the second Russian edition of the Manifesto of  the Communist  Party, a project 
initiated by Georgi Plekhanov, who had also done the translation. The request for 
the preface was made through Pyotr Lavrov. Marx and Engels wrote it on 21 Jan­
uary 1882, and despatched it to Lavrov on 23 January. It appeared for the first 
time in the magazine  JVarodnaya Volya  on 5 February. The Manifesto of  the Commu­
nist Party with this preface appeared in print in 1882 in Geneva in the Russian  Socio-
Revolutionary Library series. 
Engels failed to obtain the German original of the preface from Lavrov, as the 
latter had left it among his papers in Paris (at the time, Lavrov was expelled from 
Paris on the insistence of the Russian government, and moved to London). Lavrov 
did not send Engels a copy of the German original until about 17 April, but earlier, 
on 13 April, Der Sozialdemokrat, No. 16, featured the preface in translation from 
the Russian text printed by  JVarodnaya  Volya. Engels did not like the translation 
(see this volume, p. 244). The German original of the preface was published in

elections of 1881, Most urged his followers in Germany to do their best to prevent 
Bebel's and Liebknecht's election to the Reichstag (for criticism of Most' s and Die 
Freiheit's position, see this volume, p. 7).— 236 
297 The reference is to the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see 
Note 8), which in the 1880s had its offices at 49 Tottenham Street, Tottenham 
Court Road, London, W.— 236, 330

tween late June and 20 July 1881.—238 
299 L'Union Nationale, a French insurance company where Paul Lafargue was em­
ployed at the time.— 240 
300 This refers to the sequel to Paul Lafargue's article '/bmaceHie no3eiueAi>HOÜ  COÖCT-
BeHHOCTH  BO OpaHtjiii' ('The Movement of Land Property in France'). It was pub­
lished in full in Russian in the Ustoi (Principles) magazine, Nos. 3-4 and 6, 
1882.—240 
301 The reference is to Charles V's abortive campaign of  1541  in Algeria (which at the 
time formed part of the Ottoman Empire) under the pretext of suppressing the pi­
rates who had made it their base. Having suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of 
the Turkish troops near the town of Algiers, the Spanish troops were driven from 
the country's other strongholds.— 241 
302 Engels learned about this from Lavrov's note of 6 April 1882.— 244 
303 In early April 1882, the Social-Democratic deputy Bruno Geiser received a pro­
vocative anonymous letter from New York about preparations for an insurrection in 
Germany. Geiser informed the police about the letter and made a 
statement to the effect that the German Social-Democrats had never aimed at a 
revolution. The leader 'Bekennt Farbe!' in Der Sozialdemokral, No. 16, 13 April 
1882,  sharply criticised Geiser's statement and contained a reminder that the party 
was indeed trying to bring forward a revolution in Germany.— 244 
304 Probably a reference to one of Marx's visits to his uncle Lion Philips in Zalt-
Bommel (Holland). Marx visited him between 28 February and 16 March 1861, 
late August-early September 1862, 21 December 1863-19 February 1864 and 19 
March-8 April 1865.—246 
305 On 20 April 1882, the  Kölnische  Teilung, No. 109, carried a report marked 'Kon-
stantinopel' which exposed the machinations of Baron Moritz Hirsch, a notorious 
Austrian railway speculator to whom Turkey had granted a railway concession.— 
247 
306 An allusion to the poetic efforts of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, whose trivial verses, 
later completely forgotten, diverged from proper German grammar and provoked 
a great deal of ridicule.— 249

make certain concessions, notably to repeal the emergency measures introduced in 
1881 (see Note 123). On 2 May 1882, the leaders of the Irish national movement 
were released from prison. The Viceroy of Ireland Francis Thomas Cowper and 
Secretary for Ireland William Forster, both advocates of emergency measures, re­
signed.— 251 
309 Engels alludes to the numerous terrorist acts in Ireland in 1882 provoked by the 
intolerable position of the tenants there: twice as many landlords, their agents, 
British government officials, and others were assassinated as compared with the 
previous years.— 252 
3,0 Having left Algiers on 2 May 1882 on his doctor's advice, Marx travelled to 
Monte Carlo via Marseilles and Nice, and lived there for a month, up to  3 June.— 
252, 253, 369 
3 ' ' Engels stopped over in Genoa on 5-6 October 1849 on his way from Switzerland 
(he had emigrated there after the defeat of the Baden-Palatinate uprising) to En­
gland. He had to travel via Italy since he was liable to be arrested if he entered Ger­
many or France.— 253 
312 The newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Cavendish, and the dep­
uty of the previous secretary, Thomas Henry Burke, were assassinated on 6 May 
1882 in Phoenix Park, Dublin, by members of the terrorist organisation called 
The Invincible, which included former Fenians (the Fenians were a secret Irish 
revolutionary, or republican, brotherhood, which fought for Irish independence 
and the establishment of an Irish republic in the 1850s-60s). Marx and Engels dis­
approved of the terrorist and anarchist tactics of the Fenians' epigones (see this 
volume, p. 247).—254, 286 
3 '3 In the manuscript the letter is dated 10 March. This is a slip of the pen, since En-
gels is replying here to the question Eduard Bernstein asked about Mary-Isis in his 
letter of 4 May.— 256 
3 '4 The reference is to the exchange of opinions between Engels and Bernstein con­
cerning Engels' article 'Bruno Bauer and Early Christianity' written in the second 
half of April 1882. It was published in Der Sozialdemokrat, 4 and 11 May.— 256 
315 See present edition, Vol. 35, Chapter III.—257 
316 In his letter to Engels of 4 October 1882, Bernstein made inquiries about the Zurich 
businessman Louis Bamberger, who had claimed he knew Marx, Engels and Frei-
ligrath.—258 
3 ' ' Engels is referring to Bebel's letter to Marx of 12 December 1881 in which he offer­
ed Marx his condolences on the death of his wife, Jenny. He also wrote about the 
difficulties being encountered by Der Sozialdemokrat and the results of the Reichs­
tag elections of 1881, in which the Social-Democrats had done quite well.— 259 
3 '8 Engels is referring to the materials carried by Der Sozialdemokrat, Nos. 4, 5 and 
9 on 19, 26 January and 23 February 1882. They gave a rebuff to Ernst Breuel's 
two open letters (Nos. 4 and 9,  19 January and 23 February) in which he accused 
the editors of bias, anarchist leanings, etc., in connection with their criticism of 
Wilhelm Hasenclever's and Wilhelm Bios' opportunist stand (see Note 240).— 259

Middle Ages in the town of Echternach (Luxembourg) as a token of gratitude for 
the subsidence of the St Vitus' dance, epidemic that raged there in 1374. The 
members of the procession do not just move forward but make more complicated 
forward and backward steps.— 262 
320 The German playwright and literary critic Amadeus Gottfried Adolf Müllner 
gave pride of place in his plays to fate and predestination. Necessary romantic at­
tributes of the so-called tragedies of fate were unlucky days, ill omens, fatal 
weapons, etc.; the plot usually had a tragic end.— 263 
321 Presumably this refers to Engels' letter received by Marx before 20 May 1882.— 
266 
322 Here and below, Marx ironically alludes to Offenbach's comic opera The Duchess 
of Gerolstein;  in the latter half of the 19th century, the leading part in it was played 
by the famous French actress and singer Hortense Schneider.— 268 
323 On his way from Monte Carlo to Argenteuil Marx stopped over in Cannes be­
tween 3 and 5 June 1882.—272 
324 Garibaldi died on 2 June 1882 of bronchial catarrh.—274 
325 A joking allusion to the Old Testament dictums about dust being the serpent's 
meat (Genesis 3:14, and Isaiah 65:25), as well as to Darwin's book The  Formation  of 
Vegetable  Mould,  through the Action of Worms, with  Observations  on Their Habits, Lon­
don, 1881. According to Darwin, worms help in the formation of humus by dig­
ging up the earth and passing it through their bowels.— 274 
326 An ironic allusion to Adolph von Knigge's work Ueber den Umgang mit Menschen 
(Hanover, 1804) laying down the rules of human behaviour in contacts with other 
people. Knigge's opus abounded in superficial discourse and truisms.— 274 
327 Between 6 June and 22 August, Marx stayed with his daughter Jenny Longuet in 
Argenteuil.—275, 305, 369 
328 After more than nine years of emigration in London Paul Lafargue returned to 
Paris in early April 1882.—275, 276 
329 xhis meeting held by the Democratic Federation (see Note 158) on  11 June 1882, 
in which about 40,000 people took part, was in protest at the introduction of new 
Coercion Bills in Ireland (see Note 123).— 276 
330 The letter was published in English for the first time in the magazine  Science  and So­
ciety, Vol. II, No. 2, New York, 1938 (the first paragraph of the letter was omit­
ted).—278 
331 In a letter of 5 May 1882, Sorge asked Engels to pay for his subscription to several 
newspapers (promising to send him the money later) and to look through the 
English translation of the Manifesto of  the Communist Party which Engels had re­
ceived previously and which Sorge intended to publish in the United States. He 
also asked Engels for a preface or an afterword for this publication.— 278 
332 Engels ironically compares the opportunist-minded Social-Democratic deputies in 
the Reichstag with the bourgeois constitutionalists at the time of the 1848-49 revo­
lution in Germany, whom democratic republicans had nicknamed 'wailers' ('Heu­
ler').— 279

514 Notes 
333 This article outlined the programme of the opportunist trend in the German So­
cial-Democratic Party after the promulgation of the Anti-Socialist Law in Ger­
many in October 1878. Marx and Engels subjected the article to a detailed anal­
ysis and crushing critique in their 'Circular Letter to August Bebel, Wilhelm 
Liebknecht, Wilhelm Bracke and Others', III. The Manifesto of the Zurich Trio 
(see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 262-69).—280 
334 The Brimstone Gang (Schwefelbande) —the name of a students' association at Jena 
University in the 1770s, whose members were notorious for their brawls. Subse­
quently, the phrase became widespread. In 1849-50, a group of German petty-
bourgeois refugees in Geneva were known by this name. In 1859, the Bonapartist 
agent Karl Vogt slanderously linked the activities of this 'Brimstone gang' with 
Marx and his followers. Marx dealt with the matter in his pamphlet Herr Vogt 
(present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 28-37).—281 
335 The event described by Engels took place during the Baden-Palatinate uprising in 
May-July 1849, in which he was involved (see his work 'The Campaign for the 
German Imperial Constitution', present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 149-239).— 281 
336 The first article which appeared in Der Sozialdemokrat  under Engels' name was the 
obituary 'Jenny Marx, née von Westphalen' (No. 50, 8 December 1881; see pres­
ent edition, Vol. 24, pp. 422-24). But he considered his first official contribution to 
the newspaper to be the article 'Bruno Bauer and Early Christianity' (No. 19, 
4 May 1882).—283 
337 The reference is to the Congress of the Federative Union of the Centre held on 14-
21 May 1882 in Paris, which confirmed the decisions to expel the editors of  L'Ega­
lité passed by the meetings of the Federative Union of the Centre held on 17 and 
24 January (see Note 265). The note entitled 'Frankreich' in Der Sozialdemokrat, 
No. 23, 1 June 1882 denounced the congress decision on the expulsion of the Ega­
lité group. The passage mentioned in this letter appeared, in translation, in L'Ega­
lité, No. 27, 3rd series, 11 June 1882. The Editors do not have the issue of the 
Prolétaire with the reply to this.—  283,  341 
338 Adolf Hepner, a German Social-Democrat who had emigrated to the United 
States, wrote to Engels on 3 May 1882 asking for permission to reprint Marx's 
and Engels' works in the USA. (For Engels' reply to Hepner on his own and Marx's 
behalf,  see this volume, pp. 294-95).— 284 
339 On 18 May 1882, Der Sozialdemokrat (No. 21) featured a leader 'Die Situation in 
Irland' written by Bernstein under the pen-name Leo. Engels considered it neces­
sary to explain his stand in a letter to Bernstein. The latter passed it on to Lieb­
knecht, who included a major part of it, without the author's permission and with 
editorial comments, in the article 'Zur irischen Frage' printed by Der Sozialdemo­
krat No. 29 on  13 July 1882. Liebknecht supplied the letter with a polemical conclu­
sion and the following editorial introduction: 'A friend of Ireland, familiar with the 
country and the people as few people are, writes to us from London about his dis­
agreement on individual points with the opinion set forth in Der Sozialdemokrat, 
No. 21.' Engels voiced his protest at the unauthorised publication in a letter to 
Bernstein of 9 August 1882 (see this volume, pp. 300-01). 
Part of the original has been lost, which is why the letter is printed according to

340 Ribbonmen—participants in the peasant movement that arose in Northern Ireland 
in the late 18th century. They were united in secret groups, whose emblem was 
a strip of green cloth. 
Whiteboys—participants in the Irish peasant movement, which in the 1760s 
grew into a large-scale rebellion against the rule of English landlords. To make 
themselves unrecognisable, these men, who usually acted at night, painted their 
faces black and wore white shirts. In the 19th century, many of their societies merged 
with those of the Ribbonmen, but some continued to operate under their old name 
up to the end of the century. 
Captain Rock—the name of the members of the various secret peasant societies 
that emerged and operated in Ireland between the second half of the 18th and the 
mid-19th century. 
Captain Moonlight—the usual signature under warnings sent by the Ribbon-
men's secret society to landlords.— 285 
541 Catholic Emancipation—the abolition of restrictions on the political rights of 
Catholics in Ireland by the British Parliament in 1829 as a result of a mass move­
ment. Catholics were granted the right to stand for election to Parliament and to 
hold certain government offices. Simultaneously, the property qualification was 
raised fivefold. The British ruling classes hoped this manoeuvre would bring the 
élite of the Irish bourgeoisie and Catholic landowners over to their side and cause 
a split in the Irish national movement.— 286 
342 A reference to the conflict between the USA and Great Britain caused by the lat-
ter's aid to the Southern states during the American Civil War of 1861-65. The 
British government built and equipped warships for the Southerners, which 
greatly undermined the Northerners' trade by their actions. Among the vessels was 
the Alabama, a privateering ship that sank 70 Northerners' vessels. After the war, 
the US government demanded that the British government make full reparations 
for the damage inflicted by the Alabama and other privateering vessels to the 
property of American citizens. Under the decision of an arbitration court passed in 
Geneva on 14 September 1872, Britain was to pay $15.5 mln to the United States, 
which it indeed did.— 287 
343 An allusion to the weekly newspaper Die Freiheit published in London by Johann 
Most, a German anarchist refugee, and edited by Karl Schneidt. The newspaper 
was obsessed with ultra-revolutionary rhetoric and notorious for its rude attacks 
against the policies and tactics of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany and its 
activists.— 289 
344 The reference is to the events that occurred at the congress of the Federative 
Union of the Centre held on 14-21 May 1882 (see Note 337). 
On the National  Committee,  see Note 250.— 289 
345 The Wyden  Conference  of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (August 1880) in­
structed the party leadership to set up a communication office that would establish 
and maintain contacts with the German Social-Democrats and the socialist parties 
and organisations in other countries.— 290

346 This refers to Franz Mehring's article in the bourgeois newspaper Weser-Leitung of 
2 July 1882. An opponent of the Social-Democratic movement at the time, Mehr-
ing lashed out against Der Sozialdemokrat.  He referred to Marx's and Engels' dis­
agreement with the editorial board and stressed the paper's 'lack of tact', for which, 
he alleged, German workers were being constantly persecuted. By way of conclu­
sion, Mehring promised further exposures of the newspaper. He also wrote about 
Marx's poor health and predicted he might be unable to complete his work on Cap­
ital. The Sozialdemokrat^ editors used the advice by Engels given here in an arti­
cle against Mehring written in quite harsh terms and printed under the heading 
'In eigener Sache' in No. 31, 27 July 1882—291, 299, 301, 377 
347 Engels is referring to his article 'Bruno Bauer and Early Christianity' published in 
Der Sozialdemokrat, Nos. 19 and 20 on 4 and 11 May 1882 (see present edition,

348 In a letter of  11 May 1882, Kautsky asked for Engels' opinion on the future of the

emigrated to the United States, asked Engels for permission to publish his and 
Marx's works in the Arbeiter- Library series.— 293 
351 A reference to Johann Most's pamphlet Kapital und Arbeit. Ein populärer Auszug 
aus 'Das Kapital' von Karl Marx. 2nd edition, Chemnitz [1876]. The first edition 
appeared in Chemnitz in 1873. On Liebknecht's request, Marx, with Engels' help, 
made changes in and additions to the second edition. For Marx's appraisal of this 
publication, see Engels' letter to Philip Van Patten of 18 April 1883, present edi­

352 A reference to the second Russian edition of Marx's and Engels' Manifesto of  the 
Communist Party (see Note 293).— 295 
353 The growth of the Egyptian national movement in the early 1880s (see Note 355) 
led to a provisional alliance between Britain and France. On the eve of the conflict 
with Egypt provoked by Britain in July 1882, there were differences of opinion 
among French politicians: the former Prime Minister Gambetta and Freycinet, 
who replaced him in January 1882 (see Note 356), favoured intervention. The rad­
ical leader Clemenceau, who sought revenge on Germany, opposed the idea of an 
invasion, insisting that it would further aggravate the Anglo-French contradictions 
and thus consolidate the position of Germany.— 296

355 In 1879-82, Egypt witnessed an upsurge of the national liberation movement 
against British and French capital which had established direct financial control 
over the country (in 1878, representatives of Britain and France were made minis­
ters of the Egyptian government and given the right of  veto).  The insurrection of 
the Cairo garrison forced the Khedive of Egypt (see Note 362) to issue a constitu-

tion in September 1881. In December, Egypt acquired a parliament led by the Na­
tional Party which had been founded that same year and represented a bloc of lib­
eral landowners and merchants with the patriotically minded officers and intel­
lectuals supported by the peasantry and petty bourgeoisie. The National Party set 
the country's independence as its target ('Egypt for Egyptians'). However, in the 
summer of 1882, having provoked a conflict with Egypt, Britain opened hostilities, 
which, despite the resistance of the Egyptian troops headed by Colonel Arabi, end­
ed in a British victory. In September, they captured Cairo, and Egypt became 
their colony to all intents and purposes. 
The public meetings of protest against the British aggression and the bombard­
ment of Alexandria mentioned by Marx were organised in Paris by the Federation 
of the Centre (see Note 230) in late July 1882 with the participation of the  Citoyen 
editors Henri Brissac, Jules Guesde and Paul Lafargue. The Guesdists' resolution 
on Egypt hailed Arabi Pasha and the National Party as worthy of the great mis­
sion they had assumed.—298, 301, 313, 317, 319, 323, 335 
356 Freycinet agreed to cooperation with Britain only in the Suez Canal zone. His 
proposal was turned down by the Chamber of Deputies on 29 July 1882, and his 
cabinet resigned.— 298 
35 ' Marx is referring to the Quadruple Alliance, the convention 'of the four powers, 
Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia, signed on  15 July 1840 in London. Its objec­
tive was to render military aid to the Sultan of Turkey against the Egyptian ruler 
Mohammed Ali to settle the Egyptian crisis of  1839-41,  which arose from the ri­
valry of the European powers over hegemony in Egypt and the Middle East.— 298 
358 Engels is referring to Johann Philipp Becker's letter of 2 August 1882, in reply to 
his own letter of 10 February 1882 (see this volume, pp. 196-98).— 300

360 The reference is to the French edition of Engels' work  Socialism:  Utopian and  Scien­
tific (see Note 20) and the plans for a German edition. Bernstein wrote to Engels 
about the need for such an edition on 7 July 1882 (see Note 378) and asked for 
a short afterword on Bismarck's state socialism.— 300, 336 
361 Der  Sozialdemokrat,  No. 32, 3 August 1882, published the article 'Die Socialdemok-
ratie und die egyptische Frage', which approved of the resolution passed by the meet­

368 On 2 August 1882 Paul Brousse, S. Deynaud, Victor Marouck and Louis Mouttet 
resigned from the Bataille editorial board. The reason they gave for their split 
with its editor-in-chief Prosper Lissagaray was secretary J. Labusquière's an­
nouncement that he was resigning from the paper because Lissagaray was restrict­
ing his initiative, controlling his actions and keeping a check on the contributions

was held in Berlin between 13 June and 13 July 1878. The congress ended with 
the signing of the Berlin Treaty revising the terms of the San Stefano preliminary 
treaty of 1878 that terminated the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 to the detriment 
of Russia and the Slav peoples of the Balkans. The territory of self-governing Bul­
garia defined by the San Stefano Treaty was more than halved; the Bulgarian dis­
tricts south of the Balkans were to form an autonomous province called Eastern 
Rumelia and remain under the Sultan; and the territory of Montenegro was sig­
nificantly curtailed. The Berlin Treaty confirmed the article of the San Stefano 
Treaty that returned to Russia the part of Bessarabia lost in 1856 but it also sanc­
tioned the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary.— 319,

edition, Vol. 24, pp. 457-59). He also supplemented it by his essay 'The Mark' 
(ibid., pp. 439-56) on the emergence and development of landed property in Ger­
many. The work was finished in September 1882, and the pamphlet was printed in 
Hottingen-Zurich at the end of the year and was on sale in early 1883 under the ti­
tle Die Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft. — 324, 331, 344,

379 The plan for a series of articles or a pamphlet about Bismarck and Lassalle was not 
carried out by Engels. — 324 
380 Engels touches here on the Lassallean tenet about 'a fair distribution of the pro­
ceeds of labour', which found expression in the Gotha Programme. Marx analysed 
it in his work Critique of the Gotha Programme (present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 83-
88).—  324 
381 This refers to the merger of the two German workers' parties, the Eisenachers and 
the Lassalleans (see Note 269), which took place at the Gotha Unity Congress held 
between 22 and 27 May 1875.—324, 343 
382 At the 29 May meeting of the Gotha Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of 
Germany (27-29 May  1877),  Johann Most proposed that the party's central print­
ed organ should no longer feature articles like Engels' pieces criticising Dühring. 
He was supported by Carl Julius Vahlteich. August Bebel suggested a compro­
mise:  Vorwärts was to terminate publication of Engels' articles against Dühring, 
which were to appear as a separate pamphlet put out by Vorwärts publishers. 
Wilhelm Liebknecht resolutely opposed Most's and Vahlteich's proposal, reminding 
the audience that the decision to have Engels' works published had been passed 
by the previous congress, that, in significance, they were second only to Marx's 
Capital, and that they were essential to promote the interests of the party. Liebknecht 
made an amendment to Bebel's proposal: to publish such articles in the Vorwärts 
theoretical supplement or in Die Zukunft magazine, or as separate pamphlets. The 
congress approved Bebel's proposal with Liebknecht's amendment. Parts II and III 
of Anti-Duhring were published in the supplement to the Vorwärts. — 325

Zurich as a separate pamphlet entitled Aufhebung des  Sozialistengesetzes?  Ein Wort

386 On 15 September 1882, La Bataille and Le Citoyen carried notices of Bebel's 
death. On 16 September, the Journal de Genève reported that Bebel died in 
Zwickau.— 328 
387 Engels did not carry this plan through.— 332 
388 Marx and Engels repeatedly wrote about taxation in the Neue  Rheinische  Teilung in 
1848-49 (see, e. g., 'No More Taxes!!!', 'Appeal', 'The Trial of the Rhenish District 
Committee of Democrats', present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 36, 41 and 323-39). In 1850, 
Marx took up the issue of taxes in his work The Class Struggles in France. 1848 to 
1850; it was also dealt with in Marx's and Engels' 'Address of the Central Au­
thority to the League, March 1850' and some other works (see present edition, 
Vol. 10, pp. 45-145, 277-87).—332 
389 An allusion to the notices of Marx's death printed by some German bourgeois pa­
pers in late 1881.—335 
390 See also Note 346.-335 
391 An allusion to the Biblical legend about the Jews' flight from Egyptian captivity. 
In 1875, assisted by the Rothschild banking house in Britain and in France 
(Erlanger was the Rothschilds' representative in Egypt), the British Prime Minis­
ter Disraeli bought for the British government the Suez Canal shares belonging to 
the Egyptian Khedive.— 337 
392 On his way back from Switzerland to London, from 28 September to the first days 
of October Marx stayed with his daughter Jenny Longuet in Argenteuil, whence 
he made several trips to Paris.— 337 
393 In a letter to Engels of 28 September 1882, Laura Lafargue wrote that on 26 Sep­
tember, on their way from Vevey to France, she and Marx had met Johann Phi­
lipp Becker in Geneva. Bad weather drove them away the next day.— 337 
394 The reference is to the two congresses of French socialists held simultaneously in 
the autumn of 1882: that of the Possibilists in St-Étienne and that of the Guesdists 
(Marxists) in Roanne. 
At the regular Congress of the French Workers' Party convened in St-Etienne 
on 25 September 1882, a split took place. The Marxist (Guesdist) deputies left the 
Congress and assembled in Roanne on 26 September, declaring themselves the 
Sixth Congress of the French Workers' Party. The Possibilists, who stayed in 
St-Etienne, rejected, both formally and essentially, the programme drawn up with 
Marx's participation and approved at the Congress in Le Havre in November 
1880 (see Note 68), and granted the districts the right to produce their own elec­
tion manifestos. In Engels' words, in the programme, approved by the St-Etienne 
Congress after a revision of its preamble, its 'proletarian class character has been 
eliminated' (see this volume, pp. 341-42). The congress expelled from the party 
the leaders and activists of its Marxist wing: Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue, Emile 
Massard, Gabriel Deville, Fréjac and Gustave Bazin, and approved a new name 
for the party, Federation française des travailleurs socialistes révolutionnaires. 
The Marxist congress in Roanne, which sat up to 1 October, confirmed its 
commitment to the Marxist programme and retained the old name, the French 
Workers' Party. It had its stronghold among workers in the major industrial cen­
tres and certain groups of the Paris proletariat, mainly at big factories. The Possi-

bilists were followed by Parisian artisans, as well as by workers in the south (Mar­
seilles) and west (Brittany), who were still under the influence of petty-bourgeois 
ideas.—339, 341, 350, 361, 406, 408 
395 Marx paraphrases the beginning of a saying popular in the early Middle Ages in 
the European countries: 'The devil was sick, the devil a monk would be; the devil 
was well, the devil a monk was he'.— 339 
396 Radicals (the 1880s and 1890s) — a French parliamentary group that had split off 
from the bourgeois party of moderate republicans ('opportunists'). Their leader 
was Clemenceau. The radicals put forward a bourgeois-democratic programme 
virtually abandoned by the 'parent' party: abolition of the Senate, separation of 
the Church from the state, introduction of progressive income taxes. In order to 
win voters over to its side, the group also demanded shorter working hours, disabil­
ity pensions, and some other social and economic steps.— 342 
397 An allusion to Vollmar's second article, 'Aufhebung des Ausnahmegesetzes?' (see 
Note 383).—342 
398 It has not been established just what material Engels enclosed with the letter. It 
may be the article 'Aus Frankreich' featured by Der Sozialdemokrat,  No. 45, 2 No­
vember 1882.—344 
399 Coup  de Jarnac — a treacherous blow. The expression originated with the name of 
one of the fighters in a duel that took place on 10 July 1547, Guy Chabot de Jar­
nac, who dealt his adversary a cunningly aimed surprise blow, which proved 
lethal.— 344 
400 The reference is to the challenge to a duel sent by Prosper Lissagaray to Paul La-
fargue; likening Lissagaray to the French politician and journalist Paul Adolph 
Granier de Cassagnac, Engels is ironically hinting at Cassagnac's scandalous press 
publications, which led to a number of duels and trials for libel.— 345 
401 Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in The Labour Monthly, 
London, 1933, Vol. 15, No. 9.-346 
402 In August 1882, during a miners' strike at Montceau-les-Mines the anarchists 
staged a number of provocations, laying the blame on the strikers. The arrested 
men were brought to court in October.— 347, 406 
403 A reference to the first Factory Act passed by the Swiss government on 23 March 
1877,  which came into force on 1 March 1878 as the Union Law on the Labour 
Conditions at Factories (das Bundesgesetz betreffend die Arbeit in den Fabri­
ken).— 347, 364, 373 
404 Ringleader (Haupt-Chef) — at the Cologne Communist trial in 1852, a Prussian 
police official, Stieber, thus called agent provocateur Cherval, seeking to ascribe to 
him the leading role in the Communist League and create an impression that he 
had contacts with Marx and the accused in the trial (see Marx's pamphlet Revela­
tions  Concerning  the Communist Trial in  Cologne,  present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 407-
19).—347 
405 Liebknecht was in prison from 15 October 1882; Bebel received a jail sentence to 
begin on 1 November 1882 and served it in the Leipzig prison until 9 March 
1883.—348,  350, 453

406 According to the Bible, during the  Jews'  flight from Egyptian captivity, the weak-
spirited among them, driven by hunger and privation, began to yearn for the days 
spent in captivity, when they were at least well fed.— 349 
407 Engels is referring to August Bebel's article 'Aufhebung des Sozialistengesetzes?' in 
Der Sozialdemokrat,  No. 42, 12 October 1882, directed against two Vollmar's arti­
cles printed in Der Sozialdemokrat and as a separate pamphlet (see Note 383). Be­
bel's critique was spearheaded mostly against Vollmar's second article, in which 
the author advocated putsch tactics and a secret organisation of the party. Bebel 
denounced these tactics as unacceptable and even fatal for the party. In a letter to 
Engels of 1 October 1882, he explained that the imprudent language and tone of 
the articles like those by Vollmar could well entail unnecessary losses in the 
party.—349, 357 
408 Lassalle's tenet that, with respect to the proletariat, all the other classes were 'one 
reactionary mass' was incorporated in the programme of the Social-Democratic 
Party of Germany approved at the Gotha Congress (see Note 381). For a criticism 
of this tenet, see Marx's work 'Critique of the Gotha Programme' (present edition, 
Vol. 24, pp. 88-89). In this letter, Engels uses the phrase 'single reactionary 
mass'.—349, 357 
409 After Bebel's critique of Vollmar's articles published as a separate pamphlet under 
the pen-name 'Surtur' (see Note 383), the Right-wing Social Democrat Louis Vie­
reck stated in his newspaper  Süddeutsche  Post that the pamphlet did not express the 
opinion of the party. Der Sozialdemokrat (No. 44, 26 October 1882) protested at 
Viereck's statement, stressing that the articles comprising the pamphlet were writ­
ten by a party member and originally published by the party's printed organ.— 
350 
410 Léon Picard's article mentioned here appeared in Le Citoyen  on 3 September 1882 
under the heading 'L'afTaire de la rue Saint-Marc'. Chauvinistic in spirit, it was 
disclaimed by the editorial board. The article set the German refugees against the 
Guesdists (for details, see Engels' letter to Bernstein of 4 November 1882, this 
volume, pp. 359-60).—352, 354, 360

October 1882 and 13 January 1883.-353, 363, 368, 406, 419, 429, 430 
412 The Cuban revolutionaries General Antonio Maceo and two of his fellow-officers 
arrested by the Spanish government escaped from prison in Cadiz in August 1882 
and sought political asylum in the Gibraltar fortress on British territory. On 20 
August they arrived at the fortress but were instantly arrested and handed over to 
the Spanish police. At the House of Commons sittings of 31 October and 7 Novem­
ber, members of Gladstone's Liberal government (Ashley, Charles Dilke et al.) at­
tempted to justify the Gibraltar authorities. At the same time, they denied that the 
government in London had anything to do with the matter.—  353,  365, 373

ficer of Napoleon's expeditionary corps  in August  1799. It had a  text carved  out on 
it in the  Egyptian hieroglyphic, Egyptian demotic  and  Greek languages.  In 1822, 
the hieroglyphic text  was  deciphered  by the  French scholar  J. F.  Champollion. 
The slab  is kept  at the  British Museum  in London.—  354 
4,6 The  reference  is to the  conflict between Guesde's followers  and  anarchist Godard, 
whom they accused  of taking  a bribe from  the  French  gas  company.  In a  letter  to 
Engels that has not  survived, Bernstein probably voiced  his disapproval  of the 
Guesdists' stand  in the  Godard affair. 
On the  comparative prestige  of the  parties that were formed after  the  split  of 
the French Workers' Party  at the  St-Etienne Congress,  see Engels' letter  to Bern­
stein  of 28  November  1882  (this volume,  pp.  386-90)  in which Engels used the 
information contained  in Lafargue's letter  of 24  November.— 355,  383, 389 
4" Engels uses the old  battle  cry, 'Hie Welf, Hie  Waibling!',  of the two  rival medieval 
political parties, of which  one  supported  the Welf, and the  other,  the Hohenstaufen 
(or Waibling, from  the name  of their family residence  and the  town), dynasty.  The 
cry sounded  for the  first time,  or so the  legend  has it,  during  the battle  at Weins-
berg  in 1140.  Later,  at the  time  of the struggle between  the Popes  and the  German 
emperors  in Italy  in the  12th-15th centuries,  the rivalry  was  between  the Guelphs 
and the  Ghibellines  (the  German names changed Italian-fashion).—  357

425 This probably refers to the account of the National Committee report at the 
St-Etienne Congress (see Note 394) printed in Le Prolétaire.  The report was spearhead­
ed, almost in toto, against Guesde, Lafargue and other leaders of the revolution­
ary section of the Workers' Party of France and included a one-sided selection of 
fragments from Lafargue's letters to Benoît Malon. The Editors are not in posses­

between Miesbach and Munich.— 364, 374, 449 
427 Marcel Deprez published the results of his research into electricity mostly in the 
journal La Lumière  Electrique  for 1881 and 1882. His works on electric power trans­
mission appeared in the journal Electricité for 1881.—  364 
428 Marx is referring to the sensational news concerning the participation of Rivers 
Wilson, managing director of the English Public Debts Administration, and of 
Lord Sherbrooke as proxies and trustees of the Texas Galveston and Eagle railway 
joint-stock company. As a result of the M.P.s' interpellations in the House of Com­
mons on 6 November 1882 pertaining to the incompatibility of British officials 
holding responsible jobs in the finances with their participation as trustees in specu­
lative ventures, Rivers Wilson and Lord Sherbrooke were forced to divest them­
selves of the powers of company trustees.— 365, 376

Commons on 6 and 7 November 1882.— 365 
430 The second edition of Alexander Redgrave's book The Factory and Workshop Act,

433 Marx probably referred to William Langland's allegoric poem The Vision of Wil­
liam concerning  Piers the Plowman,  together  with Vita de Do-wel, Do-bet, et Do-best, sec­
undum Wit et Resoun. There arc three versions of the poem. A volume containing 
them all was published by the Early English Text Society in 1867-85. (The Society

ciety of Political Economists in connection with the Chinese emigration to Califor­
nia. Participants in the meeting praised the cheap Chinese labour. This event was 
also covered by Le Revue  socialiste  (No. 9,  5 July 1880) in the article 'La Question 
chinoise devant les économistes', signed 'B. M.'. Its author was probably Benoît 
Malon.—372

and 49 on 9, 16 and 30 November 1882 under the heading 'Zur Spaltung der fran­
zösischen Arbeiterpartei' and signed 'V.'. The articles were a response to the piece 
called 'St. Etienne oder Roanne?', which appeared in Der Sozialdemokrat,  Nos. 41, 
42 and 44 on 5, 12 and 26 October 1882. The last one was signed 'Leo' (Bernstein's 
pen-name).—373,  379, 386, 408 
439 Engels is referring, above all, to Dialectics of Nature (see Note 449).— 377 
440 The reference is to the legal proceedings instituted against Guesde, Lafargue and 
other activists of the French Workers' Party for the speeches they had made in 
Lyons, Roanne, Montluçon, Bézenet, and Saint-Chamond, among other places, 
after the Roanne Congress (see Note 394). Guesde and Bazin were summoned by 
the examining magistrate Edouard Piquand to the court of the first instance in 
Montluçon for 14 November, and Lafargue, for 21 November on the charge of in­
stigation to civil war, assassination, burglary and arson (see Note 444), but the sus­
pects publicly refused to appear before the jury. Lafargue, who had been staying in 
Paris since 7 October, was arrested by the Paris police on 12 December. In late 
April 1883, the jury of the town of Moulins sentenced Lafargue, Guesde and Dor-
moy to six months' imprisonment and a fine. Guesde and Lafargue served their sen­
tences in the Ste Pélagie prison in Paris from 21 May  1883.—  378,  397, 401,

notes concerning the method of substantiating the differential calculus indepen­
dently worked out by Marx (see also Engels' letter to Marx of 18 August 1881,

Marxists (collectivists), on the one hand, and the petty-bourgeois anarchists and 
Proudhonists, on the other, the Marxists headed by Jules Guesde got the upper 
hand. The congress passed a number of decisions of fundamental significance: on

the nationalisation of the industries and landed property; on the seizure of political 
power by the workers, on the establishment of a party that assumed the official

449 Engels is referring to his manuscript Dialectics of Nature, specifically the article en­
titled 'The Measure of Motion.— Work'. 
Dialectics of Nature (present edition, Vol. 25, pp. 313-588) was the culmination 
of profound studies carried out by Engels over a number of  years.  Engels wrote the 
items included in Dialectics of Nature from 1873 to 1882 with intervals, during 
which time he studied a vast amount of source material on major problems of the 
natural sciences and more or less completed ten articles and chapters and many 
notes and fragments, all in all, almost 200 sketches. After Marx's death, he became 
engrossed in work to complete and publish Capital and in the affairs of the inter­
national working-class movement, and had no choice but to stop work on Dialec­
tics of Nature, which remained unfinished and unpublished in his lifetime (for

452 Engels intended to use these materials for a pamphlet about Bismarck and Lassalle 
(this volume, pp. 324-25). He did not carry out his plan.— 386 
453 The information and quotations concerning the balance of power between the 
Possibilists and the Guesdists after the split in the French Workers' Party (see Note 
394) were contained in Lafargue's letter to Engels of 24 November 1882.— 387 
454 Fédération du Nord (Northern Federation), which was formed in the spring of 
1880,  was one of the six federations into which the French Workers' Party had 
been organisationally divided prior to its split (see Note 394). The Northern Fed­
eration united the party branches in Lille and Roubaix. After the split at the 
St-Etienne Congress, it sided with the Marxists.— 387, 408 
4 5 5 The reference is to the Preamble to the Programme of the French Workers' Party 
drawn up by Marx (see present edition, Vol. 24, p. 340).— 387 
456 Engels alludes to the stand taken by Johannes Miquel, a former member of the 
Communist League and later a National Liberal and minister in the Prussian gov­
ernment. Miquel's departure from the revolutionary stand was apparent even in 
his letters to Marx of  6 April and 15 August 1856. Miquel maintained that a revo­
lution in Germany was not 'all that near' and that during it the proletariat should 
form a firm alliance not only with the petty but with the liberal bourgeoisie as well, 
and after its victory adopt tactics that would not alienate the bourgeoisie.—  388,  449 
45' This refers to the St-Etienne and Roanne congresses (see Note 394).— 389 
458 A reference to the exposure of the German agent provocateur Johann Karl Fried-
rich Elias Schmidt in Zurich. The Sozialdemokrat editors brought forth a pamphlet 
Die deutsche Geheimpolizei  im Kampfe mit der  Sozialdemokratie.  Aktenstücke und Enthül­
lungen auf Grund  authentischen  Materials dargestellt (Hottingen-Zurich, 1882) that 
described the machinations of Schmidt and his superiors. It was reprinted there in 
the same year with the same subtitle under the heading Deutsche Polizeischufte­
reien.—  390, 436 
459 Engels is referring to Bebel's letter of 14 November 1882 written in the Leipzig 
prison in reply to Engels' letter of 28 October 1882 (see this volume, pp. 349-
51).—390, 392 
460 Engels is referring, above all, to Marx's unfinished work on Polish history which he 
was writing in 1863 and which involved the use of the book  Vom Entstehen  und Unter­
gange der  polnischen  Konstitution vom 3-ten May 1791, Parts I-II, 1793 (it was pub­
lished anonymously in Leipzig; its authors were J. Potocki, H. Kollantaj and 
F. K. Dmochowski). The extant sketches for the work, which Marx planned to 
entitle Deutschland und Polen. Politisch-militärische Betrachtungen bei Gelegenheit des 
Polnischen Aufstands von 1863, and the notes he had made for it were published 
in: K. Marx, Manuskripte über die  polnische  Frage (1863-1864), Amsterdam, 1961, 
and, in Russian and German, in: Marx-Engels Archives, Vol. XIV, Moscow, 
1973.  The mistakes that occurred in the original publication when deciphering

moderna'. Candelari had several more polemical articles printed by the newspa­
per, among them 'De Laveleye e Rodbertus' (No. 14, 15 October 1882), which 
contained Laveleye's pronouncements concerning Marx's theory of value. 
Candelari's articles also appeared in Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18 of La Plebe of 22 
and 29 October and 5 and 12 November 1882. Issue No. 17 also carried Carlo Ca-
fiero's letter to the editors called 'Polemica'.— 392 
463 The reference is to the British trade union delegation headed by the editor of The 
Labour  Standard George Shipton which visited France in late 1882. (On the purpose 
of the visit, see this volume, pp. 359-60.)  —393,  394, 396 
464 Tlingits — a group of Indian tribes inhabiting south-eastern Alaska. 
By 'once Russian America' Engels is referring to Russia's possessions in North 
America (Alaska), which, under the treaty of 30 March 1867, the Russian govern­
ment sold to the United States for $7.2 mln. 
In 1880-81,  Marx wrote down a detailed synopsis of Lewis H. Morgan's book 
Ancient  Society  or Researches  in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery,  through  Barba­
rism into Civilization, London, 1877. It was published as 'Marx's Excerpts from 
Lewis Henry Morgan's Ancient History', in The  Ethnological Notebooks  of Karl Marx, 
Assen, 1972, pp.  95-241. 
Morgan built his research of primitive society on studies into the gentile com­
munities of North American Indians, including the Iroquois, a group of tribes liv­
ing in the north-east of the USA.— 395 
465 Georg Ludwig von Maurer's works on the agrarian, urban and state system in me­
dieval Germany are: Einleitung zur  Geschichte  der Mark-, Hof-,  Dorf-  und Stadt-

466 Enge]s  Wrote these lines to Marx on Laura Lafargue's letter of 12 December 1882. 
Laura informed him that Paul Lafargue had just been arrested by the Paris police 
and, under its orders, was to be sent to Montluçon to stand for trial there.— 396 
467 Affaires  véreuses cabinet  (cabinet of black affairs, or black cabinet) — a secret estab­
lishment at the postal departments of France, Prussia, Austria and some other 
states that opened and inspected correspondence; had existed since the time of the 
absolutist monarchies in Europe.— 398 
46 8 A reference to the events in the period when the Tudors' absolutist monarchy was 
being established in England following the War of the Roses (1455-85). The war 
was caused by the conflict between the feudal lords that grouped around two rival 
royal dynasties, the Lancasters and the Yorks. The founder of the dynasty, Henry 
VII Tudor, who had defeated King Richard III of York, made an attempt to 
sanctify the dynasty, seeking to consolidate the monarchy and his claim to the 
throne, which he based on his kinship with the Lancasters. With this end in view, 
in 1506 he requested Pope Julius II to canonise one of the Lancasters, King Henry 
VI, who had been dethroned by the Yorks at the time of the War of the Roses.— 
399 
469 Marx probably arrived at this conclusion after reading the book by V. V.

472 The Thirty Years' War (1618-48) — a European war in which the Pope, the Span­
ish and the Austrian Habsburgs and the German Catholic princes rallied under 
the banner of Catholicism and fought against the Protestant countries, Bohemia, 
Denmark, Sweden, the Republic of the Netherlands and a number of German 
states.  The rulers of Catholic France — rivals of the Habsburgs — supported the 
Protestant camp. Germany was the principal battleground and the chief object 
of plunder and the belligerents' aggressive claims. The war ended with the signing 
of the Westphalian Peace Treaty, which fixed Germany's political fragmentat­
ion.—404, 448

474 A reference to a postcard from Johann Philipp Becker to Engels of 13 December 
1882.  For Engels' reply, see this volume, pp. 405-07.— 404 
475 Engels is referring to Marx's lengthy studies of writings on the commune and forms 
of communal property, and the Russian village commune in particular, as part of 
his research into land rent and agrarian relations in general. Specifically, some­
what earlier Marx had made a thorough study,of Kovalevsky's book Communal 
Land Ownership: the Causes,  Course  and  Consequences  of Its Disintegration (1879), from 
which he copied out passages on the character of the commune and its place and 
socio-economic role at different times and among different peoples.— 408 
476 This refers to the Socialist Republican Alliance founded in Paris in October 1880 
by a group of amnestied Communards. Among them were noted and influential fi­
gures in the working-class and democratic movement, former members of the 
International Working Men's Association and its General Council. The members 
of the Alliance declared themselves socialists, but refused to be committed to any 
doctrine whatsoever. In early 1881, the Alliance fell apart.— 408 
477 The reference is to Sergei Podolinski's article Tl socialismo e l'unità délie forze fi-
siche', which was first published in 1881 in La Plebe, Anno XIV, Nuova série, 
No. 3, pp. 13-16, and No. 4, pp. 5-15, and then reprinted by the German journal 
Die Neue Ze^i%- 1>  18^3, pp. 413-24, and 449-57, under the heading 'Menschliche 
Arbeit und Einheit der Kraft'. — 410

easy about Jenny Longuet's health and that the latter should consult a doctor.— 
413, 417 
479 Weitlingianism  — the doctrine of Utopian egalitarian communism advocated by 
Wilhelm Weitling that gained some currency among German craftsmen. In the 
early 1840s, it had had a certain progressive role, but later, since it rejected the need 
for active political struggle on the part of the proletariat and advocated sectarian, 
conspiratorial methods, it began to act as a brake on the evolution of the German 
workers' class awareness. The reactionary features of Weitling's doctrine, which 
gradually acquired a religious, Christian colouring, became more and more ap­
parent with the passage of  time.  Neglect of the laws of history and dogmatism typi­
cal of the doctrine led to scientific methods and the need for a bourgeois-
democratic stage in the revolution in Germany being ignored, and to excessive 
stress on the role of personality in history.— 413 
480 At that time, Bebel was doing a 4-month jail sentence in the Leipzig prison (he was 
allowed to go and stay at home on 2-9 January 1883).— 414 
481 On the eve of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Bismarck made it understood to 
Napoleon III that, in exchange for France's neutrality, he would not hinder ex­
pansion of its territory at the expense of Belgium, Luxembourg and the German 
lands lying between the Rhine and the Moselle. On 6 August 1866, the French 
government demanded that Bismarck pay the promised compensation, insisting 
that the frontiers be changed back to those of 1814, the Prussian garrison with­
drawn from Luxembourg, and the latter's annexation by France be ensured. 
But Bismarck resolutely rejected these demands and responded to them on 19 
March 1867 by making public the Prussian secret alliance with the South German 
states of Baden and Bavaria concluded back in 1866. 
Referring to Bismarck's behaviour at that time, Engels implies his negotiations 
of 19 November 1882 with the Russian Foreign Minister Girs, who was asking for 
Germany's assistance for Russian policies in the East. After the negotiations, the 
German press featured notes and official articles on the alliance concluded by Ger­
many and Austria-Hungary back in 1879.— 415 
482 Xhis refers to Rodbertus' Briefe und  Socialpolitische  Aufsätze, published by Dr. Ru­
dolf Meyer (vols I-II, Berlin [1882]). In a letter to Engels of 14 November 1882, 
Bebel jokingly noted that Meyer was full of praise for Marx and Engels, flattered 
probably by his 'good reception' in London in 1879-80, but that they had to share 
the 'glory' with 'the five cardinals who had honoured him in the same manner'.—

Egypt (see Note 355) in his speech in Newcastle on 8 January  1883.—  423 
488 Marx is probably referring to the events of 1847. On 28 March 1847, the  Deutsche-
Brüsseler  Leitung, No. 25, carried an article about corn speculation written, presum­
ably, by Ferdinand  Wolff,  a member of the Communist League whose brother was 
a corn profiteer.— 425

49 ' Engels is referring to the speech made by the Social-Democratic deputy Karl Gril-
lenberger at the Reichstag meeting on 14 December 1882. It was spearheaded 
against Minister of the Interior Robert Victor von Puttkamer, who tried to justify 
the need for the introduction of a state of siege in several regions of Germany in 
connection with the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 16), insisting that Social Demo­
cracy was undermining the sanctity of the family and advocating free love. The  ref­
erence is also to the Sozialdemokrat articles dealing with Grillenberger's speech, 
'Aus Grillenberger's Rede über die Handhabung des Sozialistengesetzes' (Nos. 
1 and 2,  1 and 4 January); 'Zum Kapitel von der freien Liebe. Etwas für Herrn von 
Puttkamer zum Vorlesen im Reichstage' (No. 2, 4 January); 'Puttkamer und die 
"Heiligkeit" der Familie' (No. 3,  11 January); 'Zum Kapitel von der freien Liebe. 
Den Herren v. Puttkamer und v. Nostiz Wallwitz gewidmet' and 'Von der paten­
tierten Ehre' (No. 9, 22 February 1883).—  431,  455

generals of cavalry.— 431

Nassau and the Electorate of  Hesse,  as well as the free city Frankfurt am Main — 
as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the unification of Germany.— 
432 
494 During his stay in London in May 1882, Paul Singer discussed with Engels the at­
titude the Social-Democratic Party should take to Bismarck's policies, which prob­
ably compelled Singer to modify his stand.— 433 
495 Engels compares Kautsky's book Der Einfluss der  Volksvermehrung  auf den Fortschritt 
der Gesellschaft (1880), which defended the 'sound core' of Malthus' theory, with 
his own pamphlet Die  überseeische  Lebensmittel-Konkurrenz, which was an off-print 
from Staatswirthschaftliche Abhandlungen (Serie II, Heft IV und V, 1881).— 434 
496 Engels is referring to Hegel's idea of the objectively existing dialectical contradic­
tion in things and processes, which Dühring attacked in his book Kritische  Geschichte 
der Nationalökonomie  und des  Socialismus. — 434 
497 In the first part of his work Die  überseeische Lebensmittel-Konkurrenz  (Leipzig, 1881) 
(see Note 495), Kautsky makes use of the information on the forms of agriculture 
in Canada supplied by Rudolf Meyer to the Viennese newspaper Das Vaterland. —

articles Die Entstehung der Ehe und Familie in the Darwinist journal Kosmos (Stutt­
gart, Jg. VI, Bd. XII, October 1882-March 1883). The second article was called 
'Die Raubehe und das Mutterrecht. Der Clan', and the third, 'Die Kaufehe und 
die patriarchalische Familie'. In 1883, they were published as a separate edition 
under the general heading of the series.— 437, 450, 451

of all members of the commune to remove the fences around their land plots for the

nal pasture in the meantime.— 438 
500 Enge]s  may be  referring to the letter to the French Minister of Justice signed by 
Lafargue and Guesde and printed by L'Égalité' on 16 February 1883. The letter 
was entitled 'Deux noveaux prétendants'. In an ironic manner, Guesde and La­
fargue demanded a milder punishment for themselves, equal to that reserved for 
royalty, for, considering the morals of the French monarchs, was anybody able to 
vouch that the accused did not have royal blood in their veins? — 441 
501 Engels had first despatched this letter to be approved by Schorlemmer but by an 
oversight must have omitted to address it, and it was returned to the author. It was 
sent by Engels to Bernstein alongside with another letter, that of 27 February-
1 March 1883 (see this volume, pp. 445-50).—442

secret contacts with the bourgeois press and embezzlement of party funds.— 447 
508 Eduard Bernstein wrote to Engels on 24 February 1883 that as far as he knew, 
Georg Schumacher in Solingen was agitating for the  Süddeutsche  Post and urging 
the workers to read that newspaper and not Der Sozialdemokrat. Replying on 
7 March to this letter by Engels Bernstein wrote that the things said about Schu­

511 Engels' telegram to Sorge of 14 March 1883- was published in the New Yorker 
Volkszeitung without Engels' knowledge (the editors added the word 'afternoon') 
to create the impression that the telegram had been addressed to the newspaper. 
For the telegram that Engels did send to the paper, see present edition, Vol. 24, 
p. 462. 
Engels voiced his protest at the editors' high-handedness in a letter to the New

Academy of Agriculture in Moscow in his article 'On the Death of Karl Marx' 
printed by Der Sozialdemokrat, 3 and 17 May 1883 (see present edition, Vol. 24, 
pp. 473-81).—464 
5" In a letter of 16 March 1883, Theodor Cuno asked Engels to confirm that Marx 
was called Mohr by his family. Cuno wanted to mention it in his article about 
Marx. Hepner, however, asserted that Marx had never had such a nickname and 
that mentioning it could only 'harm' the party.— 466 
518 The Communards were amnestied in July 1880.— 469 
5,9 A reference to the mounting political tension in Ireland in the late 1870s-early 
1880s engendered by the campaign for Home Rule and by the people's protest ac­
tion against the landlords (see notes 124 and 139).— 471 
520 Probably a reference to 4 August 1789, when, pressed by the mounting peasant 
movement, the French Constituent Assembly solemnly removed feudal duties and 
taxes,  which had by that time been abolished, to all practical purposes, by the in­
surgent peasants. However, the laws that were later promulgated abrogated only 
the personal duties without redemption fees. The abolition of all feudal duties 
without redemption payments was not carried out until the time of the Jacobean 
dictatorship by the law of 17 July  1793.—  473
